11020646,"The US opioid crisis continues to have a catastrophic impact on human lives and the ongoing COVID-19
pandemic is compounding its effects. Based on the statistics published by the CDC, 91,799 drug overdose
deaths occurred in the US in 2020, where the age-adjusted overdose deaths increased by 31% from 2019 to
2020. In addition, opioids, which cause respiratory depression, were involved in 75% of all drug overdose
deaths in the US. We propose to build on our work in non-invasive monitoring of vital signs to develop an FDA-
regulated medical device with a primary application in monitoring patients for opioid-induced respiratory
depression. This includes at-home monitoring of patients with chronic pain being treated with high-dose opioid
prescription medications or patients suffering from opioid use disorder (OUD) as well as monitoring subjects
with OUD at supervised injection sites (also known as supervised consumption spaces). Our overall goal is to
develop a non-contact multi-modal monitoring system for the detection of opioid-induced respiratory
depression at home and in supervised injection sites. While radar is capable of penetrating through clothing
and blankets to measure chest wall movements resulting from respiration, it requires the guidance of depth
imaging to target a person and the chest area. Our specific aims are: 1. Estimate tidal volume using a
noncontact monitoring system. Our current technology is capable of detecting respiratory rate with a high
degree of accuracy for stationary subjects. However, robust detection of respiratory depression involves
monitoring of respiratory rate, pattern, and depth (i.e., tidal volume). As part of this specific aim, we will develop
a framework to estimate tidal volume of a stationary subject using radar and depth information, where we
estimate tidal volume from chest wall displacements. Furthermore, we will extract features to characterize
respiratory pattern from the acquired radar signal. As a primary validation of this estimation framework, our
system will be tested on 20 healthy volunteers. The outcome of the test will provide us with preliminary data
regarding the accuracy of the radar and the depth-based tidal volume estimation as compared with the gold
standard. 2. Develop and validate a framework for integrating data from sensors to detect respiratory
depression. In this specific aim, we will develop a framework to use the respiratory rate, respiratory pattern,
and tidal volume information from the radar and depth camera to determine if respiratory depression has
occurred. This involves a two-step approach, where we extract respiratory features to characterize respiratory
patterns to complement respiratory rate and tidal volume, and then use a machine learning model to detect the
occurrence of respiratory depression. To help with design the right model, we will collect data using our radar
and depth imaging system from anesthetized pigs going through opioid-induced respiratory depression."

NIA issued PA-18-025 to explore “…clinical translational potential of metformin to delay deleterious aging
changes or to extend healthy human life span.” Within PA-18-025 was the critical need to explore what factors
potentially modulate the clinical effectiveness of metformin before more costly large-scale clinical trials. Although
there is epidemiological support for health benefits of metformin in patient populations, it is not clear if these
protective effects extend to those free of disease. Therefore, there is a need to perform human studies
determining which subjects free of chronic disease benefit from metformin treatment. Retrospective analysis of
a randomized, double-blinded clinical trial in our lab revealed that subjects who were insulin sensitive had no
effect or negative effects on insulin sensitivity when taking metformin during an exercise training program. These
data suggest that in some subjects, metformin has detrimental metabolic outcomes that could accelerate aging.
There are data both in support of and refuting that metformin inhibits mitochondrial complex I action and/or
mitochondrial remodeling. The overall objective of this application is to determine if subjects currently free of
disease benefit from metformin treatment. There are two critical questions that remain unanswered in human
subjects: 1) does antecedent metabolic health influence responses to metformin, and 2) does long-term
treatment with metformin lead to mitochondrial remodeling and changes in function. To better understand the
translational potential of a clinically relevant dose of metformin for the prevention of chronic conditions, this
proposal aims to determine how antecedent metabolic health affects the response to metformin treatment, and
identify the relationship between skeletal muscle mitochondrial remodeling and mitochondrial function with
metformin treatment. The hypotheses are that: 1) metformin treatment in subjects free of T2D will improve insulin
sensitivity and glucoregulation in insulin resistant individuals, but will decrease insulin sensitivity and
glucoregulation in insulin sensitive subjects, and 2) long-term metformin treatment will remodel mitochondria in
a way that decreases mitochondrial function in subjects that are insulin sensitive, but improves mitochondrial
function in subjects that are insulin resistant. To test these hypotheses, a 12-week randomized, double-blind
clinical trial will be performed in subjects 40-75 yrs of age, free of disease, and stratified by insulin sensitivity
(insulin sensitive and insulin resistant). Pre and post-training assessments include the hyperinsulinemic-
euglycemic clamp to measure hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity, continuous glucose monitoring to
determine glucoregulation, and proposed blood-based biomarkers of aging. Further, the use of novel stable
isotope labeling with proteomic analysis will determine individual and complex-specific mitochondrial remodeling.
This approach will be combined with analysis of protein modification and turnover to comprehensively analyze
mitochondrial effects of metformin treatment in skeletal muscle. By completion of this project, it is expected that
there will be evidence that helps further delineate who may benefit from metformin treatment to slow aging."
10791775,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Psychotic disorders are characterized by high rates of suicidal ideation and behavior, and the risk for
suicide appears to be greatest during the earliest stages of psychosis. A recent meta-analysis
showed that the majority of youth at clinical high-risk (CHR) for psychosis experience suicidal
ideation, and that approximately one in five make at least one suicide attempt. There are, however,
no suicide prevention interventions specifically tailored to the needs of transition-aged youth at CHR,
and no current best practice guidelines for how to respond to suicide risk in this population. The
Youth-Nominated Support Team (YST) intervention has recently been shown to reduce mortality
among adolescents and is potentially highly adaptable within the context of existing CHR services.
YST is intended as an adjunctive treatment and is primarily delivered towards support persons rather
than the youth themselves, and therefore would not interfere or overlap with the already extensive
direct services provided in CHR treatment settings. The proposed project intends to adapt the YST
intervention for CHR populations and to provide pilot efficacy data for a larger subsequent
randomized trial. Specifically, we aim to: (1) adapt YST for CHR based on stakeholder input (i.e.,
clients, family/friends, clinicians) and to develop a new treatment manual; (2) to implement YST in a
single CHR clinic and to revise the intervention based on input from clients, providers, and support
persons, and (3) to conduct a pilot randomized clinical trial at four SAMHSA funded CHR sites. For
the first stage of this study, we intend to conduct six focus groups (two of clients, two of family
members, and two of clinicians) to gather input on needs and preferences regarding suicide
prevention. This information will be incorporated into the YST protocol through expert consensus
meetings (i.e., study investigators, clinicians, and consultants) and used to develop a treatment
manual. During the second stage of the project, we will conduct a small feasibility study using this
intervention manual at the primary study site (N=8), and will again gather input from clients, providers,
and support persons to further revise the treatment manual. In the final stage, we will conduct a pilot
randomized clinical trial of the adapted YST intervention at four CHR clinics (N=70), comparing the
adapted YST intervention to an active control condition consisting of safety planning, crisis resources,
and means restriction. The proximal targets will be social connectedness, hope, and treatment
engagement, and the distal targets suicidal ideation and behavior (e.g., attempts, preparatory
actions). This study will provide the first clinical trial data for targeted suicide prevention among the
CHR population. Findings will inform best practices for addressing suicide risk in the CHR phase of
illness and facilitate the development of a subsequent larger randomized clinical trial incorporating
additional CHR clinics to further test the efficacy of the adapted YST intervention and to identify
underlying mechanisms of change."

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and lethal primary brain tumor with the median survival of 9.7 months.
The current standard of care treatment involves a combination of surgery, chemotherapy and radiation but only
improve the median survival up to 14 months. Challenges in discovery of therapeutics for GBM include identifying
drug targets and discovering therapeutics that are blood brain barrier (BBB) permeable. To meet the challenges,
we have identified small ubiquitin-related modifier 1 (SUMO1) as an oncoprotein that drives the self-renewal and
tumorigenesis of GBM stem cells. We have designed GBM cell-based SUMO1 assay, screened the compounds
library provided by the National Cancer Institute, and identified the hit compound as the first small molecule
degrader that induces SUMO1 ubiquitination and degradation in GBM cells. Structure-activity relationship (SAR)
studies around the hit-derived analogs have generated three scaffolds of lead compounds with improved potency
and an excellent BBB permeability. Using GBM stem cell-enriched neurospheres and derived xenografts, we
have shown that the lead compounds are more effective in treatment of GBM than the standard chemotherapy
temozolomide (TMZ). In this R01 project, we will optimize our lead series with the aim of identifying more potent,
orally bioavailable and BBB-permeable SUMO1 degraders that will have the preclinical efficacy, safety, and
pharmacokinetic properties predicting it be enable full exploration in clinical treatment of GBM. To achieve this
objective, we will leverage our computational chemistry technology to assist the design of novel compounds with
BBB permeability and drug-like properties through chemical modifications of our lead series in Aim 1. Each of
compounds will be rationally designed, synthesized and assessed in our established compound testing funnel
for their activity and target selectivity in SUMO1 degradation. Compounds that meet our criteria for success will
be selected for in vitro solubility, permeability, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion assessment
and prioritized for the anticancer activity against GBM stem cell-enriched neurospheres. In Aim 2, the leading
compounds selected from the studies of Aim 1 will be evaluated for their pharmacokinetic properties to determine
oral bioavailability and BBB permeability. Selected compounds will be assessed for in vivo target engagement
and therapeutic efficacy in treatment of patient derived xenograft GBM models. The optimized lead compounds
selected from the studies in Aim 2 will be evaluated for their toxicology, safety pharmacology and oral formulation
in Aim 3. The milestone of this project is to select optimized lead compound(s) for advancement into preclinical
development phase, investigative new drug-enabling studies and phase I trials in treatment of GMB patients."
10791778,"All aerobic organisms continuously generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide anion and
H2O2 as natural products of metabolism. ROS are potentially damaging to biomolecules, but can also be
exploited by cells as weapons for attacking pathogens and as molecules for signaling. To balance the
beneficial and potentially harmful effects of ROS, aerobic organisms are armed with a suite of anti-oxidant
enzymes, and in eukaryotes, the only enzyme for superoxide is the superoxide dismutase (SOD). SODs use a
metal co-factor such as Cu to catalyze at extraordinary rates, the disproportination of superoxide to O2 and
H2O2. Until recently, the bimetallic Cu/Zn SOD was believed to be the only Cu SOD for eukaryotes, but in
2014, our lab discovered a new class of SODs that cannot bind Zn and lack sequences to cover the active site,
hence, a Cu-only SOD with a highly unusual solvent exposed Cu co-factor. Cu-only SODs are wide-spread
throughout the fungal kingdom as the sole extracellular SOD for fungi. In animals, the Cu-only SOD gene
underwent twice duplication, resulting in 4x tandem repeats of Cu-only SODs on a single polypeptide we call
CSRP (Cu-only SOD repeat protein). What sets the Cu-only SOD family apart from other SODs is their
restricted localization and unusual open active site. All Cu-only SODs and CSRP molecules are predicted to
be extracellular and remarkably, we find that Cu-only SODs do not acquire their Cu-cofactor from intracellular
metal pools, unlike other eukaryotic secreted cuproproteins. Instead, Cu-only SODs are activated outside the
cell by extracellular Cu. We hypothesize this new family of cuproproteins evolved to function exclusively
outside the cell in extracellular redox biology. Here we combine biophysical, structural biology, and cell biology
approaches to examine how the Cu site of Cu-only SODs is fine-tuned to capture Cu and not other metals
outside the cell, and how the enzyme functions with extracellular superoxide. In eukaryotes, the primary source
of extracellular superoxide is the NADPH oxidase (NOX), typically activated by Rho GTPases to produce ROS
for signaling. Recently, we uncovered a surprising NOX - Cu-only SOD partnership in a unicellular fungal
pathogen that represents a remarkably simple and unique form of Rho GTPase control of ROS. We will
elucidate the mechanism underlying this redumentary system for ROS signaling and define how pathogenic
yeasts can use Cu-only SODs and ROS to signal polarized growth. CSRP may likewise function in pathways
involving NOX and ROS signaling. Using a vertebrate model, we find CSRP most abundantly expressed in
tissues with a high capacity for regeneration by signaling through ROS. Our goals are to uncover the
biochemical activities of CSRP and elucidate its function in possible relationship to NOX in tissues with high
regenerative capacity. It is remarkable that nature has designed two distinct variations of Cu-containing SODs:
the Cu/Zn versus the Cu-only. Our studies promise to uncover how the Cu-only SODs are specialized to
operate outside the cell in redox and/or metallobiology."

unknown, extremely low efficiency. Compared to single CTCs, clusters of multicellular CTCs possess 20-100

previous studies identified that in addition to collective migration and cohesive shedding, tumor cell aggregation
is a new mechanism for CTC cluster formation, enhancing cancer stemness and polyclonal metastasis. The
objectives of this proposal are to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying CD44 and PAK2-promoted

10816611,"Despite advancements, about 700,000 people in the U.S. still experience an ischemic stroke annually.
Current treatments for acute ischemic stroke are largely restricted to thrombolysis or thrombectomy, for which
many stroke patients are ineligible for. Therefore, developing novel therapies for stroke is a significant public
health need. Understanding the cellular mechanisms underlying stroke is critical for the development of new
stroke therapies. Neutrophils and platelets are critical regulators of ischemic stroke injury. In humans and
mice, platelet-neutrophil aggregates increase after ischemic stroke as well do neutrophil extracellular traps
(NETs), a marker of neutrophil activation. NETs are critical during inflammation and infection and are released
by neutrophils to trap pathogens. While NETs help fight infection, excessive NET formation can be
detrimental to the host by promoting thrombosis. However, the pathological role of NET release has not been
studied in ischemic stroke injury. Furthermore, the molecular regulators that trigger NET formation during
stroke remain unclear. Finally, if targeting NET release during ischemic stroke injury improves outcomes is
completely unknown. Here, we will test the innovative hypothesis that platelets are a primary driver of
NET release during ischemic stroke and targeting NET formation with a novel, endogenous NET-
inhibitory factor (nNIF), will improve stroke outcomes. We will employ complementary clinical, in vitro,
and in vivo approaches, along with state-of-the-art techniques and models to rigorously test this hypothesis.
Specific Aim 1 will determine if NETs are released after ischemic stroke and if they are present in the brains
of human stroke patients and mice after experimental stroke. Furthermore, we will examine if neutrophils are
primed to release NETs in ischemic stroke patients. Specific Aim 2 will establish whether platelet high
mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a danger associated molecular pattern released by platelets after activation,
regulates NET formation during ischemic stroke injury. Specific Aim 3 will determine if therapeutic nNIF
administration blocks NET formation during experimental stroke and improves acute and long-term stroke
outcomes, including motor and neurological function. Successful completion of these aims will 1) determine if
NETs are present in ischemic stroke injury including intravascular and extravascular locations; (2) establish
whether neutrophils and platelets are primed to participate in NET formation during ischemic stroke, (3)
determine whether platelet HMGB1 is a critical regulator of platelet-mediated NETosis during ischemic stroke;
and (4) determine if NET inhibition improves stroke outcomes and the therapeutic window associated with
pathological NET formation. Data generated in this proposal will significantly increase our understanding of
how platelets contribute to pathological NET formation during ischemic stroke and associated neurological
injury."
10817072,"Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is a newly recognized disorder characterized by the
ontogenesis of a genetically distinct, proliferative clonal leukocyte population. The prevalence of CHIP increases
with older age and is associated not only with risk of hematologic cancers, but with fibrosis, systemic
inflammation, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. Recapitulation of CHIP in mice by transplantation of
clonal leukocytes results in accelerated atherosclerosis, cardiac fibrosis and direct tissue infiltration of clonal
macrophages and stimulation of interstitial fibrosis.
Age is a dominant risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD), which is associated with accelerated
cardiovascular disease, premature death, and progression to dialysis dependence. The biological mechanisms
conferring this age-associated risk are incompletely understood. The final common pathologic process in
progressive CKD is tubulointerstitial fibrosis, which is characterized by the accumulation of inflammatory
infiltrates and fibroblasts within the kidney interstitium and permanent loss of tubular epithelial cells.
Tubulointerstitial fibrosis also represents the central underlying lesion in the progression of acute kidney injury
(AKI) to chronic disease.
Based on mechanistic links between CHIP and atherogenesis, kidney interstitial inflammation, and fibrosis, we
hypothesize that CHIP is a novel biological risk factor for CKD progression. To test this hypothesis, we propose
to determine the associations of CHIP with kidney disease progression in established cohorts of CKD and AKI.
In parallel, we propose to delineate potential causal mechanisms using recognized animal models of chronic
and acute kidney disease.
The identification of clonal leukocytes as a novel mechanism of CKD progression would represent a new disease
pathway that could motivate future targeted interventions."
10816901,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Obesity is a major risk factor for many chronic medical conditions, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease,
depression, and cancer. Elucidating the neural networks that regulate feeding behavior and body weight control
is critically needed towards the development of effective strategies to combat obesity and its co-morbidities. We
recently found that the ventral subiculum (vSub), a component of the hippocampal formation, provides
monosynaptic inputs to the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH). We further revealed that these VMH-projecting
vSub neurons are responsive to food, and chemogenetic activation of VMH-projecting vSub neurons suppresses
food intake in mice. However, we noted that the vSub→VMH circuitry has robust collateral projections to two
other brain regions, the lateral septum (LS) and the accumbens nucleus shell (AcbSh), which could also
contribute to the anorexigenic effects. Thus, our first objective is to systematically dissect which of these vSub
collaterals mediate anorexigenic action. Importantly, we will explore the physiological relevance of this circuit in
chronic feeding and weight regulation by using a mouse model with these vSub neurons genetically ablated. We
also found that cholinergic neurons in the diagonal band of Broca (DBBChAT neurons) provide extensive synaptic
inputs onto vSub neurons. The second objective of this research is to examine the effects of the DBBChAT→vSub
circuit on feeding, and to explore the physiological relevance of this upstream circuit in the chronic regulation of
proper feeding behavior and body weight control. Further, we found that vSub neurons abundantly express the
α7 subunit of nAChRs, and these cells can be activated by α7-nAChR agonists. Thus, the third objective of the
proposed research is to generate mice lacking α7-nChAR from vSub neurons, and use this model to elucidate
the physiological relevance of α7-nAChR within vSub circuitry towards feeding behavior and obesity
development. Together, these studies will rigorously examine the functions of both the downstream outputs and
upstream inputs of vSub neurons in feeding circuitry, and further identify the role of nAChR signaling in vSub
neurons that suppresses feeding. Accomplishment of these studies will fill a critical gap in knowledge by
identifying a novel neural circuit in the context of body weight regulation. Further, our results may provide needed
framework to develop novel therapeutic strategies towards obesity treatment."

 Given the substantial impacts that limited health literacy has on health outcomes, the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, American Academy of Pediatrics, World Health Organization, American School Health
Association, Indian Health Service, National Institute of Medicine, and the Society for Public Health Education,
among others, are calling for action to improve health literacy across all levels of the U.S. population. Native
Americans and Alaska Natives (NA/ANs), in particular, face significant challenges as co-occurring health
disparities and limited access to healthcare further compounds the problem of low health literacy, resulting in
elevated rates of poor health outcomes and lower life expectancy. Moreover, studies reveal that NA/AN
populations are amongst the highest at-risk for limited health literacy in the U.S., with only 7% demonstrating
proficiency on health literacy related tasks. These findings are concerning as limited health literacy adversely
impacts the use of preventative services, minimizes visits to healthcare facilities, increases nonadherence to
medical prescriptions, and leads to higher rates of preventable hospital visits and use of emergency services.
 In this Phase I SBIR application, we propose to develop a proof-of-concept for a commercially viable
technology-based solution, HealthyU-Native, designed to improve health literacy for secondary NA/AN students.
HealthyU-Native will be a web/mobile-app based, self-paced curriculum, featuring animated instructional videos,
live-action video modeling, graphics-rich printed materials, and engaging interactive games and activities. The
initial prototype will be adapted from the successful HealthyU program and will focus on critical health literacy
skills such as accessing and using insurance, medication management, responding to medical emergencies,
and accessing health-related resources and services in the community. The program will also feature culturally
relevant content, including navigating Indian Health Services and traditional NA/AM principles, ethics, and
practices in medical care.
 The prototype will be developed through an iterative design process in collaboration with NA/AN students
and key community members (i.e., elders, educators, and health providers). Following development, we will
assess program feasibility, usability, and improvements in knowledge and skill with 40 secondary NA/AN
students in preparation for a Phase II evaluation."

 Alcohol-associated liver disease (AALD) is a major driver of global liver-related morbidity and mortality.
Alcohol alone accounts for 30% to 50% of cirrhosis‐related deaths globally. At least half of people living with
type 2 diabetes have nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and are at higher risk to develop nonalcoholic or alcohol
associated steatohepatitis and cirrhosis. miRNA biomarker characterization is an emerging field for early
detection, monitoring and the evaluation of treatment response in disease conditions and clinical applications
of miRNA-based biomarkers is rapidly growing.
 Recently, miRNA-based diagnostics assays are being offered in clinical oncology that use widely
available RT-qPCR methodology. However, these assays are low throughput, and high turnaround time, due
to ability to perform analysis of only one miRNA/reaction. To date, there is no qPCR-based method available
that can detect multiple miRNAs in a single qPCR reaction. KASA BIO is developing Zip-Melt Multiplex miRNA
Solution that enables reverse transcription and detection of multiple miRNAs of interest. This novel solution
overcomes the limitations of current technologies for miRNA detection using RT-qPCR methodology. Our
proposed solution can detect multiple miRNAs from various sample matrices (tissue or body fluids) and will
provide a cost-effective, eco-friendly technology to meet the clinical requirement of multianalyte detection in a
single workflow. Compared to the existing kits, the advantage of our solution is that it is easy to use at various
research settings including resource limited setting such as point of care.
 This project proposes to develop Zip-MeltTM HepmiR Assay to determine analytical performance and
equivalence of Zip-Melt TM Multiplex miRNA Solution in comparison with commercially available RT-qPCR
Array and to use the Assay in clinical research to determine miRNA signatures important for liver diseases
(screening or diagnosis or monitoring). The proposed technology will have a significant impact on translational
research by providing an affordable multiplex miRNA qPCR solution for life sciences research and will
address the molecular diagnostic need."

Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) is the most common chronic respiratory disease in infants and is a
devastating condition that disrupts the developmental program of the lung secondary to preterm birth. Preterm
neonates exposed to mechanical ventilation develop moderate to severe BPD that affects their survival (10%
mortality) and respiratory function, and to date, there are no specific drugs available to prevent or treat this life-
threatening condition. The pathologic hallmarks of BPD are hyperoxia-induced pulmonary inflammation,
increased cell death, dysregulated angiogenic factors culminating in impaired alveolarization, dysregulated
vascularization of the lung and pulmonary hypertension. AyuVis Research, Inc, is developing a novel class of
low molecular weight natural oligosaccharide-derived small molecules and the lead compound AVR-48 which
activate macrophage to an intermediary phenotype via TLR4/CD163 signaling in human blood and mouse spleen
mononuclear cells. In both mouse and preterm lamb BPD models, the lead candidate AVR-48 block inflammatory
mediators in lung and upregulation of endogenous vascularization pathways. The lead compound AVR-48
enhances production of certain host anti-inflammatory molecule such as IL-10 and growth factor VEGF with
vascularization effects remaining local to lungs, improving lung vascularization/alveolization leading to improved
lung function and survival. AVR-48 also prevents the development of BPD associated pulmonary hypertension.
Importantly, we have assessed the Maximum Tolerated Dose and determined the NOAEL dose of AVR-48 in
both juvenile and adult rats, in adult dogs and efficacy/safety doses in preterm lamb BPD model via IV dosing,
which we will use to determine the dose ranges of our proposed clinical studies. We have demonstrated all these
above-mentioned therapeutic effects in two BPD models: intraperitoneal injection of AVR-48 prevents hyperoxia-
induced BPD in a neonatal mice pup model at 10mg/kg dose and intravenous injection in invasive mechanical
ventilator induced BPD in pre-term lambs at 3.0 mg/kg dose. In order to advance the lead candidate AVR-48,
AyuVis is submitting IND application to the FDA and preparing for Phase-1 and Phase-2a clinical trials. Here we
propose two clinical trial: 1) Evaluate the Safety and PK parameters of AVR-48 in a Phase-I SAD and MAD
clinical trial in healthy adult volunteers and 2) Evaluate the Safety, PK and efficacy of AVR-48 in an exploratory
Phase-2a clinical trial in pre-term infants at risk of developing BPD.
The completion of both clinical trials will provide the essential safety and pharmacokinetic data required to
continue the product development of AVR-48. The data yielded through the completion of the aims of this project
will lead the way to the development of future clinical project, including a Phase 2b/3 clinical trial aimed to assess
the efficacy of AVR-48 in preterm infants at risk of developing BPD using larger sample size. Ultimately, our
clinical pipeline will bring to market a prophylactic treatment for BPD, where there is a vastly unmet clinical need."
10824853,"Project Summary
The B cell compartment is comprised of many individual cells, each of which may express a distinct B cell
receptor (BCR). Upon antigen engagement, B cells proliferate resulting in clonal expansion, and may further
diversify their BCR genes through somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class switch recombination. These two
processes allow for affinity maturation toward the insulting antigen and the distribution of Ab reactivity across
isotypes which interface with other components of the immune system defining an Abs effector function. Clonal
expansion and diversification result in the presence of expanded groups of B cells with similar BCRs (clonal
lineages). The overarching goal of this program is to investigate the evolution and durability of immune responses
to allo, self, and foreign antigens. Although sequencing of BCR genes allows the visualization of cell expansions
and diversification that occur during the evolution of B cell responses, sequence information alone is insufficient
to evaluate changes in antigen binding that occur as immune responses evolve. The Antigen Receptor
Sequencing, Cloning, Expression, and Analysis Core (Core B) will facilitate the objectives of this program
by allowing the analysis of these two distinct but related features of humeral immunity. We will support the aims
of the projects through the following activities: i) Generating antigen receptor sequence information. Projects
require repertoire level sequence information form bulk and sorted lymphocytes, BCR for Projects 1 and 3, TCR
for Project 2. Core B will centralize the processing and quality control involved in generating next-generation of
antigen receptor libraries. We will coordinate with the Projects and with Core D, the Data and Informatics Service
Core, for analysis. ii) Generating Abs by cloning and expressing the BCR of single-sorted antigen-reactive B
cells as recombinant Ab. Both Projects 1 and 3 of this proposal are evaluating the reactivity of antigen-reactive
B cells to a variety of specificities, allo- and auto-HLA, and viral pathogen derived antigens. Using a high-
throughput Ab cloning and expression system, Core B will produce recombinant Abs from the cloned BCR of
single-sorted antigen reactive B cells across reactive with these antigens. iii) Evaluating the specificity, relative
affinity, and cross reactivity of Abs. Because understanding the effects of SHM, the relation of antigen reactivity
within and across expanded lineages, the relative affinity of Abs to their antigens and related structures requires
physical measurements of binding, Core B will evaluate Abs reactivity profiles using multiplexed cytometric
arrays. iv) Core B will generate Ab and Fab expression vectors to support the bio-physical measurements of Ab
binding and structural studies performed by Core C. Collectively, these activities will promote synergy between
the Projects and the Cores of this proposal and accelerate the research by providing access to specialized
techniques and reagents while centralizing approaches requiring technical expertise and instrumentation."
10824854,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Patients receiving organ transplants have the risk of organ rejection due to mismatched human leukocyte
antigens (HLA). Though organ recipients are screened for pre-formed anti-HLA antibodies (HLA-Abs) and are
cross-matched using donor cells and recipient serum prior to transplantation, up to 25% of kidney transplant
recipients will develop a new donor-specific HLA-Ab following transplant. Within that patient group, there is a 40%
decline in 10-year graft survival. At the heart of this negative outcome are antibody-secreting cells (ASCs), which
produce donor-specific Abs, and memory B cells (Bmems), which may provide help to alloreactive T cells and
differentiate into ASCs. Current immunosuppressive therapies aimed at depleting ASCs and Bmems are largely
ineffective. Thus, Ab-mediated rejection remains a significant clinical problem. The overall objective of this U19
Program is to define the factors that govern the evolution of memory lymphocyte responses over time and to
assess the durability of these responses. Two Projects in this U19 will specifically focus on characterizing the
evolution and durability of the Bmem and ASC subsets responsible for alloimmune responses elicited toward
donor-specific HLA Class-I and Class-II alleles. To perform these studies, Projects will require antigen-specific
reagents to aide in identification of antigen-specific B cells, clone B cell receptors, and further characterize
antigen to Ab interactions. One objective of the Immuno-Reagent Production, Validation, and Biophysical
Analysis Core (Core C) is to provide these reagents, which will include B cell tetramers (specific to HLA alleles
and respiratory viral antigens), Abs, Fabs, antigen-specific polyclonal antibodies (pAbs), and proteins for
structural studies. By centralizing the production and validation of proteins for distribution within the Program,
the expertise of Core C will allow Projects to focus on their own Aims, unimpeded by the time and effort to
develop these reagents on their own. A second objective of Core C is to function as a multidisciplinary biophysical
analysis center. In this capacity, we will coordinate with Projects to analyze antibody to antigen interactions.
Using surface plasmon resonance, we will develop an understanding of these interactions at the kinetic level.
Using X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy, we will observe epitope-paratope interfaces at near
atomic resolution. Lastly, we will perform proteomics experiments using mass spectrometry with pAbs to aide in
assigning pools of Abs to lineages. In summary, Core C will provide reagents to the exceptional group of
Immunologists in the Program to expedite their discoveries. Biophysical analyses will provide new innovation
and synergy to these groups. Structural biology will be a transformative tool for the Projects that will lead to
assignment of rules regarding HLA engagement by alloAbs. Filling this knowledge gap could lead to improved
donor-to-recipient HLA matching protocols and lower alloreactive Ab responses, leading to better long-term
outcomes in transplant patients."
10824855,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hypothesis-testing studies designed to understand the evolution and durability of B and T cell responses in the
contexts of alloreactivity, tissue residency and viral infection that are described in this proposal will rely on several
`omics and other data-rich approaches and corresponding analyses. To support use of these platforms and their
associated data analyses, we propose to provide unified and integrated data and informatics services in the
Data and Informatics Service Core (Core D). The core will cover two broad areas as reflected by the Specific
Aims: data management, including clinical data integration, and bioinformatic and statistical data analysis, both
primary (standardized pipelines) and downstream. In Specific Aim 1, we propose to oversee and implement data
management processes and systems applied to both raw and derived data as well as its integration with
corresponding clinical characteristics of human donors. These efforts will support raw-to-figure analytical
provenance and will benefit the Program by creating infrastructure that can be efficiently used by all the Projects
and Cores as well as promoting good data stewardship practices which in turn, support reproducibility. In Specific
Aim 2, we propose to implement standardized workflows to cover all of the high-throughput platforms used in
this Program (by one or more Projects and data generated by one or more Cores), including bulk B and T cell
receptor repertoire sequencing, single-cell sequencing applications (gene expression, VDJ, feature barcoding
for surface phenotyping and antigen specificity, spatial transcriptomics, multiome), analysis of antibody reactivity
profiles and other assays. This will benefit the Program by standardizing primary data processing across the
Projects and will promote comparability of results. Additionally, we will provide collaborative downstream
bioinformatics, analytical and statistical support for all three Projects. This will benefit the Program by serving as
a resource that all Investigators in the Projects can access for using data analyses to address their hypotheses,
and by centralizing this function, we will economize this support as the analytical needs and methodologies of
the Projects will overlap. To develop this Core, we have assembled a strong team with experienced leadership
and talented individuals with demonstrated expertise in all of the areas covered. Combining these two broad
areas into a Core will maximize efficiency, standardize processes, and promote scientific synergy across the
Program."
10824256,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The objective of the Stanford Research in Anesthesia Training Program (ReAP) is to train leaders in academic
anesthesia. We recognize that in order to accomplish this goal, substantial training beyond an MD or PhD is
required. ReAP provides the guidance, training, and mentoring critical for the successful initiation of an
independent research career and becoming a leader in the broad field of Anesthesiology. Trainees must learn
to pose important and well thought out questions, to think critically, and to use cutting edge interdisciplinary
tools to answer these questions. Success also requires the development of skills in presentation of results in
oral and written format, in preparation of competitive grant proposals, and in the ability to engage in
collaboration when this will more effectively advance the research. The training program starts by recruiting the
most talented trainees from MD/PhD, MD and, occasionally, PhD applicants interested in pursuing a career in
anesthesia research and academic anesthesia. This recruitment is facilitated by our department's research
training continuum featuring both a formal residency research track and, later, comprehensive support in
transitioning to a junior faculty position. Once appointed, ReAP trainees select a primary research mentor and
a secondary mentor to monitor and facilitate their progress. Close interaction with mentors and other
accomplished faculty is essential to master critical skills that form the core of our training program. This is
supplemented by didactic material, and, in the case of clinical research, may be augmented further by a
master's degree in epidemiology or health science research. Administratively the program consists of a
Program Director, Steering Committee, External Advisory Committee and a group of 28 highly skilled and
successful training faculty from the anesthesia department and 9 other departments within the medical school.
There are already established interactions among many of the faculty members. The diverse faculty is divided
into three overarching areas: 1) Neuroscience, Pain and Analgesia, 2) Injury, Inflammation and Immunity, and
3) Outcomes Research, Economics and Bioinformatics. These divisions encompass research areas at the
forefront of our field. Our institutionally well-supported program and pipeline of highly qualified candidates will
easily support a total of four trainees with two appointed per year anticipating two-year training experiences for
most candidates."

 The leading cause of blindness in people over 50 in industrialized nations including the United
States is age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Early AMD is characterized by cholesterol
accumulation under the neurosensory retina called sub-retinal drusenoid deposits or under the retinal
pigment epithelium called drusen. Vision loss occurs in advanced AMD, with “wet” AMD comprising
20% of cases driven by angiogenesis, or from “dry” AMD (80% of cases) driven by cholesterol
accumulation and accompanying cell death (geographic atrophy). Mobius has an expert team in
cholesterol biology, lipid transport in the eye, lipoprotein nanoparticle (nanodisc) production, and
human therapeutics to tackle cholesterol removal from the eye. The Phase 1 goal is to demonstrate
the feasibility of optimized nanodisc technology to facilitate cholesterol removal, and demonstrate
therapeutic potential to treat cholesterol accumulation to treat dry AMD. The aims of Phase 1 will be
to initially design the optimal prototype nanodisc for cholesterol removal, and then test that prototype
in cells and pre-clinical models of relevance in AMD."
10823071,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Robust daily biological rhythms are key hallmarks of animal healthspan and are strongly
regulated by circadian clocks. These cell-autonomous molecular timers enable animals to adapt
to predictable daily changes in their environment. Clock-controlled outputs are all-encompassing
and clock disruption is associated with a wide range of pathologies and chronic diseases. In the
natural world, environmental signals, e.g. light and temperature, enable animal circadian clocks
to control timing of food intake. Nutrient influx can therefore provide metabolic signals to reinforce
environmental signals, promoting synchrony in cellular physiology to balance metabolism and
energy use. Efforts to understand the underpinnings of circadian clocks and their control over
daily biological rhythms have long focused on regulation at the transcriptional level, as core
oscillator proteins are transcription factors that govern rhythmic expression of genes involved in
diverse cellular processes. However, more recent studies have uncovered complementary non-
transcriptional mechanisms, including protein post-translational modifications (PTMs), that are
critical for maintaining robust daily rhythms. The overall goal of this project is to advance our
understanding of the role of nutrient-dependent PTMs in mediating metabolic regulation of time-
of-day-specific protein functions to orchestrate daily biological rhythms. We will use the diurnal
Drosophila model to test the central hypothesis that the timing and lipid content of metabolic
input from food intake and cellular metabolism regulate rhythmic S-palmitoylation of cellular
proteins, and S-palmitoylation is necessary for maintenance of robust daily biological rhythms. S-
palmitoylation is the only reversible lipid PTM; it is the attachment of palmitate, a saturated fatty
acid, to cysteines. S-palmitoylation targets a wide range of proteins from transcription factors to
membrane receptors, and is known to alter their stability, activity, localization, and protein-protein
interactions. The specific aims of this project are to investigate the mechanisms by which timing
of metabolic signals and clock-regulated lipid metabolism regulate S-palmitoylation rhythms and
how these rhythms are impacted by increased lipid content in food (Aim 1); to identify proteins
that exhibit daily rhythms in S-palmitoylation (Aim 2); and to determine if S-palmitoylation
regulates daily biology rhythms (Aim 3). This project will advance our long-term goal to integrate
post-translational regulatory pathways and obtain a comprehensive understanding of how daily
biological rhythms are regulated by diet, nutrition, and timing of metabolic input. This project will
have broad significance as misregulation in S-palmitoylation has been linked to a plethora of
human diseases including cancer, metabolic, neurological, and immunological disorders."

Despite major efforts by the research community, effective therapies for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related
dementias (ADRDs) remain elusive. This indicates that innovative approaches and therapeutic targets are
required. One such approach is to base therapeutic development on discoveries made in populations protected
from AD. Notably, centenarians, who are resilient to dementia despite advanced chronological age, are carriers
of genetic variants that attenuate signaling via the growth hormone/ insulin-like growth factor-1 (GH/IGF-1)
pathway. In fact, lower circulating IGF-1 levels are associated with preserved cognition in people with exceptional
longevity. Higher circulating IGF-1 levels, on the other hand, are related to greater hazard of developing AD and
ADRD, as demonstrated in a study from the UK Biobank and in patients with acromegaly. Furthermore,
attenuation of the GH/IGF-1 pathway results in delayed cognitive decline and enhanced memory in multiple aged
and AD rodent models. The pathogenesis of AD is multifactorial, while reduction in GH/IGF-1 signaling exhibits
pleiotropic effects; this may explain the effectiveness of reduced GH/IGF-1 in protecting from or delaying AD.
Attenuation of GH/IGF-1 signaling in rodent models reduces Aß plaque burden, neuroinflammation,
hyperphosphorylated tau, oxidative stress, vascular dysfunction, and metabolic dysfunction, while it upregulates
autophagy. Our group (InfinixBio) developed a novel GH receptor antagonist (NGHRA) that binds to peripheral
GH receptors (GHR) and prevents expression and secretion of circulating IGF-1. Reduction in circulating IGF-1
results in lower IGF-1 in the central nervous system because IGF-1 from circulation crosses the blood brain
barrier. The NGHRA is significantly superior to the existing FDA-approved GHRA, pegvisomant, that has been
effectively and safely used world-wide since 2003 for the treatment of acromegaly. Compared to pegvisomant,
the NGHRA has 10-30X greater affinity for the human GHR and is expected to have similar beneficial effects on
insulin sensitivity, slow clearance rate, and excellent safety profile that will make it amenable to chronic
subcutaneous administration in older adults to prevent or delay AD. In an effort to develop the NGHRA for clinical
use, we propose the following aims for this Phase I project. In Aim 1, we will optimize the production and
formulation of the NGHRA and produce gram quantities of the material to be used for the in vivo studies in Aims
2 and 3. In Aim 2, we will determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) properties of the
NGHRA and select the dose levels to be used for Aim 3. In Aim 3, we will establish the efficacy of the NGHRA
to achieve moderate or high in vivo PD responses via targeted, sustained reductions in IGF-1 levels in rodent
AD models. Achievement of Phase I milestones will pave the way for Phase II to study the efficacy of the NGHRA
in rodent AD models for prevention and/or delay of AD and ADRD. The NGHRA is expected to exhibit pleiotropic
effects against AD via a novel therapeutic target. Clinical experience with an existing GHRA has demonstrated
its safety. Thus, the development of the NGHRA could lead to its expedient testing in clinical trials."

The overall objective of this STTR Fast-Track project is to prepare and perform a Phase I clinical trial in metastatic
unresectable pancreatic ductal cancer adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients of a new immunotherapeutic approach
based on tetanus recall antigens delivered by bacteria (Listeria-Tetanus Toxoid) with Gemcitabine (GEM).
Background: PDAC has a five-year survival of less than 10% in the USA, i.e. standard of care GEM and Abraxane
or FOLFIRINOX (FOLinic acid, Fluorouracil, IRINothecan, OXaliplatin) only modestly improve survival. Dr.
Gravekamp’s research group (Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx) has developed a unique
immunotherapeutic approach that utilizes a safe non-pathogenic attenuated bacterium Listeria monocytogenes
to selectively infect tumors and metastases in vivo. We have shown that in mouse models Listeria delivers highly
immunogenic antigens, such as tetanus toxoid [TT]), to the immunosuppressed tumor microenvironment (TME),
where Listeria-TT spreads from tumor cell to tumor cell expressing TT. By contrast Listeria is quickly eliminated
from normal tissue and has few side effects. Paramount to this therapy, people have been vaccinated and
boosted against TT during childhood, and memory T cells to TT circulate in blood for life. Acting as a neoantigen
surrogate, Listeria-TT reactivates these memory T cells regardless of age, which subsequently kill the infected
tumor cells. To further improve T cell responses in the TME, we added a low dose of GEM to the therapy.
Preliminary data: This Listeria-TT+GEM combination regimen turned cold into immunologically hot tumors,
attracting CD4 T cells to the TME and producing high levels of perforin and granzyme B, two enzymes
responsible for killing tumor cells. We have shown in transgenic KPC mice that Listeria-TT+GEM is highly
effective against advanced pancreatic cancer (tumors and metastases were reduced by 80% and 87%,
respectively, with survival improved by 40% compared to untreated mice (see our recent paper in Sci Transl
Med, 2022). The main goal of this proposal is to bring the Listeria-TT+GEM treatment regimen to the clinic.
Bringing Listeria-TT+GEM to the clinic: Patents for the Listeria-TT recall antigen concept have been granted in
the US, China, Japan, and soon in Europe. All IP has been licensed by the Albert Einstein College of Medicine
to Loki Therapeutics to bring the therapy to the clinic. Loki has submitted a pre-IND application to test the Listeria-
TT+GEM in PDAC patients in a Phase 1 clinical trial, and a positive response has been received from the FDA.
Phase I
Aim 1: GMP manufacture of LM-TT+GEM for use in Phase 1 clinical trial (Months 1-12)
Aim 2: Establish pathology and toxicology profiles of LM-TT in mice (Months 1-12)
Aim 3: Submit an IND application and an IRB protocol (Months 1-12)
Phase II
Aim 4: Establish safety, toxicity and response profiles of LM-TT+GEM in PDAC patients (Months 13-36)"

Specific Aims: The overarching goal of this proposed study is to assess the factors associated with
monkeypox (MPOX) vaccination, testing, and stigma amongst men who have sex with men (MSM) in the
United States (US). Specially, we aim to 1. Evaluate determinants and disparities of MPOX vaccination
amongst MSM; 2. Characterize differences in MPOX testing uptake amongst MSM with MPOX-like symptoms;
3. Develop MPOX-specific stigma measures to evaluate the impacts of MPOX-related stigma amongst MSM.
Significance: Since May 2022, MPOX has been declared a public health emergency of international concern
with over 86,700 cases of MPOX in 110 countries/territories. Due to its widespread and rapid incidence, its
threat of endemicity or re-emerging outbreaks is significant. There is a growing but scarce body of literature
related to MPOX, with many unanswered questions related to disparities and determinants of vaccination,
testing, and stigma and how this will change in the coming years. Gay men have historically faced adverse
health effects compared to other reproductive aged adults, as witnessed in the global HIV/AIDS epidemic.
Furthermore, the emergence of COVID-19 has influenced accessibility of sexual health services and public
perception of infectious diseases, which could be leveraged to inform public health responses for MPOX and
future threats.
Approach: We will leverage data from approximately 10,000 MSM in the United States between 2022-2023
who participated in the American Men’s Internet Survey (AMIS). This proposed study is a rapid response to the
MPOX Epidemic using an innovative approach to understand trends and address unsolved questions in the
public health response. These data allow for assessment of higher level, contextual effects through developing
consistent metrics, to perform exploratory factor analysis and multilevel analysis of individual heterogeneity
and discriminatory accuracy (MAIHDA).
Training Information: Mr. Carpino’s training will consist of advanced infectious disease epidemiological
methodologies and social and behavioral factors. He will also incorporate contextual and structural level factors
and incorporate large data sources to apply analysis methods of observational data."
10799654,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a growing epidemic associated with multiple
comorbidities, including hypertension. In part because of its heterogeneity, clinical trials in HFpEF have been
largely disappointing to date, though the NHLBI-funded TOPCAT trial of spironolactone, a mineralocorticoid
receptor (MR) antagonist, had promising results. This has prompted several ongoing NIH and industry trials of
MR antagonists in HFpEF. However, the mechanisms through which MR antagonists may treat HFpEF remain
poorly understood. The MR is expressed in cardiomyocytes and vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells.
Activation of the MR at these sites causes inflammation, oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and fibrosis
– all pathways implicated in HFpEF. Primary aldosteronism (PA) is a cause of both hypertension and
disproportionate cardiovascular risk that is treated with MR antagonists, which target the underlying
pathophysiology: renin-independent production of aldosterone that chronically activates the MR. Though
considered rare, PA has recently been identified in up to 15-20% of apparently “essential” hypertension, with a
continuum of severity ranging from subclinical to overt, paralleling blood pressure and responsiveness to MR
antagonists: termed ‘subclinical PA.’ These data suggest an expanded role for MR antagonists as precision
therapy in the appropriate patients. Given its prevalence in hypertension, subclinical PA may be an
unrecognized mechanism of HFpEF pathogenesis and identify a patient subgroup best treated with MR
antagonists. The current proposal aims to evaluate the relationship between subclinical PA and HFpEF risk
and to probe the mechanism of risk using physiologic imaging techniques. Specific Aim 1 is to evaluate both
the cross-sectional relationship with cardiac structure and function and the longitudinal relationship between
subclinical PA and incident HFpEF in the NHLBI Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) cohort. Specific
Aim 2 leverages the mentors’ established Adrenal and Cardiac PET registries to investigate the relationship
between PA and myocardial flow reserve, a marker of vascular dysfunction and cardiovascular risk, by
evaluating the effect of an MR antagonist. This research will be accomplished within a comprehensive career
development plan designed to provide Dr. Brown with the skills to become an independent physician-scientist.
Her long-term career goal is be an independent, R01-funded physician-scientist focused on understanding the
underlying biological and hormonal mechanisms of heart failure risk, using physiologic imaging tools to identify
and characterize subclinical phenotypes that can be leveraged to enrich for responsive patient populations in
clinical trials, and ultimately to identify targets for heart failure prevention. An outstanding mentoring team and
advisory committee of established scientists in the fields of aldosterone and vascular biology, HFpEF, state-of-
the-art cardiovascular imaging, cardiovascular clinical trials, and epidemiological and biostatistical methods will
guide the candidate’s transition to scientific independence over the course of the award period."

Platinum-based chemotherapy regimens improve survival for patients with muscle-invasive (MIBC) and
metastatic bladder cancer (BC), and this approach remains the therapeutic cornerstone for this disease (and
many solid tumor types). While we and others have begun to understand how certain molecular processes in
MIBC tumors promote resistance, such as those involving DNA repair and immune microenvironmental
transcriptional reprogramming, the diversity of these interacting properties and their mechanistic underpinnings
are largely unknown. Our team’s advances in novel in vitro and in vivo bladder cancer model systems to enable
direct interrogation of candidate mechanisms, when paired with patient-centered single cell and spatial profiling
strategies (linked to advances in computational algorithms to dissect these data with tumor evolution principles),
provides the preliminary insights and motivation to guide this hypothesis-driven proposal. Our overarching
hypothesis is that distinct tumor and immune cellular programs cooperate to promote resistance to platinum
chemotherapy in MIBC, and we can uniquely investigate this hypothesis through the following Specific Aims: 1)
Define the influence of tumor-intrinsic cell cycle and DNA repair pathway alterations on platinum resistance in
MIBC; 2) Dissect the impact of platinum exposure on macrophage reprogramming in MIBC; 3) Investigate
mechanisms of tumor-macrophage crosstalk promoting platinum resistance in MIBC. For each of these Aims,
we will perform directed mechanistic experiments using relevant BC models, and pair our unique clinically
integrated patient cohort with integrative molecular analysis strategies (including whole genome, single cell, and
spatial strategies directly implicated by our molecular hypotheses). Taken together, this hypothesis-driven
proposal will define the relationship between specific tumor and immune cellular interactions in MIBC tumors
that promote platinum resistance using a novel suite of functional, computational, and cross-disciplinary
approaches. Broadly, this project will provide an integrative molecular, cellular, and experimental framework for
understanding clinically and biologically relevant molecular underpinnings of tumor immune interactions and
disease progression across tumor types."
10925376,"Abstract.
Secretion of saliva, a watery fluid containing ions and a host of protein constituents, is the primary function of the major
salivary glands. The importance of salivary fluid secretion is most palpable when it is reduced. Commonly, this occurs in
the autoimmune disease, Sjogren’s syndrome (SS). Notably in SS, a decrease in fluid flow occurs prior to any deleterious
morphological changes in the gland that occurs because of immune cell infiltration. Importantly, this indicates that early
in disease, defects in the stimulus-secretion coupling machinery occur prior to any gland destruction. A fundamental
understanding of the earliest alterations in signaling in SS are however lacking. To model early events in SS, we have used
a mouse model where the Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) pathway is activated. This ubiquitous pathway, known
to be activated in SS, is initiated by sensing cytoplasmic cyclic dinucleotides derived from DNA arising from virus,
mitochondria and dying cells to result in a type -1 interferon response and thus mirrors key features of SS disease.
Following parasympathetic nervous input, the appropriate stimulation of fluid secretion is absolutely dependent on the
proper localization and activation of the elements of the stimulus-secretion coupling machinery to distinct domains of the
polarized acinar cell. Our preliminary data show that fluid secretion is reduced ~50% following STING activation, but
paradoxically the peak acinar cell Ca2+ signal measured in vivo in an animal expressing a genetically encoded Ca2+ indicator
in acinar cells is markedly augmented. In addition, while stimulated Ca2+ signals are apically confined in physiological
situations, the spatial characteristics of the Ca2+ signal are disrupted in the model. We posit that disruption of the Ca2+
signal contributes to both the initial hypofunction and ultimately the progression of disease. The proposed studies will
investigate the mechanisms occurring at the onset of SS which result in hypofunction together with the pathways
associated with progression of disease. We will use complimentary, but independent approaches to address these goals.
In Specific aim 1, single cell RNA sequencing will be used to identify genes and target pathways in salivary gland cell
populations involved in the disruption of fluid flow and progression of disease and will inform all subsequent studies. We
will validate findings at the protein level and by functional assays. In tandem, we will explore promising candidates
involved in fluid secretion suggested by our preliminary functional data whose abundance, localization or activity is
disrupted in the SS disease models. Where possible targets and pathways will be validated in human tissues provided by
our collaborators at NIDCR. In specific aim 2, we will use in vivo imaging to define mechanisms which are involved in the
disruption of the Ca2+ signal in the disease models. We hypothesize that changes in Ca2+ sequestration together with Ca2+
release/influx mechanisms will be revealed. We hypothesize that the altered Ca2+ signals are a compensatory mechanism
in response to reduced secretion that are ultimately detrimental. Consistent with this idea, mitochondrial morphology is
severely disrupted in the disease model. In Specific aim 3, we will investigate how mitochondrial Ca2+ handling,
bioenergetics and reactive oxygen species production are altered in disease. In total our studies are designed to provide
insight in events occurring at the onset of SS which ultimately should provide targets for novel therapeutic intervention."

According to the EPA, indoor levels of pollutants are often 2-5 times and up to 100 times higher than
outdoor levels and people spend ~90% of their time indoors. The primary causes of poor indoor air quality
are pollution sources that emit irritating or dangerous gases and particles. The sources of indoor air pollution
can be fuel burning appliances, cooking and cigarette smoke, household cleaning items, and outgassing of
organics from building materials and furniture. Exposure of these indoor pollutants can result in
compromised health and occasionally even death.
In this Phase I SBIR project, TDA Research (TDA) will address this need by developing a high efficiency
adsorption system for removing contaminants/toxins commonly found in indoor air including HCN, NH3,
NO2, CO, and VOCs to sub ppb levels (well below the EPA permissible exposure level to comply with
WHO recommendations to reduce the incidence of cancer) to achieve risk based indoor air-standards. Our
system will feature a proprietary sorbent that offers superior adsorption capacities for common
contaminants such as VOCs (including formaldehyde and in particular chlorinated compounds), and NO2,
and with estimated lifetimes of 2-2.5 years, much greater than those offered by current devices that have
activated carbon filters that need to be changed every 3-12 months. Our system will also feature a long-
life ambient temperature catalyst that will be used to oxidize dangerous carbon monoxide into CO2 (a
feature currently not offered by current systems in the market)."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, has traditionally been defined by the
accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) in neuritic plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau in neurofibrillary tangles.
However, recent evidence indicates that AD is better viewed as a continuum of disease with a broader degree
of mechanistic and pathological heterogeneity. For example, ~15% of AD patients are negative for Aβ and most
AD patients have “mixed pathology”, with large subsets exhibiting accumulation of additional neurodegenerative
biomarkers such as α-synuclein (α-syn) and the TDP-43. Hippocampal and amygdalar deposits of TDP-43 have
recently been characterized as defining a disease state that overlaps heavily with AD: Limbic-predominant, Age-
related TDP-43 Encephalopathy (LATE). At present, AD diagnosis relies on clinical evaluation of symptoms and
PET imaging of Aβ and Tau load. However, this is costly, involves exposure to radiation, and does not have the
ability to detect broader dimensions of AD heterogeneity, such as the presence of pathological α-syn and TDP-
43 deposits that define large subsets of the AD continuum. There is an unmet medical need for an antemortem
diagnostic that can reliably identify mechanistic heterogeneity in individual AD patients, ideally one that can
detect multiple disease-related biomarkers simultaneously and non-invasively in CNS tissue. Amydis is
leveraging the retina as a “window to the brain” to address this unmet need by developing an ocular contrast
agent – i.e. a “retinal tracer – that can be used to fluorescently label α-syn, TDP-43, and Aβ in patients suspected
of having AD. The retinal tracer, AMDX-2011P, currently in human clinical trials, has these remarkable
capabilities and is designed to have fluorescent properties amenable for use with standard retinal imaging
equipment found in the eye care office, making this technology widely accessible. In this proposal, Amydis will
take the first clinical steps towards developing transformative new diagnostic technology in AD focusing on the
biomarker Aβ in AD patient retinas. The specific aims of the project are: (1) to develop a lyophilized product of
AMDX-2011P for i.v. delivery; (2) to complete a Phase 1B clinical trial of AMDX-2011P in patients with a clinical
diagnosis of FAD (known FAD mutation and dementia) who have a positive Aβ PET scan (N=12), subjects with
known FAD mutation but without clinical evidence of dementia (N=12) and healthy subjects (N=8) to determine
if the tracer reliably reports on Aβ status; and, (3) to begin constructing a database of AD and normal retinal
images for use in developing automated, AI-assisted retinal biomarker analytics tools for physicians and
researchers. Completion of these aims will advance the development of our in vivo ocular diagnostic test, getting
us one step closer to our mission of providing an antemortem, simple, and affordable diagnostic to parse the
heterogeneity of AD. Future studies will integrate knowledge obtained from ongoing clinical studies of AMDX-
2011P as a marker of a-syn and TDP-43 and assess whether the tracer can report on the co-occurrence and
variability of these critical biomarkers in individual patients."
10822508,"Immunotherapies (including CAR-T cell therapies) are wonder drugs when they work, but the
response rates of today’s immunotherapies are only 15-20% and therapy costs remain
prohibitively high for mass adoption. Single-cell sequencing (SC-seq) is becoming the preferred
tool for immune profiling to map a patient’s adaptive immune response, and to readout phenotypic
changes that result from CRISPR based gene edits at the single cell level. However, the full
potential of SC-seq based CRISPR screens and immune repertoire profiling for the development
of next generation therapeutics requires a 10-fold to 100-fold increase in cell throughput relative
to current platforms. Upcoming expiration of Illumina’s core IP re-ignited competition in US & EU
markets. The resulting re-acceleration in the drop of DNA sequencing costs (6-fold price reduction
in 2023 vs. Illumina’s 2022 pricing) makes SC-seq of 10 million cells affordable today (20-30
million cells in ~3 years and 100 million cells in 6 years), but existing methods for SC-seq do not
support throughput beyond 1 million cells per experiment. Proposed alternatives are scalable, but
trade-offs in performance and ease-of-use make them unsuitable for translational research.
Sansimeon’s approach uniquely scales SC-seq with throughput >100M cells, while retaining the
ease-of-use and necessary cell capture efficiency for high-throughput applications in translational
research. Our platform incorporates a technology for in-line sample debulking, which was
previously commercialized for applications in cell therapy manufacturing and rare cell isolation.
Sansimeon’s ability to sequence >100 million single cells directly from crude & complex samples
(such as whole blood or bone marrow aspirates), with a single-step automated workflow, makes
the platform ideally suited for high-throughput applications in translational research."
10828452,"This project describes the aims that will be addressed during the R00 phase in the Department of Pharmacology and Physiology at the University of Rochester. Currently available antidepressants have serious limitations for treating major depressive disorder (MDD), including low response rates, a significant number of treatment resistant patients, and a time-lag before there is a therapeutic response. Notably, ketamine, an NMDA receptor blocker, has demonstrated promise in clinical trials because of its rapid and sustained antidepressant effects. Although its mechanisms of action are still to be elucidated, our previous studies suggest that ketamine first inhibits cortical GABA interneurons, leading to disinhibition of excitatory pyramidal neurons, and subsequently, a glutamate burst, which results in synaptic plasticity and fast antidepressant responses. However, the effects of ketamine seem to be more complex than a simple enhancement of glutamatergic function, since MDD subjects and stressed animals show robust GABAergic deficits in cortical brain areas, which can be reversed by ketamine treatment. In addition, drugs that target the GABA system via α5-containing GABAA receptors (α5-GABAAR) have also been shown to produce fast and sustained behavioral effects in rodents. Therefore, the goal of this project is to extend our previous work and investigate how excitatory and inhibitory neuronal mechanisms interact to promote GABA-mediated plasticity that culminates in ketamine-induced behavioral responses, and explore additional GABAergic compounds relevant to MDD treatment, including α5-GABAAR modulators. The candidate will test the novel hypothesis that, in addition to glutamate-induced plasticity, increased GABA function in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), specifically through α5-GABAAR, is critical for the synaptic and behavioral effects of fast-acting antidepressants. This hypothesis will be investigated by integrating multiple levels of analysis, including pharmacological, molecular, genetic, behavioral and circuit-level approaches. The lab will address the following aims: 1) To investigate cellular and synaptic mechanisms involved in the behavioral actions of α5-GABAAR NAMs and PAMs and, 2) To investigate the role of α5GABAAR in mediating cell type-specific neuronal activity in the mPFC and associated behavioral outcomes. In addition to significant scientific advances in understanding the pathophysiology of depression, this project will guide efforts to develop a new generation of agents to treat MDD."

Excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) arising from endogenous sources and environmental exposures, such
as air pollution, chemicals and smoking, can cause oxidative stress, a detrimental condition linked to age-related
diseases and cancer in humans. Oxidative stress damages the entire cell, but is markedly harmful for DNA, with
the lesion 8-oxoguanine (8oxoG) being particularly prevalent. Cells adopt multiple mechanisms to maintain
homeostasis, including mutagenesis prevention and transcriptome reprogramming. Guanine-rich sequences are
enriched at telomeres and regulatory regions of the genome and are therefore, hot spots for 8oxoG formation.
Telomeres, the nucleoprotein caps which protect linear chromosomes, are transcribed into long non-coding
telomere repeat-containing RNAs (TERRA). 8oxoG formation and base excision repair processing at regulatory
sequences, have been implicated in gene expression regulation. However, elucidating the mechanisms of
transcriptional modulation by 8oxoG remains challenging, because oxidants used to induce oxidative stress
damage multiple cell components and generate diverse DNA adducts. Our group validated a fluorogen activating
peptide (FAP) system which produces singlet oxygen when bound to a photosensitizer dye and excited with far-
red light, converting guanine into 8oxoG. We report 8oxoG production at telomeres with high spatial and temporal
control by fusing the FAP with telomere protein TRF1. For this proposal, FAP has been adapted to target 8oxoG
to specific promoter sequences (dead Cas9-FAP) or genome-wide (H2B-FAP). The goal of this proposal is to
test the hypothesis that the processing of 8oxoG in G-rich genomic regions and promoters regulates
transcriptional responses to oxidative genotoxic damage. During the mentored K99 phase, Aim 1 will delineate
how 8oxoG damage at telomeres regulates the dynamics of TERRA transcription, stability and epigenetic
modifications, and how these changes affect telomere homeostasis. During this phase, I will take advantage of
resources at the University of Pittsburgh for professional development, to apply these skills through research,
data presentation, and writing opportunities. During the independent R00 phase, I will apply technical skills
obtained from additional training with key collaborators and models validated during the K99 phase to elucidate
how 8oxoG regulates transcription of specific oxidative stress-responsive genes at the endogenous loci in cells
(Aim 2, dCas-FAP). Also, during this phase I will extend these approaches genome-wide, employing RNA-seq,
OG-seq and ChIP-seq to elucidate the coupling between 8oxoG processing and gene expression in response to
singlet oxygen produced at chromatin (Aim 3, H2B-FAP). These experiments will provide me with the data
required for an early independent publication and preliminary data for research proposals. Importantly, during
the R00 phase I will develop independence from my mentor by focusing on the dynamic interplay between 8oxoG
repair and gene expression regulation."

The 2024 GRC on Biointerface Science will bring together a wide spectrum of researchers in the rapidly moving
field of biological interfaces, both natural and engineered. Biointerface Science encompasses the chemistry and
physics of cell-surface interactions and how to characterize and manipulate such interfaces. The study of
interfaces between biological systems and synthetic materials is central for a wide variety of areas that spans
from biosensors and separations, to tissue engineering, immunotherapy, and also in understanding fundamental
design principles in cell biology and biomedical engineering. Accordingly, the 2024 GRC on Biointerface Science
is well aligned with the mission of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB). During
the week, we will identify new scientific and technological developments associated with biointerfaces and
provide an open forum to discuss the best ways to tackle these emerging opportunities. The confluence of a
diverse group of attendees: scientists, engineers, and materials experts; students, post-docs, young
investigators, and thought-leaders; and underrepresented groups, should facilitate energetic and thought-
provoking discussions on the translation of biomolecular breakthroughs into real-world applications in medicine
and technology.
In the 2024 GRC, we will specifically address new emerging topics that will include: (1) DNA nanostructures at
biointerfaces; (2) mechanical signaling at interfaces; (3) nanoscale machines and robotics at biointerfaces; (4)
immune receptor signaling at engineered interfaces; (5) translational biointerfaces; and (6) emerging tools and
concepts in biointerfaces.
Each session of the GRC on Biointerface Science will be introduced by an expert Discussion Leader who will
provide a general overview to integrate the research communities and stimulate conceptual discussions.
Speakers with international recognition in the field will join young investigators and scientists gaining important
experience by attending this conference. Shorter talks will be selected from abstracts to highlight emerging
topics, especially from early-career researchers. Our goal is to offer a platform to evoke productive collaborations
and long-term partnerships. The associated Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) on Biointerface Science will
provide an intimate venue for junior investigators and young scientists to establish informal networks for long-
term collaborations and a lifetime of scientific citizenship. This provides an additional forum (Saturday before the
main meeting) for students to present orally, in addition to poster sessions and regular participation in the main
meeting."

The Institute for Health Promotion Research (IHPR) and the Mays Cancer Center, an NCI-designated cancer
center at UT Health San Antonio, partner closely to investigate causes of and solutions to the unequal impact
of cancer and chronic disease among Latinos in South Texas, the nation, and globally. Although there has
been substantial progress in cancer prevention, screening, diagnosis, and treatment over the past several
decades, progress has not kept pace among certain population regarding health disparities, such as
differences in access to care, less frequent use of proven screening tests, higher rates of advanced cancer
diagnoses and higher mortality rates. Latinos are among the groups with the highest rate of new cancer cases
in the United States.
In response to these disparities, the inaugural Advancing the Science of Cancer in Latinos (ASCL) conference
was held in 2018. Feedback from the inaugural and subsequent ASCL conferences (2018, 2020, and 2022)
has been very positive and researchers have appreciated the opportunity to engage with other researchers
interested in reducing Latino cancer health disparities. There is profound power when researchers understand
Latino cultural nuances and barriers, and come together to improve Latino health outcomes.
The 2024 ASCL conference will be hosted in San Antonio, Texas between February 21-23, 2024. The goal of
the conference is to convene researchers, physicians, healthcare professionals, patient advocates, students,
and community members to engage in open dialogue to summarize research advancements, identify gaps,
and develop actionable goals to translate research into clinical best practices, effective community
interventions, and professional training programs to eliminate cancer disparities in Latinos.
To achieve this the 2024 ASCL conference will support the following aims.
 1. Explore the intersection of health equity and biology on cancer control, prevention, and treatment.
 2. Promote collaborations among attendees to address cancer health disparities among Latinos."

This application is to advance a paradigm-shift in particulate guanylyl cyclase A receptor (pGC-A) and 3’, 5’ cyclic
guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) therapeutics with the development of a first-in-class small molecule targeting
the pGC-A/cGMP pathway for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Our CV focus is on the unmet clinical need for novel
therapeutic targets for hypertension (HTN), specifically resistant hypertension (RH), for which there are no
approved drugs. The applicants have advanced the concept that the heart is an endocrine organ, which
synthesizes ANP and BNP. Upon release, ANP and BNP bind to pGC-A , which is highly expressed in the heart,
kidney and vasculature, and generates its second messenger, cGMP. The significance of the pGC-A/cGMP
pathway in BP and CV homeostasis is supported by its biological actions which includes vasodilation, natriuresis,
diuresis, suppression of hypertrophy, fibrosis, apoptosis and inflammation as well as inhibition of aldosterone. As
RH patients are challenging to treat and have the highest risk adverse outcomes, the pleiotropic actions render
pGC-A as an novel molecular target for CV therapeutics. To date, there are no small molecule pGC-A stimulators
in existence. Through prior R01 funding, we discovered for the first time, pGC-A/cGMP small molecule scaffolds
which function as positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of which a potent derivative of our hit scaffold, MCUF-651,
was engineered. Preliminary studies revealed that MCUF-651: 1) potentiates ANP/pGC-A mediated cGMP
generation and reduces cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in vitro; 2) enhances ANP binding of pGC-A; 3) elevates cGMP
and lowers BP in spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHRs) and 4) is orally bioavailable. Herein, we propose to
advance our biological understanding of the cellular protective and BP lowering actions via small molecule pGC-A
positive allosteric modulation utilizing the prototype, MCUF-651 and to pursue a drug discovery strategy to identify
an optimized small molecule pGC-A PAM clinical candidate, building off MCUF-651. Aim 1: To define, in vitro,
MCUF-651's cellular protective effects on pGC-A/cGMP mediated suppression of apoptosis and proliferation in
human cardiorenal cells, inhibition of aldosterone in human adrenal cells, reduction in human coronary artery
endothelial cell permeability and vasorelaxation in arteries. Aim 2: To establish, in vivo, the chronic cardiorenal
protective, RAAS suppressing and BP lowering actions of orally administered MCUF-651 in SHRs. Aim 3: To
perform lead optimization of MCUF-651 to improve potency and pharmacological properties, using iterative cycles
of medicinal chemistry, selectivity profiling, functional potentiation and in vitro absorption, distribution, metabolism
and excretion studies. Aim 4: To evaluate metabolic liabilities of MCUF-651 and subsequently, to advance
prioritized optimized lead(s) to in vivo dose-dependent pharmacokinetic measurements and a chronic oral efficacy
study in SHRs and to declare a first-in-class small molecule pGC-A stimulator for IND-enabling studies."

Persons with HIV (PWH) living in the western world have a life expectancy near that of the general population,
but remain at a significantly elevated risk of developing cognitive impairments. Such impairments are the most
common neurological complication of HIV disease, and research targeting these comorbidities is one of four
overarching priorities identified by the Office of AIDS Research (NOT-OD-20-018). Substance use disorders
(SUD) are also more prevalent in PWH, yet their contribution to the increased rate of cognitive impairment in this
group remains poorly understood. A major barrier to progress has been the historic lack of diagnostic tests and
biomarkers that can precisely assess the neurological complications of HIV-infection, which has all but precluded
quantification of the additive impact of SUD comorbidity. This lack of tests and markers is at least partially
attributable to the field’s limited consensus on the key neuropathological features of HIV-infection. For example,
whether HIV-related cognitive decline is primarily attributable to cortical or subcortical circuits remains widely
debated, despite literally hundreds of neuroimaging studies over the past 20 years.
We recently received a NIH S10 High-End Instrumentation award from the Office of the Director to acquire a
next-generation magnetoencephalography (MEG) system. This $3M instrument was the third such unit installed
in the United States and remains the only one being used for HIV and/or SUD research. This award follows on
the heels of several remarkable discoveries in our ongoing effort to develop quantitative neuro-metrics that can
distinguish impaired from unimpaired PWH. Briefly, these findings revealed highly specific cortical oscillatory
deficits in PWH, which generated significant excitement and were published in a series of high-impact papers.
Most recently, we have shown that regular cannabis use is associated with a normalization of these oscillatory
deficits in PWH. While remarkable, all of this work was based on MEG measurements acquired with a previous
generation system (circa 2008), which was far more sensitive to cortical versus subcortical neural responses. Of
note, this greater sensitivity to cortical activity is true of many modern neuroimaging tools and consequently the
extensive evidence supporting cortical aberrations in virally suppressed PWH could be mistaken. Our new next-
generation MEG system provides an unprecedented opportunity to quantify human brain dynamics with
enhanced precision across multiple parameters, including far greater sensitivity to subcortical brain responses.
Thus, through this project we will determine whether HIV-related deficits in cortical oscillatory and spontaneous
activity are a primary or secondary neural abnormality in PWH, and whether the apparently beneficial effects of
cannabis use on neuronal dynamics in PWH are primarily attributable to modulation of cortical or subcortical
neurophysiological activity. While the pathological spontaneous and oscillatory neural activity observed in PWH
could arise from increased subcortical drive from the thalamus, we hypothesize that these cortical deficits will be
independent of any subcortical aberrations and that the beneficial effects of cannabis will be limited to the cortex."

As of March 25, the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected almost 125 million
individuals causing over 2.7 million deaths worldwide. Puerto Rico's population is at a heightened risk of COVID-
19 due to the existing health disparity in the population and its higher proportion of elderly people compared to
the US as a whole. There are now over 105,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, a substantial increase from the
64 infected cases reported just over year ago on March 22, 2020. It is expected that the cases will continue to
increase even though vaccines are provided by the local governor to slow the spread of the disease but only
about 10% of the population were fully vaccinated so far. This dire situation is coupled to the ongoing opioid
epidemic that parallels the current opioid injection incidence in the many other parts of the United States. It is
well established that people who inject drugs (PWID) are at high risk for infectious diseases, including HIV-1,
and now possibly COVID-19. These co-infected individuals are likely to have disease progression very different
from those who do not inject. It is known that HIV-1 infection is associated with lymphoid depletion in tissues
and induces systemic inflammation. The resulting inappropriate immune activation in PWID upon SARS-CoV-2
infection may enhance HIV-1 replication, lead to premature aging of T cells to promote HIV-1 disease
progression, and likely potentiate the effects of inflammation and disease course due to COVID-19. The
proposed study will make use of a well-established cohort of injection drug users in Puerto Rico, where there is
a historically high level of injection drug use and an HIV incidence rate that is disproportionately associated with
drug use. The overall objective of our proposed supplement study is to expand and leverage our current longitudinal
study on PWID with and without HIV-1, to determine the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and its HIV-1 viral load,
inflammation, disease progression due to both COVID-19 and HIV-1 infections. The current ongoing longitudinal cohort
study of PWID in Puerto Rico will allow our team to test the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 infection of HIV+
PWID intensifies inflammation that, in turn, exacerbates HIV replication, disease progression and HIV treatment
failures. This hypothesis will be tested via three specific aims: Aim 1, Expand our current cohort study of HIV-1
infected PWID, with a non-PWID HIV uninfected control group to support a prospective evaluation of the
incidence and the effects of COVID-19 at baseline and at follow-ups. Aim 2, Quantify the SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-
1 viral loads, cellular immune-phenotypes and inflammatory mediators in blood samples, and microbial
dysbiosis at baseline and longitudinally followed these cases for HIV disease progression. Aim 3, Correlate the
effects of COVID-19 on the HIV-1 viral loads, cellular immunophenotypes, inflammatory mediators and
neurocognitive functions, as well as disease progression, while controlling for HIV and injection drug use status
and socio-behavioral factors associated with drug use. The results is translatable to other states in the U.S. and
may lead to the development of strategies to prevent HIV and COVID-19 disease progression in HIV+ PWID."

Benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS) is the most common focal childhood epilepsy syndrome,
characterized by a transient period of seizures and abundant epileptiform spikes arising from the sensorimotor
cortex during non-REM (NREM) sleep. Recent findings indicate that BECTS is a developmental disorder with a
wider range of severity than previously appreciated. In addition to seizures, children have deficits in attention
and motor coordination. The motor and cognitive symptoms in BECTS exist on a spectrum of severity, clinically
and genetically overlapping with severe epileptic encephalopathies, which are characterized by permanent and
progressive declines in cerebral function coincident with sleep activated spikes. There are currently no proven
treatment strategies to address the neuropsychological deficits in BECTS or other epileptic encephalopathies.
Several lines of evidence, including our preliminary findings, suggest a dysfunction in thalamocortical circuitry
drives the motor and cognitive abnormalities in BECTS. First, thalamocortical structural circuits are abnormal in
BECTS. Second, children with BECTS have reduced sleep spindles, oscillations that are critical for memory
consolidation during NREM sleep and generated and propagated by thalamocortical circuitry. Third,
thalamocortical sensory gating is impaired in children with centrotemporal spikes, like those observed in
BECTS. Effective dampening or “gating” of irrelevant sensory information prior to reaching the cortex, mediates
performance on attentional tasks. Despite this evidence, the relationship between thalamocortical
electrophysiology, connectivity, and cognitive symptoms in BECTS has not been investigated. The long term
goal of this project is to test the hypothesis that focal thalamocortical circuit dysfunction mediates the
motor and cognitive symptoms in BECTS. Our interdisciplinary team - consisting of a pediatric
epileptologist, a neuropsychologist, and a computational neuroscientist – will use validated experimental
paradigms and computational tools to collect and analyze multimodal data to link thalamocortical circuit
abnormalities to cognitive deficits in children with BECTS. First, we will determine whether children with
BECTS show abnormal sleep spindle activity that relates to impaired sleep-dependent memory consolidation.
Second, we will determine whether impaired sensory gating and thalamocortical connectivity relate to impaired
attention in BECTS. Third, we will test the impact of medication and closed loop auditory stimulation on
thalamocortical spindles, gating, and cognitive function in BECTS. Completion of the proposal goals will
represent significant progress towards understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying cognitive
dysfunction in BECTS, and the identification of new targets and approaches for treating cognitive deficits in
BECTS and related epileptic encephalopathies.

Skeletal muscle weakness is a hallmark of aging and cancer cachexia that significantly affect individual
healthspans and quality of life. Despite the clinical significance, no pharmacological therapies are currently
available to mitigate muscle atrophy and weakness. The goal of this project is to test the ability of a novel and
promising pharmacological intervention, unacylated ghrelin, to delay skeletal muscle weakness and loss
of muscle mass in aging and in cancer cachexia. Ghrelin is a hormone that increases appetite when the
acylated ghrelin (AG) binds to its receptor in the brain, growth hormone secretagogue receptor-1a (GHSR1a).
An acute rise in AG increases lean mass in wasting conditions, but a concurrent increase in adiposity and
decreased sensitivity in GHSR1a receptor lead to atrophy and contractile dysfunction. In contrast, recent studies
show a direct beneficial effect of the unacylated form of ghrelin (UnAG) on muscle, independent of GHSR1a
activation. Incubating myoblast with UnAG increases differentiation and fusion into myotubes, and inhibited
glucocorticoid-induced muscle atrophy and proteolytic markers. During a 2-day fasting and 14-day denervation,
a chronic increase in circulating UnAG using a genetic modification prevented skeletal muscle atrophy
independent of activation of the growth hormone/IGF-1 axis via GHSR1a. The goal of this proposal is to test the
ability of UnAG to mitigate loss of muscle mass and weakness in two distinct degenerative conditions-sarcopenia
and cancer cachexia. The following aims are proposed: Aim 1: To determine whether UnAG prevents neurogenic
atrophy with aging by altering rates of protein synthesis and degradation in muscle. Aim 2: To determine whether
UnAG prevents contractile dysfunction with aging through modulations of calcium handling and sensitivity. Aim
3: To determine whether UnAG prevents a rapid wasting and contractile dysfunction in cancer cachexia. In order
to understand the molecular mechanisms of UnAG on skeletal muscle cells, I will learn and perform state-of-the-
art molecular biology and integrative physiology techniques to assess in vivo protein turnover rate and calcium
handling and sensitivity of myofilaments (intracellular calcium transient and uptake). If my results support the
hypothesis, clinical trials may be warranted. UnAG and its synthetic peptides have excellent safety profiles in
humans and animals with null association to cancer cell growth.
 The principal investigator (PI) of this grant is a postdoctoral fellow under the mentorship of Dr. Van Remmen
at Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation. The PI will learn state-of-the-art molecular biology and integrative
physiology techniques from his co-mentors Drs. Benjamin Miller and Susan Brooks, respectively. These
techniques will be critical in the PI’s independent laboratory and boost his scientific career. The PI’s primary
mentor, Dr. Holly Van Remmen, will train him the expertise in redox biology and share her experience and
success in aging research. Dr. Van Remmen will monitor overall progress of the project and the PI’s career
development during the mentored phase and ensure his secure transition toward independence."

 Despite the efficacy of psychotherapies, ~90% of people with alcohol use disorder (AUD) do not
receive treatment for this chronic condition and there are notable disparities in care. Access to and involvement
in efficacious AUD care is even lower for women, Black/African American individuals, and people from other
under-represented groups. Novel virtual care approaches (telephone, video, portal therapies) conceptually
rooted in efficacious therapies [e.g., motivational interviewing (MI), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)] and
theory can potentially improve treatment accessibility and appeal and reduce stigma. Virtual approaches have
had limited use in AUD care, recently increasing in COVID-19 to provide ongoing care (telephone/video
therapy) for current patients in specialty clinics, while treatment initiation remains low. There is an untapped
potential for virtual approaches to engage individuals across health systems, who otherwise do not receive
treatment, but could benefit. Virtual strategies, including telephone and video sessions and patient portals, are
promising for reaching and engaging substance-using populations, including under-represented individuals,
within health systems. Using a portal messaging system and phone calls to virtually engage patients in AUD
treatment outside of clinics and in their preferred locations is an innovative treatment model that can potentially
be implemented in health systems, but must be tested to inform broader dissemination.
 We will use a sequential, multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) to identify critical adaptive
intervention (AI) strategies for a virtually-delivered AUD engagement and care model. Adults with AUD (50%
women, 25% Black/African American, 5% Latinx) will be randomized to a 1st stage strategy for drinking
reduction and AUD care engagement integrating referral for AUD care: 1) a single telephone MI session (T-
engage), or 2) 4-weeks of a MI-focused portal messaging (P-engage). At 4 weeks, non-responders will be
randomized to a 2nd stage strategy: 1) step up to a video 8-session MI-CBT for AUD (phone delivery as
needed), or 2) continued 1st stage (i.e., 4 weeks of P-engage with greater depth, a second T-engage session
building on the first). Outcomes will be assessed at 4-, 8-, and 12-months. Aim 1 will compare 1st-stage
strategies (T-engage vs. P-engage) on alcohol outcomes and AUD treatment utilization. In Aim 2, among 1st-
stage non-responders, we will identify the most efficacious 2nd-stage strategy. Aim 3 includes an
implementation planning phase, with cost measures, and key stakeholder interviews and qualitative analysis of
barriers and facilitators to implementation and adoption of a virtual care model. Secondary aims include:
examining the moderating effects of race/ethnicity and sex on outcomes given our enriched sample and
examining the best sequence of AIs. Our proposed project will have high public health impact by evaluating a
novel virtual care model focused on increasing both treatment engagement and delivery that can be integrated
in health systems to increase AUD treatment appeal and accessibility and help address treatment disparities."
10791807,"Girls and women are understudied in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) research because study samples often
reflect the male predominance in ASD prevalence, with 3-4 boys diagnosed for every girl. Longitudinal imaging
studies with sufficient numbers of females are completely lacking. To address this important gap in knowledge,
we aim to evaluate brain and behavioral trajectories from early to middle childhood in a large, longitudinal
cohort of nearly 100 girls with autism. As the field moves towards identifying neural biomarkers for ASD risk
and predicting outcomes, it is critical to understand similarities and differences between males and females
with ASD across the lifespan. Another serious need is to better understand co-occurring psychiatric conditions
in females with ASD. It is well-recognized that individuals with autism have high rates of co-occurring
psychopathology, but little is known about early behavioral and neural risk factors that may be specific to girls.
As in so many other areas of medicine, the optimal treatment of girls and women with ASD will only emerge
when sex-related autism attributes and problems are adequately understood. In 2014, we established the Girls
with Autism – Neuroimaging of Development (GAIN) study, which increased representation of females with
ASD in a larger ongoing project called the Autism Phenome Project and followed a cohort of girls across three
time points from 2-6 years of age. With this application, we plan to conduct a fourth longitudinal time point in
GAIN participants during middle childhood (9-12 years of age). In addition, in order to increase generalizability
of findings, we plan to enroll new girls into the study with a focus on racial and ethnic minority groups that have
historically been under-represented. Newly enrolled girls will follow the same study protocols established by
the GAIN study and data will be combined. We propose the following aims: 1) To identify sex-specific neural
and behavioral patterns in girls with ASD in early and middle childhood. 2) To identify sex differences in neural
risk factors associated with symptoms of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology in middle childhood.
3) To characterize the emergence and impact of symptoms of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in
girls with ASD. Evaluating females with ASD is a cross-cutting goal that spans all objectives of the US
Department of Health & Human Services Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee and is also consistent
with the goals of the Trans-NIH Strategic Plan for Women’s Health Research."
10791809,"ABSTRACT
Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, fatal disease of aging with limited therapeutic options. Despite
IPF lungs feature vascular abnormalities, including capillary rarefaction and vascular leak, the impact of vascular
endothelial dysfunction in the progression of this disease has remained unexplored. This proposal is designed
to fill this knowledge gap. Multi-omics analysis of endothelial cells (ECs) from young and aged mouse lungs
performed in our laboratory implicated the transcription factor ERG as an orchestrator of pulmonary vascular
repair and inflammation, whose homeostatic function is impaired during fibrosis with aging. Genetic ablation of
endothelial ERG in young mice led to increased inflammation, vascular rarefaction, and perpetuated lung fibrosis
following bleomycin challenge mirroring the aged lung phenotype. ERG silencing in human lung ECs in vitro led
to the increased secretion of fibrogenic mediators that promoted IPF-derived lung fibroblast activation. Whole
lung scRNA-seq combined with FACS analysis revealed reduced number of lung progenitor ECs, known as
general capillary (gCap) ECs, in ERG deficient mice compared to WT mice; this alteration was also observed in
lungs derived from IPF patients. Pharmacologic inhibition of the enhancer-binding protein and epigenetic
regulator BRD4 reversed inflammatory responses in ERG-silenced human lung ECs in vitro and restored gCap
EC identity in IPF lung explants ex vivo. Moreover, IPF and bleomycin-induced mouse lung fibrosis were
associated with overexpression of genes that regulate necroptosis, a form of programmed inflammatory cell
death implicated in aging and fibrosis. In addition, inhibition of necroptosis with the specific inhibitor Necrostatin-
1
attenuated inflammation induced by ERG silencing in human lung ECs. Based on these findings we
hypothesize that aging-associated epigenetic remodeling impairs ERG transcription in injured lung gCap ECs
leading to dysregulated inflammation, capillary rarefaction, and persistent lung fibrosis.
Aim 1 of this proposal
will characterize the influence of ERG on lung gCap EC regeneration and fibrosis. Aim 2 will define the role of
epigenetic mechanisms in lung endothelial ERG chromatin interaction, transcription, and vascular aging. Aim 3
will establish the contribution of endothelial necroptosis to lung vascular abnormalities and fibrosis in aged mice
with compromised ERG functions. We will test our hypothesis using in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo models including
an organotypic model of human IPF. gCap-enriched ECs and fibroblasts will be isolated from human IPF lungs.
Endothelial fibrogenic activity will be evaluated in an endothelial-fibroblast co-culture systems. Conditional
knockout and lineage tracing approaches will be used to investigate the role of ERG in endothelial homeostasis
and lung fibrosis. Fibrosis, vascular leak, capillary rarefaction, and hypoxia will be evaluated with molecular,
biochemical, and histological methods. Additional methods include immunohistochemistry, ChIP-seq analysis,
and pharmacologic inhibition of selected targets. This proposal will define endothelial alterations that are critical
in the progression of lung fibrosis toward our long-term goal of identifying novel targets for the treatment of IPF."

Genetic data have the potential to improve the care of patients with the common colorectal disease
diverticulitis. Every year over 200,000 people are hospitalized with diverticulitis in the United States. Attacks of
diverticulitis are characterized by abdominal pain, fevers, chills, and gastrointestinal distress. For most
patients, attacks are mild and self-limited, but 10-35% go on to suffer severe disease: multiple hospitalizations,
colon perforation, and abdominal sepsis. Tens of thousands of patients undergo major surgery every year to
prevent severe disease. Currently, however, surgeons have no ability to predict which patients will have severe
disease. There is an unmet clinical need for improved understanding of the disease and risk stratification.
Historically, diverticulitis was considered an environmental disease related to diet, but data show clear
evidence of heritability; 40-53% of individual risk of diverticulitis is due to genetics. My preliminary work
described the genomic architecture of diverticulitis and identified 42 genetic loci associated with the disease.
This proposal builds on that preliminary work to further investigate the genetic contribution to diverticular
disease. My central hypothesis is that genetic risk factors can predict severity of diverticulitis, interact with
modifiable risk factors – such as visceral adiposity, and may manifest themselves as diverticulitis or as other
clinically-associated connective tissue traits including hernia, prolapse, and aneurysm.
The overall goal of this application is to support my training and development as an independent investigator in
genomic epidemiology. The career development plan includes completion of a master’s degree in
bioinformatics, structured mentorship, and enhancement of skills through performance of research. My main
research goal is to determine how a patient’s genetic background influences the development and course of
diverticular disease. The major themes of this project are reflect in the Specific Aims: 1) Generate and validate
a polygenic risk score for severe diverticulitis using four large biobanks, 2) Incorporate polygenic and
morphometric data to improve diverticulitis risk stratification by assessing the interaction of visceral adiposity
and genetic risk, 3) Investigate a common genetic causality for diverticular disease as a composite connective
tissue degenerative trait, examining an underlying genetic basis for phenotypes clinically linked to diverticulitis.
Successful completion of these studies will enhance our understanding of the role of genetics in diverticulitis,
lead to further large scale prospective research, and translate into meaningful genomic tools for patients with
diverticulitis."

10789290,"Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), a disease with no available treatments, is a prevalent Alzheimer’s
disease related disorder (ADRD), occurring as a comorbidity in > 80% of Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
cases, but also sporadically in > 50% of people over the age of 80 years. Arising from fibrillar amyloid
β (Aβ) deposition in cortical arteries and arterioles and brain capillaries, CAA is marked clinically by
cerebral infarction, microbleeds and intracerebral hemorrhages (ICH), pronounced perivascular
neuroinflammation, and is a prominent contributor to vascular cognitive impairment and dementia. CAA
severity strongly correlates with cognitive decline in sporadic CAA and AD. Despite the severe clinical
burden, mechanisms linking vascular Aβ deposition to microthrombus, vascular damage, and
inflammation are poorly understood, and there are no available treatments for CAA. Investigation
of these mechanisms in reliable animal models is critical, and the rTg-DI rat, that faithfully recapitulates
human CAA pathologies, including progressive vascular Aβ deposition, pronounced perivascular
neuroinflammation, and thrombotic events/microbleeds, is such a model. Neutrophil mediated
inflammatory mechanisms, such as neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have been reported in
cardiovascular disease, and various chronic inflammatory disorders, including AD patient brains. NET
formation often leads to thrombin generation, thrombotic events, and vascular damage like that seen
in CAA and may be an important component of Aβ related vascular damage and neuroinflammation.
Recently we demonstrated the presence of NET markers in brain regions containing microhemorrhages
and thrombotic events in the rTg-DI rat model of CAA and defined a proteomic signature of NET
formation in early and late disease stages. Based on this strong evidence, our central hypothesis is
that NETs are directly induced by vascular Aβ fibril deposits and NETs forming either
luminally or abluminally may contribute to vascular degeneration prior to microbleed
occurrence in CAA. Here we will investigate CAA-specific fibrillar Aβ’s ability to induce NET formation
in-vitro, including NET visualization, quantitation, and molecular characterization by proteomic and
transcriptomic analysis. We will also chronologize neutrophil and NET involvement in CAA progression
by investigation of neutrophil and NET presence in cerebral blood vessels and surrounding tissue, in
early and late disease stages, using cerebral vessel and brain regional isolation, proteomics and
targeted transcriptomics, and immunohistological approaches. This study will provide important insight
to currently unknown mechanisms of CAA progression and investigate the potential of finding targets
within the NET pathway for therapeutic intervention in CAA."
10792599,"Endocannabinoids (EDCs) and the innate immune system are two early signaling systems which independently and together profoundly influence brain development. Critical windows of development are also often sensitive periods for disruption by exogenous stimuli. We have discovered a unique critical period in the neonatal amygdala of the rat during which the innate immune cells of the brain, microglia, actively engulf and kill newborn cells that if left unmolested would have gone on to become astrocytes. Through this mechanism the future density of astrocytes in the amygdala is determined. Most remarkably, the optimal density is lower for males than females in that it is causally responsible for increased neuronal activity many weeks later during epochs of adolescent social play. Equally remarkable, the increased phagocytic activity of microglia in the male amygdala is a direct consequence of a higher EDC tone, which is in turn developmentally programmed by elevated androgens in neonatal males. Changes to either androgen levels or, more importantly, EDC tone, including by exposure to THC, during the critical period permanently alters the neuronal/astrocytic population and playfulness during adolescence. Marijuana use during pregnancy and breastfeeding is prevalent and increasing due to legalization, decriminalization and medicalization but we are largely ignorant of the potential consequences to the fetal and newborn brain. Advances in transcriptomics and adeno-associated virus (AAV) techniques provide new tools for exploration and precision not previously accessible for the rat. A primary goal is a deep mechanistic understanding of endocannabinoid-induced microglia phagocytosis of astrocytic progenitors to illuminate with unprecedented specificity the interaction between immune, neuronal, astrocytic and progenitor cells. An additional goal is to establish a larger framework for understanding development THC exposure that converges on inhibitory neurons in brain regions regulating sex-typic social behaviors. We will achieve these dual ends via the following Specific Aims. Aim 1 will fully characterize the endocannabinoid and innate immune systems of the developing amygdala by high precision cell phenotyping, identification of the source of complement proteins needed for phagocytosis, and transcriptomics to identify genes mediating cell survival. In Aim 2 we will selectively reduce androgen receptor in one cell type at a time to determine the source of the sex difference in endocannabinoid tone and Aim 3 will interrogate the relationship between the effects of THC, EDCs and androgen action with an emphasis on inhibitory neurons across brain regions. Combined, these studies will provide unprecedented clarity in the cellular participants and mechanisms establishing a sex difference in a social circuit and how that process can go awry as a consequence of developmental THC exposure."
10792604,"This application for an NHLBI R35 Outstanding Investigator Award is to explore the role of the plasma protein
von Willebrand factor (VWF) in 2 diseases, type 2 von Willebrand disease (VWD) and sickle cell disease (SCD),
and our goal is to roll 2 R01 grants covering these areas into a single, more cohesive grant with more flexibility
to follow interesting scientific leads. In these two diseases, the involvement of VWF is in opposite directions,
dysfunctional and with predominantly small multimers in type 2 VWD, and abundant, hyperfunctional, and
large in sickle cell disease. For VWD, we will explore the molecular basis of the broad phenotypic variability
associated with single mutations, testing the hypothesis that important determinants of this variability include
percentage of mutant monomer incorporation into multimeric VWF and extent of VWF proteolysis by the met-
alloprotease ADAMTS13. We will also explore how platelet contractility is affected in type 2 VWD, including
to determine the respective contributions of plasma and platelet VWF. Finally, we will examine the intriguing
possibility that in types 2A and 2B VWD a significant contribution to the hemostatic defect is provided by
VWF fragments produced by excessive VWF proteolysis. In SCD, we have evidence of defective regulation of
the largest VWF multimers, which are inadequately cleaved by ADAMTS13. We will investigate the basis of
this lesion, and test whether a variety of measures aimed at attenuating the activity of VWF will improve the
course of the disease in an animal model of SCD. Finally, we will explore the molecular basis of a fascinating
observation we made in the course of studying the effect of N-acetylcysteine in SCD: that the drug induced
rapid loss of very dense erythrocytes from the blood of patients. We hypothesize that the effect is caused by
reduction of oxidized spectrin residues and will also explore the possibility that it may be treated even more
effectively by the amino acid L-ergothioneine, which is present in mushrooms and other foods and is concen-
trated in erythrocytes by a highly specific transporter. Together, these studies use state-of-the-art tools to ex-
plore perplexing problems in two important human diseases, with the expectation of improved therapies for
the affected patients. The R35 funding mechanism provides the flexibility to follow interesting leads discov-
ered during the course of these studies, increasing the likelihood that patients will benefit."
10792606,"Abstract
The primary cilium is a microtubule-based dynamic cellular appendage that is found in many cell types. Cilia
transduce cellular responses to extracellular signals, particularly to the morphogen hedgehog in vertebrates
during differentiation and proliferation, regulating morphogenesis in multiple tissues. However, the mechanisms
by which cilia-specific signals are maintained and propagated to direct downstream pathways during
morphogenesis is not well understood. Understanding signaling at cilia requires mechanistic understanding of
trafficking to cilia, isolating ciliary from extraciliary functions of signaling molecules, and studying functional
consequences directly in tissues without disrupting cilia. My group is one of the foremost in studying cilia-specific
signaling from subcellular to organismal scales, while preserving ciliary morphology. We identified the ciliary
trafficking adapter Tulp3 and key repressors of hedgehog pathway, Gpr161 and Ankmy2, both of which function
via cAMP signaling regulated by cilia. We postulate that the inherent complexity of ciliary signaling can be
understood by examining how signals are maintained in and propagated uniquely by cilia (compartmentalization)
and how cilia direct positive and negative regulation in downstream pathways (counterregulatory signaling). Over
the next five years, we will directly study how compartmentalization and counterregulatory signaling at cilia
regulates morphogenesis in different tissues. By leveraging our expertise in ciliary trafficking and hedgehog
pathway repression, and by using innovative mouse models, we will study the effect of ciliary signaling in the
following contexts. First, we will determine how counterregulatory signaling in cilia regulates renal tubular
homeostasis. We hypothesize that Tulp3 cargoes function as cystogenic ciliary signals that are normally inhibited
by polycystins. We propose to identify cystogenic drivers in cilia by identifying and perturbing cargoes of Tulp3
in preventing cysts. Second, we will determine the role of ciliary cAMP signaling in neural tube patterning and
closure. We hypothesize that hedgehog pathway repression by cAMP-protein kinase A signaling at cilia regulates
neural tube closure. We will determine role of adenylyl cyclase and protein kinase A compartmentalization in the
cilium-centrosomal complex in regulating hedgehog signaling strength, neural tube patterning, and closure.
Third, we will determine how cilia regulated repression of hedgehog pathway affects tissue morphogenesis. We
will test ciliary contributions to repression thresholds required for specific morpho-phenotypic outcomes by
perturbing ciliary compartmentalization of Gpr161 and adenylyl cyclases. Through this research we will identify
the features and consequences distinctive to signaling by cilia in directing tissue emergent properties. Our work
is cross-disciplinary and is supported by collaborators with expertise in proteomics, nephrology, neuropathology,
human genetics and embryology. Our research will expose new entry points for understanding complex
ciliopathy phenotypes and define translational opportunities for treating diseases caused by ciliary dysfunction."
10792607,"ABSTRACT
Prions are infectious, self-propagating protein aggregates that were first described in the context of the
transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), a group of fatal neurodegenerative diseases that afflict
humans and other mammals. The culprit in the case of the TSEs is an endogenous protein called PrP that has
an inherent ability to undergo a dramatic conformational conversion, leading to the formation of distinctive
cross-b aggregates (termed amyloid) that are both self-templating and infectious. Prions have also been
uncovered in budding yeast and other fungi, where they act as protein-based genetic elements that confer new
heritable phenotypes on those cells that harbor them. Like PrP, fungal prion proteins can access alternative
conformational states, a soluble form and a self-perpetuating, amyloid form (the prion form) that is infectious.
Unlike PrP-based prions, however, fungal prions do not typically cause cell death; they can, in fact, enhance
cell survival under specific stress conditions. The foundation for the proposed studies is our discovery that
prion proteins also exist in bacteria. Our research goals are to investigate the scope of prion-like phenomena in
bacteria and to probe the physiologic significance of prions in bacteria. An overarching hypothesis informing
our work is that protein-based heredity can serve as an epigenetic source of phenotypic diversity in the
bacterial domain of life. As well as using E. coli cells as a model in which to study prion proteins from diverse
bacteria, we are extending our studies to encompass species that naturally contain prion proteins, including
constituents of the human microbiota. A major methodological focus of our long-term research program has
been the development of broadly applicable genetic assays, and our work here includes the development and
implementation of bacteria-based genetic assays that can detect prion conversion events. These genetic tools
will enable screening for prion protein encoded in bacterial (and other) genomes, facilitating the discovery of
new prion proteins and potentially also new classes of prion proteins. At the same time, our tools provide facile
methods for addressing mechanistic questions about prion formation and prion propagation. Our approach to
understanding prion biology is multi-faceted, encompassing ongoing collaboration with structural biologists and
biophysicists. Because prion proteins in all domains of life share fundamental properties, what we learn in
bacteria could provide mechanistic insight relevant to prion proteins in other settings; furthermore, our bacteria-
based tools can be used to investigate the behavior of bacterial and non-bacterial prion proteins alike.
Bacterial prions could have far-reaching human health implications; for example, as a source of non-genetic
phenotypic heterogeneity, prions might enhance bacterial fitness in a pathogenic context. Moreover, the
presence of prions in the human microbiota could potentially impact human health via cross-Kingdom
templating interactions involving disease-associated human proteins."

The broad long term objective is to improve methods of disease treatment in the liver. Hepatic fibrosis is a
major cause of morbidity and mortality that affects millions of people world-wide and is usually a feature of
chronic liver disease such as that caused by excessive alcohol consumption. In the United States, alcoholic
liver disease (ALD) is a leading cause of GI-related deaths, with about half of the 75,000 liver disease deaths
each year being related to alcohol use. A major limitation is the lack of approved therapeutics for treating either
liver fibrosis or ALD. However, a new lead has emerged from our studies of exosomes that are produced by
hepatocytes. Our overall objective is to establish therapeutic uses of exosomes for treating liver disease. Our
Preliminary Data show that hepatocyte exosomes: (i) attenuate expression of genes that regulate fibrogenesis
or activation in cultured primary hepatic stellate cells (HSC); (ii) suppress fibrogenic pathways and reverse
hepatic fibrosis in vivo; (iii) attenuate damage in cultured hepatocytes exposed to ethanol or CCl4, (vi) contain
relatively high levels of miR-532-5p or miR-214 that likely contribute, in part, to their therapeutic actions in
fibrosis or ALD respectively especially as their respective tissue levels in the liver are individually suppressed
during chronic injury; and (v) bind to target hepatocytes or HSC via cell-surface integrin αvβ3 and α5β1. Our
central hypothesis is that miR-532-5p-/miR-214 or specific integrin ligands contribute to, respectively, the
therapeutic actions or cellular binding of hepatocyte exosomes. The Specific Aims to test this hypothesis are:
Aim 1 - Identify miR-532-5p as a therapeutic component of hepatocyte exosomes that modulates
SMAD3 in hepatocytes or HSC by using purified exosomes or cell co-culture assays, employing SMAD3 3’-
UTR reporters, CTGF promoter reporters, expression of SMAD3 downstream targets, siRNA-mediated SMAD3
knockdown, and miR-532-5p over-expression or antagonism to show direct functional regulation of SMAD3 in
each target cell; Aim 2 - Determine the role of hepatocyte exosomes and of exosomal miR-214 or miR-
532 in attenuating ethanol-induced liver injury by demonstrating the therapeutic effect of exosomes in
ethanol diet models in vivo, on ethanol/TNFα- or LPS-mediated pathways in hepatocytes or Kupffer cells
respectively, and by demonstrating that exosomal targeting of CTGF or ICAM-1 by miR-214 or of SMAD 3 by
miR-532 recapitulates exosomal action in vivo and in vitro; and Aim 3 - Identify exosomal binding partners
of cellular integrins by establishing the role of hepatocyte FN, VN, or CTGF in engaging integrin αvβ3 or
α5β1 on HSC or hepatocytes and thereby mediating target cell binding. The rationale is that current methods
of treating liver fibrosis or ALD are inadequate and our approach is a cutting-edge and innovative solution that
harnesses natural disease-suppressing properties of exosomes. The expected outcome will be a novel
exosome-based therapy for treating fibrosis or alcohol-induced cell damage and altered immune function in the
liver. The positive impact will be to improve the health of millions of people globally with chronic liver disease."
10810637,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Imbalance of immune and inﬂammatory activity is a hallmark of immune-mediated dis-
eases. Genome-wide association studies have identiﬁed hundreds of loci that increase susceptibility to immune-
mediated diseases. Functional effects of these genetic variants are difﬁcult to infer as they might only impact a
particular cell type and their effects may be restricted to speciﬁc points in development. Studies on adult immune
cells have shed light on mediator cells and mechanisms of disease-associated variants, however, childhood is a
critical yet understudied stage in the development of the immune system. Genetic determinants of T cell develop-
ment and effector function during childhood have not been studied and their role in immune-mediated diseases
is unknown.
We propose to ﬁll gaps that link the genetics of immune-mediated diseases to their effector cells, developmen-
tal stages, and mechanisms. Our goals are 1) to understand the importance of genetically mediated T
cell development and central tolerance induction on immune-mediated diseases and 2) to identify the
importance of childhood immune phenotypes on disease in adulthood.
To reach these goals, we propose studying the dynamic genetic inﬂuences of human T cell development using
single-cell gene expression quantitative trait mapping in human pediatric thymus samples. To study the genetics
of the progression from development to peripheral effector function, we will collect peripheral immune cells from
the same pediatric patients. Furthermore, we will study genetic effects on pediatric immune cells in different
activation states to pinpoint genetic effects acting upon stimulation. To investigate genetic effects on immune
cells at different ages, we will integrate the genetic effects we identify in pediatric immune cells with those derived
from adult and neonatal cells from other studies. Lastly, we will examine genetic effects on central and peripheral
immune phenotypes in the context of immune-mediated diseases. We will generate proﬁles of chromatin accessi-
bility in thymus and peripheral immune cells to identify regulatory mechanisms in chromatin. This will allow us to
conduct colocalization studies of immune-mediated disease variants, immune cell-associated variants and open
chromatin regions. We will then estimate causality of immune phenotypes on immune-mediated diseases using
a Mendelian Randomization framework.
In summary, our research offers an innovative approach to study complex disease mechanisms: it combines
quantitative genetics and immunology using clinical specimens to generate new insights into the genetics of
immune-mediated diseases, their effector cells and molecular mechanisms. This mechanistic understanding of
disease-associated variants is fundamental for advancing towards novel treatments of immune-mediated dis-
eases."

 This proposal describes the framework of an R01 grant for Alejandro Balazs, PhD. Dr. Balazs is
currently an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School working as a principal investigator at the Ragon
Institute of MGH, MIT & Harvard. Dr. Balazs’ research is focused on engineering the immune system via gene
transfer as a novel means of creating protection against HIV. Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) show great promise in HIV prevention and therapy as they potently
neutralize a significant breadth of globally circulating HIV strains. Two recent Phase I clinical studies have
demonstrated the safety and potential for adeno associated virus (AAV) vectors to deliver bNAbs to human
participants following intramuscular injection. These have resulted in markedly different outcomes: A lack of
expression and significant immunogenicity from AAV1-PG9, or long-lived expression and less immunogenicity
from AAV8-VRC07. The mechanisms underlying these differences are poorly defined. This proposal will
uncover the elements of vectored immunoprophylaxis which are responsible for the immunogenicity seen in
human trials. It will dissect the immunological response during vector administration in patients at single-cell
resolution using multi-modal approaches. It will engineer novel AAV capsids designed to avoid stimulating the
immune system through directed evolution to avoid antigen presenting cells. Furthermore, it will test the
functional capacity of next-generation antibodies delivered by novel AAV capsids in animal models of
sustained virologic remission and evaluate the immune response to novel capsid designs. Together this work
will greatly enhance our understanding of the human immune response to AAV vectors and yield capsids that
eliminate the development of transgene immunogenicity to enable the use of vectored antibody delivery for HIV
cure strategies."
10816419,"CLINICAL PROTOCOL AND DATA MANAGEMENT
 PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Clinical Protocol and Data Management (CPDM) fulfills a vital function within the Chao Family Comprehensive
Cancer Center (CFCCC), directing and supporting effective clinical research operations. The CPDM function is
conducted by the Sue and Ralph Stern Center for Cancer Clinical Trials & Research (Stern Center), the
centralized office for clinical trial operations at the CFCCC. Stern Center leadership has both the clinical and
administrative expertise to nurture a culture of outstanding clinical research.
The Stern Center (~80 FTEs) provides a centralized resource for high quality, cost-effective and efficient
assistance to investigators in developing, activating and completing scientifically impactful clinical trials. The
Stern Center manages the largest portfolio of clinical trials at UCI, with a reputation as a visionary and best-
practice leader in clinical research operations across the institution.
The CFCCC Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) oversees institutional cancer clinical trials that are
interventional, as defined by the NCI's P30 Cancer Center Support Grant Data Table Guide. The DSMB is the
focal point of the Cancer Center's strategy to ensure the safety of subjects and the validity and integrity of data.
The NCI-approved Institutional Data and Safety Monitoring Plan requires that the DSMB review new Investigator
Initiated Trials, and monitor and audit trials via a risk-based approach. Audits are conducting by the Stern
Center's Quality Assurance Unit according to the Quality Assurance Monitoring and Auditing Plan. Results are
reported to the DSMB. The Quality Assurance Unit maintains a culture of excellence, safety, and compliance in
order to provide audit-ready operations at all times.
The CFCCC-defined Catchment Area is Orange County, which is the third-largest and second-most densely
populated county in California, the sixth-most populated county in the United States, and covers nearly 950
square miles. There are 3.2 million people living in 44 cities and towns in the CFCCC Catchment Area, and the
population is racially and ethnically diverse. The CFCCC is committed to recruiting women, minorities and
individuals across the lifespan to clinical trials. The CFCCC demonstrates equitable and proportionate inclusion
in clinical trials of all genders, races, ethnicities, and ages relative to the Catchment Area demographics and
patient population of the Center."
10816422,"PROTOCOL REVIEW AND MONITORING SYSTEM
 PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center (CFCCC) Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS)
ensures rigorous internal oversight of the scientific aspects of all cancer-related, hypothesis-driven clinical
research studies conducted at the University of California, Irvine. The Disease-Oriented Teams (DOTs) and
Protocol Review and Monitoring Committee (PRMC) together comprise CFCCC's two-stage PRMS. The PRMS
consists of qualified UCI faculty and staff with the necessary level of expertise within their respective scientific
research areas. Committee membership is of sufficient size and breadth of expertise to provide oversight and
review of all cancer-related research protocols. PRMS processes are governed by standard operating
procedures and guidelines. The PRMS is facilitated and supported by the Sue and Ralph Stern Center for Cancer
Clinical Trials & Research (Stern Center), the centralized office for clinical trial operations at the CFCCC.
The first component of the CFCCC's two-stage review process, the DOTs, are multidisciplinary groups of basic,
translational, clinical, and population health investigators who collaborate on a specific anatomic cancer area in
order to further the translation of CFCCC discoveries through the pipeline towards interventional clinical trials.
The focus of the DOTs is to ensure rigorous internal scientific review of protocols, manage the clinical trial
portfolio, and drive innovation. The DOTs formally score protocols for prioritization based on investigator input,
scientific merit, the potential for correlative science and academic credit for CFCCC investigators, study accrual
potential, existence of active competing trials and whether the disease under investigation disproportionately
affects minority populations in the CFCCC's Catchment Area. The DOTs also perform the assessment of
scientific quality for NCTN and industry studies.
The PRMC is responsible for the second stage of scientific and feasibility review of protocols and has the sole
authority to authorize activation of clinical studies. The PRMC assesses scientific merit and quality for institutional
investigator-initiated trials (IITs), determines if the CFCCC has the appropriate resources to support the trial and
determines how the trial fits into the broader research agenda of the CFCCC. The PRMC is responsible for the
continuing review of open protocols for scientific progress and has sole authority to close trials due to lack of
progress, new safety information, or scientific relevance. The rigor of the CFCCC PRMS ensures the scientific
quality and progress of clinical research conducted at the Cancer Center and the appropriate management of
the Center's resources. The PRMS is critical to the CFCCC's mission to develop new knowledge about the
causes, prevention, detection, treatment, and survival of cancer to shift scientific paradigms, change public policy
and clinical practice, and eliminate cancer health disparities."

10816616,"Natural selection on genetic variation is the ultimate cause of adaptation and the formation of new species. All
studies of natural selection at the genomic level require a control group: a set of variants or substitutions that
have not been subject to selection. The class of variants that, by far, are the most widely used for this purpose
are synonymous changes within protein coding genes. Because these variants are interspersed with
nonsynonymous variants, they are a natural control group. However, overwhelming evidence that synonymous
changes are often not strictly neutral has accumulated over the past three decades. In many contexts the clear
evidence for selection provides investigators with ways to identify which synonymous changes are most likely to
be affected by selection and which are more likely to be strictly neutral. What is missing are ways to include this
information, on classified synonymous changes (neutral and selected), within quantitative evolutionary models
that enable a broad range of inferences about where, when, and on what selection operates. The proposed
research is based on a new class of evolutionary models (Multiple Synonymous Substitution or MSS models)
that include both selected and neutral synonymous changes in estimates of evolutionary change. These models
can be fitted to homologous sequence alignments to infer relative rates of amino-acid replacement changes, and
selected synonymous changes, to strictly neutral synonymous changes. These types of (dN/dS) analyses go
back to the origins of evolutionary genetics, and today they remain among the most commonly used tools. Our
hypothesis is that the current definition of what constitutes neutrally evolving sites is importantly wrong in that
it biases the estimation of selective forces (by underestimating the rates of neutral changes), and that improved
estimates without that bias will provide significantly better and more accurate understanding of the action of
natural selection in a broad array of evolutionary contexts. We will develop and test a new class of substitution
model that uses multiple sets of synonymous substitutions (MSS models), and we will apply them to a diverse
set of taxa sampled from across life's kingdoms. Estimated MSS models, discovered using a genetic algorithm
that searches over the space of all possible MSS models, will be validated using internal controls, based on
neutral model predictions of substitution rate speed and constancy, and using external controls, based on
predicted covariates of population genomic and functional effects. We will revise an array of widely-used
comparative and population genetics techniques to take advantage of MSS models, and develop new
approaches that seek to identify selection on synonymous changes. Our models will be applied to a wide
taxonomic range of genomic data and made available as a part of popular software package HyPhy and web
application Datamonkey."

pollution and lifestyle factors to understand their role in human health and diseases. The CIEHS Community
Engagement Core (CEC) vision is to develop and sustain community-academic partnerships that enhance the
health of south-central and western Kentucky residents by empirically addressing pollution and lifestyle factors
influencing chronic diseases. The aims of the CEC are to: (1) facilitate and support multi-directional
interactions among residents, community agencies and the CIEHS to assess community needs and priorities;
(2) facilitate and support multi-directional interactions to increase community awareness and understanding of
CIEHS research and resources; 3) cultivate environmental literacy among identified audiences; and (4) build
capacity for community-led and community-engaged environmental health research. The approach to engage
the identified audiences has three tiers: (1) engage community residents via housing agencies to assess
environmental health needs and community priorities; (2) involve healthcare providers to impact the healthcare
system as it relates to environmental health needs; (3) share environmental health knowledge with community
youth as a catalyst to promote environmental health literacy within families. In Aim 1, the CEC will work directly
with residents and community partners across south-central and western Kentucky to assess their unique

UofL AHEC areas include smaller urban areas, multiple townships, and rural areas. Residents in these rural
areas are exposed to diverse environmental exposures from industry (e.g., rural distilleries; urban/small
town/rural manufacturing), 12 superfund sites, and urban and rural agriculture. The CEC is an integral core
within the CIEHS structure with direct impact on CIEHS research direction and decision-making."
10817706,"The overarching objective of the Integrated Health Sciences Facility Core (IHSFC) of the Center for Integrated
Environmental Health Sciences (CIEHS) is to translate basic research on pollution and lifestyle factors
influencing human health and chronic diseases. The multi-disciplinary IHSFC provides infrastructure facilitating
translational human subjects EHS research for the CIEHS, university, and community. The ultimate goal is to
improve public health and clinical practice. The IHSFC supports patient-oriented clinical research; group and
population-based research; and community engaged/led research. The IHSFC is comprised of two interacting
subunits: the Research Administration and Planning Subunit (RAPS) and the Research Implementation
Subunit (RIS). The IHSFC interacts with other CIEHS cores and the Research Interest Groups (RIGs) to (i)
provide access to state-of-the-art instrumentation and technologies; (ii) increase multidisciplinary collaboration;
and (iii) enhance partnerships with community-based organizations. The IHSFC’s first specific aim is to
administer the IHSFC and plan translational human subjects EHS research. This aim is performed by RAPS.
RAPS provides IHSFC access to CIEHS members, trainees, and the community. RAPS solicits applications for
human subjects research; and then reviews, prioritizes and financially subsidizes supported applications.
RAPS defines IHSFC research in the context of the NIEHS Translational Research Framework. Community-
proposed research ideas are assigned to an appropriate CIEHS member for development and execution.
RAPS provides translational research training/education; and tracks and reports performance metrics to the
Administrative Core for evaluation. RAPS provides scientific, study design, and community engagement
consultation through linkages to the RIGs and other CIEHS cores. These consultations ensure that all IHSFC-
supported studies: (i) are rigorously designed and powered; (ii) are consistent with CIEHS’s theme and
research interests; and (iii) consider the involvement of community organizations impacting this research. The
IHSFC’s second specific aim is to implement IHSFC research. This aim is performed by the RIS. RIS provides
human subjects research services and access to state-of-the-art bio-analytic instrumentation and technologies
through linkage to the Integrated Toxicomics & Environmental Measurement Facility Core (ITEMFC). In turn,
ITEMFC measures exposure and ‘omics-based disease biomarkers. RIS leverages UofL’s adult Clinical Trials
Unit (CTU), the Kosair Charities Pediatric Clinical Research Units (KCPCRU), and existing
cohorts/biorepositories to obtain human subjects data and biological samples. Next, RIS provides linkage to
other CIEHS cores for biomarker measurement, data analysis, and knowledge dissemination. Based on the
combination of physician-scientists engaged in EHS research and clinical research units found nowhere else,
the IHSFC has the unique capacity to conduct impactful translational EHS research, including biomarker
studies and interventional clinical trials."
10814438,"Project Summary. Beginning in the medial temporal lobe, an interplay of neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid
plaques contributes to neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). By the time cortical and hippocampal
volume loss are detected with structural imaging, there has been extensive neuronal loss. Since neuroprotective
therapies need to be administered prior to irreversible tissue loss, there is an unmet need for early detection of
cortical alterations in the medial temporal lobe. Given the importance of connectivity centered in the
hippocampus for long-term memory, early markers of microstructural degeneration and decreased connectivity
could serve as diagnostic biomarkers early in the disease course. Specifically, tau pathology starting in the
entorhinal cortex impacts the perforant pathway, the main fiber tract carrying input from the entorhinal cortex to
the hippocampal formation. While in vivo diffusion MRI demonstrated evidence of perforant pathway
degeneration in aging, detecting degeneration of the perforant pathway in vivo in AD has thus far remained
elusive due to the small size of this structure.
 Recent diffusion MRI models such as NODDI have shown promise in studying microstructural degeneration
in AD, which may be detectable before frank atrophy. However, cortical thinning due to atrophy may confound
estimates of advanced diffusion metrics because of partial volume effects at low resolution. Observing
microstructural alterations in the medial temporal lobe cortices requires submillimeter resolution given that their
thickness can be as low as 1.5 mm. Unfortunately, high-resolution diffusion MRI in the medial temporal lobe is
hampered by technical and physiological barriers. The proximity of medial temporal lobe cortices to air-tissue
interfaces leads to large B0 inhomogeneity, severe signal pileup, and distortions in diffusion-weighted echo planar
imaging (EPI). A technical leap is needed to address the artifacts that plague EPI and provide high-resolution,
high-fidelity, and high-SNR diffusion MRI of the medial temporal lobe. We propose diffusion MRI technology that
will eliminate distortions, minimize blurring, and boost SNR to provide high-resolution, high-fidelity, and high-
SNR diffusion MRI of the medial temporal lobe in AD. We will develop a vendor-agnostic, distortion-free EPI
acquisition to eliminate distortions and signal pileups and provide sensitive measurements amenable to high-
resolution tractography and microstructural modeling. We will combine this with a motion-corrected volumetric
encoding strategy to boost SNR and motion robustness. We will scan 15 subjects each in groups of mild cognitive
impairment (MCI), AD, and controls using the developed technology, and test the hypothesis that perforant
pathway fiber density and cross section and microstructural metrics from NODDI will be significantly reduced in
the medial temporal lobe cortices of MCI and AD patients compared to cognitively healthy older adults. The
developed technology will offer a noninvasive imaging biomarker of cortical neurodegeneration early in the
disease course, rendering neuroprotective treatments viable before the onset of irreversible neuronal loss."

CIEHS research by providing state-of-the-art statistical and bioinformatics support and training to all CIEHS
members. The BIFC is an essential resource for designing systematic acquisition and deposition of preclinical

framework to integrate translational basic science research on pollution and lifestyle cofactors influencing
chronic disease risk requires sophisticated statistical support. The BIFC addresses this need by using state-of-
art techniques related to statistics and informatics as it serves CIEHS members during all phases of their
studies. The BIFC provides seamless infrastructure and support to CIEHS member research, including
preclinical-basic science, patient-oriented clinical research (e.g., the diagnosis, prevention, and therapy of
environmentally-related disorders), public health/population-based research, and community-engaged /
community-led research. The aims of the BIFC are: 1. Provide state-of-the-art statistical support in design,
analysis and dissemination of findings of a range of basic science, translational, clinical, population health and
environmental epidemiology studies; 2. Provide support for the integration of multi-omics data from both animal
and human studies; 3. Facilitate integration of exposure data with lifestyle factors to identify effect modifiers
and mediators of the health effects of environmental exposures; 4. Educate center investigators, staff and
trainees in new methods related to statistics/omics approaches applicable to their research activities. Areas of
special interest include, repeated measures models, measurement error, spatio-temporal methods,
computational biology, statistical genetics, clinical informatics and Bayesian methods. Several CIEHS
members currently use the statistical support services of the BIFC Director and staff, demonstrating both need
and productive interactions. An IDeA grant to the Kentucky Biomedical Research Infrastructure Network and
INBRE provides partial support for some BIFC bioinformatics personnel and access to a variety of
bioinformatics and statistical tools. By leveraging and building upon existing resources at UofL, the BIFC is
able to facilitate access and use of these resources by CIEHS members and expand statistical and
bioinformatics support in a more cost efficient manner."

10817737,"Clinical Core: Summary 
The overall goal of this U19 is to elucidate the pregnancy immunome as it governs maternal and fetal health. A 
large gap in knowledge exists regarding innate and adaptive immune responses over the course of pregnancy 
and how perturbations in the immunological signature, in each trimester of pregnancy, manifest in attributable 
risk to the mother and fetus. An immune paradox exists in pregnancy, as the mother must tolerate a semi- 
allogenic fetus while protecting herself and the fetus from pathogenic challenge. Revealing the comprehensive 
function of maternal immunity through pregnancy will undoubtedly lead to advanced understanding of maternal 
morbidity and mortality from illness such as influenza and COVID-19 and, as such, open new, previously 
unrecognized, therapeutic windows. Current therapies to prevent maternal morbidity include vaccinations, which 
afford benefit to both the mother and fetus. Yet, our ability to maximize maternal and fetal benefit from 
vaccination is limited due to a large gap in knowledge regarding the ever-shifting nature of maternal immunity 
across gestation. Maternal vaccination, such as that against influenza, provides enhanced immunity to prevent 
maternal morbidity and mortality from seasonal influenza. Maternal vaccination against influenza is universally 
recommended for maternal benefit. Fetal benefit from maternal vaccination against influenza is a noted additional 
benefit but is not the primary driver of vaccine advocacy among pregnant individuals. In contrast, maternal 
vaccination can be employed to have a direct benefit to the fetus in the absence of known benefit to the 
mother (e.g. DPT). While maternal vaccination is utilized for both maternal and fetal benefit, the lack of 
knowledge regarding immunity during pregnancy, and how it shifts with gestational age and external stimuli (e.g. 
viral infection, vaccination), greatly impedes needed advancement in maternal and fetal health. The clinical core 
will support all the projects in this proposal though existing biobanks from key investigators, as well as the 
acquisition of a new racially and ethnically diverse pregnancy cohort. These unique cohorts will support our 
proposal Maternal ‘Omics to Maximize Immunity (MOMi). The core will have two focuses for which there 
are tremendous existing gaps in knowledge: 1) to leverage existing longitudinal samples from mothers across 
pregnancy with comprehensive biobanking and rigorous clinical phenotyping and 2) to collect longitudinal 
samples from pregnant individuals receiving clinically indicated vaccines as “boosts” (e.g. SARS-CoV-2, Flu, and 
DPT). These new foci will facilitate the first systematic analyses of longitudinal innate and adaptive immunity in 
pregnant individuals and how maternal vaccinations leverage or perturbs pregnant immune health. A continued 
focus of the Clinical Core will be to maintain and expand a large bank of blood and tissue samples from pregnant 
individuals and to rigorously phenotype all participants, in order to address the impact of clinical variables 
associated with immune perturbations (e.g. BMI, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, diabetes)."
10817738,"Project 1: Summary
The COVID-19 pandemic has revolutionized our ability to decode the rules of maternal immunity. There is a
significant gap in knowledge regarding innate and adaptive immune responses over the course of pregnancy
and how trimester-specific perturbations in the maternal immunological signature might manifest in attributable
risk or benefit to the maternal-fetal dyad. The COVID-19 vaccines and their real-world use by pregnant women
present a unique opportunity to define the baseline, trimester-specific immune signature, and to examine the
maternal immune response after in vivo perturbation with both de novo (never before seen by the immune
system) and recall (boosted responses such as influenza and pertussis) vaccines across the trimesters of
pregnancy. In Project 1 in the Maternal ‘Omics to Maximize Immunity (MOMi) consortium, we propose to
apply a multi-‘OMICs approach to deeply and comprehensively capture shifts in the maternal immune
response before and after maternal immunization across pregnancy. We will profile maternal peripheral
blood mononuclear cells, plasma, placental cell isolates, and stool from pre- and post-maternal vaccination,
using single cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq), Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin with high-throughput
sequencing (scATAC-Seq), Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing (scCITE-Seq),
proteomics, metabolomics, and metagenomics, and integrate all data through the Data Management and
Analysis Core (DMAC). In collaboration with Project 2, the ultimate goal is to define maternal immunity
longitudinally across pregnancy trimesters in the normal baseline and vaccinated state, in order to build the most
comprehensive Pregnancy Immune Atlas of innate and adaptive immune profiling across the maternal-fetal
dyad. We will examine how the cellular transcriptome, microbiome, metabolome, and proteome shifts over the
course of pregnancy, and how they are modified in response to different vaccine platforms (mRNA, adenovirus,
adjuvanted protein) and types (de novo versus recall), providing a unique opportunity to profile the maternal
immune response with unprecedented resolution. This detailed map of pregnancy immunity will generate critical
data to open previously unrecognized therapeutic windows in this unusual and understudied area of human
immunology."

10817049,"Abstract and Project Summary
A growing number of studies show strong evidence that one mechanism predisposing older adults to an
increased risk of chronic pain conditions is an age-related decline in conditioned pain modulation (CPM), a
psychophysical index of endogenous pain inhibition. However, the central mechanisms underlying age
differences in CPM and the causal links between dysfunctional CPM and chronic pain conditions are largely
unknown. This project explores the brain networks that underlie age differences in descending noxious inhibitory
control (DNIC), a measure that is similar to CPM in preclinical settings, and the mechanistic links between
dysfunctional DNIC and osteoarthritis (OA)-related pain, a chronic pain condition that disproportionately affects
the aged population. Our prior work has demonstrated that the efficiency of DNIC is reduced in young female
rats, and DNIC efficiency is also impaired in old rats of both sexes. Additionally, we demonstrated that OA-related
primary mechanical hyperalgesia was longer-lasting and more pronounced in older rats, with aged female rats
experiencing the most severe aging effects. We then provided compelling evidence that the altered DNIC in
young female rats and old rats is strongly associated with a weaker resting functional connectivity (FC) between
the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and the periaqueductal gray (PAG). Our studies collectively suggest
that strong rACC to PAG FC is a cornerstone of efficient DNIC, and age-related alteration in rACC to PAG FC
leads to dysfunctional DNIC and chronic OA pain. Here we propose that enhancement of the rACC to PAG circuit
in aged rats will lead to improved DNIC and that strengthening DNIC in aged rats will effectively attenuate chronic
OA pain responses. We will investigate our proposal with three specific aims (SAs). (SA1) We hypothesize that
selective activation of rACC neurons projecting to PAG will significantly enhance DNIC efficiency in aged rats.
We will use a behavioral paradigm for DNIC paired with chemogenetics to experimentally manipulate the strength
of the rACC to PAG circuit in aged male and female rats. (SA2) We will investigate the potential causal
relationship between DNIC and OA responses in aged rats. We hypothesize that scaling up DNIC efficiency by
enhancing the rACC to PAG circuit significantly improves OA outcomes in aged rats. We will conduct a
concurrent fMRI study to confirm that experimental manipulation of DNIC circuitry restores OA-induced changes
in the brain networks of aged male and female rats. (SA3) Exercise is known to enhance CPM in humans. Our
preliminary data show that regular exercise can also significantly improve DNIC in aged rats. We hypothesize
that exercise increases the strength of the rACC to PAG circuit, thereby enhancing DNIC, reducing OA-related
pain, and restoring altered brain networks in aged male and female rats. These studies will significantly improve
our knowledge regarding the impact of aging on pain processing, an area of pain research that has been largely
inadequate. Our animal models allow rigorous validation of the brain circuits that underlie age-related changes
in DNIC and of the mechanistic links between dysfunctional DNIC and chronic OA pain in the aged population.
Translationally, these results promise to yield novel insights into both pharmacological and non-pharmacological
strategies to enhance CPM, furthering our understanding of viable evidence-based treatments for OA pain and
potentially for other chronic pain conditions in the elderly."
10817021,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in humans have revealed that heritable variation in most traits of
interest arises from genetic differences in numerous genes. Yet our ability to use GWAS to learn about trait
biology and disease etiology remains limited by the fact that we still not understand how what GWAS detect—
the contribution of a gene to variation in a trait—relates to the importance of the gene to the biology of the trait.
The high polygenicity revealed by GWAS has a second implication, supporting the notion that adaptive changes
to traits in humans and in other species will often be “polygenic”, i.e., result from changes in allele frequencies
at many small effect loci. How this mode of selection is expected to behave also remains poorly understood,
however, impeding our ability to search for its footprints in genomic data. Moreover, despite the expectation that
polygenic adaptation should be ubiquitous, there are notable examples of large effect adaptive differences
(“sweeps”) between populations and species, raising the question of the conditions under which one mode of
adaptation is favored over another. Here, we plan to address these gaps in our understanding as follows: Aim 1.
When should ‘important genes’ stand out in GWAS? We will combine (i) our model from the last grant period,
which describes from first principles how the contribution of a locus to heritability in a focal trait depends on its
effects on that trait and on others subject to stabilizing selection, with (ii) a model describing how allelic effects
on traits arise from their direct (e.g., cis) and indirect (e.g., trans) effects on the activity of genes in a network.
In this way, we will relate the importance of a gene to a focal trait (and to others) with its contribution to
heritability in the focal trait. The modeling will also generate predictions about how the heritability attributed to
a gene relates to heritable variance in its expression levels and to its level of selective constraint; these predictions
will be tested for >49 quantitative traits. Aim 2. How do phenotypes and alleles respond to changing selection
pressures on complex traits? We will extend our modeling of the polygenic adaptation that occurs after a complex
quantitative trait experiences a sudden shift in fitness optimum to consider (i) that alleles affecting a focal trait
often have deleterious, pleiotropic effects on other traits, i.e., that selection occurs in a multi-dimensional trait
space, and (ii) that selection pressures on complex traits may change more rapidly than it takes for genetic
variation to equilibrate after a single shift, i.e., that there may be repeated shifts in that timeframe. Aim 3. When
should we expect a highly polygenic adaptive response versus one involving few changes of large effect (e.g.,
sweeps)? By placing these different modes of adaptation within the same modeling framework, we will
characterize how the polygenicity and predictability of the adaptive response depend on trait, population and
selection parameters. Thus, we will provide a much-needed theoretical foundation with which to interpret
GWAS findings, guide the search for the footprint of polygenic adaptation, and understand what determines
the polygenicity and predictability of adaptation."

This proposal outlines a 5 year career development program designed to further my research program into the
function and potential therapeutic utility of immune checkpoint molecules in the pediatric brain tumor,
medulloblastoma (MB), the most common malignant brain tumor in children. As a pediatric neuro-oncologist, I
am passionate about finding novel therapies for the ~25% of children whose tumors do not respond to
standard treatment and have no cure. This proposal builds on my previous research evaluating the expression
of PD-L1 in MB and generating a syngeneic animal model of MYC-driven anaplastic MB that mimics recurrent
disease. I previously found that there was a paucity of PD-L1 expression in MB and thus far clinical trials of
antibodies targeting this pathway have not met with significant success. Therefore, I moved my research
program from Johns Hopkins University to Albert Einstein College of Medicine (AECOM)/Montefiore Medical
Center (MMC) for the opportunity to work with my mentor, XingXing Zang, PhD on the novel B7 family immune
checkpoint molecule, B7-H3, which is highly expressed in MB and represents an attractive therapeutic target.
The scientific objective of this proposal is to evaluate the efficacy of B7-H3 blocking antibodies as a treatment
for MB and lay the preclinical foundation for a future clinical trial. To accomplish this, I will study B7-H3 in my
murine MB model as well as in classic human MB cell lines, and human MB patient samples. These studies
stem from published literature reporting B7-H3 in human MB and my own preliminary data demonstrating its
expression in my model. I will have strong support from my mentor, Dr. Zang, who has developed the
translational B7-H3 blocking antibodies for this study as well as tools to knock down B7-H3 in the tumor and in
the infiltrating immune cells. The purpose of this project is to both complete my scientific aims and to provide
me with the additional knowledge and skills to launch a fully independent pediatric brain tumor research
program. I will increase my immunology and neuroscience knowledge by participating in graduate courses and
interacting with Dr. Zang an immunologist, and my co-mentor, Emad Eskandar, MD, a neuroscientist. I will
obtain new skills important to the completion of this project that will also serve me in future research endeavors
including the generation of bone marrow chimeric mice, and the analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data. I will
participate in genomics and bioinformatics courses to familiarize myself with genomics techniques and learn
the proper biostatistical methods to interpret them. These important skills will lay the foundation for my future
an independent physician scientist."

Glucose is the primary fuel in the brain. Glucose-sensing neurons in the brain respond to glucose fall by
altering their firing activities, which trigger the counterregulatory responses to prevent severe hypoglycemia.
The ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) is a critical component of neural networks that coordinate the
counterregulation. While the majority of VMH neurons are glutamatergic which have been well studied, a
small population of neurons in the ventrolateral subdivision of VMH (vlVMH) is GABAergic as they express
vesicular GABA transporter (Vgat). The functions of these Vgat neurons in the vlVMH (VgatvlVMH neurons)
have never been studied. We found that the majority of these are glucose-inhibited (GI) neurons. Since the
ionic mechanisms by which GI neurons respond to hypoglycemia are less defined, these GI-VgatvlVMH
neurons provide a unique opportunity to reveal the mechanisms and functions of a brain GI population.
Following our pilot observations, we will combine fiber photometry, electrophysiology, optogenetics, Patch-
seq, and CRISPR gene editing to test a general hypothesis that VgatvlVMH neurons represent a unique GI
population that are activated during hypoglycemia and critically contribute to the counterregulatory
response. The first objective is to establish the glucose-sensing functions of VgatvlVMH neurons in functional
animals and to further confirm their roles in regulating blood glucose levels. Second, we will determine if the
T-type voltage-gated calcium channel Cav3.2 mediates the glucose-sensing functions of GI neurons and
therefore regulate the counterregulation. Finally, we will identify VgatvlVMH-originated circuits that regulate the
counterregulation. The accomplishment of these studies may reveal the important functions of a novel neural
population that has never been studied before. We may also reveal ionic mechanisms for the glucose-sensing
functions of GI neurons. Further, we will delineate a new molecular target for brain glucose-sensing and the
counterregulation, which may provide a framework for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for
glycemic control."

Among the known risk factors for late-onset AD, age is considered the greatest. After age of 65, the risk of
developing AD doubles every five years. While there is a consensus that late-onset AD mainly impacts the
aging brain, the direct effects of aging on development and progression of AD have been mostly overlooked. In
fact, the majority of human neuroimaging studies of AD consider age as a confounding factor when reporting
the AD outcomes. Several age-related processes including inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, synaptic
loss and vascular dysfunction may contribute to AD. These processes impact microstructural properties of gray
and white matter such as neurite morphology years before they can be reliably detected using conventional
MRI measures. They also impact network-level computations as brain reorganizes to compensate for these
changes. A gap in knowledge is that brain regions that show most age-related changes in their microstructural
organization may be more vulnerable to AD pathology. Advances in MRI techniques have provided us with the
ability to probe microstructural organization of cortical and white matter such as neurite morphology in human
in vivo. To bridge this gap and in response to the high-priority research topic PAR-19-070 (NOT-AG-18-051:
understanding AD in the context of aging brain), we propose a multi-level study to examine microstructural
(e.g., cortical neurite morphology) and connectome-level organizational properties of brain networks that are
most affected in aging and may contribute to AD. We will pursue three Aims: (1) To examine microstructural
properties of gray matter and white matter that are most vulnerable in aging and are most impacted by AD
pathology. We will leverage Stanford ADRC PET-MR and deep phenotyping resources and will collect novel,
quantitative MRI markers of brain microstructure including measures of neurite morphology and
macromolecular tissue volume (MTV) in 120 older adults who have a clinical consensus diagnosis of either
cognitively normal controls (HC) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and will be confirmed to be Aβ- or Aβ+
with PET; (2) To examine the interaction of aging and AD on organizational properties of human connectome.
We will leverage ADNI neuroimaging data to achieve this goal and will validate the findings using an
independent dataset, namely the Stanford ADRC dataset; (3) To characterize the trajectory of changes in
organizational properties of brain networks in normal aging and during transition to AD phenotypes. Leveraging
ADNI longitudinal data, we will apply connectomic analysis, accelerated longitudinal design with mixed effect
modelling to model the trajectory of organizational changes of brain networks in normal aging and test the
alterations of trajectories at different stages of AD. Successful completion of this study will significantly improve
our understanding of AD in the context of aging and will inform development of novel therapeutics of AD
targeting aging mechanisms."

range of cell types from more than one germ layer has led to CNCCs being called “pleistopotent.” However, the
signaling mechanisms that convey this pleistopotency and drive differentiation of CNCCs are not well
understood. The Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway has long been studied in the context of craniofacial
development. The Shh signaling pathway is mediated by bimodal Gli transcription factors (Gli TFs), which
activate or repress target genes associated with proper craniofacial development. Studies done on CNCC in
vitro demonstrated that exposure to recombinant Shh protein increased CNCC potency by increasing the
proportion of CNCCs that differentiated into both non-ectomesenchymal and ectomesenchymal derivatives and
decreased the proportion of CNCCs that only differentiated into non-ectomesenchymal derivatives. To test the
role of Shh signaling in CNCC potency, we generated a conditional mouse line lacking Gli activity in CNCCs
(Gli2f/f;Gli3f/f;Wnt1-Cre). Single cell RNA-sequencing analysis showed that E13.5 Gli2f/f;Gli3f/f;Wnt1-Cre CNCCs
were not separated into distinct clusters as compared to the wild-type CNCCs. Interestingly, while
ectomesenchymal clusters were poorly defined molecularly, non-ectomesenchymal clusters were relatively
unaffected. Thus, these data suggested that loss of Gli TFs led correlated with a loss of pleistopotency. Based
on these preliminary data I hypothesize that Gli-mediated Shh signaling conveys CNCC potency via activation
of pluripotent programs and that loss of Gli2/3 signaling limits potency, thus preventing differentiation into the full
range of CNCC derivatives. In Aim 1, I will perform CUT&RUN for Gli2 and Gli3 on embryos during CNCC
induction to look for binding of Gli TFs at traditional pluripotency markers. I will perform single cell RNA-
sequencing on both wild-type and Gli2f/f;Gli3f/f;Wnt1-Cre embryos before, during, and after CNCC induction and
specification and compare gene expression profiles to determine if loss of Gli TFs affects expression of potency
factors in CNCC, which I will validate with RNAscope. Finally, I will perform Western blots for Gli2 and Gli3 to
determine if Gli TFs are predominantly functioning as activators or repressors during CNCC induction. In Aim 2,
I will determine if loss of Gli TFs restricts fate commitment of CNCCs. I will generate Gli2f/f;Gli3f/f;R26R-Confetti+/+;
Wnt1-Cre embryos, where Wnt1-Cre drives Cre-recombination before establishment of CNCC pleistopotency,
and Gli2f/f;Gli3f/f;R26R-Confetti+/+;Sox10-Cre embryos, where Sox10-Cre drives Cre-recombination after
establishment of CNCC pleistopotency. This study is important for advancing our understanding of the unique
potency of CNCCs in craniofacial development and the knowledge generated in this proposal may be applied to
generate reparative tissues for patients with craniofacial defects or injuries."

Most patients who fracture have non-osteoporotic bone mineral density. Often, the result of a fracture is
devastating and results in substantial morbidity and health care costs. One cause of fragility in these patients is
poor bone quality that subsequently contributes to higher risk for fracture. Yet few techniques are available to
accurately assess bone quality in the clinic. Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the most used clinical
surrogate for fracture risk, but DXA does not account for bone quality and thus overestimates bone health.
OsteoProbe® Reference Point Indenter enables the measurement of bone quality in human patients and has
been used safely on over 7,000 individuals. The OsteoProbe® quantifies bone material quality as a measure
termed bone material strength index (BMSi). Measurements are made in a routine exam on the midshaft of the
tibia by a safe and rapid microindentation process. A significant and predictive relationship has been
demonstrated between tibial BMSi and fracture occurrence at multiple skeletal sites in published studies and in
our Phase II study. Since fragility fractures occur most often at the hip, wrist, and the spine, this renewal will
allow us to confirm the predictive relationship between OsteoProbe measurements at the tibia and bone strength
at these clinically relevant skeletal sites on male cadavers. As in our original Phase II, we hypothesize that tibial
OsteoProbe® measurements will predict bone strength at the whole bone and tissue levels at the hip, wrist, and
spine for both males and females. At each of these skeletal sites, OsteoProbe measurements, BMD, and whole
bone and tissue level mechanical testing will be performed. The renewal proposal aims to: (1) establish and
confirm the mechanistic basis by which a clinically relevant surrogate of in vivo bone strength could be accurately
measured at the hip, wrist, and spine for males; (2) develop OsteoProbe into a more manufacturable device that
can be produced and supported in volume; and (3) provide pivotal data for an FDA 510(k) approval of a new,
commercially attractive, and reimbursable marketing claim for OsteoProbe."

 2 Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) affects over one third of US adults aged between 65 and 74, over a half of
 3 adults over 75 years old, and over 460 million people worldwide. Since SNHL commonly affects the high
 4 frequencies first, many of these patients complain that they “can hear but can’t understand.” This is because
 5 patients can hear sound because of relatively good residual low frequency hearing, but they struggle to
 6 understand speech, which relies on the higher frequencies that these patients have lost. The inability to
 7 understand speech can profoundly degrade patients’ quality-of-life, and the links to social withdrawal, isolation,
 8 depression, and dementia have been well established. With 3.3 million adults in the US already affected by this
 9 form of hearing loss and with the number increasing as the population ages, this represents a major and growing
10 public health challenge.
11 Hearing aids cannot provide benefit for these patients, and the only available treatment is a cochlear implant.
12 These are irreversible and come with a 50% risk of residual hearing loss, causing most patients to forgo
13 treatment. Thus, there remains a large unmet clinical need for treatments that can improve SNHL patients’ ability
14 to understand speech by restoring high-frequency hearing without damaging residual low-frequency hearing.
15 Auricle Health, Inc., is building an extracochlear device that uses cochlear nerve stimulation to restore high-
16 frequency hearing with a minimally invasive implant that will be reversible and will not damage residual hearing.
17 The Auricle team came out of the Stanford Biodesign Innovation Program and validated their solution with
18 stakeholders ranging from patients to neurotologists, audiologists, and regulatory and reimbursement experts.
19 The team has built initial prototypes of an electrode array and demonstrated feasibility of their approach in a
20 clinical study at Stanford.
21 In Phase I, the team will refine key design requirements and build and test more sophisticated prototypes.
22 We will refine the electrode design and attachment method to the cochlea to achieve consistent electrical
23 connection with the underlying tissue. Next, we will demonstrate that we can establish good electrical contact
24 with our prototype electrode and stimulate the cochlear nerve in an acute animal model. Finally, we will conduct
25 a chronic animal study to evaluate the durability of the electrode attachment and long-term tissue responses to
26 the implant. Successful completion of these aims will advance the design of the device and validate the safety
27 and functionality of the approach. Building on this foundation, in Phase II we will finalize electrode design and
28 conduct animal studies in large animals to confirm the device’s effectiveness and safety. Ultimately, we hope to
29 bring hearing back to patients through a non-destructive and minimally invasive approach."

receive NIH career development awards in patient-oriented research. Dr. Milstone is a highly
productive clinical researcher with more than 200 manuscripts, more than 95 first-authored by
his mentees. He has had continuous federal-funding since 2009 to support his research

the areas of antibiotic-resistance and infection prevention and to continue to evolve his
research. Dr. Milstone will pursue additional training to expand his research program. The
proposed novel research will further advance the field in preventing antibiotic resistance and
healthcare-associated infections in three areas: 1) bacterial culture stewardship to reduce
antibiotic use and resistance, 2) targeting the nasal microbiome to reduce S. aureus nasal
colonization and infection, and 3) identify and address drivers of inequities in pediatric
healthcare associated infections. The proposed projects will build on collaborations in
implementation science, microbiome, and health equity, expand the Dr. Milstone's knowledge in
these areas, and make him a more effective PI and patient-oriented research mentor."
10796022,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Structural variants (SVs) play a causal role in numerous diseases. However, our ability to detect and analyze
disease-causing SVs, particularly de novo SVs, in short read genome sequencing data is limited by inaccurate
genotyping (determining zygosity). There exists a substantial gap between the genotyping accuracy for small
variants, e.g., single nucleotide variants, and SVs. Improving the accuracy of SV genotyping will increase the
rates of molecular diagnosis, improve our understanding of multiple diseases, and expand our knowledge of
human genetic variation. Our aim is to develop more accurate tools for genotyping SVs in short read genome
sequencing data by incorporating the specific genomic context, sequencing instrument, and analysis pipeline
into the genotyping model. Instead of attempting to develop a parametric model for those complex and
interconnected processes, we generate estimates of the expected evidence using simulation. Our goals are to:
1. Develop a deep learning-based SV genotyper that automatically learns informative features shared by the
real and simulated data in an image-based representation of the SV. Treating SV genotyping as an image
similarity problem will enable us to more accurately genotype the many different SVs that might exist, not just
those observed previously. 2. Deploy our new method to generate accurate genotypes for an ensemble of
short and long-read derived SV call sets in thousands of human genomes. The resulting dataset will increase
our understanding of the spectrum of structural variation across diverse populations. 3. Leverage our similarity
model to automatically correct otherwise imprecise or incorrect SV descriptions; doing so will increase
genotyping accuracy, improve the integration of different SV call sets, and enable more sensitive SV discovery
in the future."

This proposal describes a 3-year training program for the development of an academic career in the research
of psychiatric disease. The candidate is a rising third-year graduate student in the Neuroscience Graduate
Program at the University of Michigan, studying addiction- and PTSD-related behaviors in rats. She obtained
degrees in Neuroscience and Animal Science from Virginia Tech while pursuing undergraduate research in
behavioral neuroscience before beginning her PhD in neuroscience. To further develop the requisite skills for
success in this field, she has identified 3 training objectives: 1) learn to perform behavioral neuroscience
experiments and to use chemogenetic and fiber photometry techniques, 2) become competent in designing,
analyzing, and interpreting studies and expand foundational research knowledge, and 3) obtain professional
development experience such as scientific communication and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) training.
The project will take place under the auspices of the Department of Psychiatry and the Neuroscience Graduate
Program at the University of Michigan. This vigorous research environment includes ample access to
behavioral testing facilities, animal housing, surgical equipment, histology and microscopy resources, and it
nurtures an expanding group of both basic and translational addiction researchers. The primary mentors are
Dr. Jonathan Morrow, who has expertise in Pavlovian conditioning paradigms and the study of individual
differences, Dr. Jill Becker, who brings many years of expertise in addiction neuroscience and rigorous study of
sex differences, Dr. Shelly Flagel, who has published extensively in Pavlovian conditioned and chemogenetic
approaches, and Dr. Christian Burgess, who has experience with fiber photometry methods. Dr. Daniel
Leventhal, who is an expert in machine learning and DeepLabCut software, will serve as an Other Significant
Contributor (OSC). The proposed research project focuses on shared mechanisms that can confer vulnerability
to addiction and commonly comorbid psychiatric disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder. This will be
achieved by using viral delivery of designer receptors to gain control over specific neural pathways involved in
both appetitive and aversive conditioning, as well as using fiber photometry to record from these pathways
during conditioning. Because psychiatric vulnerabilities differ among indivSjeiduals and between the sexes,
these experiments will be designed to examine the interplay between biological sex, functional activity in
specific neural circuits, and natural phenotypic variations in cue-driven learning. The proposed F31 project is
well-aligned with the missions of the NIH and NIDA. The project will train a promising scientist and help clarify
neurobiological pathways contributing to addiction and frequently co-occuring disorders, which is a significant
public health priority."
10936530,"Project Summary/Abstract
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is among the most prevalent, recurrent, and functionally debilitating of all
psychiatric disorders. The incidence of MDD rises sharply during adolescence, and individuals who have an
onset of MDD in adolescence tend to have a more chronic and severe course of depression than do those with
a later onset. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop effective approaches for early identification, prevention,
and intervention for MDD. Experiences of early life adversity (ELA), which affect over 40% of children, are a
strong predictor of MDD. Research suggests that one pathway by which ELA increases risk for MDD is through
alterations in the structural and functional development of frontolimbic regions implicated in stress reactivity
and regulation; however, the direction of these effects and how they unfold over time are not known. Moreover,
the biobehavioral mechanisms by which ELA influences neurodevelopment and risk for MDD are not well
understood. In this context, sleep disturbances is a significant risk factor for MDD across the lifespan and is an
underexplored pathway by which ELA might increase risk for MDD during adolescence. Sleep disturbances
tend to increase during adolescence due to a combination of normative biological and psychosocial changes;
indeed, over 70% of high-school students report getting insufficient sleep. Emerging research suggests that
adolescents with greater sleep disturbances have both attenuated white matter development in tracts that
connect frontolimbic regions and heightened frontolimbic reactivity to stress. The overlapping neurobiological
and health effects of ELA and sleep disturbances suggest that sleep disturbance is a critical pathway that links
ELA to frontolimbic alterations and increased risk for MDD. The proposed research addresses critical gaps in
the literature by examining the multivariate and longitudinal effects of ELA, sleep disturbances, and frontolimbic
connectivity during adolescence and how these factors predict risk for depression in young adulthood.
Leveraging data from a multimethod longitudinal study, the proposed project investigates sleep disturbances
as a pathway linking ELA with alterations in frontolimbic development and risk for MDD across adolescence
and young adulthood (9-20 years of age). The results of this project will not only increase our understanding of
the neurobiological mechanisms by which ELA relates to increased risk for MDD, but will also provide insight
into sleep disturbances as a potential target of intervention during adolescence to ameliorate the effects of
ELA. Moreover, the proposed training plan will enable the applicant to gain theoretical and methodological
expertise in studying the relations among ELA, sleep quality, frontolimbic development, and psychopathology
during adolescence, and to develop professional skills necessary to transition to an independent research
career. Stanford University, the institution at which the applicant will be training, has experts and resources
relevant to all domains of the proposal, making it an ideal training environment for the applicant."
10821043,"Project Summary
Inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) are a heterogeneous group of genetic diseases that lead to loss of vision and
often progress to blindness. As a group, IRDs are linked to over 280 genes and affect ~4.5 million people
worldwide. In all IRDs, the ultimate cause of vision loss is degeneration of light-sensing photoreceptor (PR) cells
and, in most cases, genetic correction is needed specifically in PRs. Genome editing using the CRISPR-Cas9
toolkit has the potential to correct mutations directly in the patient’s DNA. Unfortunately, lack of a safe, efficient
delivery vehicle to PRs is a major barrier to developing gene therapies for IRDs. Viral gene therapies for IRDs
are in clinical testing but they have limited cargo size and induce a strong immune response. Lipid nanoparticles
(LNPs) are the most clinically advanced, non-viral nucleic acid delivery vehicle. LNPs form a “bubble” composed
of different lipids (and other compounds) that envelop nucleic acids and provide robust and safe delivery in vivo.
To address this PR-specific delivery barrier, EnterX Biosciences is developing novel PR-specific LNPs to
deliver RNA-based gene editing components based on our best-in-class, proprietary lipid technology.
Recently, we demonstrated the first and only use of lipid-based delivery to transfect PRs with mRNA in vivo,
which was accomplished by attaching a small proprietary peptide targeting moiety to the LNP. Our novel,
proprietary ionizable lipid, NTRX-7, can also generate LNPs that deliver mRNA to PRs. Combining this novel
lipid chemistry and targeting peptide could enable gene editing in PRs. To improve PR-specific delivery of gene
editors, we have two major Aims: 1) investigate efficiency of gene editor delivery via LNPs using NTRX lipids
and a targeting peptide in PRs; and 2) deploy top LNP candidates to quantify gene editing efficiency and retinal
toxicity. These experiments will identify the top LNP candidate(s) capable of safe, efficient delivery of RNA gene
editing components for immediate follow up studies of gene editing in specific IRDs. In Aim 1, we will screen LNP
delivery of gene editors to PRs. First, in Aim 1A, we will use DNA barcoding to rapidly identify the most potent
derivatives of NTRX-7 LNPs and evaluate which LNPs have suitable delivery efficiency to PRs via subretinal
injection in mice. The most potent LNP formulations identified by barcoding will then be formulated with Cas9
mRNA and gRNA and injected subretinally. By sectioning and immunostaining Ai9 reporter mouse retinas, we
will assay the number of tdTomato+ PRs to determine the spatial extent of gene editing (successful editing will
“allow” tdTomato expression in Ai9 mice) and determine the most potent lipids. In Aim 1B, we will similarly test if
adding the peptide targeting moiety to the LNP surface can further improve gene editing efficacy and fine-tune
PR specificity. Finally, in Aim 2, the top LNP candidates from Aim 1 will be tested longitudinally for retinal toxicity
and to quantify PR genome editing in reporter Nrl-GFP mice (here, gene editing will knock out GFP expression).
Successfully completing these Aims sets the table for further testing in animal models for retinal diseases and
unlocks therapeutic development for a major, unmet health need as well as the clinical market for IRD therapies."

Tobacco use remains a high risk factor for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) resulting from exposure to
potent tobacco carcinogens including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) such as dibenzo[a,l]pyrene
(DB[a,l]P), benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) and tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNA) such as N’-nitrosonornicotine
(NNN). To assess effects of these carcinogens on oral mucosa, we developed a novel OSCC mouse model
using DB[a,l]P and its fjord region diol epoxide (DB[a,l]PDE). Importantly, we showed that dietary intervention
with freeze-dried black raspberries (BRB) powder inhibited carcinogen-induced DNA damage, mutagenesis and
carcinogenesis in the mouse oral cavity. We have also established that BRB reduce formation and/or enhance
repair of bulky adducts in vitro, but, the mechanisms by which BRB reduce DNA damage remain to be fully
elucidated. Considering the varied structures of DNA adducts, we will focus on BRB effects on the nucleotide
excision repair (NER) and base-excision repair (BER) enzymes. Based on the abundant phenolic compounds
in BRB e.g. anthocyanins, it is logical to propose that BRB help preserve the cellular redox poise, enhance redox
scavenging and thus function to prevent oxidative DNA damage; our data support this proposition. In addition
to their cytoprotective functions, a specific cellular reducing equivalent-NADPH-functions in reductive
biosynthetic reactions including conversion of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides (dNTPs) that are essential
components for DNA repair. Based on these data, we hypothesize that BRB reduce DNA damage (cf.
Scheme 1, Significance) in a multimodal fashion: 1) BRB enhance NER and BER function via preservation
of key substrates and cofactors i.e. dNTPs and Mg2+, while maintaining an optimal, non-oxidized environment
conducive to DNA repair; 2) BRB preserve the cellular redox status via efficient scavenging of reactive species
that can inhibit DNA repair enzymes thereby reducing oxidative DNA damage. The proposed mechanistic
studies entail two complementary, yet independent, Specific Aims: Aim 1A will investigate the effects of BRB
on repair (NER, BER) of covalent tobacco carcinogen-DNA adducts and 8-OXO-dG in primary human
oral keratinocyte cells that have been transfected with these adducts using our established assay. Aim
1B will determine the capacity of BRB to prevent oxidative damage in wild-type (OGG1+/+, a component
of BER enzymes) and knockout (OGG1-/-) MEF cells. Concurrent studies, applicable to both subaims, will
assess BRB effect on preservation of dNTP pools and key cellular redox poise parameters in a continuum of
validated cells ranging from primary human oral keratinocytes, oral leukoplakia and OSCC cells. Aim 2 will
determine for the first time the effects of local BRB delivery on formation of covalent DNA adducts and
8-OXO-dG in buccal cells of healthy smokers. The results could serve as the framework for future
chemopreventive trials for addicted smokers who are unable to quit as well as non- or former-smokers who are
exposed to environmental carcinogens."

INAEDIS proposes to develop a platform technology for rapid room temperature dehydration of vaccines and
biopharmaceutical formulations using ultra-fine droplet aerosols, eliminating the need for logistically challenging
cold chain infrastructure. Some 20% of pharmaceuticals ‒ around $35B in value ‒ are estimated to be damaged
by poor temperature control during transport alone, and the challenges of maintaining cold chain during storage
and handling only add to wastage and reduced efficacy. Alarmingly, cold chain breach has been implicated in
cases of vaccine-preventable disease or even adverse events following immunization. For example, one study
reported adverse events suffered by 7% of patients administered with temperature compromised vaccines, 13%
of which were considered serious. Freeze-drying of biological formulations, which is traditional in the production
of pharmaceuticals, introduces time-consuming (1-3 days of processing), poorly scalable, energy inefficient, and
expensive batch manufacturing. Alternative spray drying methods have been explored, though this technique
remains inefficient (0.1-1 g of inhalable particulate product out of 1 kg of liquid formulation), energy intense and
poses risk of product thermal damage due to applied high drying temperatures (100-200 °C). To mitigate the
consequences of poor vaccine access and vaccine failure on population immunization, there is a clear need for
thermal stabilization of the formulations enabling robust vaccine transport and storage solutions. INAEDIS has
developed a method of Rapid Room Temperature Aerosol Dehydration (RTAD), a scalable system for
continuous dehydration of liquid pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical formulations that provides thermal
stabilization of biological drugs and eliminates the need for a cold supply chain. INAEDIS’s process can generate
aerosols with droplets that are 100x smaller (0.2-10 μm) and yield 100x more inhalable particulate product (50-
300 g) from 1 kg of liquid than existing spray drying technologies, without applying heat for drying, which mitigates
the risk of damage of thermolabile biologicals and provides a significant reduction in energy requirements.
Preliminary studies conducted with a Top 10 Pharma company have demonstrated superiority of the system
over traditional spray dryers with respect to powder dissolution, protein aggregation, particle size and size
uniformity, and inhalability of biologic formulation. Internal studies have also exhibited a 5-10x improvement in
bacteriophage survival rate. For this Phase I, INAEDIS seeks to establish the efficacy, reliability, and applicability
of RTAD. Specific aims include: 1) Demonstrate platform capabilities of the laboratory-scale RTAD process for
three major classes of bioformulations, 2) Demonstrate powder performance and shelf-life stability of produced
dehydrated formulations, and 3) Improve yield and scale up processes to establish commercial viability of the
current laboratory scale, and ramp up production capacity to a pilot scale. This will position INAEDIS for Phase
II, during which the platform will be adapted and validated on a broader spectrum of commercially relevant
biopharmaceuticals and further scaled up to meet the needs of pilot customers in the pharmaceutical industry."

In recent years, health care systems and physicians have made concerted efforts to practice evidence-based
medicine and provide patients with the best available information when making choices about their medical
care. However, medical decisions are often complex with many uncertainties and potential outcomes to
consider, some beneficial and some adverse. A popular analytic method used to help identify best treatment
strategies while accounting for uncertainty is decision analysis, which typically involves computer modeling of a
treatment choice outlined in the form of a decision tree, which shows options and health outcomes that may
occur as a result of the choice made. Complex decision trees are evaluated via Monte Carlo microsimulation to
allow for variability in individual patient characteristics and trace a patient’s path through the tree; when the
microsimulation is repeated many times to simulate many individuals, it provides the probability of each
potential outcome resulting from the initial decision. From this probability distribution, quantitative measures
associated with each decision can be calculated such as life years, quality-adjusted life years (a generic
measure of disease burden), and others; furthermore, when costs are also incorporated, cost-effectiveness
analysis (CEA) can be performed to compute the incremental cost-effectiveness of each option. In this
proposal, we describe plans to add functionality to the mathematical modeling software Berkeley Madonna to
allow users to build decision trees and carry out Monte Carlo microsimulations and Markov cohort analysis.
Berkeley Madonna’s interface was designed to make mathematical modeling quick and easy for non-technical
users by using a simple syntax and graphical images to construct sophisticated differential equations. We will
leverage this easy-to-use interface to enable medical researchers to perform microsimulation with software that
is more user-friendly, transparent, powerful, and affordable than currently available options. In Aim 1, we
propose further development of our decision analysis user interface that allows users to graphically construct
decision trees and perform microsimulations. In this aim, in addition to optimizing tools and features for the
GUI, we will add CEA output reports and graphics, sensitivity analysis capabilities, and Markov cohort analysis
capabilities. We will create tutorials and a user guide as well as ready-made templates that provide users a
jumping off point for quickly making their own models. In Aim 2, we propose to optimize code for performance
on single CPUs, multiple CPUs, and GPUs. Analysis speed is important because large, complex models can
take weeks to months to run with currently available software, none of which harness the power of GPU
technology; successful completion of this aim would make Berkeley Madonna the fastest available software by
far for performing decision analysis microsimulations. Finally, we will carry out extensive beta testing.
Achievement of these goals will provide an easy-to-use, transparent, powerful, and affordable tool to
biomedical researchers, educators, and professionals, and positively impact scientific discovery."

Hypoparathyroidism is a rare disease that results from a deficiency or inability to make sufficient amounts of
parathyroid hormone (PTH). Untreated or inadequately treated hypoparathyroidism leads to clinically
significant mineral-related metabolic issues including hypocalcemia, which leads to heart arrhythmias, spasms
of the vocal cords, and seizures. Current management of the disease for the majority of patients consists of
supplemental doses of calcium and active vitamin D to manage the hypocalcemia. While this approach is
intended to maintain serum calcium, it does not correct the underlying PTH deficiency and the physiological
aspects of hypoparathyroidism can still occur. Moreover, supplementation is associated with long-term
complications from the use of supraphysiological doses of calcium in the absence of endogenous PTH
hormone, which contribute to renal function deterioration, kidney stones, soft tissue calcifications and
abnormalities in bone remodeling. Natpara (PTH 1-84), is approved by the FDA for a subset of
hypoparathyroidism patients, but only partially alleviates the need for vitamin supplementation due to its short
half-life, and some patients still must take >10 pills/day. Clinical trials have demonstrated that if PTH(1-34) is
dosed continuously via a pump in humans, it can mimic physiological levels of PTH to restore normal levels of
calcium, phosphorus and markers of bone turnover. However, a pump-mediated, continuous infusion of PTH
would be costly and inconvenient for patients. Extend Biosciences has developed a long-acting version of
PTH(1-34) (EXT608) that could be dosed once a week and achieve a prolonged pharmacokinetic profile that
approximates endogenous PTH levels. SBIR Phase II results showed that EXT608 is more efficacious than
native PTH, and based on the retention time in rat and NHP, EXT608 is projected to be dosed once-weekly in
humans. In our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers, the drug has been well tolerated with no
adverse events. The studies proposed in this direct to Phase II application will focus on a second clinical study
in healthy volunteers looking at the effect of multiple doses. We will begin a Phase 2 clinical trial to determine
safety and tolerability of EXT608 in patients following this study. This long-acting PTH(1-34) derivative will
provides a true replacement therapy to treat hypoparathyroidism that returns serum and urinary calcium and
phosphate to physiological levels that will significantly improve the quality of life for patients."

The proposed research is relevant to public health because corneal blindness is the 4th leading cause of
blindness globally and is often preventable with proper healthcare. Blindness arises due to damaged integrity of
the corneal epithelium as the result of physical, chemical, or thermal trauma and/or as a consequence of
diseases, surgery, or anti-cancer drugs. Regardless of the cause, disruption of the epithelial layer is extremely
painful due to the dense sensory nerve innervation, makes the eye vulnerable to infection, and can result in
blindness. Despite the widespread incidence and the array of medical problems associated with epithelial
damage, there are no FDA-approved drugs that promote corneal wound healing or epithelial homeostasis. It is
well-established that proteins of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family can induce cell proliferation, migration,
survival, and differentiation of epithelial cells. We are investigating the signaling axis of one of these proteins, c-
Met, and its cognate ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). c-Met activity can not only promote the wound
healing/re-epithelialization phenotypes stated previously but can also prevent transformation of keratocytes to
fibroblasts and promote neuronal growth. However, c-Met is limited for therapeutic reasons in that RTKs have
transient activation and are desensitized following ligand stimulation. We hypothesize that extending c-Met
receptor activity by disrupting its downregulation will help restore corneal homeostasis following
wounding. This hypothesis will be tested through the following aims: Aim 1: Determine if ubiquitylation of the c-
Met receptor limits its signaling in corneal epithelial cells in vitro. We hypothesize that inhibiting negative
regulation of c-Met signaling will prolong receptor activity and accelerate healing. We will test this by blocking c-
Met ubiquitylation in vitro by genetic knockout of CBL genes from immortalized human corneal epithelial cells
and measuring receptor phosphorylation, trafficking, in vitro wound healing, and cell migration and proliferation.
Aim 2: Determine effect of CBL knockout and c-Met activation in corneal wound healing murine models in vivo.
We hypothesize that HGF-induced c-Met signaling will not only aid in re-epithelialization, but also will decrease
fibrotic markers in the stromal layer and promote axonal outgrowth of corneal nerves. We will test this by using
corneal epithelial-specific, inducible CBL knockout murine models. We will wound the corneas and monitor gross
corneal morphology and homeostasis, re-epithelialization, fibrosis and inflammatory markers, and nerve
restoration. These studies are innovative because we will manipulate c-Met signaling regulation to extend
signaling and promote healing of all layers of the cornea. The proposed research is relevant to the National Eye
Institute’s mission of eliminating vision loss and improving quality of life through research."
10931672,"Diet plays an integral role in the physical, emotional, and general health of children and adolescents. The
consequences of poor diet during this critical time period are long-lasting, with nutritional status being a strong

technologically advanced dietary assessment tool specific to the U.S. pediatric population by creating the
Pediatric Food Intake System (P-FITS). P-FITS will integrate Viocare’s VioScreen technology with mobile
targeted 24-hour food group screeners to estimate usual dietary intakes in U.S. children ages 8-13 years. This
Phase II research study will develop and test the technical capabilities, usability, validity, and reliability of the
fully functional version of P-FITS."
10788424,"The increasing prevalence of obesity has been paralleled by a rise in the consumption of caloric sweeteners over the past five decades. All of the most common caloric sweeteners contain a significant proportion of fructose, including table sugar (sucrose), honey, and high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS). Although fructose has likely been part of the diet since the beginning of mankind, humans in the western world now consume more than ever recorded. It is imperative that we understand how fructose impacts our bodies and develop novel treatment strategies to prevent its complications. We and others have shown that moderate daily exposure to dietary fructose exacerbates the obesogenic effects of a high fat diet, however the mechanisms by which this occurs remain uncertain. Our preliminary data identify villous hypertrophy and enhanced lipid uptake in mice fed diets containing sucrose or HFCS. A metabolomic and biochemical analysis of the intestinal epithelium show that fructose 1-phosphate (F1P), the primary fructose metabolite, is increased after dietary fructose and reduces pyruvate kinase (PK) activity. Genetic and pharmacologic activation of PK reduces villous length and protects against diet-induced weight gain. Therefore, we hypothesize that fructose promotes villous hypertrophy and lipid uptake by acting as an inhibitor of the M2 isozyme of PK (PKM2) in the enterocyte, which can be prevented and reversed with PK activators. We will test this hypothesis using dietary and pharmacologic interventions in mice and intestinal organoids. In Aim 1, we will genetically and pharmacologically manipulate ketohexokinase, the enzyme that produces F1P from fructose, and PKM2 in the intestines of mice to interrogate their role as mediators of diet-induced obesity. In Aim 2, we will define the effects of PK activity on enterocyte lipid metabolism to elucidate the mechanistic link between dietary fructose and obesity. Together, these aims will change our fundamental understanding of how fructose alters intestinal metabolism, define the fructose/F1P/PKM2 axis as a metabolic mediator of lipid uptake, and provide pre-clinical evidence for PKM2 activators as a novel therapeutic modality to combat obesity."

CDC statistics estimate that autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects 1 in 36 children. ASD is characterized by
stereotyped behaviors, social difficulties, and sensory hypo- and hyper-sensitivity. Hyperacusis is an example of
this. Those with ASD more frequently suffer from auditory processing disorder and reduced hearing sensitivity
as well. Most with ASD experience chronic gastrointestinal issues associated with increased intestinal
permeability and microbial dysbiosis of the gut. Experimental studies in mouse models of ASD have
demonstrated that treatments targeting gut microbiota can mitigate behavioral differences and synaptic
alterations. Our preliminary findings demonstrate peripheral hearing dysfunction. Taken together, we
hypothesize that gut dysbiosis contributes to hearing impairment in ASD. This proposal tests whether
conventional gut microbiota can rescue hearing as well as social behaviors related to hearing. Specific aims
evaluate 1) the effects of fecal microbial transfer on hearing and pathological markers at the adult stage and 2)
the effects of microbiome shift in early life on hearing and related behaviors including ultrasonic vocalization and
responses thereof. Findings will increase understanding of the role of gut microbiome in auditory plasticity as
well as the role of hearing function in social behavioral differences characteristic of ASD. If beneficial, an
implication is that conventional gut microbiota may represent a translational therapy."
10788427,"Alcohol misuse affects millions of people, resulting in numerous deaths each year. People who are
resistant alcohol intoxication and sedation are more likely to consume high levels of alcohol (binge
drinking) and are at higher risk of developing alcohol use disorder. One mechanism underlying the
development of alcohol use disorder is neuronal plasticity, which involves the regulation of gene
expression. How chromatin-mediated gene regulation in GABAergic neurons contributes to alcohol-
induced sedation and tolerance is unknown. My preliminary data using Assay for Transposase-
Accessible Chromatin by sequencing (ATAC-seq) shows that the chromatin landscape in GABA
neurons is altered by alcohol exposure, particularly in genes associated with insulin receptor signaling.
I propose to investigate relevant neuronal pathways identified by ATAC-seq to evaluate how chromatin
remodeling affects alcohol sedation and tolerance. Further, my preliminary data indicate that alcohol
alters gene regulation in GABA neurons, especially in genes that play a role in the insulin receptor
pathway. Finally, I propose to identify GABA neuron subtypes and to develop genetic tools that allow
subtype-specific manipulation, which will then be used to investigate how GABA neuron subtypes are
involved in alcohol use disorders. These activities will identify potential therapeutic targets for alcohol
use disorders. While I have experience in single-neuron physiology, I require additional training to
become a successful independent investigator. Thus, my immediate career goals are to obtain
extramural funding and produce manuscripts to establish expertise in alcohol-related research. My
long-term career goals are to become an independent investigator and establish a successful research
program investigating the role of GABAergic neurons in alcohol use disorder. This proposal leverages
my previous training in single-neuron physiology and will provide extensive additional training in
Drosophila model systems, the mechanisms of alcohol abuse, and bioinformatic analysis. I anticipate
that each aim will produce at least two scientific manuscripts and will provide preliminary data for future
R01 applications. Therefore, completing the activities proposed here will enable my transition to an
independent principal investigator."
10783889,"Background: The United States is experiencing a crisis in mental health care, in which long-term shifts
towards the emergency department (ED) for psychiatric treatment have been exacerbated by the COVID-19
pandemic – reduced inpatient hospitalization capacity, delayed outpatient appointments, extended ED
boarding, and staffing shortages, combined with substantial growth in demand for mental health services (due
in part to pandemic-related increases in stress, depression, social isolation, and anxiety, and with differential
impacts on vulnerable populations). Data-driven approaches have not been widely applied to understand
mechanisms and predictors of ED utilization for psychiatric patients, or to optimize clinical decision-making to
improve patient outcomes. Research: In this study, I will conduct secondary data analysis of 141,431 ED visits
for psychiatric care in a large regional health system from 2017-2023, extracting and preparing over 5,000
patient characteristics from the electronic health record (diagnoses, labs, medications, procedures, visits, and
notes). Aim 1: I will create a transdiagnostic subtyping system, using latent class analysis, hierarchical density-
based clustering, and neural network autoencoders, to reliably categorize and track major trends in patient
populations receiving emergency psychiatric care. Aim 2: I will develop a suite of ensemble machine learning
models to predict ED length of stay, ED boarding duration, short-term ED re-admission, transfer to inpatient
hospitalization, and post-discharge adverse events (suicide attempt, overdose, or psychotic episode). Aim 3: I
will estimate a precision treatment rule, using targeted causal inference and ensemble machine learning, to
capture heterogeneous treatment effects for primary ED disposition decisions (inpatient hospitalization, partial
hospitalization / intensive outpatient program, or outpatient monitoring) on adverse psychiatric events.
Candidate's Career Development, Goals, and Environment: This proposal's research aims and the
candidate's career development will be supported by the extensive resources available at Massachusetts
General Hospital (MGH) and Harvard Medical School, as well as formal training, coursework, and mentorship

10783892,"7. Project Summary/Abstract
Complement may be activated in the peri-transplant period by insults such as ischemia reperfusion injury or
binding of preformed host-anti-graft antibodies as well as post-transplant by binding of de novo donor specific
antibody. In these settings, complement membrane attack complexes (MACs) are deposited on allograft
endothelial cells (ECs) which increases the capacity of graft ECs to activate alloreactive host T and NK cells,
providing a mechanistic link between such insults and an increased incidence and severity of T cell-mediated
rejection (TCMR) without overt EC damage. We have shown that MACs are internalized and initiate IL-1
synthesis, processing and secretion followed by IL-1-mediated autocrine/paracrine activation of human ECs. A
key component of this activation response is expression of IL-15/IL-15R complexes on the EC surface that
can be trans-presented to circulating lymphocytes. Blocking IL-15 trans-presentation reverses much of the
MAC-induced augmentation of EC alloimmunogenicity. We hypothesize that gene editing of graft ECs ex vivo
prior to transplant will reduce the severity of TCMR and prolong graft survival while still enabling the host
immune system to respond to and control graft infection. Here we propose to develop approaches to do so, but
preliminary data have revealed that the response of ECs to MAC and IL-1 is unexpectedly complex. Human
ECs transcribe multiple different versions of IL-15 mRNA and increase these transcripts in response to IFN- or
MAC/IL-1, but only MAC/IL-1 leads to surface expression. The MAC/IL-1 response requires activation and
nuclear uptake of NF-B, but NF-B appears to regulate IL-15 translation rather than transcription, possibly
mediated by miRNA. Furthermore, co-induction of IL-15R, rather than pre-existing copies of this protein, is
required for endogenous IL-15 surface expression. It is unknown if exogenous IL-15 can be trans-presented by
ECs. We need to better understand these pathways in order to exploit them therapeutically. In this R21, we will
identify and quantify the IL-15 mRNA species expressed by cultured human ECs that encode surface
expressed protein isoforms and elucidate the mechanism of their translational control (aim 1). We then
propose to optimize strategies for the elimination of MAC-induced IL-15 surface expression and trans-
presentation using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing and determine if and how this can be achieved using mRNA
transfection while preserving EC homeostatic functions (aim 2). We will use the results of these studies to
guide our future approach to gene edit human graft EC in ex vivo machine perfused organs."
10783919,"Project Summary/Abstract
Gabapentin, currently approved to treat partial seizures and postherpetic neuralgia, was
the 6th most commonly prescribed medication in the US in 2018. Notably, close to 95% of gabapentin
prescriptions are for off-label indications, such as neuropathic pain, migraines, substance use disorder, and
psychiatric symptoms. Gabapentin's widespread use may be driven by a belief that it is a safer drug than
opioids and antipsychotics. However, there is an increasing concern about the safety of gabapentin use, and
several studies have reported that gabapentin has the potential for misuse and abuse. In particular, although
gabapentin prescription has dramatically increased in older adults, our understanding of gabapentin use in this
population is limited. Due to gabapentin's known binding site, alpha-2-delta-1, which has a relationship with
calcium channel, NMDA receptor, and thrombospondin, it is possible that gabapentin could affect older adults'
cognition and motor functions. To fill in the research gap, this study proposes to assess longitudinal patterns of
gabapentin use in older adults and to estimate the risk of health-related outcomes associated with gabapentin
prescriptions using Medicare claims data and linked Rush Alzheimer Disease Center-Medicare data. Aim 1 will
determine the distinct patterns (e.g., duration of use, concurrent medications, history of medication prior to
gabapentin initiation) of gabapentin use and examine the factors, including demographics and medical history,
associated with each pattern. This aim will provide clinically relevant characteristics of gabapentin users to
further investigate. Aim 2 will examine the association of gabapentin use with health-related outcomes,
including falls, fractures, neurocognitive changes, hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and mortality.
These associations will be estimated marginal structural models by considering time-varying exposure patterns
and time-varying confounders, including concurrent use of other medications and medical history. This
proposal fits into the National Institute on Aging's special interest of research on pain, pain management, and
opioids in aging.
 Through completing this project, Dr. Oh will gain experience in real-world evidence studies and expand
her toolbox to serve her professional future as a neuro-pharmacoepidemiologist. Since medication use and its
effects is highly influenced by policy, this project will build Dr. Oh's knowledge of the process of translating
research into policy. Lastly, Dr. Oh will sharpen essential professional skills, such as grant writing, networking,
and mentoring. She will be guided by a strong interdisciplinary mentoring team with collective expertise in
neuroepidemiology, pharmacoepidemiology, health-related outcomes, policy, and biomedical informatics.
Findings from this study will help healthcare providers and policymakers better understand the risks and
benefits of prescribing gabapentin to older adults and will provide the baseline knowledge for further
investigation into establishing the causal relationship between gabapentin and health-related outcomes."
10788656,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
There is a critical need to identify new mechanisms and signaling pathways promoting diabetic kidney disease.
Intrarenal expression of renin and pro-renin are enhanced in diabetes and blockade of the renin angiotensin
system improves diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and kidney function. Pro-renin is elevated in plasma of patients
and mice with type-1 diabetes and plays a role in DKD, independently from its role in blood pressure. The main
source of the circulating renin and pro-renin are Juxtaglomerular Cells (JG cells) located in the afferent arteriole.
Pro-inflammatory cells infiltrate the diabetic kidney cortex, increasing the release of interleukins (IL). The specific
inflammatory cells and their localization in the cortex in diabetic mice is not clear. Our preliminary data shows an
increased number of T lymphocytes (Th17) in kidneys from diabetic mice. Our data also show that IL17 increases
renin release from JG cells and that receptors for IL17 (IL17-R) are enhanced in JG cells from diabetic mice
suggesting that this pathway could be in volved in activation of the kidney renin angiotensin system in diabetes.
In this exploratory grant we will identify new subpopulations of inflammatory cells in the renal cortex of diabetic
mice by single cell RNA seq and mass cytometry and study their localization in the juxtaglomerular area by
CyToF imaging. In addition, we will develop a triple transgenic diabetic mouse with specific deletion of IL17R in
JG cells to determine the role of this pathway in DKD."

Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) are produced as byproducts of oxidative phosphorylation and are found
to be elevated in most cancers. In order to prevent ROS mediated cellular toxicity, cancer cells upregulate
production of ROS detoxifying enzymes such as Glutathione Peroxidase 4 (GPx4). Essential to the catalytic
activity of GPx4 is a catalytic selenocysteine residue, incorporated through specific reprogramming of the
UGA-STOP codon by tRNA-selenocysteine (tRNASec). tRNASec requires chemical modification of its
anticodon by the tRNA methyltransferase AlkBH8 for proper recognition and decoding ability of the UGA
codon. Our preliminary data indicate that high levels of AlkBH8 are correlated with worse prognostic
outcomes in colorectal cancer and that loss of AlkBH8 induces a growth arrest and reduces tumor
forming ability in several colorectal cancer cell lines. However, at present almost nothing is known
regarding the role of AlkBH8 and its tRNA modification in cancer cell growth and survival. Therefore, the
studies proposed here are intended to fill a critical void in our understanding of tRNA modifications in
cancer. First, we will use an inducible knockdown model of AlkBH8 to investigate the mechanisms following
loss of AlkBH8 that lead to growth arrest and investigate whether this mechanism is conserved in in-vivo
xenograft models. Second, we will utilize in-vitro analysis of recombinant AlkBH8 in order to deconvolute
the contributions of each of its domains on its catalytic activity. The information generated through these
studies will seek to establish a novel therapeutic target in one of the most frequently diagnosed and
deadliest cancers across the world."

Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) is a form of stroke that strikes relatively young, working-age
individuals (typically 30-60 years old; mean age ~50 years old). Cognitive symptoms post-aSAH impair quality
of life (QoL), with disparities seen in African American (AA) patients, rural patients, and those individuals of
lower educational and socioeconomic status. Notably in our preliminary data, cognitive symptoms have gone
undiagnosed in ~67% of survivors, as these symptoms are not captured by typical outpatient clinical
neurological exams or commonly used general mental status screening modalities. Furthermore, the gold
standard of measuring post-aSAH cognitive impairments with neuropsychological testing is frequently
unavailable or neglected, and there are no existing guidelines regarding when to trigger such referral. But if
these changes are accurately detected and patients are referred, cognitive interventions have shown success
in improving outcomes in this population. In short, inadequate detection and phenotyping of cognitive
symptoms by clinical neurological exam and/or general mental status screening, in conjunction with non-
existent guidelines for in-depth assessment, places patients at risk for cognitively driven poor outcomes and
reduced QoL, a risk that is greater for AA and rural patients, but an outcome that is amenable to intervention.
The novel central hypothesis of this proposal is that the Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders (Neuro-
QoL), a patient-reported outcome (PRO) battery of questionnaires, can fill this gap in screening for clinical
decision-making. Our strong preliminary data demonstrate that the cognitive short form within the Neuro-QoL
(NQ-CSF) provides a simple yet critically needed screening tool for use in aSAH survivors; however, this
instrument has not yet been tested a) as a benchmark to trigger individual patient referral for in-depth
neuropsychological assessment; b) for interpretation in relation to other relevant demographic and clinical
information; or c) for interpretation in relation to other Neuro-QoL measures. Furthermore, responses on this
instrument have not been considered in regard to social determinants of health (SDOH) data that may impact
reporting and interpretation or create enhanced screening needs for diverse groups of patients. We respond
here to PA-19-053 and NOT-OD-20-079, and the spirit of PAR-22-231, to propose one highly focused aim:
Determine the utility of the Neuro-QoL cognition short form (NQ-CSF) as a benchmark to trigger
individual patient referral for in-depth clinical neuropsychological assessment. This project is
innovative for applying the Neuro-QoL for clinically meaningful cognitive symptom screening and
individualized patient referral post-aSAH. The work will have a significant impact by informing new practice
guidelines to improve equity and to provide earlier and more accurate assessment of cognitive
symptomatology. Lack of such knowledge reduces QoL for these individuals."

Human enterovirus (HEV) infections primarily affect infant and adolescent populations, causing a
wide range of clinical manifestations that commonly include respiratory illness and
mucocutaneous lesions, or hand, foot and mouth disease. In some cases, the infection is life-
threatening. The clinical manifestations are a function of their tropism. For example, some HEVs,
including EV-A71 and EV-D68, are associated with serious neurological symptoms due to
invasion and damage of central nervous tissues. Others, such CVB3, are implicated in respiratory
symptoms and cardiomyopathy. This proposal aims to take an integrative approach to understand
how tissues, and cells within these tissues, respond to infection by CVB3 and the emerging
pathogens EV-D68 and EV-A71. We will determine the temporal and spatial dynamics of HEV
infection using recent advances in genomics: (i) We will profile single-cell transcriptomes to
quantify viral replication levels and the host response to infection across cells and tissues over
the course of infection. (ii) Given that intra-host adaptation appears to be important in infection,
in parallel, we will map the mutational spectrum of the replicating viruses using a novel ultra-deep
sequencing approach. We will use new innovative technologies, such as ultra-deep virus
population sequencing, deep learning and single-cell analysis to increase our basic understanding
of the pathogenesis of enteroviruses A, B and D. Finally, given that innate immunity is a major
determinant of tissue tropism, we will use mice with deletions of specific type-I IFN subtypes to
determine the significance of interferon diversity in controlling HEV infections. These data will
enable us to determine cell types that HEVs infect, the response that the host mounts against
them in each cell and tissue, and the viral mutants that emerge in different tissues. Understanding
pathogenesis is critically needed for developing effective and broadly-acting countermeasures
and to inform the development of effective and broad-spectrum vaccines and antiviral

The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a target for non-invasive brain stimulation for the treatment of substance use
disorders (SUDs). Due to its location deep in the brain, transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) is unique
among non-invasive brain stimulation methods to be able to focus on the NAc with high spatial resolution.
TUS has been shown to be effective in animal models, without any evidence of damage from either behavioral
studies, H&E stained sections, or TUNEL staining. Further, there have been millions of diagnostic imaging
studies at the pressures proposed for TUS, that have appeared to be safe. As a result, it is currently under
active investigation in humans.
However, when it comes to safety, we are compelled to examine all existing data. In particular, we have
existing data from our prior studies in which we applied TUS to the sheep brain and examined it on H&E
stained sections, as well as TUNEL staining. Here in this proposal, we seek to extend this analysis to the
examination of inflammatory cytokines and the examination of glial cells using immunohistochemistry. These
studies will give us a more complete picture whether TUS has an inflammatory effect on the brain."
10789672,"SUMMARY. The number of Americans over age 65 years is growing and is projected to increase from
approximately 39 million in 2010 to an estimated 71 million in 2030. The prevalence of multi-morbidity, including
cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's dementia, emphysema, and diabetes increases significantly with age. One
of the best validated molecular fingerprints of aging and senescence is the protein plasminogen activatorinhibitor-
1 (PAI-1) (the protein product of the gene SERPINE1). A remarkably robust and consistent body of experimental
evidence generated by laboratories from around the world have identified a mechanistic link between PAI-1 and
aging-like pathology in every major organ system, including the heart, kidney and skin among others. In healthy
human populations, higher levels of PAI-1 are associated with coronary artery disease, increased vascular
stiffness, obesity, diabetes, fatty liver disease, and emphysema/obstructive lung disease. Conversely, PAI-1
deficiency and/or pharmacological inhibition of PAI-1 provides substantial protection against aging-like
cardiovascular pathology in mice. The protective effect of PAI-1 deficiency on biological aging appears to be
operational in humans. In a geographically and genetically constrained community of Old Order Amish, a
remarkable “natural” experiment has been underway for 8 generations. This community harbors a private loss-
of-function (LOF) mutation in SERPINE1, that can be traced back to a single ancestor that married into the
community in the late part of the 19th century. Heterozygous carriers of the null mutation in SERPINE1 have
longer telomeres, lower fasting insulin levels, protection from diabetes, preserved vascular flexibility, and a longer
life span than their unaffected kindred. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that lifelong PAI-1 deficiency
provides multifaceted protection against cardiovascular aging. This application is designed to investigate the
pleiotropic effects of PAI-1 on cardiovascular resilience and aging and reveal the molecular mechanisms that
explain these effects. These studies will leverage the only known kindred in the world with a naturally occurring
loss-of-function variants in PAI-1 with experimental studies in mice and in iPSC-derived vascular cells to translate
the generalizability of these findings. We anticipate that the studies proposed here will advance our
understanding of the pivotal role of PAI-1 in aging-related cardiovascular disease, the molecular mechanisms
that explain this relationship, and provide proof of principle that pharmacological inhibition of PAI-1 is a rational
therapeutic approach in preventing aging-related cardiovascular morbidity in humans."

10792913,"PROJECT SUMMARY – DEVELOPMENTAL CORE
The JHU NIMH Center Developmental Core was established to promote innovative, high-risk, high-impact
NeuroHIV research through the use of Pilot Project Grants. Through the lifecycle of the Developmental Core, 46
pilot projects have funded this type of research. Awardees subsequently published 137 articles directly linked to
their pilot funding and obtained over $18 million dollars in subsequent follow-up awards. To align with the
Center’s priorities of developing therapeutics for the CNS complications in PWH and to enhance workforce
development, we propose the implementation of three new initiatives: 1) establish an online pilot grant dashboard
to broaden reviewer participation and career development monitoring; 2) initiate a microgrant funding program
to fund cutting-edge technological advances and latest developments in the NeuroHIV field; and 3) initiate a
community science education program and a community engagement speaker series to foster the development
of scientists who can talk about the significance of their research in a manner that educates, engages, and offers
opportunity for participation from members in our HIV community. While most recent data shows that progress
is being made in providing support to early stage and new investigators as they advance in their careers to
independent investigators, there continues to be a need for directed mitigation strategies for women and
underrepresented minority trainees. With these new initiatives as well as close collaboration with the Clinical
Core, we expect to over the next five years to strengthen the pilot grant administration process, enhance one-
to-one mentoring and opportunities for collaboration between NIMH Centers on novel drug development
targeting CNS complication in virally suppressed people with HIV."
10792915,"PROJECT SUMMARY - BIOMARKER CORE
The JHU Center for the Advancement of HIV Neurotherapeutics (JHU CAHN) will focus on a CNS complications
that commonly present in PWH based on the framework of the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) that
classifies CNS complications based on dimensions of observable behavior and neurobiological measures that
include Negative and Positive Valence Systems (e.g., anhedonia, fear), Sensorimotor Systems, Systems for
Social Processes (e.g., social avoidance), Arousal/Regulatory Systems (e.g., sleep), and cognition. This
framework provides new opportunities to more accurately associate biomarkers with particular symptomology
with the goal of identifying molecular targets for the development of personalized medicine approaches by the
Therapeutics and Clinical Cores. The Biomarker Core will work closely with the Therapeutic and Clinical cores
to integrate multi-dimensional data and tools such as machine learning algorithms and offer these services to
investigators interested in NeuroHIV. Technical services will include mass spectrometry analysis for metabolites,
lipids, and proteins, multiplex Meso Scale discovery assays, extracellular vesicle isolation and cargo
characterization. Informatics analyses offered will include Small Molecules Pathway Database, Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, Cytoscape, and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Advanced non-parametric
analyses will include a variety of multivariate modeling such as principal component analysis (PCA), partial least
squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and sparse PLS-DA analysis, Significance analysis of metabolites
(SAM), and Empirical Bayesian analysis of metabolites (EBAM) models to identify features that discriminate
clinical biotypes or experimental groups. These services will be communicated broadly to the NeuroHIV
community through our multicenter weekly seminar series. These services are unique to the JHU CAHN, and
provide a valuable resource to NeuroHIV investigators at all stages of career development."
10792917,"PROJECT SUMMARY – THERAPEUTIC CORE
The multiple CNS comorbidities present in HIV-infected individuals necessitate a more holistic approach in
advancing new HIV neurotherapeutics. In line with these challenges, the JHU Center for the Advancement
of HIV Neurotherapeutics (JHU CAHN) will evolve into a comprehensive research center targeting all aspects
of CNS complications associated with PWH. The main objective of the Therapeutic Core is to serve as a
dedicated drug discovery unit and to develop new therapeutics by working closely with other JHU CAHN
cores as well as reaching out to investigators both in and outside the field of NeuroHIV including those
affiliated with other NIMH NeuroHIV centers and the industrial sector. This ambitious goal will be enabled by
a highly experienced drug discovery staff overseeing four key functions established within the Therapeutic
Core, namely, medicinal chemistry, assay development/screening, drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics,
and animal pharmacology/toxicology. The collective drug discovery-related resources will be directed toward
investigators involved in NeuroHIV translational research, with a focus on early-stage investigators, under-
represented minorities, and investigators new to HIV. The multidisciplinary structure tailored to drug
discovery research also allows the core to provide a wide range of drug discovery training and educational
opportunities (e.g., internships, fellowships, post-baccalaureate and graduate training, drug discovery and
translational courses). Furthermore, the Therapeutic Core is uniquely positioned to promote awareness of
HIV-related CNS complications among the industry sector by taking advantage of core’s extensive network
built over years through multiple academic-biopharma partnerships. Working closely with the centers’
Biomarker, Clinical, and Developmental cores, the Therapeutic Core is poised to seize this opportunity by
executing the following three Specific Aims: (Objective 1) Establish a drug discovery platform to develop
novel therapeutics for CNS complications in PWH; (Objective 2) Evaluate drugs from Objective 1 for effect
on neurobehavioral phenotypes in murine models of HIV; (Objective 3) Provide drug discovery education
and services to the academic community. Engage with biopharma to investigate novel therapeutics for HIV
comorbidities."
10792918,"PROJECT SUMMARY – CLINICAL CORE
Over the past 15 years, the Johns Hopkins (JH) NIMH P30 Center focused on furthering discovery and
application of novel therapeutics to address HIV-associated Cognitive Disorders, and successfully advanced
NeuroHIV research globally. During this time, the Clinical Core has grown and maintained longitudinal
participation of a well-characterized cohort of people with HIV (PWH) and matched HIV-uninfected individuals,
and successfully disseminated richly phenotyped clinical and behavioral data, biospecimens, and analytical
expertise to over 50 NIH-funded studies, including a 24 week Phase I/II pilot trial of intranasal insulin for the
treatment of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder. From these valuable human data, we gained crucial
insights into the heterogeneity of central nervous system (CNS) system dysfunction that manifests as varied
cognitive impairments as well as affective (mood including anhedonia, social withdrawal & anxiety) symptoms
and somatic symptoms (sleep), along with divergent patterns in cognitive treatment response. We also learned
that 24 weeks of intranasal insulin vs. placebo improved memory and attention in PWH. In response, our group
was early to pivot toward a new model of innovation in therapeutic development, namely a personalized medicine
approach developing and disseminating algorithmic, patient data-driven approaches to best select therapeutic
targets and predict individual treatment response in PWH. In 2017, the Core moved toward mentoring rising
leaders in big data harmonization and machine learning, broadening the clinical data collection to capture
behavioral and self-report metrics relevant to mood and anxiety symptoms, integrating brain measurements, and
incorporating assessments of genetic endowment, maladaptive behaviors, and life experience. Through this
effort, the Clinical Core was among the first to capitalize on the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC)
framework in the NeuroHIV field, an approach that will facilitate precision medicine approaches to treating
neuropsychiatric complications in PWH. Over the next five years, the Clinical Core will collaborate with other JH
Cores and those outside our Center to continue to innovate as a critical resource in the NeuroHIV field.
Specifically, the Clinical Core will support projects in target discovery, therapeutic development, and clinical trials.
In the context of this framework, we aim to: 1) Establish a resource to provide richly phenotyped clinical data, to
support the study of critical pathways/circuits underlying CNS dysfunction, and inform therapeutic development
and application in PWH, 2) Provide consulting services to the academic NeuroHIV community in terms of RDoC
implementation, 3) Mentor the next generation of NeuroHIV scientists with integration of the RDoC framework,
and 4) Engage and educate the community of PWH through multiple outreach programs."

Cardiovascular (CV) disease is a significant competing cause of death for many survivors of common
early-stage cancers. Up to 90% of survivors have multiple CV risk factors, and many receive cancer
therapies with potentially cardiotoxic side effects. Yet cardiovascular health (CVH) is rarely addressed
during routine post-treatment survivorship care. CVH assessment could increase patient and provider
awareness of CVH and treatment-related cardiotoxicity risk, and promote CVH and cardiotoxicity
management during survivorship care, thereby reducing CV disease and cancer recurrence. Such an
assessment may be especially critical for the 20% of survivors who do not have a primary care provider

research team developed an automated
health record (EHR)-based CVH assessment tool, deployed it in a primary care setting, and
adapted it for use with cancer survivors. Here we propose to implement and evaluate this
tool, called the Automated Heart Health Application (AH-HA), among survivors in the NCI
Oncology Research Program (NCORP) network. Evaluations in our pilot indicated high
and acceptability among oncology providers and survivors. AH-HA incorporates traditional CV risk
and potentially cardiotoxic cancer treatment data, and can be easily implemented into routine
practice. Thus, we propose a mixed methods, hybrid effectiveness-implementation study to
the effects of the AH-HA tool among survivors of breast, prostate, colorectal, and endometrial
who are now in survivorship care.Our central hypothesis is that the AH-HA tool will increase (1)
CVH awareness and discussions among patients and oncology providers, (2) appropriate referrals and
visits to primary care and cardiology, and (3) CV risk reduction and health promotion activities compared to
usual care. We seek to speed translation of the AH-HA tool into practice by simultaneously collecting
mixed method process data regarding current and future implementation, guided by the Reach, Efficacy,
Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework. Our Specific Aims are to: (1) Assess
the impact of the AH-HA tool on providers' efforts to discuss CVH, refer survivors to primary care and
cardiology, and manage CV risk; (2) Measure the impact of the AH-HA tool on survivors' completed
primary care and cardiology visits and CVH; and (3) Examine factors influencing current and future
implementation of the AH-HA tool. The results of our proposed study will guide future dissemination efforts,
with the ultimate goal of improving CVH among the rapidly growing population of cancer survivors. Use of
the established NCORP network is efficient and provides an excellent opportunity to test our intervention in
community oncology settings, where most cancer survivors receive care."
10810644,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Vascular calcification (VC) frequently complicates cardiovascular disease. It increases the morbidity and
mortality and constitutes a significant obstacle in interventions and surgeries. The vascular endothelium plays
an important role in VC. The intimal (luminal) endothelial cells (ECs) contribute to VC by providing
osteoprogenitor cells through endothelial-mesenchymal transitions (EndMTs). The adventitial ECs are known
to contribute to neo-angiogenesis in diseased vascular wall, but it is unknown whether such ECs support VC
and what defines them. A subset of ECs with high expression of the EC marker CD31 and the glycoprotein
Endomucin (Emcn) has been found in bone to support bone formation. It is possible that adventitial or other
peripheral ECs are recruited to diseased areas to promote calcification. Preliminary experiments, using the
Matrix Gla Protein null (Mgp-/-) mouse as a VC model, showed extensive EC involvement in the calcified aorta.
We identified two subtypes of ECs in the adventitial vs. the intimal endothelium (referred to as a-ECs and i-
ECs). The a-ECs were CD31+Emcm+ and correlated with the severity of the VC, whereas the i-ECs were
CD31+Emcn-. The two ECs had distinct transcriptional profiles with stem cell and osteogenic markers in the i-
ECs vs. enhanced Notch expression in the a-ECs. Endothelial deletion of Notch1 reduced the a-ECs and
limited VC while promoting cartilage formation and survival in the Mgp-/- mice. The bone transcription factor
Osterix was expressed in both types of ECs. We hypothesize that a-ECs are distinct from i-ECs, recruited to
nascent VC, and susceptible to Notch disruption. We also hypothesize that Osterix is protective of EC lineage.
In Aim 1, we will characterize the a-ECs (CD31+Emcn+) and compare to the i-ECs (CD31+Emcn-) in the Mgp-/-
model, and correlate with severity of VC and marker expression. We will identify unique markers for the
respective ECs, with comparison to bone, using transcriptional profiles from single cell RNA sequencing
(scRNAseq). We will test the concept that angiogenesis is required for VC using angiogenic inhibitors. In Aim
2, we will determine the effect of loss or gain of endothelial Notch signaling on the EC subtypes and VC. We
will examine the distribution of Notch components in relation to VC, and generate Mgp-/- mice with endothelial-
specific loss of Notch1 or the Notch receptor inactivator Fbxw7. We will use the mice to determine the effect on
the appearance of the endothelial subtypes, calcification and transcriptional profiles by scRNAseq. We will also
apply loss and gain of Notch to ECs in vitro and identify novel Notch targets and networks. In Aim 3, we will
determine if Osterix helps maintain EC lineage or promotes calcification in vitro and in vivo using human aortic
ECs and inducible endothelial-specific Osterix gene deletion in Mgp-/- mice. We will compare the transcriptional
profiles of ECs with and without Osterix by scRNAseq in order to clarify the effect on EC lineage, a-ECs vc. I-
ECs, and involved signaling networks. Our results may have a significant impact on the field of VC, in
particular on the understanding of the endothelial pathology and involvement in VC."
10810646,"This is the renewal application of a grant that has been supported as part of the NHLBI Systems Biology program.
It deals with the subject of glycosylation, a ubiquitous and complex post-translational modification in mammalian
cells. Glycans decorate a vast majority of mammalian proteins. They absolutely control or fine-tune a number of
cellular processes in higher organisms including development, immunity, inflammation, bleeding and metastasis.
Glycan structures change due to alterations in cell metabolism, development and signaling events that perturb
the underlying transcriptome. A systematic understanding of the factors (genetic and epigenetic) controlling
glycosylation is currently unavailable. This is however important for two reasons: i. Such knowledge can help
establish quantitative links between different cell systems, so that knowledge gained in the study of one system
can be applied to predict the outcome in another. ii. Gene transcript measurements are now being used in clinical
diagnostics, and the advent of next generation sequencing (NGS) has dramatically reduced the cost of such
assays. If a relation between changes in the pattern of gene expression and alterations in glycan structures is
established, disease-associated glycan biomarkers may be assayed using standard gene sequencing methods.
This can enable both early diagnosis and patient stratification during precision medicine applications. Based on
the above, the current proposal addresses the hypothesis that “Coupling systems based quantitative,
analytical experimentation with model building can help relate cellular glycomics changes to the
underlying transcriptome”. This proposition will be tested by performing a series of studies using blood
leukocytes involved in innate immunity and by relating findings to inflammatory leukocyte-endothelial cell
adhesion mechanics. The specific aims are: 1. To develop a blood glycan atlas using single-cell analysis on
NGS platform and glycoProbe based mass spectrometry. This aim will result in a relational database that
describes the glycoEnzymes regulating the biosynthesis of specific glycan structures in three myeloid/monocytic
blood cell lines, primary human blood and in CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC). 2: To develop
a complementary experiment-modeling framework to relate glycogene expression to glycan structure. This aim
extends concepts in Aim 1, only focusing on blood cells that are being differentiated down neutrophil or
macrophage lineages. Emerging data will yield glycogene regulatory network maps that identify novel controllers
of cellular glycosylation profile. 3: To test the roles of selected small molecules, transcription factors (TFs) &
glycogene checkpoints during leukocyte-endothelial cell adhesion ex vivo and in vivo. Here, we determine the
ability of data-driven computer predictions and molecular studies, to identify new checkpoints regulating human
inflammatory leukocyte adhesion. Overall, the study scales from the molecular, to cell and whole animal levels.
It will result in state-of-the-art systems biology computational and experimental tools to enhance our
understanding of cellular glycosylation, blood glycans, and its impact on human inflammatory diseases."
10810769,"Abstract
The long term goal of this proposal is to quantitatively understand how gene regulatory networks (GRNs)
generate the diversity of cell types during the development of the human brain. The focus of this proposal is to
determine how key progenitor cell types that are uniquely enriched in humans are generated. Such an
understanding is essential for uncovering the mechanisms of human developmental diseases. There are three
challenges to achieving this goal: 1. Ethical issues in working with developing human tissue, 2. Computational
and experimental techniques to determine the sequence of progenitor cell states and state transitions that give
rise to the diversity of cell types, 3. the difficultly in building quantitative models of the gene regulatory networks
in the absence of data to determine the thousands of biochemical constants. The approach of the proposal is to
build the necessary computational, mathematical and experimental framework to overcome these challenges.
To recapitulate early human brain development, the proposal will employ an in vitro human embryonic stem cell
differentiation system. To obtain snapshots of the underlying gene regulatory network, high throughput single
cell sequencing will be employed to obtain transcriptional profiles of thousands of single cells during the course
of development. The challenge of inferring the sequence of cell states and cell state transitions will be overcome
through a novel statistical method to obtain a joint probability distribution of the cell states, sequence of transitions
and a key set of genes whose dynamics reflect these states and transitions. The inferences will be tested by
mapping to in vivo data and using viral lineage tracing. The origins of forebrain and outer radial glial cells (oRG)
progenitors uniquely enriched in the developing human forebrain will thus be determined.
The challenge of building predictive models will be overcome by using methods from theoretical physics and
ensemble modeling from statistics to build models that make probabilistic predictions. By using the available
data as constraints on the model, the framework will extract joint probability distributions of all the parameters of
the model. These distribution functions will then be used to produce probabilistic predictions about the responses
of the underlying GRNs to perturbations. High probability predictions will be tested experimentally by perturbing
gene expression and signaling during early brain development and the model will be iteratively improved. The
success of this proposal will result in the first quantitative model of the gene regulatory network controlling the
generation of forebrain and the oRG progenitor cells. If achieved, this work therefore would represent a major
insight into the molecular and cellular events that give rise to the disproportionately gyrated human brain."
10812167,"Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)-associated heart failure is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. About a third
of DCM is due to gene variants in a broad range of cardiac muscle proteins. Although this information has
improved patient management, it has not yet led to new therapeutics that target the underlying mechanisms of
disease. A major roadblock is that the consequences of the DCM-causing mutations are not understood in
sufficient detail to identify points of therapeutic intervention. During the first funding cycle of this project, we used
large-scale screening of synthetic microRNAs as an entry point to discover genes that, when inhibited, restored
contractility of induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-CMs) carrying DCM-causing mutations. We identified two
synthetic microRNAs that normalized contractility of DCM cardiomyocytes comparable to CRISPR-correction of
the underlying mutation. Neither microRNA affected isogenic, control hiPSC-CMs, indicating that they act on
disease-related processes. We biochemically identified their targets, identifying 203 genes, of which individual
siRNA-mediated inhibition of 117 restored contractility of TNNT2 mutant DCM mutant hiPSC-CMs from different
patient donors. While some of the candidate genes have been tested as therapeutic targets in heart failure, the
vast majority represent new therapeutic target space for inherited DCM.
This is multi-PI renewal application is to determine the mechanisms of action of these genes and to establish
evidence of disease modifying activity using human genetics and a mouse DCM model. The multi-PI and co-I
team unites expertise in iPSC and animal models, systems biology, and human genetics that will have a
synergistic impact on our long-term goal of defining therapeutic mechanisms for DCM that would not be possible
through separate proposals.
Given the diverse genetics and clinical presentations of inherited DCM, our overarching hypothesis is that
subsets of the candidate genes, and the physiological processes they affect, will revert contractile dysfunction
in a DCM mutation-specific manner. Thus, Aim 1 is to define mechanisms that restore contractile function in
DCM caused by different gene variants, and associate beneficial molecular genetic and metabolic pathways with
particular DCM-causing mutations, Aim 2 is to investigate whether genetic variants linked to each of the miR-
target genes associate with human cardiovascular diseases or quantitative traits using existing GWAS studies,
and Aim 3 is to test whether targets of a microRNA that selectively ameliorates contractility in TNNT2-mutant
hiPSC-CMs converge on ER stress using a mouse knock-in model engineered with the same Tnnt2 mutation as
in the patient hiPSCs."

 African Americans (AAs) are disproportionately affected by cardiovascular disease (CVD) and obesity. AA
vegetarians/vegans have significantly lower risks of hypertension and diabetes as compared to AA omnivores.
Vegan soul food restaurants have emerged as a potential community partner for introducing patrons to healthy
versions of familiar soul food cuisine. To explore the potential impact of this intervention on AAs with
overweight or obesity who were not already following vegan diets, we conducted the Nutritious Eating with
Soul intervention (NEW Soul; R01HL135220), delivered in a university setting in Columbia, SC (n=159 AAs;
vegan vs. low-fat omnivorous diet, both focused on soul food). We completed 3-month assessments with high
retention rates (88%) and significant weight loss (vegan -2.2±2.8 kgs; omnivorous -1.2±2.7 kgs; p=0.03).
 We propose to examine the effectiveness and implementation of a remotely-delivered, 3-month NEW Soul
program. We will work with two vegan soul food restaurants (see letters of support). We have the following
aims:
Aim 1: Evaluate the effectiveness of the 3-month NEW Soul restaurant-delivered program on two important
factors in the development of CVD (body weight and diet quality) among AAs with overweight or obesity.
Participants (n=228) will be randomized to one of two conditions: 1. Remotely delivered live weekly classes
with restaurant vouchers (intervention) or 2. restaurant voucher-only (active control).
Aim 2: Conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of delivering the online intervention plus voucher vs. voucher-
only with the outcome of cost/change in weight, HEI and quality adjusted life year (QALY). This includes
estimating costs of the intervention itself (e.g., training, delivery, infrastructure).
Aim 3a: Examine the implementation of the NEW Soul study. Guided by the implementation outcome
framework by Proctor, et. al., and the implementation strategies described by Waltz, et. al., we will examine the
feasibility and utility of the NEW Soul implementation strategies (e.g., provide iterative assistance, provide
ongoing training and consultation, centralize technical assistance) in restaurant settings. We will employ
qualitative (semi-structured interviews with intervention staff and focus groups with participants), and
quantitative (surveys with participants) research methods, which will be guided by CFIR domains (intervention
characteristics, inner setting, outer setting, characteristics of individuals, and process).
Aim 3b: Building on the findings from Aims 1-3a, we will conduct key informant interviews with intervention and
restaurant staff to identify areas to prepare the intervention for widespread adoption by vegan soul food
restaurants across the southeast. We will focus on the design quality and packaging, part of the CFIR
“intervention characteristics” domain."

The staging and pacing of neurodevelopmental change during adolescence exhibits observable individual
differences, yet how much of this between- and within-subject variation is attributable to genetic factors is
unknown. Current understanding of the genetic basis for brain structure and function measured by
neuroimaging data is based on analyses of (mostly cross-sectional) adult samples. By obtaining results from a
developmentally-critical period, i.e. adolescence, we will be able to determine whether the identified genetic
components are time-invariant traits or time-sensitive developmental results. Our long-term goal is to
determine the causal mechanisms underlying vulnerabilities to risky behavior and psychiatric disorders that
emerge during adolescence. To achieve this goal, we aim to search for genetic factors associated with
developmental variation measured by multi-modal neuroimaging data. We propose three approaches to
perform unbiased genetic analyses of data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)
study: 1) Extract patterns of developmental changes across brain regions; 2) Identify associated genetic loci
through integrated genome-wide association studies across derived developmental multi-modal imaging
phenotypes; 3) Determine the relationship between genetic risk for psychiatric diseases and
neurodevelopmental trajectories. We will pursue these aims utilizing a novel combination of methods from
population genetics and neuroscience while innovatively tailoring the analytic strategies to avoid potential
biases and spurious associations due to admixture and relatedness. The proposed research is significant
because the identified genetic mechanisms will provide a potential basis for therapeutics and public health
interventions, attending to the impact of the epidemiologically guided sampling of ABCD data. By sharing the
tools we develop in this research program and the resulting genetic instruments, we will impact the field
immediately, enabling researchers to more deeply investigate neurodevelopmental processes with ABCD data
as well as with other accumulating datasets to which they have access."
10934575,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 African American men have the highest rate of hypertension (HTN) in the United States. Once diagnosed,
they are also less likely to achieve blood pressure (BP) control. This health disparity is critical, as elevated BP is
the primary modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease. One reason for this HTN disparity: stress. African
Americans report more stress than their White peers, most notably from racial discrimination, and have fewer
resources to manage these stressors. And this stress has significant physiological consequences. Compared to
Whites, African Americans show heightened allostatic load, a biologic measure of the cumulative burden of
chronic stress that is implicated in the etiology of HTN. Stress also exacerbates HTN through unhealthy coping
(e.g., overeating, alcohol use) and poorer adherence to antihypertensive medications.
 Research shows that stress management (SM) interventions improve HTN. Despite this, SM training is not
regularly deployed to manage BP, often because health care settings lack the resources to deliver it. One cost-
effective, easily scalable solution is mobile phones (i.e., mHealth). Importantly, 98% of African Americans own
a mobile phone. Most are smartphones (83%). And text messaging interventions have been shown to improve a
variety of HTN management lifestyle changes (e.g., smoking reduction, physical activity enhancement).
 There is no mobile cognitive behavioral SM intervention (m-CBSMi) on the market today that is designed
to help African American men manage racial and nonracial sources of stress in an effort to reduce HTN
disparities. The proposed intervention will fill this void. Using proven CBSMi techniques, Black men will learn
how to manage stress and reduce BP through text messages and integrated videos. Educational texts will
increase knowledge, develop skills, and reduce barriers to adaptive coping. Supportive texts will promote
gender and ethnic pride. A library of interactive videos will allow a user to choose tailored training and content
based on his personal needs and experiences (e.g., utilizing a choose-your-own-adventure style). All videos will
be accessible through links embedded within text messages, making it effortless to view them.
 In Phase I, a prototype m-CBSMI was developed. This development was informed by formative research
with 20 African American men across the lifespan. The results of Phase I strongly support the feasibility and
potential effectiveness of the intervention, far exceeding the benchmarks established in the Phase I proposal.
 During Phase II, the m-CBSMi for African American men will be fully developed. Then, in partnership with
Family and Medical Counseling Service, the effectiveness of the m-CBSMi to reduce BP among hypertensive
African American men will be examined. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the intervention
condition or to a matched control condition. Secondary measures will assess subjective stress, use of
antihypertensive medications, coping, well-being, gendered racial identity, and knowledge."

The exact nature of how positive and negative affective stimuli reciprocally interact within the brain to influence
learning and memory is not well resolved. Understanding how positive affective states impact discriminatory
threat learning, memory retention, and extinction has broad implications for the effectiveness of cognitive
behavioral therapies. Based on its connectivity to brain regions involved in threat responding, threat
generalization, the negative affect of pain, and salience detection, we hypothesize that the central nucleus of
the amygdala (CeA) is a key site for the integration positive and negative affective state information that is
important for the regulation of threat learning and the influences of affective state. Our preliminary results
demonstrate that co-presentation of a conditioned stimulus associated with positive valence with a conditioned
stimulus associated with a negative valence can prevent, reverse, or facilitate the extinction of a generalized
threat memory. We further show that this effect is dependent on the activation of neurons in the ventral
tegmental area and the modification of fear encoding neurons of the CeA by dopamine release. In this
proposal, we seek to resolve how positive stimuli influence fear encoding and threat discrimination at the level
of activation of specific neurotransmitter receptors in the CeA to facilitate discriminatory threat memories. We
further seek to resolve how positive and negative affective stimuli are differentially encoded in the CeA and
how these cell types can influence each other’s activity during positive and negative valence learning.
Resolving the basic brain mechanisms that allow positive affective stimuli to influence threat memories has
important implications for improving cognitive behavioral therapies in the treatment of generalized anxiety
disorders."
10822437,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Chronic musculoskeletal pain in older age is common, costly, and without a cure. A frequent and
detrimental consequence of pain is lower physical activity (PA). This is problematic for older adults
because lower PA increases risks of disability, depression, and dementia. My long-term goal is to
understand how to reduce the detrimental impact of pain on PA in older adults.
 Our preliminary work and others suggest that some older adults with pain can have higher levels of
PA, even with similar levels of pain, and are thus seemingly resilient to the impact of pain on PA. It is
unclear why this might be; pain characteristics such as severity, location, and duration do not fully explain
such pain resilience. Emerging evidence suggests that motivation is an important predictor of PA; studies
indicate a positive role for neural and behavioral measures of motivation, such as cortico-striatal limbic
activity and self-reported perception of energy and difficulty getting going. However, previous research has
focused on populations of younger adults without pain in cross-sectional designs.
 What is not known, and I propose to address here, is whether neural and behavioral measures of
motivation protect against PA decline similarly in older adults with and without pain. I hypothesize that pain
resilient older adults have higher levels of cortico-striatal limbic network activity and behavioral measures
of motivation compared to non-resilient older adults. The proposed study leverages the Health, Aging and
Body Composition Study, a biracial cohort of 3,075 older adults (ages 70-79 at entry, 42% Black, 52%
women) with existing longitudinal data of behavioral measures of motivation, pain, and PA over 13 years,
as well as extensive measures of other contributors of PA (e.g., comorbidities, polypharmacy). Resting
state functional connectivity of limbic network activity was collected in 315 participants at year 10. The
results of this study may help identify modifiable protective factors and inform future targets to promote
pain resiliency in older adults.
 This research project is synergistic with my training plan to mature three critical competencies: (1)
advanced skills in neuroepidemiological research methods; (2) translational experience in the neural
correlates of pain and motivation; (3) communication with scientific communities and the public. I have
formed an exceptional inter-disciplinary mentorship team that is well equipped to support this proposal and
my training. Through this funding, I will further develop the necessary foundation to become an
independent physician-epidemiologist improving the care of chronic pain in older adults in innovative and
evidence-based ways."
10822992,"Abstract. Bacterial endotoxins are components of the outer cell membranes of gram-negative organisms and is
one of the most potent human toxins. Due to the health dangers associated with endotoxin contamination, testing
is critical for pharmaceuticals, biological products, and medical devices. The majority of endotoxin testing still
relies on the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) assays using an extract from the blood of the horseshoe crabs.
This decades-old technology threatens a limited biological resource, which is considered vulnerable by
international organizations. We seek to enable the design of new endotoxin sensors with no requirement for
horseshoe crab blood or any of its components. In addition, unlike typical analytical assays composed of multiple
biological components and often complicated assay steps, our one-step lucCage biosensor can eliminate many
complexities of existing assays as it is a ""single-step, all-in-solution"" assay. Our approach will be enabled through
the (i) computational design and experimental selection of functional LPS bioluminescent biosensors; (ii) in vitro
evolution of biosensors to optimize sensitivity and stability; and (iii) optimization of the LPS detection assay
conditions and formulation of a 96-well kit. With our proprietary technology, we can develop alternative de novo
protein endotoxin biosensors that provide multiple advantages over current techniques: (i) sensitivity by using
bioluminescent readouts over turbidimetric, colorimetric or fluorescent readouts, (ii) broad dynamic range in a
single test that will reduce the total number of tests required by the user to quantify endotoxin in a sample, (iii)
stability and cost, as our biosensor proteins are highly stable and easy to manufacture. Thus, successful
development of endotoxin sensing lucCage biosensors will enable the development of sustainable, inexpensive,
and robust endotoxin bioassays of high impact in the biotechnology industry."
10820831,"Engagement of the macrophage integrated stress response in Salmonella infection
Project Summary
Infection of mammalian host cells by bacterial pathogens can be sensed through perturbations of
homeostatic cellular function. The integrated stress response (ISR) pathway is a central signaling
module that transforms information about cellular perturbation into programmatic remodeling of
many cellular processes, including protein translation, metabolism and inflammatory signaling.
The ISR consists of four sensor kinases that can phosphorylate a common target, eukaryotic
initiation factor-2α (eIF2α). Phosphorylated eIF2α suppresses bulk protein translation but allows
preferential translation of key transcripts, notably the transcription factor, ATF4, a hallmark of the
ISR. The mechanisms by which the ISR controls the inflammatory response to bacterial infection
is poorly defined. Our preliminary data demonstrate that in murine macrophages the ISR kinase,
GCN2, a sensor of amino acid depletion, triggers the ISR early during infection by the maladapted
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (STy), but not by the closely related pathogen, S. Typhimurium
(STm). GCN2 potentiated induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and anti-microbial defenses in
response to STy, but not STm. Addition of exogenous essential amino acids suppressed GCN2-
dependent production of ATF4 by STy. Curiously, ATF4 is activated at time points with minimal
bacterial replication, suggesting that depletion of host amino acids by bacterial competition may
not mechanistically explain activation of GCN2. However, we found that only live STy triggered
ATF4 production, pointing to the involvement of a bacterially-driven process. Together, these
findings lead to our central hypothesis that STy infection actively triggers GCN2 kinase activation
promoting development of macrophage effector mechanisms and inflammatory cytokines that
control STy intracellular survival and replication. We will test this hypothesis with the following
specific aims: (1) define STy-specific GCN2 activating signals and (2) determine the requirement
for GCN2 and the ISR in modulating macrophage metabolism, inflammation and anti-microbial
function. These studies will yield mechanistic insight into infection-induced triggers of the ISR and
elucidate therapeutic opportunities to modulate inflammation and infection."
10821571,"PROJECT SUMMARY Following injury to the lining of the mouth, or the oral mucosa, caused by cleft palate
repair (1:1000 live births), wisdom teeth removal (10 million/year) or trauma (1 million/year), there is a high inci-
dence of wound healing complications up to 60%. Oral wound healing complications lead to feeding, speech,
pain and ultimately surgery. Oral cavity wound healing is affected by physical trauma from eating and occurs in
a bacteria laden environment. The lack of an effective regenerative solution to oral wound healing leads to in-
creased cost and morbidity including revision surgeries, chronic pain and missed worked. Currently the only
available therapies to aid oral wound healing include allograft dermal implants, which carry the risk of HIV/prion
transmission, or platelet rich plasma (PRP). Neither have been demonstrated to be effective in rigorous, con-
trolled studies. To test potential oral regenerative therapies we developed a murine model of oral wound heal-
ing. Using this model we identified an immunomodulatory approach to improve the oral healing process. Our
regenerative solution delivers FTY720, an active biolipid, that targets the sphingosine pathway to preferentially
attract pro-regenerative neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages to create a pro-regenerative wound healing
environment. Our long-term goal is to develop an immunoregenerative approach to improve oral wound heal-
ing. The overall objective in this proposal is to compare the efficacy of FTY720 nanofibers (FTY720-NF) versus
PRP to improve oral wound healing in rodent and porcine animal models as a step toward clinical trials. The
central hypothesis is that the delivery of FTY720-NF attracts pro-regenerative inflammatory cells leading to re-
duced inflammation, increased vascularization and improved wound healing. The rationale for the proposed
research is that a comprehensive comparison of FTY720-NF with PRP will provide sufficient data to provide a
strong rationale for a Phase II submission focused on clinical trials. Guided by strong preliminary data, includ-
ing several publications demonstrating significant reduction in healing complications following FTY720 nano-
fiber delivery, the hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) AIM 1: Optimize and compare im-
munoregenerative efficacy of FTY720-NF versus PRP for oral wound healing in mice; 2) AIM 2: Test the effi-
cacy of FTY720-NF compared to PRP in oral wound healing in mini-pigs. In Aim 1 we will optimize the
FTY720-NF scaffold and identify changes in inflammatory cell recruitment to healing oral mucosa and identify
the extent of alterations in the vascularization and tissue induced by of FTY720-NF vs PRP. In Aim 2, we will
test the ability of FTY720-NF delivery to direct pro-regenerative oral wound healing in a porcine model. The
proposed research is innovative because the mechanisms that characterize oral wound healing in rodent and
porcine models induced by FTY720-NF and PRP have not been investigated before. The proposed research
is significant because FTY720, an already FDA-approved drug approved to treat multiple sclerosis, could be
fast tracked to clinical trials to reduce ONF formation."

 Motion related artifacts are a significant source of cost to the healthcare system. With over 12,000 MRI
scanners in the U.S. and estimates that $434,000 are lost per scanner each year, motion in MRIs is costing our
health care system approximately $4B yearly. Our FDA-cleared software solution Framewise Integrated Real-
Time MRI Monitoring (FIRMM) mitigates data lost due to motion. However, the majority of paying customers so
far are academic neuroimaging research centers; to ensure the commercial success of FIRMM, we need to
expand the customer base to advanced brain mapping for clinical care. The goal of this CRP application is to
fill the remaining gap in FIRMM’s path to clinical commercialization success by partnering with Philips to
complete and verify FIRMM and FIRMM-pix integration with their scanner environment. Pediatric advanced
brain mapping will serve as the initial proof-of-principle clinical market.
 Leading hospitals and device manufacturers have expressed enthusiasm to use FIRMM for clinical
care; however, two main barriers to clinical adoption remain: a reduction in technician critical decision making
and availability of a collection of motion tracking enabled navigator sequences for clinical care. Amongst the
leading MRI manufacturers, Philips has a specific focus on pediatric brain imaging, which includes patient
comfort solutions. Philips’ pulse sequence programming environment is unique in that it allows the addition of
navigator pulses to exciting sequences much more easily than competitors such as Siemens and GE.
Integrating FIRMM and FIRMM-pix navigated sequence package will create the first complete software-based
motion mitigation solution for clinical brain mapping. Integrating the FIRMM tablet Philips' will lead to a more
seamless integration into existing workflows; thus reducing the disruption to existing complex clinical
workflows.
 In addition, integrating the FIRMM tablet with Philips will help facilitate the wide-spread adoption of
FIRMM/-pix in the clinical market by obtaining widespread visibility via potential co-marketing with Philips and
other medtech companies. This CRP is perfectly positioned to put FIRMM and its subsequent products on a
pathway to long-term success."
10828786,"Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in women worldwide. Mitotic Arrest Deficient 1
(Mad1) is commonly upregulated in breast cancer where it serves as a marker of poor prognosis, and
upregulation of Mad1 is sufficient for tumorigenesis in orthotopic breast cancer models. Mad1 was identified and
characterized for its function in mitosis, where it serves to prevent chromosome missegregation/chromosomal
instability (CIN). CIN has been implicated in promoting both primary and metastatic tumors. However, Mad1 is
expressed throughout interphase and we have recently shown that a non-canonical interphase function of Mad1
in destabilizing the p53 tumor suppressor is critical for Mad1 upregulation to promote orthotopic mammary tumor
growth. Additionally, we identified a previously unrecognized pool of Mad1 that localizes to the Golgi apparatus.
At the Golgi, Mad1 performs another non-canonical function in the maturation and secretion of newly synthesized
α5 integrin, a critical metastasis promoter and marker of poor prognosis. Thus, Mad1 upregulation results in
three tumor- and metastasis-promoting phenotypes: CIN, p53 destabilization and α5 integrin secretion. Aim 1
will determine which functions of Mad1 upregulation are necessary and sufficient for tumor promotion using
separation of function mutants, competition experiments, specific inhibitors, and novel CRISPR/Cas9 edited
mouse models. Aim 2 will define the mechanisms by which Mad1 functions in the secretion of newly synthesized
α5 integrin, which will provide novel opportunities to inhibit α5 integrin activity in promoting metastasis. Together,
the proposed experiments will identify the mechanistic basis of the tumor promoting activity of Mad1 and define
the α5 integrin biosynthetic trafficking pathway, which will expand our fundamental understanding of breast
cancer and reveal novel therapeutic targets."

Opioid users are prime beneficiaries of cure strategies for HIV due to their medical and social vulnerabilities and
low adherence to antiretroviral therapies, but the nature of the latent reservoir in people using morphine or heroin
is unknown. The central hypothesis of this multi-PI proposal is that HIV DNA+ cells from opioid users show unique
transcriptional and proteomic signatures that provide fundamental insight into initiation, establishment and
maintenance of the latent reservoir in drug users. This hypothesis is based on our recent data in Nature
characterizing HIV DNA+ CD4+ T cells without prior activation using a new sorting and sequencing strategy called
FIND-Seq. We further show that specific silencing and cell survival pathways are altered in latently infected cells
and identify 55 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) implicated in the underlying biology of HIV latency. Here
we propose to extend these studies to tissue reservoirs from opioid users, test the functional relevance of DEGs
on latency biology, and develop important genomic, proteomic and biochemical advancements of FIND-Seq.
The central hypothesis will be tested in four specific aims: 1) Define the cellular mechanisms of HIV persistence
and their modulation by morphine in HIV-infected T cells and microglia from Last Gift participants. We will use
FIND-seq to sort and RNA sequence HIV+ cells from the spleen, gut, and brain of Last Gift participants with and
without morphine to elucidate the role of opioids on latently infected T cells and microglia across different tissues.
2) Determine how DEGs and opioids regulate HIV latency in T cells and microglia. We will perform ex vivo
CRISPR activation/interference experiments with isolated CD4+ T cells and microglia derived from induced
pluripotent stem cells to determine the functional relevance of identified DEGs for latency establishment with and
without morphine or heroin. 3) Perform a proteogenomic analysis of HIV+CD4+ T cells from the spleen of Last
Gift participants. We will use DAb-seq, which allows high-coverage genome sequencing and simultaneous
analysis of cell-surface protein expression on CD4+ T cells from spleens from Last Gift participants with or without
morphine to determine the intactness of the provirus, its integration site, and changes in protein expression of
latently infected cells induced by opioid use. 4) Simultaneously sequence the RNA, protein, and full HIV genome
from HIV DNA+ cells. We will develop FIND-Seq into a multimodal assay that sorts HIV DNA+ cells on a flow
cytometer and simultaneously performs genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic analysis on recovered cells. We
have assembled a highly complementary team of world experts in the biology and advanced investigation of HIV
latency with cutting-edge microfluidics, CRISPR and multi-omics sequencing technologies combined with
leading experts in clinical care of people living with HIV and opioid use from the Last Gift Cohort and the Johns
Hopkins HIV Clinical Cohort. We expect to gain paradigm-shifting insight into the “underlying molecular
mechanisms by which HIV latency is initiated, established, and maintained in the CNS, lymphoid and myeloid
tissues and how substance use might influence these processes” and are fully aligned with this RFA."

Recent advances in neuroimaging technology have significantly contributed to a better understanding of brain
organization, and the development and application of more efficient clinical programs. However, inherent
limitations to the existing techniques make large-scale imaging of neural activity with high spatiotemporal
resolution and specificity in young populations challenging (1). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
is predominantly performed on sleeping infants to minimize motion-related artifacts and avoid exposure to certain
stimuli in the novel scanner environment (e.g., loud noise). Techniques that can be used in awake infants, such
as electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy
(fNIRS) are more suited to study cognitive (non-motor) developmental mechanisms. A recent review study from
our team revealed high level of exclusion rates associated with technical limitations in pediatric neuroimaging
explaining the limited neuroimaging motor-related studies in infants (less than 5%). Functional ultrasound
imaging (fUSI) is a novel technology that provides a unique combination of spatial coverage (depth up to 8 cm),
unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution (100 μm, up to 10 ms) and compatibility with freely moving subjects
(2). While most fUSI studies have been conducted in rodents (2-5), one of the most exciting aspects of this
technology is its ability to scale to larger organisms, including monkeys (6, 7), adult humans (8), and sleeping
infants (9, 10). Although fUSI typically requires thinned skull surgery or trepanation to enable the penetration of
the ultrasound waves, in infants, fUSI images can be acquired non-invasively through the fontanels. The first
proof-of-concept application of fUSI in neonates opened a new avenue for studying the brain in infancy (9, 10).
However, this study was performed on sleeping infants, limiting the type of behavioral paradigms that can be
used to explore neural correlates of motor development. Here, we take the next major leap in functional
neuroimaging by extending fUSI technology to study the brain in infancy during motor control performance. Aim
1 will assess the functional organization of the motor system in infants performing a reaching task.
Typically developing infants will reach to targets, while brain activity will be recorded using fUSI and
biomechanical and behavioral data will be collected. Our hypothesis is that fUSI will successfully detect
increased motor-related brain activity during reaching. Aim 2 will develop tools to decode motor activity in
the infant brain using fUSI. We will attempt to decode the direction of reaching movements from the fUSI
activity – an essential component for building non-invasive brain-machine interface (BMI) systems for very young
populations with motor impairments in the future. If successful, this project will provide neuroscience with high
resolution imaging technology for monitoring brain activity in awake and behaving infants, while setting the
foundation for the development of non-invasive ultrasonic BMI systems for infant motor rehabilitation."
10791797,"The dopaminergic “reward” circuitry undergoes significant developmental plasticity during
adolescence, including the refinement of dopamine D1 and D2 (D1/D2r) receptors within the
nucleus accumbens (NAc). We have recently demonstrated in male rats that microglia – the
primary immune cells of the CNS that also play a role in sculpting developing circuits – engulf and
eliminate D1rs during a precise window of adolescent NAc development in response to receptor
“tagging” by complement protein C3; and that this developmental pruning of D1rs by microglia is
critical for the development of normal reward-driven behavior (social play). Moreover, rats that
receive repeated morphine during adolescence (but not young adulthood) show persistent
changes in microglial function and increased reinstatement to morphine as adults; and, pre-
treatment with a glial modulator during adolescent morphine exposure prevents this increased
reinstatement, implicating a critical role for microglia. Microglia refine synapses based on
changes in neural activity, leading us to hypothesize that, in males (1) microglia sculpt NAc D1rs
during normal adolescence as a consequence of altered dopamine (DA) activity which leads to
receptor tagging by the “eat me” signal C3; and (2) factors that significantly impact DA signaling
within the NAc during adolescence could persistently alter reward processing - including addiction
liability - by changing microglial pruning of D1rs. We will use 3 aims to test the hypothesis that
dopaminergic input to the NAc leads to complement C3 “tagging” of D1r and phagocytosis by
microglia and that disruptions of this normal input (e.g. by social isolation stress) will lead to
dysregulated long-term reward-driven behaviors. Importantly, D1r refinement occurs via
unknown mechanisms in females, independent of microglia-C3 interaction, and the implications
for addiction have not been assessed. To explore putative mechanisms in females we will
additionally assess changes in D2r, and examine additional putative molecular tags/ “eat-me”
signals."

 The state of the mother's immune system during pregnancy plays an important role in fetal
development, and disruptions in this immune balance are associated with a range of neuropsychiatric
and neurodevelopmental disorders. Epidemiological and clinical studies have revealed associations
between neurodevelopmental disorders including Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Attention Deﬁcit
Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and family history of immune system dysfunction, most notably allergies
and asthma. Over the past three decades, analogous increases have been reported in both the
incidence of ASD, ADHD, and immune-related disorders, particularly immune hypersensitivities that
include allergies and asthma. Several case-control reports have noted that mothers with elevated
allergic-associated cytokines during pregnancy are at greater risk of having a child who was later
diagnosed with ASD or ADHD. These data raise the hypothesis that maternal allergic asthma (MAA)
produces neurobehavioral deﬁcits in offspring and highlight a yet undetermined link between the
maternal immune system and risk of neurodevelopmental disorders. Using a validated mouse model of
allergic asthma, we have demonstrated that offspring of MAA dams exhibit behavioral deﬁcits
characterized by decreased social interactions and increased repetitive behaviors. This proposal will
extend these ﬁndings by exploring the mechanistic contribution of the allergic asthma-associated
cytokine interleukin-4 (IL-4) in driving the link between MAA on offspring brain and behavior
development. Speciﬁcally we will [1] determine the contribution of maternal IL-4 signaling in
precipitating neurodevelomental deﬁcits, [2] characterize the safety and efﬁcacy of the allergic asthma
medication dupilumab, an IL-4 receptor antagonist, in preventing the effects of MAA on offspring
behavior, [3] examine the neuroimmunological consequences of MAA on offspring brain development,
and [4] associate changes in neuroimmune signaling with behavioral outcomes. The results of these
experiments will determine the extent to which maternal IL-4 signaling in allergic asthma contributes to
offspring neurodevelopmental deﬁcits and inform future therapeutic interventions for mitigating the
effects of maternal asthma in at-risk populations."

In this K23 career development award, Dr. Rujuta Wilson will develop training in quantitative analysis of motor
development to aid in early identification of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Dr. Wilson’s longer-term
goal is to be a leading clinician-scientist in motor development, utilizing novel quantitative methods and
analyses to identify mechanisms, biomarkers, and treatments of motor impairments across diverse
developmental populations affected by these impairments. Through the support of this K23 and the enriched
transdisciplinary training environment and resources at UCLA, Dr. Wilson aims to accomplish the following
training goals: (1) develop expertise in theoretical models and assessment of infant motor and developmental
trajectories, (2) acquire knowledge of optimal statistical methods and skills in longitudinal modeling, signal
processing, and machine learning techniques to analyze complex quantitative motor data and develop
prediction models, (3) develop proficiency in advanced methods of clinical research design and
implementation, and (4) translate the K23 training and findings into an R01 utilizing motor risk markers to aid in
clinical stratification and monitor developmental outcomes of a targeted motor intervention. To achieve these
goals, Dr. Wilson has assembled an exemplary mentorship team, including her primary mentor, Dr. James
McCracken, a child psychiatrist with decades of research dedicated to studying development in children and in
design and conduct of clinical trials in NDDs; co-mentor, Dr. Grace Baranek, a leader in the study of sensory-
motor and behavioral risk markers of NDDs in the first year of life; co-mentor, Dr. David Elashoff, a leader of
biostatistics with extensive knowledge of high dimensional data sets and sensor monitoring data; collaborators
and contributors, Drs. William Kaiser, Beth Smith, Shafali Jeste, and Susan Bookheimer, experts in advanced
analytic techniques of signal processing and machine learning, wearable sensors, high risk infant studies, and
neuroimaging methods in high risk infants, respectively. Motor impairments occur across an array of NDDs and
emerge early in disease course, but early identification remains an ongoing challenge due to lack of
quantitative measures that can objectively identify these early motor impairments. The overarching goal of the
proposed longitudinal study is to (1) utilize a validated wearable sensor to derive quantitative measurements of
motor function and identify motor impairments in infants at high risk for NDDs (e.g., infants with an older sibling
with Autism Spectrum Disorder [ASD]) as early as 3 months of age, and (2) examine the relationship of these
motor impairments to symptoms of ASD and to delays in social communication, language, and cognition. This
proposal will facilitate the development of novel transdiagnostic motor phenotyping tools that can be utilized to
inform clinical screening, clinical risk stratification, and intervention studies across a range of neurologic
disorders. These aims directly address NICHD research priorities; in particular, “research establishing the
validity of biomarkers and outcome measures for intellectual and developmental disability symptoms.”"

10789562,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency and N-acetylglutamate synthetase (NAGS) deficiency are inborn
errors of metabolism that are caused by genetic defects in the urea cycle genes OTC and NAGS. Genetic
defects in these genes can cause hyperammonemia, brain edema, and neurological injury that ranges from
mild executive functioning deficits to profound intellectual and developmental disabilities and even death. OTC
deficiency is the most common and the only X-linked urea cycle disorder (UCD) whereas NAGS deficiency is
the only UCD that can be effectively treated with drug monotherapy. Because of the broad spectrum of
neuropsychological sequelae associated with OTC and NAGS deficiencies, understanding their molecular
basis and improving their early diagnosis are among NICHD high research priorities.
OTC and NAGS deficiencies are most often diagnosed by DNA testing because biochemical testing may not
always sufficiently differentiate between different UCDs. DNA sequence variants identified in these genes are
not always deleterious, and the current ACMG (American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics) and
AMP (Association for Molecular Pathology) standardized framework for the interpretation and classification of
DNA variants relies on published or publicly available computational, functional, segregation, population, allelic
and clinical data in order to classify a variant. Because such publicly available data is limited, the majority of
known sequence variants in the urea cycle genes OTC and NAGS would currently be classified as variants of
uncertain significance. Correct classification of such variants is necessary 1) to accurately diagnose and treat
these disorders 2) for reproductive counseling of affected patients and their relatives and 3) to inform the
design of diagnostic eligibility criteria for clinical trials of these disorders.
To permit the correct assignment of pathogenicity of known OTC and NAGS variants by clinical diagnostic
laboratories and by the NIH-supported ClinGen UCD Variant Curation Expert Panel, this project seeks to
leverage the combined data from 3 sources: 1) the largest natural history study of UCDs conducted by the
NICHD-funded UCD Consortium, 2) the largest US clinical UCD expert center, Children’s National Hospital and
3) the largest private OTC and NAGS dataset from the legacy Tuchman lab. The Tuchman lab was an
academic laboratory that prior to 2012 served as the US reference center for clinical OTC and NAGS
sequencing. The legacy database of this lab contains over 20 years of variant and unpublished clinical data
from US patients with OTC and NAGS and their relatives. We propose to combine and disambiguate
anonymized data from these 3 complementary datasets, and publish the data that fulfill segregation,
population, allelic and clinical variant curation criteria. For each OTC and NAGS variant, we intend to submit
these data into ClinVar, a publicly accessible database that aggregates information about genetic variants."

Cells in the same tissue can express the exact same gene at different levels, and this cell-to-cell variation
tends to increase with age. Cells in tissues need to coordinate gene expression to maintain homeostasis.
Thus, dysregulated variation may be related to, or causative of, the loss of physiological capacities with age.
However, the causes and consequences of this increased gene expression variation are not known. In this
project I propose to use C. elegans and human tissue culture as model systems to study age-related variation
in gene expression between homologous cells in controlled environments. In our prior study, we found strong,
cell-specific expression patterns for many reporter genes in young C. elegans animals; that is, for many genes
in young animals, the ratio of gene A to gene B expression was fixed in cell type X, and different than in cell
type Y. We found that this fixed expression pattern deteriorates with age; in a given cell type genes become
expressed at variable stoichiometry in individual animals. Similarly, in mammals, cell-to-cell variation in gene
expression observed during aging or senescence is also uncorrelated. Thus, I propose that growing
dissimilarity between homologous cells with age may be a conserved phenomenon of aging. I refer to increase
of uncorrelated gene expression variation with age as age-related variegated gene expression (VGE). In the
proposed project, I will harness both the power of C. elegans and human cell culture to investigate how
homologous cells become more dissimilar with age. In the K99 phase of the project I will learn techniques for
quantitative microscopy, single cell RNAseq and aging-focused human cell culture methods. Throughout the
K99 and R00, I will be investigating potential causes that contribute to age-related VGE. K99-Aim1: I will
determine if changes of allele access with age contribute into VGE in C. elegans by analyzing expression from
of identical promoters integrated at the identical loci on sister chromosomes. K99-Aim2: I will learn and use
single-cell RNA-seq to determine if prevalence of allele bias/monoallelism rises in human fibroblasts with age.
R00-Aim3: I will determine what genes and pathways become highly variably expressed with age. I will
examine if variable expression of these genes is stochastic or adaptive by determining if expression levels of
reporters of these genes predict stress resistance, health or lifespan. These experiments will address the
hypothesis that adaptive physiological responses of individual cells to age-related stress contribute to VGE.
R00-Aim 4: Using human cell culture, I will determine if cell-to-cell communications propagate VGE among
cells with youthful expression patterns – that is, cells without VGE."
10791752,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Osteoporosis is a common clinical condition characterized by low bone mass that increases the risk of fragility
fractures in the elderly population. Since bone formation is clearly impaired in osteoporotic patients, a more
complete understanding of the fundamental molecular mechanisms that regulate bone metabolism is likely to
lead to the development of novel therapies. Therefore, identification of novel molecular pathways which
influence bone formation is crucial to the development of clinical treatments to combat osteoporosis. Our
previous work has definitively established that the anti-osteogenic transcription factor, retinoic acid receptor-
related orphan receptor-beta (Rorβ) plays an inhibitory role in osteoblast differentiation. Increasing expression
levels of Rorβ during physiological aging contributes to bone loss, as mice lacking Rorβ exhibit higher bone
mass through activation of the bone anabolic Wnt pathway. This leads to the notion that inhibition of Rorβ may
represent a novel paradigm to increase bone mass throughout the aging process. We hypothesized that
microRNAs (miRs) may control Rorβ levels, and found that a specific miR, miR-219a-5p (miR-219a), the top
predicted Rorβ-regulatory miR, exhibits an inverse expression pattern to Rorβ, suggesting a potential
Rorβ/miR-219a regulatory axis in bone. We demonstrate that miR-219a directly regulates Rorβ levels in
osteoblasts, that delivery of miR-219a mimics enhances osteoblast differentiation, and that miR-219a
antagonists suppress differentiation. We further show that miR-219a increases the activity of the bone anabolic
Wnt pathway. Therefore, we propose that miR-219a is bone anabolic and may be used to preserve bone mass
with age, possibly through increasing Wnt pathway activity. Using a novel mouse model where we can activate
miR-219a expression in a tissue-specific manner, in Aim 1 we will determine the effects of miR-219a in Rorβ-
expressing cells on adult bone mass or following a fracture, with the hypothesis that downregulation of Rorβ
through miR-219a will increase bone mass and accelerate fracture healing. In Aim 2, we will explore the more
general effects of miR-219a in bone homeostasis by activating miR-219a in various bone cell lineages, with the
hypothesis that downregulation of Rorβ, and/or other miR-219a targets in these lineages, will increase bone
mass with age. Finally, in Aim 3 we will perform in vitro experiments to explore the molecular mechanism of
how miR-219a regulates the Wnt pathway and determine whether direct targeting of Rorβ by miR-219a affects
Wnt activity and bone cell function. Completion of these pivotal studies will not only provide a more complete
understanding of miR-219a function in bone, but if positive will also provide a strong justification for pursuing
miR-219a mimics as a novel therapeutic strategy to stimulate bone formation in various clinical conditions."
10791753,"The cGAS-STING pathway senses cytosolic DNA in infected cells and cancer cells and triggers production of
type I interferon and other cytokines, thus eliciting immune responses. Deficiency in the pathway prevents T
cell responses to several viruses and to transplanted tumor lines. Our new results show that the pathway is
critical for activating spontaneous NK cell responses against cancer, and virus infections. Furthermore, in
probing the underlying mechanisms, our research has uncovered a new cellular mechanism whereby cGAS
and STING activate immune responses. Using genetic approaches, we found that the NK response to
transferred tumor cells depends on cGAS expression in tumor cells and STING expression in host cells. We
interpret these data to indicate that cGAS activation is the key event that occurs in infected or transformed cells
resulting in the production of the cyclic dinucleotide cGAMP. cGAMP is then transferred from the
infected/transformed cells to other immune cells, such as antigen presenting cells, which are induced to initiate
the immune response. Hence, we propose that cGAMP transfer between cells is a fundamental
mechanism in immune activation. In considering how cGAMP is transferred between cells, we hypothesized
that specific membrane transporters must play a role. Using a genome-wide CRISPRi screen, we identified a
transporter molecule that specifically imports cGAMP into cells. Using a series of knockout mice and
conditional knockout mice, and cellular manipulations and transfers, we propose to test the requirement of
cGAS-STING signaling in NK and T cell responses to cancer and DNA viruses, the generality of the
requirement of the transfer mechanism in viral infections and cancer models and for T cell and NK cell
responses, the roles of the newly identified transporters in the process, and to define the specific cells that
must import the cGAMP for immune responses to occur. Specifically, we will: (1) Determine the sites of
action of cGAMP and STING and intercellular transfer of cGAMP in anti-viral responses, including NK
and T cell responses; (2) Determine sites of action of cGAMP and STING and intercellular transfer of
cGAMP in T cell responses to cancer, in transfer models and GEM cancer models; (3) Determine roles of
cGAMP transporters in anti-viral and anti-tumor and immune responses. Using conditional knockout mice
and inhibitor studies, we will test their function in anti-herpesvirus and anti-tumor responses, including a GEM
model of cancer."

 While ‘diversity-oriented,’ ‘biology-oriented,’ and ‘analogue-oriented’ syntheses have contributed to
Wender’s call for ‘function-oriented synthesis,’ the simultaneous alignment of total synthesis efforts with structure
activity relationship (SAR) studies has not been fully realized. This is particularly true with natural products where
little to no SAR information exists. Bringing hypotheses regarding a targeted natural product's pharmacophore

of simplified, bioactive derivatives as lead compounds for therapeutic intervention.

targets, be more closely aligned to biological studies by targeting designed derivatives possessing a
hypothesized pharmacophore during the retrosynthetic planning stages to enable SAR studies to be conducted
en route to the natural product? Our study will develop a type of innovative retrosynthetic analysis that more
closely aligns total synthesis efforts with concurrent biological studies. We term this strategy ‘pharmacophore-
directed retrosynthesis’ (PDR) to emphasize the importance of considering hypothesized pharmacophores at
the retrosynthetic planning stage of a total synthesis effort. This approach will importantly lead to the identification
of simplified versions of the natural product with similar potency or potentially new functions in route to the natural
product. While this approach increases the challenges of natural product total synthesis beyond important,
contemporary goals, including atom-economy, step and redox efficiency, and protecting group avoidance,
significantly it will greatly accelerate harvesting of the vast information content of natural products for basic cell
biology and medicine. This strategy begins with a hypothesized pharmacophore for a bioactive natural product
which informs and directs the retrosynthetic strategy. Stepwise, methodical introduction of complexity to the
hypothesized pharmacophore enables concurrent SAR data collection which in turn informs cellular probe
synthesis. A fruitful group of ongoing collaborators, including molecular, cell, and cancer biologists and chemical
biologists will utilize our natural product-based probes to contribute to fundamental advances in cell biology.
Overall, our proposed synthetic studies, combined with collaborative biological studies, will both open new
avenues for novel therapeutics, and contribute to a greater understanding of basic cellular mechanisms involved
in human disease including bacterial infection, inflammation, cardiovascular, Alzheimer’s disease, and cancer.
 The proposed research will demonstrate the importance of closely engaging total synthesis efforts with
biological studies of natural products at the retrosynthetic planning stages. We will demonstrate the utility of
PDR for reverse chemical genetic explorations of natural products towards identification of new drug leads and
novel cellular targets critical to uncovering new avenues to impact human health."
10791839,"Project Summary:
 This project investigates the cochlear AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) that are necessary for
hearing, overactivation of which leads to excitotoxic synapse loss and hearing disorders. Each cochlear
afferent synapse expresses many hundreds to a few thousand of these AMPARs, of both the Ca2+-permeable
subtype (CP-AMPARs, lacking subunit GluA2) and the Ca2+-impermeable subtype (CI-AMPARs, containing
subunit GluA2). The combination of pore-forming GluA subunits and auxiliary subunits of the AMPAR complex,
influenced by transsynaptic adhesion factors, determine its physiological properties and pharmacological
sensitivities. The cochlear AMPAR complex has properties that make it unique in the nervous system, for
example, the absence of GluA1. However, the precise complement of cochlear AMPAR subunits in not known.
This proposal uses mouse genetics, in vivo and ex vivo cochlear electrophysiology, proteomics, and
ultrastructural molecular anatomy to investigate the subunit composition, pharmacological sensitivity, and
functional significance of the cochlear AMPAR complex. We will determine the influence of auxiliary subunit
TARP-2 (Stargazin) on cochlear function, synaptic transmission, and GluA subunit expression. We will test
the hypothesis that synaptopathy in GluA3KO mice results from an increase in Ca2+-permeability of the AMPAR
complex. We will determine how Neuroligin1 and 3 affect AMPAR subunit expression and auditory nerve fiber
physiology. We will determine the influence of GluA3, TARP-2, Nlgn1, and Nlgn3 on the intrasynaptic
distribution of AMPAR subunits. With recombinant expression of different combinations of GluA pore-forming
and auxiliary subunits in HEK cells (with or without GluA3, with or without TARP-2), we will challenge our
understanding of the cochlear AMPAR complex by comparing changes in pharmacological sensitivity with
those changes observed for the native cochlear synapses (GluA3WT vs GluA3KO, TARP-2WT vs TARP-2KO).
The gain of this basic knowledge will inform design of small molecules to target cochlear AMPARs. With
chronic systemic administration of the tool compound (CP-AMPAR blocker IEM-1925), we will measure
synaptic adaptation and resistance to noise-induced synaptopathy. With acute systemic dosing, we will ask if
noise trauma can be prevented if IEM-1925 is given only during, not before, the noise exposure and if IEM-
1925 + antioxidant combination therapy can protect cochlear function from more intense noise exposures. The
long-term goal of this line of investigation is to develop systemic drugs to target CP-AMPARs of the inner ear
while allowing hearing function to be maintained through CI-AMPARs, and while avoiding unwanted CNS side
effects. The successful completion of this collaborative project will determine the precise subunit composition
of the cochlear AMPAR complex and its influence on pharmacological sensitivity."
10791840,"Circadian Effects in the Stroke Penumbra
Almost all rodent stroke research is performed in the daytime. For nocturnal rodents, this is their inactive (non-
awake) phase. In humans, more ischemic strokes occur during the daytime, and almost all patients in
neuroprotection trials are also recruited in the daytime. But for diurnal humans, this is their active (awake)
phase. We hypothesize that this “circadian mismatch” contributes to translational problems in stroke.
Our preliminary data (some published in Esposito et al, Nature 2020) suggest that: (i) neuroprotection may be
more difficult in active phase versus inactive phase stroke; (ii) the penumbra may evolve differently in active
phase versus inactive phase stroke; and (iii) vascular regulation and cell death mechanisms may be affected
by circadian rhythm. From a clinical perspective, the two important aspects of the stroke penumbra are blood
flow and infarct progression. Therefore, we will pursue 4 integrated aims to investigate circadian effects on flow
and cell death in the penumbra.
In Aim 1, we will map penumbral blood flow, metabolism, cellular response, tissue injury and behavioral
outcomes in mouse focal cerebral ischemia across the entire sinusoidal cycle of circadian rhythm. In Aim 2, we
will map the effects of cerebral ischemia on central and peripheral circadian rhythms during stroke evolution. In
Aim 3, we test the hypothesis that the circadian gene Bmal1 regulates endothelial shear stress that underlies
hemodynamic response in the penumbra. In Aim 4, we test the hypothesis that Bmal1 regulates glutamate
reuptake transporters, antioxidant gene expression, and anti-apoptotic mediators that underlie circadian
influences on excitotoxicity, oxidative stress and apoptosis.
Circadian biology affects almost all aspects of physiology, disease, and response to therapies (Cederroth et al,
Cell Metab 2019). This project may represent the first step in what should be a larger effort to re-assess
experimental stroke and neurovascular unit mechanisms with the “correct” circadian context."
10786671,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Telomere attrition starts in early life, tracks into adulthood, and is associated with increased risk for aging-related
chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease. Because genetic factors explain only a small proportion of
telomere length variability, it is critical to determine prenatal environmental exposures that affect telomere length
dynamics in early life. Recent evidence shows that prenatal exposures to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs)
may promote telomere attrition in young children. However, existing data are limited, and the potential interplay
of EDC mixtures with other environmental stressors and the implicated mechanisms remain unknown. For
example, dietary factors and obesity also have been associated with shorter telomere length, potentially by
altering oxidative stress, inflammation, and metabolic pathways that are also disrupted by EDCs. Thus, EDC
exposures may act synergistically with diet and obesity to influence telomere length dynamics in childhood and
beyond. However, no previous study has examined the potential impacts and interactions of prenatal EDC
exposures with other factors on telomere lenght dynamics during the sensitive period of accelerated growth in
the transition from childhood to adolescence. Therefore, we propose the first and largest longitudinal
investigation on the prenatal exposome and telomere attrition, with extended follow-up through
adolescence. We will use an innovative multi-omics analytical framework to advance the knowledge about the
joint impacts of prenatal EDC exposures and their interplay with diet, obesity, and inflammatory and metabolic
pathways on telomere lenght dynamics and adolescent health. Our central hypothesis, supported by strong
preliminary results, is that prenatal exposures to EDC mixtures and their interactions promote telomere attrition
in childhood and through adolescence by dysregulating inflammatory and metabolism-regulating pathways. To
test this hypothesis, we will leverage the unique existing resources of the population-based Human Early Life
Exposome (HELIX) project. HELIX provides an unparalleled early-life exposome characterization (>200
environmental exposures) with completely harmonized biomonitoring data on ~80 known EDCs and repeated
telomere lenght measurements in 700 mothers and their children followed longitudinally from pregnancy to age
~16 years in six European countries. We will measure high-throughput proteomics covering >700 inflammation
and metabolic proteins in archived plasma from children collected at age ~8 years to comprehensively
characterize biological pathways promoting telomere attrition due to early-life EDC exposures, as well as their
interplay with telomere lenght tracking from childhood to adolescence. Findings will advance our understanding
of the impacts of early-life exposures to exogenous chemicals and their interplay with diet, obesity, and
inflammatory and metabolic pathways on telomere attrition during sensitive periods of development. This
knowledge will critically inform environmental public health policies and personalized interventions for early
prevention of cardiovascular disease as well as other highly prevalent aging-related chronic diseases."

Affinity reagents are essential to almost any modern scientific investigation of human disease. Antibodies are
the most widely used family of affinity reagents and when cloned and produced in culture represent a powerful
tool that can be continually regenerated. Many monoclonal antibodies boast strong interactions, slow off-rates,
and good specificity. To supplement monoclonal antibodies, the Baker laboratory at the University of
Washington has developed techniques to design small proteins de novo that bind molecules of interest. The
overall goal of this Core entitled, “Affinity Regent Characterization Core,” is to provide the reagents needed for
Projects 2 and 3 by (1) developing new monoclonal antibodies to be used in different assays, (2) labeling
antibodies and novel small protein affinity reagents for use in CyTOF and brain imaging, and (3) carefully
characterizing each reagent to ensure that different batches of affinity reagents behave similarly."
10792936,"Abstract
Despite the association between the levels of CSF Aβ42, tau, phosphorylated tau and underlying AD
pathology, measures of biomarker accuracy for clinical diagnosis vary widely between studies. Given that
other neurodegenerative conditions can present with AD-like clinical symptoms, and individuals with AD
frequently have comorbid pathologies, additional markers are needed that can aid in differential diagnosis and
identify mixed pathologies. Over the last decade, many candidate biomarkers have been identified, reflecting a
range of pathophysiological processes including cholesterol metabolism, neuroinflammation and amyloid
processing. However, few, have been adopted in clinical practice or been validated in large independent
cohorts1.
The MacCoss lab and others have been pioneering the development of next generation proteomics methods
as an alternative to the classic stochastic mass spectrometry-based methods. These new methods offer a
hybrid between a targeted and global proteomics strategy. While mass spectrometry data is collected in an
unbiased way, the data is analyzed in a targeted strategy where specific peptides, albeit 1000s are analyzed
using prior information. Thus, the reproducible targeting, throughput, and confident MS/MS-based
quantification of parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) can be combined with classical discovery methods' ability
to qualitatively detect thousands of proteins. These new methods based on systematically collected mass
spectrometry data can offer similar quantitative figures of merit and can be validated in analogous fashion to
clinical assays.
Despite advances in proteomics technologies, most attempts at discovering new CSF markers have either
used 1) stochastic sampling methods (e.g. data dependent acquisition) with poorly characterized quantitative
performance, 2) small sample cohorts, 3) focused entirely on total CSF, 4) ignored protein processing, and 5)
did not consider protein misfolding or stability. The purpose of this project within the cooperative research
program is to take our methods to another level – apply true quantitative methods to large well
characterized cohorts and extend them to functionally relevant subpopulations.
We have a CSF assay that can measure >1050 proteins from completely unfractionated material with figures
of merit of within/between day precision, linearity, LOD/LOQ, etc... Furthermore, we can use this assay on
subsets of the CSF proteome to assess functionally relevant aspects of the neurobiology including quantity as
part of solution or CSF particles, intact protein MW, and protein stability. Finally, we have enough throughput
to apply these analyses on a scale sufficient to eliminate the chance that an observation is due to an aberrant
subpopulation."

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major threat to health of older individuals and is a looming public health disaster.
Promised solutions in diagnostics and therapeutics will come only through research. Project 2 proposes to
gain biological and medical insights into the proteins discovered in the Center by multiplex mapping to specific
CSF extracellular vesicles (EV) and lipoproteins (LP), and to specific cells and subcellular structures in specific
regions of brain.
Proteins in CSF remain the best performing biomarkers for AD. CSF proteins exist in various forms: free in
solution, on a unique class of LP, and on EV that include exosomes, microvesicles, and apoptotic bodies. LP
and EV have varying mechanisms of production and biological functions. Localization and relative
quantification of proteins of interest discovered in Project 1 to each class of CSF particles will provide powerful
insight into cell of origin, cellular biology, and potential medical meaning.
Further biological and medical insights can be gained by carefully mapping proteins in human brain. Indeed,
the power of multiplexed imaging is its ability to reveal co-localization or mutual exclusivity, and to infer
regulatory roles and gain mechanistic insight. For example, we think very differently about the biological roles
of proteins restricted in their expression to synapses vs. mitochondria, glutamatergic vs. GABA-ergic neurons,
or hippocampal pyramidal neurons vs. striatal medium spiny neurons. In pathologic states, co-localization with
hallmark pathologic structures (major protein) highlights pathways of injury and response to injury: senile
plaques (amyloid beta peptides), neurofibrillary degeneration (paired helical filament-tau), Lewy bodies and
neurites (phospho-alpha-synuclein), and phospho-TDP-43 inclusions.
We will test the hypothesis that multiplex analysis of CSF particles as well as subcellular, cellular, and
regional mapping will provide key biological and medical insights into CSF proteins discovered by de novo
proteomic analysis of CSF in Project 1. The same probes will be applied to CSF LP and EV using flow
cytometry, and to brain regions using Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging (MIBI)."
10792939,"Abstract
The pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease are the neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques that form
in gray matter regions of the cerebral cortex. Misfolded and aggregated proteins reside within those
pathological features, which may to be central to the neuronal death that causes regional atrophy, dementia,
and ultimately death. The cerebrospinal fluid that bathes the central nervous system is the fluid most proximal
to the disease and has been the focus of biomarker discovery for more than 30 years. There are two important
gene products that are present in cerebrospinal fluid and have been shown to be predictive of disease activity
and cognitive decline in patients that present with mild cognitive impairment: (1) the amyloid precursor protein,
which gives rise to Aβ(1-42) and other fragments, and (2) tau, which has many phosphorylation sites. The
deposition of Aβ(1-42) as amyloid aggregates appears to lead to the death of adjacent neurons. The resulting
injury increases the amount of tau protein released into the cerebrospinal fluid. From previous biomarker
studies of Aβ proteins and tau, it seems likely that the entire disease process, from Aβ(1-42) deposition to cell
death, is orchestrated differently than in other neurodegenerative diseases. As a result, it is a compelling
hypothesis that novel biomarkers, which may be mediators of disease, are present in the cerebrospinal fluid
and could add more information over the current biomarkers used in the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease.
There have been previous attempts to use discovery proteomics to identify proteins that are differentially
expressed in cerebrospinal fluid in patients with Alzheimer’s disease compared with controls and there have
been few efforts to expand upon these studies in a clinically meaningful way. However, some of these efforts
have identified the presence of additional fragments of amyloid precursor protein [i.e., in addition to Aβ(1-42)]
and other proteins, which suggests that post-translational changes may be important in the formation of
amyloid, the dysfunction of neuronal synapses, and the subsequent death of neurons.
In this project entitled, “Identification of mass spectrometric targets and development of multiplex assays for
disease management,” our objective is to identify the post-translational modifications that lead to altered
LP/EV concentration, molecular weight, and stability in cerebrospinal fluid. Part of the reason that the
clinical translation of Aβ(1-42), tau, and phosphorylated tau as cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers took decades
was that reproducible assays were not available early on. As a result, another overarching goal of this project
is to develop precise, transferable, validated targeted proteomic assays to quantify proteins in
cerebrospinal fluid that can be used to investigate disease mechanism and predict poor outcomes."
10808348,"Project Summary/Abstract: Exploring SGLTs as Theranostic Targets for Cancer Metastasis
Cancer requires substantial energy that is commonly provided by increased glucose transport and metabolism.
Clinically, this is evaluated using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging of the18F-labeled glucose
analog 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ([18F]FDG). [18F]FDG enters cells primarily via facilitative glucose
transporters known as GLUTs, which are overexpressed in some human cancers. [18F]FDG cannot be used to
probe the sodium-dependent glucose transporters (SGLTs), the other different family of transporters, in
cancers. In fact, the role of SGLTs in breast, prostate, lung, head/neck, brain, pancreas, colon, cervix, and
ovary is only now starting to be recognized. Given that SGLT expression is even higher in metastasis than in
primary tumors, we propose they could be theranostic targets for metastatic disease as SGLTs are able to
concentrate glucose and its analogs intracellularly many fold their extracellular concentration. To evaluate this
we created a brand new compound called 6FIGA (Fluorescent Iodinated Glucose Analog, modified at the 6
position carbon) which is selectively transported by SGLTs. It can be made with the therapeutic radionuclide
131I to deliver lethal radiation to cancer cells while having a low systemic concentration that minimizes toxicities.
Further, SGLT function and therapy planning could be informed by PET imaging using the chemically-identical
agent made with the 124I isotope. In addition, we have made it with stable iodine for fluorescent assays and
imaging spanning from microscopy to murine in vivo studies. Herein we propose to use this novel trifunctional
agent to evaluate SGLTs as a theranostic target for cancer metastasis. Significantly, targeted radionuclide
therapy could solve the efficacy problem due to tumor heterogeneity. Radiation originating in SGLT-expressing
cells penetrates multiple cell lengths and even kills neighboring cells that lack SGLTs. Our preliminary work
shows that 6FIGA is transported selectively by SGLTs in representative metastatic breast and prostate cancer
cell lines and an in vivo murine flank human prostate cancer tumor demonstrated 6FIGA concentrating with low
off-target uptake. In this exploratory project we will use 6FIGA to explore SGLTs as potential theranostic
targets via the aims: 1 Evaluate the time courses and biodistributions of [124I]6FIGA in in vivo metastatic
models, measuring tumor and normal tissue concentration time courses and associated dosimetry. We
hypothesize that [124I]6FIGA assays SGLT activity and provides different information than [18F]FDG. 2 Conduct
proof-of-concept for targeted treatment using [131I]6FIGA radionuclide therapy, assessing overall survival and
imaging response to therapy. Correlative studies will be performed, including immunohistochemistry and ex
vivo fluorescence imaging, in order to quantify the relation between uptake and protein expression levels. Thus,
we will demonstrate the potential of SGLTs as theranostic targets."

Disruption of normal mitochondrial bioenergetics and oxidative phosphorylation represents an early event during
oncogenesis by changing the energy metabolism of precancerous and cancerous cells. Phenethyl isothiocyanate
(PEITC), a natural compound present in cruciferous vegetables, has been shown to inhibit the development of
several types of cancer in animal models. PEITC has been shown to inhibit oxidative phosphorylation and to
induce cancer cell apoptosis through a mitochondria-dependent mechanism and ROS formation, suggesting the
role of mitochondrial bioenergetic function and redox homeostasis in oncogenesis. This provides the rationale
for conjugating PEITC to a targeting agent that drives it into mitochondria to specifically study the role of
mitochondrial function and ROS formation in lung cancer development and to increase the efficacy of PEITC.
Preliminary studies demonstrate that mitochondria-targeted PEITC (Mito-PEITC) is a significantly more potent
inhibitor of lung carcinogenesis in mice. We hypothesize that lung oncogenesis and metastasis depend on
mitochondrial respiration and that Mito-PEITC is a novel, potent inhibitor of lung carcinogenesis and metastasis
acting primarily through mitochondrial mechanisms. This hypothesis will be tested using three specific aims. Aim
1 will evaluate the preventive potential and mechanisms of action of Mito-PEITC in vitro. We will use Mito-PEITC
and lung cancer cells with genetically modified expression of the members of the mitochondrial electron transport
chain to decipher the oncogenic mechanism and evaluate the mechanisms of action of Mito-PEITC. Aim 2 will
determine preventive efficacy of Mito-PEITC on lung tumor initiation and progression in A/J mice. Aim 3 will
determine the in vivo mechanism and the efficacy of Mito-PEITC to inhibit lung cancer brain metastasis. We will
use state-of-the-art in vitro and in vivo assays, including small animal imaging technology to monitor the growth
of primary tumors (magnetic resonance imaging) and engraftment of metastatic cells. Innovative approaches for
in vivo monitoring of changes in cancer cell bioenergetics and cellular oxidant production (bioluminescence
imaging) will be employed. Defining mitochondrial mechanisms of lung oncogenesis and brain metastasis and
developing a novel, well-tolerated efficacious agent for prevention and treatment of lung cancer will be highly
significant."

Motivation: Stroke is one of the leading causes of permanent motor disability in the United States, affecting
approximately 795,000 people a year. Despite the large population size of affected individuals, intense physical
therapy remains the only significant intervention with limited impact on moderated to severe paresis. Therefore,
the development of novel and effective therapeutic approaches is necessary for these patients. Neurostimula-
tion, like deep brain stimulation (DBS), is a promising approach that could extend recovery beyond physical
therapy. A possible target for DBS to treat post-stroke motor deficits is the motor thalamus, which is a thalamic
relay with outgoing excitatory connectivity to sensory/motor cortices.
Project Goal: Here we propose to design a new DBS approach targeting the motor thalamus to improve motor
output following stroke. For this, we will perform a mechanistic-driven identification of the optimal target of
stimulation within the motor thalamus and optimization of the stimulation parameters in monkeys.
Hypothesis: we hypothesize that 1) stimulation of specific nuclei of the motor thalamus potentiates motor out-
put by increasing excitability of cortical motoneurons via thalamocortical synaptic excitatory projections; 2) a
restricted set of stimulation parameters enables potentiation of motor output that persists after stroke in anes-
thetized monkeys; and 3) in awake monkeys with chronic stroke improves motor performances.
Approach: We developed the first monkey model of stroke within the internal capsule (IC), a deep white matter
brain structure that hosts the cortico-spinal tract (CST) and that is often damaged after stroke. We will leverage
this model first in anesthetized monkeys to identify optimal stimulation targets and parameters. For this, we will
position a stimulating probe in IC and one in each nucleus of the motor thalamus. We will first establish the
optimal stimulation nucleus by elucidating mechanisms of action of stimulation and by identifying which nucleus
must be stimulated to maximize: 1) cortical evoked potentials (CEPs) in the motor cortex, and 2) motor evoked
potentials (MEPs) triggered by IC or motor cortex stimulation when paired with DBS. We will then compare
MEPs with continuous or burst DBS. We expect that the ventral laterolateral (VLL) nucleus will maximally po-
tentiates MEPs and CEPs when the CST are intact and after a stroke. Finally, we will test the effects of the
optimal stimulation target and parameters during behavioral upper-limb tasks in awake animals with chronic
stroke. We expect that also in this case VLL stimulation will improve strength and motor performances.
Preliminary data: We developed and piloted the necessary techniques: i) we have designed a robot-assisted
neurosurgery approach to lesion the IC without damaging the sensorimotor cortex; ii) we have piloted the ef-
fects of VLL stimulation in anesthetized animals; and iii) we have characterized a chronic model of IC stroke.
Perspective: These pre-clinical monkey data will provide critical evidence to support future human studies
involving implantation of FDA approved leads in the motor thalamus in people with lesions of the CST.

Neuroimaging has expanded our understanding of brain development from childhood into early adulthood.
Adolescent substance use trends have shifted over time, but use of cannabis, alcohol, and tobacco remain
prevalent, typically starting during teenage years, when serious mental health conditions also tend to emerge.
Although physical health is at its lifetime peak, emerging concerns for teens include increasing rates of
depression, anxiety, social isolation, suicidal ideation, and excessive use of screen media. The extent to which
early substance use and other environmental exposures may place youth at risk for altered neurodevelopment
and adverse outcomes remains poorly understood.
A diverse sample of 11,878 9-10 year olds was enrolled from 21 sites across the ABCD Study consortium, and
554 were enrolled at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU), under RFA-DA-15-015. All participants
underwent a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive
neuropsychological testing, bioassays, careful assessment of substance use, mental health, physical health,
culture and environment, and mobile monitoring every 2 years. Interim in-person annual interviews and
biannual telephone or mobile app assessments provide refined temporal resolution of behaviors, development,
and life events with minimal participant burden. Intensive efforts are made to retain the vast majority of
participants through adolescence and beyond and retention rates thus far are very high.
Data, securely and privately shared with the scientific community, will enable investigators to: (1) describe
individual developmental trajectories in terms of neural, cognitive, emotional, and academic functioning, and
influencing factors; (2) develop national standards of healthy brain development; (3) investigate the roles and
interaction of genes and the environment on development; (4) examine how physical activity, sleep, screen
time, sports injuries (including traumatic brain injuries), and other experiences affect brain development; (5)
determine and replicate factors that influence the onset, course, and severity of mental illnesses; (6)
characterize the relationship between mental health and substance use; and (7) specify how use of different
substances (e.g., cannabis, alcohol, tobacco, caffeine) affects developmental outcomes, and how neural,
cognitive, emotional, and environmental factors influence substance use risk."

Multiple sclerosis is a debilitating disease usually diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 49 years with no
curative options, resulting in a focus on rehabilitation strategies to manage symptoms, restore function, and
improve quality of life. Physical activity, particularly exercise training, is considered one of the best
rehabilitation strategies for comprehensive multiple sclerosis management. Despite strong evidence of the
safety and benefits of physical activity and exercise in this population, persons with multiple sclerosis do not
engage in sufficient levels of physical activity. Physical therapists are well positioned and have the expertise to
facilitate physical activity and exercise participation for persons with multiple sclerosis. However, physical
therapy is underutilized, particularly in people with more mild multiple sclerosis symptoms, when the best
results may be achieved. A newly developed proactive physical therapy delivery model may help persons with
multiple sclerosis increase and maintain their physical activity and exercise behaviors. The proposed study
involves 1) a randomized controlled trial to evaluate outcomes of feasibility in the four metrics of process,
resources, management, and scientific outcomes, and 2) an assessment of the immediate and sustained
treatment effect of the physical therapy model compared to a waitlist control on accelerometer-measured
physical activity. The feasibility trial will be conducted with a sample of 40 persons with multiple sclerosis
randomized to either the intervention or waitlist control group. Participants will complete assessments at
baseline, post-intervention (6 months), and follow-up (10 months). Participants will complete a summative
evaluation, including surveys and one-on-one semi-structured interviews, to assess satisfaction, acceptability,
feasibility, and appropriateness of the physical therapy delivery model. The proposed feasibility study,
interviews, and implementation assessments will directly lead to the submission of an R01 to test the efficacy
of an appropriately powered randomized controlled trial and to identify context-specific barriers and facilitators
to the successful uptake of this physical therapy model in clinical settings. The dissemination of the results of
this feasibility study can lead to improvements in physical therapy delivery for persons with multiple sclerosis."

Asthma is a debilitating lung disease marked by reversible airway obstruction that affects over 5% of the US
population and is growing in prevalence. In the majority of cases of asthma, allergic inflammation around the
bronchial airways contributes to disease pathogenesis. A key pathway in the initiation of allergic immune
responses is elicited by antibodies of the IgE isotype. In allergic individuals, IgE antibodies are produced with
specificity for components of harmless environmental substances, termed allergens. However, the mechanisms
responsible for the production of IgE specific for allergens inhaled into the respiratory tract (aeroallergens) remain
poorly characterized. One of the major limitations in understanding the process of allergic sensitization through
the respiratory tract has been technical difficulty in direct studies of IgE producing plasma cells and their B cell
precursors. My laboratory has developed methodology enabling the sensitive identification of these rare IgE-
expressing cells by flow cytometry and microscopy. The focus of this project is to apply this robust methodology
to study the generation of IgE-expressing cells following aeroallergen exposure through the respiratory tract. In
order to do a detailed analysis of tissues involved in respiratory tract immunity, we will study mouse models of
allergic airway disease. The overall objective of this project is to study the cellular response leading to the
production of IgE in allergic sensitization through the respiratory tract. The specific aims of this study are to: 1)
characterize the generation and fate of IgE B cells and plasma cells and their tissue localization in different
models of aeroallergen sensitization and 2) determine the relative abundance of allergen-specific IgE B cells and
plasma cells compared with other isotypes (IgM, IgG, and IgA) and establish their clonal relationships. The
results from these studies will provide important insights into IgE production after allergen exposure via the
respiratory tract. More broadly, this study will increase our understanding of the ways in which we may develop
sensitization versus tolerance to aeroallergens."

when controlling for sociodemographic factors, country of origin, age and lifetime traumatic exposure. This will
involve evaluating the efficacy of Health Tribe (peer-to-peer support) participation in combination with receipt of
recommendations based on the Health Risk Report. Successful completion of the Phase I objective will provide
proof-of-concept for the ability of InovCares health assessment tool to identify risk factors to enable behavioral
modifications. Additional development of this technology in Phase II will involve assessing its feasibility to
integrate with teleultrasound for the timely detection of conditions that may compromise fetal health."

Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is one of the earliest and most noticeable symptoms associated with
Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and other AD Related Dementias (ADRD). There is no cure for ADRD, and
conventional treatments only target more disease stages. Notably, MCI associated with AD typically occurs after
AD biomarkers (related to β-amyloid and tau pathologies) are detectable in patients, creating a narrow window
prior to MCI-AD onset and diagnosis, termed preclinical AD, where interventions slowing MCI onset have the
potential to greatly improve patient quality of life and dramatically reduce costs of AD care at large. However,
developing pharmaceutical treatments for preclinical AD must meet high safety margins given the duration of
treatment, and past attempts have failed to show efficacy. Recently, approvals of antidepressants like ketamine
and brexanolone (both 2019) and the resurgence of psychedelic research has highlighted the power of
neuroplasticity modifiers – compounds driving the creation or modulation of synaptic connections within the brain
– for modifying neurological function to impact mental health. Engaging neuroplasticity mechanisms through
pharmacological means or holistic approaches (i.e. exercise & dietary changes) has been shown to positively
enhance cognition and memory. Notably, some of the most potent neuroplasticity modulators are Natural
Products (NPs) derived from medicinal plants and herbs used by humans for centuries. As such, NPs have been
the subject of numerous studies investigating their potential to improve cognition and progression to MCI in AD.
However, incomplete descriptions of NP molecular targets, mechanisms of action, stability, purity, potency and
bioavailability have largely prevented their development as clinical drug candidates. What’s more, the quantity
of known NPs found in botanical products numbers in the tens of thousands. To identify and develop
psychoactive natural products that impact neuroplasticity and can slow MCI onset, Sensorium Therapeutics is
expanding the capacity of their Biodynamic Discovery PlatformTM (BDP). Our novel BDPTM leverages AI-assisted
analysis of ethnobotanical data and medicinal chemistry coupled with in vitro high-throughput screening using
human iPSCs to provide an effective drug development pipeline for identifying novel NPs as MCI-AD treatments.
Our platform has already led to the identification of a leading natural product drug candidate for depression and
anxiety. Additionally, we have identified a class of botanically-derived alkaloid compounds that have favorable
CNS pharmacological profiles, excellent chemical and in vitro safety, and are linked to improving cognitive
function in humans. The overarching goal of this Fast Track proposal is to expand our BDPTM to include scalable
cellular/neuronal readouts of neuroplasticity while incorporating MCI-AD in vitro models (Phase I) and identify
and validate NP candidate efficacy for MCI-AD treatment (Phase II). Successful completion of this Fast Track
project will generate NP candidates for further development and demonstrate efficacy for Sensorium’s
Biodynamic Discovery PlatformTM in identifying lead candidates for MCI-AD treatments."

Previous support from NIH SBIR and Coulter Foundation awards allowed the CryoCrate team to develop a first-
in-class biocompatible cryopreservation medium product, trademarked as OdinSol®, that provides enabling and
efficient options for biobanking urgently needed for the development and implementation of cell-based
therapeutics and tissue engineering in personalized medicine.
The OdinSol® technology removes the need for any toxic cell permeating cryoprotectant used in nearly all
existing cryopreservation methods, secures long-term storage in regular -80oC deep freezers, and significantly
improves the cryopreservation efficiency for cell-based therapeutic materials (e.g., iPSC-derived cells or tissues).
Based on our former experience in FDA 510(k) submission, in this project, we organized the collaboration with
our regulatory consultant (Cardinal Health), contract manufacturing organizations (Bryllan), contract research
organization (WuXi AppTec), academic co-inventor (University of Missouri – Kansas City Vision Research
Center), to achieve the following milestones:
I. The production of OdinSol® meets GMP qualifications and biocompatibility assessment shows
 compliance with FDA guidance for 510(k) submission as a storage device for transplantable tissues;
II. The in vitro and in vivo evaluation of safety and efficacy demonstrates the OdinSol® technology to be
 superior to existing cryopreservation protocols with respect to preserving viability and function of
 novel cell-based therapeutic materials for regenerative medicine;
III. Based on those qualifications, we will complete of the 510(k) submission and finalize of the production
 line based on further FDA feedback before the end of the project period.
We expect future clinical use of the OdinSol® technology within three years after the FDA clearance, providing
the regenerative medicine industry with a highly efficient biocompatible cryostorage platform."
10821070,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Heat waves cause a disproportionate number of deaths in the elderly relative to any other age group. Most of
the hospitalizations and deaths in this population during heat waves are due to cardiovascular and renal
complications linked to elevated thermal strain, and not directly due to hyperthermia per-se. Indoor cooling with
an air conditioner remains the most effective strategy to prevent the deleterious health effects of heat waves.
However, approximately 1 in 8 Americans do not have in-home air conditioners, and the rising household energy
costs potentially makes air conditioning unaffordable for lower-income individuals. Also, power outages and
industry/government-imposed rolling blackouts, along with COVID-19 related closures of public spaces, threaten
region-wide access to air conditioning at times when it is most needed. Thus, there is a clear need to identify
non-air conditioning dependent cooling modalities to attenuate excessive elevations in core body temperature
and associated cardiovascular and renal stress in the elderly during heat wave conditions. The broad goal of
this project is to test the efficacy of low-energy cooling strategies directed at mitigating the adverse
thermal, cardiovascular, and potential renal consequences of heat wave exposure in the elderly. Aim 1
will test the hypothesis that skin wetting is an effective cooling modality to attenuate elevations in core body
temperature and accompanying cardiovascular stress during heat waves in the elderly, while fan use may be
detrimental depending on air temperatures and whether skin wetting is also employed. Aim 2 will determine if
recognized impairments in thermoregulatory capacity and aging-related reductions in kidney function in the
elderly will culminate in increased renal stress during heat wave exposures. The expected outcomes from this
work will have a direct positive impact on the elderly by evaluating the efficacy of practical, low-energy cooling
strategies that have the potential to save lives during heat waves. Further, we will provide critical information that
comprehensively characterizes the extent of renal stress during simulated heat waves in elderly individuals. This
research directly supports the mission of NIH in that we will uncover mechanistic physiological findings from
human participants with the goal of translating these findings to guide individuals, caregivers, and communities
on effective approaches to reduce heat related illness/injury. To ensure that this study was designed to maximize
clinical relevance and my scientific training, I assembled a strong interdisciplinary clinical research/mentoring
team consisting of expert integrative physiologists, physician-scientists, and a biostatistician. My primary goals
during this fellowship are to complete the proposed project, master several technical skills (e.g., cardiac
echocardiography, assessment of renal function/injury, etc.), improve my ability to obtain future extramural
research funding, and publish research findings in peer-reviewed medical and physiology journals."
10796723,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The promise of early detection to reduce the burden of cancer is an easily understood and highly desired
intervention point in the cancer continuum. Recent developments of multicancer detection (MCD) technologies
have fueled already strong interest in their use, well in advance of compelling data describing the impact of
MCD-based screening on cancer mortality. In addition to limited data available on sensitivity and lead time to
assess these MCD tests, the complexities of implementing them in a real-world clinical environment require
careful evaluation to assess the frequency of achieving resolution of a positive MCD test (i.e., a specific cancer
diagnosis), the nature, timeline and cost of those procedures, and the potential to increase cancer worry and
health inequities. To help to address these critical caps in data, the Cancer Screening Research Network
(CSRN) will be a cooperative group structure with the expertise, infrastructure and access to appropriate
patient populations needed to provide high quality evidence on the value of MCD tests in real-world settings.
The goal for the Vanguard phase is to design and conduct a randomized controlled feasibility trial of two
promising MCD tests. The CSRN Communication and Coordinating Center (CCC) in conjunction with the
CSRN Statistics and Data Management Center (SDMC) and the NCI will lead and support this critical national
effort. Our specific objectives are to: (1) Provide exceptional scientific and clinical expertise in the design and
implementation of multicenter cancer screening trials, and particularly randomized trials evaluating MCD
assays. (2) Develop the organizational structure and administrative relationships to assure CSRN success.
(3) Develop and maintain effective communication channels and materials to promote CSRN success (4)
Support CSRN ACCESS sites in their recruitment and retention efforts. By these efforts, the CSRN will assess
the feasibility of and establish the core infrastructure needed to conduct future full-scale trials of MCD tests and
other cancer screening studies. Through the efforts of the Vanguard phase, the CSRN will create the
infrastructure, data and learnings needed to support full-scale trials and additional observational studies of the
most promising MCD tests and other cancer screening approaches."

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common cause for vaginal discharge and highly prevalent among women of
reproductive age. The cost of BV sequelae is estimated at $3.7 billion per annum in North America.
Microbiologically, BV is characterized by a shift in bacteria from mostly lactobacilli to complex communities of
anaerobes. BV is typically diagnosed in the clinic using a set of four clinical findings known as Amsel criteria.
The gold standard for BV diagnosis relies on Gram stains of vaginal fluid using Nugent scoring of bacterial
morphotypes. Recent advances in molecular detection of bacterial targets have resulted in nucleic acid
amplification tests that target combinations of bacteria due to the microbiological heterogeneity of BV. While
molecular technologies offer advantages such as detection and quantification of fastidious bacteria, they rely on
access to a skilled certified lab and assay turnaround time can delay treatment or result in loss to follow-up.
There is a clinical need for a rapid diagnostic that is easy-to-use, sensitive, and specific for BV that can be used
in point-of-care (POC) settings.
Small molecule metabolites in vaginal fluid have the potential to be developed as biomarkers to be used in rapid
diagnostic platforms, but no BV diagnostic products are available using metabolites as biomarkers. We have
identified several metabolite biomarkers in preliminary studies conducted in a monomorphic population. The
excellent performance of the discovered biomarkers is extremely promising as some individual metabolites have
area under the receiving operating curve (AUC) of 95% or higher. We believe it will be possible to combine 2 of
these biomarkers to boost this performance even further. A critical next step is to validate these candidate
biomarkers in a population that is diverse in ethnicity, racial composition, and economic background to ensure
that representative metabolites are selected prior to further product development. In Aim 1, we will validate these
biomarkers in 120 women with vaginal symptoms or at high risk for BV. Concentrations of a targeted set of
metabolites will be measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The diagnostic performance of each
individual metabolite will be compared with conventional methods of BV diagnosis, Amsel and Nugent criteria.
Metabolites that have the highest diagnostic accuracy will be selected for development of a metabolite-based
diagnostic assay for BV in Aim 2. In Aim 2, we will develop and compare the diagnostic performance of a two
metabolite BV diagnostic assay with an existing FDA-approved POC that relies on the enzyme sialidase and an
FDA-approved molecular test. At the end of STTR Phase I, we expect to have a highly sensitive and specific
small molecule metabolite-based BV diagnostic assay that performs as well or outperforms the existing POC,
and molecular diagnostic tests based on diagnostic accuracy."
10820645,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common type of dementia, imposes a substantial, global, socioeconomic
burden. An estimated 6.5 million Americans aged 65 and older are living with AD, the most prevalent form of
dementia. In the US, estimated health-care payments in 2022 for all patients with AD or related dementias
(ADRD) amount to $345 billion. Without the means to identify high risk individuals, many will find care too little
and too late: more than half of individuals with dementia or cognitive decline have not been diagnosed. There
is a need for accessible and inexpensive early predictive biomarkers of memory loss and/or incident ADRDs to
facilitate the early identification of high-risk individuals, providing the time necessary to make meaningful
lifestyle changes to slow or prevent disease progression. This is especially important since markers like tau or
beta-amyloid are primarily markers of existing, not impending disease. Emerging evidence suggests that
erythrocyte (RBC) omega-3 fatty acid (FA) levels may serve as an early signal of impending disease up to 5
years before AD/ADRD develops. As a clinical laboratory that specializes in providing FA measurements,
interpretation and customized behavioral interventions, OmegaQuant Analytics (OQA) supports a large and
growing customer base of researchers, clinicians, businesses, and individuals. Through a partnership with the
Fatty Acid Research Institute (FA expertise; biostatistical support; data access), we propose to develop a
highly predictive FA-based profile using an innovative approach leveraging existing prospective cohort data. To
do this, we will determine the extent to which it is possible to predict memory loss and/or incident all-cause
dementia from an RBC FA signature. We will harmonize data from 19,922 individuals with assessment of
incident all-cause dementia or an assessment of memory (e.g., Wechsler Memory Scale), with complete FA
profile data and with an average of 10+ years of follow-up. We will then apply statistical / machine learning
algorithms to determine the extent to which we can predict incident ADRD or a change in memory from FAs,
with separate models for high-risk subgroups, including racial/ethnic groups [Blacks, Hispanics]. Results will be
used to create a Fatty Acid Memory Index (FAMI) and Fatty Acid Dementia Index (FADI). We will create
consumer-friendly interpretative reports for FAMI and FADI including actionable steps to change dietary FA
behaviors to potentially modify memory loss/ dementia risk. We will determine if other clinical laboratories or
clinicians are willing to pay at least $30/test (wholesale price) for each test [Profitability pathway #1 (PP#1)].
We will also determine individual consumers’ willingness to pay OQA directly $50/test (retail price per test) for
either FAMI or FADI (PP#2). Proof of concept feasibility will set us up for a larger-scale prospective study and
improved machine-learning/modelling in Phase II. Ultimately, we hope to generate two simple, early-warning
tests that will allow for targeted intervention of individuals at high-risk for developing memory loss and/or
dementia, ultimately leading to substantial reductions in the prevalence and societal burden of this disease."
10820667,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a subtype of breast cancer that is highly invasive, has limited treatment
options, and is prone to recurrence and metastasis. The standard of care for TNBC patients involves neoadjuvant
chemotherapy, followed by surgery and radiotherapy. Even with recent advances in immuno-oncological (I-O)
treatments, the 5-year survival rate for metastatic TNBC is only 12%. Moreover, only some (~20% of TNBC
patients) are eligible for chemo-immunotherapy combination treatment so that a significant patient remaining
population will not benefit from current treatments. Therefore, novel effective therapeutic approaches must be
developed that complement standard treatments for TNBC and enhance immune responses. To meet this urgent
clinical need, we are developing non-pharmacological, wearable, non-invasive, commercially viable medical
devices for treating metastatic TNBC. Using induced electric field (iEF) technology with electromagnetic fields of
intermediate frequency (< 500 kHz) and low intensity (µV/cm–mV/cm), we have already shown in a preclinical
TNBC model in immunocompetent mice that iEF treatment results in a significant decrease in distant
metastases to the lungs, primary tumor burden, infiltration of pro-metastatic tumor associated M2-like
macrophages, and increased infiltration of activated cytotoxic T cells in the primary tumor microenvironment
(TME). This novel iEF therapy elicits potent beneficial and selective biological response by modifying
endogenous electric fields (and potential differences) that exist both at the tissue and cellular levels, by
introducing exogenous voltages and electric fields that hinder tumor growth and metastasis to the lungs. Both
our in vitro and in vivo data support our hypothesis, and the overall goal of this application is to transition our
promising results closer yet to the clinic by combining iEF treatment in mouse models, with standard of care
chemotherapy in advanced TNBC. We will accomplish this goal by (1) determining and establishing the safety
profile of iEF therapy, assessing any adverse effects of iEF therapy in wild-type immunocompetent mice,
identifying any observable effects on standard analytes from blood analysis, and (2) determining the ability of
iEF therapy combined with standard of care chemotherapeutic agents in established mouse models that
recapitulate breast cancer tumor growth, progression, and pulmonary metastasis. We will determine in
vivo the efficacy of standalone IEF therapy in decreasing tumor growth and pulmonary metastasis, and then
assess the efficacy of combining iEF treatment with standard of care chemo-monotherapies (paclitaxel,
capecitabine) in shrinking the primary tumor and preventing pulmonary metastasis. Collectively, this work has
the potential for saving the lives of patients with metastatic TNBC who are not responsive to current standard of
care, and will contribute to lessening the morbidity of current treatments by potentially lowering the required dose
of chemotherapeutic agents."

Autologous chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR T) cell therapy poses logistical and economical
challenges despite curative potential. Donor-derived allogeneic off-the-shelf (OTS) cell therapies
have become the holy grail of cell therapy as they can be mass-produced and are immediately
available to cancer patients at affordable prices. However, current OTS strategies involve
complex manufacturing process and gene-editing with safety concerns such as carcinogenesis
risk. Non-αβ T cell-based OTS strategies such as NK cells have potency concerns as they lack
persistence and durability. Immunebro Therapeutics is developing a simple and novel
platform technology to produce donor-derived αβ T cell-based OTS products named
engager T cells. Engager T cells are engineered donor T cells expressing and secreting an
artificial modular protein that can 1) target donor T cells to a desired cancer target and 2) curb
donor T cells' alloreactivity of inducing graft versus host disease (GvHD). Donor derived engager
T cell is a simple solution for OTS T cell therapy with no need of gene editing. It involves
a well-established and much less complex manufacturing process in comparison to gene
edited OTS CAR T cells currently in development. Preliminary data have demonstrated that
donor derived CD19-targeting engager T cells have low xenogeneic GvHD risk and are efficacious
in treating xenograft CD19+ leukemia mouse model. However, in a side-by-side comparison,
CD19 engager T cells are inferior to 2nd gen CD19 CAR T cells on efficacy due to the lack of co-
stimulation. As efficacy is crucial for regulatory and commercial success of any drug candidates,
this proposal is aiming at developing enhanced CD19 engager T cells with low GvHD risk.
Specific Aim 1 is to develop enhanced CD19 engager T cells and assess transgene expression
and secretion. Three strategies will be used to produce enhance CD19 engager T cells by 1) co-
expressing a CD19 CAR; 2) co-expressing T cell promoting cytokine IL15; 3) co-expressing
costimulatory factor 4-1BBL and CD80. Specific Aim 2 is to demonstrate one or more of the
enhanced CD19 engager T cells have low xenogeneic GvHD risk in immune deficient mice.
Specific Aim 3 is to demonstrate one or more of enhanced CD19 engager T cells have
comparable efficacy to 2nd gen CD19 CAR T cells. By the end of Phase 1 work, Immunebro will
have enhanced CD19 engager T cells as the first product prototype built from the simple and
novel OTS platform. This platform can be used to build a rich pipeline of OTS T cells
targeting a variety of cancers with less complex manufacturing, safer profile, and
comparable or better efficacy than gene edited OTS CAR T cells currently in development."
10822312,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT
Self-monitoring (SM) is an essential component gold-standard behavioral treatment of obesity (BOT) – the most
prevalent cause of morbidity and mortality in the US. Adherence to dietary self-monitoring is one of the strongest
consistent predictors of treatment outcomes. However, adherence to dietary SM is generally poor due to the
burden of the gold-standard SM approach (i.e., detailed tracking of all food & drink consumed). Discontinuation
of dietary SM is directly correlated with an end to weight loss, and it increases risk of weight regain. Improving
adherence to dietary SM is thus one of the most critical strategies for treating obesity. Alternative SM approaches
have been developed to reduce burden of dietary SM and thereby improve adherence. Prior work shows that
these SM alternatives have the potential to sustain SM adherence and improve weight loss in BOT. However,
there is no scientific consensus in how or when to apply SM alternatives for maximum benefit. To address this
critical gap, we will conduct a micro-randomized trial (MRT) to determine which SM strategy to apply for whom,
and at what point during BOT, to maximize SM adherence and weight loss. MRT involves repeated
randomizations at specific decision points, which enables data-driven optimization of the composition, tailoring,
and timing of behavioral interventions. By using MRT to compare SM strategies over time within individuals and
evaluating factors that influence their efficacy, we can enable broadly-applicable SM recommendations to
improve BOT. We can then use these data to develop algorithms that can repeatedly and automatically adapt
SM recommendations based on each individual’s performance and needs. Our MRT will test the effects of gold-
standard dietary SM and 4 SM alternatives on SM adherence and weight loss during a 24-week BOT. A diverse
sample of adults with overweight/obesity will receive our established, online BOT for 24 weeks. At program start,
and every 2 weeks thereafter, participants will be randomized to one of five SM approaches, for a total of 12
independent randomizations per person. The SM approaches to be tested are: gold-standard full dietary SM of
all foods/drinks and their kcals; reduced-frequency full dietary SM (3 d/wk); SM of dietary lapses only;
smartwatch-based monitoring of energy intake; and SM of body weight only via smart scale. Data from this MRT
will have tremendous scientific and practical impacts; we will evaluate the efficacy of alternative SM approaches
on SM adherence and weight loss as well as how each strategy works across individual differences (e.g., sex),
social determinants of health (e.g., financial resource strain), and time-varying treatment (e.g., week of treatment)
factors. We will use reinforcement learning, a machine learning approach, to create an adaptive SM-selection
algorithm that automatically determines the SM approach most likely to maximize outcomes for a given individual
throughout treatment. This proposal will achieve both scientific and practical public health benefit by using a
sophisticated data-driven approach to understand the factors that influence SM adherence during behavioral
obesity treatment, and provide an algorithm to optimize SM in future clinical and research applications."

 Our research program centers on the regulation of hemostasis and thrombosis, heavily informed by the
study of human patients with associated genetic disorders. The current proposal will continue this work, with a
specific focus in four areas: 1) characterization of endothelial cell heterogeneity across diverse vascular beds
and its role in the pathogenesis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), hemolytic uremic syndrome, and
other vascular disorders, 2) application of comprehensive deep mutational scanning methods, using von
Willebrand factor (VWF) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) as model hemostasis proteins, to guide
precision medicine genome sequence interpretation, 3) directed molecular evolution of novel serine protease
inhibitor (SERPIN) proteins with unique new properties, providing valuable insight into protein structure/function
relationships as well as identifying potential novel therapeutics, and 4) characterization of the full cargo
repertoires for the LMAN1 and SURF4 cargo receptors, identifying potential overlapping cargo receptors, and
probing unconventional protein secretion, with important implications for disorders of hemostasis and lipid
metabolism. We will identify and characterize a novel modifier gene for TTP susceptibility in the mouse, with
potential relevance for the variable presentation of TTP in humans. We will also characterize endothelial gene
expression across diverse vascular beds in vivo at the single cell level in mouse models for TTP and other
vascular disorders. Building on our past work, we will assemble complete datasets encompassing every possible
single amino acid substitution within PAI-1 and select domains of VWF to markedly improve the diagnosis of
human disorders due to inherited mutations in these genes and interpretation of clinical genome sequencing
data. These data will also provide a powerful resource for exploring structure–function relationships within these
proteins. We will also apply these approaches to probe the determinants of target protease specificity for PAI-1
and related members of the SERPIN gene family, with the potential to enable the development of novel
therapeutic reagents for the treatment of hemostatic and other human diseases. Finally, we will continue our
studies of the ER to Golgi cargo receptors, LMAN1/MCFD2, required for efficient secretion of coagulation factors
V and VIII, and SURF4, the cargo receptor for PCSK9 and other proteins regulating plasma cholesterol, to
identify the full repertoire of cargo for each receptor, as well as potential overlapping cargo receptors, with
important implications for patients with associated genetic disorders, as well as the development of future novel
therapeutics."
10786205,"Obligate intracellular bacteria in the order Rickettsiales cause emerging and potentially fatal infections. Orientia
tsutsugamushi, an etiologic agent of scrub typhus, is one of the deadliest rickettsial pathogens to humans. Yet,
it is severely understudied due, in part, to a lack of genetic manipulation tools. We have made important progress
on this front by developing protocols for Tn5 transposon mutagenesis and allelic exchange in O. tsutsugamushi.
We employed both approaches to insert a cassette that expresses mCherry and chloramphenicol acetyl
transferase into the O. tsutsugamushi chromosome. Using chloramphenicol selection and enrichment via
fluorescence activated cell sorting, we recovered a Tn5 mutant pool and an allelic exchange mutant in which we
knocked out a virulence factor. The Tn5 mutant pool and knockout mutant can be maintained under antibiotic
selection. In the R61 phase, we will further develop these genetic tools. In Aim 1, we will transform O.
tsutsugamushi with Tn5 transposomes to generate an insertional mutant library that we will catalog. In Aim 2,
we will complement this random mutagenesis approach by using allelic exchange to delete selected single-copy
O. tsutsugamushi genes. For this purpose, we prioritized a set of virulence factors whose functions we previously
defined to provide us with phenotypes to characterize in downstream R33 functional studies. While transposon
and allelic exchange mutagenesis are exciting “firsts” for this organism, neither can be used to target essential
genes in any other obligate intracellular bacterium. Therefore, in Aim 3 we will develop a riboswitch system that
allows us to control protein expression in transgenic O. tsutsugamushi using a diffusible ligand. This approach
can be used to block expression of any O. tsutsugamushi protein at any point during infection. Even if the protein
is essential, the mutant can be maintained in the presence of inducer to ensure viability. To establish proof-of-
principle for the riboswitch, we will target a gene that we have determined to be non-essential for viability. In the
R33 phase, we will use the newly developed tools to study O. tsutsugamushi pathogenesis. Up to four allelic
exchange mutants and the riboswitch mutant will be assayed alongside their wild-type counterparts for the ability
to modulate host cell functions. The knockout mutants will also be assessed for pathogenesis in the mouse
model. Up to two Tn5 mutants, prioritized based on the predicted functions of the genes that are disrupted, will
be included in the in vitro and in vivo studies. Overall, we will establish the genetic basis of virulence in O.
tsutsugamushi for the first time and provide valuable tools for the field. We envision that the proposed work will
bolster the field by encouraging an influx of researchers to study scrub typhus."
10791878,"Project Summary / Abstract
 Prostate cancer (PCa) is a clinically heterogeneous disease, with marked variability in patient
outcomes. Striking molecular heterogeneity may underlie the variable clinical course, with distinct molecular
subtypes recently identified. However, the biologic implications and translational impact of novel subtypes are
largely undefined, and there is a critical need for new models to study the biology and therapeutic
vulnerabilities of these novel subtypes of PCa. Recurrent mutations in SPOP occur in about 10% of PCa, and
define a distinct, core molecular class of PCa. However, the mechanisms by which SPOP mutation drives
prostate tumorigenesis in vivo remain unknown.
 Using multiple novel in vitro and in vivo models of SPOP mutant PCa, preliminary data demonstrate
that SPOP mutation drives neoplasia and invasive cancer in the mouse prostate. Furthermore, preliminary
studies in models in vitro and in vivo support that SPOP mutation activates the phospho-inositide 3-kinase
(PI3K) signaling pathway, with evidence for this regulation in human PCa. Interestingly, while PI3K activation
normally downregulates androgen receptor (AR) signaling, we show that SPOP mutation interrupts this
negative feedback by upregulating AR. These results suggest that SPOP mutation activates two known critical
signaling pathways in PCa – AR and PI3K signaling. Based on these preliminary findings, we hypothesize
that SPOP mutation drives prostate tumorigenesis through coordinate regulation of AR and PI3K
signaling pathways. To address this hypothesis, we will utilize novel in vitro and in vivo models and human
PCa samples to establish the mechanistic basis of SPOP regulation of PI3K/mTOR signaling, define the
relative importance of PI3K/mTOR and AR signaling in driving formation and progression of SPOP mutant
PCa, and determine the potential for therapeutic targeting of AR and PI3K/mTOR signaling in SPOP mutant
PCa.
 This project leverages unique in vivo and in vitro model systems to study a recently discovered key
subtype of PCa. Together, these studies will establish the importance of PI3K signaling and AR signaling in
PCa driven by SPOP mutations, define the critical signaling events in SPOP mutant PCa and the broader
applicability across PCa subtypes, and provide the foundation for clinical trials targeting this subclass."

The gold standard treatment for specific phobias is exposure therapy, wherein the individual
repeatedly faces the object of their fear. However, for many patients, the level of distress
prohibits them from either starting or completing exposure therapy. The objective of this
application is to use focal neuro-reinforcement based on decoded fMRI information (from the
ventral temporal temporal cortex) to reduce fear responses to feared animal stimuli (e.g.,
spiders, birds) in individuals with phobias, directly and unconsciously in the brain, without
repeatedly consciously exposing participants to their feared stimuli. Because the induced
representations are unconscious, participants do not experience negative emotional responses
and the procedure is double-blind placebo-controlled, thus providing a level of experimental
rigor not afforded to standard psychological therapies. Extending from our pilot data, we are
positioned to test the mechanisms and behavioral outcomes of a novel treatment for phobias
that at the same time advances our understanding of the role of consciousness in fear
responses and their change over time. The specific aims are to: (1) confirm that our method
engages the neurobiological target (amygdala reactivity to images of feared animals) in a
population of individuals with specific phobias of animals; (2) quantify how changes in amygdala
reactivity with neuro-reinforcement mediate changes in behavioral outcomes, as measured by
attentional capture, approach/avoidance behavior, or subjective fear ratings, immediately post
neuro-reinforcement; (3) assess the longer term effects four weeks after neuro-reinforcement;
and (4) explore the impact of three dosage levels of neuro-reinforcement to identify the optimal
dosage for future research. If proven effective, the results will inform applications for other fear-
related disorders, such as posttraumatic stress disorder, social anxiety disorder and panic
disorder."
10786860,"In spite of revolutionary advance in treatment for rifampicin- and multidrug-resistant (RR/MDR)
tuberculosis (TB), not all patients experience treatment success. Existing literature on other risk
factors for unfavorable TB treatment outcomes is limited in at least two important ways that
preclude an actionable evidence-based response. First, analyses are typically conducted using
predictive modelling or multivariable regression techniques that do not consider the underlying
causal structure of the factor and TB outcome. These approaches are inadequate for informing
interventions because they are not designed for causal inference and can lead to results that are
biased, and/or uninterpretable. Second, analyses of pre-treatment (i.e., baseline) factors do not
elucidate the mediating mechanism through which an unfavorable treatment outcome occurs. For
example, hepatitis C infection may lead to unfavorable tuberculosis treatment outcomes through
multiple pathways, including advanced liver disease that reduces bioavailability, as well as
suboptimal adherence to TB treatment. An effective adherence intervention would be expected
to improve outcomes under the latter scenario, but not the former. Therefore, analyses elucidating
the extent to which treatment adherence mediates the relationship between a given factor and
treatment outcomes will be required to inform relevant interventions for the patients that need
them most, thereby ensuring that all patients with TB benefit fully from the latest scientific
advances. We propose to elevate existing analyses of factors that lead to unfavorable TB
treatment outcomes through a novel framework for analyzing causes of unfavorable TB treatment
outcomes; one that is grounded in causal inference and evaluates adherence as a potentially
intervenable pathway. Our team of experts in TB, treatment adherence, and epidemiologic
methods will leverage a unique longitudinal dataset of 2,789 patients receiving MDR/RR-TB
treatment under routine program conditions in one of 17 countries on five continents. The overall
goal of the proposal is to generate more valid, relevant, and actionable data with regard to TB risk
factors, with the overall goal of informing interventions to reduce TB-related morbidity and
mortality. Specifically, we will (1) estimate the causal effect of key baseline exposures (e.g., HIV,
hepatitis B and/or C, low body mass index, substance use, cavitary disease with a highly positive
sputum smear, age, and gender) on end-of-treatment outcomes; and (2) determine the extent to
which each causal effect is mediated by suboptimal adherence to treatment, and examine other
potential mediating pathways."
10786679,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Asthma affects 1 in 12 U.S. adults and leads to 1.9 million emergency department (ED) visits and 500,000
hospitalizations annually. Patients of lower socioeconomic status, as well as members of racial and ethnic
minorities, are disproportionately more likely to suffer from asthma and experience worse health outcomes.
Medicaid is the primary source of health insurance for low-income persons. However, rates of provider
acceptance of Medicaid insurance remain low due to poor reimbursement rates, restricting access to needed
care. At the same time, Medicaid managed care plans have proliferated and now account for over two-thirds of
Medicaid enrollees. One strategy used by managed care organizations to reduce health costs is to limit
participating provider networks to steer beneficiaries to high-value providers. While state and federal policy
require minimum standards for network adequacy, recent evidence suggests that actual acceptance of Medicaid
among providers may be even lower than reported. The extent to which these restrictive provider networks
impact access to care among Medicaid beneficiaries with asthma and affect health outcomes remains unstudied.
We have assembled a multi-disciplinary team with expertise in asthma outcomes, policy evaluation, and claims
analysis to evaluate Medicaid provider network density, access to primary and specialty care, and ED visit and
hospitalization rates among a national sample of adult Medicaid beneficiaries with asthma. We will first construct
a claims-based measure of network density for each managed care plan by calculating the ratio of in-network
primary care providers and specialists to the number of beneficiaries enrolled in each managed care plan (Aim
1). Next, we will test the hypothesis that lower provider network density is associated with less frequent primary
and specialty care (Aim 2) and more frequent asthma-related ED visits and hospitalizations (Aim 3). This work
builds on the PI’s K23 findings and will serve as critical preliminary data for an R01 proposal to evaluate the
impact of managed care and state-level policies on asthma outcomes and health disparities, with a focus on
asthma patients in structurally marginalized communities. Our findings can be used by advocates and
policymakers to enhance standards for network adequacy and improve access to care among asthma patients
who experience health disparities."
10800540,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Radiation therapy may induce severe adverse events (AEs), and result in significant detriment to patients’ quality
of life, especially in head and neck, such as brain necrosis (BN), osteoradionecrosis (ORN), etc. It is important
to develop safer radiation therapy delivery models to minimize the risks of AEs. Spot scanning proton therapy
(SSPT) provides such an opportunity due to its unique physics characteristics, i.e., Bragg peak. But it also
introduces additional complexities since proton deposits most of the energy within a short distance, resulting in
high linear energy transfer (LET) compared to traditional photon therapy. Therefore, its relative biologically
effective (RBE) dose may vary significantly even for the same delivered physical dose. However, clinical use of
LET is limited because of the uncertainties and discrepancies in RBE modelling and calculation. Thus, current
SSPT plan evaluation exclusively relies on physical dose and ignores critical LET information. In this project, we
propose a novel tool of dose-LET volume histogram (DLVH) to visualize dose, LET, and structure volume in one
3D surface plot. While avoiding parameters with large uncertainties in RBE modelling, we will correlate AEs with
well-defined quantities of dose/LET to establish dose-LET volume constraints (DLVCs) at the organ level.
The follow-up medical images (CT, PET, and MRI etc.) showed that only a small portion of regions (seed spots)
at the AE sites originated from the synergistic effects of high dose and LET. These seed spots then expand to
nearby voxels with low dose/LET due to biological processes to form AE sites identified later in the follow-up
images. The inclusion of these voxels with low dose/LET will introduce lots of “noise” in the data analysis. Thus,
it is important to filter these “noise” from the true “signals” if we want to understand the dose-LET effects in AE
initialization. We propose a novel voxel-based method, dosimetric seed spot analysis, for studying the dose-LET
effects upon AE initialization at the voxel level. Seed spot analysis is akin to the patch-based methods in medical
image analysis and identifies seed spots. Empirical AE models will be developed via dosimetric seed spot
analysis with critical voxels selected by the population-based DLVC. The inter-patient variation will be considered
by the two-level mixed effect logistic regression model. The normal tissue complication probability models will
be established based on DLVCs and be applied in clinical practice for plan evaluation, and we will then develop
DLVH-based treatment planning using DLVC in SSPT to prospectively minimize the possible incidence of AEs.
The proposed project will be carried out by experts from Mayo Clinic, MD Anderson, New York Proton
Center/Memorial Sloan Kettering, and the University of Georgia. Our project will fill a critical technology void in
SSPT and is one of the largest in-vivo outcomes-driven studies to investigate the impact of LET. The success of
this study will become a major advancement to the current standard of care of SSPT plan evaluation and
optimization using physical dose alone, leading to precision radiation therapy and improved clinical outcomes."

In eukaryotic cells, the packaging of genomic DNA into nucleosomes represents the basic barrier to
transcription by RNA polymerase II (Pol II). The dynamic modulation of the magnitude of this barrier and the
degree of chromatin compaction constitute fundamental mechanisms of regulation of gene expression. Having
previously characterized the magnitude and mechanical properties of the nucleosomal barrier and their effect
on Pol II transcription, we aim to investigate the modulation of this barrier and its regulation of genome
accessibility to Pol II by environmental and cellular factors. We will do this by combining single-molecule
optical tweezers/fleezers (SM-OT) methods with high-resolution single particle cryo-electron microscopy
(cryo-EM), cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET), and quantitative in vivo fluorescence imaging.
 We have determined that nucleosomes display a trimodal distribution of unwrapping forces
corresponding to alternative nucleosome states that we hypothesize represent different barriers to
transcription by Pol II. We will investigate this intrinsic plasticity of nucleosomes and its modulation by factors
that promote their interconversion, including histone variants, post-translational modifications, and specific
transcriptional regulators (pioneer factors, elongation factors, and histone chaperones).
 Next, we will use our SM-OT assay to investigate how specific transcriptional regulators (e.g., FACT,
Spt4/5, Chd1) affect the dynamics of Pol II as it transcribes through the nucleosomal barrier. We will also
explore how histone PTMs, that have either activating or repressive roles on transcription, modify the
molecular trajectories and dynamics of individual Pol II molecules. Moreover, we will study how Pol II crosses
hexasomes and tetrasomes, both generated during moderate and intense transcription and that have been
proposed to play important roles in vivo. We will structurally characterize the nucleosome remodeling during
passage of Pol II by cryo-ET both in the presence or absence of transcription regulators.
 In eukaryotic cells, gene expression requires the passage of Pol II through arrays of nucleosomes
organized as chromatin. These arrays can adopt higher-order and more compacted structures that impose a
greater barrier to transcription by Pol II. Therefore, to understand how nucleosome arrays regulate genome
accessibility, we will study their mechanical stability using SM-OT unwrapping assays and characterize the
energetics of internucleosome interactions in these structures. We will also investigate the impact of
nucleosomal arrays on the transcription dynamics of individual Pol II using SM-OT in the absence and
presence of transcription regulators, and under different conditions that modulate chromatin compaction. We
will compare the dynamics of Pol II obtained in these in vitro experiments, with its dynamics in vivo. To this
end, we will introduce the strong nucleosome position sequence 601 into Drosophila embryos and monitor the
effect of single vs multiple nucleosomes on the rate of transcription by Pol II via quantitative live-cell imaging."
10804651,"East and Southern Africa is home to 6.2% of the world’s population but includes 54% of all people living with
HIV (PLWH). In this region, three out of five PLWH are women, and there is a particularly high burden of HIV
amongst adolescent girls and young women (AGYW). Over half of African women use family planning (FP)
services. Integration of HIV prevention and treatment with FP services holds promise for supporting progress
toward the UNAIDS 95-95-95 targets for testing, treatment, and prevention. Nonetheless, integration of even
basic HIV prevention and treatment services into FP clinics remains low and how best to integrate these
services is still unknown. In a previous trial, the Systems Analysis and Improvement Approach (SAIA), was an
effective implementation strategy for improving HIV counseling and testing in a small selection of FP clinics in
Mombasa County, Kenya when delivered by research staff. SAIA incorporates a cascade analysis tool,
sequential process flow mapping, and cycles of micro-intervention development, implementation, and
assessment to improve a care cascade. More data is needed to understand if SAIA is effective for also
improving linkage to HIV care and screening and linkage to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in FP clinics
when SAIA is delivered at scale by Kenyan public health workforce. The first objective of this study is to
conduct a cluster-randomized trial evaluating the effectiveness of SAIA versus control (usual procedures with
no specific intervention) for increasing HIV counseling, testing, linkage to HIV care, and screening and linkage
to PrEP in new FP clients and new and returning AGYW clients. There will be a particular focus on the HIV
prevention and treatment of AGYW in this study and any AGYW presenting for FP care will be prioritized.
Quantitative and qualitative data will be analyzed using the RE-AIM framework to evaluate the program’s
Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance. To understand how SAIA could be
integrated into national Ministry of Health policies and programs, activity-based costing will be conducted to
estimate the budget and program impacts of SAIA, scaled to a County level, from a Ministry of Health
perspective. It is hypothesized that compared to control, SAIA will be effective at increasing HIV counseling,
HIV testing, linkage to HIV care, and screening and linkage to PrEP for new FP clients and all new and
returning AGYW FP clients when delivered at scale by Kenyan public health staff. The implementation
evaluation, costing, and budget impact analysis will establish a road map for national-level implementation,
positioning Kenya as a global leader in integrating FP/HIV services."
10804652,"Project Summary
Binge eating (i.e., eating a large amount of food within a discrete time period accompanied by a sense of loss
of control over eating) is a key symptom of several eating disorders including bulimia nervosa (BN) and binge
eating disorder (BED). While cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can be an effective treatment approach for
binge eating, 40-50% of patients with BED and nearly 70% of patients with BN fail to achieve remission. A
growing body of research suggests that a key reason many patients may fail to benefit from CBT is suboptimal
rates of skill acquisition (i.e., the ability to successfully perform a skill learned in treatment) and utilization (i.e.,
the frequency with which a patient practices or employs therapeutic skills). Poor skill use and acquisition may
be particularly high among certain subsets of patients such as those who experience deficits in self-regulation.
This research suggests that treatment augmentations that could improve skill use and acquisition (particularly
for those who need additional support to succeed in CBT) could have high potential to enhance outcomes.
The NIMH has recently identified that digital health technologies (DHTs) have high potential to “promote
between-session skill practice/acquisition” and have selected this as a high priority research initiative (NOT-
MH-18-031). DHTs may be able to improve skill use and acquisition via several pathways, one of which is the
use of micro-interventions (i.e., short digital interventions delivered to people as they go about their daily lives).
Micro-interventions can range in complexity from something as simple as an automated reminder to practice a
therapeutic skill to advanced just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) systems that use machine learning or
other advanced algorithms to deliver personally tailored interventions in specific moments of need. Recent
pilot work from our team supports the utility of JITAIs as a way to improve skill utilization and acquisition when
used as a treatment augmentation but did not compare JITAIs to more simple automated reminder micro-
interventions. Additionally, our pilot work also found that frequent monitoring of skill use was in and of itself a
surprisingly effective method for encouraging skill practice. These results suggest that the added complexity of
JITAIs may not be necessary for all individuals to experience benefit from a DHT augmentation.
The ability to develop maximally effective DHTs requires the use of a larger clinical trial that can help to identify
which digital components (and at which complexity) are most effective at improving skill use and acquisition as
well clinical outcomes. We propose to use a 2 x 3 full factorial design in which 264 individuals with BN or BED
are assigned to one of six treatment conditions, i.e., representing each permutation of self-monitoring
complexity (Skills-Monitoring On vs. Skills-Monitoring Off) and micro-intervention complexity (No Micro-
Interventions vs. Automated Reminder Messages vs. JITAIs) as an augmentation to CBT. Results of the
component analysis set up future work to evaluate an optimized DHT containing only effective components
(which can be expected to have superior target engagement, efficacy, efficiency and disseminability)."

In-hospital cardiac arrests (IHCA) occur in over 350,000 adults in the United States each year, or one IHCA
every two minutes. Despite advances in management, patient survival rates with favorable neurologic function
remain low. Ventricular tachycardia (VT) is the most common initial shockable cardiac rhythm identified at the
onset of an IHCA and the most important determinant of survival is defibrillation in <3 minutes. While,
continuous electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring is the non-invasive gold standard method used to identify
VT, false alarms are extremely common. False VT not only impedes immediate identification of true VT and
lifesaving defibrillation, but contributes to alarm fatigue in clinicians. A widely held belief is that poor skin
electrode contact and/or default monitor settings cause false VT. As a result, clinical scientists have tried a
variety of interventions (e.g., customize alarm settings; daily skin electrode changes; disposable lead wires;
education) to decrease the number of false alarms. However, we found that fewer than 10% of false arrhythmia
alarms were due to poor signal quality (i.e., unanalyzable due to excessive noise, baseline wander, leads off).
Rather, our prior research shows that the vast majority of false alarms are due to poorly designed VT
algorithms. At the heart of the problem, are outdated databases used by monitoring manufacturers to develop
and test VT algorithms for use in bedside ECG monitors. Therefore, improvements to VT algorithms for use in
21st century bedside monitors has been stalled for decades. Recently, our group completed a multi-tiered,
multi-expert, ground truth, manual annotation, with three-person ascertainment of VT events testing a new VT
algorithm created by our group. The UCSF VT database represents the single largest human annotated
database in an intensive care unit (ICU) cohort in existence. We now aim to move these extensive efforts
forward to augment our original VT algorithm using a data driven artificial intelligence approach and increase
the generalizability of our VT algorithm by including step-down/telemetry unit patients. The specific aims are:
Aim 1. Leverage our human annotated VT database and machine learning (ML) approaches to identify novel
ECG features to create an “optimized” VT algorithm to predict VT associated and IHCA. Aim 2. Compare the
following VT algorithms: (1) v1 (signal processing); (2) ML/AI (Aim 1), and the hospital-based ECG monitors
(i.e., ICU and step-down/telemetry unit) using prospective data in 5,000 ICU (50% of total) and step-
down/telemetry patients (50% of total). Designing and testing clinically relevant VT algorithms that both
improve identification of true VT and forecast associated IHCA has important implications for reducing
preventable morbidity and mortality, reducing alarm fatigue, improving patient safety, enhancing nursing care
and ECG monitoring systems."

Low-income rural youth face negative social determinants of health and challenges in accessing health care.
School-Based Health Centers (SBHCs) are an innovative response to increase access, but their impact in rural
communities is not well documented. This project proposes a multilevel mixed-methods evaluation of an SBHC
network operating in 4 low-income rural counties in New York state. Run by the Bassett Healthcare Network,
these SBHCs are permanent, on-site, year-round and attend to the full range of healthcare needs (physical,
dental, mental, chronic and acute) at no out-of-pocket cost to patients. The setting permits a quasi-experimental
design to assess SBHC impact by comparing 16 school districts with SBHCs and 22 school districts without. The
project involves a multi-disciplinary team of Cornell University and Bassett researchers and community partners.
The project will use both qualitative data (from semi-structured interviews and focus groups) and quantitative
data (administrative data, survey, and patient healthcare visit data) and multilevel analytical methods to address
three aims: Aim 1. Assess the impact of SBHCs on healthcare utilization. We will assemble a panel dataset
of all patient visits to Bassett healthcare facilities over 12 years (2011-2022) to measure healthcare utilization
(frequency, location, services) for preventive care (e.g., well-care, vaccinations) and care for acute and chronic
conditions (e.g., asthma, mental health) among children in school districts with and without SBHCs. Aim 2.
Assess the impact of SBHCs on cross-agency collaboration. We will assess provision of social services in
the 4-county study area through document research, focus groups, interviews with school and community
leaders, and a survey of agency leaders. We will identify and measure factors that differentiate the level of cross-
agency collaboration among healthcare providers, community agencies, and local governments for each school
district. Aim 3. Assess the impact of SBHCs and cross-agency collaboration on school performance and
on community healthcare utilization. Combining data from multiple levels (patient, school district, and county)
will enable us to assess the different roles SBHCs play in addressing social determinants of health. Community
outcome measures include school attendance and broader community healthcare utilization. Study results will
enhance understanding of how SBHCs may shape health outcomes and contribute to individual and community
wellbeing to inform rural health policy."
10801931,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
A fundamentally new approach to molecular imaging is developed here, using high energy x-rays from a widely
available linear accelerator (Linac) for precise, multi-angle, multi-shaped, excitation of optical molecular probes
deep within tissue via the Cherenkov light. Cherenkov Excited Luminescence Metabolic Sensing (CELMS) was
developed to probe small molecule molecular tracers of pertinent tissue function in vivo, to take advantage of
the highly developed Linac x-ray sources for high-resolution molecular sensing in small animals. CELMS can be
used to image through 3 cm of tissue, preserving the exquisite molecular sensitivity of optical luminescence at
M-nM concentrations in vivo, while achieving millimeter level spatial sampling. This combination of ultra-high
molecular sensitivity, combined with deep penetrance and spatial sampling is far better than any comparable
small animal modality possible today. The thin sheets of x-rays used are shaped by multi-leaf collimators and
are swept over the tissue to localize the excitation volumes of Cherenkov in vivo, allowing precise knowledge of
where the detected light came from. Time-resolved emission can be captured with time-gated intensified sensors
for luminescence lifetime data, that we are advancing. We also advance probes for lifetime sensing of oxygen
partial pressure (pO2) and tissue acidity (pH). CELMS achieves similar benefits to light-sheet fluorescence
microscopy but can image through the whole body of a rat. While the diffuse optical luminescence still has to
exit the body, reconstruction-based recovery can improve the localization through iterative image reconstruction,
achieved with full knowledge of where the excitation beam was within the body. Most importantly, high energy
x-rays are less absorbed than lower kVp x-rays, and so this can be achieved with a radiation dose as low as a
CT scan. The design can implicitly allow longitudinal temporal sampling or spatial heterogeneity histogram
sampling. Advanced non-toxic biocompatible probes have been uniquely developed for this application, that do
not require toxicity associated with heavy metals or nanoparticles. To advance the technology for translation to
other medical centers, we identify low-cost approaches that can work with any Linac, through innovations in
hardware, open-source software, and suitable metabolic probes. In the hardware advancement we invent a new
sensor approach to maximize capture of every possible photon per Linac pulse, thereby minimizing dose
required. The techniques can be distributed with a Linac treatment plan that is completed with a delivered dose
less than a diagnostic CT scan, <10 mGy. In the probes, a new version of bright-emitting, biocompatible,
implanted oxygen sensors will be advanced with high potential for daily measurement in the same locations.
Taken together this project will provide the tool for a fundamentally new low-cost way to image metabolic
signatures of tissue that could be widely available in any academic medical center, with superior image
resolution, deeper tissue penetration, and better linearity of response than is possible today."
10801935,"ABSTRACT:
Balance of excitation and inhibition is critical for proper function of the nervous system. In many brain regions,
there is feedforward and feedback inhibition from interneurons that release the inhibitory transmitter GABA to
balance the release of excitatory glutamate from long-range inputs. However, in the lateral habenula (LHb) - a
key component of the brain's reward system – there is little, if any, feedforward or feedback inhibition and few
inhibitory neurons. Instead, our work suggests that excitatory/inhibitory balance is achieved, at least partly, by
co-release of GABA with glutamate from individual inputs arising from the globus pallidus (GPi), a major input to
the LHb. The activity of GPi inputs to the LHb and the activity of LHb neurons affect motivational vigor. They are
also phasically excited by negative environmental feedback and phasically inhibited by positive environmental
feedback, which guide learning. Rats with low motivation and negatively biased feedback sensitivity have
elevated LHb activity and unbalanced GABA and glutamate signaling from the GPi to LHb. Based on these
observations, we believe that GABA/glutamate balance from GPi to the LHb is important for (1) regulating tonic
(basal) LHb activity and motivational vigor, and (2) bidirectional phasic signaling of negative and positive
feedback in the LHb and behavioral sensitivity to negative and positive feedback. The objective of this grant is
to test these hypotheses by artificially manipulating GABA/glutamate balance from GPi to LHb in mice and
measuring (1) tonic LHb activity and motivation, and (2) phasic LHb responses and behavioral sensitivity to
negative feedback (reward omission) and positive feedback (reward). Based on studies of GABA/glutamate co-
release in the hippocampus, we further hypothesize that long-term changes in tonic and/or phasic LHb activity
will induce homeostatic plasticity of GABA/glutamate co-transmission from the GPi to LHb. We believe this study
is significant because it will reveal the relationship between excitatory/inhibitory balance and fundamental
motivational and learning processes that are affected in many psychiatric disorders, while also investigating the
function of GABA/glutamate co-transmission."
10802019,"PROJECT SUMMARY
B cells are critical for immune responses to infection and in many forms of autoimmune disease. They develop
in the bone marrow and migrate to lymph nodes and spleen, where they further mature. At the end of this process,
B cells express a high affinity B cell receptor with which they recognize antigen and which allows them to develop
further into either memory B cells or long-lived plasma cells. Both types of cells migrate to the bone marrow and
provide long-term protection from reinfection with the same pathogen. Plasma cells are a B cell type that
produces large quantities of antibodies that are critical for neutralizing pathogens such as influenza virus, or
more recently, SARS-CoV2. Several forms of primary immunodeficiency are caused by defects in B cell
development or maturation including agammaglobulinemia and common variable immunodeficiency (CVID),
which are characterized by a complete or partial lack of antibody production. Underlying these forms of
immunodeficiency are mutations in a plethora of genes that encode transcription factors, cell surface receptors
and signal transduction molecules. Some of these mutations occur in genes encoding ion channels. Ion channels
are located in the cell membrane or membranes of intracellular organelles. They function as gateways to mediate
the transport of charged ions such as calcium, zinc or chloride. Inherited mutations in two ion channels were
shown to prevent the development of B cells resulting in agammaglobulinemia. Studies in mice have identified
additional ion channels that are required for B cell function. Overall however, the role of ion channels in B cells
is poorly understood with only a handful of the more than 600 known ion channel genes implicated in B cell
function to date. This is even more extreme for plasma cells because no ion channel has yet been reported that
specifically regulates plasma cell development or function. This lack of information is in strong contrast to the
well established role of ion channels in cells of the brain, nerves, heart, muscle or kidney. It also represents a
missed opportunity from a basic science perspective and our ability to understand how immune responses to
infection are regulated, and from a therapeutic perspective because ion channels are excellent drug targets.
Drugs modulating ion channel function are a mainstay in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, neurological
and psychiatric disorders and type 2 diabetes. We have therefore conducted genetic screens to identify novel
ion channels that regulate the development of B cells into plasma cells and identified around 10 such channels.
We investigated several of these further and confirmed that inhibiting their expression in B cells interferes with
plasma cell development. In this proposal, we will focus on two of these channels and determine the molecular
and cellular mechanisms by which they control the development of B cells into plasma cells and their ability to
mount an antibody response to infection with viral pathogens such as influenza."
10802031,"Plasma HDL levels are inversely associated with coronary, cerebral and peripheral arterial disease
(PAD), and also type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, how HDL influences these conditions remains poorly
understood. We previously showed that HDL attenuates vascular inflammation and promotes neovascularization
via scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) and its adaptor protein PDZK1 in endothelial cells (EC). We recently
identified Breakpoint Cluster Region (BCR) protein as a novel PDZK1 interacting protein in human EC. In other
contexts BCR has known functions modulating Rac1 and RhoA, and we discovered it to be a novel kinase for
Akt kinase activated by HDL in EC. Our studies in BCR null mice then revealed for the first time that BCR is
required for HDL-related atheroprotection, HDL-induced endothelial repair and angiogenesis, and normal
glucose homeostasis. The Overall Goal of the present project is to determine HOW BCR actions in EC contribute
to HDL-related atheroprotection and promotion of neovascularization and normal glucose homeostasis. Three
Aims are proposed in cultured EC and mice. Aim 1 will determine how endothelial BCR impacts atherosclerosis.
We recently discovered in culture that BCR is necessary for HDL attenuation of both the monocyte-EC adhesion
and the Rac1-dependent EC LDL transport that converge to drive atherogenesis. Using cultured EC, floxed BCR
mice, and nanoparticle-based EC cDNA delivery to reconstitute EC wild-type or mutant BCR expression in vivo,
we will test the hypothesis that HDL-related atheroprotection is mediated by EC BCR and its capacity to function
as a kinase or inhibitor of Rac1. In cultured EC we will also query how HDL subspecies with varying Apo-A1 and
Apo-A2 content and size impact BCR-dependent atheroprotective processes. Aim 2 will determine how EC BCR
impacts neovascularization, which is critical to PAD pathogenesis and resolution. We recently showed that EC
migration prompted by HDL is BCR-dependent. Using cultured EC, floxed BCR mice, reconstitution of EC BCR
in vivo, and mouse models of EC repair, angiogenesis and hindlimb ischemia, we will test the hypothesis that
EC BCR function as a kinase or an activator of RhoA underlies HDL-induced neovascularization. In culture, how
HDL subspecies impact EC neovascularization mechanisms will also be examined. Aim 3 will determine how
EC BCR impacts glucose control. Knowing that HDL has antidiabetic action and that EC insulin transport to
skeletal muscle drives processes underlying 80-90% of total body glucose disposal, we have discovered that
HDL stimulates EC insulin transport via BCR. Using cultured EC, floxed BCR mice, reconstitution of EC BCR
and glucose control phenotyping in vivo, we will test the hypothesis that EC BCR function as an Akt kinase
kinase underlies HDL promotion of normal glucose homeostasis. In culture, how HDL subspecies impact EC
insulin transport will also be studied. The proposed work providing new insights into how HDL affords
cardiometabolic protection has the potential to add clarity to why HDL has varying impact on individuals, and to
reveal new therapeutic targets to leverage against cardiovascular and metabolic disease."

The goal of this project is to determine the molecular mechanisms by which pre-mRNA splicing is regulated by
protein arginine methylation, one of the most abundant post-translational modifications on the RNA binding
proteins, and to define the impact of this regulation in synapse development and brain function. The human
genome encodes nine protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMT1–9), which catalyze three types of arginine
methylation: monomethylation (MMA), asymmetric dimethylation (ADMA), and symmetric dimethylation (SDMA).
A few years ago, we characterized the newest member of the PRMT family–PRMT9 and identified the splicing
factor SF3B2 as the primary substrate of PRMT9, linking its function to pre-mRNA splicing. However, the
biological function of PRMT9 and the molecular mechanism by which PRMT9-catalyzed SF3B2 arginine
methylation regulates pre-mRNA splicing are still unknown. Recently, mutation of PRMT9 was identified in
autosomal recessive intellectual disability (ID) from a large whole genome sequencing study of 136
consanguineous families, underscoring the significance of understanding the biological function and regulation
of this newest PRMT. In our preliminary studies, we determined that the ID-associated PRMT9 mutation
abolishes its arginine methyltransferase activity on SF3B2, and the mutant protein is unstable and subject to
heavy ubiquitination. By establishing a novel Prmt9 conditional knockout mouse model, we revealed that PRMT9
loss causes abnormal synapse development and impairs mouse learning and memory. Mechanistically, we
discovered a critical protein-RNA interaction between the arginine 508 (R508) of SF3B2, the site that is
exclusively methylated by PRMT9, and the pre-mRNA anchoring site, a cis-regulatory element located upstream
of the branch point sequence (BPS). Additionally, we uncovered two molecular pathways that regulate PRMT9
expression at the mRNA and protein levels. Built upon these exciting discoveries, our central hypothesis is that
PRMT9-mediated arginine methylation regulates SF3B2–anchoring site interaction and U2 snRNP recruitment,
a process that is critical for pre-mRNA splicing and brain development. This hypothesis will be tested in three
specific aims: 1) determine how PRMT9-mediated SF3B2 arginine methylation regulates pre-mRNA splicing; 2)
define the molecular pathways that regulate PRMT9 expression; and 3) investigate how PRMT9 loss-of-function
impacts synapse development and circuit connectivity. Successful completion of these proposed studies will
reveal a novel and fundamental molecular network underlying the regulation of RNA splicing in brain
development. The key pathways revealed in this study could be harnessed as targets for treating
neurodevelopmental disorders."

Early prediction of dementia can provide a unique opportunity for interventions to prevent or delay the onset of
dementia. There is evidence that alterations in many physiological functions precede the clinical onset of
Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia. The hypothesis behind this proposal is that brain activities assessed
by electroencephalogram (EEG) signals can offer prognostic value for persons at risk for dementia. The goal of
this project is to develop EEG biomarkers (EDBs) to predict future risk of dementia and monitor the
progress of cognitive decline. To achieve the goal, the PI and his team propose to investigate/assess the
complex EEG fluctuations using both traditional and novel methods derived from nonlinear dynamics theory.
Deep learning (DL) — the recent advance in the field of artificial intelligence — will be used to extract EEG
features from multiple EEG measures and develop EDBs for the risk for dementia. Using the existing datasets
of four cohorts in the National Sleep Research Resource (NSRR) that together provide >8,000 older adults with
assessments of overnight EEG, cognitive status and genetic data, four aims will be addressed. In Aim 1, deep
convolutional neuron network models will be built to construct EDBs using EEG measures at different wake/sleep
stages together (Aim 1A) or separately (Aim 1B). The effects of sex and ethnicity on EDBs and their performance
in predicting dementia will also be examined (Aim 1C). In Aim 2, the longitudinal changes in EDBs and their
associations with longitudinal change in cognition will be determined. In Aim 3, genetic factors related to the risk
for Alzheimer’s disease (Aim 3A, 3B) and sleep/circadian (Aim 3C) will be combined with derived EDBs to
improve the prediction of incident dementia. In Exploratory Aim 4, the links of EDBs to non-cognitive functional
outcomes such as sleep/circadian disturbances and risk for disability will be explored. Aim 1 will be completed
in the mentored phase and Aims 2-4 will be completed in the independent phase of this award. This research
project may provide a cost-efficient, non-invasive tool for the early prediction and monitoring of dementia as well
as for the evaluation of treatments of the disease. The project will be performed at Brigham & Women’s Hospital
and Harvard Medical School. The PI is well suited to accomplish this interdisciplinary research project with his
established expertise in biomedical engineering, data science, and biostatistics as well as the strong
mentoring/advisory team that will help the PI to receive advanced training in deep learning, human clinical
studies, and sleep/circadian physiology, gain new expertise in dementia and aging research, and learn about
genetic analysis. Fulfilling the proposed research and training activities will prepare the PI for launching his own
independent research program in the interdisciplinary field of data science and remote medicine."

Heat waves are a growing public concern and a leading cause of climate-related morbidity and mortality in the
US. Eight out of 10 U.S. population live in urban areas. The combination of rising temperatures and urbanization
poses a significant risk for vulnerable urban populations due to the slow release of heat by urban heat islands
created by extreme summer temperatures. While adaptation planning for heat waves during the day has been
developed and implemented at the city-wide and governmental levels, heat adaptation behaviors in individual
households are less understood, particularly during nighttime hours. Although prior studies have identified
several individual factors associated with heat adaptation, the role of nighttime indoor heat exposure as an
external hazard has not been examined. Moreover, the contribution of the built environment on heat exposure
and individual adaptation behavior has not been fully evaluated although the build environment play a role in
residential household. To fill these gaps, we will examine the combined effects of individual factors, built
environment, and nighttime indoor heat exposure on heat adaptation behavior using the Protective Action
Decision Model. The long-term goal of this study is to reduce heat exposure risks and increase resilience to
climate change for vulnerable urban populations. Our aims are to establish a community advisory board and
examine the effects of indoor home heat exposure, individual attribute, and built environmental factors on heat
adaptation behavior. The study results will be disseminated to community leaders and residents. We expect that
disseminating our findings regarding the drivers and barriers of heat adaptation behavior helps individuals living
in underserved urban communities take the necessary steps to reduce their potential health risks associated
with nighttime heat exposure. We believe that the results of this study can provide an affordable and practical
adaptation strategies for those affected by heat exposure during nighttime. This proposed exploratory study is
directly responsive to the National Institute of Environmental Health Science Strategic Goal 2: Promoting
Translation- Data to Knowledge to Action: Emerging Environmental Health Issues (Climate Impacts on Health
and Preparation for Future Threats) and has the potential to reduce heat exposure risks and increase resilience
to climate change for vulnerable urban populations."

Over 90% of Asian American (AsA) adults are either first-generation (foreign-born) or second-generation
immigrants, experiencing a substantial environmental and sociocultural transition in this country. Yet, most
environmental epidemiology cohorts have rarely included sufficient numbers of AsA. The FAMiLI (Food and
Microbiome Longitudinal Investigation), is the only large environmental epidemiology cohort, incorporating a
broad spectrum of AsA. We uniquely capture environmental, diet acculturation, and sociocultural factors—pre
and post-immigration at baseline, and with repeated assessments during follow-up. A biobank, including buccal
and stool samples, will greatly advance biological discoveries in the oral and gut microbiomes, metabolomics,
human genomics, and other omics markers. Lastly, the FAMiLI represents an exceptional opportunity to
compare risk associations in Chinese and Korean Americans, with those in their native countries, through well-
established Chinese and Korean cohort studies in the Asia Cohort Consortium, providing valuable insight into
Asian ancestry, migration, and health outcomes.
The overarching rationale for FAMiLi is to examine from an “exposome” perspective, the biological, lifestyle,
behavioral, environmental, and sociocultural factors that impact the AsA health disparities, with the ultimate goal
of improving AsA health. Initiated in 2018, we completed an initial recruitment and biospecimen collection of
12,000 study participants (aged 35–75 years), including 5,000 AsA. Through this U24, we propose to maintain
FAMiLI data and biospecimens and enrich the cohort through additional recruitment, data collection,
biorepository, data management collaboration, and enhancing workforce diversity.
The FAMiLI was a unique nationwide resource with extensive data and biospecimen collection to answer
important scientific questions advancing environmental health science relevant to NIEHS strategic plan, including
the microbiome, the exposome, individual superstability, and data science/big data. These questions include
critical windows of environmental changes through the immigration experience in the new country, racial
disparities, and the factors underlying the increase in health outcomes. The FAMiLI with integrated community
participation will be a foundation to translate knowledge into action regarding disparities in AsA, the often
marginalized and underserved population, and further foster collaborations and bring workforce diversity for
underserved populations."

Mice and human physiology are deeply affected by brown fat through its control of metabolic homeostasis and
production of signaling molecules. As such, brown fat specific genetic modifications in mice have arisen as a
truly relevant tool to understand brown fat role in controlling physiology with applications in an array of organ
systems. For this, Cre-recombinase drivers under control of the UCP1 promoter have been used. In this proposal,
we show that the most commonly used mouse model of brown fat targeting is the source of some previously
unnoticed negative effects. Thus, our preliminary data supports an unmet critical need to generate a new mouse
model to target mature brown adipocytes in an efficient and safe manner. For these reasons, the main goals of
this application are to generate (Aim 1), validate (Aim 2) and make widely available (Aim 3) a new model of
brown fat targeting. For this, we will use an innovative but validated CRISPR/Cas9 targeting technique to insert
Cre-recombinase driven by a defined ucp1 promoter into a safe harbor location. Next, we will use Cre-mediated
lineage tracing techniques to address its cellular specificity. Due to the broad interest in brown fat biology, this
mouse model is anticipated to be broadly used by scientists in an array of fields of interest to multiple NIH
institutes. This new mouse model of brown fat targeting is expected to have a positive impact as a step forward
towards developing better preclinical mouse models. We will make our new model available to the community
through a mouse repository. For these reasons, this proposal is directed to the FOA PAR-21-167, “Development
of Animal Models and Related Materials for Research”."
10809162,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In the United States, colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality is markedly higher in African-American (AA) patients than
any other racial or ethnic group. Treatment options, socioeconomic status (SES), comorbidities, and tumor
characteristics contribute to survival disparities. Tumor characteristics focused on metabolism and microbiology
have been rarely studied in relation to CRC mortality and racial/ethnic group, and thus requires further
investigation. Metabolites are substrates and products of metabolism required by tumor cells for gene regulation,
growth, and immune responses. They can modulate the metabolism and efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs,
therefore are linked to CRC treatment response and mortality rates. Differences in lifestyle factors (i.e., diet,
physical activity), social determinants of health, and environmental exposures exist between racial/ethnic groups
and affect metabolite production in CRC. In addition, the colon microbiome is a major modulator of metabolites
and has been implicated in CRC. Given that metabolites are susceptible to modulation by lifestyle factors that
differ between racial/ethnic groups, and tumor characteristics contribute to disparities in CRC mortality, we
hypothesize that differences in CRC metabolites and microbiome between racial/ethnic groups account
for disparities in clinical outcomes. Our objective is to address the lack of knowledge in this area by
performing a discovery metabolomics approach to identify salient features of CRC metabolism inherent to race.
We will also examine how the microbiome and metabolome change during the continuum of CRC care, associate
with treatment responses, and are affected by SES. In specific aim 1, we will use untargeted metabolomics,
metabolic pathway analysis, and molecular networking approaches to identify CRC tumor tissue metabolites
specific to AAs, with stratification by sex, stage, and SES. This will generate the first ever metabolic signatures
of CRC in AAs and will include exogenous metabolites derived from environmental exposures and the
microbiome. For specific aim 2, we will identify the impact of surgery and chemotherapeutic treatments on the
CRC stool microbiome. We will identify microbiota unique to AA patients and determine if factors related to SES
including diet, physical activity, and body mass index may confound this association. We will ultimately determine
how the response to treatment differs between AA and non-Hispanic white patients to better understand
mechanisms of increased mortality in AAs with CRC. The immediate outcomes of this proposal are: 1) generation
of the first metabolic signature of CRC by race, 2) identification of novel microbial and environmental metabolites
of CRC by race, 3) the first characterization of microbiome and metabolite changes at crucial time points along
the continuum of CRC care (e.g., diagnosis, surgery, chemotherapy) and associations to SES. This data will
generate new hypotheses regarding tumor characteristics and cancer outcomes. Our long-term goal is to
improve patient outcomes by identifying key metabolic pathways and microbiota that differ between
race/ethnicity, SES and may be exploited for the development of more effective therapeutic interventions."
10810538,"There is strong evidence that cancer treatment contributes to increased comorbidity, functional
decline, and accelerated biologic aging. Resistance training (RT) interventions may help to
minimize this functional decline by increasing lean mass. Patients diagnosed with colon cancer
are particularly likely to benefit from RT interventions given the high prevalence of involuntary loss
of skeletal muscle mass (sarcopenia) at diagnosis, which is associated with chemotherapy-
associated toxicities, and poor prognosis. Epigenetic clocks, which predict chronologic or
phenotypic age based on specific patterns of DNA methylation (DNAm), are easy to assay, well-
validated markers of biologic aging. Those with higher epigenetic age acceleration (AgeAccel;
DNAm-estimated age adjusting for chronologic age) are at an elevated risk for morbidity (early
onset of functional impairment, frailty and other aging syndromes) and mortality, independent of
other predictors of longevity. We hypothesize that colon cancer patients with higher blood
AgeAccel will be at greater risk for chemotherapy toxicities, dose reductions, and delays, that
AgeAccel will increase during colon cancer chemotherapy, and that a RT intervention can reduce
the rate of epigenetic aging. We further hypothesize that AgeAccel measured in blood and tumor
tissue will be related to colorectal cancer molecular subtypes and patient prognosis. We plan to
investigate these hypotheses in collaboration with the Resistance Training to Reduce
Chemotoxicity in Colon Cancer (FORCE) clinical trial. This clinical trial of RT in stage II and III
colon cancer patients includes detailed treatment and participant information, tumor specimens,
longitudinal collection of blood and multimodal measures of body composition. Our aims will
investigate whether several measures of blood AgeAccel at baseline relate to the incidence of
moderate/severe chemotoxicities, and relative dose intensity. We will assess the rate of blood
epigenetic aging over chemotherapy, and whether this rate is modified by RT. We will evaluate
whether AgeAccel estimated in blood and tumor tissue differs by colorectal cancer molecular
subtypes and associations with overall survival, recurrence, comorbidity accumulation, and
trajectories of muscle mass. Together, these analyses will provide novel insight into the biologic
processes of aging that predict tolerance for cancer treatment and patient prognosis to inform
appraisal of whether AgeAccel may serve as a useful tool to guide clinical care."
10810540,"Project Summary
Approximately 30% of older adults in the United States have diabetes mellitus (DM). Alzheimer’s disease and
Alzheimer's disease-related dementias (AD/ADRD) are highly prevalent in this population and cognitive
impairment is a major predictor for functional decline and disability in DM. Current guidelines recommend
screening for cognitive impairment in older adults with DM and providing guidance for DM management.
Nonetheless, no disease-modifying treatment is available and more importantly the exact mechanism underlying
the link between DM and AD/ADRD is unclear. Long term hyperglycemia is known to cause brain insulin
resistance and impaired neuronal insulin signaling (NIS). Impaired NIS results in neuronal cell death,
neuroinflammation, amyloid β deposition and tau phosphorylation; central components of AD/ADRD
pathophysiology. Given the crucial roles of NIS in brain structural integrity and cognitive function, abnormal NIS
is a highly plausible, yet understudied, mechanism underlying the high risk of cognitive impairment in DM. The
overarching hypothesis of this project is that abnormal NIS precedes accelerated brain structural and cognitive
changes in patients with DM and modification of NIS can potentially serve as a key strategy to prevent cognitive
decline in this population. NIS mediators are highly expressed in plasma enriched extracellular vesicles
(exosomes) and in this study we will use this phenomenon to assess the state of NIS in each individual. We plan
to leverage the existing data from the ACCORD-MIND study (a landmark multi-ethnic study that investigated the
effect of glycemic control on brain structures and cognitive function in DM). We will sample 200 male and female
patients with DM with various levels of glycemic control from the ACCORD-MIND study with extensive
longitudinal cognitive, clinical, and neuro-imaging data (7 years of follow up). The NIS exosomes will be isolated
and quantified from available fasting blood samples to investigate whether impaired NIS precedes brain volume
loss and cognitive decline. We will take a stepwise analytical approach to investigate the association of NIS with
the trajectories of changes in brain structure and cognitive function in our study population. We will address the
dose-response impact of glycemic control, measured by changes in hemoglobin A1c (A1C), on NIS and explore
the role of NIS on the association of glycemic control measures with cognitive decline and brain volume loss.
Identification and characterization of NIS biomarkers related to preclinical AD/ADRD phenotypes, such as brain
volume loss or cognitive decline, will offer opportunities for early interventions to slow down the pace of cognitive
decline in DM. Findings of this study can inform future studies on targeted systemic glycemic control dependent
on the state of NIS in order to promote brain health in patients with DM."

The International Consortium on Brain and Behavior Copy Number Variants (IBBC-CNVs) is a collaborative
effort of 9 institutions with complementary experience and expertise in phenomics and genomics. The 22q11.2
and 16p11.2 loci are associated with significant risk for neuropsychiatric disorders across the lifespan. The
clinical presentations are heterogeneous, manifesting in a range of developmental neuropsychiatric disorders,
including Attention Deficit Hyperactivity, Anxiety, Autism Spectrum, and Psychosis Spectrum Disorders. Taking
a ‘genetics first’ approach of ascertaining patients based on known, homogeneous genetic etiologies will allow
us to overcome barriers posed by the genetic and phenotypic complexity of idiopathic developmental
neuropsychiatric disorders. We postulate that CNVs exert a large main effect on psychopathology, but the
nature and degree of psychopathology observed in CNV carriers is multifactorial, with contributions from
additional rare and common genetic variants, as well as environmental factors. Therefore, dissecting the
effects of major CNV hits as well as additional rare and common variants on dimensional measures of
psychopathology can elucidate the combined contribution of genetic mechanisms to psychiatric conditions and
build models of risk prediction. Notably, the presentation and course of psychopathology in the CNVs resemble
these features in idiopathic disorders. Therefore, beyond the specific genetic syndromes investigated, such a
cross-CNV effort will identify convergent risk mechanisms for developmental neuropsychiatric disorders that
are of relevance to the broader population.
 We propose to dissect dimensional measures of psychosis, social-emotional processing and neurocognition,
and their genetic and environmental modifiers, to elucidate the architecture of risk for neuropsychiatric
disorders in CNV carriers. Prospective evaluation with dimensional measures relevant to neuropsychiatric
disorders will be applied to a cohort of 2000 individuals with 22q11.2 and 16p11.2 deletions and duplications
(500 per group) and their relatives as feasible. In addition, categorical psychiatric diagnoses will be assessed
in CNV carriers. Recruitment for prospective phenotyping will leverage existing large cohorts that carry these
reciprocal CNVs, many of whom have already been ascertained and characterized with a range of phenotypic
measures. New whole genome sequencing (WGS) will be performed in CNV carriers that have not yet been
sequenced. We will also utilize existing genetic data from the largest available case-control samples
diagnosed with SZ, ASD, and ADHD in the PGC to generate polygenic risk scores. Finally, we will examine
family and environmental factors that contribute to the heterogeneity of presentation and developmental course
in CNV carriers. This project will establish common phenomic and genomic resources. Our ability to conceive
such a large-scale study capitalizes on our existing successful collaborations, complementary expertise, and
institutional commitments to achieve these goals."

The long term goals of our research are to study the role of post-translational protein modifications and their
role in phototransduction protein synthesis and maturation. The purpose of this proposal is to investigate the
importance of the isoprenylation of phosphodiesterase-6 (PDE6) in retinal photoreceptor neurons. PDE6 is
an enzyme that is essential for vision, and its absence or mutations in humans lead to retinitis pigmentosa
(RP) and color blindness. Interestingly, changes in Aryl hydrocarbon receptor protein-like-1 (AIPL1), a co-
chaperone for PDE6 leads to more severe childhood blindness. Despite the clear link to several blinding
diseases, our knowledge on assembly and maturation of this essential enzyme in photoreceptor neurons is
not known. Our study will specifically focus on the interplay between AIPL1, HSP90, and lipid modification in
PDE6 assembly, maturation, and trafficking to the photoreceptor outer segments. We will also study the
importance of differential isoprenylation in mediating light-dependent signaling in the photoreceptor cells.
We will use a combination of unique animal models, in vivo electrophysiological measurements, ex vivo
retinal culture models and in vitro biochemical analyses to comprehensively address this question.
Our proposed studies are aligned with the Retinal Diseases Program of the NEI to “Identify the genes
involved in both inherited and retinal degenerative diseases (including RP), determine the
pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these mutations, and determine new potential therapeutic
strategies for treatment such as gene transfer, tissue and cell transplantation, growth factor therapy, and
pharmacological intervention.” Our proposed studies have clinical implications, such as therapy for
mutations in PDE6 and AIPL1 that lead to blindness in humans."

Heart failure is a major health problem and its underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly defined,
hampering and delaying the development of effective and targeted therapies for clinical patient management.
During the pathogenesis of many heart diseases, fetal genes and developmental signals are re-activated. The
canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway is one of the most diverse signaling networks and has been implicated in
many human diseases as well as almost every aspect of development. Our data have revealed that canonical
Wnt/β-catenin signaling plays a key role in human and animal models of heart failure. However, it is not clear
how β-catenin signaling is transmitted to the transcriptional machinery for fetal gene reprograming. Our data
has revealed that TCF7L2 isoforms are the major and essential nuclear organizers that assemble the β-
catenin-mediated transcriptional complex. We have identified major cardiac-specific TCF7L2 isoforms
expressed in different stages of heart development and hypothesize that differential expression of TCF7L2
isoforms dictates the context-specific gene targets of cardiac Wnt signaling. More importantly, fetal TCF7L2
isoforms are active in failing human hearts. In this proposal, we will profile cardiac-specific TCF7L2 isoforms
and their target genes in human hearts. Moreover, we will create mouse models to determine whether TCF7L2
is necessary for heart failure development after pressure overload or sufficient to induce heart failure when
overexpressed according to Koch’s postulates for identifying the causative agents of a disease. Finally, we will
evaluate if pharmacologic intervention to interfere TCF7L2 interaction with β-catenin can prevent heart failure
after pressure overload or TCF7L2 overexpression. Our goal is to determine if manipulating β-catenin signal
transduction by targeting unique function domains of cardiac-specific TCF7L2 isoforms can efficiently prevent
or even reverse cardiac remodeling and heart failure."
10815366,"The overall objective of the Qualification Section is to qualify our liver acinus MPS (LAMPS) as a drug
development tool (DDT) for the following two contexts of use (CoUs): a) to predict candidate hepatic clearance
and 2) to identify toxicity of drug candidates in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to aid in
the assessment of first-in-human (FIH) dosing for NAFLD clinical trials and provide supporting data showing
acceptable toxicity in the human diseased liver for inclusion of the drug candidate NAFLD clinical trials. We will
also qualify our vascularized LAMPS (vLAMPS) as a DDT for two CoUs: a) to predict efficacy of drug candidates
for resolving NAFLD providing data to support advancement to clinical trials and assist in determining first-in-
human dosing, and b) to predict the responsiveness of individual patients to drug candidates for their inclusion
in clinical trials (clinical trial enrichment). We have outlined the plan for the qualification process, including
working with a consultant experienced with FDA qualification and the FDA during the process. These DDTs
used for these CoUs will address the following FDA regulatory science focus areas: a) Individualized therapies
and precision medicine; b) Complex innovative trial design; c) Technologies to improve predictivity of non-clinical
studies; d) Technologies to reduce reliance on animal testing; and e) Human relevancy of toxicity. In addition,
these DDTs will address the clinical unmet needs for NAFLD of a) Identifying toxic drugs that should not be given
to NAFLD patients; b) Identifying the most efficacious drugs to give to NAFLD patients; and c) Enrichment of
NAFLD clinical trials. Additionally, the vLAMPS will be integrated with the Nortis Gen2 platform to create an
Automated Biomimetic Analytic MPS (ABAMPS) platform. The ABAMPS platform creates a workflow through
the integration of the BioSystics Analytics Platform (BioSystics-AP™) at the front end for study design, review of
existing data, and recording of study protocols, and at the back end of the Nortis Gen2 automation platform for
data capture, analysis and computational modeling. The Gen2 automation platform employs a new chip material
that replaces the PDMS polymer, and a system that includes semi-automated chip handling, fluidic control, in-
line imaging for temporal and spatial measurements. The ABAMPS platform will create a more efficient and
reproducible platform that utilizes the vLAMPS DDT."

direct high-yield synthesis process for bismuth-gadolinium nanoparticles and perform
extensive toxicity and therapy evaluation in a translational model under clinical delivery

Double (DH) and triple-hit (TH) lymphomas (L) are rare high grade B-cell lymphomas with diffuse large B-cell
(DLBCL) morphology characterized by the co-occurrence of chromosomal translocations involving MYC,
BCL2, and/or BCL6. DLBCLs with dual c-Myc (>40% by immunohistochemistry, IHC) and BCL2 (>50% by IHC)
protein overexpression without translocation (double-expressor or DEL) are significantly more common than
DH/THL, accounting for 20% to 30% of DLBCL patients. Lymphoma with either DEL, DHL, or THL are here
collectively called c-Myc overexpressing LBCL and have a significantly worse prognosis compared to the c-
Myc-negative counterpart [3-year overall survival of ~30% versus 70%, respectively]. The poor clinical
outcome of this subset of lymphoma patients highlights the need for novel therapeutic strategies. Transducin
β-like protein 1 (TBL1X) was initially identified as a specific adaptor protein playing an essential role in
canonical Wnt signaling by recruiting β-catenin to the promoter region of Wnt targets such as MYC and
CCND1 to activate their transcription. Few published reports indicate that the Wnt/β-catenin signaling is
constitutively activated in DLBCL, which prompted our initial investigation in this disease. Preliminary data: Our
published work shows that, unlike normal B cells, DLBCL cells express abundant levels of TBL1. Genetic
deletion of TBL1 or pharmacologic treatment with tegavivint (Iterion), a first-in-class small molecule targeting
TBL1, induces significant DLBCL cell death in vitro and in vivo. While tegavivint was initially developed as an
inhibitor of the TBL1/β-catenin interaction, our data show that genetic deletion of TBL1 and treatment with
tegavivint reduce c-Myc protein expression in a post-transcriptional/β-catenin independent manner. We further
show that in DLBCL, TBL1 interacts with a Skp1/Cul1/F-Box (SCF) supercomplex, which controls the
proteasome-mediated degradation of critical pro-survival proteins such as c-Myc and components of mTOR
signaling such as Rheb. Collectively, these observations establish the rationale for targeting TBL1 as a novel
therapeutic strategy to promote c-Myc turnover and to disrupt the driver events coordinated by its activity in c-
Myc overexpressing LBCL. Project hypothesis: TBL1 serves as a critical modulator of c-Myc turnover and
represents a novel and attractive candidate for targeted therapy for patients with c-Myc overexpressing LBCL.
To test this hypothesis, we propose the following aims: Aim 1: Characterize the TBL1/c-Myc feedforward
circuit promoting c-Myc overexpressing LBCL cell survival. Aim 2: Initiate a Phase Ib trial with single agent
tegavivint in patients with relapsed/refractory cMyc overexpressing LBCL. Aim 3: Identify combination
strategies to maximize the therapeutic potential of tegavivint. At completion of this project, we will have a better
understanding of the TBL1-modulated mechanism through which c-Myc turnover is regulated, will have
developed a novel therapeutic strategy to treat this incurable disease, and will have begun to characterize
resistance mechanisms to tegavivint."

Due to improved treatment and supportive care, five-year survival rates for childhood cancer now exceed 85%.
However, patients treated with anthracycline chemotherapy or chest-directed radiation have a dose-related risk
for adverse cardiovascular sequelae, including cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease and valvular heart
disease, with a negative impact on quality of life and overall survival. Earlier recognition and interventions to
manage cardiac morbidity among childhood cancer survivors (CCS) could provide opportunities to improve
quality of remaining life. To facilitate early detection of cardiomyopathy, the Children's Oncology Group's
guidelines recommend life-long screening of CCS with echocardiography (ECHO) every 2 to 5 years. While
offering an opportunity for early detection of myocardial dysfunction, screening guidelines do not identify
patients with preserved systolic function who may develop cardiomyopathy in the future. Our overarching
long-term goal is to develop a generalizable artificial intelligence (AI)-tool using ECG tracings that can identify
CCS at high risk for future cardiomyopathy. We have shown on a subset of St. Jude Lifetime Cohort (SJLIFE)
study data that CCS at high risk for cardiomyopathy withing 10 years can be predicted with high accuracy
(AUC of 0.87) via artificial intelligence (AI) using raw digital electrocardiography (ECG) data only. Our goal in
this project is to develop a robust (Aim 1), generalizable (Aim 2), and remotely applicable (Aim 3) AI-tool that
can identify CCS at cardiomyopathy risk from low-cost and highly-accessible ECG data. We will achieve our
goal by following three specific aims:
Aim 1. Develop an AI tool to predict risk of future cardiomyopathy among CCS: We will utilize data from
3,731 SJLIFE participants to refine and internally validate a novel AI-tool predicting CCS at high risk for
cardiomyopathy (defined as ejection fraction < 50% or >10% drop), in the subsequent 3, 5, and 10 years. We
will use signal processing and deep learning to generate features representing ECGs and use these features in
machine learning to predict cardiomyopathy.
Aim 2. Perform an external validation of the AI tool on a subgroup of the Amsterdam LATER Cohort.
We will externally validate our AI-tool on 343 CCS treated for childhood cancer at the Emma Children's
Hospital/Academic Medical Center in Netherland. We will assess the concordance of the AI-tool performance
on the LATER cohort vs hold out test cohort at SJLIFE.
Aim 3. Evaluate the feasibility of remote cardiomyopathy prediction via smartwatch. We will collect
ECGs on a subset of SJLIFE participants via a smartwatch during their routine exam and assess the.
concordance of risk predictions by AI-tool using smartwatch ECG vs clinical ECG.
Impact: Our results offer the potential to positively impact CCS health by 1) identifying those who may benefit
from more frequent or advanced cardiac imaging, and 2) guiding future studies in remote and real time
prediction of late-onset cardiomyopathy.

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that results in amyloid β plaque deposition,
neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) formation, and life-altering cognitive defects. Many human genetic AD risk factors,
including APOE, CLU, and TREM2, modulate neuroinflammation and/or the function of microglia, the central
nervous system (CNS) resident innate immune cell. Deletion of all peripheral adaptive immune cells (i.e. CD4+
T cells, CD8+ T cells and B cells) or T cell depletion (i.e. CD4+T cells, CD8+T cells) increased cognitive abilities
in amyloidosis and tauopathy models, respectively, and were associated with altered microglial function.
Interestingly, aging, another major AD risk factor, is associated with inflammation and we have found that
increases in CNS CD8+ T cells found with aging is further exacerbated by amyloidosis. Additionally, enhanced
CNS CD8+ T cells numbers are also found during tauopathy. We hypothesize that CD8+ T cells impact
cognition and CNS sequelae during tauopathy and age-associated amyloidosis. We predict that CD8+ T cells
alter microglia function and transcriptomes as a mechanism for disease modulation. To address this
hypothesis, we will utilize aged wild type (WT) control mice, aged APPNL-F/NL-F mice, which express human
amyloid precursor protein (APP) or our AAV1 model of tauopathy, respectively, on a normal WT or CD8-/-
background, to eliminate CD8+ T cells. We will also conduct similar studies on an OT-I background which
contains CD8+ T cells that are not stimulated through their T cell receptor (TCR). We will assess multiple
parameters including behavioral/ cognitive performance (using open field assay, elevated plus maze,
contextual fear conditioning and morris water maze), immunofluorescence/immunohistology examining plaque
deposition, tau phosphorylation, CD8+ T cell localization and microglial/ astrocyte reactivity, flow cytometric
analysis of CNS CD8+ T cell function, western blot analysis for total and phosphorylated tau, ex vivo microglial
cultures and RT-qPCR to examine cortical and hippocampal gene expression of proinflammatory and anti-
inflammatory factors. Furthermore, we will be using single cell transcriptomics to examine the entire RNA
transcriptome on a per cell basis to assess CNS CD8+T cell transcriptomes and the impact of CD8+T cells on
microglial transcriptomes and subpopulations during normal aging, age-associated amyloidosis or tauopathy.
Our proposed work will be the first to define the transcriptomes of CNS CD8+ T cells in the context of age-
associated amyloidosis or tauopathy. Additionally, we will address for the first time how CD8+T cells impact
behavior/cognition, neuroinflammation, gliosis, microglial transcriptomes and pathology during age-associated

interact during aging and disease, and could provide the impetus to examine new therapeutic measures for
management/alleviation of AD associated CNS sequelae."

Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) is the largest long-term study of brain development and child
health in the United States. The ABCD Research Consortium consists of 21 research sites across the country,
a Coordinating Center, and a Data Analysis and Informatics Resource Center. In its first five years, under
RFA-DA-15-015, ABCD enrolled a diverse sample of 11,878 9-10 year olds from across the consortium, and
will track their biological and behavioral development through adolescence into young adulthood.
All participants received a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging,
neuropsychological testing, bioassays, careful assessment of substance use, mental health, physical health,
and culture and environment. A similar detailed assessment recurs every 2 years. Interim in-person annual
interviews and mid-year telephone or mobile app assessments provide refined temporal resolution of
developmental changes and life events that occur over time with minimal burden to participating youth and
parents. Intensive efforts are made to keep the vast majority of participants involved with the study through
adolescence and beyond, and retention rates thus far are very high. Neuroimaging has expanded our
understanding of brain development from childhood into adulthood. Using this and other cutting-edge
technologies, ABCD can determine how different kinds of youth experiences (such as sports, school
involvement, extracurricular activities, videogames, social media, unhealthy sleep patterns, and vaping)
interact with each other and with a child's changing biology to affect brain development and social, behavioral,
academic, health, and other outcomes.
Data, securely and privately shared with the scientific community, will enable investigators to: (1) describe
individual developmental pathways in terms of neural, cognitive, emotional, and academic functioning, and
influencing factors; (2) develop national standards of healthy brain development; (3) investigate the roles and
interaction of genes and the environment on development; (4) examine how physical activity, sleep, screen
time, sports injuries (including traumatic brain injuries), and other experiences influence brain development; (5)
determine and replicate factors that influence mental health from childhood to young adulthood; (6)
characterize relationships between mental health and substance use; and (7) specify how use of substances
such as cannabis, alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine affects developmental outcomes, and how neural, cognitive,
emotional, and environmental factors influence the risk for adolescent substance use."
10816473,"Hereditary Multiple Exostoses (HME) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder that affects thousands of children
worldwide. HME is characterized by cartilaginous-bony tumors called osteochondromas that form within
perichondrium along growth plates and protrude into and collide with surrounding tissues. The tumors can
thus cause skeletal deformities, compression of nerves and blood vessels and chronic pain, and become
malignant in about 2-3% of patients. Current therapies are limited, and patients struggle with pain and limited
mobility and undergo multiple surgeries through life. Most HME patients bear a heterozygous mutation in
EXT1 or EXT2 that are responsible for heparan sulfate (HS) synthesis, thus causing a partial systemic HS
deficiency. The HS chains -and the proteoglycans of which they are part- regulate and distinctly modulate
many processes. Notably, they interact with signaling proteins including bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs)
and hedgehog family members and most often restrict and delimit protein distribution, availability and
activity. However, it is not clear whether and which of these mechanisms may be deranged in HME and how it
could lead to tumor formation. In the previous funding period, we found that conditional ablation of Ext1
caused an increase in pro-chondrogenic BMP signaling in perichondrium and a concurrent decrease in anti-
chondrogenic pERK1/2 and Noggin, deranging normal homeostatic mechanisms that normally maintain the
perichondrium phenotype. In preliminary studies, we have aimed to clarify how the osteochondromas acquire
a growth plate-like organization, are able to grow unidirectionally against surrounding tissues and thus create
damage and havoc. We have obtained evidence for the establishment of an IHH-PTHrP axis driving tumor
outgrowth. Our central hypotheses is that osteochondroma development and outgrowth are driven by: (i) a
steep local deficiency in HS; (ii) increased BMP signaling; and (iii) establishment of a neo IHH-PTHrP loop. As
a result, we posit that osteochondroma development and growth are amenable to drug treatments directed
against components of those regulatory circuits. We will use genetic, biochemical and cellular approaches and
transgenic mouse models that closely mimic human disease progression and burden. The project will continue
to provide fundamentally new insights into cellular and molecular mechanisms of tumor formation as well as
normal functioning of those mechanisms in standard perichondrial and growth plate cells. It will also test
possible therapies based on those insights and thus has major translational medicine value and implications.
The number of HME patients is relatively small, but the community of their families is large. This project will
thus provide a renewed sense of hope to patients and families alike that this disease will continue to be actively
studied and a cure may one day be found."
10816587,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The proposed studies in this K08 application will use innovative approaches to investigate soluble vascular
endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (sVEGFR1) as a critical regulator of pulmonary microvascular remodeling
and inhibitor of pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVM) development. Vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) signaling is integral to sprouting angiogenesis and vascular homeostasis. If left unchecked,
VEGF signaling can also lead to vascular instability and pathologic remodeling. Inhibiting VEGF signaling in
multiple vascular beds can normalize existing AVMs, and supplemental sVEGFR1 can prevent brain AVMs.
Using patient blood samples, we recently identified that sVEGFR1 is significantly elevated in hepatic vein
serum and may be a potential inhibitor of PAVM formation in patients with univentricular congenital heart
disease. The aims of this proposal will directly test our preliminary observation by examining patient blood
samples and testing the effects of sVEGFR1 on the pulmonary microvasculature in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo.
The aims of this proposal are prerequisites to advancing the care of patients with univentricular congenital
heart disease and PAVMs. These aims will also improve our understanding of pulmonary microvascular
biology.
The training plan in this K08 application will support my career development with two main goals. First, I will
further develop expertise manipulating patient-derived and biologically relevant tissues in vitro and ex vivo to
investigate lung endothelial cell gene expression, angiogenesis, and microvascular remodeling. Using
molecular biology tools to modify variables in vitro and probe clinically oriented questions will allow me to
achieve the objectives of this proposal and address new questions in the future as a physician-scientist.
Second, I will acquire new skills and experience working with transgenic animal models and innovative
techniques to study the lung microvasculature. The ability to adeptly use modern transgenic animal models, as
well as leverage clinical skills to modify animal physiology, will position me to independently investigate clinical
problems. Experience with advanced experimental techniques, such as precision cut lung slices, isolated lung
perfusion, and next-generation sequencing (RNA-seq and single cell RNA-seq), will allow me to test
hypotheses with innovative scientific approaches. Finally, as a physician-scientist these skills will position me
well to collaborate with investigators locally and outside my institution to advance team science."

racial disparities in life expectancy. Within VA, higher rates of uncontrolled hypertension or diabetes have been
identified in several racial/ethnic minority groups, compared with white Veterans. The extent to which socio-
economic status (SES)-related differences drive these racial-ethnic disparities is unknown. Patient Aligned
Care Teams (PACT) hold promise as a care delivery model to reduce disparities, however, implementation is
variable, particularly in sites with large proportions of minorities. Though traditional medical models cannot
directly change most social determinants of health like SES, facilities can adapt their delivery approaches to
better meet the needs and healthcare delivery preferences of their patients, e.g., incorporating evidence-based
interventions associated with improved hypertension or diabetes control in vulnerable groups, and in that way
influence outcomes indirectly. Appraisal of multi-level factors (healthcare system, site, patient) associated with
improved outcomes in vulnerable groups (racial/ethnic minorities and the lowest quintile SES), and elucidation
of implementation barriers, may inform VA strategies for tackling low quality and ameliorating high disparities.
Specific Aims:
Aim #1: Characterize associations between vulnerable group and quality (measured by intermediate clinical
outcome quality measures hypertension and diabetes control): (a) Determine variations by race/ethnicity and
SES in hypertension and diabetes care quality; (b) Examine SES as a mediator and moderator of the
relationship between race/ethnicity and quality; and (c) Identify multi-level predictors of quality and disparities.
Aim #2: Identify VA sites representing extremes in vulnerable group quality and disparities – high quality-low
disparity “positive deviant” sites, high disparity sites (high quality for majority groups, low quality for vulnerable
groups), and low performing sites (low quality for both majority and vulnerable groups) – and describe
characteristics of those sites.
Aim #3: Compare positive deviant, high disparity, and low performing sites: (a) Assess clinical practice delivery
arrangements for hypertension and diabetes care, particularly evidence-based approaches associated with
disparities reduction, and contextual factors identified in Aim #1; and (b) Identify barriers to and facilitators of
effective implementation of those delivery arrangements.
Methods: We propose a mixed-methods observational study using primary and secondary data sources to
achieve these aims. For Aims #1 and #2, we will use a national cohort of all Veterans using VA in fiscal year
2017, with their individual socio-demographics, diagnosed conditions, and residential characteristics linked with
existing data on VA site and healthcare system characteristics, including site-level PACT implementation and
healthcare system-level patient experience from VA quality metrics, and then linked to electronic quality
measures. We will determine site-specific performance for vulnerable and majority groups, and disparities
between these groups, then identify sites representing extreme examples of quality and disparities based on
decision rules applied to graphical displays of this data. For Aim #3, we will conduct key stakeholder interviews
at those sites, to explore local practices for achieving hypertension and diabetes control in their patients,
including barriers, facilitators, and contextual factors influencing implementation of evidence-based practices.
Anticipated Impacts on Veterans Health: This research will fill a knowledge gap about the prevalence of VA
disparities related to socio-economic vulnerability, provide evidence on clinical practice delivery arrangements
associated with higher quality and lower disparities for vulnerable groups, and provide effective field-tested
disparities-reduction approaches to inform evidence-based quality improvement initiatives and implementation

10816432,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Glial pathology is increasingly recognized as a key feature in neurodegenerative diseases. However, the exact
mechanisms that promotes glial pathology remain unclear. Several studies implicate the autophagy machinery,
a highly conserved lysosomal degradation pathway, in maintaining protein homeostasis in neurons during brain
aging and neurodegeneration. In addition, autophagy regulates the check-and-balance of microglia-mediated
inflammatory response to misfolded proteins, including β-amyloid peptides, hyperphosphorylated Tau, and TDP-
43, which accumulate during neurodegeneration. Collectively, these results underscore the critical and cell type-
specific role of the autophagy machinery in maintaining neuron-glia homeostasis by regulating the trafficking of
intracellular organelles and cargoes, such as misfolded proteins. In the previous funding period, we uncovered
new autophagy-dependent secretory processes in non-neuronal and glial cells, including most notably, LC3-
dependent extracellular vesicle loading and secretion (LDELS). LDELS targets include RNA binding proteins
and extracellular vesicle (EV) cargoes that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of frontotemporal dementia
(FTD). In addition, our results showed that loss of function in FTD gene Progranulin (Grn) leads to age-dependent
endolysosomal defects and hypersecretory phenotypes in microglia that promotes neuronal loss and abnormal
accumulation of the RNA binding protein TDP-43 in Grn-/- mouse brain. Together, these results underscore the
important roles of autophagy and endolysosomal trafficking in microglial activation in FTD. In follow up studies,
we have further expanded the scope of our work and identified a highly regulated mechanism, Secretory
Autophagy during Lysosome Inhibition (SALI), which is critically dependent on multiple ATGs for autophagosome
formation and on Rab27a for vesicle exocytosis. Using TMT-based quantitative proteomics, we uncovered that
loss of Progranulin leads to a marked increase in unconventional myosin Myo5a, a known Rab27a interacting
partner. Given the well-documented role of Rab27a and Myo5a in the transport of intracellular organelles, these
results broach the hypothesis that blockage of endolysosomal trafficking disrupts microglial homeostasis and
promotes secretory autophagy and neurodegeneration in Grn-/- mice. To test this hypothesis, we will: 1) Delineate
how FTD-associated endolysosomal defects influence secretory autophagy and dissect the effects of SALI on
intracellular homeostasis; 2) Scrutinize how secretory autophagy and endolysosomal defects in microglia impact
lipid metabolism and microglial toxicity; and 3) Determine whether genetic autophagy loss mitigates microglial
toxicity and neurodegeneration in Progranulin-deficient mice. Together, the studies proposed in this renewal
harness the unique expertise in Drs. Huang and Debnath’s laboratories and provide critical insights on how SALI
controls the delicate balance of secretion and intracellular trafficking of disease-relevant proteins in microglia to
promote neurodegeneration in FTD."
10816434,"The overwhelming success of blocking negative checkpoint regulators (NCR; e.g. CTLA-4, PD-1) in cancer has
irrefutably validated NCRs as effective therapeutic targets in unleashing adaptive immunity in humans. We now
present compelling evidence that V-domain Ig suppressor of T cells (VISTA), in addition to its role in regulating
adaptive immunity, is a central negative regulator of innate immunity. Anti-VISTA mabs that trigger through
VISTA disrupt neutrophil and macrophage chemotaxis, alter the myeloid transcriptome and program myeloid
cells to an anti-inflammatory phenotype. Accordingly, anti-VISTA administration profoundly mitigates pathology
in autoimmune disease models mediated by the innate immune system. This proposal will comprehensively
address the impact of checkpoint regulation by VISTA on the genetics, epigenetics, biochemistry and
immunology of myeloid-mediated inflammation. SA#1. VISTA is expressed on neutrophils at very high densities
and we propose that VISTA is a central NCR of neutrophil activities. Data show that anti-VISTA triggering ablates
their chemotactic activities to inflammatory chemokines and arrests neutrophil-mediated inflammation in vivo. A
comprehensive analysis of VISTA negative regulation of neutrophil activation (chemotaxis, rolling, adhesion,
NETs, etc.) will be performed. Unparalleled mechanistic insights into the therapeutic impact of anti-VISTA in the
neutrophil-mediated K/BxN arthritis model will be provided by intravital microscopy in treated mice. SA#2. VISTA
acts as an NCR in monocytes and the mechanisms by which VISTA re-programs their biology will be
characterized. Within the macrophage lineage, we show that VISTA signaling directs macrophages to an anti-
inflammatory program. Defined by either macrophage tolerance or enhanced M1àM2 transition, VISTA elicits
a well-defined transcriptional and functional program that is anti-inflammatory. We propose that triggering
through VISTA can instruct myeloid reprogramming through the induction of a unique, VISTA-specific
transcriptional profile that ablates myeloid chemotaxis, mediator production and inflammation. SA#3. Anti-VISTA
ameliorates lupus by diminishing myeloid migration into the kidney and re-programming the inflammatory profile
of infiltrating myeloid cells. A correlation between the therapeutic impact of anti-VISTA and the treatment-induced
changes in myeloid heterogeneity and gene expression at the single cell level within the kidney will be
established. Furthermore, a comprehensive understanding of how anti-VISTA alters chemokine-dependent
positioning and the histological landscape of myeloid cells in the diseased kidney will be afforded by multiplex
imaging of myeloid subsets in anti-VISTA treated NZB/NZW F1 mice. Together, these two approaches will offer
unique insights into the negative regulation of innate immunity by VISTA in the pathogenesis of autoimmune
kidney disease. In summary, the experiments outlined herein will solidify the emerging role of VISTA as a critical
NCR in innate immunity."

Amines and their derivatives are ubiquitous substances since they are present in the overwhelming majority of
drug molecules, agrochemicals, functional materials as well as many compounds that are produced by living
organisms (i.e., natural products). Notably, there are, on average, 2.8 nitrogen atoms in each of the 200 best-
selling small molecule drugs and, of these drugs, 80% contain at least one N-heterocyclic fragment. It is also
estimated that 45% of drug candidates contain a chiral amine moiety. Among these nitrogen-containing
compounds, aromatic and heteroaromatic amines (i.e., anilines) appear as core structures in more than one third
of drug candidates while aziridines, the three-membered and equally highly-strained nitrogen analogues of
epoxides, are important synthetic intermediates en route to structurally complex molecules due to their versatility
in myriad regio- and stereoselective transformations. Not surprisingly, organic chemists invest a considerable
amount of effort devising better strategies for synthesis of amines that serve as key chemical building blocks for
the preparation of biologically active compounds, especially in medicinal chemistry. These strategies can also
be used for late-stage functionalization of complex molecules that enables the exploration of new chemical space
for biological studies. Consequently, new and powerful synthetic strategies and methods for the rapid and direct
introduction of nitrogen into readily available and inexpensive precursors such as alkanes, alkenes, arenes,
heteroarenes as well as carbonyl compounds are expected to have a far-reaching impact upon how organic
synthesis, medicinal chemistry, biochemistry and chemical biology are practiced. In particular, the introduction
of unprotected nitrogen and other heteroatoms in a single step and under mild conditions will result in processes
that are more efficient and “greener” than currently used multi-step routes and ultimately will lead to the faster
development of new medicines.
During the course of the proposed project novel metal-catalyzed and organocatalytic amination processes will
be developed that will take advantage of both catalytically and stoichiometrically generated electrophilic
aminating agents. Thus, the direct synthesis of chiral as well as achiral primary and secondary anilines from
aromatic and heteroaromatic compounds, of alpha-aminated carbonyl compounds from ketones and carboxylic
acid derivatives, of fully-substituted amines from ketimines, ketoximes and ketiminoesters and of NH- as well as
N-alkylaziridines from isolated/unactivated olefins will be achieved. The proposed catalytic amination processes
will be thoroughly investigated to uncover and understand their mechanistic underpinnings. Emphasis will be
given to the development of reactions that can utilize abundant and inexpensive starting materials and convert
these to structurally complex/value added products under operationally simple and mild reaction conditions."

 Schizophrenia and its clinical risk states are characterized by both positive and negative symptoms.
Positive symptoms in schizophrenia comprise hallucinations and delusions; among teens and young adults at
clinical high-risk (CHR) for psychosis, these are subthreshold in nature (e.g., perceptual disturbances and
unusual thoughts). Negative symptoms in schizophrenia and CHR include anhedonia (the reduced experience
or expectation of pleasure) and avolition (a severe reduction in motivated, goal-directed behavior). Prior work
in schizophrenia suggests that both types of symptoms may result from impairment in salience processing,
which is the appropriate evaluation of the importance and relevance of diverse experiences for normative
learning and decision-making. Adaptive salience is the appropriate response to good or positive experiences;
its blunting has been linked to both anhedonia and avolition. Positive symptoms in schizophrenia have been
associated with aberrant salience, which is the inappropriate assignment of importance to neutral events.
 In this proposal, we will study salience processing and symptoms in CHR individuals, who have evolving
pathophysiology and minimal antipsychotic exposure. We will, for the first time, study both adaptive and
aberrant salience together in a CHR cohort sufficiently large (N = 96) to allow simultaneous examination of
both negative and positive symptoms, who will be followed prospectively for clinical and functional outcome.
We will use fMRI and computational modeling of reinforcement learning and decision-making to capture
quantitative behavioral and neural correlates of: (Aim 1) blunted adaptive salience (and associations with
negative symptoms); and (Aim 2) heightened aberrant salience (and associations with positive symptoms). In
longitudinal study (Aim 3), we will determine the extent to which these two types of salience processing predict
future and/or track change in symptom severity and functional outcome. Exploratory analyses will use all
behavioral, imaging, and clinical data to determine if some salience subconstructs may contribute to both
positive and negative symptoms.
 This proposal is significant for several reasons. There are, as yet, no robustly effective treatments for the
CHR syndrome, which has significant current morbidity related to its positive and negative symptoms (in
addition to cognitive deficits). Also, the CHR syndrome offers an opportune window for preventive intervention
related to worsening symptoms and function and has the added advantage of minimal confounding by illness
chronicity and antipsychotic medication use. Finally, if we find that the neural and behavioral mechanisms
involved in salience processing are associated with negative and positive symptoms, this offers a promising
novel target for treatment of both types of symptoms across the schizophrenia spectrum."

Chromatin context defines all DNA transactions, from gene regulation to genome maintenance. Changes in
chromatin composition are hallmarks of cancer cells that contribute to malignant transformation and have been
studied extensively using a wide range of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) approaches. However,
conventional genome-wide mapping efforts are limited to the detection of individual targets of interest, impeding
the study of their often diverse biological roles. Multi-subunit chromatin-regulatory complexes as well as protein
interactions with histones or noncanonical nucleic acid structures are largely defined through correlative analyses
of separate mapping efforts, which are unable to determine physical interaction, proximity on the same DNA
fragment or even presence in the same cell. These limitations underline an urgent need for improved, context-
dependent chromatin mapping and characterization efforts. In this application, we will establish a versatile and
broadly applicable technique that allows for the genome-scale analysis of two-component interactions on
chromatin. The proposal builds on our extensive experience in the study of genome-wide chromatin responses
to DNA damage, as well as the expertise of co-Investigator Dr. Michael Seidman in the analysis and visualization
of close-proximity molecular interactions in the context of DNA replication stress. Aim 1 will combine this
complementary expertise to develop Proximity-based Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ProxiChIP), a tool to
characterize functional subsets of a given chromatin feature based on its interacting partners, shifting the current
ChIP paradigm towards combinatorial feature mapping. Using well-characterized, interacting chromatin binding
proteins as a proof of principle, we will convert a method currently restricted to the imaging-based detection of
protein interactions (proximity ligation assay, PLA) to a broadly applicable biochemistry tool suitable for
immunoprecipitation and a diverse set of downstream applications including NGS. In Aim 2, we will apply this
methodology to advance the epigenomic characterization of pathological RNA:DNA hybrids, a complex and
poorly understood feature of many cancer genomes thought to contribute to DNA replication stress, cancer
genome instability and therapy response. RNA:DNA hybrids have been mapped genome-wide using DNA:RNA
immunoprecipitation (DRIP) and related methods. However, existing approaches fail to distinguish between
physiological and pathological RNA:DNA hybrid subsets. ProxiChIP-based mapping of RNA:DNA hybrids in the
context of replication stress is expected to define the genomic features that underly pathological R loop formation,
which presents an essential step towards understanding their impact on genome integrity and malignant
transformation."
10816451,"Abstract
Fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23), a bone-derived phosphaturic hormone, plays a key role in the regulation
of serum phosphate levels and vitamin D metabolism. Dysregulated FGF23 actions underlie the pathogenesis
of several skeletal diseases with abnormal mineral ion metabolism. Serum FGF23 levels also rise in kidney
failure, and elevated FGF23 levels contribute greatly to the mineral and bone disorder associated with chronic
kidney disease. Effective strategies for controlling skeletal FGF23 production are needed in order to improve
the clinical management of these disorders. However, mechanisms governing FGF23 production remain poorly
defined, impeding progress toward this goal. Several FGF23 stimulators have been described, but the
molecular determinants of their actions are incompletely understood. The intracellular signaling pathways are
not elucidated, and it remains unknown how those interact with one another. We have now identified
lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) as a novel stimulator of FGF23 synthesis and found that it acts through its G
protein-coupled receptor LPAR1. We also showed that ablation of LPAR1 blocks the rise of FGF23 in a mouse
model of acute kidney injury. Our preliminary experiments also strongly suggested that the action of LPA
involves Gq/11/PKC signaling pathway operating via a mechanism that depends on MAPK-ERK1/2 signaling.
Moreover, our results strongly suggested that the LPA-Gq/11/PKC pathway is critical for FGF23 production
induced by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D). In this proposal, we will investigate this novel paradigm of FGF23
synthesis in osteocytes. Aim 1 will determine the role of osteocyte-specific Gq/11/PKC signaling in LPA-induced
FGF23 production, examine the interaction of this pathway with MAPK-ERK1/2 signaling, and determine
whether it plays a role in the dietary phosphate-induced elevation of FGF23 levels. For those studies, we will
employ mice in which Gq/11α are ablated conditionally in osteocytes (Gq/11αDmp1KO mice, available in our lab), as
well as osteocyte/osteoblast-like cell lines suitable for studying FGF23 synthesis. Aim 2 will elucidate the
cross-talk between the action of 1,25D and LPA-Gq/11/PKC signaling in FGF23 production, using both cell-
based assays and mouse models (Gq/11αDmp1KO and vitamin D receptor knockout mice, also available in our
lab). Aim 3 will examine the role of Gq/11/PKC signaling in pathological conditions of excess FGF23 production,
including X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (XLH) and renal failure. We will employ Hyp mice (an established
model of XLH), which will be crossed with Gq/11αDmp1KO mice. For studying renal failure-induced FGF23
overproduction, we will use a model of chronic kidney disease induced by adenine-rich diet. Our studies will
elucidate the role of the LPA-Gq/11/PKC pathway as a stimulator of FGF23 production in osteocytes and identify
its relationship with the cellular actions of other important systemic regulators of FGF23 synthesis. Our
predicted results will thus markedly increase the knowledge of the mechanisms controlling FGF23 synthesis
and are likely to yield new drug targets for diseases caused or affected by dysregulated FGF23 actions."

In Medicine, Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (MSTEM), there is a shortage of
underrepresented students (i.e., ethnic minorities, women, LGBTQ+, individuals with disabilities, first-
generation students, and those from low-income or otherwise disadvantaged backgrounds) who devote their
careers to issues that affect an aging population. California State University, Fullerton (CSUF), a Hispanic-
serving institution, proposes to implement a multidimensional aging science research education program titled
MSTEM Scholars Trained in Aging Research (MSTEM STAR). The goal of the MSTEM STAR program is to
increase diversity in the MSTEM aging research workforce by recruiting underrepresented MSTEM majors
interested in aging and helping them to develop the skills necessary to pursue the highest level of educational
attainment in their respective fields. The program has three specific aims. First, students will participate in
structured research experiences through one-on-one faculty research mentoring and an intensive summer
research experience at a local research-intensive (R1) university (i.e., UC Irvine, UCLA). Second, a student-
centered aging science curriculum will be developed, leading to a minor in Aging Studies, which will provide a
foundation in aging science, foster research skills, and promote an understanding of how the science of aging
relates to students’ lives. Finally, strong student support and engagement will be fostered by mentoring and
guiding students through extracurricular activities designed to improve professional skills and graduate school
preparedness. The MSTEM STAR program will include three two-year cohorts of six students each. Students
will be recruited as sophomores to participate in their junior and senior years. In addition to enrolling in aging-
science related coursework, students will be paired with MSTEM faculty research mentors at CSUF, and then
with an R1 research team for an intensive summer research experience following their junior year. A separate
support mentor will guide each cohort through skill-building activities and engagement opportunities with older
adults. Formal program evaluation efforts will be employed to track student success and to provide data for
future contributions to pedagogical best practices. Successful implementation and completion of this program
will increase the number of students from diverse backgrounds who are prepared for and successfully
undertake advanced degree programs in MSTEM fields related to aging. Research and education components
will be created with a focus on sustainability: The MSTEM STAR program is designed to endure beyond the life
of the grant, with the intent to continually prepare underrepresented students for graduate education in aging-
related MSTEM fields."
10816579,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Obesity is a global public health crisis, and its prevalence continued to increase dramatically during the last three
decades. Although numerous factors influence on body weight, excessive consumption of palatable foods (e.g.,
high-fat diet, HFD) is a major risk factor leading to obesity. Notably, most of the individuals who achieved a
successful diet with withdrawal from such foods show high rates of relapse to HFD overconsumption. Given that
this process is highly associated with the increased preference for palatable foods, understanding neural circuit
mechanisms leading to HFD overconsumption after abstinence is arguably the core issue in therapeutic
strategies for the long-term treatment of obesity. However, neither the specific neural circuit pathway nor the
molecular mechanisms underlying this process are well understood. Leptin, an adipose tissue-derived hormone,
exerts its anorexic effects by acting on its receptors in the hypothalamus. Activation of long leptin receptor (LepR)
stimulates multiple signal transduction pathways to suppress food intake and weight gain. While a decrease in
hypothalamic tissue sensitivity to leptin is characterized by a disturbance in the ability of LepR to activate
downstream effectors or impairment in LepR expression, we do not understand critical issues concerning primary
brain circuit that develops leptin insensitivity which can subserve relapse to HFD overconsumption. Thus, in this
proposal we aim to propose an interdisciplinary approach to understand the circuit-specific role of leptin
sensitivity in driving HFD overconsumption following abstinence from such foods. We will primarily focus on the
leptin-responsive circuit that connects the lateral hypothalamus (LH) to the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray
(vlPAG) and functionally probe its neural adaptation after HFD exposure. The central objective of this proposal
is to determine the neural dysfunction of LepR-expressing LH (LepR LH) neurons projecting to the vlPAG using
the intermittent access schedule of HFD to better understand the neural mechanisms underlying HFD
overconsumption when the food becomes more salient. To achieve our objective, we will first characterize in
vivo activity of target-specific LepR LH neurons during HFD consumption at different food stages. We will
examine whether the vlPAG-projecting LepR LH neurons are engaged in post-abstinence HFD overconsumption
(Aim 1). Secondly, using molecular profiling methods, we will examine how HFD abstinence induces circuit-
specific neural adaptation in the LepR signaling associated with HFD overconsumption (Aim 2). Third, we will
determine how LepR knockdown-induced leptin insensitivity in the LepR LH neurons regulates HFD consumption
and body weight with a circuit-specific manner (Aim 3). The significance of this study is substantial because it
represents the first steps towards understanding how leptin-responsive LH-vlPAG circuitry controls HFD
consumption that is exacerbated by abstinence. The contribution is innovative because it will provide, for the first
time, a framework for studying the circuit-specific role of leptin sensitivity in relapse to HFD overconsumption,
and in developing targeted therapies for the treatment of pathological symptoms in eating disorders and obesity."

Florida Atlantic University (FAU), the University of Miami (UM) and Florida International University (FIU)
propose a six-week Florida Summer Institute in Biostatistics and Data Science (Florida SIBDS) focused on
health disparities related to cardiovascular and infectious diseases. At present, Florida SIBDS would be the
first SIBDS in the southeastern United States. FAU and FIU are both Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSI) and
State Universities, and the University of Miami is a pre-eminent private institution with significant diversity.
Florida SIBDS is innovative: 1) It introduces rigorous quantitative careers to primarily Hispanic and African-
American young adults through the combined efforts of three ethnically diverse institutions; 2) The diverse
leadership team and faculty have unique complementary skillsets in biostatistics, epidemiology, health
economics, computational biology, AI, machine learning (ML), and big data analytics; and 3) SIBDS students
will be actively involved in “learning through teaching” to others, culminating in a short curriculum they will
teach to first year high school students. This novel partnership approach will address the shortage of
biostatisticians in government, academia and industry by providing a diverse, well-qualified pipeline of future
biostatisticians, many of whom may not have had the opportunity due to lack of awareness, educational access
and financial barriers. Florida SIBDS will recruit nationally to enroll 136 undergraduate and early graduate
school students over five years with requisite mathematics coursework and a budding interest in health, while
targeting groups typically underrepresented in the biomedical and behavioral sciences; recruitment methods
include social media, websites, professional organizations and personal contacts with administration and
student influencers. Florida SIBDS will engage students in a multi-faceted, peer and faculty mentored,
intensive 6-week training experience driven by research questions that highlight health disparities and social
drivers of health, using current cardiovascular, COVID-19 and HIV databases. Although the curriculum
encompasses basic, advanced and cutting-edge statistical and data science methods delivered in ways to
engage students, it also highlights scientific communication, collaborative skills, project teamwork, social
interactions and career guidance. Quantitative and qualitative methods will be used to evaluate peer and
faculty mentors and students annually. An External Advisory Committee, pedagogy and evaluation consultants,
leadership team and student advisors will use their experience and these data to inform the curriculum. Florida
SIBDS alumni will retain mentorships with faculty and have access to revised curriculums for five years after
completion."

Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) is the largest long-term study of brain development and child
health in the United States. The ABCD Research Consortium consists of 21 research sites across the country,
a Coordinating Center, and a Data Analysis and Informatics Resource Center. In its first five years, under RFA-
DA-15-015, ABCD enrolled a diverse sample of 11,878 9-10 year olds from across the consortium, and will track
their biological and behavioral development through adolescence into young adulthood.
All participants received a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging,
neuropsychological testing, bioassays, careful assessment of substance use, mental health, physical health, and
culture and environment. A similar detailed assessment recurs every 2 years. Interim in-person annual
interviews and mid-year telephone or mobile app assessments provide refined temporal resolution of
developmental changes and life events that occur over time with minimal burden to participating youth and
parents. Intensive efforts are made to keep the vast majority of participants involved with the study through
adolescence and beyond, and retention rates thus far are very high. Neuroimaging has expanded our
understanding of brain development from childhood into adulthood. Using this and other cutting-edge
technologies, ABCD can determine how different kinds of youth experiences (such as sports, school
involvement, extracurricular activities, videogames, social media, unhealthy sleep patterns, and vaping) interact
with each other and with a child’s changing biology to affect brain development and social, behavioral, academic,
health, and other outcomes.
Data, securely and privately shared with the scientific community, will enable investigators to: (1) describe
individual developmental pathways in terms of neural, cognitive, emotional, and academic functioning, and
influencing factors; (2) develop national standards of healthy brain development; (3) investigate the roles and
interaction of genes and the environment on development; (4) examine how physical activity, sleep, screen time,
sports injuries (including traumatic brain injuries), and other experiences influence brain development; (5)
determine and replicate factors that influence mental health from childhood to young adulthood; (6) characterize
relationships between mental health and substance use; and (7) specify how use of substances such as
cannabis, alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine affects developmental outcomes, and how neural, cognitive, emotional,
and environmental factors influence the risk for adolescent substance use."

The whisker-barrel system of mice is a popular neurobiological model for studies of neural mechanisms of pattern
formation in the brain, activity-dependent refinement of connections, experience and use-dependent plasticity of
cortical circuits, and sensory and cognitive deficits in mouse models of neurodevelopmental and disorders. One
of the features that makes this system very attractive is that the patterned array of whiskers on the snout is
represented by neural models at several levels of the somatosensory pathway. Over the past several decades,
numerous studies demonstrated the importance of the sensory periphery and the intrinsic molecular cues of the
thalamus and cortex in patterning of this system. We have been working on a unique mutant mouse model,
where the periphery is intact, thalamic and cortical cues are intact but the ascending somatosensory pathway
between the brainstem and thalamus is disrupted, leading to bilateral whisker map and pattern formation in the
thalamus and cortex. Our studies during the current funding period revealed several morphological and
behavioral phenotypes in this mouse line.
 Our continuation studies will have three aims:
1. To complete circuit mapping along the thalamocortical and corticocortical pathways in mice with
trigeminothalamic axon guidance defects in the brainstem. We ask the following questions: How does the bifacial
map in the SI cortex affect S1-M1 (primary motor cortex) and callosal connections?
2. To determine functional organization of “bifacial” responses in areas downstream of S1, and consequences
on perceptual behavior. We will record electrophysiologically in vivo across cortical layers using 64-channel
laminar silicon probe arrays. We will next conduct cellular-resolution calcium imaging from wM1 in awake mice
to map downstream cortical consequences of the bifacial map. We will test the Krox20cre/Robo3lox/lox mice for
whisker discrimination tasks with optogenetic silencing to probe brain’s use of bifacial map.
3. To determine the operating rules of critical period plasticity in this bifacial system. We ask the following
questions: What are the characteristics of critical period plasticity in bilateral cortical maps in response to injury
or sensory deprivation? How does unilateral sensory deprivation affect each of the maps in the cortex?"

Sjögren’s Disease (SjD, formerly known as Sjögren’s syndrome) is a common systemic autoimmune
rheumatic disorder second only to rheumatoid arthritis in prevalence. It primarily affects salivary and lacrimal
glands through lymphocytic infiltration and autoantibody-mediated inflammation, resulting in significant
morbidity. Approximately one third of SjD patients have extraglandular involvement and have a remarkably
elevated risk for lymphoma. Unfortunately, limited progress has been made in addressing the many unmet
needs in SjD. Confirmatory diagnosis is multidisciplinary in nature and often results in significant delay. Scant
therapeutic options exist outside of symptom management, and results from recent clinical trials have been
disappointing. Thus, a better understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms of disease is critical, and can
be achieved using a de- and re-construction approach. Central to this goal, is the need for deeply
characterized patients with SjD. The multidisciplinary Sjögren’s Team for Accelerating Medicines Partnership
(STAMP) is ideally poised to assemble this resource. The team’s expertise includes autoimmunity-focused
molecular biology, genetic, and epidemiologic/clinical research, and a remarkable track-record in establishing
large cohorts of participants with stored biospecimens and exquisitely detailed phenotypic characterization.
In addition to recruiting new participants, the existing cohorts will provide the unique opportunity to perform
10 to 15-year follow-up of previously evaluated SjD participants. Our proposed Disease Team (DT) is
strategically positioned to apply cutting-edge technologies to interrogate the tissue and systems
biology of SjD to identify therapeutic pathways and targets, with the following aims: 1) Planning Phase:
Develop a 5-year scientific research agenda and SOPs for phenotyping SjD patients in collaboration
with other AMP DTs and Technology and Analytics Cores (TACs). Design standardized protocols to
recruit, enroll, collect biospecimens and perform deep phenotyping of observational cohorts of SjD and

and natural history at both tissue and cell levels; 2) Pilot Phase: Calibrate clinical assessments and
sample procurement across recruitment sites and evaluate SOPs. We will work closely with other DTs
and TACs to a) finalize SOPs and implement them at all sites; b) leverage our multidisciplinary expertise to
initiate the deconstruction-reconstruction of SjD via preliminary analyses of molecular and clinical data; 3)
Scale up Phase: Increase participant recruitment and work with TAC to molecularly deconstruct and
reconstruct SjD. Standardized protocols implemented across sites will enable STAMP to interrogate the
tissue and systems biology of SjD using deep sequencing and other cutting-edge technologies, to better
understand 1) the pathogenesis of SjD and identify therapeutic targets, and new biomarkers; and 2) disease

As asthma worsens, occlusion of airways with mucus significantly contributes to airflow obstruction. In addition,
individuals suffering with asthma are often susceptible to viral respiratory infections which may lead to severe
worsening of disease symptoms. Recent evidence has suggested mucus obtained from individuals with severe
asthma possesses altered mucin composition. However, how these changes alter the functional properties of the
mucus gel is not yet fully understood. The overall objectives in this application are to (i) establish new models
where mucus composition can be precisely controlled for mechanistic assessment of its function and (ii)
understand the role of mucus composition in viral infection-induced exacerbation of disease. The central
hypothesis is airway mucus with an imbalanced concentration of the 2 primary gel-forming airway mucins,
MUC5B and MUC5AC, possesses significantly altered biophysical properties that leads to mucus
overaccumulation and impaired function of mucus as a barrier to respiratory viruses in asthma. The central
hypothesis will be tested through development of genetically engineered human lung tissue culture models
capable of producing mucus with a composition representative of healthy and asthmatic airways. Our approach
will enable for a mechanistic understanding of conditions under which the mucus gel becomes immobile, thus
reducing its ability to be effectively cleared and increasing the likelihood for mucus plug formation in the lungs
of individuals with asthma. In addition, we will explore the impact of mucin composition on the barrier function
of mucus towards influenza virus. Based on these mechanistic studies, we will develop a new mucin-targeted
therapeutic approach to reverse disease symptoms and prevent severe infection which will be tested using a
mouse model of allergic asthma. The research proposed in this application is innovative as it employs tools from
molecular biology, biophysics, and engineering to develop a novel means to manipulate and assess mucus
composition by closely mimicking its properties in healthy and asthmatic airways. If successful, the results of
this work will be significant as our approach may provide new insights into the biological function of mucus in
asthma, also with relevance to other related muco-obstructive lung diseases. This work aligns with the goals of
the Stephen I. Katz mechanism as it represents a significant shift in research direction for the PI using unique
approaches and new techniques to address long-standing questions on the emergent properties of MUC5B and
MUC5AC in asthma."

Our long-term goal is to engineer therapeutic immune cells that can report on and treat early-stage type 1
diabetes (T1D). Ideally, these cells should home to islets, detect and integrate multi-factor signatures of early-
stage disease and, in response, induce localized immunosuppression to block destruction of beta cells. Although
this seems like an extraordinarily difficult multi-level challenge, the remarkable progress in engineering immune
cells to recognize and kill cancer has generated a broad set of new technologies and approaches that could be
brought to bear on cell-based therapies for T1D. Here we propose to repurpose, redirect, and extend cell
engineering approaches to construct synthetic immune cells (CD4+ T cells) capable of sensing and treating
early-stage autoimmune disorders like T1D. Given the multiple challenges in achieving this goal, we propose to
take a modular approach – we have broken up what an ideal anti-T1D cell therapy would have to achieve into
three distinct subtasks. Our focus will be on independently engineering and validating cell circuit modules that
can achieve these subtasks, which can then be linked together in multiple combinations to develop options for a
full therapy. These modular objectives are outlined in our specific aims:
Aim 1. ISLET SENSING/TARGETING | Engineer synthetic immune cell sentinels that recognize and
establish residence/activity in the pancreas/islets. Sensors of pancreatic/islet specific antigens; islet
restricted activation using synNotch receptors; and islet trafficking via synthetic adhesion proteins.
Aim 2. AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE SENSING | Engineer synthetic immune cells that sense and report on
local immune perturbations associated with T1D onset. Engineer sensors that detect presence of
autoreactive T cells and elevated local levels of specific inflammatory cytokines
Aim 3. IMMUNO-SUPPRESSIVE OUTPUT: Engineer therapeutic cells that protect islets by inducing local
immunosuppressive outputs in response to disease sensing. Engineer output responses encompassing
induced local production of suppressive cytokines (IL10, TGFb), inflammatory cytokine sinks (CD25), and other
beta-cell protective factors. We will test multiple configurations of linking the disease sensing circuits from Aims
1 and 2 to the suppressive outputs from Aim 3.
To develop innovative cell engineering platforms for treating T1D, we propose to focus on human pluripotent
stem cell (hPSC)-derived islets as a highly flexible system in which to evaluate the immunoprotective function.
hPSC-cells can be readily generated and genetically modified to add convenient model antigens for sensing or
killing, allowing for the rapid design-build-test iterative cycles for the circuit modules described above (i.e.,
making each aim non-dependent on the others). hPSC islets can also be used to assess immunoprotective
responses against a variety of islet-targeted cytotoxic T cells, both in vitro and in vivo (implantation in mouse
kidney capsule), making this platform ideal for proof-of-principle evaluation and cell circuit optimization."

 Brain arteriovenous malformation (bAVM) patients have a 50% risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) which
carries a high risk of severe morbidity and mortality. Although a surgical attempt is a conventional treatment for
the bAVM, the surgery for critical bAVM is associated with significant complications such as intraoperative
hemorrhage or death. Our long-term goal is to identify a preventative strategy for ICH in bAVM patients. The
inciting pathophysiology leading to bAVM rupture is unknown. Studies have shown that the presence of a bAVM
is highly correlated with local inflammation of intranidal and surrounding brain parenchyma.
Immunohistochemistry studies have identified dense concentrations of brain microglia and blood monocyte-
derived macrophages (we refer to them as M) surrounding the unruptured human bAVM. Meanwhile, clinical
studies found that 62% of human sporadic bAVM patients harbored KRAS mutations in vascular endothelial cells
(ECs). Here we found that ECs carrying KRAS mutation (KRAS-EC) induced inflammatory responses toward
cultured M that in turn disrupts EC junctions. This suggests that M-mediated inflammation drives bAVM
destabilization that may lead to bAVM rupture/ICH. To explore how KRAS-EC alter M phenotype and
destabilize bAVM, we established a novel bAVM/ICH mouse model that uses the ECs-specific AAV/BR1 to
deliver mutant KRAS (AAV-KRASG12V) into brain ECs (bEC). The KRASG12V/bEC mouse recapitulates human
bAVM pathology, including tangled vessels, incomplete mural cell coverage, spontaneous ICH, and neurological
deficits (Park 2021 Ann Neurol). In KRASG12V/bEC mouse, we showed that the number of Iba-1+ Mare increased
around unruptured bAVM. The mRNA or protein levels for inflammatory cytokines, Proteolytic enzymes,
angiogenic mediator, and adhesion molecule are increased in KRASG12V/bEC mice and in KRAS-EC themselves.
Furthermore, KRASG12V/bEC mice treated with clodronate liposome (to deplete M) or minocycline reduces early
microbleeds. Our preliminary study and existing literature strongly supporting the notion that the activated M-
mediated inflammation drives bAVM destabilization that may lead to bAVM rupture/ICH. In this proposal, we will
test our hypothesis that KRAS-EC recruit and activate M within bAVM territory and that these activated M in
turn exacerbate the (peri)vascular damage causing bAVM rupture/ICH and that inhibition of M can avert/delay
this process. In Aim 1, we will determine the mechanism causing Mactivation and BBB disruption in bAVM. In
Aim 2, we will evaluate the clinical relevance of M in bAVM rupture and ICH. We expect that the successful
completion of this preclinical study will uncover a causative role of Min bAVM rupture and ICH and will provide
evidence to test the potential for M modulation in the prevention of bAVM-associated ICH. Our proposal has
the potential for broad implications as M are commonly involved in most cerebrovascular diseases."
10817186,"ABSTRACT
Arteriovenous fistulae (AVF) are the preferred mode of permanent dialysis vascular access because of better
long-term survival and reduced infection risks as compared to dialysis grafts and catheters. Unfortunately, AVFs
have a maturation failure rate (defined as inadequate diameter and blood flow for dialysis) of over 50% at 6
months, which results in multiple additional interventions, and also a prolonged period of tunneled dialysis
catheter dependency with all of its attendant complications. Thus, AVF maturation failure results in a very
significant morbidity, mortality and economic cost.
We and others have previously demonstrated that AVF maturation failure occurs due to a peri-anastomotic
venous segment stenosis characterized by the de-differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) into a
synthetic phenotype, which then results in an aggressive venous neointimal hyperplasia. We have also
developed a unique expertise both in the biology of AVF maturation (Roy-Chaudhury) and in the signal
transduction mechanisms involved in VSMC phenotypic switching (Xi). We now plan to apply this combined
experience and expertise to study the signal transduction pathways responsible for AVF maturation failure.
The overarching central hypothesis of this proposal, therefore, is that environmental modulation of the insulin
receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) signal transduction pathway plays a key role in VSMC phenotype switching which
then results in neointimal hyperplasia and AVF maturation failure. We plan to address this central hypothesis
through three specific aims.
Specific Aim 1 will assess the impact of different combinations of hyperglycemia, uremia and genetic
manipulation of IRS-1 and Kruppel like factor 4 (KLF-4) on signal transduction/VSMC phenotypic switch
pathways using explanted venous (jugular) and arterial (carotid) VSMC from C57Bl/6 WT control mice. Specific
Aim 2 will assess the impact of this same upstream manipulation on signal transduction pathways, VSMC
phenotypic switch and clinical, hemodynamic and histological endpoints, in a validated mouse model of AVF
stenosis at 2, 7 and 14 days, post-surgery. Finally, Specific Aim 3 will assess the impact of nutlin-3, an inhibitor
of MDM2 mediated ubiquitination of p-53 (which inhibits VSMC phenotypic switching) on the in-vitro and in-vivo
end points described in Specific Aims 1 and 2 respectively.
If successful, this novel, innovative, mechanism driven and pre-emptive approach to the intractable problem of
AVF maturation failure, could significantly reduce the clinical morbidity and economic cost associated with this
unmet clinical need."

Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) can cure many hematologic cancers and other life-
threatening hematologic diseases but 20-50% of survivors develop chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD),
the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in transplant survivors. Chronic GVHD is an iatrogenic
complication that can affect multiple organs, leading to clinical manifestations similar to autoimmune diseases
such as systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren’s syndrome, and lichen planus. Chronic
GVHD requires prolonged treatment with potent immunosuppressive agents and is associated with high
symptom burden and poor quality of life. The precise pathophysiology is unclear in humans. There are data
supporting involvement of T and B cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, cytokines,
chemokines and other proteins. However, information is derived from studies with few patients having
heterogeneous clinical manifestations. This renewal application will address key gaps in our understanding:
Can we identify biologically relevant cGVHD subgroups by studying large numbers of patients and using
sophisticated analytic techniques to identify “clusters” of similar patients? Is personalized medicine possible
based on knowledge of underlying pathophysiology and the likelihood of response? To address these
questions, we will use our extensive biorepository to test whether plasma proteins and peripheral blood cellular
populations cluster with clinical manifestations. While these studies are ongoing, a new cohort will be enrolled
to prospectively test the cluster findings and to investigate early biomarkers for treatment response.
Participants will be enrolled prior to starting a new systemic initial or second-line cGVHD treatment, then
followed at 1, 3 and 6 months later to assess clinical response. Successful completion of these aims will
advance our understanding of the biologic underpinnings of the different forms of human cGVHD and guide
therapeutic approaches, in order to decrease the morbidity and mortality of this common transplant
complication."
10817105,"Our main objective is to use quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) in establishing reliable noninvasive MRI
for identification and risk stratification of unstable carotid atherosclerotic plaques. Currently, decisions about
carotid revascularization to prevent stroke, such as carotid endarterectomy or carotid artery stenting, are based
on whether there is ?50% carotid artery stenosis. However, this strategy uses only one feature of vulnerable
plaque and frequently misclassifies patients. Using imaging to identify other features of rupture-prone carotid
plaques with high risk for thromboembolic stroke, in combination with stenosis assessment, proves to be a
more effective approach for risk evaluation. Of these features, intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH) is associated with
a 4 to 6-fold higher risk of stroke, while calcification is associated with a 50% lower stroke risk. In the
conventional approach, IPH and calcification are defined as hyperintensity and hypointensity, respectively, in a
plaque region on the T1-weighted (T1w) image acquired as part of the multi-contrast MRI (mcMRI) protocol.
However, T1w hyperintensity only captures the transient methemoglobin phase of hemorrhage. In the ensuing
hemosiderin phase, IPH appears hypointense due to the strong susceptibility-induced dephasing effects of the
superparamagnetic hemosiderin (susceptibility>150 ppm), which can be misinterpreted as calcification,
although calcification is strongly diamagnetic (-2.3 ppm). The key scientific premise of this proposal is that
QSM can reliably resolve T1w hypointensity into IPH hemosiderin versus calcification based on their different
magnetic property, and therefore will significantly improve imaging characterization and risk stratification of
patients with atherosclerotic carotid plaques. We have pioneered QSM development and demonstrated the
exquisite sensitivity of QSM for hemorrhage and calcification in carotid plaque. In this project, we will further
improve the utility of carotid plaque QSM for routine clinical imaging by developing a multi-contrast QSM
(mcQSM) approach which can provide not only QSM but also traditional mcMRI contrasts in 5 min scan time.
We will develop a nonlinear QSM reconstruction algorithm which is robust against noise and motion and can
separate co-existing IPH and calcification to improve IPH detection in calcified vessels. We will then establish
the improvement in diagnostic accuracy of mcQSM over mcMRI for detecting IPH and calcification in patients
who are scheduled for carotid endarterectomy. Finally, we will test the hypothesis that mcQSM will provide
significantly higher discrimination for stroke than mcMRI. A successful outcome of this proposal will make
carotid plaque QSM ready for widespread and routine clinical use in the emerging era of personalized
medicine to reduce the individual and societal burden of stroke."

suggests that not everyone may need the addition of behavior therapy to buprenorphine to reduce opioid use,
but that certain subgroups of people may benefit from behavior therapy. The ability to understand
heterogeneity in response to treatment for opioid use disorder is hampered by the need for very large sample
sizes to test questions about moderators of treatment response. Understanding subgroup differences can
ultimately inform personalized medicine approaches to the treatment of opioid use disorder. Our objective for
this proposal is to answer urgent questions about subgroup responses to behavioral therapy by harmonizing
data from 4 completed clinical trials of treatment for opioid use disorder. These NIDA-funded randomized trials
each tested the efficacy of behavior therapy added to buprenorphine maintenance for opioid use disorder and
include common data elements, allowing for their harmonization. Our project aims include: (1) to identify
subgroups who respond to behavior therapy when added to buprenorphine maintenance for opioid use
disorder, (2) to quantify the efficacy of behavior therapy for improving buprenorphine treatment retention, and
(3) to quantify the efficacy of behavior therapy for functional outcomes. The results from this study will provide
important information about who responds to behavior therapy and the effect of behavior therapy on non-opioid
use endpoints. Our proposal will utilize well-validated longitudinal data analysis methods, including a rigorous
approach to missing data. By using existing datasets, this proposal provides an efficient way to answer urgent
questions about the treatment of opioid use disorder and provides significant added value to these trials. These
findings can be immediately used to inform personalized approaches to treatment for opioid use disorder and
will also contribute to understanding of the impact of behavior therapy on endpoints of interest to patients and
families."

Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a pervasive and debilitating disease, affecting over 15 million people in the US
alone. Symptoms include pain, stiffness, and ultimately loss of joint function. Medical therapies are the
mainstay of treatment as surgical joint replacement is typically reserved for advanced disease. Only half of
patients treated by medical management with disease not severe enough to warrant surgery experience
adequate pain relief, resulting in an estimated population of 3.6 million Americans who are left suffering.
Genicular artery embolization (GAE) is a novel, minimally invasive treatment that uses radiologic techniques to
catheterize pathologically hyperemic genicular arteries using live X-ray guidance with subsequent occlusion of
these vessels using injected microspheres. GAE is performed to inhibit or blunt synovial inflammation thought
to be a primary phenotype of KOA. While initial GAE studies have shown to significantly reduce pain
associated with KOA, these studies do not account for the greater than 40% placebo effect known to occur
with KOA treatments. A sham-controlled study is therefore central to validating the efficacy of this procedure.
Prior to performing this pivotal trial, we propose to conduct a pilot sham-controlled GAE study of 40 patients to
document feasibility of enrollment and understand the magnitude of effect between these two interventions for
future statistical power analysis. We also hope to establish MRI as an objective tool that can quantify changes
in the degree of synovitis and knee perfusion that occurs after GAE to anchor these findings to the patient’s
subjective pain response. If the results of this study are positive, we plan to conduct a definitive sham-
controlled study to justify the use of GAE in medically refractory KOA and help provide a treatment option to
the millions of people with this disease."
10801555,"Freezing of gait (FOG) is a common and debilitating manifestation of advanced Parkinson’s disease (PD) for
which there are limited treatment options. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is
effective in approximately half of patients with FOG (PwF), and its effects wane over time. We propose a
multimodal neuroimaging study which uses diffusion MRI to understand the structural connections of the
individual stimulation area, as well as the microstructural integrity of key nodes in the network. This study will
also study the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response to STN-DBS in PwF. The long-term goal of this
research is to optimize FOG response to STN-DBS by identifying contributing modifiable factors. We propose to
do so by: 1) studying differences in BOLD response to STN-DBS between responders and non-responders, 2)
studying how the site of stimulation affects structural connectivity in responders compared to non-responders,
and 3) studying differences in microstructural integrity of regions directly affected by STN-DBS (STN, GPi, PPN).
Specifically, we aim to: 1) identify differences in BOLD activation based on FOG response to STN-DBS, 2)
identify differences in structural connectivity to the stimulation site based on FOG response to STN-DBS and 3)
identify differences in microstructural integrity of key network nodes. We will recruit PwF selected to undergo
DBS surgery and perform structural imaging and behavioral assessments at baseline followed by combined
DBS/fMRI studies and further behavioral assessments postoperatively and longitudinally. By achieving these
aims we will have evaluated the contribution of lead placement, stimulation parameters, structural connectivity,
and BOLD activation to FOG response which will be integrated to generate a mechanistic model of FOG
response to STN-DBS. The proposed study is innovative in two major ways: 1) we propose a novel conceptual
framework incorporating intrinsic and extrinsic factors that may affect FOG response to STN-DBS, and 2) we
propose a novel approach which integrates structural connectivity with microstructural integrity along the circuit
and to identify in-vivo functional network effects of STN-DBS activation in PwF. By developing a comprehensive
integrated mechanistic model of STN-DBS response we can begin to develop optimization strategies to enhance
engagement of the network. This approach will also further our understanding of the long-term therapeutic effects
of STN-DBS by capturing longitudinal changes in functional network activation."

Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common and severe lifelong neuromotordisability in childhood, affecting

United States each year. Asphyxia at birth, a presumed cause of CP, is present in less than
10% of all cases. The causes for most CP cases remain unexplained. Fetal brain development is vulnerable to

resources exist to study potential environmental exposure effects on CP. Here, we propose to conduct a powerful

them to the birth records. We will leverage the PESCP and select 450 congenital CP cases, 450 population and
85 preterm controls without CP, and retrieve maternal serum and newborn dried blood-spot samples from the
biobanks (2005-2016) to derive prenatal exposure (PFAS and PBDE) and metabolomic markers. We have

10802082,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The brain is one of the common organs for breast cancer recurrence. Breast cancer brain metastasis is
increasingly becoming a significant clinical problem due to its rising incidence and limited efficacy of existing
systemic therapies. Metastasis is the consequence of favorable interactions between the invaded cancer cells
and the microenvironment in the distal organ. To cancer cells, the brain has the most unique
microenvironment since the stromal cells in the brain do not exist in any other organs. This explains why
therapeutic strategies, which efficiently diminish primary and non-brain metastatic breast tumors, are
ineffective in controlling the established brain lesions. Our current work aims to understand the unique brain
metastasis microenvironment and delineate how it facilitates metastatic outgrowth. Type I interferon (IFN)
signaling is a well-recognized anti-tumor pathway. However, experiments from our animal models show that
type I response in astrocytes, the unique brain stromal cells, has a pro-metastatic effect in the brain. Based
on these findings, we will further address the following questions: 1) Define the underlying mechanisms in
how the type I IFN response in astrocytes mediates brain metastasis. We will test the hypothesis that the
activated IFN response in astrocytes helps the recruitment of specific immune cells into the brain lesions. 2)
Validate the type I IFN activation at different stages of brain metastasis. We will apply the top-notch imaging
technique in our mouse models to directly visualize cellular and molecular changes as they occur in real-time,
and validate these observations in clinical samples. 3) Investigate the therapeutic effect of inhibition of
immune cell recruitment on brain metastasis. We will not only identify the druggable targets, but also optimize
the therapeutic windows in our pre-clinical mouse models. Overall, our idea is that once we know how the
brain microenvironment helps cancer growth in the brain, we can focus our efforts on stopping it. Our research
proposal will yield real and actionable targets on brain microenvironment, instead of on cancer cells, to treat
brain metastasis. More importantly, our studies on tracking the dynamic changes during brain metastatic
process will help identify the optimal therapeutic strategies to effectively treat brain metastasis and minimize
potential side effect."

Melanoma arises from transformation of melanocytes (MCs) in the basal layer of the epidermis where they are
surrounded by keratinocytes (KCs). While
promote
extrinsic
much effort has been devoted to determining how MC driver mutations
 melanoma development, tumorigenesis also depends on non-genetic environmental factors. How
 factors cooperate with driver mutations to promote MCs to adopt a particular cell fate is poorly
understood. We identified the keratinocyte (KC)-specific cadherin Desmoglein 1 (Dsg1) as a mediator of KC:MC
communication. Best known as a keratinocyte-specific adhesion molecule of stratified mammalian epithelia, we
demonstrated that its transient downregulation like that occurring in response to ultraviolet radiation (UV) initiates
a protective tanning response in MCs. However, chronic Dsg1 loss stimulates pathogenic pro-inflammatory
cytokine production. Our work supports the hypothesis that melanoma cells hijack UV response pathways to
downregulate Dsg1 in neighboring KCs, creating a pro-inflammatory environment that drives transforming MCs
and melanoma cells to adopt new cell fates and bypass check points to tumor progression. To test this, we will:
1) Determine the stage-wise mechanisms that promote MC transformation and melanoma development
through KC Dsg1 loss. We propose that KC Dsg1 loss alters adjacent MCs through paracrine and contact-
mediated signaling, acting as a non-genetic hit to drive melanomagenesis. Using novel transcriptional reporters,
barcoding with scRNA-Seq to track cell fates, and label free phase imaging to track single cell behaviors, we will
address how KC Dsg1 loss helps a) MCs with driver mutations in BRAF and the tumor suppressor CDKN2A and
b) paired non-invasive and invasive melanoma cells adopt cell fates that promote melanoma progression. Human
3D epidermal co-cultures and a novel Dsg1-deficient cKit-driven oncogene mouse model will be used to
determine how cell fates adopted in response to Dsg1 loss drive oncogenesis in the context of the epidermal
environment. 2) Determine how melanoma cells downregulate KC Dsg1 to promote their own tumorigenic
potential. We hypothesize that mutant MCs or melanoma cells chronically suppress Dsg1 in perilesional KCs to
create a pro-tumorigenic KC:melanoma cell niche. Like UV, paracrine signaling from melanoma cells increases
the activity of the transcriptional repressor SNAI2/Slug, decreasing nuclear Grhl1, a known transcriptional
regulator of Dsg1. We will determine how melanoma cells mediate transcriptional reprogramming of KCs for their
own benefit. The extent to which oxidative stress, present in both UV-exposed and melanoma tissues,
cooperates with melanoma-derived factors to reduce Dsg1 will be determined. Transcriptional and proteomic
analysis will be used to validate the spatiotemporal progression of changes in human tumors that downregulate
Dsg1. This work promises to illuminate a new pathway by which extrinsic factors drive melanomagenesis, and
to open up avenues for development of biomarkers predictive of invasive disease and acquisition of drug
resistance, as well as cancer interception strategies for patients at high risk of developing malignant melanoma."
10801563,"Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are the leading cause of lower extremity amputations in the US and are
responsible for more hospitalizations than any other complication of diabetes. The sheer number of diabetic
ulcers that progress to amputation underscores the inadequacy of conventional therapies and the need for
novel approaches. Phagocytic leukocytes - particularly neutrophils - play a major role defending wounds from
invading pathogens. Yet, despite excessive neutrophil influx and persistent non-resolving inflammation,
DFUs are highly vulnerable to infection with pathogenic bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and
Staphylococcus aureus, which further contribute to their impaired healing. Although, impairments in the
diabetic neutrophil’s bactericidal functions have been blamed for this major co-morbidity, what causes these
impairments and whether they can be corrected or overcome, remain poorly understood.
Recently, we demonstrated that neutrophil trafficking is delayed in diabetic wounds, and this delay in neutrophil
response, renders diabetic wounds vulnerable to infection early after injury, which in turn exacerbates wound
damage and impairs healing. We further showed that reduction in the formyl peptide chemokine receptors (FPR)
in diabetic neutrophils (due to high glucose) is responsible for this delay. We found some auxiliary receptors
(e.g., CCR1) that remained functional under diabetic conditions but they were not functioning because of
their ligands were not adequately expressed in diabetic wounds during the acute phase of healing early after
injury. Importantly, we showed that one-time topical treatment with CCL3 (a ligand for CCR1) restored the
dynamics of neutrophil and inflammatory responses in diabetic wounds, which in turn reduced infection by
>99%. CCL3 treatment also substantially improved wound healing in diabetic mice.
Diabetic neutrophils are known to have impairments in their bactericidal functions, although it remains unclear
what causes these impairments. It remains unclear how neutrophils (recruited into diabetic wounds by CCL3
treatment) could destroy bacteria and reduce infection if they have bactericidal functional impairments.
In this proposal, we will determine the molecular mechanism(s) underlying impaired antimicrobial functions
in diabetic neutrophils (Aim 1). We will also evaluate CCL3 therapeutic doses and assess their efficacies and
safety profiles in diabetic mice and diabetic pig models (Aim 2).
If we are successful, our studies will fill crucial scientific gaps and reveal mechanistic insights regarding
defective mechanisms underlying impaired bactericidal functions in diabetic neutrophils. They will also
determine the optimum dose(s) and delivery mechanism of CCL3 for topical clinical use to control infection
and to stimulate healing in diabetic wounds. Aim 2 will also enable us to obtain an IND for topical therapeutic
application of CCL3 in human diabetic patients with non-healing ulcers and has the potential to be applicable
to all wounds."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and dementia present enormous social and economic burdens to the United States.
In 2019, AD was recognized as the sixth leading cause of death (121,499 cases) in the nation. The number of
AD cases within the country is predicted to rise to 13.8 million by the year 2060. Most cases are sporadic in
nature and their molecular causes remain unknown. A clinical report from last year suggests that the Complex I
deficiency may cause early onset AD in humans. This report linked a pathogenic mutation in the NDUFA1 gene,
which encodes an essential subunit of Complex I. Therefore, we will test the hypothesis that Complex I
deficiency predisposes to AD and dementia by elevating neuroinflammation and proteinopathy. It may
also confer sex disparity in the disease susceptibility. To test this hypothesis, we propose studies with two
specific aims. Aim 1) will determine the effects of Complex I deficiency on humanized Aβ proteinopathy. Aim 2)
will determine the susceptibility of Complex I-deficient mice to AD and dementia. We will cross the Complex I-
deficient Ndufa1S55A mice with ApphAβ mice that express humanized amyloid beta (hAβ) to generate double
knock-in mice (Ndufa1S55A-ApphAβ). These mice Ndufa1S55A-ApphAβ will be used to determine predisposition to
AD and dementia in the presence and absence of humanized Aβ. Proteinopathy due to Aβ aggregation is one
of the hallmarks of AD. Therefore, in Aim 1, we will develop a real-time quaking induced conversion (RT-QuIC)
assay to quantify Aβ proteinopathic seeds present in brain and blood. In Aim 2, we will perform biochemical and
histopathological evaluation to assess the levels of Aβ plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, neuroinflammation,
neuronal loss, and synaptic degeneration in mice brains. We will also assess cognitive decline by behavioral
assays for spatial learning and memory. We expect to demonstrate that Complex deficiency increases
susceptibility to AD and dementia in the presence of humanized Aβ. The outcome of this project will have a
significant impact on our understanding of the risks of AD and dementia, which can help in early diagnosis and
prevention."

Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) for the study of high-consequence pathogens, including select agents
and toxins. The Tulane University RBL, which came online in June 2010, has been critical for
advancing research at the TNPRC and across the region on biodefense agents and emerging
infectious diseases, with a primary focus on in vivo studies using NHPs. Since its inception,
significant infrastructure projects have been completed to capitalize on the presence of the RBL
and grow and diversify research at the TNPRC. In recent years, and particularly with the onset of
the COVID-19 pandemic, the TNPRC RBL has expanded its capabilities and capacity to
accommodate BSL-3-level emerging pathogen and biodefense research. The overarching goal
of the proposed project is to strategically enhance and fortify BSL-3 research capabilities within
the TNPRC RBL to ensure the long-term success of this program in support of infectious disease
and biodefense research and countermeasure development. This will be accomplished through
the following Specific Aims: (1) Ensure agility of the TNPRC RBL response to emerging public
health concerns and threats by leveraging the robust research infrastructure and unique research
strengths of the TNPRC and implementing exceptional preventative maintenance processes that
allow for best practices, quality control, and extensive safety oversight for work with high-
consequence pathogens. (2) Provide formal structure for sharing of best practices for safety,
research procedures and facilities management with partners and other RBLs. (3) Coordinate
practices and procedures across the Biodefense Facilities Network to leverage the strengths of
all 12 RBLs; ensure efficient and effective cross-training and sharing of methodologies, SOPs,

Postpartum depression is one of the most common complications of childbirth. Untreated postpartum depression
can have substantial adverse effects on the well-being of the mother and child, negatively impacting child cog-
nitive, behavioral, and emotional development with lasting consequences. The underlying pathophysiology of
postpartum depression is largely unknown, creating an obstacle to developing improved treatments. The overall
goal of this study is to determine the relationships between GABAergic and glutamatergic neuroactive steroids,
cortical GABA and GLU concentrations and default mode network resting-state functional connectivity in women
with postpartum depression versus healthy postpartum and non-postpartum women. Our central hypothesis is
that high sustained amplitude neuroactive steroid exposure then withdrawal during the pregnancy and the post-
partum period versus the low brief amplitude neuroactive steroid exposure/withdrawal of the menstrual cycle, is
associated with differential cortical GABA and GLU concentrations within the default mode network and their
correlation to network resting state functional connectivity, with further differences between women with and
without postpartum depression. This study is a prospective observational study of 54 healthy peripartum comparison
women and 54 peripartum women with postpartum depression in comparison to a cross-sectional examination of 54
healthy women in the follicular stage of the menstrual cycle. Peripartum mood data and blood specimens will be ob-
tained at 2 antepartum and 2 postpartum study visits. Healthy postpartum comparison women and women with post-
partum depression will undergo a single functional MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy scan in the postpartum
period while healthy women in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle will complete a single study visit including
mood, blood and neuroimaging measures. The study will examine differences in default mode resting state functional
connectivity across groups (Aim 1), differences in GABA and glutamate concentrations across groups (Aim 2), corre-
lations between spectroscopy and resting-state functional connectivity (Aim 3) and explore correlations of spectros-
copy, resting-state functional connectivity, neuroactive steroids and depression in postpartum depression (Exploratory
Aim 1). Finally, half of the women with postpartum depression will complete a second imaging session after successful
postpartum depression treatment (Exploratory Aim 2) to determine GABA, glutamate and resting-state functional con-
nectivity changes associated with treatment. This data can then serve as an objective index against which to predict
response to current pharmacotherapies, identify new postpartum-specific therapeutic targets and measure po-
tential efficacy of newly developed treatments."

 The proposed Antiviral & Antimicrobial Countermeasures Discovery & Development Core (herein
abbreviated as A2CD2C) will facilitate biomedical research targeted toward the discovery and/or development
of countermeasures for prophylactic or therapeutic treatment of human biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) pathogens or
BSL-2 pathogens that mandate select agent control. The A2CD2C will enable this research using state-of-the-art
equipment for small molecule (1) screening, (2) imaging, (3) liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry
(LCMS/MS) services and (4) histology. The core will be housed within the UTHSC Regional Biocontainment
Laboratory (RBL) in BSL-3 space. The A2CD2C is significant in that it provides an efficient, integrated,
comprehensive platform that will facilitate studies from the initial discovery phase through pre-clinical
development within BSL-3 containment. The A2CD2C is unique within the RBL network in its focus on providing
LC-MS studies for infected, treated animal tissues in BSL-3 to provide much needed information of the site of
exposure of the therapeutic at the site of infection and thereby providing important pharmacodynamic information
required for preclinical assessment.
 The major mission of the A2CD2C is to maintain, improve and expand our RBL support services in drug
discovery and development with a focus on drug pharmacodynamics in terms of how and how much drug
exposure impacts pathogen survival. We propose three objectives to achieve herein: Objective 1. To maintain
A2CD2C support services in drug discovery and development; Objective 2. To improve A2CD2C support services
in drug discovery and development; and Objective 3. To expand A2CD2C support services in imaging in drug
discovery and development."

Our nation’s ability to detect, prevent and counter bioterrorism and emerging infectious diseases depends on
technologies that are generated through biomedical research on disease-causing microbes and understanding
human immune responses to infection. Following bioterrorism events in 2001, the National Institute of Allergy
and Infectious Diseases established the Regional Biocontainment Laboratory (RBL) Network, to promote safe
research in 12 Biosafety Level 3 (BSL3) laboratories. In turn, Institutions and Universities hosting these RBLs
sustained the management of these facilities, fostered a strong Biosafety culture, and fueled research inquiries
into the molecular mechanisms whereby microbes cause human disease. The University of Chicago hosts the
Regional Biocontainment Howard Taylor Ricketts Laboratory (HTRL) operated by its Department of
Microbiology since 2009. When this nation began to implement shutdowns to prevent the spread of COVID-19,
essential professionals at the HTRL continued key management operations and pivoted their expertise to study
SARS-CoV2. This momentum would not have been possible without the existing expertise and dedication of
engineers, biosafety officers, veterinary staff, scientists, as well as financial support from the University. The
goal of this proposal is to present a plan to maintain the safe operation and management of the BSL3 space of
the Regional Biocontainment HTRL and to continue training professionals who will provide research support
services for the development of measures necessary to mitigate and protect the public's health from infectious
diseases that may be the result of intentional, accidental, or naturally occurring health emergency. This plan
will be implemented by three cores. Core 1 Facility Management, Maintenance and Operations
(C1Facilities@HTRL) led by George Langan, describes activities that support continuous BSL3 containment
through decontamination, retesting, certification, preventive maintenance, repair or replacement of building
systems and compliance with Biosecurity, Environmental Health, and Biosafety regulations. Core 2 BSL3
Practices (C2BSL3Practice@HTRL) led by Joseph Kanabrocki, describes activities for the training of
personnel and the development of Standard Operating Procedures as well as activities to sustain a safe and
secure environment. Core 3 Biocontainment Research Support Services (C3ResearchSupport@HTRL)
led by Dominique Missiakas, describes research capabilities for the study of Risk Group 3 and Select Agent
pathogens. HTRL will use a web-based portal to advertise and offer research services such as isolation and
characterization of pathogens, virulence and countermeasure studies using in vitro and in vivo assays and
animal models. Monthly virtual and annual in-person meetings between RBL Directors will identify
opportunities for collaborations, improvements, and cross-training. These interactions will expand the capacity
of the RBL network as a whole to respond to public health emergencies, conduct evaluations of threats and
countermeasures, and provide education and training to conform with biosafety standards."

This is the renewal U2R application for the “Bangladesh Center for Global Environmental and Occupational
Health (GEOHealth)”- awarded along with the linked U01 grant in 2015 to the University of Chicago (UofC) and
International Centre for Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR,B). The project will be implemented
in close collaboration with the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU) and selected US as well
as local academic institutions to continue and augment complementary training expertise relevant to this
proposal. The goal of the Bangladesh GEOHealth Center was to strengthen the research capacity of Bangladesh
on pressing environmental and occupational health threats. During the current funding period, the Bangladesh
GEOHealth Center has positively impacted on the foundation of environmental health research capacity in
Bangladesh by training more than 200 students, young and mid-career researchers from diverse background
through custom-designed in-country 2-day workshops and 2-week short-courses, and 16 fellows through US-
based postdoctoral fellowships and 12-week (one academic quarter) training at the UofC. Evaluation of short
courses and workshops in Bangladesh indicated increased knowledge and high satisfaction of the participants.
The 16 fellows who received training at UofC have demonstrated outstanding research productivity in term of
publications, presentations, grants, and career development. They produced 90 peer-reviewed publications
during and after the training period. All 16 US-based fellows reported that they had cooperative and influential,
mentor(s) during the training period and the trainees continued to receive guidance from the mentor(s) even after
completion of the training. Despite these demonstrable impacts there remains a critical need for additional
research capacity in Bangladesh to address the country’s huge environmental and occupational health burden
given the acute shortage of researchers trained in modern environmental health research methods, especially
data science and mHealth tools and techniques. In this renewal application, we propose to continue and augment
our Bangladesh and US- based training activities through i. Workshops (2 day), ii. Short courses (1-2 week) iii.
One academic quarter course work at UofC, iv. A master’s degree program (1-year) at UofC, and v. Postdoctoral
training (1-year) at UofC. We will refine the training curricula that we used over the past 5 years to incorporate
more materials on utilizing advanced technologies and analytical tools (artificial intelligence/machine learning
(AI/ML), image analysis, mobile health (mHealth) data capture/analytics, exposure data science, etc.) for
analyzing environmental health data with the existing materials, all of which will incorporate the linked U01
application’s research focus. A rigorous evaluation system will help the Administrative and External Oversight
Committee to monitor and ensure program success. We have successfully implemented the current phase of
the training grant, and we believe that our renewal training program will address critical gaps in environmental
and occupational health research capacity, and bring benefit to a wide variety of researchers in Bangladesh."

Exposure to AAP, both short and long-term, is associated with higher morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, and there is increasing evidence for Alzheimer’s disease and dementia as well. AAP in Lima, Peru’s largest city, averaged 25 μg/m3 in 2010-2016. The 2nd largest city, Arequipa, averaged 72 μg/m3 at a downtown monitor in 2018. Both cities are far above WHO guidelines of 10 μg/m3. As in many other LMICs, AAP monitoring in Peru is limited; most observations taken by the government are limited to Lima and to a few ground monitors. We propose to extend our prior (2010-2016) 1 k2 -resolution PM2,5 model for Lima through 2025, and also develop a new Lima model for NO2. With these data we will study the association of traffic and air pollution in Lima and evaluate possible different mitigation strategies in terms of reducing air pollution and related respiratory diseases. We will also study the association of AAP and COVID-19 (and all pneumonia) incidence, mortality, and case-fatality in Lima in the year before vaccination was introduced; Peru was hit hard by COVID-19, and has the highest COVID-19 mortality rate in the world. We will also assess whether severe COVID-19 is associated with cognitive deficits 2-4 years afterwards, comparing 100 cases with 100 controls. In addition, we will conduct the first study of Alzheimer disease (AD) and fronto-temporal dementia (FTD) and air pollution in Lima, taking an advantage of an ongoing cohort study with over 500 cases and 500 controls, conducted by a leading Alzheimer’s disease center; in this study we will also assess whether Alzheimer’s disease cases, or fronto-temporal dementia cases were more likely to have had COVID than controls. We also plan to develop a national model for PM2.5 for Peru as a whole, with 5 k2 resolution, and a corresponding data base of hospital data and emergency room visits for all the major cities of the country. With these data we will estimate premature mortality from cardiovascular and respiratory disease due to PM2.5 in Peru. We may also be able to extend our study of Alzheimer’s disease to other urban centers outside of Lima. We will furthermore study possible mitigation strategies for PM2.5 nationwide, which will reduce both PM2.5 and greenhouse gases (produced from many of the same sources), and study their impact on Peru’s obligations to reduce greenhouse gases under the Paris accord."

The loss of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) is a critical pathophysiological event precipitating
development of hyperglycemia in Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Recent evidence suggests that loss of
GSIS in diabetes is associated with metabolic reprogramming toward reduced mitochondrial function; however
mechanisms underlying these observations remain largely unknown. Recent single cell transcriptomics studies
of human β-cells identified SLC4A4 as one of few unique genes highly expressed in T2DM β-cells and
repressed in non-diabetic β-cells. Slc4a4 encodes for Na+-nHCO3- cotransporter, NBCe1B in the pancreas and
plays a key role in regulating intracellular pH (pHi). Importantly, increased activation of NBCe1 has been
associated with enhanced intracellular glycolysis and impaired mitochondrial function suggesting it may
contribute to loss of GSIS and consequent development of T2DM. Preliminary dissertation studies support this
hypothesis and demonstrate that inhibition of NBCe1B activity in β-cells improves GSIS in vitro and enhances
glucose tolerance in vivo. These cumulative observations led us to develop a doctoral dissertation direction
with an overall objective to characterize the role of NBCe1B as a novel regulator of β-cell metabolism and
dysfunction in T2DM. Accordingly, Specific Aim 1 (F99) will test the hypothesis that β-cell dysfunction in T2DM
is driven by metabolic reprogramming mediated by cellular alkalization through activation of NBCe1B. Given
the critical role of NBCe1 in maintaining systemic pH homeostasis, the F99 uniquely positions me to elucidate
novel mechanisms associated with dysregulation of acid-base balance in the kidney during the K00 phase.
Specifically, the A-isoform of NBCe1 (NBCe1A) functions as the key mechanism of HCO3- reabsorption in the
kidney. Deletion of NBCe1A is associated with metabolic acidosis and cortical cysts within the collecting duct
(CD). Soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) has been identified as a HCO3- sensor within the CD. Previous work
demonstrated that impaired NBCe1A-mediated HCO3- reabsorption activates sAC-cAMP/PKA mediated
signaling. Interestingly, persistent cAMP/PKA activation within the CD has also been demonstrated to be a key
mediator of cyst development and proliferation in polycystic kidney disease (PKD). Therefore, the main
objective of my proposed postdoctoral research direction is to characterize the role of NBCe1A as a novel
regulator of cystogenesis through activation of sAC-cAMP/PKA signaling pathway. Accordingly, Specific Aim 2
(K00) will test the hypothesis that impaired NBCe1A-mediated HCO3- reabsorption activates a soluble adenylyl
cyclase-cAMP/PKA signaling cascade in the collecting duct promoting proliferation and cystogenesis in models
of PKD. Together, the F99 and K00 will propel me to achieve my long-term goal to lead an independent
research program in nephrology."
10795103,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Dendritic cells (DCs) are immune sentinel cells that can be activated by innate stimuli to orchestrate adaptive
immune responses. Conventional DCs (cDCs) efficiently present and cross-present antigens to prime T cell
responses, whereas plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) rapidly produce type I interferon (IFN-α/β, IFN-I) and other
cytokines in response to pathogen-derived nucleic acids. Recent studies revealed an intricate topological
organization of the genome into topologically associated domains (TADs) established through cohesin-
mediated loop extrusion and demarcated by binding sites of transcription factor CTCF. CTCF/cohesin-
mediated chromatin architecture is thought to control cell type-specific gene expression programs, thereby
facilitating cell differentiation and function. However, the topological chromatin landscapes of DCs and their
role in DC differentiation and function are poorly understood. The overall goal of the project is to characterize
the chromatin architecture in DCs and elucidate the chromatin-level control of DC function. In Aim 1, we will
examine the role of CTCF/cohesin-mediated regulation in the differentiation of DC subsets. In Aim 2, we will
analyze the role of cohesin in DC function, including cytokine responses and antigen presentation. In Aim 3,
we will analyze the architecture of the locus encoding IFN-I genes, and the role of chromatin in the control of
interferon production in DCs. Collectively, these results would provide novel insights into the role and
mechanism of chromosomal organization in the regulation of DC differentiation and function."

This application supports the participation of the University of the Chicago Medicine Comprehensive Cancer
Center (UCCCC) as a Lead Academic Participating Site (LAPS) in the National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN).
The NCTN develops and performs state-of-the-art early and late stage clinical trials for the treatment of adults
with cancer. UCCCC has been a long-standing member of the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology and NRG
Oncology, and of the cooperative groups that preceded the formation of the NCTN. The UCCCC will provide
multi-disciplinary scientific and administrative leadership in the design of innovative and potentially practice-
changing clinical trials within the NCTN. UCCCC faculty members will contribute to the NCTN as operational
leaders, committee chairs, committee vice-chairs, committee leaders, and study chairs, and as members of
NCI Advisory and Scientific Committees. Preliminary studies performed by UCCCC investigators at the
University of Chicago will be brought to the NCTN for large scale testing. Laboratories at the University of
Chicago will perform correlative studies that will support NCTN trials. University of Chicago senior faculty will
mentor young investigators to become future leaders in the NCTN. The UCCCC has the infrastructure for the
initiation and conduct of a wide spectrum of clinical trials, supported through the Cancer Clinical Trials Office
(CCTO), the primary component of the Clinical Protocol and Data Management (CPDM) unit of the Cancer
Center Support Grant, which manages the regulatory activities for all adult cancer-related clinical trials. NCTN
LAPS activities at UCCCC will be coordinated by a Steering Committee, comprised of 4 Principal Investigators
who represent medical, surgical, radiation, and gynecologic oncology, and 2 senior administrative leaders in
the UCCCC. The Steering Committee will oversee the NCTN Coordinating Center in the Cancer Clinical Trials
Office, which will provide centralized regulatory oversight and data quality control support for the
implementation, quality execution of, and efficient accrual to, NCTN trials across the Network. UCCCC will
collaborate with the Network Group Operations Centers and the associated Network Group Statistics and Data
Management Centers to achieve the research goals of the NCTN program. The UCCCC will thus provide a
mechanism for robust accrual to trials across the NCTN, with participation across all tumor types, including
trials for rare cancers and in a diverse patient population, at the UCCCC main campus in Hyde Park, at 3
Integral Network sites, and at 3 LAPS-aligned affiliate institutions."
10804627,"The first few months of post-stroke recovery is a critical time period where spontaneous changes in language
functions and underlying neural processes are observed. Imaging brain changes during this time may help
clinicians identify the recovery of neural processes, but must be done in a way that is not confounded by stroke-
induced cerebrovascular changes. This is important, as evidence suggests that cerebrovascular insult will elicit
a cascade of changes that leads to vascular remodeling in the first few months of post-stroke recovery. This
CDA2 proposal addresses this gap through development of a set of integrated multi-modal neuroimaging
methodologies to dissociate neural and vascular changes during recovery of language functions from early sub-
acute (2-6 weeks post-stroke) to late sub-acute phase (12-16 weeks post-stroke) in patients with aphasia.
In the first aim, we will determine if regressing out the vascular signals (CVR and CBF) from task Blood Oxygen
Level Dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI) activity at each time point (early and late phase) will improve
the relationship between change in task-BOLD activity and change in lexical decision behavior. Our approach
will be to track task-BOLD fMRI activity from early to late sub-acute phase while the patients participate in an
auditory word recognition task (lexical decision) in both phases. We will apply our sensitization scheme for
regressing out vascular signals. The change in BOLD amplitude (from sensitized and unsensitized/standard
task BOLD fMRI activity) will then be related to changes in the lexical decision behavior. We expect to see that
the neuro-sensitized task BOLD fMRI activity will have a stronger correlation with lexical decision measures
than the unsensitized/standard BOLD fMRI signal. In the second aim, we will determine if removing the
vascular signals from resting state BOLD (rs-BOLD) acquired from residual language network at each time
point (early and late phase) will improve the relationship between change in rs-BOLD network measures and
change in language (domain specific and domain general) measures. Our approach will be to acquire rs-BOLD
fMRI scans during the early and late sub-acute phase in patients with aphasia. We will then carry out a whole
brain voxel-wise network analysis (i.e. modularity) choosing apriori seed ROI from the residual language-
related brain areas. To sensitize the rs-BOLD fMRI signals to neural connections, we will carry out the same
sensitization scheme (as described in Aim 1) at a voxel level. We will then identify changes in language network
measures (from sensitized and unsensitized/standard rs-BOLD fMRI) and correlate them with language
behavior (domain specific and domain general). After completing Aim 2, it is our expectation that the proposed
sensitization scheme enhances the sensitivity of rs-BOLD network measures to brain network reorganization in
language specific and language-nonspecific cognitive domains. In the third aim, we will determine if vascular
measures (CBF and CVR) from early phase can predict change in language behavior (Western Aphasia Battery
measure of comprehension and Philadelphia Naming Test. Our approach will be to recruit patients with
aphasia in the early sub-acute phase and measure their vascular and behavioral recovery at both early and late
time points. Specifically, we will acquire voxel-wise CBF and CVR measures at the early time point, and using
multiple regression approach, we will model the vascular measures to predict change in clinically-relevant
language behavior. After completing Aim 3, it is our expectation that we will have a clinically translatable data
driven (vascular physiology-based) prediction model that can be used to identify brain regions that must
change to support improvements in language behavior. The expected outcome of this CDA2 is an integration of
multimodal neuroimaging tools to more accurately predict longitudinal recovery of language functions in sub-
acute patients with aphasia. The long-term goal is to determine how neuroimaging tools can best be used to
provide accurate individualized language recovery trajectories and predict treatment outcome."
10804635,"As biomechanical modeling of the breast is integral to predicting tumor location across multimodal
diagnostic imaging and during surgery, surgical planning, generating simulations for physician and patient
education, and brassiere and clothing design for optimal breast support, advances in model accuracy have the
potential to significantly improve women's health and quality of life. Despite the growing use of breast
biomechanical models for different applications, there are persistent knowledge gaps in both the anatomical and
biomechanical literature that prevent an accurate model from being developed and deployed to patient-specific
applications. Accurate biomechanical models are needed for tracking cancer in diagnostic imaging and surgery.
However, the accuracy of biomechanical models is sensitive to the geometrical and structural features used to
describe the anatomical features and the constitutive parameters used to describe the behavior of the tissues.
For example, small alterations in the stiffness of the various breast tissue properties can displace tissues by
more than 10 mm. Thus, thorough characterization of the constitutive properties of individual breast structures
are necessary to obtain precise predictions of tissue motion. Furthermore, in the absence of precise knowledge
of anatomical geometrical and structural features, biomechanical models have placed an overemphasis on the
constitutive parameters of the breast tissue.
 The long-term goal of our research is to develop an accurate biomechanical model of the breast that
transforms the applications of breast modeling for both population models and patient-specific applications. Our
vision is to improve the model so that it becomes a reliable and useful tool in the diagnosis and management of
breast cancer, surgeon education and training, patient education for better shared decision making, and clothing
design, especially in the post mastectomy recovery period.
 Our present human breast tissue biomechanical model represents the state of the art, as it is based on
actual 3D analyses. However, it represents a first step, as clinical translation remains limited by insufficient
information about the structural and biomechanical characteristics of the fascial support system and its
relationship to the adipose and glandular breast structures in the broader population. Thus, we hypothesize that
the accuracy of the biomechanical model may be improved by determining the anatomical and biomechanical
characteristics of the fascial support system of the breast, understanding the sensitivity of the patient-specific
parameters across the population, and validating the translation of these models, with their inherent
uncertainties, into the patient-specific setting. Our multi-disciplinary team of breast reconstructive surgeons,
engineers, medical physicists, and pathologists are uniquely poised to perform this innovative research leading
to the development of a high-fidelity biomechanical model of the human breast that is capable of reproducing its
behavior, both in general and in a patient specific sense."
10799973,"Candidate: This is a Career Development proposal for Dr. Rishi Chanderraj, an Infectious Diseases physician
with a Master's degree in Clinical Research Design and Biostatistics and expertise in integrating microbiome
and clinical data for translational research.
Specific aims: This proposal aims to test the hypothesis that depletion of gut anaerobes with anti-anaerobic
antibiotics leads to translocation of Enterobacteriaceae, inflammation, nosocomial infection, and death among
hospitalized Veterans with two complementary studies. Aim 1 will determine if anti-anaerobic antibiotics may
cause increased 30-day mortality. Dr. Chanderraj will leverage the resources of the Corporate Data
Warehouse (CDW) to conduct a retrospective cohort study of 87,321 patients treated with anti-anaerobic
piperacillin-tazobactam or anaerobe-sparing cefepime. A natural experiment caused by concurrent drug
shortages of piperacillin-tazobactam and cefepime will allow for estimating causal effects with a difference-in-
differences analysis. Aim 2 will investigate the microbiologic and immunologic consequences of gut anaerobe
depletion on hospitalized Veterans. Dr. Chanderraj will conduct a prospective cohort study of 30 piperacillin-
tazobactam-treated patients and 30 cefepime-treated patients, characterizing microbiota in the gut, skin, and
upper respiratory tract on hospital days 0, 2, and 4. He will collect time-matched markers of gut permeability
(intestinal fatty-acid binding protein and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein) and inflammation (IL-6 and CRP).
Regression modeling will determine whether anaerobe depletion precedes gut Enterobacteriaceae domination,
intestinal permeability, and systemic inflammation.
Impact: The proposal aligns with key VA research priorities of the Offices of Research and Development and
Clinical Science Research and Development in that it 1) increases the real-world impact of VA research, as the
study's results will impact current antibiotic practices and guide clinicians in reducing avoidable harm related to
antibiotic use, 2) puts VA data to work for Veterans by leveraging the vast resources of the Corporate Data
Warehouse, and 3) improves treatment optimization by characterizing clinical, microbiologic, and physiologic
changes associated with antibiotic use, ultimately guiding clinicians to avoid harm related to antibiotic use.
Career Development: With directed mentorship and didactic coursework, Dr. Chanderraj will complete his
training aims of 1) gaining mentored experience in the conduct of prospective, hands-on, patient-oriented
translational research, 2) learning new methods of interrogating host-microbiome interactions, 3) developing
new skills in big data analytics, and 4) developing expertise in methods of causal inference. Completion of this
proposal will equip Dr. Chanderraj with the necessary skills and preliminary data to conduct Merit studies that
use big data analytics to investigate the impact of ""common shocks"" on antibiotic use and outcomes, as well as
multi-center prospective studies to evaluate the impact of antibiotics on the microbiome and host physiology. It
will allow him to become an independent VA investigator with skills across the translational spectrum,
molecularly interrogating antibiotic treatment's microbiologic and physiologic consequences and translating
findings into improved care for Veterans.
Environment: Dr. Chanderraj's mentorship team consists of international leaders in microbiome science,
translational research, big-data analytics, and advanced causal inference methods. Dr. Chanderraj will perform
this research at the Ann Arbor VA and will benefit from the extensive research infrastructure of the VA Center
for Clinical Management Research, as well as the rich scientific environment of The University of Michigan and
the Michigan Microbiome Project, further bolstering his research capabilities."

Circuit-localized kinase signaling in the brain modulates local circuit activity and consequent behavioral output.
An enormous roadblock to understanding this core mechanism has been the inability to image kinase signaling
in vivo, but this barrier has finally been overcome with separation of phases-based activity reporter of kinase
(SPARK) biosensors, which can visualize rapid, reversible kinase enzymatic function in targeted brain circuits.
This proposal images 3 key pathways – protein kinase A (PKA), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and
calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) – both independently and in combination. We will test
roles of circuit activity, mapped neuromodulatory input, and kinase-kinase interaction in normal animals, as well
as behavioral learning/memory dysfunction and epileptic seizure disease models. The exquisitely mapped
Drosophila central brain mushroom body (MB) learning/memory center provides individually-identified MB inputs,
core Kenyon cells and MB output neurons for circuit-level dissection of kinase signaling in vivo, within an
expansive connectivity network. Learning acquisition and memory consolidation depends on Kenyon cells, which
have well-defined input/output connectivity nodes ideal for informed, targeted SPARK imaging studies. In Aim
1, we image bidirectional activity-dependent kinase signaling with PKA- and ERK-SPARK biosensors. To test
localized circuit signaling, we use neuron-targeted optogenetics, channel manipulations (e.g. TRPA1), and
neurotransmission blockade (e.g. transgenic tetanus toxin) to dissect activity-dependent kinase signaling. We
then assay the roles of this local kinase signaling on circuit function (employing GCaMP imaging) and on
learning/memory behavioral output. In Aim 2, we image behavioral learning/memory dysfunction and epileptic
seizure disease models for changes in circuit-localized kinase signaling. We then test the effects of genetic and
pharmaceutical correction of kinase signaling on circuit function, learning/memory and seizure behavior. We
assay the roles of defined neuromodulatory neuropeptide, serotonergic and dopaminergic synaptic inputs, using
neuron-targeted ligand/receptor RNAi to dissect regulatory mechanisms. In Aim 3, we generate and test an
essential new transgenic CaMKII-SPARK biosensor for in vivo circuit signaling studies. We image CamKII-
SPARK in activity interaction (as in Aim 1) and behavioral mutant model (as in Aim 2) analyses. We then test
kinase signaling, circuit function and behavioral output dependent on PKA/ERK/CaMKII signaling interactions.
We image all three SPARK biosensors in combination with loss-of-function and gain-of-function of the other
kinase signaling pathways, including Meng-Po kinase (human SBK1), which we propose balances/coordinates
local circuit function. In multiply mutant kinase combinations, we will test local circuit activity with targeted
GCaMP imaging, and consequent behavioral output in both learning/memory and seizure models. The overall
goal of this proposal is the genetic dissection of circuit-localized PKA, ERK and CaMKII interactive signaling as
an activity control in brain learning/memory circuitry, to improve both circuit function and behavior performance."

Candida albicans is one of the most prevalent fungal pathogen of humans and also a component of
the human microbiome; it can cause superficial infections in normal humans and life-threatening
systemic infections in immune compromised individuals. Our work seeks to understand how C.
albicans regulates its genes so it can survive and proliferate in the many different environments of its
human host. This proposal focuses on a single, large transcription circuit—the white-opaque switching
circuit—which allows two different cell-types to be produced epigenetically from the same genome.
White-opaque switching is deeply conserved across clinical isolates of C. albicans and is also
observed in closely related Candida species. This proposal seeks to understand the mechanism
behind white-opaque switching, the mechanisms underlying the stability of the two distinct, epigenetic
cell-types and the effects of white-opaque switching on Candida’s ability to thrive in its mammalian
hosts."

New HIV infection rates far outpace the targets set by global health organizations, despite important progress
in curbing the progression of the epidemic. In 2017, an estimated 1.8 million people became newly HIV
infected globally. New HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) strategies are needed urgently to curb this
alarming situation, particularly in young sub-Saharan African women who are disproportionately at risk. A high
proportion of women at risk of becoming HIV-infected also are interested in family planning, suggesting that a
dual-purpose product providing HIV prevention and contraception would significantly increase the likelihood of
higher uptake relative to single-purpose products, since unsurprisingly, women do not self-identify as being at
risk of HIV, but do so identify for pregnancy. Many women are averse to exogenous hormones and would
strongly prefer a nonhormonal method, and one that does not require use immediately before or after sex. Our
application integrates two leading innovations in developing a next generation multi-purpose technology (MPT)
intravaginal ring (IVR): (1) developing a novel, nonhormonal contraceptive agent based on a multivalent
monoclonal antibody (mAb) that blocks sperm from swimming through mucus and accessing the egg; and (2)
formulating the mAb contraceptive with antiretroviral (ARV) agents with demonstrated clinical efficacy in
preventing HIV in a behavior-monitoring IVR. We have recently engineered a unique IgG-based multivalent
mAb with 10 Fab arms against CD52g, a validated antigen target for contraception that is found only on cells in
the human male genital tract. This molecule, even at sub-nanomolar concentrations, effectively agglutinates
>99% of sperm within seconds, thus offering potentially potent yet cost-effective contraception. To complement
this novel agent, our team has developed an innovative IVR platform that delivers drug combinations including
small molecule drugs and mAbs. A low-cost module has been incorporated into the IVR to monitor temperature
as a surrogate measure of adherence. The MPT IVR will be formulated to provide long-term (30 days) dual
protection while evaluating adherence. In Aim 1, we will further enhance the mAb constructs against CD52g
through affinity maturation of anti-CD52g Fab using yeast-display, incorporate the optimized Fab into similar
multimeric mAb formats, and characterize their sperm agglutination potencies rigorously. In Aim 2, we will
formulate and evaluate in vitro human- and macaque-sized MPT IVRs to deliver our lead contraceptive mAb
candidate in combination with ARV drugs at target in vitro rates based on existing in vivo PK-PD data. We will
optimize and expand the adherence IVR design and evaluate prototypes in sheep. In Aim 3, we will assess the
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (safety and efficacy) of MPT IVR candidates in sheep and pigtailed
macaques. This project builds on an established collaboration of investigators and will advance our scientific
knowledge on the properties of sustained-release vaginal drug delivery in the context of HIV prevention and
contraception."

Thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) is a life-threatening disease and has a high mortality rate if rupture occurs.
Currently, apart from endovascular or open surgery repair, no drug has been demonstrated to be effective for
TAA treatment. Even though some patients with TAA have evidence of a heritable aortopathy, about 75% of
TAA patients have severe aortic damage without a clear genetic etiology. The scant mechanistic knowledge is
limiting the development of medications for the treatment of TAA, thus highlighting a pressing need for better
understanding TAA formation and progression. Aorta is naturally surrounded by perivascular adipose tissue
(PVAT). Recent large-scale epidemiological studies demonstrated that PVAT was highly associated with a
significantly higher adjusted risk of all-cause cardiac mortality. We and others documented that brown-like
PVAT contributes to vascular homeostasis in health, while whitening of PVAT is dysfunctional and contributes
to development of the vascular diseases. A causal relationship between PVAT and TAA and the underlying
mechanisms remain unknown. Our preliminary studies indicate that the PVAT near the TAA lesion in patients
lost brown characteristics, and that TAA formation was dramatically increased in mice that lack normal PVAT,
suggesting that dysfunctional PVAT is associated with TAA. The conditioned medium from PVAT of TAA
patients induced apoptosis and inflammation in human aortic smooth muscle cells, suggesting that signaling
from PVAT can cause loss of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) in the aorta, which may promote TAA
lesion. It is unknown whether browning of PVAT could protect against TAA. PR-domain containing 16
(PRDM16) is a determinant of browning gene programs. We show that PRDM16 expression in PVAT of TAA
patients is significantly reduced when compared to that in normal PVAT. PRDM16 inhibited resistin expression
in PVAT. We found that nitrated conjugated linoleic acid (NO2-CLA) induced the browning of human PVAT
adipocytes by mediating PRDM16 signaling. Based on these data, we hypothesize that PRDM16-mediated
PVAT browning prevents TAA formation. We will determine that 1) PRDM16 in PVAT prevents and reverses
TAA in mice; 2) PRDM16 inhibits TAA by regulating PVAT crosstalk with VSMC; 3) NO2-CLA prevents TAA by
targeting PRDM16. Outcomes will demonstrate that a previously unrecognized process involving loss of
browning features in PVAT promotes TAA formation through crosstalk to VSMC. This work will accelerate
clinical translation of a nitro-fatty acid-based treatment for TAA targeting PVAT homeostasis with this new
class of drugs, currently on clinical trials for other diseases."

Successful reproductive function depends on the proper activation of the gonadotropic axis and
the development of adequate sexual behavior. While the hypothalamic mechanisms regulating
gonadotropin release have been extensively studied, those regulating sexual behavior and
specifically those connecting behavior and fertility have remained elusive. The amygdala has
been documented to integrate sexual cues, e.g. pheromones, to elicit sexual behavior and lesion
studies have indicated its relevance for proper GnRH release in both sexes. Interestingly, the
hypothalamic neuropeptide, kisspeptin (Kiss1), critical for reproductive function, has also been
identified in the amygdala. Our preliminary data documents that the activation of Kiss1 neurons
in the medial amygdala (MeAKiss1 neurons) stimulates LH release. Therefore, our overarching
aim is to characterize in detail the role of MeAKiss1 neurons in males and females in the control of
gonadotropin release and sexual behavior through a combination of functional, pharmacological
and genetic studies that will include: 1) optogenetic and chemogenetic manipulation of cre-
expressing neurons in Kiss1-cre mice; 2) ablation of MeAKiss1 neurons using cre-dependent,
apoptosis inducing, Casp3 viruses; and 3) track tracing of projections from MeAKiss1 neurons to
hypothalamic neurons using fiber markers (mCherry), mono-synaptic track tracers and calcium
photometry circuit mapping. Moreover, we will characterize the interaction between these two
functions (i.e. gonadotropin release and sexual behavior) by assessing the activation of Kiss1 and
GnRH neurons during mating, and the activation of hypothalamic nuclei involved in sexual
behavior during the LH surge in females. Overall, the successful completion of this project will
significantly extend our understanding of the role of the medial amygdala in the integration of
sexual behavior and gonadotropin release, which is fundamental to synchronize mating and
ovulation for successful reproduction. The expected findings will offer new platforms for the
treatment of reproductive disorders of central origin such as hypogonadism or low sex drive."

Our objective is to develop tools that improve early diagnosis of systemic light-chain (AL) amyloidosis, a disease
that causes heart and kidney failure and early death, in patients with smoldering multiple myeloma, a disease in
which patients make immunoglobulin free light chains but are relatively asymptomatic. Based on a retrospective
study in members of the US Armed Forces who developed AL, there is a 10 to 15 year precursor period prior to
patients presenting at a median age of 63 with symptoms of AL due to toxic free light chains (FLC) and amyloid
deposits. In similar studies of patients with smoldering myeloma we know that 2% of them develop AL, meaning
that 2% have FLC that are markedly abnormal. Over half of new AL patients present with heart involvement and
it is the failure to diagnose early that underlies their 20% mortality within 6 months. In this application, we seek
support to screen patients with smoldering multiple myeloma for undiagnosed AL and risk of AL using a series
of criteria that will increase our knowledge of the likelihood of having undiagnosed AL or of being at risk for AL.
Only efforts to diagnose AL and determine risk of AL in the precursor phase of the disease will reduce the early
mortality rate. Our goal is to develop a likelihood algorithm for undiagnosed AL and risk of AL in smoldering
myeloma patients and our aims in this application are to create a network to enroll 340 patients with smoldering
multiple myeloma (SMM) on a collaborative study requiring marrow and blood specimens and collection of data
for a training set of likelihood statistics and to plan the future validation study and to validate an next generation
sequence (NGS) assay that identifies IGVL genes in clonal plasma cells. The clonal κ and λ IGVL genes in AL
cases are restricted AL-related sets of genes. The likelihood algorithm will employ 5 parameters: (1) the presence
of SMM; (2) a difference between involved (pathologic) and uninvolved FLC > 23mg/L; (3) clonal plasma cell
cytogenetics showing t(11;14) or gain 1q, (4) AL-related κ or λ IGVL genes by NGS, and (5) NT-proBNP >
332pg/mL. All subjects will have their clonal IGVL genes identified by NGS enabling the creation and validation
of a laboratory developed test in a precision medicine laboratory that is certified under regulations of the Clinical
Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA). Our long-term goal is to overcome the current inability in
patients with SMM to effectively assess for the presence of occult AL or to estimate the likelihood of developing
AL. By determining the values of the 5 parameters we will create the training set for an algorithm to estimate the
likelihood of having or progressing to AL and will be able to design the validation study. We have assembled a
collaborative team of investigators at centers across the USA to pursue our aims and an expert support group
to address the opportunities, challenges and patient care issues that will arise. We have put together a team of
expert collaborators from over a dozen academic centers and expert consultants in myeloma, AL amyloidosis,
molecular biology and protein biology, in order to pursue these aims, realizing the complexity of the endeavor
and the demands of each aim."
10805451,"ABSTRACT
Given the aging of the population, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major public health issue. Because of the lack
of effective interventions to date, there is a need to identify new treatments. Emerging evidence has shown that
AD involves multiple pathological mechanisms, with combinations of various forms of vascular and AD pathology.
 The renin angiotensin system (RAS) plays a key role in blood pressure (BP) regulation and there is
growing evidence about its likely involvement in the pathogenesis of AD, potentially through BP control and
associated improvement of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and vascular endothelial function, but also through other
mechanisms, including antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects, in addition to modulation of amyloid and tau
metabolism. There are very few studies, including our studies, evaluating the role of RAS in cognitively normal
at-risk population to evaluate associations between RAS peptides, structural brain changes and cognitive
function, and none following participants over long period of time. In this study we propose to extend our
previous research in cognitively normal participants
who are obese with T2DM, thus at increased risk
for AD
, from Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) study by measuring RAS peptides to elucidate
the underlying mechanism by which the RAS may be involved in structural brain changes affecting
cognitive function over an 9-14-year period. The Look AHEAD study was a randomized clinical trial of a
lifestyle intervention that is now in an observational phase. Look AHEAD is ideal for the proposed study because
of the high prevalence of vascular risk factors (diabetes mellitus, obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia) as well as
1) stored blood samples and 2) ancillary studies with detailed measures of cognitive function and structural MRI
imaging available. Our aims are to examine 1) change of blood RAS peptide and enzyme levels (ACE-1, ACE-
2, ANGII, ANGIII and ANG1-7) over time (collected at years 1 and 4); 2) associations between blood RAS
enzyme and peptide levels and
brain MRI structural measures related to AD signature regions and vascular
measures
(collected once through years 9-11); and 3) associations between blood RAS enzymes and peptide
levels and global and domain specific cognitive measures (collected longitudinally through years 8-14).
In this proposal we aim to elucidate the role of RAS during aging to understand its contribution in the development
of AD using cross-disciplinary approach. The results of this study will help understand the relationship between
RAS and brain biomarkers and guide future research to examine whether changes in these peptides could serve
as predictors of cognitive decline and/or cognitive impairment."
10802247,"Local sleep and mental fatigue
PROJECT SUMMARY
Mental fatigue—a feeling of exhaustion often accompanied by the sense that every task requires great effort—is prevalent in
neurological and psychiatric diseases. In healthy subjects, it is a common symptom ensuing after intense learning or sleep
deprivation. Mental fatigue is also frequent when sleep is poor and can be relieved by improving sleep quality. Moreover, the
broad cognitive impairment that accompanies mental fatigue is resolved by sleeping but not by resting while awake. Despite
the evidence linking mental fatigue with brain dysfunctions and sleep deficits, the reasons why the brain gets “tired” remain
unknown. This proposal tests a novel, circuit-level hypothesis about the neural mechanisms of mental fatigue caused by sleep
loss or intense learning. In these cases, we hypothesize that a key underlying mechanism is the increasing occurrence, within
corticothalamic networks, of local neuronal OFF periods in wake, triggered by the activation of Martinotti cells (MaCs). In
NIH-funded groundwork that led to this hypothesis we demonstrated, in both rodents and humans, that sleep deprivation leads
to “local sleep” in wake: even though the rest of the brain is awake, local groups of cortical neurons briefly stop firing (OFF
periods), as they usually only do, in a widespread manner, during sleep slow waves. Even though subjects are behaviorally
awake, if “local sleep” occurs in cortical areas involved in task execution, performance is impaired. In further work, we
demonstrated that the widespread OFF periods underlying the slow waves of sleep are promoted by the activation of MaCs,
which are somatostatin-positive (SOM+) GABAergic neurons found throughout cortex. Once recruited by strong excitatory
inputs from pyramidal neurons, MaCs can act as master regulators of cortical excitability by inhibiting all other cell types.
Finally, we found that extended wake and intense learning lead to increased neuronal excitability due to the progressive
strengthening of cortical glutamatergic connections, which are renormalized (weakened) by sleep and not simply by rest.
Guided by these findings and preliminary data, we propose that a key mechanism underlying mental fatigue is the increased
excitability of MaCs and their maladaptive triggering of OFF periods during wake. To test this hypothesis, we will perform
high-density Neuropixels recordings in mice and rats in multiple cortical and subcortical areas. These recordings will be
combined with optogenetic tagging to determine, first, whether extended wake or intense learning will activate MaCs and
trigger local OFF periods in wake. Guided by a new large-scale sleep/wake model of corticothalamic circuits, we will then
test two key predictions in vivo. Using opto/chemogenetics, we will determine whether, after extended wake or intense
learning, local OFF periods in wake are prevented by silencing MaCs and, conversely, whether they are triggered by the
activation of MaCs even in fully rested animals. If successful, we will uncover: 1) a candidate circuit mediating mental fatigue
after extended wake and intense learning; 2) a key mechanism through which fatigue is mediated—the induction of OFF
periods in corticothalamic networks due to the progressive build-up of synaptic strength in wake. Exploratory analysis of unit
data collected in thalamic, striatal, and hippocampal areas will also determine whether local sleep extends subcortically,
potentially contributing to the impairment in performance and motivation associated with mental fatigue."

Despite the universal use and success of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), more than 30% of people
living with human immunodeficiency virus infection (PLWHIV) in the US are suffering from depression.
Although accumulating evidence suggests that sustained systemic and CNS inflammation are commonly
observed in patients with major depressive disorder and PLWHIV, the pathophysiology underlying depression
among PLWHIV remain poorly investigated. In this K01 proposal, the candidate hypothesizes that there is a
crosstalk between the gut bacterial and fungal communities, which if disrupted, may lead to sustained
inflammation and depressive-like phenotypes in the EcoHIV mouse model. The candidate also hypothesizes
that pachyman, a natural product of 1,3-D-β-glucan, can rescue the EcoHIV-induced depressive-like
behaviors, gut bacterial-fungal dysbiosis, and sustained inflammation, based on the preliminary results
showing that pachyman has an antidepressant effect which is dependent on inhibition of Dectin-1, a pattern-
recognition β-D-Glucan receptor. To test the hypothesis, three specific aims are proposed: (1) To identify and
phenotypically characterize the nature of HIV-induced depressive-like behaviors in the EcoHIV mouse model.
(2) To identify and study HIV-induced alterations in gut microbiota in conjunction with inflammatory signaling in
the gut, circulation and in the central nervous system. (3) To determine whether pachyman treatment
ameliorates HIV-induced depressive-like behaviors, and modulates gut microbiota and inflammatory signaling
via dectin-1 inhibition. To achieve the 3 specific aims, 4 short-time training steps/goals are required: (i) To
become proficient at the study of social behavior phenotypes and immune characteristics of HIV mice models--
the candidate will be mentored by Drs. Atsushi Kamiya, Barbara Slusher, and Amanda Brown, with
Consultancy/collaboration with Drs. David Volsky and Norman Haughey. Training will occur at Johns
Hopkins. (ii) To successfully conduct 16S and ITS2 targeted Metagenomic sequencing profiling, perform
accurate biostatics analyses, and correctly interpret and synthesize biological meaning from gut microbiota
datasets--the candidate will be trained by Drs. Robert Yolken and Sarah Wheelan at Johns Hopkins. (iii) To
receive basic science hands-on training as well as didactic training in the pharmacology of natural products
and drug development by Dr. Slusher. (iv) To receive knowledge and skills training in epidemiology, clinical
manifestations, biomarkers selection, translational therapeutics, and research methodology for depression in
PLWHIV by Dr. Justin McArthur. Above all, the long-term goal of this K01 proposal is to develop an
independent research laboratory equipped to independently study the treatment effects of natural products on
gut bacterial-fungal dysbiosis-induced inflammatory mechanisms in HIV-associated neuropsychiatric disorders,
and to develop a programmatic line of research by successfully competing for funding."
10802517,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Animals desire sugars for their energy potential and for the pleasurable sensation of tasting sweetness. Despite
the importance of sugar receptors in influencing nutrient sensing, metabolic responses, and taste perception,
few studies have been performed to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying sugar detection and
recognition. The proposed project will address this gap by integrating structural and functional studies to offer a
unique perspective on the biophysical basis for sweet taste. In the first two Aims, we will focus on a single
exemplary GR, Gr9 from the silk moth Bombyx mori, and couple structural methods with mutagenesis and
functional assays to understand why it can only be activated by a single type of sugar, D-fructose. In Aim 1, we
will investigate how this receptor binds D-fructose, how binding is coupled to the channel gate, and how different
subunits within the tetramer interact cooperatively to open the ion-conducting pore. In Aim 2, we will investigate
why other similarly sized sugars bind but do not activate the channel. In Aim 3, we will expand our analysis to
other GRs that are activated by different sweet compounds to resolve the relationship between receptor
sequence and ligand specificity. Our structural and functional analyses of GRs will provide a crucial foundation
to understand how different tastants are recognized by a diverse collection of receptors and present novel routes
for the design and optimization of small molecules that interfere with the gustatory systems of insect vectors of
human pathogens."
10805088,"Even though schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD) are generally considered to be neurodevelopmental in
origin, emerging evidence supports the idea that aberrant brain aging may also occur. Because this concept has
only recently reemerged, data on characteristic phenotypical and brain age-related trajectories in SSD and their
underlying mechanisms remain sparse. These critical knowledge gaps constitute major obstacles in identifying
actionable treatment targets for aberrant aging in SSD. Our proposal has two overarching goals: (1) address
existing knowledge gaps in age-related changes in SSD and (2) identify actionable targets for novel interventions
designed to ameliorate, or even prevent, aberrant aging in SSD.
A considerable body of work in geroscience suggests that normal aging phenomena are present at multiple
levels. Specifically, age-related declines in brain structures and cognitive function are well established. Recent
findings also suggest that energy metabolism (bioenergetics) in the brain, which is critical for brain plasticity and
cognition, is negatively affected by aging. Emerging data further supports the idea that these phenomena are
intricately connected and point towards bioenergetic aging as a potentially driving force behind structural brain
aging and cognitive aging. These principles of aging in the general population provide the conceptual framework
of our project.
We propose to leverage state-of-the-art multimodal neuroimaging techniques and tailored cognitive tasks to
systematically evaluate age-related changes in brain structure, function, and bioenergetics in the dorsal anterior
cingulate cortex (dACC), which is considered a hallmark brain region implicated in the pathophysiology of SSD
and plays a critical role in nonsocial and social cognition. Over a period of 5 years, we will enroll 120 individuals
with SSD and 120 demographically matched controls. We will quantify (1) cortical thickness deviations in the
dACC using novel normative reference models, (2) social cognition and nonsocial cognition with a tailored
behavioral battery and task fMRI, and (3) in vivo spectroscopic indices of bioenergetics in the dorsal ACC (dACC)
using ultra-high-field MR spectroscopy (MRS). We will determine if these measures of patients differ from those
of healthy volunteers (Aim 1) and if the effect of age on these measures differs between patients and controls
(Aim 2). We will also explore whether age trajectories converge across measures in an exploratory aim.
The findings of this project could offer mechanistic insights into aging process in SSD by focusing on multiple
units of analysis and provide actionable treatment targets for aberrant aging in SSD."
10933512,"Advanced age is a major risk factor for many chronic diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Despite
substantial research progress, most treatments currently available merely mitigate symptoms. Given that most
of patients with dementia due to AD are sporadic, and in those, aging is the key risk factor for this late-onset AD,
targeting the mechanisms that have been collectively summarized as “hallmarks of aging” may provide avenues
for development of new therapeutic approaches. Emerging evidence links aging and age-related
neurodegenerative diseases to disruption in RNA alterations, specifically N6-methyladenosine (m6A)
modification. m6A RNA is the most prevalent and abundant modification of RNA in eukaryotes, with high
expression specifically in the brain. Recently, m6A RNA has been shown to regulate stability of R-loops; three-
nucleic acid structures, consisting of an RNA-DNA hybrid and a ssDNA that form during transcription.
In this proposal we will examine the role of m6A epi-transcriptomic modification in R-loop-driven pathophysiology
of AD. Using Drosophila AD model, in aim 1 we will elucidate how m6A RNA impairment impacts R-loop
distribution across the genome and formation of RNA-DNA hybrids in cytoplasm, and their impact on
transcriptional stress and activation of chronic immune response in AD. The significance of aim 2 is in identifying
the regulatory mechanisms of R-loop-dependent DSB formation in AD. While variety of exogenous factors can
contribute to DNA damage, we will define a role of R-loops in genome instability associated with AD. Moreover,
we will define the epigenetic modifications associated with formation of stable R-loops resistant to resolution,
which are alternatively processed into DSBs. In aim 3, we will expand our studies from Drosophila to mammalian
system. Using in vitro rat cortical neuron cultures seeded with human brain tau, we will further elucidate the
molecular mechanisms of R-loop associated genome instability and neuroinflammation in AD. Neurons have
specialized RNA metabolism and it is therefore not surprising that dysfunction in RNA metabolism is strongly
associated with neurological diseases.
This proposal focuses on a novel possibility that defects in RNA metabolism, and particularly R-loop
homeostasis, is a significant driver of transcriptional stress, genome instability, and chronic immune response;
key hallmarks of aging, whose acceleration may lead to neurodegeneration."

CANDIDATE: I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC).
During my Ph.D. studies, I dedicated myself to developing biology-based mathematical models of bacterial
metabolism. My current research extends my interest from single organisms to microbial communities, with a
particular focus on the human intestinal microbiome. Since joining MSKCC, I have compiled a large
longitudinal microbiome dataset from hospitalized patients who have undergone allogeneic hematopoietic cell
transplantation (allo-HCT). I have also acquired bioinformatic skills and data-driven modeling techniques to
profile microbiome compositions and quantify their associations with clinical outcomes. Built upon this dataset,
my proposed research aligns well with my long-term career goal of establishing an independent laboratory to
elucidate mechanistic links between the intestinal microbiota and infectious diseases. To prepare for my
transition to independence and developing a competitive computational research program, I have developed a
focused career plan to enhance my computational skills in metagenomic/metabolomic data analyses,
community metabolic modeling, and development of neural network models. In parallel, I will improve my soft
skills, including presentation, networking, grantsmanship, mentorship, leadership, and teaching.
RESEARCH: Immunocompromised patients undergoing intensive antimicrobial therapy are at high risk for
developing invasive fungal bloodstream infections (BSIs). Between 2016 and 2020, C. parapsilosis was
responsible for the most breakthrough BSI cases among allo-HCT recipients at MSKCC. Typically, C.
parapsilosis BSI occurs subsequent to its intestinal expansion. This proposal will leverage my mathematical
modeling expertise and the vast microbiome dataset of our allo-HCT cohort to elucidate the ecological
mechanisms underlying intestinal expansion of C. parapsilosis. My central hypothesis is that altered intestinal
metabolic environment enables C. parapsilosis expansion. Specific Aim 1 will identify bacterial secreted
metabolites that inhibit C. parasilosis. In Specific Aim 2, I will investigate the impacts of genomic variations
across different C. parapsilosis isolates on their ability to utilize nutrients and grow in the human intestine. The
Specific Aim 3 will involve building a machine-learning-powered computational framework for the risk
assessment of C. parapsilosis expansion and the rational design of antifungal therapy to reduce the risk.
ENVIRONMENT: I will complete the K99 phase of this grant in the Computational & Systems Biology Program
at MSKCC, a state-of-the-art cancer research institute. My primary mentor, Dr. Joao Xavier, has a proven track
record in mathematical modeling of bacterial microbiomes, while my co-mentor, Dr. Tobias Hohl, is an expert in
fungal mycobiomes and infectious disease. The two labs will jointly provide a rich and complementary training
and research environment that integrates computational, experimental, and clinical resources."

 The number of physician-scientists in the United States has decreased from its peak of 5% in 1980 to
1.5% today. This decline particularly threatens Pediatrics and child health research where only 12.6% of all
MD/PhD program graduates choose residency training in Pediatrics and in Internal Medicine, while 40% of U.S.
MD/PhD graduates enter Internal Medicine residency programs, these trainees only account for 3.6% of all
Internal Medicine trainees. Together, these data represent a critical need, and opportunity, for new and sustained
efforts to reinvigorate the physician-scientist pipeline infectious diseases, allergy and immunologic diseases. The
Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai is well poised to answer this call for novel on-ramps into the Physician-
Scientist Pathway during residency given its established infrastructure for Research Tracks in Residency which
successfully track accomplished researchers to academic research-focused fellowships and are synergistic with
this proposal. The opportunity to cultivate opportunities for research during residency is ideally suited to our
robust translational research programs. Our excellence in biomedical research across the basic, clinical, and
translational spectrum, along with the ability to individualize and adapt to each physician-scientist trainee, makes
our environment an ideal place to train future physician-scientists. The Mount Sinai Stimulating Access to
Research in Residency (StARR) is a new program to enhance physician-scientist research training opportunities
related to the mission of the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI). Mount Sinai StARR will provide
Internal Medicine and Pediatrics residents an entrez into the physician-scientist pipeline, especially focused on
underrepresented minorities and residents with a passion for inquiry but who may not have had extensive
research experience i.e. the “late bloomers”. The program will provide a stepwise introduction to investigative
research to recruit resident trainees and will be an attractive recruiting tool across and outside the Mount Sinai
Health System that will build an immersive individualized research experience with the goal of accelerating and
retaining research independence for resident investigators."

 Heart failure (HF) is associated with a 5-year mortality of 50% and the incidence is still rising with most
cases associated with ischemic cardiomyopathy. Identifying novel strategies to counteract cardiac pathological
remodeling post myocardial infarction (MI) is of urgent clinical need. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) have
recently emerged as regulators of cardiac development and disease. However, the function of most lncRNAs
remains unknown.
 We have characterized the first cardiac specific circadian lncRNA Circa, which affects cardiac remodeling
post MI through regulating alternative splicing. To better understand the molecular mechanisms of Circa and its
partner proteins in the heart, we propose the following specific aims: 1. Identify the RNA structures that are
required for Circa nuclear localization and interaction with spliceosome. We will use the state-of-the-art chemical
probing technique to define the secondary structure of Circa, then use structure mutants to identify its functional
motifs. 2. Determine whether Circa acts in trans and whether its function is dependent on its oscillatory
expression. We will unambiguously determine Circa function as a transcript by a series of “rescue” experiments
in the novel knock out mice we created. Time restricted expression will be used to test the necessity of the
oscillatory expression. 3. Define the molecular basis by which Circa affects splicing in the heart. Our preliminary
data suggests Circa may suppress splicing regulator hnRNPA1. We will test the functional interaction between
Circa and hnRNPA1 using a cardiac target gene we identified. We will further investigate the role of hnRNAPA1
in the post MI remodeling by identifying its splicing targets using eCLIPseq/RNAseq and test the function of
hnRNPA1 in vitro and in vivo. Completion of this proposal will have significant impact in understanding splicing
regulation in the heart during post MI pathological remodeling and potentially expand our therapeutic strategies
for HF treatment."
10815801,"ABSTRACT
 Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis virus (VEEV) is a life-threatening, NIH/NIAID category B human pathogen
and a potential bioterrorism threat. Outbreaks of VEEV occur in Central America and have previously spread
into the United States. The potentially devastating effects of VEEV reemergence in the U.S. demand an
effective vaccine to protect immunologically naïve population. Currently, live attenuated TC-83 vaccine is used
under IND protocol for vaccination of medical personnel at risk. The vaccine causes adverse effects, and
efforts to develop an improved VEEV vaccine are underway. However, because vaccine development is a
lengthy process and the supply of TC-83 vaccine is limited, the U.S. may soon experience a shortage of the
VEEV vaccine. This can leave the U.S. population and at-risk personnel unprotected. Furthermore, in the
absence of a vaccine, VEEV may fit the CDC definition of a BSL4 Select Agent.
 During previous NIH-supported research, Medigen evaluated a new platform technology for the
development of vaccines against VEEV and, potentially, other viral diseases. The proposed V4020 vaccine
includes attenuating rearrangement of the capsid and glycoprotein genes within the full-length genomic RNA.
The attenuating rearrangement effectively prevents reversion because many independent mutations would be
needed to revert to the pathogenic genotype. In addition, vaccine is made from a DNA copy of the rearranged
RNA genome placed in the iDNA® infectious clone downstream from the CMV promoter. The key feature of
iDNA infectious clone (and the difference from standard cDNA clone) is that live attenuated virus is launched
from the plasmid, without the need for in vitro transcription. The use of genetically stable iDNA improves
vaccine safety. In preliminary research, the V4020 virus containing rearranged genomic RNA and prepared
from iDNA clone showed safety advantages and protection against VEEV challenges in BALB/c mice and in a
cynomolgus macaque non-human primate (NHP) model.
 Specific Aim 1. Safety of V4020 live-attenuated VEEV vaccine in human subjects. Medigen in collaboration
with U.S. Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious diseases (USAMRIID), to conduct Phase 1a, first-in-
human study evaluating safety of V4020 VEEV vaccine in healthy adults. We propose a double blinded,
placebo controlled, single-dose escalation study in 39 healthy adults, 18-50 years of age. Medigen will
manufacture cGMP lot of V4020 vaccine and communicate with the FDA regarding clinical trial design. Groups
of volunteers (13 subjects/group) will receive a single 104, 105, or 106 PFU dose of V4020 vaccine (10/group),
with 3 subjects from each group randomized to receive placebo. The low dose will be administered first, and
there will be at least 14 days delay before another group will start receiving the higher dose of vaccine. The
study is designed to assess the safety of V4020 vaccine administered by subcutaneous (SC) administration.
 Specific Aim 2. Evaluate immune responses from human subjects vaccinated with V4020. In this aim, we
will evaluate clinical samples (plasma, saliva, urine) to be collected during the clinical study to identify a dosing
regimen that provides a multi-faceted immune response (neutralizing antibody, T-cell response, cytokines,
etc). Putative early signatures will be identified that could be used to predict later immunogenicity and obtain
insight into mechanisms of V4020 immunogenicity in human subjects.
 Our preliminary data suggest that the rational design, attenuating rearrangement, and iDNA technology can
provide a safe and effective solution for V4020 VEEV vaccine by improving safety, genetic stability, and
immunogenicity. Furthermore, the attenuating rearrangement can be easily adapted for the development of
other vaccines including preparation of live attenuated vaccines for WEEV, EEEV, other alphaviruses, and
other RNA viruses. If successful, this technology can potentially transform the field of live attenuated vaccines
for many viral diseases."
10815805,"CAS is a complex, multivariate speech motor disorder characterized by difficulty planning and programming
movements of the speech articulators. Despite the profound impact that CAS can have on a child’s ability to
communicate, there is a paucity of treatment research involving this population. The planned research is a
Phase II Randomized Control Trial designed to examine the outcomes of Dynamic Temporal and Tactile Cuing
(DTTC), a dynamic, multimodal approach to improving speech production, in children with childhood apraxia of
speech (CAS). The long-term goal is to provide evidence based guidelines for treatment in children with CAS.
The overall objectives of this application, which will be the largest randomized control trial on CAS to date, are
(i) to test the efficacy of DTTC in 72 young children with CAS by examining the impact of DTTC on treated
words, generalization to untreated words and post-treatment maintenance, and (ii) to examine how individual
patterns of speech motor variability impact response to DTTC. The central hypothesis is that DTTC will refine
speech motor control and lead to longstanding change in speech production accuracy. The rationale for this
work is that research on the efficacy of DTTC will provide a strong scientific foundation for future treatment
research on CAS whereby Phase III studies can be conducted. It will also enhance our theoretical
understanding of speech motor learning in this underserved population. The central hypothesis will be tested
by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Quantify the effects of DTTC on improved speech production (perceptual
ratings) in treated words that are maintained post-treatment and generalized to untreated words in children
with CAS; 2) Quantify the effects of DTTC on refined speech motor control (kinematic/acoustic measures) in
treated words that are maintained post-treatment and generalized to untreated words in children with CAS; and
3) Characterize the effects of speech motor variability (within-subject) at baseline as a predictor of DTTC
efficacy in children with CAS. The first aim will be studied by documenting the accuracy and intelligibility of
treated words, maintenance post-treatment and generalization to untreated words. The second aim will be
studied by measuring the duration and variability of treated words, maintenance post-treatment and
generalization to untreated words. For aim three, measures of speech motor variability at baseline will be
compared to word accuracy and intelligibility post-treatment. The proposed work is innovative, as it will study
the efficacy of a motor-based treatment for CAS (DTTC) in a large sample of young children, use objective
measures (kinematic & acoustic) to support evidence-based decision-making and provide new evidence about
participant factors that predict response to treatment. These contributions will be significant because they are
expected to have a substantial impact on clinical practice by provide strong scientific justification for continued
motor based treatment research for children with CAS. There is important"

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and affects approximately 50 million
people worldwide. Although significant resources have been invested, successful therapies have yet to
be discovered, suggesting that alternative approaches may be needed. This proposal will investigate a
new idea connecting modifications spontaneously occurring in long-lived proteins to the underlying
causes of AD. These modifications, known as isomerization and epimerization, represent structural
changes that significantly perturb the behavior of affected proteins. These modifications have largely
escaped prior investigation because they have historically been difficult to detect, but recent advances
in technology have enabled their identification and characterization on a larger scale than previously
possible. We will use these methods to fully characterize these modifications in a protein called tau and
the amyloid beta peptide, which are both intricately involved in the progression of AD. We will also
explore the underlying chemistry leading to the formation of isomerization and epimerization and the
rates at which they accrue. Importantly, we hypothesize that these modifications prevent long-lived
proteins from being broken down and recycled in the lysosome. This hypothesis is supported by
preliminary results and, importantly, provides a pathway that could eventually explain the lysosomal
malfunction that is known to occur in AD and is among the earliest observable problems at the cellular
level. We will perform experiments to determine whether any of the lysosomal proteases, the molecules
responsible for degrading proteins, are able to digest the modified proteins. Undigested protein
fragments persisting in the lysosome due to isomerization or epimerization would be subject to
accumulation. This failure closely parallels events occurring with undigested substrates in lysosomal
storage disorders and provides a potential explanation for the previously observed connections
between the two diseases, which exhibit similar pathology. The ultimate goal of this project is to
establish that modifications to long-lived proteins initiate events that ultimately lead to lysosomal failure
in AD, which will open up new therapeutic strategies for exploration."

10817251,"Project Summary
Long-standing hypotheses have posited a critical role for dysregulated dopaminergic neuromodulation of
prefrontal cortex in the development of alcohol use disorder (AUD). Despite intense interest in the mesocortical
dopamine system, technical challenges have precluded direct, temporally resolved observation of dopamine
release patterns in the prefrontal cortex until recently. Accordingly, questions regarding the basic function of
mesocortical dopamine as well as its role in AUD have been notoriously difficult to address. Here we propose to
use a recently developed genetically-encoded fluorescent dopamine sensor, which allows for direct assessment
of dopamine dynamics in vivo with unprecedented specificity and temporal resolution, to dissect dopamine
release patterns in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) associated with alcohol self-administration behaviors.
In male and female mice, we will first test the responsiveness of dopamine innervation of mPFC to a range of
stimuli including alcohol to determine its contribution to basic behavioral processes. Next we will assess how
these release patterns evolve during initiation of alcohol self-administration and repeated alcohol exposure to
determine if deficits in this system are associated with the emergence of heightened alcohol drinking and
seeking. Finally, we will mechanistically investigate mesocortical control of alcohol drinking behaviors by
manipulating the activity of this system in vivo and determine alcohol’s direct actions on presynaptic dopamine
terminals in the mPFC using ex vivo imaging. Completion of this proposal will provide unprecedented insight and
understanding as to the contribution of dysregulated cortical neuromodulation in AUD-relevant behaviors."

initiate the expression of interferons and cytokine genes, resulting in airway inflammation and
induction of anti-viral immunity. This R01 application is based on our serendipitous discovery that the
serine/threonine kinase protein kinase D (PKD) has a previously overlooked role in innate immune
responses driven by the dsRNA polyI:C. There are three PKD isoforms (PKD1-3), but little is known
about their expression or function in the lung. Using targeted siRNA knock-down and a new line of
knock-out mice, we found that polyI:C-induced epithelial cytokine gene expression and neutrophil
recruitment to the lung are both dependent on PKD3. This appears to involve a previously unreported
role for PKD3 in polyI:C signaling in epithelial cells, as well as in chemokine receptor signal
transduction in neutrophils. Excitingly, we also discovered that a potent and selective PKD antagonist
protects mice from infection with influenza A virus (IAV). In this revised R01 application, we propose
three Aims that will: explain exactly how PKD mediates dsRNA signal transduction in airway epithelial
cells (Aim 1), use conditional deletion and other strategies to unravel a new neutrophil specific role for
PKD3 in lung inflammation (Aim 2), and test the hypothesis that targeting PKD will attenuate lung
inflammation after influenza infection in mice (Aim 3)."

p53 tumor suppressor is frequently mutated in cancer, and mutant p53 is an oncogene. Upon exposure
to a stress signal, such as DNA damage, p53 transcription factor is activated and then induces an array of
pro-survival and pro-death genes. Among these is Rbm38, a RNA-binding protein. Interestingly, we
showed that Rbm38 represses p53 mRNA translation by preventing eIF4E from binding to p53 m7G cap.
Thus, p53 and Rbm38 constitutes a feedback loop. To determine the significance of the p53-Rbm38
loop, we showed that:(1) phosphorylation of serine-195 and substitution of S195 with aspartic acid
(S195D) prevent Rbm38 from interacting with eIF4E, which converts Rbm38 from a repressor to an
activator of p53 translation; (2) an 8-aa peptide derived from Rbm38 (Pep8: YPYAAS195PA) and a 23-
aa peptide derived from eIF4E (Pep23: aa 195-217) are able to disrupt the Rbm38-eIF4E complex to
increase p53 expression. These observations prompt us to hypothesize that the Rbm38-eIF4E pathway,
which is regulated by S195 phosphorylation and mutations in Rbm38, plays a critical role in p53-
mediated tumor suppression. To test this, we will determine: (1) how p53-dependent tumor suppression
is regulated by the Rbm38-eIF4E pathway; (2) whether the Rbm38-eIF4E pathway can be targeted to
kill tumor cells carrying wild-type p53."

This project focuses on the biology of telomeres, the protective elements at chromosome ends whose erosion
limits the replicative lifespan of primary human cells. Telomere dysfunction has been implicated in a number of
human diseases, including inherited bone marrow failure syndromes and cancer. We aim to understand how
telomeres protect chromosome ends and how they are maintained. Insights into these issues resulted from our
studies of shelterin, the six-subunit protein complex that binds to telomeric DNA. Shelterin is anchored on
telomeres by two telomeric DNA binding proteins, TRF1 and TRF2, which promote telomere replication and
protect telomeres from the DNA damage response, respectively. This proposal focuses on these two critical
telomere factors. In AIM 1, we will critically test the leading model in the field that telomeres are protected through
the formation of the t-loop structure by TRF2. We have previously shown that TRF2 is required for t-loop
formation and our preliminary data indicates that TRF2 is sufficient to create this structure. Despite the popularity
of this model, there is no direct proof that t-loops repress the DNA damage response. We are developing
orthogonal (TRF2-independent) tools for t-loop formation and will test whether generation of t-loops is sufficient
to repress the DNA damage response in absence of TRF2. In AIM 2, we will investigate how TRF2 generates t-
loops. T-loop formation is thought to require the TRFH domain of TRF2 but how this domain acts is not clear.
Our preliminary studies of the TRFH domains of TRF2 (which forms t-loops) and TRF1 (which does not) have
identified features of the TRF2 TRFH domain with potential relevance to t-loop formation. These attributes will
be tested for their relevance to telomere protection in vivo. In AIM 3, we will study the role of the TRF2 Myb
domain in the protection of telomeres. Our preliminary data challenge the widely-held view that the TRF1/2 Myb
domains only function as DNA binding modules and suggest that they have additional functions, potentially
through protein-protein interactions. We will pursue our hypothesis, based on our preliminary data, that the Myb
domain of TRF2 mediates a critical role in telomere protection. In AIM 4, we will investigate the function of TRF1
in telomere replication. Loss of TRF1 induces fragile telomeres, replication fork stalling, and sister telomere
associations. Our preliminary data show how TRF1 uses the BLM helicase to prevent lagging-strand replication
problems, most likely caused by G4 DNA. We propose to investigate how TRF1 prevents leading-strand
replication problems, fork stalling, and sister telomere associations. We will expand on our preliminary data
indicating that the sister telomere associations represent a novel type of telomere fusion resulting from a
previously unrecognized alt-NHEJ mechanism involving stalled replication forks. This project will use innovative
approaches and our established biochemical, cell biological, and molecular genetic tools to reveal new concepts
in telomere biology with relevance to age-related human disease states."

A significant driver of success within the drug discovery process is the ability to accurately simulate diseases
through cellular models for early testing of promising therapeutics. While the use of cancer cell-based models
are typical for drug discovery, using these cells to simulate non-cancer diseases is inaccurate and can alter the
drug discovery process. Thus, scientists have been transitioning to primary cells derived from patient Induced
Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSC) for drug screening. Working with cellular models derived from iPSC involves
fixing the cells to perform immunofluorescent staining for analysis of targets of interest, which unfortunately
does not permit meaningful live-cell studies. While techniques are available for developing iPSC with genomic
modifications via CRISPR (for tracking endogenous drug targets) that allow for live-cell analysis, these
processes are highly laborious and inefficient. Here we propose developing novel genetic tools, in combination
with CRISPR for genome editing, to rapidly add reporter tags in up to three target genes in iPSC cells. This will
dramatically improve drug discovery with live-cell high-content confocal microscopy. We will use our FAST-
HDR vector system (patented), in combination with CRISPR, to enhance the process of genome editing in
iPSC cells. Our methodology is validated with cancer cell lines, and recent preliminary data indicates that our
techniques can work with iPSC. Thus the challenge presented in the current application is to adapt our
methodology to work seamlessly with iPSC cells and to create novel vectors that will facilitate the modification
of genes that are not actively expressed in the stem cell state. The results of this work will generate
breakthrough reagents and techniques that will allow other researchers to take full advantage of multiplex
genome editing of iPSC cells for advancing cell biology and drug discovery."

Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death from a single infection worldwide, with an annual death toll of
over 1.6 million lives. TB is curable and drug regimens can be above 90% effective if completed but are long and
toxic leading to noncompliance and emergence of resistance. New treatment options relying on novel and
unexplored targets are scarce. The BPaL regimen recently approved by the FDA features, for the first time in
many decades, drugs against new Mtb targets (ATP synthase) and with novel mode of action (nitroimidazoles).
Nevertheless, more inhibitors against previously unexplored targets are urgently needed to sustain the TB drug
pipeline, as resistance is already detected to components of BPaL. Both shortages, in effective antibiotics and
unexplored targets, are even more glaring in the field of non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) diseases which
are on a rise and are recognized now as an emerging global threat in both immunocompromised and
immunocompetent individuals. Mycobacterial lipoamide dehydrogenase (Lpd) represents one of the unexplored
but Mtb-validated targets and serves in at least 4 enzyme complexes in Mtb: in pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH),
-ketoacid dehydrogenase, branched chain keto-acid dehydrogenase, and peroxynitrite reductase/peroxidase.
Lpd is a genetically validated target: Mtb with lpd deleted does not survive in a mouse model of TB infection and
a conditionally regulated lpd Mtb strain is cleared in mice, when Lpd expression is suppressed in either the acute
or chronic infection. This application leverages the knowledge of the chemical biology of Mtb Lpd to explore our
newly identified tight binding inhibitors (TBI) of Mtb Lpd by structure-guided analysis, enzyme kinetics and
binding assays to define Lpd binding site features responsible for tight binding interactions and extensions of the
on-target residence time (t1/2). We aim to define what drives antibacterial activity of Lpd TBI, how t1/2 contributes
to whole cell activity and selectivity, and how we can design/predict better analogs with improved t1/2 to enable
further efficacy improvements. We will develop a framework for progression of TBIs from an isolated target to its
cellular PDH complex target and its whole cell activity against TB in culture and during host infection. Extension
of those studies to NTM pathogens and testing against Mycobacterium avium and M. abscessus Lpd orthologs
will lead to scaffold progression and SAR development of a novel whole cell active inhibitor of NTM. Collectively
our studies will explore the SAR of Lpd TBI in vitro, define vulnerability of mycobacterial Lpd to chemical inhibition
in vivo, advance our understanding of ways to improve inhibitors' efficacy through its target's t1/2, contribute to
rational prediction of in vivo efficacy and characterize structural features of mycobacterial PDH that define its
distinct macromolecular organization and sustain its functional diversity."

The RAG recombinase is a domesticated transposase that initiates V(D)J recombination and contributes
significantly to genome instability. To understand the mechanisms that protect the genome from dangerous
RAG endonuclease/transposase activity, we have taken a distinctive approach that melds evolutionary
biology with biochemistry and structural biology. From structures of ancestral RAG-like (RAGL) transposases,
we discovered RAG’s fundamental modular organization, an “on-off” switch that controls properly regulated
(“coupled”) cleavage, a novel DNA binding module that disrupts proper target site selection, and four
evolutionary adaptations in RAG that together provide powerful, multilayered protection against transposition.
These advances helped establish our current paradigm for RAG’s evolutionary origins and support a “DNA
confinement” model to explain errors in RAG targeting. Using these novel conceptual frameworks and our
recent discovery of a critical “missing link” in RAG’s evolutionary history, we will pursue our central objective:
to understand the mechanisms that ensure that RAG cuts appropriate targets in a properly orchestrated
(“coupled”) manner as well as the mechanisms that protect against catastrophic insertional mutagenesis due
to transposition into the genome. To achieve this objective, we will pursue the following aims:
Aim 1. Determine the evolutionary, structural, and biochemical basis of the RAGL→RAG transition.
We will systematically dissect the activity and structure of “missing link” RAGL transposases and rigorously
test the predictions of our DNA confinement and “on-off” switch models using in vitro protein biochemistry, a
suit of in vivo cleavage and transposition assays, cryo-electron microscopy, and chimeric RAG enzymes
engineered to possess carefully perturbed DNA binding and cleavage activities.
Aim 2. Determine the mechanisms by which RAG2 suppresses RAG-mediated transposition in vivo.
RAG2 and, surprisingly, “missing link” RAG2L proteins, possess an acidic hinge domain that powerfully
suppresses transposition, leading us to propose that RAG2L arose early in evolution as an “antitoxin” to
suppress the genotoxic potential of RAG1L (the transposase “toxin”). We will determine the protein residues
and mechanisms that mediate the suppressive activity of the acidic hinge and a second suppressive region
in RAG2, the LF2F3 loop, using an array of biochemical reconstitution and proximity labeling approaches.
Aim 3. Determine the biological and genomic consequences of hyperactivated/dysregulated RAG in
cells and mice. The goal of this aim is to connect mechanistic understanding to biological outcome. Using in
vivo transposition assays and mice harboring mutant RAG alleles, we will answer two outstanding questions:
i) Which RAG adaptations are needed to suppress RAG-mediated transposition from one site in the genome
to another? ii) What are the consequences for the genome, lymphoid development, and tumorigenesis, of
unleashing RAG-mediated transposition or of uncoupling and mistargeting RAG’s cleavage activity?"
10801644,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Glial cells of the central nervous system (CNS), such as astrocytes and microglia, are intimately involved in
tuning neural circuit activity, which is crucial in brain areas where increased activity leads aberrant behavior. The
amygdala is one such limbic brain area that encodes associations between environmental stimuli and fear, and
fires only if a threat is detected. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is the amygdala input nucleus that integrates
processed sensory information and initiates fear responses. However, pro-inflammatory signals induced in
response to recurrent environmental threats boost BLA activity and increase fear responses. Glial cells in the
amygdala are integral for inhibiting inflammatory signals that otherwise drive neural activity and fear behavior.
Yet, many pathways in glial cells that tune BLA immune responses underlying fear are unknown. This lack of
knowledge is largely due to an absence of methods that profile the mechanisms regulating cross-talk among
glial cells at high throughput. Recently, I developed a new forward genetic screening platform to profile molecules
controlling cell-cell interactions called SPEAC-seq (Systematic Perturbation of Encapsulated Associated Cells
followed by SEQuencing). SPEAC-seq permits the co-encapsulation of cell pairs from differing cell classes within
picoliter droplets (e.g., astrocytes and microglia), where prior to encapsulation one cell type expresses an
inducible state-dependent fluorescent reporter and the other cell type is randomly perturbed with an sgRNA from
a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 library. Cell pairs are encapsulated, co-cultured, and then sorted in droplets at
high throughput. Isolation of sgRNA sequences from droplets containing an activated cell permits the association
of molecular regulators with cellular states. My preliminary SPEAC-seq data uncovered amphiregulin (AREG) in
microglia as a negative regulator of pro-inflammatory NF-kB signals in astrocytes by signaling through EGFR.
Interestingly, microglia-astrocyte AREG-EGFR signals negatively regulated expression of the BLA-restricted
transcription factor ETV1 in astrocytes. In preliminary studies, I found that ETV1 drove pro-inflammatory NF-kB
signaling in astrocytes and was induced in response to chronic stress in the BLA. Chemogenetic activation of
BLA astrocytes boosted helplessness behavior following chronic stress while genetic perturbation of Areg in BLA
microglia or Egfr in BLA astrocytes exacerbated fear responses following chronic stress. Together, these data
suggest that AREG+ microglia limit the activation of NF-kB in EGFR+ astrocytes by suppressing ETV1 and
stress-induced fear behavior. In this proposal, I hypothesize that AREG+ microglia limit ETV1-driven NF-kB
activation in EGFR+ BLA astrocytes to decrease stress-induced fear behavior. In Aim 1, I will test the role of
AREG+ BLA microglia in limiting astrocyte ETV1 expression and NF-kB signals. In Aim 2, I will uncover the
transcriptional and epigenetic networks of ETV1 and its family members in BLA astrocytes by multi-omic Perturb-
seq. In Aim 3, I will determine how acute or chronic activation of ETV1+ astrocytes controls fear behavior.
IN SUM, this R01 proposal will study how an anti-inflammatory cell circuit in the BLA shapes stress-induced fear."
10802096,"Despite improvements in overall survival for most cancers, survival for patients with pancreatic
cancer remains dismally low due to the late diagnosis and rapid spreading. Understanding
pancreatic cancer initiation and progression is of great importance for the development of effective
intervention strategy. Mouse models recapitulating human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
(PDAC) have been generated through activation of oncogenic Kras combined with various genetic
mutations in different pancreatic cell types, and studies using mouse genetics suggest that both
acinar and ductal cells can give rise to PDAC, and cellular origins and specific gene mutations
may determine the precursor lesion initiation, progression, as well as molecular subtype of PDAC.
Notch signaling pathway is a master regulator of cell fate decision and differentiation critical for
pancreatic development and is dysregulated in pancreatic cancer. We recently discovered that
expression of a Notch modulator, Lunatic Fringe (Lfng), is confined to a subset of centroacinar
cells in the normal pancreas. Lfng-expressing centroacinar cells are uniquely susceptible to
oncogenic transformation and deletion of Lfng blocks tumor initiation from these cells. Lfng is
upregulated in acinar and ductal cell-derived precursor lesions, and deletion of Lfng decelerates
tumor development from these two cell types. Thus, Lfng exerts oncogenic roles in the
development of PDAC from three distinct cellular origins: centroacinar, acinar and ductal cells.
Amplification and upregulation of LFNG are noted in human PDAC and are associated with poor
survival. Therefore, we propose to dissect roles of Lfng-dependent Notch signaling in pancreatic
cancer using multiple approaches including organoid culture, lineage tracing, temporal and
lineage-specific genetic manipulations, differential gene expression analysis, as well as functional
analysis of candidate genes in human PDAC cell lines to address the following Specific Aims: 1)
determine roles of Lfng-dependent Notch signaling in pancreatic cancer development from Lfng-
expressing centroacinar cells; 2) determine roles of Lfng-dependent Notch signaling in acinar- and
ductal-derived PDAC pathogenesis; and 3) characterize Lfng-expressing pancreatic cancer cells
and identify genes differentially expressed in these cells as potential therapeutic targets.
We hope to demonstrate that Lfng is critical for the initiation and progression of pancreatic cancers
arising from different cell types of the pancreas, and that Lfng marks pancreatic cancer stem cells
thought to be responsible for drug resistance and cancer relapse. Identification of genes
downstream of Lfng-dependent Notch signaling may lead to the development of biomarkers for
targeted therapy for this particularly deadly disease."

Changes in abundance of zinc, an essential nutrient but toxic at high concentrations, necessitates
adaptive mechanisms in mycobacteria. Under zinc-rich conditions, mycobacteria synthesize
ribosomes with a set of ribosomal (r-) proteins containing the zinc-binding CXXC (C+) motif, while
zinc starvation induces paralogs of these proteins called C- (for the lack of CXXC motif) as
replacements in the 70S ribosome. Evidence of C+ to C- ribosome remodeling is reported in Mtb from
chronic lung infections in mice and humans. Clinical relevance of ribosome remodeling is supported
by greater antibiotic resistance in the C- than C+ ribosomes, highlighting the challenges in using
ribosome targeting drugs in TB therapy. Previously, we solved the structures of C+ and C- ribosomes
to decipher the mechanism of their differential antibiotic resistance. We discovered the C- ribosome
as the preferred target of mycobacterial protein Y (Mpy). Mpy is a member of highly conserved family
of bacterial protein Y, which binds to the decoding region of the ribosome, thereby hibernating non-
translating ribosomes as 70S monosomes in growth arrested cells. The structure identified two
distinct drug resistance mechanisms associated with the C- ribosome. Aminoglycoside resistance is
largely associated with the preferential binding of Mpy to the decoding center of the C- ribosome,
which directly impacts the streptomycin and kanamycin binding pockets within the C- ribosome.
Unlike aminoglycosides, tolerance to spectinamides is a direct consequence of the structural changes
in the 30S ribosomal subunit due to C+ to C- substitution of the r-protein, S14. During our investigation
of ribosome hibernation as a specific response to zinc starvation, we discovered a zinc-sensing Mpy-
recruitment factor (Mrf), that ensures Mpy recruitment to C- ribosome. The mechanism by which Mpy
is recruited to C- ribosomes, resulting in ribosome hibernation, remains unknown. In this proposal,
we will specifically focus on: a) deciphering the mechanism of Mpy recruitment to the ribosome, and
b) identifying the mechanistic basis for Mpy-dependent and -independent drug resistance in
mycobacteria expressing C- ribosomes. The findings will expand our understanding of antibiotic
tolerance associated with ribosome remodeling and hibernation in zinc-starved mycobacteria. Given
that lung environment of Mtb in humans is likely zinc-limiting, our findings will inform and improve the
therapeutic strategies for TB, possibly leading to a shorter treatment regimen."

Obesity is associated with chronic inflammation and an impaired immune response to infection from select
viruses, including influenza and SARS-CoV-2, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Many studies have
demonstrated a critical role for T cells in this setting, with primary and memory T cell responses to viral infection
impaired in mice and humans with obesity. Given the high prevalence of obesity and viral infections with influenza
and coronavirus worldwide, it is critically important to understand T cell dysfunction in obesity and identify novel
strategies to improve immune response to infection in this high-risk population. T cell function and metabolism
are closely linked, and many studies have demonstrated that changes to T cell metabolism influence T cell fate
and function. We have found that activated T cells from obese animals have an altered metabolic profile
characterized by increased glucose uptake, increased conversion of glucose to pyruvate, and increased
mitochondrial oxidation. This represents a unique cellular metabolic phenotype of glucose oxidation that is not
utilized by naive, memory, or activated T cells from lean animals and may mechanistically explain obesity-
associated T cell dysfunction. Interestingly, we found that weight loss achieved by continuous low-fat diet was
unable to improve obesity-associated inflammation, normalize T cell metabolism, or improve survival to influenza
infection in obese mice. Thus, alternative approaches to decrease obesity-associated inflammation and/or
restore T cell metabolism may be needed to improve T cell responses to viral infection in individuals with obesity.
Alternative dietary approaches using variations of time-restricted feeding such as intermittent calorie restriction,
intermittent fasting, or alternate day fasting have been shown to be beneficial to both weight loss and multiple
indices of health, including metabolic disease, inflammation, and immune response to bacterial infection. Recent
publications suggest that the immunomodulation seen following time-restricted feeding is at least partially
mediated by changes in the gut microbiome. Indeed, it is now well established that the gut microbiome of mice
and humans with obesity is different than the gut microbiome of lean animals, and it is the prevailing view that
these changes in gut microbiome in obesity drive adipose and system inflammation and thereby influence
immune cell responses. Therefore, the overall objective of this R21 proposal is to determine the effects of time-
restricted feeding on gut microbiome diversity, T cell function and metabolism, and survival to influenza infection.
We hypothesize that weight loss achieved through time-restricted feeding will alter the gut microbiome and
reduce obesity-induced inflammation, thereby restoring T cell metabolism and function, resulting in decreased
morbidity and increased survival to influenza infection. Successful completion of these studies will identify
metabolic and microbiome-related mechanisms underlying T cell dysfunction in obesity and test the impact of
alternative dietary approaches on T cell response to viral infection."

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) affects a signiﬁcant portion of the middle-aged population in the US and
has been associated with a number of health concerns including cardiovascular disease and cognitive dys-
function. The development and progression of these health consequences is believed to be related to the
severity of OSA. However, current clinical indicators of OSA severity, which include an intermittent hypoxia
pattern at the tissues and the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), fail to capture the impact of the consequences
associated with the disease. The intermittent hypoxia exposure pattern at the tissue-level, a qualitative
indicator of OSA severity, relies on pulse oximetry for measurement, which has limitations including inaccu-
racies in recording and only a generalized representation of systemic arterial oxygen hemoglobin saturation.
In addition, the AHI, a quantitative measure of OSA severity, has not been shown to be strongly correlated
to disease development in previous clinical studies. Accordingly, there is a large volume of OSA sleep study
data that needs to be re-analyzed. Therefore, to better understand the development of OSA-related con-
sequences, there is a need to assess OSA severity with a method that avoids the aforementioned clinical
limitations. This can be achieved with mathematical modeling and, in this project, we propose to develop
a model for a more detailed clinical representation of OSA. In Aim 1, the model will be constructed using
fundamental mass transfer equations to track the transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide throughout the
body. Considering the lack of patient-speciﬁc approaches in current OSA modeling literature, our model will
have the ability to use respiratory and heart rate data from polysomnography studies and will be feasible for
clinical application. Therefore, to address the limitations of current measures of intermittent hypoxia expo-
sure, the result of Aim 1 will be a presentation of blood gas concentration proﬁles at the arterial and venous
ends of various target tissues, which will allow for a quantiﬁcation of hypoxia burden. In Aim 2, the model
from Aim 1 will be used with clinical data to run a correlation analysis between predicted oxygen decreases
and patient daytime sleepiness, a potential indicator of OSA presentation, which could provide an alternative
to the AHI. Therefore, the two primary outcomes of this project will be a clinically deployable mathematical
model for OSA severity assessment and a large pool of data obtained from simulated cases of OSA and a
re-analysis of existing sleep studies, which will play an important role in improving patient care."
10791300,"ABSTRACT. In the U.S., major depressive disorder (MDD) is the most common mental disorder,
with depression prevalence approaching 20% among adolescents and young adults. Current
pharmacological treatments are unsatisfactory in that 33-55% of people suffering from MDD are
non-responsive. MDD is associated with alterations in neurotransmitter systems including
hypercholinergic tone modulated by nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and decreased
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression. nAChRs are abundant in the central
nervous system, and hypercholinergic tone, in part caused by α7-nAChR activation, is associated
with depression. Pharmacologically desensitizing α7-nAChRs improves depressive symptoms in
mice. Common serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor therapies antagonize nAChRs
non-selectivity (off target effect) and enhance BDNF levels at clinically effective doses. Excitingly,
reducing expression of programmed cell death 4 (Pdcd4) protein, a translation inhibitor, by small
interfering RNA (siRNA) delivered by a cell penetrating peptide (CPP), enhances BDNF
expression to reverse depressive-like behaviors in mice. However, caution must be taken as
CPPs interact broadly with cellular macromolecules and lipid bilayers resulting in uncontrolled
cargo delivery. To begin to combat this issue, we developed an α7-nAChR selective CPP. Our
preliminary data show that the lead CPP is not cytotoxic and can transport a fluorophore into
neuronal-like cells by an α7-nAChR dependent mechanism. These underlying findings led us to
our hypothesis that the novel lead CPP, a selective α7-nAChR antagonist, coupled with Pdcd4
siRNA may be able to achieve our important goal to help those suffering from MDD. Defining if
the lead CPP can move siRNA cargo into cells and mammalian brain will remove critical barriers
that stymie scientific and clinical MDD work, in addition to other conditions affected by α7-nAChR
dysregulation. We will pursue the aims of this proposal by comparing cell culture and in vivo
application of the lead CPP complexed with fluorophore-tagged siRNA to determine if the siRNA
can be delivered to cause a cellular effect. We will combine live-cell confocal microscopy, brain
imaging, western blot, and ELISA assays. Anticipated outcomes may also reveal potential utility
of the lead CPP as a research tool. Application funding will provide foundational support for PI
Weltzin’s progress towards becoming an independent researcher by demonstrating project
feasibility, assay advancement, preliminary data generation, and a senior-author publication."
10790790,"Significant vision problems (SVP), such as significant uncorrected refractive error, amblyopia, and
strabismus are common in school-age children and may impede learning. Vision screening, a key public health
tool to identify school-age children at risk for SVP, is mandated in 41 states, however it is not known which
currently used screening test(s) effectively identify at-risk school-age children. Timely, appropriate eye care for
children who are identified through screenings can improve quality of life, facilitate learning, and decrease the
burden of lifelong vision problems, and its attendant economic costs. Currently there is great variation in state
vision screening requirements and in approaches adopted among organizations involved in screenings. There
is a need for evidence-based school-age vision screening guidelines and policies, however this will require
much more robust data on the effectiveness of screening tests than are currently available. Effective screening
tests must have high sensitivity and specificity to accurately identify those at risk for SVP while avoiding undue
and costly over-referrals. Lay and nurse screeners also must be able to successfully administer the screening
tests to children, interpret findings and make appropriate referrals. Limitations of prior screening studies in
school-age children include: 1) examining only those referred, leaving the percentage with missed SVP
unknown; 2) evaluating only 1-2 instruments without comparing available screening approaches concurrently;
3) including a wide age range, without subgroup analysis in the school-age population; 4) small sample size
with limited range of SVP included; 4) not evaluating sensitivity to detect each type of SVP; 5) using definitions
of targeted SVP that vary and may miss visually significant refractive error in school-age children; 6) not
including newer technologies. Thus, valid full-scale, side-by-side comparisons between alternative screening
tests are vital. There is also a paucity of information on how SVP affect quality of life in school-age children.
Considering disparities in access to eye care after vision screening referral, greater understanding of the
facilitators as well as barriers for obtaining needed care after screening referral is also urgently needed.
 This proposal aims to show the feasibility of a full-scale, multi-center, multidisciplinary study to compare the
effectiveness of using traditional (visual acuity and stereoacuity) and technology-based vision screening tests
for identification of school-age children at risk for SVP and in need of an eye exam. Before conducting the full-
scale study, we must show the feasibility of enrolling children at each site, completing vision screening testing,
and collecting eye exam results. We will also refine study procedures (e.g. training, certification, testing, data
collection, data management, and analysis) and develop a Manual of Procedures and Protocol for the planned,
full-scale UG1 study. We also will seek input from key organizations involved in conducting or setting
standards for children’s vision screening to ensure that crucial questions, including equitable access to care,
will be addressed in the full-scale study. The findings will help inform future screening guidelines and policies."

In the U.S. over 150,000 patients die annually from multidrug-resistant infections, and resistant infections are
associated with over $20 billion in healthcare costs. Healthcare-associated infections (HAI) highlight the impact
of antibiotic resistance, as more than 40% of HAIs are due to antibiotic-resistant organisms. Children requiring
mechanical ventilation are at risk for developing ventilator-associated infections (VAI). VAIs are responsible for
23-53% of all HAIs among children. Up to 87% of pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) patients are treated with
antibiotics and treatment for suspected VAIs accounts for 50% of antibiotic use in the PICU. In an effort to
inform the diagnosis of VAIs, clinicians often obtain respiratory cultures from mechanically ventilated patients.
However, these cultures are obtained from a non-sterile site and more than 50% of endotracheal cultures will
grow a potentially pathogenic organism within 3 days of intubation regardless of clinical symptoms. Respiratory
cultures cannot distinguish between bacterial colonization and infection, and despite the low specificity to
indicate infection, positive cultures prompt clinicians to treat with antibiotics. Safely reducing testing, referred to
as diagnostic stewardship, is an emerging strategy to reduce testing overuse and potentially antibiotic overuse.
Recently, a novel clinical practice guideline designed at the Johns Hopkins Children’s Center to standardize
approach to respiratory cultures in critically ill children safely reduced respiratory culture use by 41%. The long-
term objective of this proposal is to develop a customizable diagnostic stewardship program that can improve
antibiotic use and prevent antibiotic resistance among vulnerable children. The specific aims are Aim 1)
evaluate whether diagnostic stewardship of respiratory cultures among mechanically ventilated children
decreases respiratory culture use and antibiotic use without leading to unintended patient harm, Aim 2) identify
barriers and facilitators to implementation of diagnostic stewardship quality improvement programs to reduce
respiratory culture use among mechanically ventilated patients in 14 pediatric intensive care units, and Aim 3)
use a Delphi method, including a panel with nationwide representation, to develop consensus
recommendations informing when to obtain respiratory cultures in mechanically ventilated children. Fourteen
hospitals participating in a multicenter quality improvement initiative, the Bright STAR Collaborative, are
implementing local quality improvement programs to improve respiratory culture use. This proposal will
evaluate the implementation of local diagnostic stewardship programs and determine whether these programs
represent an effective and safe strategy to reduce antibiotic use in a vulnerable population. The proposed aims
will assemble the tools and evidence to broadly disseminate diagnostic stewardship as a strategy to reduce
antibiotic use and deliver high value care, and catalyze similar work in non-ICU pediatric and adult populations."

 High nursing workload is a threat to care quality, patient safety, and nurses’ well-being and job satisfaction.
Workload – which lacks a universally accepted definition - is a complex multi-dimensional construct that is
affected by external task demands and environmental, organizational, and psychological factors. The
importance of managing high workload is nowhere more evident than in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs).
Critically ill neonates are highly vulnerable to iatrogenic events due to their immaturity and fragility, and high
workload has been directly associated with increased incidence of adverse neonatal safety outcomes.
 Despite the evidence and need, patient safety researchers have been slow to develop multi-level models,
scalable workload measurement systems, or other health information technology interventions to improve
workload management and patient safety. Conventional nursing workload management tools predominantly
measure and predict workload using unit-level (e.g., staffing ratios) or patient-level (e.g., acuity) data rather
than data collected across the four levels of workload recommended by human factors engineers (HFEs) - unit,
job, patient, and situation. As a result, current tools under-measure the workload experienced by nurses and
are not designed to identify mutable microsystem factors that contribute most to nursing workload.
 A promising development in nursing workload research is the increasing emphasis on measuring
situational workload which best explains the workload experienced by nurses due to healthcare microsystem
design. Situational workload is most affected by performance obstacles (i.e., delays, interruptions, etc.) in the
local work environment and can be applied at the unit, job, or patient-levels. Most importantly, it is diagnostic
of underlying contributory factors and therefore actionable for improvement. To date, situational workload has
been measured using subjective surveys which are work-interrupting, thus difficult to integrate into practice.
 Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC), in collaboration Johns Hopkins University (JHU),
will employ a systems engineering human-centered design process to design, develop, and validate
new multi-level models of NICU nursing workload derived from readily accessible electronic health
record (EHR) data. The validated models will be the foundation for a future EHR-based clinical
decision support (CDS) tool that will track the real-time workload of registered nurses, predict near-
term future unit workload, and guide workload reduction and balancing interventions. The project’s
three Specific Aims are: Aim 1. To conduct a comprehensive HFE-based analysis of NICU nursing
workload; Aim 2. To design and develop real-time multivariable workload models and Aim 3. To
validate the real-time workload models at VUMC (A) and to determine the generalizability of the
models at an external hospital (B)."

The bacterial genome is organized into a compact form, known as the nucleoid, consisting primarily of the
supercoiled circular DNA chromosome and DNA-binding proteins. Generation and maintenance of the nucleoid
structure, which arises without a nuclear membrane or the chromatin present in eukaryotes, is critical to bacterial
health; understanding the factors that give rise to this structure are thus important for promoting synergistic
bacteria and disrupting antagonistic pathogens. Likewise, the dynamics governing DNA loci diffusion and
intranucleoid transport govern the time scales for DNA-protein binding. A key open question surrounding the
structure and dynamics of the nucleoid is elucidating those factors that can be attributed to its polymeric nature
and those that are of biological origin. Indeed, many of the most intriguing ideas emerging from the microbiology
community in the past decade, such as density waves, the glass-like behavior of the nucleoid in the absence of
metabolic activity, and the connection between solvent quality and macrodomain formation, rely on connecting
nucleoid biology to polymer physics. Unfortunately, making these connections in a definitive, quantitative manner
has been frustrated by (i) the lack of a suitable physical model of the nucleoid and (ii) experimental data that,
when combined with such a model, are sufficient to establish the governing biophysical principles. To resolve
this gap in our understanding, this proposal couples (i) a multiscale, polymer physics-based model of the
nucleoid that reflects both its equilibrium and non-equilibrium aspects to (ii) state-of-the-art biophysical
experiments probing the nucleoid structure and dynamics. Any model of the nucleoid must respect the
biological fact that the nucleoid is not a fully equilibrated system; the combination of topological domains,
macrodomains and chromosome interacting domains are evidence that the nucleoid is not in a global equilibrium
that samples the full configurational space, even if these domains can locally equilibrate over the time scale of
cell division. We will parameterize a computationally tractable, coarse-grained (CG) model of the entire out-of-
equilibrium nucleoid based on simulations of the rapidly equilibrated, fine-scale phenomena. By construction,
the CG model will incorporate large-scale, non-equilibrium constraints imposed by biology. We will then study
nucleoid structure and dynamics over parameter ranges far beyond those available in existing data sets, using
both GPU-accelerated simulations of the CG model, live cell imaging, and a microfluidic experimental system.
The experiments will improve the CG model through feedback between them, while the CG model will reveal the
most useful systems for experimentation and aid in interpreting their results. Our approach will definitively
establish the physical laws governing nucleoid structure and dynamics. Applying those laws at biologically
relevant parameter ranges then provides a foundation for identifying when polymer physics can (or, even more
importantly, cannot) be used to understand nucleoid biology."
10800114,"Significant advances in prevention and mitigation of cardiovascular disease have been made, but
related morbidity and mortality remain high. Cardiac conditioning is a therapeutic approach to induce
endogenous protective adaptive responses in the heart for counteracting myocardial loss. Identification of new,
widely applicable, practical, and effective strategies to induce cardiac conditioning continue to be a priority.
Exercise is one of the most powerful modifiers of cardiovascular risk, with proven benefits for both healthy and
diseased hearts. One key component of exercise is episodic heart rate (HR) acceleration interspersed with
periods of rest. The degree and pattern of HR acceleration informs the benefit of physical activity, with a HR
increase to 75-85% maximum predicted by age, for 75-150 min/wk, divided over 3-5 d/wk, being a typical
recommendation for promoting cardiovascular conditioning. Conversely, an impaired HR response to exercise
is associated with adverse clinical outcomes in healthy adults and those with heart disease. Furthermore, our
recently published findings indicate that an episodic exercise-similar envelope of HR acceleration can serve as
a trigger for myocardial conditioning and ischemic stress resistance. Specifically, in mice sham intervention
was compared to exercise-similar episodic HR acceleration, delivered by an atrial pacing protocol with
preserved atrioventricular and interventricular synchrony. The episodic exercise-similar pacing envelope
improved myocardial ischemic stress tolerance with an effect size similar to that afforded by treadmill exercise
or ischemic preconditioning. Hearts from paced mice displayed changes in Ca2+ handling, coupled with
changes in transcriptional and posttranslational remodeling associated with a cardioprotective paradigm.
In human subjects with already-implanted pacing devices for treatment cardiomyopathies with chronic,
medically refractory systolic heart failure, and left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) <=35%, the exercise-similar
pacing pattern, delivered through manual programming, was hemodynamically and symptomatically well-
tolerated. Furthermore, preliminary results in subjects who underwent pacing intervention 3 days/week over 4
weeks indicate increased 6-min walk distance, as well as trend towards improved EF, vs. sham intervention.
 Building on these data, the proposed project will further delineate the mechanisms for myocardial
conditioning promoted by the exercise HR envelope using two synergistic but independent approaches: 1)
Study of wildtype and genetic mouse models to probe, dissect and validate molecular mechanisms underlying
cardioprotection driven by an exercise HR pattern, and 2) Leveraging the compatibility of the proposed
intervention with existing clinical pacing platforms to establish a mechanistic link between exercise’s HR
pattern and cardiac conditioning in human subjects with cardiomyopathies. If successful, the results will lay the
groundwork for expanded use of existing pacing hardware as a novel treatment to improve functional status
and quality of life, reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, and promote engagement in physical activities."
10800289,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Each year, more than a million US women experience adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs) associated with a
two-fold higher risk of future maternal CVD. These APOs include preeclampsia, gestational hypertension,
gestational diabetes, preterm delivery (<37 weeks), and delivery of a small for gestational age infant. The
American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology recognize APOs as risk factors for CVD.
However, it is not yet known how to identify which women with a history of an APO are most at risk; nor are
specific, modifiable CVD risk factor trajectories from each APO to CVD well described. To date, risk prediction
exercises have only examined the utility of adding individual APOs to existing CVD risk scores. No risk
prediction exercises have addressed the clinically relevant question of which women with APOs are most at
risk for CVD, and no clinical decision support tool exists to direct care after an APO.
We propose to develop a risk classification approach to identify maternal risk phenotypes at the time of
delivery of a pregnancy complicated by an APO that are predictive of future CVD risk factors and events.
Predictive factors that inform these phenotypes may include history of individual APOs or combinations of
APOs, delivery complications, infant outcomes, and maternal demographic or behavioral factors available at or
shortly after delivery (e.g., preterm preeclampsia with BMI <30 kg/m2). We will use machine learning to
elucidate novel maternal CVD risk phenotypes in several populations: two longitudinal Nurses’ Health Study
cohorts and a retrospective cohort using electronic health record data from the Duke University Health System
and University of North Carolina Healthcare System. A national board of clinical experts will advise the
development of a clinical decision support tool to be tested using mixed methods among panels of
obstetricians, internists, and cardiologists.
Building on the existing evidence connecting APOs to CVD and leveraging the knowledge that CVD prevention
should begin early, this work will create a tailored tool to help clinicians guide the millions of women with an
APO history to appropriate screening, prevention, and referral to reduce their elevated risk of future CVD."
10800954,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most frequent arrhythmia. Reduced mRNA expression of FK506-binding protein 5
(FKBP5) was recently discovered in a transcriptomic study with AF patient tissues. However, the functions of
FKBP5 in heart are unknown. Preliminary studies revealed that cardiac specific loss of FKBP5 promotes the AF
development. The long-term goal of this project is to elucidate the function of FKBP5 in the heart and the
underlying arrhythmogenic mechanisms associated with the FKBP5 deficiency, with a view toward developing
new therapeutic strategies to reduce AF risk. We will test the overarching hypothesis that the FKBP5 deficiency
can enhance atrial arrhythmogenesis via a ‘double-hit’ mechanism, i.e. enhancement of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger 1 -
mediated triggered activity in cardiomyocytes, and promotion of fibrotic remodeling due to altered fibroblast
function. We will elucidate the proarrhythmic mechanisms due to cardiomyocyte-specific or fibroblast-specific
loss of FKBP5, respectively. We will also evaluate the anti-AF potential of targeting the FKBP5 pathway. The
proposed studies will unveil the critical role of FKBP5 in regulating cardiac electrophysiology and provide new
insights to molecular mechanisms of AF."
10802027,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Allergic diseases, including atopic dermatitis (AD), food allergies (FA), and asthma are common in young children
and are often co-morbid, suggesting a shared allergic pathobiology. Supporting this, development of these
diseases often occurs in a sequential pattern across infancy known as the “allergic march,” with a diagnosis of
AD before 12-months resulting in increased risk of FA and asthma. However, only a subset of infants with AD
proceed down the allergic march for unknown reasons. We hypothesize that different pathobiological
mechanisms (i.e. endotypes) operating in the skin, underlie AD clinical subtypes and their propensity to give rise
to additional allergic diseases. Supporting this, we have found a type 2 inflammatory skin endotype that was
greatly increased in AD subjects with FA relative to AD subjects without FA, with the ADFA+ patients also
exhibiting skin barrier abnormalities. Moreover, animal models have shown that skin barrier disruption with
inflammation can drive sensitization to allergens and the development of AD, FA, and airway inflammation.
Genetic studies also support a shared genetic disposition among allergic diseases and implicate dysregulation
of skin genes in this risk. Among adults, heterogeneity in inflammatory skin endotype has been observed,
including Th22, Th17, IL36G, and Th1 pathway activation. The roles of these endotypes in progression of infants
through the allergic march is unexplored. We have pioneered skin tape stripping (STS) RNA-seq methods to
allow repeated, minimally invasive skin expression profiling. Using these methods, we will evaluate whether
early-life skin pathobiology leads to the development of the allergic march and other sequences of allergic
disease development. Our proposal relies on phenotyping and STS samples collected in the Systems Biology of
Early Atopy (SUNBEAM) birth cohort (n=2500). From a SUNBEAM allergic disease case-cohort (n~800) we will
generate RNA-seq data on STS samples collected at birth, 2, 5, 12, 24, and 36 months, paired with allergic
disease phenotyping. In Aim 1 we will determine inflammatory endotypes of AD in infancy and their associated
patterns of gene expression dysregulation. Cellular deconvolution of RNA-seq will identify immune cell types and
changes in epidermal cellular composition that underlie different AD endotypes. We will determine whether skin
expression and endotypes, at birth and with AD at 2 and 5 mos, are predictive of food allergy at one year of age.
In Aim 2 we will determine longitudinal patterns of early life skin pathobiology that underlie the allergic march
and other sequences of allergic disease development. We will define allergic disease developmental classes,
their associated longitudinal expression and cellular composition profiles, and prospective biomarkers for allergic
disease development. In Aim 3, whole genome- and RNA-seq data will be used to identify eQTLs that influence
skin expression at each timepoint and longitudinal skin development among allergic disease groups. Using
TWAS, genetic models of early-life skin gene expression will be used with GWAS data for allergic diseases to
identify genetic variants influencing allergic disease risk through modulation of early-life skin gene expression."

Meta-learning refers to the ability to learn to learn. Whereas much progress has been made in understanding
the neural mechanisms of learning, the neural mechanisms of meta-learning are a mystery. This project will
investigate a candidate synaptic mechanism of meta-learning. Using integrated molecular, cellular, systems, and
behavioral neuroscience approaches, the proposed research will test the hypothesis that the timing rules
governing synaptic plasticity are themselves learned. Preliminary results suggest that the timing rules for
associative synaptic plasticity in the cerebellum can be adaptively tuned though experience to solve what
theorists have called the temporal credit assignment problem, precisely compensating for delays in the feedback
about behavioral errors, so that only synapses that were active around the time that an error was generated
undergo weakening during learning. If confirmed, this would represent a new dimension of the algorithms that
neural circuits use to tune their own performance through experience, with broad scientific and clinical
implications."
10808116,"Immune checkpoint inhibition (CPI) with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies has changed the treatment
landscape for several types of cancers including bladder cancer. In patients with advanced bladder cancer,
CPI can induce unprecedented durable responses. However, only a subset of patients responds to such
treatment necessitating a better understanding of mechanisms of primary resistance to facilitate the
identification of predictive biomarkers and rational combination approaches. We used an integrative approach
to identify biomarkers in a large clinical trial cohort of patients with metastatic bladder cancer that are
independently associated with response/resistance to CPI beyond tumor mutational burden (TMB) alone. We
identified three key gene modules derived from pre-treatment tumor transcriptomic data: a “good immune”
module associated with response to CPI, a stromal module associated with resistance to CPI, and a “bad
immune” module also associated with resistance to CPI, but that appears to mediate the negative impact of
the stromal module upon outcomes with CPI. Using single cell RNA sequencing data generated from fresh
bladder cancer specimens to dissect the cellular components and molecular interactions responsible for
expression of these 3 gene modules, we determined that the “good immune” module emanates largely from T-
cells and NK cells, the stromal module emanates from cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and the “bad
immune” module emanates predominantly from monocytes-macrophages (MΦ). We hypothesize that myeloid
cells drive primary resistance to CPI in bladder cancer. We further hypothesize that comprehensive cellular
and molecular maps of bladder cancer will facilitate identification of precise monocyte-MΦ subpopulations, and
CAF-myeloid-T-cell interactions, that can be leveraged to define novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets.
 With access to a unique set of clinical trial cohorts that will provide tumor tissue, blood and urine
specimens as well as outcome data to CPI, we are uniquely positioned to: (Aim 1) Dissect gene modules
associated with response/resistance to CPI using high resolution maps of the cellular and molecular landscape
of muscle-invasive bladder cancer; Aim 2: Define the role of “bad immune” module genes in governing
monocyte-MΦ-mediated immune suppression; Aim 3: Refine and validate a monocyte-MΦ-related gene
signature as a biomarker of CPI resistance in clinical trial cohorts.
 This proposal comprises an integrated network of multi-disciplinary collaborative investigators (GU
oncologists, urologists, immunologists and bioinformaticians) to accelerate translational research and
maximize future clinical benefits. These efforts will lead to the discovery of biomarkers, and potential
therapeutic targets, to extend the benefits of CPI beyond the 15-20% of patients with advanced bladder cancer
that respond to treatment."
10807741,"PROJECT SUMMARY
More than 15 million older adults have difficulty carrying out self-care, household and/or mobility activities,
referred to as a functional disability —with significant inequities by socioeconomic status. The experience of
having a functional disability frequently results in high healthcare spending and lower quality of life.
Furthermore, functional disability is associated with greater emotional, physical, and financial difficulties or
burden in family caregivers who support older adults with everyday tasks. Home environments are recognized
as a key factor in disability; however, the role of housing disrepair—including, for example, damage to one’s
roof or walls, problems with heating or plumbing— has rarely been studied for how it may contribute to
disproportionate rates of functional disability among low-income older adults and impact caregiver well-being.
Housing disrepair can be addressed, and therefore it is a potential target for interventions to improve function
and slow disability among older adults, potentially reducing caregiver burden and narrowing inequities by
socioeconomic status. The specific aims of this explanatory sequential mixed methods research study are to:
1) characterize housing disrepair among U.S. older adults and its associations with (a) functional disability
among low-income older adults, and (b) caregiving burden (emotional, physical, and financial); and 2)
characterize experiences of daily functioning of low-income older adults and their family caregivers in the
presence of housing disrepair, and identify barriers to making home repairs and preferences for addressing
disrepair. This study will generate foundational knowledge and an understanding of possible modifiable factors
and mechanisms (NIH Stage Model 0) from which to develop an intervention. The candidate, Dr. Okoye, is an
Assistant Professor at Drexel University’s College of Nursing & Health Professions and School of Public
Health, with clinical experience as a nurse practitioner. With a rigorous training plan including methodological
training in mixed methods research and intervention development and content expertise in family caregiving
and research team leadership, and with strong, committed mentorship, Dr. Okoye will become a grant-funded
independent investigator dedicated to improving health and well-being for socioeconomically disadvantaged
older adults and their families. This project is well-aligned with the strategic objectives of the NIA to understand
environmental factors that create and sustain health disparities among older adults, and reduce caregiver
stress."
10810096,"The United States is battling a drug overdose crisis fueled by deaths from the synthetic opioid fentanyl and
from the neurostimulant methamphetamine. A better understanding of the toxicity caused by these drugs,
alone and in combination, will guide strategies to prevent and to medically manage victims of these drugs.
Opioids cause death through respiratory depression and methamphetamine through the consequences of
adrenergic excess. Opioids, and potent synthetic opioids in particular, cause skeletal muscle rigidity and
airway compromise/glottic closure (GC). The relative contributions of synthetic opioid-induced GC to overall
respiratory depression are unknown. Additionally, it is unknown whether skeletal muscle rigidity and GC occur
through similar mechanisms and, as such, would be amenable to similar therapies. Therefore, in Aim 1, we
will test in rats the hypothesis that respiratory depression observed with fentanyl and its higher potency analog,
sufentanil, is due in part to GC, and that GC is a function of opioid onset rate. We will also test the hypothesis
that drugs that prevent/reverse opioid-induced skeletal muscle rigidity (e.g., dexmedetomidine) will also
prevent/reverse GC. In preliminary studies, we determined that simultaneous administration of d-
methamphetamine with sufentanil was, unexpectedly, lethal in rats likely through the induction of pulmonary
edema; fentanyl was better tolerated, and morphine even more so. Therefore, in Aim 2, we will test the
hypothesis that synthetic opioid-induced GC is worsened by d-methamphetamine and poorly tolerated; d-
methamphetamine is a metabolic and breathing stimulant, and a closed airway may precipitate negative
pressure pulmonary edema."
10810183,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The war in Ukraine has provoked the world’s current largest humanitarian displacement: since February 2022,
over 13 million people, i.e., one-third of Ukrainians, have been forced to leave their homes, resulting in nearly 6
million internally displaced persons (IDPs). War and humanitarian emergencies may exacerbate substance
use, but the incidence and prevalence of unhealthy substance use in humanitarian settings, including Ukraine,
are currently largely unknown. This lack of data limits the ability to tailor targeted, effective preventive
substance use interventions for these mobile populations. Addressing this knowledge gap is an immense
priority for Ukraine, where rates of substance use were high even prior to the Russian invasion in February
2022, and in other settings hosting large populations of IDPs, including the United States. We propose to
conduct an epidemiological substance use survey among IDPs in Ukraine during the R61 phase, followed by
R33-supported development and evaluation in a randomized controlled trial of a substance use prevention
intervention for this population. Due to burgeoning evidence and our own preliminary data, we anticipate
adapting an Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)-informed intervention, though final intervention
decisions will be responsive to the needs identified in the epidemiological phase. ACT for substance use
prevention will use acceptance, mindfulness, and behavior change processes to improve psychological
flexibility and thus support people in refraining from use. Our transnational, multidisciplinary team of community
partners, mental health experts, and behavioral clinical trial scientists has conducted studies with war-affected
populations in Ukraine and successfully used ACT to improve health behaviors among disadvantaged
populations in Eastern Europe. We will work closely with our community partner, the Alliance for Public Health
(“Alliance,” a leading non-governmental organization in Ukraine) and academic experts in Ukraine. In the R61
phase of the grant, we will conduct an epidemiological survey (n=577) evaluating substance use patterns and
risk factors among IDPs seeking medical services at mobile medical points established by the Alliance. Directly
informed by findings from the epidemiology study, we will transition to the R33 phase and will engage
community members to co-design the most appropriate prevention intervention. We will adapt the intervention
using qualitative methods (focus groups and stakeholder interviews) and conduct a pilot randomized controlled
trial (n=144) evaluating the intervention on preventing the development of substance use disorders among
IDPs, with primary outcomes including feasibility and acceptability. The expected outcome of this award is a
potentially effective and scalable intervention that could prevent at scale the development of substance use
disorders among IDPs affected by humanitarian crises. The key innovation is that this study will expand on
limited epidemiological data specific to substance use in humanitarian settings and be among the first to
demonstrate the effectiveness of an intervention to prevent substance use disorders in humanitarian contexts."
10931584,"Presently, surgical resection offers the only chance of cure for patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. While
the goal of resection is to obtain R0 (negative) margins, the reported R1 (positive tumor within 1 mm) margin
resection rates of patients undergoing pancreatic resection range up to 75% resulting in an unmet need to
intraoperatively identify live PDAC tumor. The extent of vascular involvement of tumor, potential surrounding
inflammation, desmoplastic reaction, and dense tissue abutting these critical vessels may impact successful
resections in potentially patients with borderline resectable tumors. While recent advances in fluorescent-guided
surgery and on-going active clinical trials that utilize NIR-fluorescent labeled monoclonal antibodies to target
PDAC have demonstrated PDAC tumor enhancement in some cases where tumors were positive/upregulated
expression of the receptor, these trials also highlight the need for additional molecular probes to address
biomarker heterogeneity in pancreatic cancer. These NIR-fluorescent imaging trials also highlight the need to
overcome potential fluorescent signal quenching by blood and adjacent blood vessels to improve resection
accuracy. To address these limitations, we have investigated extracellular acidic pH as a biomarker for
pancreatic cancer and conducted a Phase I safety assessment of intraoperative Multispectral Optoacoustic
Tomography (IIT trial NCT04365413). Clinical MSOT study indicated safety of the MSOT device in a human
surgical setting and our murine in vivo results suggest that tumor-specific contrast agents improve tumor
identification, our objective to develop VD-ZW800C contrast agent to facilitate image-guided surgery of PDAC.
We have developed a second generation optoacoustically detectable pancreatic cancer specific probe, VD-
ZW800C to facilitate MSOT- or NIR-fluorescent- guided resection of pancreatic cancer. The overarching
hypothesis is that VD-ZW800C will have an acceptable safety profile and use of VD-ZW800C will improve the
separation of PDAC tumor tissue from benign or fibrosis (resulting from chemo- or radiation therapy) tissues in
real-time using clinical MSOT or NIR fluorescent imaging with greater specificity than frozen pathology. Based
upon this hypothesis, we propose the following objectives: 1) Develop VD-ZW800C that is detectable using
MSOT and NIR fluorescence; 2) Evaluate preclinical toxicology and pharmacokinetics; and 3) Assess optimized
VD-ZW800C to facilitate detection of PDAC in Oncopig using MSOT and NIR-guided surgery and assess VD-
ZW800C microdose 1st-in human. Successful completion of these specific aims will produce VD-ZW800C as a
pancreatic cancer-specific probe detectable by MSOT or NIR fluorescence. We will test our VD-ZW800C probe
as both an MSOT and NIR-fluorescent detectable imaging probe in the Oncopig and 1st in human. Our long-term
impact will be in demonstrating the feasibility of VD-ZW800C as a PDAC specific targeted image guided surgical
agent for future trials."

10811622,"Project Summary
 Dysregulated energy metabolism is intrinsically linked to the development of metabolic disorders, such
as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). As universal electron carriers,
both nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and its phosphorylated form (NADP) play essential roles in energy
metabolism. The NAD kinase (NADK), which phosphorylates NAD to generate NADP, is exquisitely sensitive to
nutritional or stress signals. While the cytosolic NADK has been characterized, little is known about generation
and maintenance of NADP from mitochondria, the central organelle responsible for metabolic process and
energy production, until our recent discovery that the uncharacterized human gene C5ORF33 encodes the long-
sought mitochondrial NADK, referred to as MNADK. We have shown that MNADK, as a nutritionally-regulated,
liver-enriched mitochondrial NADK, functions as the only de novo mitochondrial NADP biosynthesis pathway.
Recently, we accumulated strong preliminary evidence that MNADK is required to maintain energy homeostasis,
redox state, and insulin sensitivity and that repression of MNADK activity by protein S-nitrosylation modification
under the high-fat diet is largely responsible for hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance induced by overnutrition.
MNADK functions as a key regulator of acetylation of major metabolic transcriptional regulators. These
observations lead us to hypothesize that MNADK is required to maintain energy homeostasis and insulin
sensitivity and that repression of MNADK activity by overnutrition critically contributes to the development of
NASH and T2DM. Mechanically, MNADK not only plays major roles in maintaining mitochondrial function and
anti-oxidative protection, but also functions as a key regulator of acetylation of major mitochondrial regulators or
enzymes that shape metabolic adaptability following metabolic challenges.
 In this application, we will utilize molecular and cellular approaches, genetically-engineered mouse
models, as well as bioinformatics to critically address the functions and mechanisms by which the sole
mitochondrial NAD kinase, MNADK, maintains energy homeostasis and protects from metabolic disorders. Our
goal will be achieved by two aims: Aim 1, to determine the functional significance of MNADK in preserving hepatic
energy homeostasis and thus mitigating the risk of metabolic disorders; and Aim 2, to decipher the molecular
mechanism by which MNADK maintains mitochondrial function and energy metabolism. Upon completion of this
project, we will have defined the function and mechanism by which the mitochondria NAD kinase preserves
energy homeostasis and thus mitigates the risk of metabolic disease. Our proposed research will not only open
a new paradigm for the study on molecular basis underlying energy metabolism, but also have important
implications in the prevention and treatment of metabolic disease."
10811624,"This application is for the Career Development Transition Award (CDTA). As a psychiatrist and clinical
researcher, Dr. Yoon has designed and conducted several clinical trials and translational research driven by
neuroscience-based hypotheses. The main goal of his research is to evaluate and develop medications for
addictive and psychiatric disorders. He is a recipient of the VA Career Development Award (CDA-2) and the
Merit Review Award. Dr. Yoon has tested novel approaches for the treatment of addictive and psychiatric
disorders, particularly focusing on alcohol use disorder (AUD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). Many of
his studies are the first to translate a novel observation in preclinical research to human therapy for these
disorders.
 Addictive and psychiatric disorders produce enormous morbidity and mortality, and are very costly to
the VA. The pharmacological approach he is testing has enormous potential to help patients suffering from
addictive and psychiatric disorders. His current Merit Review award project is being conducted to evaluate
whether the combination of ketamine (NMDA glutamate receptor antagonist) and naltrexone (opioid receptor
antagonist) is effective in reducing depression and alcohol consumption. This study is highly innovative by
asking important questions on (a) whether opioid receptor stimulation contributes to the antidepressant effects
of ketamine and (b) whether the combination of naltrexone and ketamine might be a strategy to reduce
addiction risk while rapidly treating depression. Since adequate treatment of MDD and AUD is of major clinical
importance, the ketamine plus naltrexone approach may have a transformative impact on patients suffering
from this condition.
 The CDTA will extend his capabilities beyond the current Merit Review Award project and lead his
growth and development as a clinical researcher. His research plans during the CDTA period include: (a)
conduct of six clinical trials that are currently funded (Project 1-6), (b) resubmission of two NIH R01
applications (Project 7-8), and (c) submission of two new grant applications (Project 9-10). Building on the
findings from these projects, his long-term goal is to develop new and more effective pharmacological
interventions for addictive and psychiatric disorders. In addition to these research activities, he will participate
in training activities. Dr. Yoon is actively collaborating with VA and Yale researchers. They have collected data,
shared research techniques, published papers, and submitted grant applications.
 There are three objectives.
Aim #1: To conduct six clinical trials that are currently funded (Project 1-6).
Aim #2: To resubmit two NIH R01 applications (Project 7-8) and submit two new grant applications (Project 9-
10)
Aim #3: To participate in training activities in (1) ketamine and psychiatric research, (2) neuroscience and drug
discovery, (3) addiction research, (4) clinical trials and research methodology, (5) neuroimaging, (6)
pharmacogenomics, and (7) biostatistics.
 Conclusion: The CDTA will protect Dr. Yoon’s research training and activity to develop more effective
treatments for addictive and psychiatric disorders."
10811742,"SUMMARY
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a model tyrosine kinase whose overexpression is common in
various cancers, including basal-like breast cancer (BLBC). It is becoming increasingly clear that EGFR underlies
not only conventional biochemical regulation induced by ligand-receptor binding but also much less well
understood spatial and temporal regulation mechanisms. A heterogeneous distribution of the receptor at the
plasma membrane results in an enrichment of EGFR in membrane regions with lateral dimensions of tens to
hundreds of nanometers where receptor dimerization and oligomerization is favored due to a high local
concentration of receptors. These clusters are not static but undergo continuous structural fluctuations. The
relationship between this dynamic structure and the local signaling activation are insufficiently understood, partly
because of a lack of appropriate optical tools for mapping subdiffraction limit dynamics with high temporal
bandwidth and long observation time. Aim 1 of this application takes advantage of the unique photophysical
properties of plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) that provide large and stable optical signals and also encode
information about deeply subdiffraction limit separations between NPs in their far-field spectrum to characterize
the lateral diffusion and structural dynamics of individual EGFR clusters with high temporal resolution and without
physical limitation in observation time. Previous implementations of plasmon coupling microscopy (PCM) utilized
the NP spectrum detected under darkfield illumination to identify EGFR clustering. Dark-field detection requires,
however, large (~40 nm) NP labels. In Aim 1, we will implement a new interferometric PCM (iPCM) for detecting
5 nm (to probe EGFR-EGFR contacts) and 10 nm (to probe EGFR oligomerization and clustering) gold NP labels.
iPCM will be augmented with a correlation analysis to quantify continuous fluctuations in plasmon coupling. This
technology will be applied to test the hypothesis that EGF binding results in a decrease of intracluster dynamics
and an increase in EGFR phosphorylation. Another insufficiently understood element of structural regulation that
is associated with EGFR clustering is lateral signal propagation through inter-receptor contacts or EGF-induced
second messenger release. Aim 2 will elucidate how EGFR clustering impacts NP-EGF-induced reactive oxygen
species (ROS) formation and ROS-mediated EGFR activation. In this approach EGF-functionalized NPs (NP-
EGF) with known EGF loading are not simple imaging tools for mapping sub-diffraction limit clusters of EGFR,
but instead, represent quantifiably units of local EGFR activation. In Aim 3 nanoconjugated EGF will be applied
as probe to quantify the cross-talk between EGFR activation and nitric oxide (NO) formation. As NO synthesis
is spatially and temporally strictly regulated, its concentration depends on EGFR activation, which varies as
function of the local NP-EGF concentration. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that NP-EGF-induced NO generation
is a regulatory factor for c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-mediated apoptosis in BLBC cells."
10812441,"ABSTRACT, ADMINISTRATIVE CORE
The Administrative Core will be the central hub of the B-HIVE Center and jointly directed by Stefan Sarafianos
and Bruce Torbett. The Administrative Core will help to ensure that the Center achieves its full scientific potential
by fostering a Center-wide collaborative and expansive environment that will make it greater than the sum of its
parts. Our mission will be actualized through collaborative leadership. The goal for achieving a successful Center
will rely on our collaborative leadership and support to ensure investigator connectivity and cohesiveness, a
shared and committed scientific vision amongst Center Investigators, and strategic planning. Throughout all of
our proposed scientific activities, we will focus on training the next generation of HIV scientists and engaging
beyond our Center’s investigators to recruit, develop, and retain a truly diverse B-HIVE research community. To
accomplish the goals of the Administrative Core to support the Center to be greater than the sum of its parts and
to remain at the forefront of structural and functional virology, we proposed the following Aims:
Aim 1. Leadership and Communication: Promote engagement and scientific collaboration across the Center
through effective leadership and clear communication.
Aim 2. Fiscal and Regulatory: Provide comprehensive fiscal management and timely reporting to Center
members, Center Developmental Program funded recipients, member and home institutions and the NIH, as
well assemble and complete yearly non-competitive NIH renewals and SAB reports.
Aim 3. Strategic Planning: Enhance the quality of scientific progress, technological advancements, training, and
implementing Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI).
Aim 4. Inclusion of NIH Intramural Researchers in the B-HIVE Center."
10812443,"ABSTRACT, CORE 1
Core 1 (Voth and Forli, Leads) will provide an extensive and integrated computational capability in support of the
science of the B-HIVE Projects. Many processes in HIV-1 that involve proteins, nucleic acids, and/or membranes
are inherently multiscale, spanning multiple time and length scales, which vary from the molecular to nanoscopic
to mesoscopic. Therefore, in Aim 1 bottom-up multiscale computational methods will be developed and
implemented that characterize many-protein assembly processes in the HIV-1 lifecycle. To understand in greater
detail the specific physical mechanisms which drive macromolecular interactions of HIV proteins with host factors
and nucleic acids, in Aim 2 all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, together with protein-protein docking and
kinetic modeling, will be used to build models of HIV proteins interacting with their partners. In order to support
the B-HIVE Projects through computational structure-based pipelines and tools for the analysis of targets of
interest, Aim 3 will provide well-established computational tools and methods that will also be further developed
and extended. All three Aims complement one another and each Aim will provide important input to the other
two Aims in an integrated fashion. Overall, Core 1 will extend and develop a set of powerful computational tools
in support of the B-HIVE Projects. The Core will also provide valuable new resources for the overall HIV research
community and beyond.

10812445,"ABSTRACT, CORE 2
Deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying key steps of the HIV-1 replication cycle is essential to fully
describe the biology of the virus, its interplay with host components, and for developing novel antiretroviral
therapies. Toward this goal, structural biology plays an important role, as an atomic-level understanding of
macromolecular structure and dynamics, and how alterations in structure affect function, provides mechanistic
insights into the workings of biological macromolecules. The structural biology core (Core 2) will contribute
complementary expertise, instrumentation, and resources for studying key steps of the viral replication cycle, as
described within individual projects, including viral entry/uncoating, integration, and maturation/assembly.
Core 2 includes: hydrogen deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) and cross-linking mass
spectrometry (XL-MS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, single-particle cryo-electron
microscopy (cryo-EM), and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET). HDX-MS and XL-MS methods have emerged
as powerful tools to probe protein interactions with ligands, co-regulatory proteins, and nucleic acids in solution
to yield insights into macromolecular behavior on a residue-by-residue level. NMR spectroscopy enables
determining high-resolution structures of small-to-medium size proteins and nucleic acids, probing
macromolecular interactions at atomic resolution and studying conformational dynamics. Single-particle cryo-
EM yields an understanding of macromolecular structure and dynamics for large assemblies, often with less
material and more rapidly than with traditional methods. Cryo-ET and sub-tomogram averaging (STA) is ideally
suited to studying irregular objects such as non-icosahedral protein lattices, where having 3D volumetric
information for each unique assembly, prior to ensemble averaging, is necessary to gain insight into local and
long-range structural perturbations.
Core 2 will apply existing tools to address specific questions described within individual Projects, and each
laboratory will also develop novel technologies to meet the needs of proposed research goals. The Core has
established collaborations with most current B-HIVE investigators, has developed workflows for new projects
that may emerge during the studies, and will provide ongoing consultation and training to B-HIVE members as
projects develop. The established tools provide complementary and synergistic expertise toward the broad
research goals of the center, while the training and dissemination module aligns with the broader impacts of the
NIH."
10815710,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The importance of social contact for mental and physical health is gaining widespread recognition in the medical
and neuroscience communities. Despite the abstract nature of social substrates, there is growing recognition
that striking a balance between social contact and isolation, or 'social homeostasis', is critical to mental and
physical health. Homeostatic neural control systems have been established for every essential physical
resource, including food, water, and body temperature, and act to stabilize internal values around a set point. In
contrast, the term 'social homeostasis' has only recently appeared as a conceptual placeholder and no neural
control system for social homeostasis has been identified. Intriguingly, a common feature of autism spectrum
disorder, in addition to social disruption, is atypical homeostatic behavior―including problems sleeping, unsual
eating, excessive water drinking, and hyper or hypo thermal sensitivities. However, it remains unclear whether
the neural circuits that regulate social and physical forms of homeostasis are separate or overlapping. Without
this information, we are unlikely to understand the complex ways that social contact mediates brain health and
disease. Here, we propose to bridge this gap by establishing a new framework of ‘social homeostasis’ in
which abstract social substrates are made concrete in terms of identified neural circuits. This project will
leverage state-of-the-art in vivo circuit technology to study adult male and female mice engaging in ethologically
relevant social and nonsocial homeostatic behaviors. Using specialized imaging technology, we will record the
activity of hundreds of individual neurons in real-time in awake behaving mice across social and physical
homeostatic challenges. This will illuminate the fixed and flexible dynamics of homeostatic control neurons
across distinct behavioral states. In addition, we will apply behavioral optogenetics and whole organ clearing
techniques, to establish the wiring and functional encoding of brain wide socially engaged homeostatic circuits.
If successful, we will uncover a neural control system for social resources―the first homeostatic control system
to regulate a non-physical resource. This will provide a new platform to understand the health and stability of
individuals, groups, and populations, and change our understanding of how social experience confers resilience
or susceptibility to specific disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder and depression."
10815818,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This MIRA application is to support studies of how RNA binding proteins regulate choices in alternative splicing
and other posttranscriptional steps in mammalian gene expression. We will continue our studies of two families
of regulators, the Polypyrimidine Tract Binding Proteins and the Rbfox proteins. We will examine their
molecular mechanisms of action, their biological functions, and the roles of their extended regulatory programs
in neuronal development and mature neuronal function. Multiple human diseases, including several
neurodegenerative disorders, involve the dysfunction of RNA binding proteins and aberrant splicing regulation.
To develop treatments for such disorders, we need greater understanding of both the mechanisms and the
biology of alternative splicing. We will continue our studies of the nuclear and cytoplasmic Rbfox isoforms. We
will apply biochemistry and genome edited cell lines to examine how the eight RNA binding proteins of the
LASR complex bind with each other, and how the assembled complex interacts with nuclear Rbfox to regulate
splicing. RNAseq analyses of purified complexes and genomewide iCLIP analyses will map the binding of
LASR subunits relative to the known Rbfox binding sites to reveal how the RNA within the LASR complex is
organized. We will follow up on recent studies of cytoplasmic Rbfox isoforms to examine how these proteins
regulate the translation and stability of mRNAs encoding important synaptic proteins, such as Vamp1. We will
also continue our analyses of the Rbfox intrinsically disordered region and its ability to form molecular
condensates. These analyses will be extended to IDR's in the LASR subunits to examine their homotypic and
heterotypic interactions, and the role of their condensation in splicing regulation. Our studies of the
mechanisms and biology of splicing repression by PTBP1 and PTBP2 will be continued. We will use
biochemical methods developed in earlier work and new mass spectrometry approaches to examine the
assembly and architecture of exon complexes repressed by PTBP1 and understand how PTBP1 blocks
productive spliceosome assembly. We will extend our investigation of the biological impact of two transitions in
neuronal splicing regulation: one induced early in neuronal development when PTBP1 is replaced with PTBP2,
and one occurring when PTBP2 is downregulated late in neuronal maturation. The roles of particular splicing
switches within the PTBP programs will be examined using stem cell differentiation protocols, CRISPR
mediated gene editing, and whole transcriptome expression and splicing analyses. Applying RNAseq to
subcellular fractions, we will characterize intron retention events controlled by PTBP1 and examine the
mechanisms that sequester RNAs on chromatin. Altogether these studies will yield new understanding of the
intricate molecular interactions that mediate the regulation of splicing and its misregulation in human disease."
10815741,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Self-management abilities reflect patients’ capacity to manage emotions, social roles, and chronic medical
conditions. In fact, self-management abilities are strongly associated with lung transplant candidates’ emotional
health. Both self-management abilities and emotional health while waiting for lung transplant predict post-
transplant quality of life. Additionally, a candidate’s self-management abilities and emotional health pre-
transplant are associated with post-transplant adherence to immunosuppressive medications. Given the
important role of these pre-transplant factors, the objective of this study is to optimize pre-transplant self-
management abilities and emotional health with the long-term objective of improving post-transplant quality of
life and transplant outcomes. Health coaching is an effective strategy to improve emotional health and self-
management abilities in other populations and in non-transplant candidates with chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease. We used semi-structured, qualitative interviews of lung transplant stakeholders to develop a relevant
health coaching intervention for adult lung transplant candidates on the waiting list. In our small, single-center
pilot trial we showed telephonic health coaching demonstrated improved pre-transplant self-management
abilities, emotional health, and quality of life in comparison to usual care. In this application, we propose a
randomized trial of a 30-minute telephonic health-coaching intervention once weekly for 12 weeks (compared to
usual care) in 230 lung transplant candidates on the waiting list at the Mayo Clinic in Florida or Minnesota or at
UW Medicine in Washington state. Patient-reported outcome instruments measuring emotional health, self-
management, and quality of life will be measured at baseline, 12-16 weeks following enrollment, and post-
transplant. Our primary outcomes will be differences between groups in Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire
(CRQ) domains of Mastery (a measure of self-management) and Emotional function adjusted for baseline
values. Secondary outcomes will compare the differences between groups of other psychometric questionnaire
scores, adjusted for baseline, as well as short-term post-transplant outcomes. The long-term goal of this
application is to optimize post-transplant outcomes through effective pre-transplant interventions. Our central
hypothesis is that health coaching will improve lung transplant patients’ self-management abilities, emotional
health, and quality of life pre-transplant. We further hypothesize that future studies will demonstrate that these
pre-transplant improvements in self-management abilities and emotional health will translate into improved post-
transplant quality of life. The results of this study will be used to refine the intervention and plan for a larger,
multi-center trial designed to optimize dissemination and implementation in diverse settings. This proposal
supports the NIH mission by striving to improve outcomes in lung disease patients while supporting a new
investigator in her to transition to research independence."
10815743,"Pediatric cancer is the leading cause of death in childhood from medical conditions in the US. Thus,
pediatric cancer education is important for pediatricians and family medicine physicians, so that cancer can be
diagnosed early, when it is most curable. Cancer research is vital to developing cancer cures. Since 1978, our
Pediatric Oncology Education (POE) program has provided knowledge and experience to motivate promising
students to consider careers in cancer research and related areas. Particular attention is given to including
students from groups under-represented among oncology scientists and clinicians. Program participants are
outstanding pre-doctoral biomedical science and health professions students interested in oncology careers.
 All participants are US citizens or permanent residents who can be at St. Jude for either 10 weeks (medical
students) or 11 weeks (all others). They are matched with a St. Jude faculty mentor with similar research
interests and participate in the mentor’s ongoing research program. They attend institutional research
conferences and a daily Lunch & Learn series designed specifically for them. They shadow an oncologist and
observe in surgery. They give a PowerPoint presentation on their research project in the Lunch & Learn series
and submit a project manuscript written in the style for submission to a journal in which their mentor publishes.
 The POE program is advertised by our web site, by email to over 6,000 US university science faculty and
cancer researchers at ~600 US universities and research institutions, and by St Jude Academic Programs
recruiters at numerous major scientific meetings, including the major under-represented-minority (URM)
science student meetings. Each year, about 500 students apply for the program. The 2019 acceptance rate
was 9.1% (49 of 537 applicants), and the class average undergraduate GPA was 3.8. Of the 286 participants
in 2015-2019, 52 (18.2 %) were URM, and 186 (65.0%) were females. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic
forced us to cancel our 2020 program. Our 2021 program will provide remote virtual research experiences.
 Ongoing evaluation of the program is provided by pre- and post-experience testing of the student’s
knowledge of pediatric cancer and related areas, and by post-experience surveys completed by all students
and mentors. Experienced cancer educators from prominent cancer centers review the program as on-site
consultants. We have long-term follow-up for 1,354 (99.3%) of 1363 alumni. Of the 1,151 alumni who have
completed their academic degree work, 991 (86.1%) hold a doctorate, including 211 (79.9%) of the 264 URM
in the cohort. Alumni include 55 PhDs, 29 MD/PhDs, and 5 PharmD/PhDs. Another 61 are currently in a PhD,
MD/PhD, or PharmD/PhD program. POE alumni include 34 pediatric oncologists, 18 medical oncologists, 34
surgical, radiation, or gynecological/urological oncologists, and 12 medical physicists. 1997-2019 program
participants are co-authors on some 440 peer-reviewed St. Jude publications. PI/PD Suzanne Gronemeyer,
PhD is a Margaret Hay Edwards Medalist and a Fellow of the American Association for Cancer Education."
10816571,"PROJECT SUMMARY
While it is known that a reduction in leukocyte recruitment through inhibition of chemokine receptor CXCR2
attenuates development of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in murine models of disease – and that activated pep-
tidase ADAM17 levels are associated with improved vascular remodeling – the role of ADAM17 in CXCR2-
mediated myeloid cell trafficking leading to the development of PH is unknown. There is an urgent need to close
this gap in knowledge because, until accomplished, immunotherapeutic modulation of myeloid-derived suppres-
sor cell (MDSC) contribution to the development of pulmonary vascular disease will remain beyond reach. The
overall objective of the proposed experiments is to define the contribution of ADAM17 in polymorphonuclear-
MDSC (PMN-MDSC) recruitment within the lung vasculature. The central hypothesis is that reduced ADAM17
expression and activity by PMN-MDSC is necessary for recruitment of these cells to the pulmonary vasculature
leading to PH. The scientific premise for this hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of preliminary data
demonstrating that PMN-MDSC expressing CXCR2 are necessary for development of PH in animal models of
disease, and that this circulating cell population is present to a higher degree in whole blood of IPF patients.
Additionally, ADAM17 levels inversely correlate with CXCR2 expression, and are associated with development
of severe PH. The rationale for the proposed research is that, upon completion of the studies it will be possible
to apply current MDSC-targeted therapies to disease prevention and treatment, as well as inform potential harms
in the use of ADAM17-targeted treatments for other diseases. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing
the following specific aims: 1) test the hypothesis that ADAM17 expression and functional activity is differentially
regulated in PMN-MDSC isolated from patients with PH and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and 2) test the
hypothesis that ADAM17 expression by PMN-MDSC protects against pathologic pulmonary vascular remodel-
ing. In the first aim, peripheral blood samples from patients with IPF with and without PH will be collected, in
order to define a MDSC profile in patients with disease and controls, based upon flow cytometric analysis for
MDSC sub-types. Cell populations will then be characterized for allelic discrimination of an identified biomarker
candidate, in addition to assessment of ADAM17 functional activity, including shedding and proteolytic activity.
In the second aim, wild type and transgenic mice with deletion of ADAM17 in myeloid-derived cells (LysM.Cre-
ADAM17fl/fl mice) will be used to determine the effect tissue-specific gene expression will have on the develop-
ment of PH in two models of disease (bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis and chronic hypoxia). Upon com-
pletion, the contribution of this study will be significant because it represents a translatable strategy to improve
clinical outcomes through prevention of MDSC trafficking to the lung. The proposed research is innovative be-
cause it represents a substantive departure from the status quo by shifting focus from vasodilator therapy to a
fine-tuned immunoregulatory mediator, MDSC, in the pathobiology of PH secondary to IPF."
10816573,"Project Summary: Most genetic variants associated with disease in genome-wide association studies (GWAS)
lie in non-coding gene regulatory elements (GRE; e.g., promoters and enhancers). GREs are tissue- and cell
type-specific and are identified through their epigenomic signatures, including low DNA methylation (DNAm),
DNA accessibility and certain histone modifications. The PsychENCODE Consortium has characterized brain
GREs across brain regions and developmental time points, as well as in the brains of psychiatric patients using
mostly DNA accessibility and histone modification marks. These marks, however, identify large regions of
enrichment (~300-2,000bp), providing only low resolution coverage of the important regulatory nucleotides, e.g.,
transcription factor binding sites. DNAm (especially cell type-specific DNAm) has received less attention,
although it has been linked to psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD).
 In the adult human brain, ~80% of CG and 1.5% of non-CG (CH) sites are methylated, and can be converted
to hydroxymethylcytosine (hmC) and further demethylated. In postmitotic neuronal genomes, mCH and hmC
accumulate to a significantly higher level than in other tissues--a distinct feature of the brain's epigenome.
Bisulfite sequencing (BS)-based approaches that are used to measure (h)mC can pinpoint GREs with single
base resolution, presenting a unique opportunity to refine the gene regulatory landscape of the brain cell types.
 Here we aim to create reference DNAm maps [mC and hmC, using BS and oxidative (ox)BS sequencing]
and transcriptional profiles (using RNA-seq) in two major subtypes of neurons in the human dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), namely excitatory glutamatergic (Glu) and inhibitory GABA-ergic neurons. The
proposed work is based on fluorescence-activated nuclear sorting (FANS) methods that we recently developed
to separate nuclei of different cell types from autopsied human brain, and on our recent findings that showed
unexpected relationships between DNA(h)m, GREs, and gene expression in the DLPFC Glu and GABA neurons.
 We will perform these studies at key time points of postnatal brain development and adulthood to map
DNA(h)m within active neuron subtype-specific GREs that may be vulnerable to disruption during childhood and
adolescence periods that coincide with the critical processes of brain maturation and circuit refinement (Aim 1).
This work will be complemented with single nucleus mC profiling, which will allow us to define the developmental
trajectories of mC in discrete subpopulations of Glu and GABA neurons (Aim2).
 Finally, we will profile Glu and GABA neurons in 150 autopsied DLPFC samples obtained from controls and
cases of SZ and BD, and will then map neuron subtype-specific gene expression and (hydroxy)methylation
quantitative trait loci (eQTL, mQTLS, hmQTLs) (Aim3). We will integrate QTL, transcriptome, and DNA(h)m data
with the results of SZ and BP GWAS to reveal DNA(h)m and gene expression-mediated causal risk variants and
genes, and to distinguish specific neuronal subtype(s) that are critical in the etiology of these disorders."
10816574,"1 We demonstrated in both mice and critically ill humans, that following surgical injury/infection, the gut
 2 microbiota collapse in structure, membership and function (i.e., production of health-relevant metabolites) such
 3 that both immune function and host recovery is impaired. In this proposal we seek to identify those metabolites
 4 produced by the gut microbiota that play a key and causal role in determining the outcome from surgical
 5 injury/infection via their ability to program macrophages such that they eliminate pathogens and resolve
 6 inflammation with proper timing and coordination. We show, for the first time that gut microbiome-derived
 7 metabolites (i.e., butyrate, indoles and others) can shift macrophages from the M1 to the M2 phenotype
 8 leading to recovery from potentially lethal surgical infection (i.e., S. marcescens peritonitis). Work from our
 9 collaborator (Lev Becker, PhD) recently described a “timer mechanism” by which key metabolites (i.e. lactate
10 and others) accumulate within macrophages, bind to histones and drive homeostatic gene expression so they
11 properly transition from M1 (pathogen elimination) to M2 (inflammation resolution). Therefore we will test the
12 hypothesis that recovery from surgical injury/infection is dependent on gut microbiome-generated
13 metabolites that program macrophages to clear pathogens and resolve inflammation in a properly
14 timed and regulated manner. Understanding the molecular details in this process will uncover a yet unknown
15 mechanism by which maintaining a healthy gut microbiome following surgical injury/infection enhances
16 survival. Therefore, in this proposal we will address the following specific aims:
17 Aim 1: Define the relationship between the gut microbiota, the metabolites it produces and their
18 effects on macrophage phenotypes that predicts recovery from surgical infection.
19 Aim2: Determine the composition of gut microbiome metabolites that activate macrophages co-
20 cultured with S. marcescens to express a survival-related phenotype and define the mechanisms
21 involved.
22 Aim 3: Enrich the mouse gut with select microbial consortia that are high producers of survival-
23 related gut metabolites and determine the mechanisms by which they enhance macrophage function
24 and survival following surgical injury/infection.
25 We are currently working with two world class experts in the field of immunology and microbiome sciences to
26 carry out the proposed studies and have already generated exciting and compelling preliminary data. These
27 include Dr Lev Becker, Associate Professor of Ben May Department of Cancer Research Committee on
28 Cancer Biology and the Committee on Molecular Metabolism and Nutrition and Dr Eric Pamer, Section of
29 Infectious Diseases and Global Health, Donald F. Steiner Professor; Director, The Duchossois Family Institute.
30 The work herein proposed is mechanistic, generalizable and highly translatable to surgical injury and infection."
10814637,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 There are currently 6.7 million Americans living with dementia and, without significant breakthroughs, this figure will
double to 12.7 million by 2050 (Rajan et al., 2021). There are about 46,000 long-term care (LTC) facilities in the U.S.
(Harris-Kojetin et al, 2016). More than half of LTC residents have some form of dementia (Alzheimer’s Association, 2018).
Responsive behaviors and dysfunction of the dementia care triad—i.e., the PLWD, professional Care Partner (CP), and
Family Member (FM)—are inexorably linked. The emergence of responsive behaviors can lead to disruption of the triad’s
function. Thus, it is imperative to maintain positive relationships and a high quality of life (QoL) within the triad to reduce
BPSD. Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) has demonstrated improvements in QoL and relationships for PLWD. CST is
a psychosocial intervention that promotes communication and engagement in PLWD via a structured program of meaningful
and enjoyable themes (Woods, et al, 2012). While clinical trials have shown improvement in cognition and QoL, the
potential large-scale impact of CST has been hampered by low adherence, with less than 40% completing trials (Rai, et al,
2018). One likely reason for the low adherence to CST is the reliance on generic and non-digital tools (e.g., paper-based
agendas, tools, DVDs, and board games) in facilitating the intervention. That is, even though CST aims to be personalized,
the specific interventions used in the field tend to be generic and not tailored to each PLWD’s specific interests. The use of
digital technology to implement CST would offer considerable advantages to expand and personalize the range of
stimulation content and provide a means for monitoring responses, optimizing protocols, and promoting adherence.
 The proposed Phase II study will involve the continued development and evaluation of a multi-faceted software platform
called “Building Relationships using Artificial Intelligence and Nostalgia” or BRAIN. The BRAIN Platform will be the
first-ever Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered CST digital therapy platform for PLWD. The platform, which has been shown
to be effective in an initial Phase I clinical trial, has three main goals: to improve the quality of life of PLWD, to reduce
BPSD in PLWD, and to foster positive relationships between members of the care triad. The proposed Phase II project has
the following Specific Aims: 1. Create an improved Beta version of the BRAIN Platform’s eight components: (1) the Admin
Management Dashboard, (2) the Annotation Dashboard, (3) the Log Viewer, (4) the Content Management System (CMS),
(5) the Private CMS, (6) the Control App, (7) the Home App, and (8) the Training Dashboard. 2. Fine-tune the different
classes of AI algorithms—i.e., behavioral analytics, personalized content recommendation, and personalized program
generation—in the BRAIN app such that they can (a) recognize and track 12 distinct behaviors and indicators of PLWD,
(b) use these behavioral traits as a basis for automatically rating the relative success of each activity, and (c) automatically
recommend personalized activities that are likely to be successful for individual PLWD. 3. Conduct a Cluster Randomized
Trial (CRT) of the BRAIN App to examine the app’s impact on engagement/affect, quality of life, and responsive behaviors.
4. Examine satisfaction and ease of use of the app for PLWD, LTC staff, and FMs."
10816977,"CLEVELAND DDRCC ENRICHMENT PROGRAM PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Cleveland DDRCC Enrichment has three major goals: 1) to foster membership development, 2) to grow
the Research Base by attracting new investigators and established investigators without a focus in digestive
diseases to the DDRCC, and 3) to disseminate knowledge gained from the presence of the Center. To
continue to achieve these goals during the next funding cycle, the Enrichment Program proposes the following
Specific Aims: (1) Continue to organize the DDRCC Seminar Series, which fosters an environment ripe for
collaboration opportunities between Center members through Research-in-Progress talks and a Distinguished
Visiting Professor lecture series. Research-in Progress talks enhance awareness among the membership of
the breadth and depth of digestive disease-related research currently being conducted by the Research Base.
During the previous funding cycle, the Distinguished Visiting Professors lecture series invited 23 visiting
professors, all of whom were nationally and internationally renowned in the fields of Digestive Inflammation/
Tumorigenesis or Liver Disease/Metabolism. (2) Continue to organize the Strategic Planning and Operational
Retreat, to obtain critical feedback from the membership at large. The retreat is open to all DDRCC members
to discuss programmatic, operational, and research issues related to the Center, and is an essential
component of the Center’s process for understanding the evolving needs of our members and adapting
accordingly, as well as identifying synergistic areas of research that can be targeted for future collaboration.
Provisional Center members are encouraged to attend. (3) Continue to organize the biannual Cleveland IDEAS
Symposium to foster membership development, attract investigators, and disseminate scientific knowledge in
digestive diseases research. This program, held in September 2016 and 2018, has been extremely successful
and achieved national recognition. It includes a Basic Science workshop focused on the scientific themes of
the Cleveland DDRCC and a clinical course. (4) Continue to support the professional development of junior
investigators. A major focus of the Cleveland DDRCC is development of junior investigators in digestive
diseases research. During the previous funding period, the Young Investigators Symposium was held during
Cleveland IDEAS and was moderated by the Cleveland DDRCC Young Investigators Network, which was
established in 2017 by two former P and F awardees. This Network and meets quarterly to promote
mentorship and career development opportunities through dinners with guest speakers, and provides critical
feedback for scientific papers and grant applications, and a “Mock Study Section”. The Center also hosted the
Midwest DDRCC Alliance Research Symposium. (5) Continue to promote and develop Center communication.
The DDRCC Enrichment Program also coordinates communication among DDRCC members at both CWRU
and the CCF through management of the Cleveland DDRCC website and an electronic newsletter that
includes announcements related to Core services updates, special events, and sponsored seminars."

Dr. Claudio Fiocchi is Core Director. Dr. Florian Rieder serves as Associate Director, and Drs. Jean-Paul
Achkar, Jennifer Ko and Amitabh Chak serve as Technical Directors.
 Goals of the Biorepository Core: The specific goals include: 1) Procure, process, and distribute tissue and
cells from surgical specimens and biopsies, as well as serum, DNA and stools, from patients with gastrointestinal
inflammation, cancer and controls for use in IRB-approved projects of DDRCC members; 2) Provide phenotypic,
genotypic, clinical and demographic information of the biosamples; 3) Provide isolation, purification, culture and
use of most types of gastrointestinal tract cells; 4) Advise, teach, and supervise investigators on principles,
methods, analysis and experimental design; 5) Monitor Core services and continuously evaluate the needs of
the DDRCC members to maximally benefit their research priorities, and 6) provide all above services in the
most cost-effective and least time-consuming manner.
 Benefits of the Biorepository Core: During the first 4 years of funding, the objective evidence for the
essential benefits of the Cleveland DDRCC Biorepository Core is the fact not a single investigator of the large
DDRCC community has failed to receive the type, size or number of biospecimens, as well as the training and
logistic support required for his/her studies. This success was achieved by the careful enactment of the specific
goals. A new benefit of the Core is a state-of-the-art laboratory information system (LabVantage Solutions-LV),
which tracks origin of samples, clinical information, genealogy of samples, and sample retrieval and
distribution, and has connectivity to EPIC, Copath, Sunquest, etc. This new system greatly benefits Core users
by assuring specimen quality, quick identification, diagnosis and delivery, and formal access to clinical data for

10817230,"Core G: Biomarker Core
Project Summary/Abstract
Alzheimer's is a devastating, progressive disease that affects almost 6 million Americans and this number is
expected to rise to almost 14 million in the next three decades. The cost to us is immense, both on a personal
and on a financial level. Our National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease
(https://aspe.hhs.gov/report/national-plan-address-alzheimers-disease-2018-update) sets us on a path with
several concrete goals and strategies to cure and prevent AD. In particular, one goal we must achieve is the
early diagnosis of AD and its related disorders (AD/ADRD). If we can detect the disease early, even before
symptoms have started, efforts to slow or even halt the disease may be more effective and can lead to many
more years with a high quality of life. A key to this early detection is to develop biomarkers for the disease –
ways in which, through testing of blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF – collectively known as biofluids), brain
scans, or even cognitive testing – we can detect and efficiently monitor the disease and assess treatment. The
goal of the UCI Biomarker Core is to help researchers here and across the globe in both collecting and
analyzing data from existing measures and by developing novel measures for the purposes of identifying,
quantifying, and validating factors that influence the risk of AD across the lifespan.
The UCI ADRC Biomarker Core is set to provide state-of-the-art biomarker data and analyses and we will
apply these to both existing data in our ADRC and to new data we are collecting. We will collect not only
traditional biomarkers (blood, CSF for amyloid beta and tau, structural MRI scans, PET scans, etc.), but
develop novel biomarkers as well. Our researchers have several innovative potential MRI and cognitive /
behavioral biomarkers that the Core will be assisting with that have the potential to advance our overall goal of
effectively determining disease etiology, measuring progression, and assessing effectiveness of treatment. In
addition, we know that curing and preventing AD is a monumental challenge and that our final goal will only
happen through collaborative teams and over the course of academic generations. Part of our mission in the
UCI ADRC Biomarker core is therefore to share data and techniques with the research community. As big a
part, however, is to share our knowledge and expertise with the next generation of clinicians and researchers,
providing them with training and mentorship needed to rise to this challenge."
10817202,"Cancer research and therapy development rely heavily on animal models. One of the key features desired in a
mouse model is ability to control tumor initiation and progression. However, existing methods cannot control
where and when tumor will form and/or do not allow regulation of specific oncogenic signaling patterns driving
tumor progression. Here we propose to develop an in vivo system that will provide tight control of oncogenic
signaling with precise control of timing and location within a specific organ. To achieve spatial and temporal
control of protein activity and gene expression we will use a novel optogenetic strategy that employs engineered
light-regulated proteins. Our previous studies funded by an IMAT R21 grant allowed us to develop a Light-
Regulated (LightR) domain that can function as allosteric switch to control protein activity. Using this method,
we propose to develop in vivo strategy for regulation of oncogenic protein kinases and expression of oncogenes
that drive initiation and progression of lung cancer as well as mediate development of metastatic lesions in the
lung. The goal is to build a set of tools that will allow researcher to model oncogenic signaling in a specific organ
and interrogate its role in tumor development and regulation of tumor environment. As model systems for
development of new technology, we will develop a toolkit that enables regulation of oncogenic KRas expression
and Src kinase activity at a selected location in mouse lungs with precise timing. These models will allow
researchers to interrogate the role of KRas and Src in initiation of lung cancer, its progression, and spreading to
other locations. We will also develop a system that will enable local regulation of oncogenic signaling promoting
metastasis of circulating cancer cells in the lung. This method will enable regulation of specific stages of
metastatic process. It will provide new tools for interrogation of oncogenic signaling in promoting metastatic
ability of cancer cells and regulation of the pre-metastatic tumor niche in vivo. The design of the proposed
systems will ensure their application for different cancer models."
10817224,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hurricane Maria was one of the worst natural disasters in modern US history. Maria caused an estimated
3,000 deaths and $139 billion in damage to the Island's infrastructure. Hurricane Maria caused prolonged
electricity outages that prevented people with kidney failure from accessing care. Most patients with kidney
failure receive hemodialysis at outpatient dialysis facilities three times a week. Access to dialysis during Maria
was limited or non-existent in some areas in Puerto Rico, and some patients needed to travel to other facilities
on the island or to the US mainland to receive care. Maria may have disrupted regular dialysis care, leading to
increased risk of death, hospitalization, or other adverse events. There is a crucial need to understand the
consequences of this large-scare natural disaster among this vulnerable population, given social and
healthcare inequalities, and the extensive level of destruction caused by Maria on the island. Using longitudinal
data for all dialysis patients in Puerto Rico from the US Renal Data System and qualitative interviews with
providers and clinic staff, our specific aims are as follows: 1) Examine long-term trends in outmigration among
persons with kidney failure in Puerto Rico, pre- and post-Hurricane Maria. Our working hypothesis is that
Hurricane Maria increased out-migration of kidney failure patients relative to the pre-disaster period; 2)
Estimate the long-term impact of Hurricane Maria on mortality and hospitalizations among migrant and non-
migrant patients with kidney failure, pre- and post-Maria. Our working hypothesis is that following Maria,
persons who migrated outside of Puerto Rico will experience increased mortality and hospital admissions
compared to persons who did not migrate out of Puerto Rico; and 3) Examine dialysis providers' strategies and
perceived barriers to mitigating the Hurricane's effects on patients with kidney failure and understand the long-
term consequences for dialysis provider organizations and staff through qualitative interviews. We expect
these interviews will provide in-depth, novel insights into providers' strategies to maintain continuity of care and
avoid dialysis facility closures. This proposal is a direct response to the FOA (PA-20-172) “Long-Term Effects
of Disasters on Health Care Systems Serving Health Disparity Populations.” This proposal is a first step
towards a broader understanding of the impact of Hurricane Maria on complex populations. The proposed
project aligns with the NIMHD areas of interest, including U.S. territories, socioeconomically disadvantaged
populations, as well as the overarching goal of understanding the long-term effects of natural disasters on
health disparity populations and the health care systems that serve them. We use longitudinal data for patients
undergoing dialysis (~14,000 patients since 2010) with rich clinical and socioeconomic covariates that allow us
to track migration patterns and mortality and hospitalization outcomes and qualitative interviews with providers
and clinic staff. Our study will provide evidence on the strategies, including migration that improves patient
access to care and health outcomes following a natural disaster among patients with kidney failure."
10817232,"Project Summary
Our collaborative basic science and clinical team will elucidate the mechanism(s) of ultrasound scattering in
biological tissues by systematically studying a significant component of ultrasonic scattering, the structure
function (SF), using solid tumors from animal models and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in adult human
subjects, and thereby improve the accuracy of Quantitative Ultrasound (QUS, the quantification of tissue
microstructure) techniques in noninvasive tumor detection and classification. The SF concept arises in the
context of wave scattering: the scattered power of a collection of scatterers depends not only on the
properties of the individual scatterers (modeled by the form factor), but also on the spatial correlation among
the scatterers (modeled by the SF).
 Structure function is new: The SF has largely been overlooked wherein the scatterer positions are
assumed to be uncorrelated (i.e., SF is unity). The unity SF assumption is not appropriate for dense
scattering media (e.g., solid tumors and most parenchymal tissues) or sparse media showing special
patterns of scatterer distribution. Non-unity SF has mostly been studied on simple scattering media such as
physical phantoms and blood. This investigation is new, and numerous basic science and technical
innovations will be pursued. Our goal is to systematically study the SF using animal solid tumors and human
liver and HCC data to improve ultrasonic scattering models and ultimately the diagnostic value of QUS
outcomes. The research makes contributions at the basic science level to elucidate the scattering
mechanisms by SF model development and validate using animal tumor models in vivo, and at the
translational level to improve the accuracy of tumor detection/classification using human liver and HCC data.
 Central hypotheses and aims: 1) The SF is critical to elucidate ultrasonic scattering mechanism(s)
in biological tissues. 2) The SF is sensitive to certain disease types and stages. 3) The accuracy of QUS to
noninvasively detect/classify tissues/tumors in vivo will be significantly improved when the SF is utilized
compared to when it is not utilized. To test these hypotheses, we have designed a research program with the
following aims: Aim 1. Develop theoretical SF models that match scatterer spatial distributions of
tumor/tissue types under investigation. Aim 2. Validate SF models using solid tumors in mice/rats. Aim 3.
Test the diagnostic value of SF using clinical human liver data from 100 nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
(NAFLD) participants, 150 cirrhotic participants, 50 HCC participants, and 150 normal participants.
 Summary/Impact: The SF is an ultrasound echo component that is determined by and sensitive to
the architectural pattern of tissue microstructure (e.g., liver cell nuclei). The SF will be a clinically valuable
imaging biomarker for disease diagnosis because many disease processes (e.g., HCC) remarkably change
to a unique architectural pattern and consequently change the SF derived from the ultrasound signal."
10817234,"Project Summary/Abstract: Hematopoiesis occurs at multiple sites during human prenatal development. In
addition to the primary intraembryonic hematopoietic tissues, it is now recognized that the extra-embryonic
tissues – the placenta and chorion – contain hematopoietic stem cells. The presence of hematopoietic stem
cells in these tissues raises the possibility that they actively contribute to the pool of blood cells contained in
the extra-embryonic tissues. In this proposal we focus on the human fetal membranes, specifically the chorion.
Macrophages are present in the chorion and presumably act as sentinels and first responders to infection as
well as invasion by maternal cells. The presence of these macrophages suggests that the chorion is not just an
inert physical barrier. We hypothesize that the human chorion is an immunologically active barrier containing
macrophages that develop in situ from hematopoietic stem cells that together with other cells in the chorion
maintain the maternal-fetal interface to prevent infection and immune rejection of the fetus during pregnancy.
In the first of three specific aims, we will investigate if chorionic hematopoietic stem cells serve as a local
source of precursors for monocytic cells found in the chorion. Tissues across a range of gestational ages will
be examined using flow cytometry, hematopoietic progenitor cultures, and a transplant model, using
immunodeficient mice, to determine the types of hematopoietic precursors that exist in the chorion.
Experiments will focus on demonstrating active myelopoiesis in the chorion. In the second aim, we will explore
the role of the chorionic microenvironment in the development and function of macrophages. Mesenchymal
stromal cells and cytotrophoblasts comprise the hematopoietic niche in the chorion, which will be studied in
culture to test their effects on monocyte development and macrophage maturation. We hypothesize that these
cell types support the development of M2 macrophages to foster an anti-inflammatory environment in the
chorion. This will be more specifically tested in the third aim, in which we will investigate the
immunomodulatory role of chorion cells in preventing rejection by maternal T-cells. Preliminary data show the
presence of T cells in the chorion of both maternal and fetal origin. The origins and distribution of T-cells in the
chorion will be further investigated at different gestations. Additionally, we will determine if the T-cells are
active and if they are enriched in any specific T-cell subtypes. T-cells from the adjacent decidua will be
analyzed for comparison as well as fetal T-cells from the spleen. We will explore the roles of chorionic
macrophages, mesenchymal stromal cells, and cytotrophoblasts in the regulation of T-cell activation. Together
these aims will show that chorionic macrophages develop locally from a population of stem cells in the chorion.
Also, that these macrophages, in conjunction to other cell cellular populations contribute to generate an active
immunological barrier at the extensive maternal-fetal interface that includes the fetal membranes, which
function to ward off infection and invasion of maternal lymphocytes."

10817363,"Temporomandibular joint disorder (TMJD) is a heterogeneous disease which is characterized by severe pain that negatively affects masticatory function. In the United States, TMJDs affect over 10 million individuals predominantly in middle-aged adults (20-40 years-of-age) with a higher prevalence in women than in men (NIDCR). Treatment outcomes for TMJDs are highly variable which may be attributed to the gap in knowledge of the underlying pathogenic mechanisms. Hence, a better understanding of the major contributors and causative mechanisms in TMJD may significantly improve outcome following therapeutic and/or surgical intervention. Whereas the contribution of disc degeneration in TMJD is well established, the functional consequence of impaired tendon and tendon-bone insertion in TMJD is poorly understood. Recent studies have shown that defects in tendon and tendon-bone insertion development as well as dysregulated cell signaling that negatively affect these tissues can cause deformities in TMJ (Roberts et al., 2019). Jaw movement creates biomechanical forces that are generated by the pterygoid and masseter muscles which are transmitted across tendon and tendon-bone insertion and connect to the mandibular condyle. Our preliminary studies have shown that impaired telopeptide lysyl hydroxylation and cross-linking due to Fkbp10- deficiency induces heterotopic ossification (HO) in TMJ and substantially increases mandibular condyle length and width in postnatal mice. In addition, we found that Fkbp10 deletion induces aberrant aSMA-expressing cells in the tendon and tendon-bone insertion concomitant with an increase in ectopic bone formation in the medial condyle of TMJ. Preliminary data also showed enhanced pSmad1/5 expression in the tendon and tendon-bone insertion in TMJ, indicating dysregulated BMP signaling. Based on these preliminary data, we will test the hypothesis that alterations in telopeptide lysyl hydroxylation in tendons of TMJ causes HO and functional defects due to abnormal differentiation of aSMA-expressing progenitor cells that is dependent on aberrant BMP signaling. Specifically, we will (Aim 1) determine the functional consequence of impaired procollagen I telopeptide lysyl hydroxylation and cross-linking in TMJ homeostasis, (Aim 2) determine if Fkbp10 deletion triggers tissue injury and alters aSMA-expressing progenitor cell populations, and (Aim 3) determine if pharmacological inhibition of aberrant BMP signaling can prevent HO in TMJ of Fkbp10-deficient mice. The proposed studies will provide the foundational basis and additional preliminary data to develop a competitive investigator-initiated R01 or equivalent NIH research proposal."
10817119,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overarching goal of this research project is to understand the basic principles that govern
messenger RNA degradation, a cellular process that plays a key role in regulating gene
expression in all organisms. The immediate goal is to elucidate the impact of the 5′ end on
bacterial mRNA lifetimes. In particular, this research will focus on understanding the influence
of 5′-terminal caps and 5′-end-dependent endonucleolytic cleavage on rates of mRNA
degradation in bacteria. Long thought to reside exclusively on eukaryotic RNA transcripts, caps
of various kinds have now been found on RNA 5′ ends in bacteria, yet many important aspects
of their function remain unexplained. In addition, the regulatory endonuclease RNase E has
recently been shown to locate cleavage sites in monophosphorylated RNA by a novel scanning
mechanism akin to linear diffusion from the 5′ end, but how it does so is unknown. The specific
objectives of this research project are to elucidate the structural and phylogenetic diversity of
bacterial mRNA capping and the interplay between capping, cell physiology, and stress and to
determine the molecular mechanism by which RNase E scans RNA in search of cleavage sites,
the influence of the cellular environment on this process, and the breadth of its regulatory
impact. A combination of molecular biological, biochemical, biophysical, and genetic methods
will be employed to achieve these objectives. The knowledge gained from these studies will
provide fundamental insights into novel aspects of gene regulation that have been implicated in
bacterial pathogenesis and antibiotic sensitivity."

10817123,"Project Summary
 Porphyrias are genetic disorders caused by mutations in enzymes involved in eight sequential biosynthetic
conversions that combine glycine and succinyl coenzyme-A in the first enzymatic step to ultimately generate
heme. Porphyrin accumulation also occurs in ‘secondary porphyrias’ in association with other diseases such as
hepatitis C virus infection. Current major unmet needs with regard to the porphyria disorders include: (a) our
present limited understanding of the biochemical mechanism of cell and tissue injury, (b) the molecular triggers
of porphyria acute attacks, (c) the reasons why some individuals develop significant organ complications such
as end-stage liver disease that requires liver or bone marrow transplantation, while others do not, and (d) the
limited availability of drugs to treat the different porphyrias. Our central hypothesis is that the liver is susceptible
to light-independent porphyrin-mediated proteotoxic damage that leads to cell and tissue injury in porphyria, and
that drugs can be identified that lead to increased or decreased porphyrin accumulation. This hypothesis will be
tested by pursuing three interconnected specific aims: (i) Define the mechanism of light-independent porphyrin-
induced protein aggregation in internal organs, with a focus on the liver; (ii) Elucidate the mechanism of
detoxification of porphyrin-induced proteotoxic damage using in vitro and in vivo models; and (iii) Characterize
small molecules that decrease or increase tissue porphyrin accumulation and porphyrin-mediated proteotoxicity.
We have assembled extensive preliminary results to support the likely success of our aims, including substantial
evidence for porphyrin-mediated protein aggregation that is light-independent, the reversibility of protein
aggregation and enzymes that are likely to be involved in reversing protein oxidation, and the use of zebrafish
high-throughput screening to identify known drugs that decrease or increase porphyrin accumulation in liver. The
drugs that decrease porphyrin accumulation will be tested for their mechanism of action and examined in
preclinical porphyria experimental models as drugs that may be repurposed as potential new therapies. In
parallel, drugs that increase porphyrin accumulation will be characterized as potential candidate drugs to avoid
in patients with porphyria.
 Completion of our proposed aims provides fundamental knowledge regarding which proteins are prone to
porphyrin-mediated oxidation and aggregation, the molecular signatures that define such aggregation, the
mechanism of aggregate turnover and disaggregation, whether compounds we characterize are candidates for
testing in patients with porphyria, and whether currently used drugs in non-porphyria disorders might need to be
avoided or monitored in patients with porphyria. This proposal uses state-of-the-art technologies, multiple
biochemical and porphyria animal model tools including zebrafish and mice, and introduces the novel concept
of proteotoxicity as an alternative mechanism for porphyria exacerbations and progression that may shed light
on genetic modifiers that account for liver disease progression in some patients but not others."

Fatty fibrosis, the replacement of healthy muscle tissue with fat and fibrotic scar tissue, is a prominent feature of
chronic muscle diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), sarcopenia, the age-related loss of
skeletal muscle and strength, in addition to obesity, and diabetes. This project will identify and characterize the
cellular and molecular mechanisms by which intramuscular fat forms, and the functional consequences of
intramuscular fat on muscle health. Recent evidence points to ciliary Hedgehog signaling as a potent ant-
adipogenic signal during muscle regeneration and in mdx mice, a mouse model of DMD. In addition, Hedgehog
promotes muscle repair and prevents the decline in myofiber size in mdx mice. By what mechanism(s) Hedgehog
acts to balance fat formation and muscle regeneration is unknown. This proposal will use innovative and powerful
mouse models to identify the role of Hedgehog signaling during muscle regeneration in the following aims: 1)
Identify and characterize the responsible Hedgehog ligand; 2) determine which cell types respond to Hedgehog
signaling; and 3) demonstrate if intramuscular fat directly affects muscle health. Taken together, this proposal
will provide insights into the origin and function of intramuscular fat and will aid in the search for novel therapeutic
interventions into human diseases affected by fatty fibrosis."

Ankle contractures in muscular dystrophy: mechanisms and tissue adaptations
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a genetic disorder that causes progressive muscle degeneration and
weakness leading to difficulties walking, using the arms, and breathing. In addition to muscle weakness,
individuals with muscular dystrophy often lose flexibility in joints such as their ankles, knees, hips, elbows, and
hands. This loss of range of motion, called a contracture, can cause difficulty with function, positioning, and
comfort. The loss of ankle joint range of motion and development of plantarflexion contractures affects nearly all
children with DMD while they are still able to walk, and contracture prevention and management is a major goal
of rehabilitation for ambulatory children with DMD to allow for maximal function and quality of life. However, there
is little convincing evidence to demonstrate that currently prescribed contracture interventions are effective or
improve function, and this is likely due to a gap in knowledge about the pathophysiology of contracture
development in DMD. The goal of this proposal is to prospectively evaluate the potential mechanisms driving
loss of ankle range of motion in DMD and the plantarflexor muscle and/or tendon changes that result. Our central
hypothesis is that progressive proximal muscle weakness and degeneration drives ankle contracture
development in ambulatory children with DMD and that the primary adaptation in the plantarflexor muscle-tendon
unit is shortening of the Achilles tendon. In aim 1, we will quantitatively evaluate lower extremity muscle strength
and muscle replacement by fat using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate the impact of muscle
weakness and degeneration on ankle joint dorsiflexion range of motion in ambulatory individuals with DMD. In
aim 2, we will evaluate the tissue adaptations occurring alongside loss of joint range of motion including changes
in plantarflexor muscle length, Achilles tendon length, Achilles tendon structure, and muscle-tendon passive
stiffness. Data collected from this study will help physical therapists and other rehabilitation professionals better
understand the causes of ankle contractures in muscular dystrophy, which will lead to more evidence-based
decisions about targeted interventions that may help prevent or slow contracture formation."
10808071,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Gammaherpesviruses (GHVs) establish lifelong chronic infections that place the host at risk for numerous
cancers. During chronic infection, GHVs express viral gene products that stimulate host-cell proliferation and
differentiation, processes thought to facilitate long-term latent persistence and contribute to tumorigenesis.
However, GHVs are not acutely transforming, and cancer is rare given the high incidence of infection among
adult humans, estimated at more than 95% for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). This suggests that host cells are
equipped with an intrinsic resistance to GHV-driven proliferation and cellular immortalization. In work performed
during the previous funding period, we identified the tumor suppressor p53 as a protein that is activated during
the establishment of GHV latent infection. p53 is frequently considered a “guardian of the genome”, working
downstream of multiple mutagenic pathways to halt cell-cycle progression, stimulate DNA repair, or promote
apoptosis. p53 is frequently mutated in human cancers, including endemic Burkitt lymphoma, an EBV-associated
lymphoma that is characterized by a chromosomal translocation between the immunoglobulin heavy-chain
promoter and cellular proto-oncogene c-myc. It is hypothesized that EBV synergizes with malaria, to promote
the survival of cells that harbor IgH/c-myc translocations. Using murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) infection
of mice as a small animal model to enable a multi-system analysis GHV pathogenesis, we demonstrated that
p53 limits cellular proliferation, especially of germinal center (GC) cells. We also found that p53 inhibits IgH/c-
myc translocations in B cells of infected mice, an event that correlates with enhanced B cell lymphoma
development in p53-deficient mice infected with MHV68. Moreover, we provide preliminary data indicating that
co-infection of mice with MHV68 and a murine malaria parasite also promotes IgH/c-myc translocations.
Experiments proposed in this competing renewal will build on our previous progress, harnessing the powerful
mouse and MHV68 genetic systems, to (i) define viral genes and molecular pathways that promote genomic
instability and lymphoma development, (ii) identify viral and host-factor dependencies in GHV-driven lymphomas,
and (iii) determine the mechanisms through which MHV68 and murine Plasmodium parasites facilitate
chromosomal translocations. In addition to providing a better understanding of how GHVs cause disease, we
anticipate that results of this work will inform new therapeutic approaches that target lymphoma dependencies
and reduce the mutagenic potential of GHVs and related co-infections."
10977288,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Gammaherpesviruses (GHVs) establish lifelong chronic infections that place the host at risk for numerous
cancers. During chronic infection, GHVs express viral gene products that stimulate host-cell proliferation and
differentiation, processes thought to facilitate long-term latent persistence and contribute to tumorigenesis.
However, GHVs are not acutely transforming, and cancer is rare given the high incidence of infection among
adult humans, estimated at more than 95% for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). This suggests that host cells are
equipped with an intrinsic resistance to GHV-driven proliferation and cellular immortalization. In work performed
during the previous funding period, we identified the tumor suppressor p53 as a protein that is activated during
the establishment of GHV latent infection. p53 is frequently considered a “guardian of the genome”, working
downstream of multiple mutagenic pathways to halt cell-cycle progression, stimulate DNA repair, or promote
apoptosis. p53 is frequently mutated in human cancers, including endemic Burkitt lymphoma, an EBV-associated
lymphoma that is characterized by a chromosomal translocation between the immunoglobulin heavy-chain
promoter and cellular proto-oncogene c-myc. It is hypothesized that EBV synergizes with malaria, to promote
the survival of cells that harbor IgH/c-myc translocations. Using murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) infection
of mice as a small animal model to enable a multi-system analysis GHV pathogenesis, we demonstrated that
p53 limits cellular proliferation, especially of germinal center (GC) cells. We also found that p53 inhibits IgH/c-
myc translocations in B cells of infected mice, an event that correlates with enhanced B cell lymphoma
development in p53-deficient mice infected with MHV68. Moreover, we provide preliminary data indicating that
co-infection of mice with MHV68 and a murine malaria parasite also promotes IgH/c-myc translocations.
Experiments proposed in this competing renewal will build on our previous progress, harnessing the powerful
mouse and MHV68 genetic systems, to (i) define viral genes and molecular pathways that promote genomic
instability and lymphoma development, (ii) identify viral and host-factor dependencies in GHV-driven lymphomas,
and (iii) determine the mechanisms through which MHV68 and murine Plasmodium parasites facilitate
chromosomal translocations. In addition to providing a better understanding of how GHVs cause disease, we
anticipate that results of this work will inform new therapeutic approaches that target lymphoma dependencies

 Rod-mediated vision transitions seamlessly to cone-mediated vision as light levels rise through the
mesopic visual range. Despite the fact that mesopic vision is the major mode of vision for people who spend
most of their time indoors under artificial lighting, there is a glaring lack of knowledge of how rod and cone
photoresponses shape the temporal, spatial, and spectral sensitivities of mesopic vision. For decades it has
been accepted that rods subserve vision in dim scenes, detecting only slow variations in light levels (contrast),
and cones subserve vision in bright scenes when contrast changes rapidly. Our recently published results show
that at indoor (mesopic) light levels, rods drive the visual responses to fast — not slow — temporal variations.
Our findings reveal, for the first time, that adaptation of both rod and cone-driven visual responses underlie the
seamless transition between scotopic and photopic vision over the mesopic range, but we do not understand
how this happens. Therefore, there is a critical need to understand the physiology and functional significance of
rod responses at mesopic, indoor light levels. In this application our objectives are: (i) to determine the adaptation
mechanisms that control the responses of rods to slow and fast light variations in mesopic lights, and (ii) to
determine the behavioral significance of rod-driven visual responses to fast changing scenes in mesopic lights.
Our model is that a hierarchical system of adaptation mechanisms is in place to differentially regulate rod
sensitivity as lights rise through the mesopic range. To test this model we propose two related but independent
aims that investigate the underlying cellular and perceptual mechanisms. These aims are to determine 1) how
rods respond to slow and fast variations in mesopic lights, and 2) the behavioral significance of inner segment
conductances to the adaptation of rod visual responses in mesopic lights. For the first aim we will combine the
power of mouse genetics, electrophysiological recordings, quantitative modeling, and operant behavioral assays
to determine how different phototransduction adaptation mechanisms, including background and bleaching
adaptation, work together to differentially regulate the responses to slow and fast light variations and to overcome
the crippling effects of response compression in mesopic illumination. For the second aim, we will use mice with
rod-specific knockout of voltage-gated conductances that are typically activated at mesopic lights to probe the
functional significance of inner segment conductances to rod-driven responses in mesopic lights. Our expected
outcome is to provide evidence for mechanisms that the visual system uses to encode signal variations in
mesopic lights (Advancement of Basic Knowledge). Knowledge of this mechanisms will open new strategies for
understanding and treating retinal pathological conditions, with implications beyond this particular application
(Innovation for Emerging Therapy)."

10801741,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Atopy, Asthma and food allergies are highly prevalent inflammatory disorders that are increasing at an epidemic
 rate. Progression of allergies from one system to other, ultimately involving multiple organs, called “atopic march” is
 not uncommon in infancy. Aberrant type 2 immune responses to allergens have long been appreciated as the
 major driver of allergic reactions, with symptoms of very severe bronchospasms in asthma to vomiting and diarrhea
 observed in food allergies. Type II cytokines (IL-4 and IL-13) are both the drivers and effector molecules that drive
 allergic reactions. It is believed that IL-4 and IL-13 cytokines work on innate and adaptive immune system to induce
 and perpetuate type II inflammatory allergic reactions. We undertook a scRNAseq analysis to identify the cell types
 where IL-13R is expressed and we identified a cluster of enteric sensory neurons and multiple clusters of DRG and
 nodose ganglion neurons that express IL-13-specific receptors. This raises the issue of what is the role of IL-13R on
 the sensory neurons in the lung and gut in regulating allergic inflammation. Our preliminary data show that enteric
 neuron-specific deletion of IL-13R (Il13ra1) failed to control the worm burden and fecundity of the intestinal helminth
parasite Heligmosomoides Polygyrus (Hp). Furthermore, Hp-infected Il13ra1 conditional knock-out (cKO) mice
 displayed severe impairments in the upregulation of Nmu and Calcb neuropeptide expression, suggesting neuronal
 IL-4/IL-13-receptor signaling contributes to the amplification of immunomodulatory neuropeptide expression during
 intestinal helminth infection. Initial scRNAseq of the immune and non-immune cells of the intestines of the Hp-
 infected IL-13R conditional knock-out mice suggest epithelial cell reprogramming and reduction is the number of
ILC2. Based on these preliminary data, we hypothesize that cytokine-neuropeptide feedback loops between
 immune cells and neurons regulate type 2 inflammation and the development of type II allergic inflammation. We
 propose two specific aims to address this hypothesis:
 1) Determine the role of type -2 cytokine receptor, specifically IL-13R signaling in neurons for the
 development of type 2 inflammation in the lung and gut; 2) How do the cytokine receptors on
 enteric neurons affect barrier integrity and host defense?
Together these two aims will begin to address the functional role of type II cytokine receptors (specifically
IL-13R) in regulating neuronal activation, neuropeptide production, and development of type II inflammation.
The project will also focus on characterizing novel molecular interactions between cytokines, neurons and the
immune system to regulate the differentiation and function of the innate and adaptive immune system, with an
ultimate aim to find translatable therapeutic targets for chronic allergic diseases."

REMI Platform for Remote EEG Monitoring
The REMI EEG screening platform. The REMI app running on a medical tablet guides staff through the
placement of four Epilog sensors. Epilog transmits EEG through Bluetooth to the app which then relays the
data to a cloud server running Persyst EEG reviewing software. An epileptologist logs on to Persyst Mobile to
remotely review Epilog EEG in real time as a 10-channel “longitudinal-transverse” montage in Persyst.
PROBLEM There is a clear need for discrete, wearable EEG that can be deployed by non-EEG professionals
in an emergent setting, especially in community and rural hospitals that lack an EEG service. Rapid neuro
screening with EEG is critical for situations when patients are at risk of under-treatment if they are having
undetected subclinical or non-convulsive seizures, over-treatment if EEG is normal, and delayed treatment if
they are transported to a tertiary hospital for diagnosis.
WEARABLE SOLUTION
Epitel has developed Epilog, a wireless
wearable EEG sensor capable of transmitting
EEG to a recording, display, and review
platform called REMI (Remote EEG
Monitoring). Developed through R43/R44,
REMI synchronizes four Epilog sensors
placed by hospital Emergency Department
(ED) staff within minutes of patient arrival
who are suspect of seizures, prior to initial
treatment. REMI securely transmits the data Epilog sensors use a one-piece conductive and adhesive
to its cloud server where Persyst® software ‘sticker’ that attaches the sensor to the scalp below hairline.
processes the EEG in the real time for live
remote review by an epileptologist using Pesyst Mobile. As the final milestone in R44, Epitel cleared the REMI
platform with FDA (K203827) for use as a remote EEG screening tool for emergent care in EDs and intensive
care units, specifically targeting community and rural hospitals that do not have access to neurology or EEG.
REMI enables epileptologists to remotely direct time-sensitive treatment more accurately and faster in hospitals
that lack neurology or the capability to provide emergency EEG services.
COMMERCIALIZATION READINESS PILOT (CRP) Gaining market clearance through FDA is simply the first
step toward commercialization. We have identified 5 post-FDA development activities designed for translation.
 1. Demonstrate Clinical Utility through a multi-center, prospective, blinded, randomized clinical trial
 in children and adults
 2. Health Economics and Outcomes Research
 3. Intellectual Property Strategy assistance
 4. Manufacturing Optimization
 5. Go-to-Market Technical Assistance
The value of this CRP for Epitel is evidence for clinical utility, health economics modeling, market access, and
manufacturing optimization. The technical assistance provided through this CRP will de-risk our technology to
make the REMI platform attractive to venture capital investment prior to full commercialization."

Programming the immune system to detect neoantigens and destroy tumors is critical for effective
immunotherapy. Until now, bioinformatic prediction of neoepitopes on tumors from Next Generation Sequencing
(NGS) information has been used alone or in conjunction with immunological assays to indirectly infer neoepitope
identification. Unfortunately, only a small fraction of predicted epitopes are surface-displayed as HLA-bound
peptides (pMHC), a process required for cytolytic T lymphocyte (CTL) targeting. Moreover, immunologic assays
suffer from both high false positive and false negative rates, confounding correct identification. Conventional
mass spectrometry (MS) approaches to interrogate the pMHC, referred to as the cell's immune peptidome, suffer
from poor HLA recovery, requirement for multiple sample runs to achieve adequate peptide coverage and
necessitate large numbers of tumor cells, all features impractical for routine clinical use. Our Academic-Industrial
Partnership (AIP) advances the creation of a commercial pipeline to deliver personalized tumor neoantigen
identification, integrating NGS-based genomics and transcriptomics, bioinformatics, chemical peptidomics and
a novel, ultrasensitive form of MS. Our interdisciplinary/multi-institutional strategic alliance combines basic
research at Dana Farber Cancer Institute with industrial expertise at Curacloud Corporation and JPT Peptide
Technologies. We propose deployment of an attomole (10-18) Poisson detection liquid chromatography-data
independent acquisition (LC-DIA) MS method for antigen discovery to electronically record and capture the entire
immune peptidome comprising both numerous self-peptides and sparse neoantigens in a single run from small
numbers of tumor cells (106) retrieved by clinical needle biopsy. This approach changes the aforementioned MS
calculus and permits neoantigen search at any point following data collection using existing commercially
marketed MS instrumentation. In Aim 1 neoepitope candidates shall be chemically synthesized in high
throughput pools of up to 6,000 peptides per nanoscale run by JPT for MS fragmentation analysis and elution
mapping reference standards for definitive neoantigen identification using LC-DIAMS on individual tumor
samples based on DFCI technology, optimizing each step. In Aim 2 we shall use NGS data from tumor cells in
conjunction with bioinformatics at Curacloud to predict neoepitopes arising from coding and non-coding regions
capable of interacting with each HLA-A, -B and/or -C allele of a patient. Machine learning-based neoepitope
ranking algorithms incorporating MS data and other results shall be developed for candidate prioritization. An
end user service shall be established involving all aforementioned integrative technologies. From initial tumor
biopsy to identification of neoepitopes, a time scale of approximately one month is anticipated. This generic
neoepitope precision identification pipeline is applicable to multiple immunotherapy protocols as well as immune
monitoring of tumor evolution at the original and any metastatic site, informing therapeutic adjustments as
required."
10805376,"The proposed research explores molecular approaches for the study and regulation of aberrant
metalloenzyme activity in human disease, focusing on the structural and chemical biology of histone
deacetylase (HDAC) isozymes 6, 8, 10, and 11. These zinc-dependent enzymes are targets for drug design
efforts aimed at developing new approaches to cancer chemotherapy, treatment of neurodegenerative
disease, and immune modulation. To advance our understanding of structure and function in this important
family of metalloenzymes, and to enable innovative molecular approaches for new disease therapies, we aim
to pursue the following lines of investigation:
 (1) We propose to determine crystal structures of HDAC6 complexed with fluorinated inhibitors to probe the
medicinal chemistry of a fluorophilic crevice in the enzyme active site. These studies will also inform optimal
approaches for the development of 18F derivatives used in PET imaging of HDAC6 and other proteins. We will
also determine structures of complexes with large macrocyclic octapeptide and nonapeptide inhibitors that will
map out interactions in the outer active site cleft. Analysis of these complexes will illuminate structural features
in the outer active site cleft that also accommodate the binding of large protein substrates. Finally, we will
explore the preparation and structure determination of a ternary complex of HDAC6, the E3 ubiquitin ligase
protein cereblon, and a proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC).
 (2) We propose to explore the structural basis of HDAC10 substrate specificity to better understand the
cryptic lysine deacetylase activity observed for this polyamine deacetylase. The binding of acetyllysine-
containing substrates must require conformational changes in the active site to switch between the binding of
bulky peptide and protein substrates versus slender polyamine substrates. Additionally, we will determine
crystal structures of complexes with HDAC10-selective inhibitors containing mercaptoacetamide zinc-binding
groups. In view of the genotoxicity associated with degradation of the hydroxamate moiety, HDAC inhibitors
are needed with alternative zinc-binding groups that exhibit improved stability and safety profiles. Finally, we
will explore the preparation and structure determination of a ternary HDAC10-PROTAC-cereblon complex.
 (3) We propose to study the structural basis of the lysine-fatty acid deacylase activity of HDAC8 and
HDAC11. We will determine the structure of an intact enzyme-substrate complex with HDAC8 to map out the
fatty acid binding site. We will also explore the crystallization and structure determination of the sole class IV
isozyme, HDAC11, which represents the last frontier of HDAC structural biology. We aim to bring the same
rigor of structure-function analysis to this isozyme as we have brought to other HDAC isozymes in recent
years."
10801650,"PROJECT SUMMARY: The high rates and upward trend of mental health (MH) problems among young
Asian Americans (AAs) are disturbing. Despite mounting evidence of MH crisis, AAs are severely understudied,
exacerbating health disparities. Spikes in sociopolitical tensions and racial hostility in recent years may explain
the upsurge of the problems. Young AAs are under great acculturative as well as minority stress, including
being the frequent victims of hate crimes, experiencing harmful objectification by the majority and other
minority groups, and having their American identities questioned. This stressful environment has been
aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has provoked an unprecedented surge in anti-Asian racism and
bigotry. There is a particularly pressing need for young AAs to identify ways to navigate these multifold
pressures. This proposed study will extend an existing, highly successful longitudinal study of young AAs. The
Midwest Longitudinal Study of Asian American Families (MLSAAF) is an ongoing survey of Filipino American
(FA) and Korean American (KA) families (786 youth and their parents; MAGE of youth = 15 at Wave 1 in 2014).
Wave 4 in 2021 collected data from 615 young adults (YAs) (MAGE=21.5; 78% retention). The MLSAAF has
substantiated a troubling upward trend in MH struggles from 2014 to 2021 as participants transitioned to early
young adulthood (YAH). We also uncovered racial discrimination and intergenerational cultural conflict (ICC)
in the family as the etiology of this upsurge of problems. Minority and acculturative stresses are expected to
amplify as YAs build careers and families of their own. AA families remain interdependent during YAH, with
unwavering expectations of familism, conceivably prolonging ICC among AA YAs. By adding 3 waves, the
proposed study will leverage the rich and rare MLSAAF data to follow the original samples from adolescence
(ADOL) into their twenties to disentangle the complex and dynamic effects of family process, minority stress,
and acculturation across the critical stages of YAH, including such pivotal outcomes as education, employment,
marriage, and parenthood. Biomarkers (cortisol, C-reactive protein, and sleep) are added to investigate
physiological damage of chronic stress from racial/cultural minority status. The inclusion of biomarkers will
significantly enhance our capacity to more accurately assess biological, physical, and psychological harms of
chronic stress that individuals may be unaware of. This study will (1) determine the trajectory and etiology of
MH and physical health among young AAs as they transition from early ADOL to YAH. We will test (a) how AA
family process (e.g., harmful vs. beneficial practices) is concurrently and longitudinally associated with ICC and
the MH/health outcomes and (b) how racial discriminations are concurrently and longitudinally associated
with poor outcomes, (2) investigate how bicultural competence mitigates the negativity of chronic psychosocial
stressors (i.e., ICC and discrimination) and (3) to examine the associations in Aims 1 and 2 with biomarkers as
outcome measures and to identify harms of chronic stress that self-report measures may not capture."

Expanded cannabis legalization nationwide and increased use among reproductive-aged women have exposed
gaps in our scientific knowledge on whether and/or how cannabis use during lactation affects human milk
composition. Human milk is considered optimal nutrition for infants for the first 6 months postpartum. Whereas
recent evidence has shown that cannabinoids transfer into human milk, there is only one preliminary study that
indicates that cannabis use may be associated with changes in milk factors and no studies that assess how
cannabis use patterns or cannabinoid concentrations in milk impact holistic milk composition. This lack of
knowledge is particularly concerning as 1) human milk is frequently the sole source of infant nutrition in the first
months of life; 2) cannabinoids are lipophilic and, given the high lipid content of the mammary gland and human
milk, both may be repositories for these compounds, and 3) delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (∆9-THC) levels in
cannabis products have increased in the past several decades, suggesting that the milk of mothers who use
cannabis and their recipient infants may be exposed to higher doses of cannabinoids than ever before. The
overall objectives of this project are to 1) characterize and compare holistic human milk composition
(metabolome, lipidome, and proteome profiles) among mothers who use cannabis and those who do not use
cannabis and 2) investigate the relationships between and among human milk cannabinoid concentrations,
maternal characteristics, cannabis use patterns, and milk metabolome, lipidome, and proteome profiles among
breastfeeding women who use cannabis. Our central hypotheses are that 1) cannabis use alters human milk
metabolome, lipidome, and proteome profiles, 2) cannabinoid concentrations in milk are related to milk
metabolome, lipidome, and proteome profiles, and 3) differences in pre- and postnatal cannabis use patterns
and selected maternal characteristics [e.g., body mass index (BMI), time postpartum] are related to variation in
milk metabolome, lipidome, and proteome profiles, even when controlling for cannabinoid concentrations in milk.
To test these hypotheses, we will compare bioarchived milk samples from 20 healthy women (≤ 6 months
postpartum) who use cannabis (≥ 1x weekly) and 20 healthy women who do not use cannabis. We will employ
a multi-omics approach to characterize and understand holistic milk composition (i.e., metabolome, lipidome,
and proteome profiles). Results from this work are expected to provide data on whether cannabis use during
lactation impacts human holistic milk composition and, importantly, constitute the foundation for a NIH R01
proposal. It also takes the initial steps toward providing mothers and healthcare providers data to enable more
informed advice and evidence-based decisions during lactation."

The objective of the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (CGC) Resource Component is to promote research on
the small metazoan Caenorhabditis elegans by curating important, genetically characterized nematode stocks
and distributing them upon request to researchers and science educators. The CGC is the sole general stock
center for the curation and distribution of C. elegans. The CGC currently houses 23,000 different strains, and
they are immensely popular: ~30,000 strains are distributed to thousands of laboratories each year, and the
majority are sent to user groups in the United States. Strains are distributed upon request through an on-line
ordering system with a scheme of user fees in place to help defray costs and support CGC activities.
Researchers in all locales supply us with important strains that they have generated. If the CGC were not
performing this curation and distribution service, strain sharing would be extremely inefficient and costly; the
burden of filling requests would be placed upon individual labs, likely leading to delays in the exchange of
research materials. Moreover, the conservation of many published strains might be in jeopardy. This would be
a great loss, because research in this model organism has led to fundamental insights into basic biological
mechanisms, including programmed cell death, axonal guidance, and the mechanism of RNA interference in
animals. C. elegans has also provided insights to mechanisms of cancer progression and neurodegenerative
diseases, and this nematode serves as a key model for illuminating the biology of parasitic nematodes, a major
health concern. In addition to enhancing research progress, the CGC Resource Component offers major cost-
savings to the NIH as a whole, to individual research labs funded by NIH, and to all other labs in the
community. These savings are achieved through decreasing redundant labor by making new mutations and
mutant combinations readily available, decreasing labor and other costs by providing an economy-of-scale
approach rather than having individual labs responsible for disseminating useful strains, safeguarding strains
made with NIH grant support through curation in redundant sites, and facilitating the use of this relatively low-
cost model by investigators working primarily in high-cost models such as mice."

The Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (CGC) seeks to enhance the efficiency with which scientists can make
biomedical research advances using a premier model organism, Caenorhabditis elegans. Analysis of transgenic
animals is an integral part of essentially all model organism research. The introduction of fluoresent protein (FP)
tags to animal models by Nobel Laureate Martin Chalfie in 1994, using C. elegans, profoundly revolutionized
transgenesis by allowing gene expression to be monitored in real time in living organisms. For genes with low
level expression, detection of fluorescent protein fusions can be challenging, driving interest in ever more bright
and photostable variations of fluorescent proteins. In addition, many applications call for multi-plexing of
fluorescently tagged proteins, increasing demand for new proteins with non-overlapping emission spectra. Thus,
development of that first green fluorescent protein has inspired discovery and design of numerous variations that
can differ in color, brightness, photostability and time to maturation. However, these characteristics can be
impacted by environmental conditions such that in vitro properties may not hold in vivo, posing a challenge for
researchers looking to expand their FP palette. When a new FP is developed with highly touted characteristics,
the in vitro characterized parameters allow selection of good candidates to test in vivo, but adoption of a new
protein by the worm community requires significant optimization and in vivo testing. This project will eliminate
uncertainties about the in vivo use of new fusion proteins for the C. elegans community by direct quantitative
comparison of a set of new FPs relative to each other and to those currently in broad use. Data derived from this
project will be used by the C. elegans community broadly to improve experimental designs for diverse research
questions, and by researchers using other model organisms to suggest the best candidate FPs to test in vivo in
their systems. This project will also result in a set of C. elegans strains expressing FPs for laboratories to test on
their own microscopes and/or on demonstration equipment they are considering for purchase. Finally, this project
will establish a set of common metrics with which to evaluate future FPs ensuring rigor and reproducibility of
testing. All strains and reagents generated in this work will be curated by the CGC and immediately available to
the community."

To enhance the rigor and reproducibility of SIV/macaque models of HIV/AIDS, it is essential to
provide specific pathogen free (SPF) macaques to the research community. The NIH/ORIP has
supported the development and maintenance of SPF macaque colonies since 2000 as a critical
biomedical research resource particularly for SIV/macaque models of HIV/AIDS. Every pigtail
macaque currently in the Johns Hopkins University SPF breeding colony meets the 4 viral agent
SPF criteria set by NIH/ORIP, testing negative for Cercopithecine herpesvirus 1 (B virus),
Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV), Simian Retrovirus (SRV) and Simian T-lymphotrophic
Virus (STLV-1). The SPF status of the JHU pigtail macaque breeding colony has been
maintained for over ten years with no breaks detected by ongoing surveillance. The Virus
Reference Laboratory (VRL, San Antonio, TX) performs all of our primate serology and PCR
assays. Under the supervision of Dr. Eric Hutchinson, core director, all of the pigtail macaques
at Johns Hopkins are tested annually by serology for the four SPF viral agents. In addition, all
colony-born infants undergo two sequential PCR tests for SRV and STLV during the first year of
life. Any rare additions to the colony from sources outside JHU are similarly tested by repeat
PCR upon arrival in JHU quarantine. Our goal is to continue maintenance of SPF status of a
valuable macaque national research resource for HIV/AIDS research. The specific aim of this
Viral Testing Core is to maintain the SPF status of the colony by regular serologic and PCR

10791301,"Project Summary
Background: High-deductible health insurance plans, which are characterized by low premiums coupled with
substantial costs for accessing medical services, are one of the most common tools for containing growing
health spending in the United States. Currently, nearly one-third of U.S. adults with employment-based health
insurance coverage—some 50 million people—have a deductible higher than $2000. In line with theoretical
predictions and intended policy goals, robust evidence shows high-deductible health plans reduce spending by
reducing medical service use. Yet, questions remain about whether these reductions come at the expense of
care valuable for patient health. These concerns are especially acute for low-income enrollees who are at
greater risk for chronic conditions. As high-deductible health plans continue to proliferate in the United States,
actionable information is needed about their impact on use of clinically valuable health care services and
whether high-deductible plans exacerbate existing income-related disparities healthcare utilization.
Objective: This project will assess the effect of high-deductible health plan enrollment on medical service
utilization and spending and how the effect varies across household income.
Methods: I use a quasi-experimental research design known as a difference-in-differences analysis to
measure outcomes among individuals before and after high-deductible plan enrollment relative to a
comparison group whose health insurance does not change. To mitigate bias caused by individual selection
into plans, I analyze the subset of individuals who enroll due to an employer-mandated switch. I perform the
analysis on a large individual-level dataset that contains detailed medical and pharmaceutical claims
information for approximately 3.1 million people with employment-based insurance who lived in a U.S. state
from 2015 to 2019. Unlike most claims datasets, the data link individuals to their census block group of
residence, a precise geographic identifier that can be merged with publicly available income data at the same
level of detail. I measure overall spending and utilization and then focus on specific bundles of services shown
to be clinically valuable for preventing or treating disease or, conversely, to have little to no value in
maintaining health, so-called low-value care. I compare results on these outcomes by income using quintiles
of the observed income distribution.
Impact: The analysis will generate policy relevant and readily translatable estimates of the effects of high-
deductible plans on health service use, including use of valuable versus low-value care, and allow for
comparison of differences across income. This project will help policymakers and public health experts better

10794071,"Amblyopia is a common disorder of neurodevelopment resulting from discordant binocular visual experience
during the first years of life, affecting 2-3% of children. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) show that current
approaches to amblyopia treatment, most often patching the fellow eye, are effective in improving visual
acuity. However, full recovery occurs in less than 50% of children. Standard-of-care patching treatment of
amblyopia is effective but suffers from poor adherence, exhibits significant individual differences in response
even when adherence is good, and fails to address the binocular dysfunction that is fundamental to amblyopia.
There is a need for an alternative approach to occlusion therapy that improves adherence to maximize visual
outcomes. Aim 1 will evaluate a novel, patch-free approach to occlusion therapy and determine whether it
results in better adherence and visual acuity outcomes compared with patching in an RCT. Our patch-free
treatment provides access to a variety of engaging activities for the child during occlusion time. Our
hypothesis is that patch-free occlusion will lead to better adherence and better visual acuity improvement than
standard-of-care patching. However, even excellent patching adherence does not ensure a good outcome;
objectively monitored patching for200 hours resulted in visual acuity improvements ranging from 0.15-0.8
logMAR. Clearly, poor adherence is not the only factor influencing visual acuity outcome—other unidentified
factors must contribute to individual differences. This argues for a personalized approach to amblyopia
treatment, choosing among a variety of effective approaches to determine which works best for each child. In
Aim 2, we propose to evaluate an alternative treatment approach based on spike-timing dependent plasticity
(STDP) to shift the modification threshold for long-term potentiation (LTP). This neuroplasticity-based
approach, prioritized in the NEI Strategic Plan, is targeted to strengthen amblyopic eye input to binocular
neurons and improve not only visual acuity but also binocular function. In an RCT, we will determine whether
this treatment results in better visual acuity and binocular outcomes compared with standard-of-care patching.
Ourproposed clinical trials include anumber of technological innovations. Our conceptual approach is novel in
that we not only evaluate vision outcomes, but also look at the effects of treatment on the whole child,
including motor skills, self-perception, and quality of life."
10794948,"Decades of evidence has found that despite the very high cost of health care in the US, older Americans
routinely receive care that is suboptimal. While there have been enormous efforts to reform health care
delivery through policy and payment reform to optimize the cost-quality tradeoff, relatively little is known about
whether these changes have achieved the goal of improving care for older Americans and, if not, how to
improve them so that they do. My current research makes innovative use of national datasets to conduct
rigorous evaluations of the impact of these policies on the care provided to older adults. In addition to its
methodological rigor, my research takes a real-world approach, evaluating outcomes that matter to both
patients and providers. To date, I have conducted high-impact research examining the effect of health care
policies on older adults, focusing in particular on improving quality measurement, evaluating whether policies
and incentives aimed at improving quality and value are effective, and assessing which aspects of these
measures and incentives work versus don't work. This research has provided practical lessons on ways to
improve quality improvement initiatives and has helped inform the planning and implementation of new
innovative delivery systems designed to improve patient care. It has also had a significant impact on clinical
practice and policy for older adults. I am to continue conducting this research. Looking forward, I aim to expand
my research program to examine the impact of health care policies and payment reform on older adults with
dementia, a group that is particularly vulnerable and may experience numerous unintended consequences
from payment reform; and to use my research program to train and mentor new investigators in the field of
improving health care delivery for older adults. Thus, the specific aims of this proposal are: (1) To conduct
high-quality research examining the impact of health care policies and delivery systems on quality of care for
older adults with chronic and complex illness, with the goal of expanding this research to examining these
effects in person with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias; and (2) To use my research as a platform to
mentor new investigators in improving health care delivery for older adults, to help them become independent
investigators and support the expansion of the field with well-trained patient-oriented researchers in aging. My
overall objective is to improve the quality of care for older adults with chronic and complex diseases.
Ultimately, my ongoing and proposed research, coupled with my mentorship program to train outstanding
investigators in the field, will help address the critical need to reform the health care delivery system to
efficiently improve quality for the millions of aging Americans who are in need of better care."

Establishment and maintenance of local immune homeostasis is essential for the integrity and function of body
barrier tissues. This process involves partnership between the tissue and the commensal microbes inhabiting
these sites. We have demonstrated that regulatory T cells (Tregs) are key to establishing immune tolerance to
skin commensal bacteria, and that type 2 conventional dendritic cells (cDC2s) are a critical, understudied
population that mediate the regulatory response to skin commensals. Specifically, our data suggest that cDC2s
capture commensal antigens more readily and prime commensal-specific CD4+ T cells more efficiently than
other DC subsets. After phagocytosing commensal bacteria, cDC2s display a mature-regulatory (mreg)
phenotype and preferentially support commensal-specific Tregs via a mechanism that may involve Myd88
signaling in DCs. The work proposed here will build on our preliminary observations to investigate how
commensal bacteria support the mreg phenotype of cDC2s and their ability to promote skin homeostasis
through commensal-specific immune tolerance. We will use engineered skin commensal bacteria mutants,
gnotobiotic and transgenic mouse models, high dimensional single cell analyses, novel tools to measure cDC2
priming of bacteria-specific CD4+ T cells and unique ex vivo systems to study human skin immune cell
function. Combining these will allow us to elucidate how host receptor pathways respond co-operatively to
bacterial ligands to promote immune homeostasis and in what manner these responses differ in skin disease,
specifically hidradenitis suppurativa. The proposed studies will use innovative approaches to define the role of
cDC2s in cutaneous immune regulation and identify the bacterial molecules and host pathways that regulate
these processes. The results will enhance our understanding of how bacteria partner to support skin
homeostasis, determine how this is altered in disease states, and inform future therapeutic strategies targeting
host-commensal interactions."

The purpose of this research is to assess the use and effects of a new generation of misleading descriptors
and imagery in combustible tobacco marketing. While regulatory efforts to date have made strides in restricting
the use of especially misleading terms in tobacco marketing (e.g., “mild”, “natural”), industry marketing has
evolved to utilize newer descriptors and imagery that are known to be associated with these restricted terms;
yet, research studying this evolution is quite limited. As the tobacco industry continues to mislead consumers
with attempts to skirt regulatory actions via implied reduced risk claims (e.g., “organic”, “tobacco and water”), it
is crucial to track their misleading marketing tactics and monitor effects on vulnerable youth and young adults
(YYAs), especially as this suggestive marketing for traditional tobacco products now exists alongside other
products actually authorized for designation as modified risk (i.e., Modified Risk Tobacco Products, or MRTPs).
Through a preliminary literature and marketing content review under Aim 1, this research will characterize
newer descriptors and imagery utilized in misleading marketing for combustible tobacco products (because
these products pose the greatest harms), focusing specifically on cigarettes and cigarillos. Aim 1 focus groups
with YYAs will assess attention, product appeal, and risk perceptions for products advertised/packaged with
these descriptors and imagery, as well as other products by the same brands and MRTPs. Results will inform a
discrete choice experiment (DCE) (Aim 2) that manipulates a series of target descriptors and images as well as
modified risk claims on cigarette and cigarillo packs, in order to isolate independent and joint effects of the
target features on product appeal and preferences. Under Aim 3, an eye-tracking study will examine young
people’s attention to ads and packs using salient descriptors and images (per focus group and DCE results),
and in combination with the prior activities, will provide preliminary data to inform research avenues for future
regulatory efforts. This K01 will support the pursuit of my long-term career goal of becoming an independent
tobacco control researcher at the intersection of tobacco policy, health communication, and tobacco misbeliefs;
it will develop my content expertise (i.e., trends in/effects of cigarette and cigarillo marketing) and cultivate new
methodological skillsets (i.e., focus groups, DCE, eye-tracking). The proposed research will allow me to work
towards research independence and an R01 grant to further study misleading tobacco marketing, with a new
focus on additional products and an emphasis on regulatory remedy."

This NIH K99/R00 proposal seeks support for the development of an independent research program aimed at
addressing the questions pertaining to perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) as a potential risk factor
dopaminergic cell loss. Polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have important usage in firefighting equipment,
nonstick cookware, carpets, etc. due to their unique capabilities to repel oil and water. These chemicals pose an
immediate environmental health threat due to their protracted half-life and ability to resist environmental
degradation, owing to its strong carbon-fluorine bond. The extensive presence and huge gaps in knowledge
pertaining to neurotoxic effects and underlying mechanisms alongside a larger percentage of sporadic cases in
major neurodegenerative disorders compel the dire need to investigate such compounds. Our preliminary
studies on PFOS in C. elegans have shown DA neurotoxicity, reduction in mitochondrial content, and increased
reactive oxygen species (Sammi et al., 2019). These effects are characteristic manifestations in Parkinson’s disease
(PD), with cause largely unknown in 90% of sporadic PD cases. In light of the preliminary data in Caenorhabditis
elegans, showing DA cell loss in response to PFOS, I will develop expertise in Induced pluripotent stem cells. A
multi-pronged approach comprising of in vivo and in vitro models will be conducted to further identify
neurotoxic and neurodevelopmental defects with a larger focus to elucidate how mitochondria and GSH extend
their role in neuropathology. Conventionally, toxicity evaluation relies heavily on end-point based studies, while
mechanistic aspects remain largely understudied. Deleterious effects of the chemicals appear over the span of
time in the form of pathologies, which is a collective result of mechanistic alterations or aberrations. Therefore,
identification of the series of biochemical events culminating in neurotoxicity is vital to define the Adverse
outcome pathway (AOP). The identified mechanisms warrant the ability to design interventions, mechanistic
assessment of similar compounds and synthesis of safer compounds. My approach consists of in vitro and in vivo
systems to elucidate the neurotoxic effects of PFOS. Information pertaining to AOPs will serve as mechanistic
endpoints/markers for comparative evaluation amongst a similar class of compounds (PFAS), facilitating
derivation of the structure-activity relationship. In summary, I will draw an in vivo, in vitro signature of PFOS
mediated Dopamine toxicity. Additionally, a detailed career development program entailing coursework,
learning new techniques/model systems, representation and attendance at scientific meetings and feedback from
the advisory committee has been constructed to help the candidate. My plan includes mentored training in
critical new techniques/model systems, combined with my existing expertise that will enable the development
of a scientific focus distinct from the mentor’s lab and promoting an independent research career."
10799864,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in men and women in Western countries, with non-
small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounting for ~85% of all lung cancer cases. Response rates to chemotherapy,
newer targeted therapies, and immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) monotherapy remain unsatisfactory and new
treatments are needed for NSCLC. Elevated levels and activation of signal transducer and activator of
transcription (STAT) 3, a transcription factor that serves as a master regulator of cancer, occur in most NSCLC
tumors and are associated with worse survival and ICI resistance mediated, in part, through the actions of
myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) in the tumor microenvironment (TME). STAT3 activation also may
contribute to ICI-mediated immune-related severe adverse events (irSAE). The Tweardy group, working with a
clinical-stage biotechnology company (Tvardi Therapeutics, Inc.), used computer-based docking and lead-
compound optimization strategies to identify TTI-101, a potent, non-toxic and orally bioavailable inhibitor of
STAT3. TTI-101 hit target and blocked tumor growth in preliminary studies using the CC-LR K-ras mutant mouse
model of NSCLC and in published studies in nude mice bearing xenografts of the LKB1-null human NSCLC cell
line, A549. A Phase 1, dose-escalation study of TTI-101 monotherapy in patients with advanced/refractory solid
tumors (NCT03195699) completed enrollment in Q3 2022 and revealed no dose limiting toxicities or fatal
treatment-related adverse events and identified a RP2D. TTI-101 administration reduced levels of activated
STAT3 within tumors by 57% and was beneficial in 21 of 39 (54%) evaluable patients, including 5 confirmed
partial responses. Based on these results, TTI-101 was granted FDA Fast Track designation and has emerged
as the most promising small-molecule STAT3 inhibitor in clinical development to treat cancer. Our long-term
translational goal is to improve outcomes in patients with recurrent or metastatic (RM) NSCLC. The main
objective here is to determine if STAT3 targeting with TTI-101 is beneficial in treatment of RM NSCLC. The
specific aims designed to achieve this objective are: 1) to determine if TTI-101 alone or in combination with anti-
PD-1 monoclonal antibody is effective in treatment of NSCLC in the K-ras mutant (CC-LR) mouse model, 2)
determine the anti-tumor efficacy and immune-modulatory effects of TTI-101 alone or in combination with anti-
PD-1 in immune-competent mouse models of K-ras and Stk11/Lkb1 (KL) co-mutated NSCLC, and 3) determine
the safety and anti-tumor efficacy of STAT3 inhibition with TTI-101 in combination with pembrolizumab (anti-PD-
1) in previously treated patients with KRAS and STK11/LKB1 (KL) co-mutated RM NSCLC in a Phase IB/II
clinical trial. We will obtain tumor biopsies pre- and post-treatment in the Phase II trial and perform correlative
studies that include determining the relationships between pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, the TME, and
clinical responses in patients and mice with NSCLC treated with TTI-101 alone or in combination with anti-PD-1
therapy. If successful, our research will improve survival and decrease toxicity in patients with RM NSCLC."

Infants born preterm are exposed to an array of morbidities. The most common cardiovascular problem
observed in this population is patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Following surgical closure of a PDA, infants can
develop Post-Ligation Cardiac Syndrome (PLCS), a serious complication which represents a state of severe
postoperative cardiopulmonary instability. PLCS can be observed in up to 50% of extremely premature infants
after surgical closure of the PDA. Recognition and treatment of PLCS often occurs late and treatment is
variable across hospitals. To date, there have been no randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) of
cardiovascular drugs to either prevent or treat PLCS in preterm infants. Given the variance in treatment of
PLCS, the potential use of harmful treatments amid suboptimal evidence or scientifically proven justification for
use, a masked, multicenter randomized trial is essential.
Preliminary data suggest that milrinone, a commonly used cardiovascular medication, reduces the risk of
PLCS in neonates requiring surgical ligation for PDA. The proposed Milrinone for Prevention of Post-ligation
Cardiac Syndrome (MIDAS) trial aims to move preliminary research forward by designing and implementing an
RCT to obtain additional data to determine efficacy of prophylactic milrinone at reducing the incidence of PLCS
and improving neonatal outcomes. We will apply the experience and rigor of the Neonatal Research Network
infrastructure in performing randomized placebo-controlled trials in union with RTI’s leadership in statistical
design and analysis and numerous prior successes in the development and implementation of RCTs. The
specific aims for the MIDAS trial are:
 • Specific Aim #1: Determine the efficacy of prophylactic milrinone on decreasing PLCS and mortality
 in extremely preterm infants, born at gestational age <27 weeks and 6 days, after PDA closure by
 surgical ligation or percutaneous cardiac catheterization.
 • Subsidiary Aim: Determine the effects of prophylactic milrinone on 2-year survival and incidence
 of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in extremely preterm infants treated with PDA
ligation.
With successful execution of these planned experimental aims, the DCC will be able to contribute toward
identification of an evidence-based approach (demonstrative of external validity and reproducibility) for the safe
prevention and treatment of PCLS in preterm infants."
10801130,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Succinate, a mitochondrial metabolite, has recently emerged as a major regulator of metabolic physiology and
inflammation. Much of this succinate-dependent signaling occurs through its release from cells and subsequent
activation of its cognate GPCR, SUCNR1. We discovered that diminished brown adipocyte activity, and the
obesogenic Western Diet, lowers succinate uptake capacity by brown fat and leads to chronic accumulation of
extracellular succinate in the liver, leading to SUCNR1-mediated tissue fibrosis and inflammation. We also
defined a succinate transport mechanism in muscle and adipose cells via plasma membrane monocarboxylate
transporter 1 (MCT1).
The major discovery of our previous grant period is that secretion of succinate from metabolic tissues can play
both protective and pathogenic roles in metabolic health, both via SUCNR1. What is unclear is which
characteristics determine whether succinate will act in pro- or anti-pathogenic manner? Therefore, in the next
stage of our project, we ask what mechanisms determine protective versus pathogenic regulation by
extracellular succinate? We hypothesize that succinate activates divergent molecular mechanisms within
specific cell types depending on length of exposure (acute vs. chronic), leading to distinct physiological
consequences. To test this hypothesis and answer the proposed question, we aim to (1) Determine the cell-
type specific consequences of acute versus chronic succinate-mediated SUCNR1 activation in the liver. (2)
Determine the intracellular, downstream mechanism of SUCNR1 activation; and (3) Investigate the MCT1-
mediated mechanism of succinate transport in the liver.
Proposed aims will address the critical gap in our understanding of the differential mechanisms that are
activated by chronic and acute exposure to succinate, a major metabolic regulator of metabolic health and
disease. Building on the critical discoveries in our initial grant period, the current proposal will define the
consequences of succinate exposure in the liver, but it is likely that similar pathways will be activated in other
tissues of interest in metabolic disorders. Therefore, our work will address how obesity and associated
pathologies develop and may lead to identification of candidates for further pharmacological development."

Select humans and animals are able to control persistent viral infections via adaptive immune responses that
include the development of neutralizing antibodies (Abs). However, the mechanisms underlying these
exceptional protective responses remain largely unknown. Using a positional cloning approach, we identified a
gene responsible for virus-neutralizing Ab responses in mice from the I/LnJ strain following infection with two
distinct retroviruses, Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus (MMTV) and Murine Leukemia Virus (MuLV). This gene is
H2-Ob (Ob), which encodes the b subunit (H2-Ob) of the ab obligate heterodimer H2-O. H2-O (DO in
humans), is a non-classical Major Histocompatibility Class II (MHCII)-like molecule and a known negative
regulator of the MHCII antigen presentation pathway. The recessive loss-of-function I/LnJ Ob allele allowed for
the production of potent neutralizing Abs in infected mice. Subsequent bioinformatics and functional analyses
of the human homologues (DOa and DOb) revealed both loss- and gain-of-function variants. Several of these
variants were genetically linked to the differential outcomes of hepatitis B and C viral infections in humans
which are controlled by neutralizing Ab responses.
 The process of loading of MHCII molecules with high-affinity, pathogen-derived peptides is mediated by
the interaction of MHCII with another non-polymorphic MHCII-like molecule, H2-M (HLA-DM in humans). H2-M
function is opposed by H2-O, which acts as an MHCII mimic, binding to H2-M and blocking its ability to
catalyze MHCII peptide loading. Importantly, our studies showed that this accepted paradigm of direct
competition between H2-O/DO and MHCII for interaction with H2-M/DM was incomplete, because at least 2
mouse Ob, as well as some human DOa and DOb variants result in H2-O/DO molecules, which bind to H2-
M/DM but fail to inhibit its function. Clearly, there are gaps in our knowledge of the mechanism by which H2-
O/DO negatively regulates MHCII presentation, a process that is central to controlling adaptive immune
responses. Using positional cloning in the mouse and a biochemical approach, novel modulators of the MHCII
pathway which have not been previously described were identified. We propose to study how these new
modulators regulate Ag presentation by H2-O to direct potent virus-neutralizing antibody responses."

Although the “master regulators” that maintain the self-renewal of pluripotent embryonic stem cells and
extraembryonic trophoblast stem cells are relatively well understood, little is known about how these
transcription factors are regulated in vivo at early stages of embryogenesis. Molecular genetics and
embryology studies have identified signaling pathways required to direct cells to become trophoblast or
embryonic epiblast, but the transcription factors that activate expression of pluripotency master regulators
(PMRs) or trophoblast master regulators (TMRs) in each cell remain largely unknown. This major gap in our
understanding of early development is due to at least two factors. First, technical barriers prevent the use of
many molecular and genomics approaches in embryos consisting of low cell numbers. Second, there are
significant discrepancies between the totipotent blastomeres of early embryos (where most PMRs and
TMRs begin to be expressed) and cell culture models of totipotent cells. Therefore, a new approach that
combines comprehensive methods for identification of regulators of PMR and TMR expression with
sensitive new methods of testing their functions in vivo is necessary to fill this major gap in our
understanding of the early embryonic gene regulatory network (GRN). We propose three aims to address
this problem. Aim 1 is focused on comprehensive identification of transcription factors regulating PMRs and
TMRs and uncovering their regulatory functions. Aim 2 will generate a lineage-resolved atlas of epigenetic
changes that occur as cells select either the epiblast or trophoblast fate, as well as identify the direct targets
of transcription factors that participate in cell fate specification. In Aim 3, we propose to dissect the
mechanisms by which developmental transcription factors help elicit these epigenetic changes and
generate a model of the totipotent GRN that mediates this decision. Successful completion of these studies
will reshape our understanding of early embryonic gene regulation, as well as specification of epiblast and
trophoblast cell fate."
10805453,"Cervical cancer is a worldwide public health problem and significant cause of mortality, with over
500,000 women diagnosed each year. Optimal curative treatment for women with locally advanced disease
calls for treatment with external beam radiation (EBRT) followed by brachytherapy. Brachytherapy allows
delivering larger dose into the tumor with interstitial catheters, which are placed into the residual tumors that
survive EBRT. The placement of these catheters, hollow plastic tubes with metal rods placed inside for
pushing through body tissue, is typically done without any guidance, and complications due to inadvertent
insertion into normal tissues (blood vessels, rectum, bladder), rather than into residual tumor, may result.
Magnetic resonance-guided brachytherapy (MRBT) has significantly improved survival and reduced
complications caused by inadvertently radiating neighboring tissues. In order to locate the catheters properly
and to calculate radiation dose, a CT is required after the MRBT. This lengthens an already complex and labor-
intensive procedure, which also suffers from imperfect methods to identify residual tumor after EBRT and
before MRBT. Identifying normal tissues as residual tumor before MRBT may result in inadvertent treatment
with radiation of healthy tissues, which increases complications. MRI multi-parametric identification of post-
EBRT residual tumor, combined with actively-tracked catheter placement into the disease as seen on MR
scanning, can result in a more precise treatment volume, and faster and more accurate MRBT catheter
placement, leading to better outcomes and reduced complications. This should increase the use of MRBT in
treating cervical cancer, as well as recurrent endometrial, vaginal, prostate, and other cancers.
 The proposed procedure utilizes several novel tools: (a) MRI sequences that map the tissue
parameters perfusion, diffusion, fibrosis and oxygenation in the post-EBRT pelvis, which are analyzed by
expert clinicians, and used to develop a method for providing refined remnant tumor maps; (b) a novel active-
obturator MRI coil which is placed in the vagina, that reduces MRI scan times by >50%; (c) flexible actively-
tracked metallic catheters, integrated with the new Elekta Venezia applicator, improving localization precision
and accelerating placement; and, (d) instantaneous intraoperative dose mapping, where catheter locations at
any time during placement are used to predict and guide what the clinician's best next move should be, such
as changing current catheter locations or adding more catheters. Together, these methods will culminate in
dose-optimized catheter placements that will lower tumor recurrence and limit radiation side effects.
 This project is a collaboration between Johns Hopkins University and Elekta Inc. JHU radiation
oncologists, radiologists, medical physicists and MRI physicists, along with a panel of experts in identifying
remnant tumor, will work jointly with Elekta engineers to develop an innovative platform with broad applications
in radiation oncology. The tools developed are validated in a 20-patient cohort of cervical cancer patients."

Sudden and unexpected infant death (SUID) occurs 2-3-fold more often among preterm infants (<37 weeks’
gestation) compared to healthy, term infants (≥ 37 weeks) and 2-fold more often among non-Hispanic Black
compared to non-Hispanic white infants. SUID rates have not changed in over 2 decades despite widespread
public health efforts targeting the general population. We conducted a national prevalence study to ascertain
adherence to American Academy of Pediatrics recommended SUID-reducing safe sleep practices (supine
sleep, room sharing but not bedsharing, and nonuse of soft bedding) among preterm infants in our R01, “Study
of Attitudes and Factors Effecting PREterm infant care Practices” (SAFE PREP; HD095060). Among 834
preterm infants recruited from 30 hospitals across the US, we found alarming rates of unsafe sleep practices at
4-8 weeks after hospital discharge, including 51% with non-supine sleep, 24% with bedsharing, and 59% with
loose objects in the sleep space. Further, non-Hispanic Black mothers had lower rates of exclusive supine
sleep compared to non-Hispanic white mothers (34% vs. 64%). We also found that attitudes about safety and
vulnerability of preterm infants and messaging and modeling behaviors by health care providers were
modifiable determinants of safe sleep practices among mothers of preterm infants. To address this urgent
problem, in this R01 renewal application, we propose a type 1 hybrid implementation-effectiveness, cluster
randomized trial, “SMART Preemie”, at 16 hospitals that participated in SAFE PREP. Leveraging our past
experience, we will conduct two safe sleep interventions specifically targeting the factors we identified in SAFE
PREP that influenced maternal decision-making about infant sleep practices: 1) a hospital-based intervention
focused on safe sleep modeling and education; and 2) a post-discharge mobile health (“mHealth”) intervention
where short, engaging videos and queries about safe sleep or shared reading (attention-matched control) will
be delivered through text messaging. We will test the effectiveness of the hospital and post-discharge mHealth
interventions individually and synergistically at changing maternal adherence to safe sleep practices by
randomizing 16 NICUs into 4 groups (4 per group): (1) Safe Sleep hospital and Shared Reading post-
discharge; (2) Shared Reading hospital and Safe Sleep post-discharge; (3) Safe Sleep hospital and Safe Sleep
post-discharge; or (4) Shared Reading hospital and Shared Reading post-discharge. In Aim 1, we will test the
effectiveness of the safe sleep interventions vs. control on adherence to safe sleep practices (supine sleep,
room sharing without bedsharing, and avoidance of loose objects) and compare effectiveness across
racial/ethnic groups. In Aim 2, we will test the extent that mediating factors identified in SAFE PREP, including
attitudes and social norms, explain intervention effects on safe sleep practices. In Aim 3, using the Procter
implementation framework, we will study key implementation outcomes, including feasibility, acceptability,
fidelity, and sustainability, which will be used for future scale-up."
10802575,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Symptoms of social anxiety rise dramatically at the transition to adolescence (ages 10-11), as peers increase in
importance. Failure to remit in social anxiety by mid-adolescence (ages 12-13) predicts increased symptom
severity, comorbid psychopathology, and diminished quality of life in adulthood. It is therefore critical to identify
factors that contribute to remittance or persistence of social anxiety during the transition to adolescence, as such
factors may serve as treatment targets. While much prior research on social anxiety persistence focuses on
threat-based processes, gold standard treatments that target these processes rarely result in remission. Thus,
there is an urgent need to develop a novel framework of investigation to identify new pathways to persistence
and corresponding intervention targets. While prominent theories suggest that biased memory for negative social
outcomes contribute to symptoms, such biases are relatively understudied in adolescent social anxiety. This
omission is significant because memory is reconstructive and fundamentally malleable, making it an ideal target
for treatment. Our preliminary data using behavior, fMRI, and neuromelanin-sensitive MRI (NM-MRI) to quantify
dopamine function, suggests interplay between dopamine system function and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)-
striatal connectivity promotes memory bias in adolescent social anxiety. Our overall goal is to apply this multi-
systems approach to the longitudinal study of adolescent social anxiety. Doing so may help identify sorely
needed biobehavioral targets for intervention during a key period of development, thereby preventing devastating
lifelong problems. To achieve this, we will assess social anxiety symptoms, dopamine system function and brain-
based functional connectivity associated with memory bias in 255 youth (10-11 years). Additional assessments
of symptom expression obtained at 6-month intervals as they transition to mid-adolescence (12-13 years) will
enable trajectory mapping. Our central hypothesis is that in the presence of high dopamine system function,
youth with biased recall for negative peer feedback and enhanced mPFC-striatal connectivity will be more likely
to persist in social anxiety versus those who remit. Specific aims are to (1) characterize longitudinal associations
between memory bias and social anxiety during a critical developmental period; (2) determine the extent to which
memory bias mediates the relation between mPFC-striatal connectivity and social anxiety symptom trajectories;
and (3) test moderation of brain-memory bias relations by dopamine system function. This proposal will advance
the field and provide novel treatment targets by characterizing the contribution of memory bias to adolescent
social anxiety persistence and remittance and its neural mechanisms. Innovative features are a focus on
understudied mechanisms (memory) in a key age (10-13 years) using multiple imaging modalities including NM-
MRI. Our project is significant because it is a critical first step towards providing the right treatment (based on
neural mechanisms) to the right youth (those who persist in social anxiety), at the right time (early adolescence,
before social anxiety becomes intractable)."

Approximately 25% of children with congenital heart disease (CHD) require intervention in the first year of life.
Although surgical mortality has decreased, the incidence of acute and chronic postoperative morbidities remains
high. Morbidities are primary drivers of hospitalization, long-term outcomes, and cost, and are most common in
children requiring neonatal surgery and those undergoing staged palliation for single ventricle heart disease
(SVHD). While our patients struggle with these morbidities daily, our understanding of the mechanisms and
molecular phenotypes of organ injury/recovery remain limited. Our preliminary data suggest that targeting a
limited number of biomarkers/pathways is insufficient to address the complicated reality of CHD. Instead,
diagnostic approaches allowing simultaneous measurement of hundreds of molecules (“omics”) paired with high
dimension data analysis techniques could represent a better strategy. Our team has been highly productive in
detailing the acute metabolomic and proteomic response to CHD surgery. We also found that the robust datasets
generated through this work provide an excellent environment for training junior researchers in data science
methods. Under this K24 proposal, we will use our two established cohorts (neonatal surgery and longitudinal
SVHD palliation) to expand beyond the acute postoperative period, exploring the systems biology of subacute
and chronic morbidity in our CHD patients. We will also leverage these high dimension datasets to train the next
generation of researchers interested in using data science techniques to improve the lives of children with CHD.
Overall Hypothesis: Postoperative injury and abnormal development following CHD surgery result in disruption
of the circulating proteome and metabolome during initial injury, repair, and longitudinal growth. Serial
measurements of the proteomic and metabolomic signature will validate novel candidate biomarkers of key
chronic morbidities and identify previously unexplored interactions among diverse molecular pathways in a
systems biology approach to understanding this complex pathophysiology.
Specific Aim 1 (New Science under the K24): Utilize proximity extension assay technology to perform
longitudinal measurement of the circulating proteome in the convalescent period after neonatal CHD surgery
and determine the proteomic phenotype/changes in targeted protein biomarkers preceding two critical
postoperative morbidities: subacute intestinal injury and chronic neurodevelopmental delay.
Specific Aim 2 (Career Development): Expand my skills in the analysis of omics and deep clinical data through
a combination of experiential and didactic training, with an emphasis on learning novel strategies to integrate
and analyze multiple streams of high dimensional data.
Specific Aim 3 (Mentoring): Using our established cohorts as a training platform, develop a pipeline of new
patient-oriented physician-scientists interested in learning and applying data science methods towards
mechanistic, diagnostic, and therapeutic discovery in children with CHD."

It is well established that biofilms are critical for the pathogenesis of many bacterial infections. More recently,
biofilms have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of intestinal diseases such as colorectal cancer and
inflammatory bowel disease, where mucosal-associated polymicrobial communities harvested from diseased
colon exacerbates disease in animal models. Despite these studies, the presence of biofilms in the intestinal
tract has been controversial. Since the mucus that lines the intestinal tract is constantly shed, the ability of this
layer to provide a stable surface for biofilm formation has been questioned. There are currently no tractable
models to understand or explore biofilm formation in the intestinal environment. As a result, evidence
supporting a role for biofilm formation in colonization of the mucosal surface is lacking. In preliminary data, we
show that deletion of the E. coli gene ntrC (∆ntrC), which encodes a regulator for nitrogen utilization, results in
increased biofilm formation in vitro and confers a 2-3 log competitive advantage over wild-type (WT) E. coli in
vivo in mice (despite reduced growth rate in vitro). These results are consistent with a role for biofilm formation
in intestinal colonization. I therefore hypothesize that competitive fitness of ∆ntrC E. coli is a reflection of biofilm
formation at the mucosal surface of the intestinal tract. The objective is to further characterize the role of
biofilm formation in E. coli colonization of the intestinal tract and to use this model system to understand more
generally the role of biofilms in disease pathogenesis at the intestinal mucosal interface. This hypothesis will
be tested through three inter-related specific aims that will determine the relationship behind biofilm formation
in vitro and spatially-localized colonization throughout the murine small intestine and colon (Aim 1), determine
the role of iron in E. coli biofilm formation and intestinal colonization (Aim 2), and characterize the biological
impact of bacterial biofilm formation in disease pathogenesis using a murine model of colitis (Aim 3). The
experiments will use various innovative approaches including the creation and inoculation of genetically-
modified E. coli strains, quantification of iron via ICP-MS in the intestinal mucus and lumen, and 16S rRNA
gene microbiota sequencing to address these physiologically-relevant mechanisms. The proposed research is
significant because it will provide new information about the bacterial determinants of biofilm formation in the
intestinal tract, with the rationale of using them for competitive niche exclusion in models of colitis. University of
Pennsylvania provides the perfect research environment to conduct this investigation given local expertise in
the inter-related fields of gut microbiome and basic microbiology. The candidate will gain experience in
compositional and functional analysis of the microbiome, acquire fundamental skills in microbial gene
engineering techniques, and broaden her knowledge base of microbiology. These skill sets will greatly
enhance the candidate's career development into an independent scientific investigator, with the long-term
goal of enabling us to better understand and modulate the effects of the gut microbiome in disease states."
10806987,"Kaposi's sarcoma (KS)-associated herpesvirus (KSHV or HHV8) is the causative agent of KS, primary
effusion lymphoma (PEL) and multicentric Castleman's disease. These tumors occur in AIDS and other
immunocompromised states. There are no specific therapies for these diseases. KS is the leading AIDS
malignancy, and is epidemic in sub Saharan Africa. KS often involves the oral cavity and can disseminate to
visceral organs. KSHV latently infects tumor cells and viral genomes persist as circular, multiple copy,
extrachromosomal, episomes (plasmids). In order to persist in proliferating cells, episomes must first replicate
and then efficiently segregate to daughter nuclei. Tumor cell viability is dependent on latent KSHV infection.
 The latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) mediates KSHV episome persistence and this function
is essential for virus survival. Therefore, LANA function is of fundamental importance. LANA represents the
Achilles heel of KSHV as its disruption is lethal to the virus. LANA is necessary and sufficient for KSHV
episome maintenance in the absence of other virus genes.
 Episome persistence is comprised of two components: 1) replication of viral DNA and 2) segregation of
the replicated episomes to progeny cell nuclei. LANA mediates both these functions. C-terminal LANA binds
specific sequence in KSHV terminal repeat (TR) DNA to mediate DNA replication. LANA tethers TR DNA to
mitotic chromosomes to segregate genomes to daughter nuclei. To form a molecular tether, the C-LANA DNA
binding domain (DBD) binds TR DNA and N-LANA simultaneously binds histones H2A/H2B at the folded
portion of the nucleosome. In addition to N- and C-LANA, internal LANA sequence is also critical for episome
persistence.
 We have discovered two distinct internal LANA regions, one comprised of unique sequence, and one
within repetitive sequence, that are critical for LANA mediated episome persistence. The unique sequence
contains three distinct functional motifs, whereas the repetitive region is homologous to a host cell “reader”
sequence. Both of these regions will be investigated in this work.
 This work will use a detailed, in depth approach to investigate each of the recently identified LANA
functional sequences. Experiments will use a rigorously developed panel of assays to identify the functional
motif and determine the mechanism through which the unique sequence mediates episome persistence. The
repetitive LANA effector sequence homologous to host “reader” sequence will be investigated to determine the
mechanism through which it exerts its function. This work will provide important insight into LANA’s
fundamental function of episome maintenance, and may lead to novel strategies to prevent or treat KSHV
associated malignancies."
10808106,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pericytes and myeloid cells cooperate with endothelium to orchestrate formation of a properly branched,
functional vessel network that sustains retinal function and thereby enables vision. Disrupted communication
between endothelium, pericytes and myeloid cells leads to excessive and pathological angiogenesis in ocular
neovascular diseases (ONDs) such as advanced age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy that
cause vision loss in millions of Americans. Excessive angiogenesis is currently treated by inhibition of a single
factor VEGF that targets endothelial cells only. In this proposal we identify a novel SLIT2-ROBO1&2 ligand-
receptor pathway that promotes retinal neovascularization through direct receptor signaling effects in pericytes
and myeloid cells. By targeting pericytes and myeloid cells, ROBO inhibition in ONDs may confer additional
benefit over VEGF inhibition of ECs alone. We will define the molecular basis of SLIT2-ROBO1&2 signaling and
its biological role in pericytes and myeloid cells to uncover novel biology controlling retinal development and
homeostasis that could be applied to OND prevention."

 Aging is the most prominent nongenetic risk factor for age-associated diseases including late onset Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) and related dementias. Accumulating evidence has implicated altered sphingolipid ceramide pathways in
aging and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the cellular and molecular basis underlying ceramide aberration and
how it contributes to aging-associated cognitive decline and AD pathogenesis remains poorly understood. Our
preliminary data revealed aging-dependent accrual of ceramides in astrocytes and, to a less extent, microglia in brain
regions known highly susceptible to aging- and AD-related functional deterioration. Lipidomic analysis of young and
aged mouse brains uncovered specific upregulation of very long chain (VLC) ceramides with concomitant decreases in
corresponding sphingomyelin molecules, suggesting aging-dependent activation of sphingomyelinase. Extracellular
amyloid beta deposition induces robust astroglial and microglial activation and ceramide production in AD as well as in a
mouse model of amyloidosis at even young ages. Moreover, we found significantly elevated acid sphingomyelinase
(aSMase) activity in AD brains compared to age matched controls. Given that elevated astroglial ceramides increase the
vulnerability of oligodendroglia to inflammatory cytokine released by microglia, that oligodendroglia/myelin damage
and/or dysfunction has increasingly implicated in AD pathology, and that ceramides abnormally accumulate in the
microglial lysosomal compartment, we hypothesize that dysregulated ceramide in glial cells is a previously unrecognized
active driver in the progression of aging-related cognitive decline and amyloid pathology. The overarching goal of this
project is to investigate cellular and molecular pathways leading to disruptions of sphingolipid ceramide homeostasis in
physiological aging and amyloidosis conditions and to identify ceramide-mediated pathogenic pathways. Specifically, we
will leverage the powerful sphingolipid targeted lipidomics and cell type-specific genetic manipulation of aSMase and
VLC ceramide synthase CerS2 to (1) determine the effect of VLC ceramide on astrocyte function and paracrine impact on
oligodendroglia and neurons including cellular damage and senescence; (2) investigate the aSMase-ceramide pathway in
regulating microglial clearance of myelin debris and amyloid beta and inflammatory activation; and (3) employ novel
conditional knockout and knockdown mice to determine the contribution of astroglial and microglial aSMase-ceramide
pathway to disease progression in a mouse AD model of amyloidosis. This project shall generate new insights into aging-
related dysregulation of the bioactive ceramide and provide a foundation for exploring the potential of interventions
targeted at sphingolipids and neuroinflammation."
10811741,"Summary
We want to improve arrhythmia therapy outcomes by predicting an optimal anti-arrhythmic drug
regimen for ventricular arrhythmia patients using genomic data and heart rhythm reports from
wearable and implanted devices. Today, amiodarone is commonly prescribed to prevent painful
shocks from defibrillators that are implanted in patients who suffer from ventricular arrhythmia.
Nevertheless, amiodarone is toxic for many patients when it is used over a period of years. In
contrast, the class 1b molecule, mexiletine has many fewer side effects, but is effective in fewer
patients. We have shown that cardiac Na+ channel variants in patients with Long QT Type 3
Syndrome can significantly affect key biophysical gating parameters that determine whether
patients respond to mexiletine therapy. We propose to apply a similar approach to determine
how common genetic variants and β-adrenergic tone regulate mexiletine response in patients
with ventricular arrhythmias. The project aims have been developed to 1) gain novel insight into
the molecular mechanisms of β-adrenergic and variant regulation of the drug response, 2)
create a predictive model by mapping parameters associated with these mechanisms to patient
response in a clinical study, and 3) improve the model by gaining insight from an optimized
induced pluripotent stem cell based model of the drug response. If the aims of the proposal are
successful, we will set the stage for a prospective clinical trial that uses a predictive model to
identify ventricular arrhythmia patients who will respond to mexiletine based on data that is
becoming readily available to physicians."

Biophysical methods, such as single-molecule techniques, quantitative imaging/spectroscopy and native mass
spectrometry (nMS) are powerful tools to gain mechanistic insights into key dynamic interactions and processes
occurring during the early and late steps of the HIV-1 lifecycle. The goal of Core 3 (Biophysics Core) is to provide
requisite instrumentation, expertise and training to augment the B-HIVE capabilities across all three center
projects by enabling cutting-edge studies of protein-protein, protein-nucleic acid and protein-membrane
interactions in living cells and in model systems. To accomplish these goals we will: (1) Provide advanced
fluorescence microscopy capabilities to visualize early and late events of the HIV life cycle (Melikian); (2) provide
advanced capabilities in single-molecule biophysics to probe dynamics of proteins, nucleic acids and their
complexes (Millar & Musier-Forsyth); and (3) provide methods for biophysical characterization of
macromolecular complexes (Musier-Forsyth and Wysocki). A critical part of the Core 3 mission is training the
users remotely or in person, through visits to the labs of the Core co-leads, workshops and videoconferences.
To accomplish this goal, the core will provide basic imaging, single-molecule and nMS services using established
pipelines to all B-HIVE projects, as needed, implement advanced techniques and engage in long-term projects
through collaborative efforts with the B-HIVE investigators, and develop novel technologies in response to the
needs of Projects 1-3.

Next-Generation Sequencing is an essential and fundamental approach in molecular virology. In vitro, it can
capture and characterize protein-nucleic interactions and RNA structure. In cell culture and in clinical settings, it
can measure rates of viral polymerase error, viral response to small molecule inhibitors or changes in host gene
expression. NGS can chart viral evolution, patterns of genome conservation, characterize origins of drug
resistance and discover new viruses. As such, NGS has been transformative in our ability to study virus diversity
and evolution and is still a burgeoning field. The Sequencing Core comprises a group of experts with experience
with the implementation of the wide range of approaches in terms of molecular biology, experimental design,
and downstream computational analyses. We will provide expert support and resources to provide Next-
Generation Sequencing and downstream computational analyses to the B-HIVE Research Projects.
Importantly, a key focus of the core will be to develop and apply approaches that go beyond what is accessible
via commercial and university core facilities. We will provide and develop state-of-the-art technologies in close
collaboration with the Research Projects that will help provide unique insights into HIV biology and evolution,
whilst also providing novel platforms for deployments in other viral systems.
A central focus of the B-HIVE is to understand the molecular mechanisms governing HIV entry, integration,
particle assembly, and egress. Each of these processes involve profiling the viral and host nucleic acids during
the viral lifecycle. The sequencing core will support the entire B-HIVE reflecting stages throughout the viral
replication cycle. We will develop single-cell sequencing approaches, leveraging our extensive expertise in this
area, to characterize the effects of integration site location, chromatin structure, HIV mutations, and exposure to
latency reversing agents (LRAs) on proviral expression. We will apply and advance long-read sequencing
technologies using the Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION platform for both host transcriptomics and full-
length HIV genome sequencing to characterize host and virus splicing. We will develop and implement novel
approaches in virus genomics to characterize virus sequence diversity in both clinical and experimental settings
in support of the main Research Projects. The Sequencing Core has extensive experience developing, deploying
and maintaining new computational software and sequencing databases. These will provide an important
resource to the B-HIVE centers, as well as allow the rapid dissemination and sharing of capabilities with the
broader HIV and virus research community. Finally, we will provide training in each of our respective platforms
and technologies in view of disseminating these skills throughout the B-HIVE and to support the development
and progression of trainees working with the B-HIVE and its collaborators.

The overarching goals of the proposed studies are to i) elucidate dynamic, multifaceted interplay between
HIV-1 and host cell that regulates infection and ii) define the virus-host interactions as therapeutic targets.
The post-fusion journey of HIV-1 across the cytoplasm and via nuclear pore complex (NPC) is regulated by
dynamic interactions of the conically shaped virus capsid shell with variety host proteins that either aid
(dependency factors) or inhibit (restriction factors) infection. However, full identity and definitions of
mechanisms of action of the cellular binding partners of HIV-1 capsid remain largely unknown. Furthermore,
it is not clear how HIV-1 has evolved so that its capsid shell can bind selectively to diverse and seemingly

characterize novel, dynamic interactions between HIV-1 capsid and host cell during virus ingress.
Specifically, our efforts will focus on uncovering previously unrecognized, dynamic networks of cellular
proteins that regulate HIV-1’s journey across the cytoplasm and through the NPC. Furthermore, we will
elucidate structural determinants for selective and avid binding of these proteins to HIV-1 capsid. The

targeting antivirals is a serious concern. In Aim 2, we will characterize interactions of existing and novel small
molecule inhibitors with distinct sites on HIV-1 capsid. Specifically, we will define how known HIV-1 capsid
inhibitors influence a dynamic structure of the conical HIV-1 capsid shell. Moreover, we will discover novel

1’s journey during the virus ingress and define these interactions as the principal therapeutic target.
Moreover, our structural and mechanistic characterization of multiple, distinct small molecule binding sites
on the conical capsid surface will provide powerful means for ongoing efforts in pharmaceutical industry to

10812451,"ABSTRACT, PROJECT 2
After infecting a cell, HIV reverse transcribes its RNA into viral DNA (vDNA) that integrates into the host cell
genome. The vDNA must enter the nucleus to access the host DNA for integration, but how the vDNA gains
nuclear entry, migrates to sites of integration, and selects sites of integration are essential yet poorly understood
steps in HIV replication. A thorough understanding of how the virus exploits host factors to complete these key
steps in replication is needed to identify promising molecular targets for development of new antiretroviral
therapies. Following nuclear import, intact viral cores are transported to interchromatin domains called nuclear
speckles where they uncoat so that the preintegration complex (PIC) can integrate the vDNA into nearby
chromatin. In Aim 1, we will identify and elucidate dynamic HIV core-host cell interactions that influence nuclear
uncoating efficiency/kinetics and the nuclear penetration distance of viral cores; we will also determine whether
the HIV core-host interactions affect genome-wide selection of integration sites using multiple synergistic
experimental approaches. The main substrate for HIV integration is chromatin and nucleosomal DNA, and
integration into transcriptionally active genes is favored by association of integrase (IN) with lens epithelium
derived growth factor (LEDGF). How HIV PICs interact with LEDGF and nucleosomes and which target sites are
favored for integration by purified assembled IN-vDNA complexes (intasomes) has not yet been determined. In
Aim 2, we will construct physiologically relevant chromatin targets of integration in vitro, define preferred regions
for viral integration into nucleosome substrates and elucidate how host factors and chromatin states modulate
integration site preferences. These directions will elucidate the mechanistic bases by which viral/host interactions
direct viral DNA integration into chromatin. It is generally thought that the chromatin state at integration sites
determines transcriptional activity or progression to latency. However, host chromatin states and viral factors that
control establishment of active or latent infection remain enigmatic. As HIV latent reservoirs reinitiate infection
upon cessation of antiretroviral therapy, they have thus far prevented development of a cure for HIV infection. We
will develop multiple experimental approaches to elucidate mechanisms that establish latent infection and
reinitiate transcription, which may promote development of latency-reactivating or latency promoting treatments
and achieve eradication or a functional cure for HIV infection. In Aim 3, We will develop multiple experimental
systems to determine the roles of IN, Tat and in vivo integration sites to examine the role of the integration site
chromatin in establishment of active vs. latent infection. Overall, these studies will provide transformative insights
into HIV uncoating, integration site selection, the molecular machinery that directs integration into nucleosomal
DNA, and elucidate the functional consequences of integration site selection on HIV transcriptional competency
and latency."

The HIV-1 structural protein Gag drives virus assembly resulting in infectious virus. During the assembly
process, Gag coordinates the incorporation of essential viral components and interacts with host factors to
facilitate virion production. The process of HIV-1 assembly is complex and choreographed, but not well
understood mechanistically and dynamically. An essential step in assembling infectious particles is the
packaging of the full-length HIV RNA genome (referred to as HIV-1 RNA hereafter). HIV-1 RNA is a minor RNA
species in infected cells and yet it is packaged into the vast majority of the viral particles. Gag must anchor in
the plasma membrane where it orchestrates particle assembly. However, the intricate interplays between Gag,
the lipid membrane components, and the viral RNA genome that govern particle assembly are not understood.
HIV-1 usurps host machinery during multiple stages of viral replication. Yet, little is known about cellular (host)
factors that are necessary for, and their roles in, Gag trafficking and virus assembly.
To study the mechanisms and dynamics of HIV-1 assembly, we have assembled an outstanding team with
complementary scientific expertise. We will use multidisciplinary approaches including biophysical methods,
structural analyses, biochemical and genetic assays, single-molecule and live-cell imaging techniques to study
how infectious viruses are assembled and the dynamics/kinetics of virus assembly. Our studies focus on three
knowledge gaps in HIV-1 assembly. In Aim 1 we will define the mechanisms whereby Gag selects HIV-1 RNA
during virus assembly by examining the interactions between Gag and viral and nonviral RNAs. We will delineate
the impact of nuclear export pathway usage on proteins that complexed with HIV-1 RNA. That Gag and host
proteins are required to facilitate viral egress is known; however, less is understood which host factors are
necessary for Gag trafficking and virus assembly. Using a novel approach, we have identified multiple host
factors that associate with Gag. Furthermore, knocking out some of these identified host genes resulted in
alteration of viral production, suggesting that they are dependency factors for assembly and/or trafficking. In Aim
2 we will elucidate how these protein dependency factors assist HIV-1 assembly and promote virus production.
In Aim 3 using single-molecule imaging approaches and molecular modeling, we will define the interplays among
Gag:lipid:RNA to provide insights into the mechanisms of virus assembly; these studies will be complemented
by examining the dynamics and kinetics of cellular HIV-1 assembly using live-cell imaging approaches.
Findings from the proposed studies will transform our knowledge of HIV-1 genome packaging mechanisms,
advance our understanding of host-viral interactions required for virus assembly, and provide insights into the
molecular mechanism of virus assembly and the dynamics of these events in T cells."
10812357,"Aggregates of lipoproteins that are tightly crosslinked to the extracellular matrix are the major type of
lipoprotein in atherosclerotic lesions. The majority of the cholesterol in these aggregates is unesterified, but it
has been unclear how the cholesteryl esters in the core of retained and aggregated extracellular LDL are
hydrolyzed – especially because a lysosomal hydrolase has been reported to be involved. Our recent studies
demonstrate a novel mechanism for the hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters in the core of retained and aggregated
LDL in which macrophages (M) create tightly sealed compartments that surround portions of the aggregated
LDL. They then acidify these compartments and secrete lysosomal enzymes into them, creating a lysosomal
synapse. It has been shown that the extracellular hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters by lysosomal acid lipase, in a
process called digestive exophagy, leads to production of unesterified cholesterol outside the cell, and
transport of this cholesterol into the cell leads to foam cell formation. The high concentrations of cholesterol in
the aggregated LDL were observed in a preliminary study to lead to the formation of extracellular cholesterol
crystals, which can cause inflammatory responses in M . The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that
this mechanism for degrading lipoproteins has significant differences as compared to conventional phagocytic
or endocytic mechanisms and that these differences have important consequences in the pathophysiology of
atherosclerosis. Furthermore, understanding this process may lead to improved therapeutic interventions.
 Work in the first aim will characterize the molecular mechanisms of digestive exophagy. This will
include a study of the Rab and SNARE proteins that are required for lysosomal exocytosis. Signaling by Tlr4,
Myd88, PI3-kinase, Akt, Syk, Vav, Cdc42, and other molecules has been shown to be important for digestive
exophagy, and the roles of additional signaling molecules will be explored.
 High concentrations of cholesterol are generated in aggregated LDL, and in Aim 2 formation of
cholesterol crystals and resulting inflammatory activation of M will be examined.
 Work in the third aim will use optical imaging and 3-D electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) to examine the
3D structures of lysosomal synapses in a mouse atherosclerosis model. Formation of lysosomal synapses,
association of cholesterol crystals with retained and aggregated LDL, and inflammatory activation will be
studied in various mouse models of atherosclerosis by optical microscopy.
 Better understanding of the cellular and molecular events occurring in atherosclerotic lesions can lead
to better risk assessments and potentially new therapies."

This K01 award is to provide Dr. Pierre Cunin with the advanced research training, protected time, and
mentoring needed to become an independent investigator specialized in intravital 2-photon microscopy and
committed to understanding the role of megakaryocytes as a direct modulators of immunity.
Candidate: Dr. Cunin is an Instructor in Pediatrics at Harvard Medical School (Boston MA), in the laboratory of
Dr. Peter Nigrovic in the Division of Immunology at the Boston Children’s Hospital. Dr Cunin’s previous training
has provided him with extensive knowledge in the biology of human and murine immune cells, as well as a
technical expertise in cellular immunology, molecular biology, biochemistry, and murine experimentation.
Research: Dr. Cunin’s K01 project seeks to understand the function of emperipolesis (EP), a cell-in-cell
interaction wherein a neutrophil transits through the cytoplasm of a megakaryocyte. Routinely observed in
bone marrow from all species examined, EP had never been investigated in depth experimentally. Dr. Cunin
found that EP increases in arthritis and other forms of systemic inflammation, suggesting a role in disease. He
previously reported that EP is an active and highly regulated process that mediates bi-directional transfer of
proteins and membrane between neutrophils and megakaryocytes. Preliminary data show that this exchange
has important physiological consequences for neutrophil function. Dr. Cunin will evaluate how EP modulates
the immune function of neutrophils in health and with inflammation. Finally, Dr. Cunin will identify ways to
manipulate EP via targets on neutrophil or megakaryocyte, opening up the possibility of therapeutic targeting.
Mentoring/Training: The long-term goal of the PI is becoming an independent investigator and tenured faculty
member at a leading academic center. The proposed studies and training plan will set the stage for Dr. Cunin
to obtain independent R01 funding and become an internationally recognized leader at the cutting-edge of the
exploration of megakaryocytes as immune cells, as well as of the pathological role of this lineage in
autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. With his appointment as Director of the 2-photon facility in the
Division of Immunology at BCH, he will become an expert in intravital imaging to observe immune cells
behaviors in their organs, in healthy animals or subjected to inflammation. His research training will encompass
in vivo cell visualization and live cell analysis, animal surgery, and bioinformatics for RNA sequencing.
Additionally, he will learn laboratory leadership skills to facilitate the transition to his own laboratory. The work
will be performed in a superb institutional environment with the mentorship of Dr. Peter Nigrovic, an expert in
myeloid biology and inflammatory diseases, Dr. Italiano, an expert in megakaryocyte biology, as well as an

Parasite infection with members of the class Kinetoplastea, including Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania spp.,
places a tremendous burden on human health, with an estimated ~1.4 million cases of disease recorded in 2015
(World Health Organization). Despite the widespread impact of these organisms, there remain major gaps in our
understanding of fundamental parasite biology. For example, it is appreciated that glucose is a critical metabolite
that can also serve to regulate important developmental pathways in the parasites. However, our understanding of
these areas, particularly in the context of living parasites, is extremely limited.
We propose to elucidate key mechanistic aspects of kinetoplastid glucose metabolism in kinetoplastids using a
validated, yet unprecedented, screening assay platform based on live parasites expressing protein sensors that
measure glucose uptake, distribution, and metabolism. We will adopt these cells to a novel and effective
multiplexed high-throughput screening assay to identify small molecule probes that disrupt glucose uptake,
distribution and metabolism in live parasites. This unique approach will simultaneously identify inhibitors of
glycolysis that possess chemical properties required for delivery to the cellular target. Hits from the screening of a
structurally diverse 100,000 compound collection will be validated by resynthesis, reconfirmation and counter-
screening. Target identification, which will be facilitated by mapping the impact of the inhibitor on the pathway
using the read-out from the assay, will be confirmed using reverse genetic and proteomic approaches. Last, the
identified small molecule glycolytic probe inhibitors will be improved by SAR and their activity against parasites
scored. Expected outcomes include development of a screening strategy that will be applicable to many types of
cells, along with the identification of validated probes that dissect an essential parasite metabolic pathway."

Parasite infection with members of the class Kinetoplastea, including Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania spp.,
places a tremendous burden on human health, with an estimated ~1.4 million cases of disease recorded in 2015
(World Health Organization). Despite the widespread impact of these organisms, there remain major gaps in our
understanding of fundamental parasite biology. For example, it is appreciated that glucose is a critical metabolite
that can also serve to regulate important developmental pathways in the parasites. However, our understanding of
these areas, particularly in the context of living parasites, is extremely limited.
We propose to elucidate key mechanistic aspects of kinetoplastid glucose metabolism in kinetoplastids using a
validated, yet unprecedented, screening assay platform based on live parasites expressing protein sensors that

10812378,"Project Summary
This laboratory has previously developed a technique for transplanting pancreatic islets as part of a composite
islet-kidney (I-K), in which autologous islets are placed under the kidney capsule of the donor animal 6 to 8
weeks prior to transplantation. During this time, the islets become vascularized, so that there is no period of
ischemic damage to the islets when the I-K is subsequently transplanted to a recipient animal. There is also no
damage due to an immune response during this period, since the islets are autologous. We have demonstrated
the advantages of this technique over free islet transplantation for successful allogeneic islet transplantation,
both in miniature swine and in non-human primates. However, the applicability of this approach to clinical islet
transplantation is limited by the requirement for 6 to 8 weeks for vascularization, since this requirement limits the
approach to living donors. Extension of the approach to I-K xenotransplants could eliminate this limitation,
providing a cure for the currently unmet needs of many patients with end-stage diabetic nephropathy. Until
recently, however, the survival of xenograft kidneys was too short and the immunosuppression required too great
for the approach to be considered as a viable clinical option. Our recent studies now suggest that long-term
survival of porcine kidneys in baboons is possible using miniature swine donors and a tolerance-inducing
approach. The goal of this project is therefore to develop a clinically relevant tolerance induction strategy
for pig-to-baboon I-K transplantation. Specifically, we will: 1) Combine IK technology with our mixed
chimerism tolerance-inducing approach to determine whether tolerance of kidney extends to porcine islets and
reverses diabetes; 2) Combine IK plus VTL technologies to determine whether tolerance of kidney extends to
porcine islets and reverses diabetes; and 3) Compare and contrast mixed chimerism and VTL approaches with
regard to mechanism of tolerance to kidney and islets antigens. If successful, our approach could overcome the
current limitations to treatment of this clinically important entity by providing a virtually limitless donor supply of
islets and kidneys, a tolerance approach to avoid the need for long-term, chronic immunosuppression and a
donor kidney from inbred miniature swine, with intrinsic capacity to attain a size similar to that of human
recipients."
10812381,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Mutational signature analysis is a recent analytical approach for interpreting somatic mutations in the genome.
It utilizes the sequence context of point mutations as well as the size and type of copy number and structural
aberrations to decompose the observed mutational patterns into distinct 'signatures', some of which have been
associated with speciﬁc biological processes. In this project, we will develop more robust and sensitive com-
putational methods for mutational signature analysis and apply them to several clinically important questions.
Our initial work has attracted a great deal of attention from clinicians, and we will analyze data from several
clinical cohorts in close collaboration. In Aim 1, we will build upon our previous work to devise a method
that can identify homologous recombination deﬁciency in cancer patients proﬁled on gene panels. Although
whole-genome sequencing offers several advantages, gene panel sequencing remains as a pivotal platform in
clinical care. Our method will enable signature analysis for gene panels from which only a small number of
mutations can be observed. We will incorporate additional sources of information and identify biomarkers for
patient stratiﬁcation. In Aim 2, we will investigate other types of genomic instability such as mismatch repair
deﬁciency, replication stress, and APOBEC mutagenesis. For example, although patients with mismatch repair
deﬁciency generally respond better to immunotherapy, there is a considerable variation across patients. We
will use mutational signatures to identify a subset of patients that respond better. In Aim 3, we will extend our
method to data from circulating tumor DNA and single cell RNA sequencing to enable signature-based predictive
modelling. In Aim 4, we will develop a generalized analytical framework for whole-genome and whole-exome
signature analysis that will overcome the shortcomings of current approaches. We will use this new framework to
build a high-quality reference catalog for the community."
10812383,"Summary/Abstract
 Micro-ribonucleic acids (miRNAs) are crucial for normal lung development, lung health, and have been
implicated in lung diseases, including Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). In addition, recent
studies have identified miRNAs as potential therapeutic targets for COPD. miRNAs play an important role in
gene regulation. miRNAs act within a complex regulatory structure that involves other biological molecules,
including transcription factors, proteins, messenger RNAs (mRNAs), and other epigenetic mechanisms, all of
which may be under the influence of genetic variants. A number of genetic variants have been identified as
important for COPD through Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS). However, substantial computational
and methodological challenges impede both linking genetic variants to altered molecular mechanisms and
identifying therapeutic interventions that can effectively target these mechanisms for clinical impact.
Understanding the complex structure of gene regulation, including by and of miRNAs, and how it is altered in
disease or in response to a genetic variant, is critical for developing effective, precision-medicine based
therapeutic strategies in COPD.
 In this project, we hypothesize that network-based methods, which model the collective response of biological
molecules, have the potential to identify novel therapeutic strategies for COPD. Our goal is to leverage the
predictions made by regulatory network models in a Connectivity Map analysis to identify potential therapeutic
interventions for COPD. To accomplish this goal, we will first develop a network approach to model regulation
by and of miRNAs using existing mRNA and miRNA expression data from blood samples in COPDGene. We
will also generate miRNA expression data in lung tissue from the Lung Tissue Research Consortium (LTRC).
We will use these data to assess changes in miRNAs related to COPD and to quantify associations between
miRNAs and genetic variants. Co-expression, regulatory, and genetic-association networks will be developed to
support multi-Omics predictions relevant to COPD. Network analysis results will be analyzed in the context of
drug response profiles from the Connectivity Map to identify potential treatment strategies. The outcome of this
project will be a deeper understanding of the regulatory role of miRNAs in COPD, how disease-specific miRNA
regulation is altered in the context of COPD GWAS variants, and predictions for novel therapeutic strategies for
COPD. The methods developed in the project will also support the broader goal of developing precision-medicine
strategies for COPD."
10815712,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Oral cancers have the seventh highest incidence, with roughly 51,540 new cases and 10,030 cancer-
related deaths expected to occur in 2018. Although a variety of treatment methods are available, the death rate
is higher than that for most cancers with five-year rates of about 50 percent. The most frequently used
treatment method, glossectomy surgery, involves the surgical removal of tumors and surrounding tissues, and
the addition of grafted tissues, often followed by radiotherapy. Although tongue cancer and its treatment have
debilitating effects on speech, the impact of varying degrees of resection and reconstruction on the formation
of functional units in speech has remained poorly understood. In order to produce intelligible speech, a variety
of local muscle groupings of the tongue—i.e., functional units—emerge and recede rapidly and nimbly in a
highly coordinated fashion. Therefore, understanding the formation of functional units that are critical for
speech production can provide substantial insights into normal, pathological, and adapted motor control
strategies in controls and patients with tongue cancer for novel therapeutic, surgical, and rehabilitative
strategies. One of the critical challenges in pre-operative surgical and treatment planning, as well as in post-
operative evaluation for tongue cancer is the difficulty in developing objective and quantitative measures and in
evaluating their functional outcome predictability. To address this, in this proposal, three integrated approaches
will be used in in vivo tongue motion during speech to seamlessly identify the functional units and associated
quantitative measures: multimodal MRI methods, multimodal deep learning, and biomechanical simulations.
This will provide a convergent approach, thereby allowing us to (1) test hypotheses about the spatiotemporal
basis of muscle coordination in a consilient way, and (2) develop objective quantitative measures that are
required for understanding the complex biomechanical system as well as for predicting the functional outcomes
after various reconstruction methods. The first proof of concept study published by the PI and the team
identified the functional units of speech tasks using the sparse non-negative matrix factorization framework, in
which the magnitude and angle of displacements from tagged MRI were used as our input quantities. With
these advances in place, we will further incorporate muscle fiber anatomy from diffusion MRI and motion
tracking from tagged MRI into our framework to yield physiologically and anatomically meaningful functional
units. In addition, we will create a completely novel and integrated way of directly relating the functional units to
tongue muscle anatomy, learning joint representation via a multimodal deep learning technique, and linking
them to biomechanical simulations. Furthermore, 3D and 4D atlases will be utilized to identify objective and
quantitative measures based on our functional units analysis. Taken together, the successful implementation of
our integrated framework will identify functional units that can be used for research on tongue motion, for
surgical planning, and for diagnosis, prognosis, and rehabilitation in a range of speech-related disorders."
10815713,"This proposal requests support for the second renewal of a highly successful, integrative pre-doctoral training
program in the neuroscience of drug abuse at Indiana University Bloomington. Despite substantial advances in
understanding drug addiction within specific levels of analysis (e.g., behavioral, clinical, and molecular), the
problem of drug abuse will not be solved by focusing on a single level of analysis. If the next generation of
researchers is to make meaningful progress, they must be well-rounded scientists with an appreciation that
drug abuse is a multi-faceted problem, while possessing the flexibility to respond to and incorporate rapidly
evolving technologies that will enable them to understand mechanisms and develop treatments for drug abuse.
To prepare trainees for success in the next decade and beyond, our program emphasizes a team-driven, inter-
disciplinary approach based on the translational model. Our program is successful because it brings together
12 core faculty members who are committed to integrative training and have a long history of collaboration on
questions integral to drug abuse research. They include senior and junior investigators, molecular
neurobiologists, cognitive neuroscientists, epidemiologists, and clinical scientists. They come from several
departments in the College of Arts and Sciences and the School of Public Health, and all have joint
appointments in the campus-wide Program in Neuroscience. Working together in state-of-the-art facilities, this
group has access to a pool of highly talented trainees motivated to pursue careers in drug abuse research. Our
training program develops trainees by emphasizing three key components: integrative course work,
translational research training, and professional skills development. Course work covers basic neuro- and
psychopharmacology, provides an integrative view of biobehavioral processes in substance use disorders, and
brings a translational perspective to theoretical and empirical knowledge. Research is guided by a mentor in
molecular, systems, cognitive, or clinical neuroscience closely integrated with a co-mentor representing a
complimentary level of analysis. This integrative approach is reinforced through discussion groups, attendance
at colloquia, and participation at national meetings. Instruction in ethical scientific behavior includes formal
course work and campus workshops as well as specialized instruction led by a core faculty member who has
many years of experience leading seminars on ethical issues unique to substance use research. Trainees also
learn to develop skills in grant writing, manuscript preparation, teaching, and community outreach and organize
an annual program retreat with outside experts in drug abuse. In short, our program relies on a combination of
course work and research training aimed at integrating and translating bench and bedside approaches to
produce scientists well prepared for productive and transformative careers in drug abuse research."
10814865,"ABSTRACT: Mechanistic Basis of Calcium Sensing Receptor Signaling
The calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) is the master regulator of calcium metabolism in human and represents
an outstanding drug target for the treatment of parathyroid disorders that develop in patients with chronic kidney
diseases (CKDs). For patients with renal disfunction that develop hyperparathyroidism, calcimimetic drugs that
act as positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of the CaSR are the favored therapeutics. PAMs, such as cinacalcet,
evocalcet and etelcalcetide, are approved treatment for CKD; however, their clinical use is limited due to their
adverse side effects. By elucidating the dynamic structural mechanisms of receptor activation, its modulation by
small-molecule modulators, and the specificity of G protein activation, we seek to understand in detail the CaSR
signaling mechanism and enable the rational design of improved therapeutics modulating receptor function.
CaSR is a family C member of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which also include the metabotropic
glutamate receptors (mGlus) and the metabotropic gamma aminobutyric acid receptor (GABAB). Like other
members of this family, CaSR functions as an obligate homodimer with an N-terminal extracellular domain (ECD)
responsible for ligand binding, linked to the seven-transmembrane (7TM) domain. We have recently determined
cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) structures of the near-full-length human CaSR homodimer in active and
inactive states, revealing how ECD rearrangement upon Ca2+ binding induces the activation of the 7TMs and
how allosteric modulators engage the receptor. Our results illustrate an essential asymmetry in the active state
where each CaSR protomer is stabilized by a PAM molecule bound to each 7TM in two distinct conformations
leading to the activation of only one transmembrane region, priming it for G protein coupling. Here we propose
to extend these studies in order to characterize the mechanism and specificity of G protein activation by CaSR,
its dynamics, as well as the detailed action of allosteric modulators with distinct pharmacological interest.
Specifically, we seek to apply: structure-based mutagenesis coupled with cell signaling assays that monitor the
effects of allosteric modulators; cryoEM structural studies of CaSR alone and in complex with allosteric
modulators and distinct G proteins in a near native lipid environment; and single-molecule fluorescence
resonance energy transfer (smFRET) complemented by double electron-electron (DEER) spectroscopy to reveal
the dynamics of receptor and G protein activation as well as its modulation by different allosteric ligands.
Collectively, the proposed structural, cellular, biochemical and biophysical experiments aim to provide a full
mechanistic framework for transmembrane signaling by CaSR and will guide the future development of novel
drugs targeting this receptor."

Most stroke survivors present with gait dysfunction resulting in reduced community participation and quality of 
life. A promising rehabilitation intervention for mitigating post-­stroke gait deficits is the combination of fast 
walking and functional electrical stimulation (FastFES). Dr. Trisha Kesar (primary mentor) is currently leading 
an NIH funded R01 comparing the long-­term effects (18 sessions and up to 12-­week follow-­up) of FastFES 
versus conventional Fast on walking function and corticospinal excitability. Despite its promise, FastFES, like 
virtually all gait interventions, faces the problem of variation in individual response to treatment. 
Neurophysiological testing takes aim at the root of this problem by exploring the neural mechanisms underlying 
each individual’s unique response. Because neuromotor circuit plasticity is a core component of treatment 
response, quantifying this adaptation potentially provides a means for identifying likely responders and non-­
responders early in the treatment process. A promising tool for non-­invasively assessing changes in 
corticomotor excitability is transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). In fact, TMS response has already been 
correlated with retention of functional improvement in other post-­stroke motor interventions. However, whether 
TMS-­derived measures correlate with response to Fast or FastFES training is unknown. Additionally, TMS-­
induced measures do not differentially account for changes at the spinal reflex circuit or the motoneuron level, 
which can be evaluated by measuring H-­reflexes in response to peripheral nerve stimulation, another non-­
invasive technique that can probe spinal circuit neuroplasticity. Thus, I propose to gather additional TMS and 
H-­reflex data prior to and following the first training session in Dr. Kesar’s parent R01 study, which will be 
compared to biomechanical changes during and at 48-­hours following (retention) the training, to test the 
hypothesis that baseline corticomotor and spinal excitability, as well as training-­induced acute neurophysiologic 
responses to Fast and FastFES are associated with locomotor learning of biomechanical improvements. 
Finally, corticomotor or spinal circuit changes in response to a single intervention do not indicate whether an 
individual who exhibits a ‘response’ or non-­response to the treatment does so due to poor intervention 
matching or a generalized decrease in neuroplasticity capacity. Thus, I propose a baseline measurement of 
individual responses to paired associative stimulation (PAS), a non-­invasive method to quantify an individual’s 
capacity for neuroplastic change. We hypothesize that baseline PAS response will be associated with 
biomechanical and neurophysiological response to the gait treatment. In addition to providing novel insights 
into neural correlates of acute responses to stroke gait training, this F31 project will provide the PI valuable 
training in collection, processing, and interpretation of neurophysiologic data under the supervision of an elite

10932406,"Methamphetamine, HIV integration and latency in the brain
 Methamphetamine (Meth), a stimulant drug used by people with HIV (PWH
pathways in addiction, aggravating effects of HIV in the brain, where reservoir cells bearing HIV integrated
provirus challenge cure strategies and contribute to perpetuating neurological consequences, despite
), influences inflammation and
antiretroviral treatments (ART).
Neurotransmitters involved in addiction such as dopamine (DA) modulate HIV
targets that express DA receptors, including the microglia diverse population. Chromatin organization in HIV-1
integration represents an important prerequisite for understanding infection and latency. However, there is a
critical gap in understanding relationships between chromatin organization and proviral integration associated
with HIV-1 persistence in microglia cellular reservoirs, and particularly in the best experimental model, the SIV-
rhesus macaque. Moreover, it is unknown how Meth modifies these relationships. We hypothesize that Meth
impacts chromatin enhancing viral integration susceptibilities in HIV/SIV brain target cells, and that effects vary
by brain region that differ in dopaminergic projections.
Critical to this goal is the progression of models reflected
in phases, first in vitro using human microglia cell lines and iPSC-derived, where the characteristics of HIV
integration have been defined, and effects of Meth, or DA, can be controlled. This is followed by models ex vivo
and in vivo in the SIV-rhesus macaques, to replicate HIV, chronic Meth and ART-suppression. In the R61 phase,
we will concentrate on whether chromatin accessibility and the architectural protein CTCF, which interacts with
LEDGF/p75 to tether the HIV-1 Integrase, mediate insertions into genomic boundaries of topologically associated
domains (TADs), modified by Meth, or DA. We will assess the impact of integration patterns on the integrity of
proviral genomes to gain insights about the real size of the functional viral reservoir. Aim 1) delineates
relationships between epigenomic changes in microglia upon Meth and proviral genomes inserted into the pre-
established regions with marked presence of CTCF and H3K36me3 (TAD boundaries), Aim 2) connects
epigenetic profiles and HIV-1 insertion patterns with the cellular and viral transcription profiles, while confirming
these rules in the SIV system, and Aim 3) determines the contribution of DA. Go-No-Go: If epigenomic changes
caused by Meth or DA are linked to integration sites, with similar rules in all models, the R33 phase will move to
the in vivo SIV model, to test effects of Meth chronic use on epigenomic vulnerabilities to SIV integration in
microglia, in relation to subset heterogeneity in mesolimbic areas where DA projections are abundant compared
to control regions of the brain. Aim 4) tests whether SIV integration site availability follows rules dictated by
chromatin states, accessibility and CTCF binding that can be used to predict susceptibilities in the context of
Meth. Aim 5) tests whether integration susceptibilities and patterns vary in brain areas that differ in dopaminergic
projections, and heterogeneous microglia populations. This project enables novel studies on microglia chromatin
and SIV integration dynamics in brain areas that differ by function, cellular density, and neurotransmitters."
10816474,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Electrocardiographic QT interval, an index of ventricular repolarization, is a clinically relevant heritable
quantitative trait associated with risk for cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (SCD). Genetic studies
in subjects with rare Mendelian long- and short-QT syndromes have identified rare, severe coding mutations in
~20 genes encoding voltage-gated ion channels, transporters and associated proteins that regulate cardiac action
potential duration (APD) or excitation-contraction (EC) coupling. Prevalence of coding polymorphisms in these
genes affecting population repolarization variability is extremely low. In contrast, genome-wide association
studies (GWAS) of QT interval in the general population have identified common, noncoding variants at nearly
three dozen loci, collectively explaining ~20% of the additive variance. Nearly half of these GWAS loci harbor
genes known to regulate cardiac APD or EC coupling, thus serving as the likely causal genes. Nonetheless, the
identities of the actual causal genes and molecular mechanisms underlying associations with the common and,
largely noncoding variants at these loci, remain unknown. Moreover, a large fraction (~80%) of the additive
variance remains unidentified. Leveraging information on known genes, in the proposed studies we will address
these gaps in our knowledge based on the hypotheses that a) multiple common variants that impact the activities
of several cis-regulatory elements (CREs) underlie a GWAS signal by collectively influencing the expression of a
target gene, and b) genes underlying specific or similar diseases/traits are often functionally related, and that
functionally related genes often belong to gene regulatory networks (GRNs), members of which are co-regulated.
We aim to functionally characterize selected QT interval GWAS loci with a priori evidence for likely causal genes
as well as extend gene discovery by assessing the impacts of perturbing the expression of known QT interval
genes on their GRNs. Our specific aims are: (1) identification of functional CRE variants at selected QT interval
GWAS loci by evaluating all trait-associated common variants overlapping cardiac open chromatin regions in
high-throughput reporter assays in mouse cardiomyocyte HL1 cells; and to link CREs and their variants to
putative target genes based on expression quantitative trait locus and chromatin contact analyses in human adult
left ventricle tissue and induced pluripotent stem cells-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs); and (2) performing
CRISPR activation/interference-based expression perturbations of selected QT interval genes in neonatal rat
ventricular myocytes (NRVMs), and assessing transcriptome-wide effects to identify candidate co-regulated gene
sets; evaluating the co-regulated gene sets for enrichment in sub-threshold GWAS loci; overlapping co-regulated
genes with QT GWAS loci to identify likely causal genes; and assessing the impact of perturbing expression of
newly identified genes on cellular electrophysiology in NRVMs and hiPSC-CMs. Together, the proposed studies
are expected to lead to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying QT interval variation
and SCD risk, and serve as a model for functional characterization of GWAS loci of complex diseases and traits."
10816477,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 A cornerstone of treatment uniformly recommended for individuals with bipolar disorder (BD) is mood
stabilizing medication. However, approximately one in two individuals with BD are non -adherent with medication,
often leading to severe and negative consequences. Unfortunately, there is no widely used evidence-based
approach to target poor adherence in BD.
 Customized Adherence Enhancement (CAE), developed by this study team, is a brief, practical BD -specific
approach that identifies individual adherence barriers and then targets these areas for intervention using a
flexibly-administered modular format. A prospective, 6-month, randomized controlled efficacy trial (RCT) of CAE
vs. a rigorous control, BD-specific education (EDU) found that medication adherence and functional status were
improved in CAE vs. EDU for poorly-adherent patients. Remarkably, the benefits of CAE occurred in individuals
who had been living with BD, on average, for over 2 decades. While promising, the original efficacy RCT was
limited by the fact that it was performed in an academic medical center, did not make use of existing web/text
messaging technology, and did not address potential challenges to scale -up in standard clinical settings.
 In response to PA-18-722 “Improving Patient Adherence to Treatment and Prevention Regimens to Promote
Health”, this Type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation project will adapt CAE for use in community/public-
sector care settings, test effectiveness in high-risk, poorly adherent individuals in these settings, and gather
evidence on barriers and facilitators to implementation of the intervention in order to inform subsequent scale-
up. The project will examine putative mechanistic engagement targets suggested by previous work and include
implementation elements that will inform future dissemination should findings be positive. The project will be
implemented in 4 specific aims: 1) Refine the CAE intervention guided by stakeholders at a community mental
health clinic (CMHC) and a safety-net county healthcare system, 2) Test the effectiveness of technology-
facilitated CAE vs. enhanced treatment as usual (eTAU) using a prospective, 2-site RCT, 3) Test the effects of
CAE vs. eTAU on functional status in poorly adherent individuals with BD, and 4) Identify barriers and facilitators
to CAE implementation in order to inform subsequent scale-up and spread using qualitative methods and guided
by implementation conceptual models. Additional exploratory analysis will assess whether changes in patient-
level adherence barriers and facilitators mediate the treatment effects on adherence. Finally, the project will
evaluate on-site (outpatient visits, no-show rates) and off-site (emergency department visits, hospitalizations)
health resource use to help characterize relative value and inform future sustainability efforts. An over-arching
goal of this project will be to provide a curriculum-driven adherence enhancement approach that can be
implemented in public-sector care settings and which can improve outcomes for the most vulnerable groups of
people with BD."

partnership with the Clinical and Data Management and Statistical Cores established the Consent-to-Contact
(C2C) Registry, which is an efficient tool to translate outreach efforts into study recruitment. The C2C Registry
now includes more than 2000 individuals who have provided extensive demographic, clinical, and lifestyle data
that enable prioritized recruitment of individuals most likely to qualify for studies. C2C registrants indicate
willingness to participate in research procedures, further enhancing the efficiency of recruitment. To date, the
C2C Registry has referred more 150 participants to the Clinical Core UDS study, clinical trials, and other AD

Project Summary/Abstract
Genome wide association studies have identified almost 30 genes that are associated with altered risk of
developing late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). Yet, precisely how those genes impact the function of human
cells to either promote or protect against the development or progression of AD remains unclear. One
promising approach that is increasingly being used to examine such questions involves the use of induced
pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which can be generated from control and AD subjects and then differentiated
into the key brain cells implicated in AD. In 2013, the UCI Alzheimer's disease research center (ADRC)
became the first ADRC to establish an induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (iPSC) Core. Since then, the core has
generated and provided iPSC lines from AD, MCI and control subjects to researchers around the world who
are using these lines to examine the impact of AD genes on human cellular function. In the current application,

Adaptive Motif-Based Control (AMBC): A Fundamentally New Approach to Automated Treatment
Optimization for Type 1 Diabetes
Automated Insulin Delivery (AID) has transitioned to the clinical practice and one of the most advanced systems
to date –Control-IQ (Tandem, Inc.)– is based on the UVA-AID, developed and tested by our team. Following two
pivotal trial in adults and children with type 1 diabetes (T1D), both published in the New England J of Medicine,
the system was cleared by the FDA and European regulatory agencies, and is now in use worldwide. With this
clinical translation now accomplished, our academic objective is to design and test next-generation AID solutions.
 The key innovative concept behind the new Adaptive Motif-Based Control (AMBC) class of AID algorithms
 proposed here, is the ability to learn from a user’s past glycemic-control patterns and from population patterns,
and optimize this user’s treatment in real time; thus, unlike any other AID system, the AMBC will utilize both a
person’s own history and the history of others, to forecast glycemic changes and adapt AID action accordingly.
To achieve its goals, the AMBC will employ: (i) a newly discovered fundamental structure underlying the multitude
of possible daily continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) profiles in diabetes, which allows classification of these
profiles into a finite number of basic “motifs”, and (ii) a new Adaptation-to-Profile treatment optimization process.
To test the AMBC, we propose a pilot study, followed by a randomized cross-over trial enrolling 90 participants
with T1D and Control-IQ experience, to compare the UVA-AID (as built in Control-IQ) to 3 treatment modalities:
AMBC with meal and exercise announcements; AMBC-A without meal or exercise announcements, i.e. a “full
closed-loop,” and an intermediate AMBC-EA which will have meal but no exercise announcement. Participants
will be randomized to two groups following different sequences of treatment modalities: UVA-AID-->AMBC-
A-->AMBC-EA-->AMBC and AMBC-->AMBC-EA-->AMBC-A-->UVA-AID. Each treatment modality will continue for
5 weeks. This time-tested design enables four crossover comparisons, which will test the following hypotheses:
(1) AMBC with meal/exercise announcements will be superior to UVA-AID in terms of time in the range 70-
 180mg/dl and reduced incidence of hypoglycemia (measured by CGM), and technology acceptance;
(2) AMBC-A without meal/exercise announcements will be non-inferior to UVA-AID in terms of time >180mg/dL
 during the day, incidence of hypoglycemia during and after exercise, and postprandial glucose variability;
(3) Deescalating AMBC-->AMBC-EA-->AMBC-A vs escalating AMBC-A-->AMBC-EA-->AMBC deployment of
 meal and exercise announcements will have no influence on the outcome within each treatment modality.
Overall, we affirm that reliable technology has been developed and sufficient data accumulated to warrant the
development of a new class of AID algorithms – AMBC – which is expected to become the first AID system
learning from a user’s own historical metabolic patterns and from the patterns of others structured in a new
relational data library. We view the AMBC as a paradigm for transition from hybrid to full (no announcements)
AID, but do not claim that the AMBC is a full closed-loop system."
10817130,"Does Senescence Impair the Cardiovascular Benefits of Menopause Hormone Therapy?
 Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) causes approximately one-third of all deaths
worldwide. The protection in women against ASCVD is reduced with aging and menopause. Menopausal
hormone therapy (MHT) has not replicated this protection in postmenopausal women in clinical trials,
highlighting the gap in our knowledge of the mechanisms of the protecting roles of estrogens in young women
and impaired protection of MHT in aged women.
 The goal of this application is to investigate the mechanism by which MHT fails to reduce ASCVD
events despite metabolic improvements and to define a therapeutic approach to reduce ASCVD risk in aged
women. To recapitulate the physiology in postmenopausal women with MHT, mouse models of estradiol (E2)
treatment with surgical menopause and atherosclerosis regression have been designed. Preliminary studies
show that atherosclerosis burden under MHT was associated with blood inflammatory factor interferon
gamma (IFNg) levels when hyperlipidemia was reduced. These results mirror the clinical observation that
MHT could not improve postmenopausal ASCVD risk when the inflammation index is high. Aging and
senescence-related cellular dysfunction may drive inflammation in the artery wall even when the blood lipid
profile is normal. My overarching hypothesis is that inflammation resolution in atherosclerotic lesions is
impaired by senescence-related incompetence of arterial repair in postmenopausal women with MHT. I
propose that ASCVD risk will be reduced with MHT when lipid risks and inflammation in atherosclerotic lesions
are resolved. I will explore this hypothesis with two Specific Aims: 1) Test the hypothesis that MHT improves
lipid metabolism but does not resolve arterial senescence and atherosclerotic inflammation. 2) Test the
hypothesis that correcting senescence and limiting inflammation in atherosclerotic lesions will restore the
cardiovascular benefits of menopause E2 treatment. Studies proposed in this application will reveal critical
mechanisms underlying why MHT fails to reverse atherosclerosis and lead to therapeutic approaches to
reduce ASCVD risk in postmenopausal women.
 My career goal is to lead a research team focused on managing ASCVD risks. I have a strong
background in lipid research and in the atherosclerosis field. The proposed project will afford me new
expertise in 1) studying cellular senescence and immune cell functions in inflammation resolution in
atherosclerosis regression, 2) translational science to reduce ASCVD risk by developing therapeutic methods
to block inflammation in the artery wall. I have proposed a career development plan that integrates formal
didactic training with a diverse hands-on mentorship committee to further refine my skills, competences, and
leadership ability. It is anticipated that completion of the proposed project and training plan will place me in
an ideal position to receive a tenure track faculty position."

Significant symptom overlap and high rates of co-occurrence between syndromes of posttraumatic stress
disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) call into question whether the two are distinct disorders.
The onset and course of both syndromes are strongly influenced by environmental variables. We hypothesize
that a continuum of life stress or adversity and an independent continuum of psychological trauma conspire to
influence the onset of PTSD and MDD (where at least one trauma exposure is required for PTSD). Our
overarching goal is to identify and compare neural signatures of MDD, PTSD, symptom features common to
PTSD and MDD, and heretofore unrecognized neurobiologically-defined syndromes. Therefore, we plan to
investigate neural signatures with supervised learning, and to identify biotypes that cut across disorders (PTSD
and MDD) with unsupervised learning, an approach that can better explain contributions of trauma, stressful
life events, and disease characteristics than possible with DSM-disorders. Rather than subtyping patients on
the basis of clinical symptoms or DSM-defined diagnoses, our goal is to identify distinct clusters of
neurobiological subtypes with disrupted neural signatures derived from resting-state fMRI. In Aim 1 we propose
to train algorithms with supervised learning to detect neural signatures from resting fMRI data that can classify
DSM diagnosis of comorbid PTSD and MDD, PTSD only, MDD only, and Controls (no psychiatric disorder).
The analysis will be performed separately with MDD and Control groups who experienced criterion-A trauma or
stressful life events, and those who did not. In Aim 2, we plan to use supervised learning in MDD and PTSD
patients to identify neural signatures from resting-state fMRI data associated with four trans-diagnostic
symptoms that include disrupted sleep, irritability, concentration difficulties, and loss of interest. In Aim 3, we
propose to apply unsupervised learning methods to identify novel biotypes associated with specific symptoms
or symptom clusters. The algorithms will employ rsfMRI features in patients with (1) PTSD only, (2) MDD only
and (2) across PTSD, MDD, and comorbid PTSD+MDD patients in order to identify potential trans-diagnostic
biotypes that cut across DSM boundaries. We will investigate associations of diagnosis-specific and trans-
diagnostic biotypes derived from unsupervised learning with stressful life events, trauma exposure,
developmental stage at time of exposure, psychiatric comorbidities, medical comorbidities, illness chronicity,
illness severity, gender, and age. The overlapping and intersecting patterns that maps circuit disruption to
psychiatric syndromes presents a daunting challenge in designing treatments that intervene at the circuit level.
Developing a neurobiologically-based nosology that maps to clinical symptoms and syndromes represents a
major advance in translational neuroscience. The advent of modern brain stimulation technology offers an
unprecedented possibility of intervening at the circuit level with precision medicine strategies."

Periodontal diseases affect 42% of adult Americans and are characterized by bacterial-driven inflammatory
bone loss. Traditional and emerging treatments for periodontitis management do not typically target the host
immune response, which is the major source of tissue damage. The demethylation activity of the chromatin
remodeling enzyme lysine-specific demethylase 1 (KDM1A) at the transcription activating mark histone 3 lysine
4 (H3K4) leads to a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokine transcription. By contrast, the chromatin remodeling
enzyme lysine specific demethylase 4B (KDM4B) specifically demethylates the transcription deactivating mark
histone 3 trimethyllysine 9 (H3K9me3), leading to up regulated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines
(PICs). Interestingly, cross talk between these two enzymes leads to a balanced system wherein lysine 9
hypomethylation by KDM4B serves as a prerequisite to lysine 4 hypomethylation by KDM1A. The research
plan outlined in this proposal will exploit this crosstalk for the design of new chemical probes for use in the
study of the epigenetic basis for PD. The the central hypothesis of this study is that promotion of KDM1A
activity by introduction of a specific KDM4B or KDM4E inhibitor will alleviate PD by reducing the expression of
PICs in diseased tissue and reducing osteoclast formation. Inhibitors so identified will be useful as chemical
probes to study the biochemical basis of inflammation and bone loss in PD. We will test this hypothesis
through completion of the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: We will use structure-based design
techniques to discover novel inhibitors of KDM4B or 4E for use as chemical tools to elucidate the mechanism
underlying inflammation and bone loss in PD; Specific Aim 2: We will define the cellular mechanism by which
KDM4B/4E over expression contributes to periodontal inflammation and bone loss; Specific Aim 3: We will
evaluate novel and known KDM4B/4E inhibitors for immunomodulatory activity in vivo using two models of PD.
Our preliminary results demonstrate that KDM4B and 4E protein is more abundant in vivo in periodontally
diseased connective tissue, and that inhibition of KDM4B results in significant decreases in PIC production and
osteoclastogenesis in tissue pre-treated with a periopathogenic lipopolysaccharide. New and existing inhibitors
will be used to further validate KDM4B as a therapeutic target in PD, and computational chemistry docking
experiments paired with physical compound screens will be employed to correlate compound structure and
changes in disease progression markers. Selected KDM4B inhibitors will be interrogated both in vitro and in
vivo for efficacy and toxicity. This study will provide a more robust understanding of epigenetic mechanisms
that play a significant role periodontal disease progression, validate KDM4B as a drug target for periodontitis,
and result in development of chemical probes with therapeutic potential for local immunomodulatory adjuvant
treatment of PD. This project will break down barriers between the fields of periodontics and drug design and
will foster the development of knowledge on a critically needed aspect of translational oral health science."
10817099,"Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is used as the cornerstone indicator of blood sugar monitoring to prevent
diabetic complications and hypoglycemia. However, HbA1c has limitations including unexplained racial
differences, and clinically significant mismatches between HbA1c and average glucose (AG). In the context of
its limitations, improvements in convenience, cost and accuracy of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)
devices have caused a reexamination of the future role for HbA1c. However, CGM glucose data is 1) a
challenge to interpret, 2) more invasive than a spot blood sample, and 3) of uncertain complications risk.
Bergenstal, Beck and colleagues recently proposed a Glucose Management Indicator (GMI) that represents
AG as a familiar “calculated” HbA1c. However, the prevalence of discrepancies between measured HbA1c vs.
GMI >0.5 percentage points is 28% of the GMI study reference population. As measured, HbA1c is the only
prospectively evaluated measure for assessing diabetes complications risk. The challenge is to determine the
mechanism of HbA1c-GMI mismatch in order to clarify whether GMI-calculated A1c is a valid AG surrogate
linked faithfully to complication risk.
 We hypothesize that the predominant cause for mismatch between AG and HbA1c is normal
variation in RBC lifespan. Using a modernized classic “gold standard” stable isotope (SI) method, we directly
measured mean RBC age MRBC (si-MRBC) in a small number of subjects and demonstrated heterogeneity in
MRBC sufficient to cause 1-2% point differences (e.g. 7 vs 6 or 8%) in HbA1c. However, as the SI method is a
research technique, Higgins developed semi-mechanistic models to derive MRBC from either CGM and HbA1c
(cgm-MRBC) or RBC/ reticulocyte cell volume and cell Hb distributions obtained from widely available complete
blood count (CBC) analyzers (cbc-MRBC). Using cgm-MRBC in 4 independent sets of subjects (age range 8-90),
cgm-MRBC fully accounted for mismatches. For this R01 application, in Aim 1, we propose to perform the SI
method on 70 subjects distributed equally between African-American and Caucasian subjects. si-MRBC will be
repeated (n=10) to confirm reproducibility of the SI method. CGM will be performed throughout. CGM and
HbA1c will be repeated in all subjects nine to twelve months after the initial evaluation to confirm temporally
stable normalization. In collaboration with Dr. Bergenstal, we will determine if variations in MRBC fully account
for differences between HbA1c and GMI within individuals. In Aim 2, we will concurrently assess the validity of
the Higgins semi-mechanistic models to allow more widespread application.
 We expect to demonstrate definitively that MRBC accounts for >80% of HbA1c/AG and HbA1c/GMI
mismatches and readily available measures can routinely correct for MRBC variation. Mechanistic results from
this study will put translation of risk prediction from decades of work with HbA1c on a more solid footing to this
new era with rapidly evolving clinical information provided by CGM."

Proteins carrying out DNA repair, replication and transcription, processes essential for the stable transmission
and expression of genomic information, share the same track – the DNA – and require delicate coordination to
achieve their function. Often, regulation of these processes occurs at the level of targeting or well-timed
recruitment, but also catalysis and even turnover of the factor in question. We will address these three principal
modalities of regulation in the context of bacterial responses to stress signals. Our questions and hypotheses
are grouped into two large areas, (1) regulation of the general stress response mediated by the promoter
specificity subunit RpoS; this is exemplary of a general stress response mechanism that affect transcription
initiation, and (2) specific responses to DNA damage such as subpathways of nucleotide excision repair; these
are exemplary of how the DNA damage response interfaces with transcription elongation, termination as well as
replication. The principal questions that will be addressed by my research plan are:
A. How are activating and inhibitory regulatory inputs integrated to tune the RpoS core pathway and
 globally reprogram transcription in response to an adverse environment? How does the ClpXP
 adaptor RssB and stress-specific ClpXP anti-adaptors tune the proteolysis of RpoS in a stress-specific
manner?
B. What are the mechanisms for preferential recruitment of the NER machinery to specific lesions,
 or to the template strand, directly read by RNA polymerase? How is the availability of early NER
 factors regulated by proteolysis in the context of DNA damage and transcription-coupled DNA repair?
 How and when do transcription-repair coupling factors collaborate with key players in the SOS response
 to promote mutagenesis? Can we leverage these mechanisms towards developing novel anti-evolution
 drugs for combination therapies against infection with diverse pathogens?
Previous work has already allowed us to build a critical collection of reagents and expertise in the structural
biology and biochemistry of transcription-coupled repair and RpoS biology. This gives us now an excellent entry
point for a mechanistic dissection of the processes listed above and the development of novel antimicrobial
strategies. The significance of our work is thus not only fundamental and conceptual in nature, but has immediate
applications in controlling the worldwide public health crisis of antimicrobial resistance, particularly in the age of
the COVID-19 pandemic."
10817102,"Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is the
most significant risk factor contributing to death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and resulting visual field loss in
primary open angle glaucoma (POAG). The current standard of care for glaucoma includes treatment with IOP-
lowering medications delivered topically as eye drops. However, many patients continue to lose visual fields
despite being on IOP-lowering drops. We have taken a comprehensive genetics approach to seek new drug
targets that may address the limitations of current therapies. We have demonstrated that Cacna2d1 is
specifically linked to high IOP both in mice and humans. We have also shown that a selective Cacna2d1
blocker exhibits potent IOP-lowering activity that can achieve a maximal IOP reduction >40% that does not
return to baseline for ~33 hours when delivered by bioadhesive microemulsion. We have also determined that
CACNA2D1 is localized to the CB, TM and RGCs, suggesting that inhibitors of this protein could both lower
IOP and protect RGCs. Lastly, we have shown that the degree of IOP lowering is correlated with the gene
haplotype, thus demonstrating the potential of tailoring treatment to a patient’s genetic profile. Our overall
objective is to develop and validate one or more novel topical formulations to deliver the effective drugs to
inhibit CACNA2D1 in a once daily topical formulation. This treatment strategy will reduce the burden to the
patient, increase compliance and lead to better visual outcomes. Our central hypothesis is that a small
molecule that targets CACNA2D1—when formulated in a topical microemulsion—will elicit an IOP-lowering
response that is greater in amplitude and duration than other glaucoma medications. Overall strengths of this
proposal include: 1) the combination of a strong interdisciplinary team; 2) the successful utilization of a
genetics approach to identify a new drug target for blocking glaucoma-related increases in IOP and RGC
death; 3) the potential for utilizing our novel drug for precision medicine and; 4) the development and
optimization of an innovative IOP delivery strategy using an extended-release formulation. In this proposal, we
provide proof-of-concept data and address key feasibility questions by establishing efficacy,
pharmacodynamics, biocompatibility and biodistribution of our novel microemulsion treatment. We develop a
novel topical once daily microemulsion formulation as a new glaucoma therapy; measure the movement of
CACNA2D1 inhibitors across the cornea, determine pharmacokinetic movements in the eye and assess full-
body biodistribution; establish the mechanism of action of CACNA2D1 inhibitors as glaucoma therapies;
determine if the haplotype of Cacna2d1 influences the IOP-lowering response to our formulation(s); and
prepare and submit an IND application to the FDA. These results will position us to proceed directly to a Phase
II demonstration project in preparation for Phase III commercialization."

The overall goal of this project is to train University of Utah (UOU) undergraduate students from
underrepresented racial/ethnic backgrounds in air pollution-related health research through a faculty-mentored
summer program called Health, Air Pollution and Population Initiative in Education and Science Training

imperative to engage members of these communities—especially college students interested in STEM
research—in addressing the complex problems caused by poor air quality and environmental inequity. Specific
aims are to:
 1. Implement a comprehensive strategy to recruit UOU students from underrepresented backgrounds
 into the HAPPIEST R25 program.
 2. Immerse undergraduate students in a mentoring “community of practice” founded on an
 interdisciplinary, team-based approach to environmental health research, specifically as it relates to
 air pollution.
 3. Utilize formative and summative evaluation to improve the quality and effectiveness of HAPPIEST as
 well as inform future undergraduate research training programs that aim to increase the participation of
 underrepresented groups in NIEHS-related research.
The “community of practice” is comprised of four research teams, each with two undergraduate students, one
graduate student training coordinator, and at least one faculty mentor. Teams will work on locally-relevant air
pollution and health research, with the potential for interdisciplinary integration across teams. HAPPIEST will
serve a total of forty undergraduates over the five years of the project. The program directors will implement
strategic activities for student recruitment, research training, professional development, and mentoring. Using
an asset-oriented approach designed to build on student strengths, HAPPIEST activities will prepare students
for placement into competitive graduate programs in the environmental health sciences. The project is of great"

Over the last two decades, neuroscientists have used antidepressant placebo probes to examine the biological
mechanisms implicated in antidepressant placebo effects. However, findings from these studies have not yet
elucidated a model-based theory that would explain the mechanism through which antidepressant
expectancies evolve to induce persistent mood changes. Emerging evidence suggests that antidepressant
placebo effects may be informed by models of reinforcement learning, such that an individual’s expectation of
improvement is updated with the arrival of new sensory evidence, by incorporating a reward prediction error
(RPE), which signals the mismatch between the expected (expected value) and perceived improvement.
Consistent with this framework, neuroimaging studies of antidepressant placebo effects have demonstrated
placebo-induced μ-opioid activation and increased blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) responses in regions
tracking expected values [e.g., ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC)] and RPEs [e.g., ventral striatum (VS)].
In this study, we will demonstrate the causal contribution of reward learning signals (expected values and
RPEs) to antidepressant placebo effects by experimentally manipulating expected values using transcranial
magnetic stimulation (TMS) targeting the vmPFC and μ-opioid striatal RPE signal using pharmacological
approaches. We hypothesized that antidepressant placebo expectancies are represented in the vmPFC
(expected value) and updated by means of μ-opioid-modulated striatal leaning signal (RPE). In a 3x3 factorial
double-blind design, we will randomize 120 unmedicated MDD individuals to one of three between-subject
opioid conditions: the μ-opioid agonist buprenorphine, the μ-opioid antagonist naltrexone, or the inert pill.
Within each arm, individuals will be assigned to receive three within-subject counterbalanced forms of TMS
targeting the vmPFC—intermittent Theta Burst Stimulation (TBS) expected to potentiate the vmPFC,
continuous TBS expected to de-potentiate the vmPFC, or sham TBS. These experimental manipulations will
be used to modulate trial-by-trial reward learning signals and related brain activity during the Antidepressant
Placebo fMRI Task to address the following aims: 1) investigate the relationship between reward learning
signals within the vmPFC-VS circuit and antidepressant placebo effects; 2) examine the causal contribution of
vmPFC expected value computations to antidepressant placebo effects; and 3) investigate the causal
contribution of μ-opioid-modulated striatal RPEs to antidepressant placebo effects. The proposed study will be
the first to investigate the causal contribution of μ-opioid-modulated vmPFC-VS learning signals to
antidepressant placebo responses, paving the way for developing novel treatments modulating learning
processes and objective means of quantifying – and potentially reducing – placebo effects during drug
development."

Bone tissue has high intrinsic regenerative potential, yet deficits in mesenchymal precursor numbers, function,
or supportive tissues lead to non-healing bony defects – a significant clinical problem within and outside of the
dental sciences. Mixed stromal populations termed `mesenchymal stem cells' (MSCs) have clear therapeutic
benefit for skeletal tissue engineering, however recent clinical trials using MSC have demonstrated suboptimal
or inconsistent results. Our team has a long-standing interest in human pericytes for tissue engineering.
However, the tissue-specific attributes of human pericytes has also been increasingly recognized. To further
investigate the tissue-specific properties of human pericytes, we recently examined differences in FACS
purified human CD146+ pericytes from either skeletal or soft tissue sources. Results showed that CD146+
human pericytes have a tendency to replicate the microenvironment from which they are derived (either bone-
forming or fat-forming depending on tissue of origin). Leveraging transcriptomic analysis of FACS-purified cell
clones, we found that the activator of the Rho family of small GTPases TIAM1 plays a critical role in cellular
differentiation decisions in human pericytes. In the current K08 proposal, we will test the central hypothesis
that the osteogenic inhibitor TIAM1 maintains the adipose tissue identity of human pericytes, and that gene
deletion will drive bone anabolism among implanted human pericytes.

Targeting of Bioorthogonal Chemotherapeutic Nanozymes to Tumor-Associated Macrophages

(TAMs) in breast cancer, using bioorthogonal chemistry to turn them into ‘drug factory’ platforms for generation
of chemotherapeutics at the tumor site. We will use our ‘nanozyme’ platform to encapsulate and protect transition
metal catalysts (TMCs) within the monolayer of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). These nanozymes will be targeted

 targeted nanozymes to activate profluorophores and prodrugs at tumor sites using 4T1 orthotopic breast
 carcinoma models. Quantitative tumor and intratumoral nanozyme distributions will be obtained using
 inductively-coupled mass spectrometry, and efficacy quantified by tumor size and mouse health.

 Dementias During and After the COVID-19 Pandemic
PROJECT SUMMARY
 The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has devastated nursing home residents in
the US, nearly half of whom are diagnosed with Alzheimer's and other related dementias (ADRD). To limit
resident exposure and expand safe access to desperately-needed care from physicians and advanced practice
providers, Medicare dropped previously tight restrictions and temporarily allowed SNFs to broadly use
telemedicine to obtain care for residents. Dropping these restrictions helped facilitate a rapid adoption of
telemedicine in SNFs, from <1% of SNFs billing for any telemedicine services in Oct-Dec 2019 to 55% in Apr-
May 2020.
 Telemedicine has long been regarded as a promising, but underused, delivery innovation for SNFs
addressing two major gaps in care. First, SNF clinicians are not always onsite, so medical issues that present
during off-hours are often addressed by transferring patients, often unnecessarily, to the emergency
department. Second, due to both financial and logistic reasons it is very difficult for SNF residents to obtain
specialty care, including specialties critical those with ADRD like neurology or psychiatry. A limited literature
suggests that telemedicine can bridge both of these care gaps, but more rigorous evidence is needed.
 In 2021, understanding the adoption and clinical impact of SNF telemedicine for the vulnerable
population of older adults with ADRD has new urgency. We propose to use Medicare claims, the Minimum
Data Set and a national survey on SNF telemedicine implementation to answer the following specific aims:
1) Evaluate the patient-level association of SNF adoption of telemedicine in 2020 with health care use and
 clinical outcomes (COVID-19 and non-COVID-19) for SNF residents with and without ADRD.
2) Use group-based trajectory models to characterize 2020-2021 SNF-level patterns of telemedicine use (e.g.,
 sustaining vs. de-adopting) and SNF characteristics associated with different trajectories.
3) Survey a national sample of SNFs, stratified by their trajectories measured in Aim 2, to assess facility
 leadership perceptions of telemedicine use and telemedicine implementation strategies.
 Understanding how SNFs have used telemedicine and its association with clinical outcomes is
essential to inform how Medicare and state Medicaid programs should regulate and promote telemedicine use
in SNFs. Our findings will also help guide clinicians who care for SNF residents with ADRD on the clinical
impact associated with telemedicine use and how it is being used nationally."

My career goal is to develop an independent research program that utilizes a comprehensive, multi-method
approach to investigate mechanisms by which ultra-processed foods (UPFs) directly contribute to overeating
and obesity. My training as a clinical psychologist has provided me with a strong foundation in understanding
behavioral responses that may contribute to overeating and individual differences in problematic eating
behavior. However, I have had no formal training in biological underpinnings that may drive UPF consumption
and am seeking advanced training in evaluating reward processes and identifying behavioral phenotypes
within obesity. My training plan will build upon my skillsets and expand my knowledge in three areas: 1)
adapting methods used to identify the reinforcing ingredients of rewarding substances to assess which
attributes of UPFs contribute to their high reward potential; 2) investigating biological markers of individual
differences in food reward and physiological and metabolic responses to UPF consumption; and 3) identifying
behavioral phenotypes within obesity in order to better understand differential susceptibility to UPF reward. In
order to achieve these objectives, I will engage in a variety of training activities, guided by my mentorship
team, including regular supervision meetings, directed readings, attendance at classes, seminars, and
scientific conferences, and in-lab methodological training. The proposed study will use a within-subjects design
to address these training goals by evaluating differences in biobehavioral reward responses to UPFs high in
both fat + refined carbohydrates, compared to UPFs high in fat only or refined carbohydrates only or minimally
processed foods. Participants will each attend four food consumption appointments, one for each
aforementioned food type, where subjective indices of reward and metabolic responses will be assessed while
anticipating and eating the food. The present work is the first to elucidate the biological and behavioral
experiences of consuming nutritionally diverse UPFs that may mechanistically contribute to overeating.
Understanding which ingredients in UPFs are most reinforcing and the biobehavioral underpinnings will inform
novel intervention targets for weight management and problematic eating behavior. The environment at the
Center for Weight, Eating, and Lifestyle Science and state-of-the-art coursework and seminars at Drexel
University are ideal for my training goals. My mentorship team will be led by Dr. Evan Forman (Professor,
Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences; Director, Center for Weight, Eating, and Lifestyle Science)
and includes training from Dr. Kelly Allison (Professor, Weight and Eating Disorders) in the biological
underpinnings of food reward and Dr. Janet Audrain-McGovern (Professor, Addictions) in methodology used to
assess the reinforcing nature of substances. This interdisciplinary team will facilitate successful implementation
of the proposed research and training plan and the development of an R01 application based on the findings
from the present work."

Childhood obesity is a growing public health epidemic that is disproportionally affecting Hispanic children and
associated with morbidity and downstream health disparities. Early-life adversity and childhood psychosocial
stressors have been shown to contribute to obesity risk, with stronger effects reported among children growing
up in lower-income households. The period of fetal development and early-life are marked by dynamic and rapid
changes in fetal DNA methylation programming, epigenetic maturation of immune system-related genes in early-
childhood and general physiological development. A poor and adverse social environment in early life has been
hypothesized to contribute to epigenomic “weathering” leading to accelerated decline in health, aging and
eventual health disparities, including obesity. A leading hypothesis for the origins of health disparities is the
biological embedding of adversity on the epigenome due to chronic adversity exposure. While emerging
evidence indicates that psychosocial stressors and adversity are associated with epigenetic biomarkers like DNA
methylation, significant limitations remain in the field. Namely, most studies to date have been cross-sectional,
used candidate gene approaches, not investigated changes or trajectories in epigenetic biomarkers throughout
development, or functional consequences in gene expression. The proposed project will leverage data and
samples from The Center for the Health Assessment of Mothers and Children of Salinas (CHAMACOS), a long-
term study of low-income Latinx, predominantly Mexican American, mother-child pairs living in the Salinas Valley
of California. We have repeated measurements and samples for DNA methylation analyses at birth, 7, 9, 14 and
18 years in approximately 300 mother-child pairs, genetics, and stabilized RNA for sequencing at 14 years of
age. We will investigate both pre- and postnatal early-life adversity measures to 1) determine if adversity
measures are associated with blood DNA methylation trajectories and subsequent variation in gene expression;
2) evaluate if adversity measures influence epigenetic aging clocks and biomarkers and their trajectories and if
longitudinal changes are prospectively associated with obesity risk; and 3) determine if DNA methylation or
epigenetic aging mediate associations with obesity and if an epigenetic adversity score can be constructed from
children’s blood methylome. Our study will address critical gaps in the field by testing hypotheses prospectively
over 18 years and addressing questions of persistence and embedment of pre- and postnatal adversity. We will
test if epigenetic changes influence gene expression with untargeted RNA sequencing at 14 years. We will
evaluate if DNA methylation can serve as a reliable biomarker of adversity in early-life and or alternatively if
these biomarkers are causal for the relationship between adversity and obesity risk with mediation and
mendelian randomization methods. Our approach will yield rigorous data to test the biological embedment of
social adversity and its consequences in a Latinx, low-income birth cohort with high obesity prevalence."

Despite experiencing a higher prevalence of depressive symptoms, Latinx adolescents are significantly less
likely to receive treatment for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and are more likely to drop out of
psychotherapy prematurely than their non-Latinx White peers. Research is needed to develop patient- and
family-focused implementation strategies to promote Latinx adolescents' initiation of and retention in
psychotherapy for depression. The candidate aims to identify, refine, and test a patient- and family-focused
implementation strategy to target barriers to psychotherapy attendance among Latinx youth. In Aim 1, a
national sample of Latino adolescents (n=15), parents (n=15), and healthcare providers (n=5) will participate in
focus groups to identify preferred strategies to promote psychotherapy attendance. In Aim 2, a series of design
thinking workshops will be carried out with a community advisory board (N=8) to refine and develop the content
of the implementation strategy. Qualitative descriptive methods and rapid content analysis will be employed in
aims 1 and 2. In Aim 3, the candidate will conduct a clinical trial to determine the preliminary effect of the
patient- and family-focused implementation strategy on psychotherapy attendance and depressive symptoms
among Latinx adolescents (N=60) and identify facilitators, barriers, and early implementation outcomes
(acceptability, adoption, feasibility, and fidelity) related to the implementation of the strategy and psychotherapy
among Latinx adolescents. Latinx adolescents diagnosed with MDD or Persistent Depressive Disorder and
referred to psychotherapy will be recruited from primary care clinics in North Carolina and randomly assigned
to the implementation strategy or treatment as usual group (n=30 each). Measurements will be taken at
baseline, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks. Wilcoxon Two-Sample Tests will be used to compare group differences in
the percent of scheduled psychotherapy visits attended at 24 weeks. Wilcoxon Signed Rank Tests will be used
to determine change in the depressive symptoms from baseline to week 12, and baseline to week 24.
Qualitative interviews with Latinx adolescents, parents, and healthcare providers will be conducted to complete
a multi-method evaluation of implementation process outcomes. The results of the study will lay a foundation
for a full-scale R01 randomized controlled trial. The identified patient- and family-focused implementation
strategy might also serve as a model for addressing behavioral health disparities among other groups of ethnic
minority and immigrant youth. During this award, the candidate will also obtain critical training in
implementation science, adaptation of programs for Latinx families, adolescent depression treatment, and
clinical trial design. The proposed award will support the candidate's long-term goal of promoting mental health
equity among Latinx adolescents and her transition into an independent, health disparities researcher."
10808185,"Corticothalamic circuits linking the primary sensory cortex with the primary sensory thalamus in the feedback
direction are ubiquitous across sensory modalities and mammalian species and are ideally positioned to regulate
the flow of sensory signals from periphery to cortex. However, the functional role of these circuits in sensory
perception remains a fundamental mystery in neuroscience. In the visual system, corticogeniculate neurons
provide the majority of inputs onto neurons in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), however receptive
fields of LGN neurons closely resemble their retinal inputs and not their corticogeniculate inputs. Partly because
corticogeniculate influence over LGN activity is modulatory rather than driving, the functional role of
corticogeniculate feedback in vision has been difficult to characterize. The overarching goal of this proposal is to
elucidate the structural organization of corticogeniculate feedback and its functional role in visual perceptual
behavior. To accomplish this goal, intersecting and emerging technologies are employed including functional
ultrasound imaging, neurophysiological recording, optogenetics, and chemogenetics in two highly visual
mammalian species: ferrets and macaque monkeys. Building upon our previous findings that corticogeniculate
feedback regulates the timing and precision of LGN responses to visual inputs, the three Specific Aims of this
proposal address important new questions regarding the function and connectivity of corticogeniculate feedback.
Specific Aim 1 will examine whether corticogeniculate feedback regulates the temporal dynamics of LGN
neurons uniquely, depending on the type of visual feature information they convey. Specific Aim 2 will examine
the spatial extent of corticogeniculate influence over LGN population activity using a combination of functional
ultrasound and optogenetics. Aim 2 will also examine the precise functional connectivity between individual
corticogeniculate and LGN neurons to determine whether corticogeniculate circuits exert stream-specific
influence on individual LGN neurons. A major motivation behind Specific Aims 1 and 2 is to determine whether
corticogeniculate feedback regulates visual information transmission through the LGN in a stream-specific
manner or whether corticogeniculate influence is more global and diffuse. Specific Aim 3 represents a significant
step forward in understanding corticogeniculate function by testing how corticogeniculate circuits contribute to
visual discrimination behavior. We have developed a novel virus-mediated gene delivery strategy that enables
selective manipulation of corticogeniculate circuits via optogenetics or chemogenetics, applicable to long-term
behavioral experiments in ferrets. Together, results of the experiments proposed under each Aim will provide a
fuller picture of the functional role of corticogeniculate feedback in visual perception by revealing the underlying
connectivity and mechanisms giving rise to these functions. Importantly, insights gained about corticogeniculate
circuit function could generalize across corticothalamic and corticocortical pathways throughout the sensory
system and inform understanding of sensory circuit disruptions associated with many neurological disorders."

10808890,"Signature Project Abstract
 Community colleges provide a critical pathway for workforce development and socio-economic gain, but
this opportunity is mitigated by unmet need for mental health services, particularly for depression and anxiety,
and particularly for racial/ethnic minority students. Mental health problems intersect with high rates of food
insecurity, housing insecurity and homelessness to create a mutually exacerbating cycle of disability and
impairment. A scalable and effective system of care that manages mental health needs in concert with social
mental health determinants is sorely needed. The Signature Project aims to optimize the effectiveness of
scalable system of care, called STAND, in low income, highly diverse sample at East Los Angeles College, while
concurrently advancing the science of personalized mental health care. Greater personalization of tools for
clinical decision-making offers more efficient and more effective allocation to treatments that reduce attrition and
improve symptomatic and functional outcomes. Personalization includes selecting the appropriate level of care
at initial presentation and knowing when a change to level of care is needed. This is the first study to address
tools for personalizing care that are suited to the needs of diverse community college students.
 The goal of the Signature Project is to compare standard of care approaches for treatment triaging and
adaptation (based on symptom severity alone) to data-driven algorithms that draw from four overlapping and
mutually reinforcing constructs: social determinants of mental health; early adversity and life stress;
predisposing, enabling and need influences upon health services use; and comprehensive mental health status.
Static features at baseline as well as trajectories over time will be used to allocate to initial level of care (ranging
from self-guided online prevention, to coach-guided online therapy, to clinician delivered care) and inform
adaptation of care (e.g., stay the course, increase level of care, re-initiate care) over 40 weeks. ELAC students
will be randomized (N=200 per year, total N=1000) to either symptom severity-based decision making or to data-
driven decision making. We will evaluate whether the data-driven algorithms improve adherence, symptoms of
depression and anxiety, and functioning. The measures and algorithms will be refined annually based on
statistical prediction, review by the Methods Core Health Disparities/Cultural Competency group, and
observational data from the Healthy Minds Survey results from 10 community colleges across California
(including ELAC). The end goals are to optimize the effectiveness of the STAND program for ELAC students,
while creating templates for personalization to be sustained and spread to other community colleges, and
generating data that will inform cost-effectiveness and return-on-investment projections for implementation of
STAND region or state-wide."
10808894,"Project 1 Abstract
Community college (CC) students experience more prevalent and severe mental health problems compared to
their four-year university counterparts1,2 yet are much less likely to receive mental health services. These
disparities are amplified among racial and ethnic minority students, who experience multiple attitudinal and
logistic barriers to mental health service as well as social and economic stressors4,7,23,25,34. Consistent with the
ALACRITY Center Aim 2 to optimize the implementation of STAND, this R34 will focus on culturally responsive
and community informed interventions to improve rates of screening and initial uptake of STAND in a CC where
students are primarily low-income, and Latinx. With a user-centered-design, we aim to use student input
iteratively across four years to develop and test engagement interventions that maximize recruitment and initial
uptake of STAND at East Los Angeles College. Initially, 12 focus groups will be conducted with 60-72 ELAC
students who have completed 1) screening only, 2) screening and consent/baseline assessment, 3) screening,
consent/baseline and attendance at an orientation visit, and 4) those who have not yet signed up for screening,
in order to explore facilitators and inhibitors of these phases of engagement. Qualitative findings, preliminary
studies, and extant literature will inform the content of the engagement interventions that address barriers
commonly known to affect initial service utilization in Latinx students, including mental health stigma, mental
health knowledge, and perceived need18,19,21,27. We also have selected interventions that are feasible and have
a structure that can be transported to various community college contexts to support spread in the future. During
Year 2, we will examine the effectiveness of video testimonials (a low intensity informational intervention) which
feature Latinx CC students with lived experiences of anxiety and depression, by comparing rates of those who
complete STAND screening during Year 1 (standard recruitment) to Year 2 (standard recruitment with video
testimonials). During Year 3, we will examine a culturally embedded digital fotonovela with aspects of
motivational enhancement therapy (an intervention that aims to inform and activate). 270 ELAC students will be
randomized to the fotonovela condition or to an active control group (e.g., standard educational materials).
During year 4, we will examine a peer-led telephone engagement intervention which aims to inform and activate
through collaboration with a peer coach; 308 students will be randomized to the peer-led engagement condition
or to recruitment as usual. The primary outcome for both RCTs will be initial uptake in STAND as defined by
completion of an orientation visit. We will also examine whether each of the engagement interventions leads to
changes in mental health knowledge, stigma, self-efficacy, and perceived need that account for higher rates of
service uptake. Efforts to improve screening and uptake for mental health programs like STAND are critical to
the successful implementation of mental health programs on CC campuses and the reduction of ongoing mental
health disparities."
10808897,"Project 2 Abstract
The overarching goal of Project 2 is to optimize peer coaching in order to optimize engagement and outcomes
in digital therapy. The unmet mental health needs of community college students are staggering and a growing
body of research demonstrates that therapy provided digitally with the assistance of trained community
members without advanced degrees in mental health is an effective and scalable way to address these needs.
Despite being effective for improving symptoms and functioning in those who engage in it, uptake and
engagement in digital therapy is generally quite low. Recent research suggests that this is especially true of
Latinx individuals, who tend to have unique and significant unmet mental health needs. To address these issues,
Project 2 will examine treatment engagement, treatment satisfaction, symptoms, and functioning outcomes
among Latinx students at East Los Angeles College (ELAC) receiving digital therapy with peer coaching in the
STAND program. ELAC is a large and diverse community college that is predominantly Latinx. A sample of 240
ELAC students who identify as Latinx will be independently recruited, separate from the Signature Project. A
2x2 design will randomize ELAC students to one of four peer coaching conditions (n = 60 per condition): 1)
demographic matching + standard supervision, 2) demographic matching + reduced supervision, 3) no
demographic matching + standard supervision, and 4) no demographic matching + reduced supervision.
Students in the demographic matching condition will be assigned to peer coaches who also identify as Latinx,
whereas those in the no demographic matching condition will be assigned to peer coaches who do not identify
as Latinx. Supervision will either involve individual session review and personalized feedback or not. Students
will participate in this project for 24 weeks and will complete brief weekly assessment batteries and longer
assessment batteries at baseline and at weeks 8, 16, and 24. Explanatory/intervening variables that are
hypothesized to explain treatment effects will also be explored. In addition to the quantitative data collected
from the RCT, we will collect and analyze qualitative data from the peer coaches via annual focus groups and
will evaluate cost-effectiveness specifically focused on costs related to supervision. Combined, these data will
inform the iterative refinements made to Tier II in the Signature Project, and will significant gaps in the literature
regarding demographic matching, clinical supervision, and mental health disparities experienced by Latinx
individuals, particularly as they relate to the developing field of digital mental health."
10808899,"PROJECT SUMMARY 
The long-term goal of the proposed research is to investigate understudied genetic mechanisms that are 
hypothesized to influence common diseases. Genetic analyses of complex traits have been largely performed 
within populations of individuals of the same ancestry, mainly of European descent. Besides being ethically 
questionable, this is problematic for disease risk prediction as it has been shown that prediction accuracy 
declines proportionally to increasing genetic divergence between training samples and target samples. One 
hypothesis for this observation is that different populations are likely exposed to different contexts (e.g., 
environmental conditions), which results in different effect sizes across populations in the presence of 
genotype-by-context interactions. In addition, context-dependent effects can influence prediction accuracy 
substantially even between groups (e.g., different sexes) of the same ancestry. Thus, prediction models that 
account for gene-by-context interactions could perform better than standard prediction models for disease risk 
in humans. While such models have provided increased accuracy in agricultural and model species, this topic 
has not yet been investigated in humans. This proposal will fill this gap by investigating the importance of 
gene-by-context interactions to the genetic architecture of blood pressure traits in multi-ancestry samples, and 
their incorporation into statistical models to increase the accuracy of phenotypic prediction. Blood pressure 
traits are very important medical traits (e.g., they a risk factor for the leading cause of death worldwide, 
cardiovascular disease) and are also excellent models of complex traits (they are moderately heritable traits, 
common variants alone explain only less than half of the total heritability, and GWAS hits explain only a few 
percent of the total variation). The proposed research will make use of publicly available large datasets, 
including (but not limited to) the UK Biobank and those being part of the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine 
(TOPMed) consortium. In Specific Aim 1, the focus will be on estimating the proportion of variance explained 
by and map gene-by-context interactions in multi-ancestry samples using a combination of already existing 
linear mixed models and Bayesian methods. In Specific Aim 2, the focus will be on increasing prediction 
accuracy in both single-ancestry and multi-ancestry samples by incorporating gene-by-context interactions into 
prediction models. While existing linear mixed models and Bayesian methods developed for agricultural data 
will be applied, a new prediction method better suited to human data will also be developed. Briefly, the main 
idea is to model gene-by-context interactions explicitly for the available contexts, while also accounting for 
other unknown sources of effect heterogeneity among ancestries. This proposal will provide novel insights into 
the genetic architecture of blood pressure traits that will improve prediction accuracy in multi-ancestry samples 
as well as a novel analysis strategy/methodology that can be applied to any trait of interest."

The overall Project 3 goal is to advance science and clinical care for preventing suicide and self-harm and
strengthen knowledge for reaching our national objectives of reducing suicide deaths and attempts.22 Within the
context of the Center treatment model, “Screening and Treatment for Anxiety and Depression” (STAND), Project
3 extends the clinical targets of STAND to reducing suicide and self-harm risk with the goals of enhancing STAND
effectiveness and benefits, and offering a scalable suicide/self-harm prevention model for community colleges.
Recognizing disparities in mental health outcomes and access to evidence-based care, we focus on East Los
Angeles Community College (ELAC), a community college site in a diverse, low-income area in Los Angeles.
Using the Signature Project sample (N=1000) and methods, Project 3 seeks to: 1) enhance risk detection through
developing/evaluating algorithms for identifying indicators of “SU/SH risk states” that emerge prior to the onset
of suicidal/self-harm (SU/SH) behavior, and provide opportunities to deliver “just-in-time” interventions to prevent
suicidal/self-harm episodes; 2) evaluate the effectiveness of STAND with treatment tier/level assigned and
adapted based on data-driven algorithms, as compared to symptom severity, on suicide/self-harm outcomes;
and 3) enhance the effectiveness of STAND for suicide/self-harm prevention by augmenting STAND with a
technology-enhanced suicide prevention intervention (TE-SPI) that combines intervention components with
demonstrated benefits in prior research. These include: safety planning; a digital intervention (BRITE app) that
prompts safety plan use, skills, and hope; and caring contacts. The TE-SPI will be pre-tested and adapted for
the Center population during Years 1 & 2, providing data on safety, feasibility, acceptability, and intervention
effects. In Years 3-5, 420 students selected for need (STAND Tiers III or II) will be randomly assigned to either
the TE-SPI plus STAND with Usual Risk Management (URM), or STAND with URM. We test the hypothesis that
the TE-SPI group, relative to URM, will show: increased treatment engagement/contacts (i.e. app, STAND);
lower risk of suicide/self-harm events; greater improvement in severity of suicidality; lower levels of suicide/self-
harm related adverse events (e.g. hospitalizations, ED visits); and that increased treatment engagement leads
to improved suicide/self-harm outcomes. Primary and secondary outcomes respectively are: suicide/self-harm
events (including suicide attempts, unclear and nonsuicidal self-harm/NSSI); and an ordinal suicidality scale with
categories of none, ideation, intent/plan, suicidal behavior, suicide attempts."
10808906,"Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) provide information on the cis-regulatory elements controlling contextspecific 
expression of target genes, as well as the transcription factors acting on these elements. 
Understanding the dynamics of gene regulation is fundamental for understanding how cells undergo 
specialization for different functions, despite having the same genome; how cells respond to different 
environments by modulating gene expression; and how non-coding genetic variants cause diseases. 
Inference of GRNs from genomics data is a systematic approach to study gene regulation. However, the 
accuracy of such inference is limited if the cellular context under interest is a heterogenous mixture. The 
development of single cell genomics technologies can fill this gap by providing high-resolution GRNs. 
Therefore, there is a compelling need for efficient statistical methods to infer GRNs from single cell 
genomics data. The long-term goal of this project is to obtain a mechanistic understanding of how noncoding 
genetic variants affect cellular context-dependent GRNs and influence phenotypes. Single cell 
transcriptomic (scRNA-seq) and chromatin accessibility (scATAC-seq) data provide information on different 
cellular features, i.e., gene expression and active regulatory element location, respectively. Integration of 
these two types of data will provide more accurate information on gene regulation. In Specific Aim 1, we 
will extend our initial studies inferring subpopulation-dependent GRNs from unpaired scRNA-seq and 
scATAC-seq data (supported by a COBRE in Human Genetics Pilot Project since 02/01/2022) by 
benchmarking existing methods for integrative analysis of unpaired scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data to 
build an optimized pipeline for unpaired data analysis. We will develop a statistical method to infer 
subpopulation-specific GRNs and analyze large-scale published datasets to build a database of GRNs for 
hundreds of cellular contexts. In Specific Aim 2, we will develop statistical methods for comparative gene 
regulatory analysis based on single cell genomics data. The comparison of GRNs between samples from 
diseased versus healthy patients or between two different treatments is an important scientific problem. 
Thus, an efficient computational method for comparative gene regulatory analysis based on different types 
of single cell genomics data is needed. In Specific Aim 3, we will develop a method and software to infer 
cell type specific GRNs from sc-multiome data. This method and software would have a significant and 
broad impact by providing a detailed view of how trans- and cis-regulatory elements work together to affect 
gene expression in a cell type-specific manner."
10808982,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The development of broadly cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) in HIV-1 infected humans and SHIV
infected rhesus macaques (RMs) requires iterative rounds of envelope glycoprotein (Env)-mediated B cell
receptor stimulation, neutralizing antibody (NAb) elicitation, and associated virus escape. In this virus/antibody
“arms race”, particular Env escape mutants are generated which, among the myriads of other Env variants
present in infected individuals, are able to prime and boost antibody lineages that are capable of developing
neutralization breadth. Although the principle of virus/antibody co-evolution has been established, the number,
identity, succession, and cooperation of the particular Env variants that initiate and sustain bNAb lineage
maturation remain largely unknown. In this renewal application, this HIVRAD team proposes to use simian-
human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) infected rhesus macaques (RMs) as a molecular guide to develop HIV-1
Env immunogens that elicit V3 high mannose patch bNAbs. In collaboration with Projects 1 and 3, we will trace
the patterns of Env-antibody coevolution in RMs that develop V3 glycan patch bNAbs and then use this
information to identify specific Env variants that prime and affinity-mature these responses towards neutralization
breadth. Recent work by the group provides strong support for these goals (1-6). First, the team identified
heterologous neutralization breadth in 24 of 150 RMs infected with various HIV-1 Env bearing SHIVs, including
nine animals with V3 high mannose patch bNabs (see Preliminary Data of Project 1). Second, Env-antibody
coevolution in SHIV infected RMs was found to be strikingly similar to that observed in the corresponding
humans, including similar immunogenetics, structural and chemical solutions to epitope recognition, and near-
identical Env escape pathways in response to Nab pressures (1-5). Finally, the team devised a rational strategy
for sequential immunogen design to circumvent difficult roadblocks in bNAb induction by vaccination (6). We
thus hypothesize that characterization of Env-antibody coevolution in RMs infected by germline-targeted CH848
and BG505.N332 SHIVs will identify Env immunotypes that, when constructed as nanoparticles or SOSIP Env
trimers and used to immunize RMs, will elicit V3 glycan bNAbs. The Virus and Antibody Sequencing Core (Core
B) will continue to support this HIVRAD team by providing state-of-the-art virus and antibody sequencing
services as well as unique virology expertise. Working closely with the Bioinformatics and Statistics Core
(Core C) as well as Projects 1, 2 and 3, we will (i) characterize the evolving env quasispecies in SHIV infected
macaques that develop V3 glycan bNAbs to map neutralization escape pathways (Aim 1), and (ii) sequence
antibody heavy and light chain V(D)J variable regions from rhesus memory B cells before and after SHIV infection
as well as knock-in mice after immunization to facilitate bNAb lineage tracing and define the role of antigen
receptor affinity in B cell fates (Aim 2). The goal is to identify key steps in Env-antibody co-evolution required for
V3 glycan bNAb development that can be rapidly translated into rational immunogen design."
10808985,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Vaccines that can induce broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) will be needed to protect against the global
diversity of HIV-1 strains, however they do not currently exist (1,2). Vaccine induction of bNAbs will require two
critical steps. First, priming of the appropriate bNAb precursors that, due to unusual features, are rare in the
naïve human B-cell repertoire (3–5). Second, such precursors will need to be guided to acquire critical somatic
hypermutations that confer heterologous neutralization potency and breadth (6). While it is clear that bNAbs
evolve in natural HIV-1 infections through years of Env-antibody (Ab) coevolution, it is not clear how to trans-
late these findings to design immunogens that can reproducibly prime and mature bNAbs across multiple hosts
(1,5,7). In our last HIVRAD project, we developed a novel rhesus macaque (RM) SHIV infection model that re-
capitulated several key features of Env-bNAb coevolution (8,9). We also showed that prior vaccination and in-
fection with SHIVs bearing particular germline-targeting Envs could accelerate bNAb development. Thus, our
rhesus model system thus provides a unique setting where reproducible induction of bNAbs in (S)HIV infec-
tions can be studied. In this renewal, we will leverage this system to develop a vaccination and SHIV infection
strategy that will lead to development of V3 glycan bNAbs in an accelerated and reproducible manner across
multiple rhesus hosts. Our scientific premise is that a better understanding of the common Env-Ab coevolu-
tionary patterns leading to V3 glycan bNAb development will allow design of immunogens that can prime and
mature multiple V3 glycan bNAb lineages. Our Bioinformatics and Statistics Core (Core C) will provide bioin-
formatic and statistical modeling analyses to facilitate these overall HIVRAD goals. We will analyze Env evolu-
tion in SHIV-infected RMs from Project 1 by applying our novel computational pipeline to longitudinal se-
quence data generated by Core B. We will identify the similarities and differences between the neutralization
profiles of newly identified rhesus V3 glycan bNAbs (Project 1) and previously known V3 glycan bNAbs (Aim
2). Using the above two studies, we will iteratively design immunogens that are capable of engaging precur-
sors of multiple V3 glycan bNAb lineages and of maturing them towards neutralization breadth in collaboration
with Core B and Project 3 (Aim 3). Finally, we will provide statistical modeling of in vivo vaccine efficacy (Pro-
ject 1) and other complex biological problems across all Projects."
10808989,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 A major roadblock to rational HIV-1 vaccine design is the lack of a suitable primate model in which broadly
neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) can be consistently induced and the underlying molecular, biological and
immunological mechanisms studied in an iterative fashion. Since most HIV-1 bNAbs have come from humans
infected by HIV-1, we hypothesized that one means to elicit bNabs in primates might be by infecting rhesus
macaques (RMs) with simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) strains that bear primary or
transmitted/founder HIV-1 Envs, including those that induced bNAbs in humans. SHIV infected RMs could then
be employed to assess the potential of different HIV-1 Envs to elicit bNAbs and to characterize the coevolutionary
pathways of bNAb lineages and cognate Envs that elicited them, thereby serving as a “molecular guide” for
rational vaccine design. Recent innovations in SHIV design by our lab have made this experimental strategy
testable. In this renewal application, we show that 24 of 150, or 16%, of RMs infected by SHIVs bearing different
primary HIV-1 Envs developed bNAbs targeting V3 glycan, V2 apex, CD4bs or fusion peptide epitopes. Nine of
these animals developed V3 glycan bNAbs. From this extensive dataset, we identified HIV-1 CH848 and
BG505.N332 Envs as immunogens that most consistently elicited V3 glycan bNAbs in RMs. We further showed
that by reducing the length of V1 and the number of potential N-linked glycans in V1 (designated CH848.dV1
and BG505.N332.dV1), we could enhance the frequency and speed of induction of V3 glycan bNAbs in SHIV
infected RMs. Based on these findings, we propose in this project to test the hypothesis that infection of RMs
by SHIV.CH848.dV1 or SHIV.BG505.N332.dV1 will selectively prime V3 glycan bNAb lineage B cell precursors,
and through a process of Env-Ab coevolution, mature these responses to achieve neutralization breadth.
Moreover, by identifying evolved Env intermediates that select for V3 glycan bNAb affinity maturation, we can
design lineage-based Env immunogens that, when constructed as SOSIP Env trimers and used to immunize
outbred RMs, will elicit V3 glycan bNAbs that are protective against heterologous virus challenge. Specific Aims
are: (i) to decipher molecular pathways of Env-Ab coevolution in SHIV-infected RMs that lead to the development
of V3 glycan bNAbs, including the identification of inferred germline bNAb precursors, bNAb lineage
intermediates and evolved Env intermediates that select for affinity maturation and neutralization breadth; (ii) to
evaluate the ability of nanoparticle-delivered, germline-targeted CH848.dV1 and BG505.N332.dV1 SOSIP Env
trimers to prime V3 glycan bNAb lineage precursors and for subsequent homologous SHIV infection to select for
affinity maturation and neutralization breadth; and (iii) to conduct a statistically-powered, proof-of-concept
vaccine trial in RMs testing the hypothesis that germline-targeted, B lineage-designed SOSIP Env trimers can
prime, boost and affinity mature V3 glycan bNAb responses to an extent that is superior to conventional SOSIP
Env immunogens and that protects RMs from heterologous virus challenge."

Despite advances in neonatology, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) remains the most common GI emergency of
premature infants with significant morbidity and mortality. The pathophysiology of NEC is unclear, non-
surgical treatments are mainly supportive, and no predictive tests are currently available. In experimental
models of NEC, we have shown that bile acids (BA) play a critical role in NEC pathogenesis. Recently, using
prospectively collected, serial fecal samples from premature infants, we have shown that infants who develop
NEC have significantly higher coefficient of variation of total fecal bile acids (CV-TBA) than matched controls.
Importantly, these variations occur well prior of diagnosis. We hypothesize that variation of TBA can predict
development of NEC and aim to build and validate predictive models from daily fecal samples collected from
the NICUs at Banner University Medical Center - Tucson and Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Successful completion of this proposal could lead to implementation of the first predictive test for this
devastating disorder."

Cannabis is the third most commonly used substance in the United States (US), with almost half of all US
adults reporting lifetime use. Cannabis use is associated with physical harms (e.g., respiratory diseases),
psychological harms (e.g., cognitive deficits), and other types of harms (e.g., car crashes). Despite these
harms, many adults underestimate or do not know about the risks of cannabis use. Warning labels on cannabis
packages are a population-level intervention that can increase risk perceptions, knowledge, and recall of
cannabis harms, however, there is a lack of research on how cannabis warnings can be improved. Currently,
most US states with legalized cannabis require text-only cannabis warnings, but they are often placed on the
back of packages, are small (e.g., 6-point font), are wordy (e.g., more than 100 words), and read like a legal
disclaimer. As a result, current cannabis warnings are unnoticed, hard to read, and confusing. Accordingly, the
long-term goal of this research is to develop cannabis warnings that inform people about cannabis harms and
that states can implement into their cannabis warning regulations. The overall objective of this research is to
rigorously examine the current landscape of cannabis warning regulations and experimentally determine which
warning characteristics most effectively communicate the harms of cannabis use. The central hypothesis is
that large cannabis warnings with characteristics found to be promising (e.g., have icons, include colors) will
increase risk perceptions of cannabis harms. To accomplish our long-term goal and objective, the proposed
study will include three specific aims: Aim 1: Examine the legal and regulatory landscape of US cannabis
warnings; Aim 2: Develop a set of evidence-based cannabis warnings and identify which warning
characteristics increase perceived warning effectiveness; and Aim 3: Experimentally determine if large
cannabis warnings with characteristics found to be promising in Aim 2 increase risk perceptions, knowledge,
and recall of cannabis harms. Included within these aims are rigorous and innovative methods: a
comprehensive legal analysis, key informant interviews with cannabis regulators, an expert panel review,
online experiments, and a discrete choice experiment. Throughout the project, we will disseminate findings
from our study to regulators so that they can implement evidence-based warnings and impact change in the
cannabis regulatory landscape. This project is significant because each state that legalizes cannabis is tasked
with developing regulations on warning labels, but there is a lack of rigorous published research, especially
from the US, on the effectiveness of different cannabis warning themes (e.g., content), characteristics (e.g.,
text length, color) and format (e.g., size). Therefore, our project can help meet a critical need for a
comprehensive and rigorous evaluation of cannabis warnings. The proposed study directly addresses NIDA’s
priorities by assessing the impact of state-level policies on cannabis use as well as a Notice of Special Interest
on public policy effects on cannabis-related outcomes."

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is one of the defining medical challenges of the 21st century, with one in three Americans
born in 2000 estimated to develop diabetes in their lifetime. T2D is characterized by multi-organ insulin resistance
and perturbed whole-body glucose homeostasis. Over the past three decades, there have been hints that the
kidney plays a central pathophysiologic role in dysregulated whole-body glucose homeostasis in diabetes, with
a seminal study suggesting renal glucose production to be increased 300%, climbing to 85% that of the liver.
Notwithstanding, insulin resistance in the kidney has remained controversial and any potential mechanisms are
unknown. It would be of great public health interest to crystallize the mechanisms and precise pathophysiology
of insulin resistance in the kidney, as this may have myriad translational implications. In this proposal, we will
build upon our strong preliminary evidence that the renal cortex does, indeed, become insulin resistant with high
fat diet (HFD) feeding. In further preliminary data, we have observed both diacylglycerol (DAG) accumulation
and Protein Kinase Cε (PKCε) translocation in the mouse renal cortex, raising the possibility that diet-induced
renal insulin resistance may be mediated by a similar mechanism as in the liver, where high fat feeding leads to
DAG accumulation, which activates PKCε. PKCε subsequently phosphorylates insulin receptor (IR) at Thr1160,
causing abrogated insulin signaling. In this proposal, we will carefully assess the insulin signaling defects
associated with renal insulin resistance and also further characterize if there is aberrant DAG-PKCe-IR axis
activation. We will also use two novel 13C isotopic tracer strategies to understanding oxidative and gluconeogenic
defects in the insulin resistant renal cortex. Further, we will directly test the hypothesis that the DAG-PKCe-IR
axis causes renal insulin resistance by utilizing an already-generated mouse model where the critical Thr1160
residue of IR is mutated to an alanine, which cannot be phosphorylated by PKCε. We predict these mice will be
protected from signaling and metabolic flux manifestations of renal insulin resistance when fed a HFD. This
proposal represents an integrated scientific approach and new learning experiences that harness techniques of
physiology, cell biology, and analytical chemistry to yield novel insights into the mechanisms and
pathophysiology or renal insulin resistance."
10805380,"The proposed research examines the mechanisms underlying memory encoding versus storage deficits, in
typical and atypical AD at the stage of mild cognitive impairment, by delineating the specific roles of amyloid,
tau, and cortical atrophy as potential drivers of this impairment both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. A
long-term goal of the research program is to improve clinical prognostication and outcomes monitoring by
expanding our knowledge of the mechanisms of memory encoding impairment across the AD spectrum, with a
focus on better characterizing the atypical presentations of AD (i.e., posterior cortical atrophy; PCA, and
logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia; lvPPA). The proposal builds upon preliminary evidence
showing that memory encoding, in contrast to memory storage, relies on cortical networks outside the medial
temporal lobes in typical and atypical AD, and that auditory-verbal working memory deficits impact encoding
and retrieval, but not storage, in PCA. The candidate’s preliminary work also demonstrated that visual space
and face perception deficits, which may be critical contributors to memory encoding, are sensitive to AD-
related tau and atrophy in visual association regions in PCA and lvPPA. We will build on this preliminary work
by examining these processes in relation to different stages of memory (encoding vs storage), and in relation
to imaging biomarkers of AD pathology. The first aim is to examine the impact of visual or auditory-verbal
processing impairment on associative memory encoding and storage, in relation to tau and amyloid pathology,
across the spectrum of prodromal AD. The second aim is to investigate the mediating effect of cortical atrophy
and moderating factors, including age at symptom onset, that may explain this relationship between tau
pathology and memory. Short-term training goals for these aims include obtaining expertise in tau and amyloid
PET processing that will further the candidate's long-term goal of utilizing multimodal neuroimaging with
cognitive outcome measures to prognosticate disease course across the AD phenotypic spectrum. The third
aim is to determine the longitudinal impact of tau spread on atrophy and progressive memory decline across
the spectrum of prodromal AD. Training for this aim will extend the candidate's expertise into longitudinal
biostatistical analysis, including morphometric analyses to quantify and control for the effect of gray matter loss
in the prodromal AD population. All aims will utilize data collected from the novel associative memory tasks
outlined in the proposed project. All other clinical and neuroimaging data will be provided by the primary
mentor’s NIH-funded studies. Training available at Massachusetts General Hospital and the Harvard Medical
School community allows access to resources and mentorship in the specific techniques necessary to the
completion of the proposed aims and the candidate's training and career goals."
10805504,"Tuberculous (TB) meningitis is a serious, life-threatening disease affecting vulnerable populations including
HIV-infected individuals and young children. Early diagnosis is challenging and outcomes are poor even with
prolonged antimicrobial treatment (≥12 months). Although several key antimicrobials have limited central
nervous system (CNS) penetration and immunopathology is the major driver of neurological damage,
pulmonary TB is still used as the treatment paradigm, with limited efforts to utilize preclinical models of TB
meningitis to optimize treatment.
 We have developed a rabbit model of TB meningitis that replicates key neuropathological features of
human disease. Additionally, we have developed several novel, clinically translatable positron emission
tomography (PET) tracers to perform holistic, unbiased and noninvasive measurements of pathophysiological
processes in live animals. These include 124I-DPA-713 for cerebral inflammation, 11C-rifampin, 76Br-bedaquiline
and 18F-linezolid to measure antimicrobial penetration into the CNS, benzothiazinone (BTZ) analogs to directly
detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis and 18F-albumin / 11C-verapamil to study blood-brain barrier (BBB)
permeability / drug efflux transporter activity respectively. Given the importance of rifampin for the treatment of
TB meningitis, we performed detailed pharmacokinetic (PK) studies using dynamic 11C-rifampin PET in rabbits
and humans (Tucker et al. Sci Transl Med 2018). We demonstrate that rifampin penetration (area under the
curve) into infected-brain lesions is limited, spatially heterogeneous and substantially decreases within two
weeks of starting treatment (32% to 11%). Importantly, rifampin concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) do
not correlate well with those in infected-brain lesions. First-in-human 11C-rifampin PET in a TB meningitis
patient was safe, well tolerated and demonstrated similar limited and heterogeneous rifampin penetration.
 We will utilize these novel imaging tools in the rabbit model to provide mechanistic insights into TB
meningitis and key information to optimize treatments: a) measure the penetration of novel TB drugs, including
those active against multi-drug resistant TB, into infected-brain lesions as well as provide insights into the
relevance of discordant CSF and brain tissue levels; b) compare linezolid and high-dose rifampin based
regimens and elucidate the role of BBB permeability and efflux transporters in drug exposures in the CNS; c)
perform longitudinal multi-modality imaging to simultaneously visualize intralesional bacterial burden,
inflammation and antimicrobial exposure during TB treatments in live animals to correlate the effect of
intracerebral inflammatory responses and antimicrobial exposures with the treatment outcome. These
assessments are not feasible with current technologies that require resected tissues. This proposal fulfills an
important gap in TB drug development and treatment optimization for a devastating disease affecting
vulnerable populations."
10805508,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Emotionally traumatic experiences can lead to maladaptive memories that are enduring and intrusive. The goal
of exposure-based therapies is to extinguish conditioned fears through repeated, unreinforced exposures to
reminders of traumatic events. The extinction of conditioned fear depends upon the consolidation of new
memories made during exposure to reminders. An impairment in extinction recall, observed in certain patient
populations, can interfere with progress in exposure-based therapies, and the drive to avoid thoughts and
reminders of the trauma can undermine compliance and increase dropout rate. Development of an effective
adjunctive therapy would ideally improve the tolerability of therapy and/or improve the consolidation and
maintenance of the extinction memory.
We have recently demonstrated in rats that, compared to exposure alone, exposure paired with vagus nerve
stimulation (VNS) enhances the extinction of fear-based memories. Under stressful conditions, the vagus nerve
responds to elevations in epinephrine and signals the brain to facilitate the storage of new memories while, as
part of the parasympathetic nervous system, it slows the sympathetic “fight-or-flight” response. We propose that
stimulation of the left cervical vagus nerve during exposure to conditioned cues signals the brain to store new
memories just as epinephrine or emotional arousal would do but bypasses the peripheral sympathetic response.
In support of this hypothesis, we have found that VNS accelerates extinction, reverses extinction impairments,
promotes generalization of extinction, and prevents reinstatement of conditioned fear in rats.
VNS is thought to work by increasing the activity of neuromodulators throughout the brain, producing a synaptic
state that is conducive to plasticity. In particular, the locus coruleus (LC) is thought to play a critical role in VNS
efficacy by supplying noradrenergic input directly to multiple regions of the extinction network, including the
prefrontal cortex (PFC), the basolateral amygdala (BLA), and the hippocampus (HIP). Here, we propose
behavioral experiments designed to evaluate whether VNS produces more persistent and generalized extinction
memories, which would provide important preclinical evidence that VNS could be an effective adjunct to
exposure-based therapies. To elucidate the mechanisms by which VNS promotes its effects, we propose to
optogenetically manipulate the LC, and to simultaneously record from PFC, BLA, and HIP during conditioning,
extinction, and post-extinction behavioral testing.
By increasing our understanding of the mechanisms by which VNS enhances extinction of conditioned fear,
these studies will support treatment development for patients, and provide new fundamental insights into
the neuromodulatory mechanisms of LC signaling on extinction-related plasticity."
10805509,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Child physical abuse is a significant source of childhood morbidity and mortality, and preventable healthcare
costs. Each year, in the US, more than 120,000 children are determined to have suffered physical abuse,
resulting in hundreds of deaths and tens of thousands with long-term physical and psychological morbidity,
with billions of dollars in healthcare costs and lost productivity. For decades, abuse research has had a
dramatic deficit of resources and investigators. In 2013, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) report “New Directions
in Child Abuse and Neglect Research” called for new, sophisticated, multidisciplinary research infrastructure –
specifically citing the need for additional multi-center research. The report also highlighted the need to create
uniform definitions and measures that could link data across multiple professions, and to recruit a new cadre of
capable investigators. Since the publication of the IOM's report, the child abuse pediatrics community has
worked to lay the foundation for a sustainable research network for child abuse (CAPNET), and has succeeded
in: establishing a network structure; ratifying governance documents; drafting pilot common data elements
(CDEs); identifying an initial research agenda; and establishing an annual research training institute.
This application proposes to leverage these accomplishments by creating sustainable data resources to launch
CAPNET as a resource for the wider abuse research community. The resources created by this application will
allow multi-center data collection, storage, quality assurance and sharing for abuse researchers across the
career spectrum. Our specific aims are: Aim 1: Refine, pilot and implement a web-based, multicenter data
collection and quality assurance system for child abuse research. We will refine draft CDEs to ensure feasible,
reliable data collection and cross-specialty data linkage. A data coordinating center will oversee data
management, quality, and compliance, using a central IRB. These resources will produce a robust data,
available to the wider research community, containing core clinical data from several thousand abuse
evaluations from nine participating centers. Aim 2: Coordinate sharing and facilitate scholarly use of multi-
center data. We will use data sharing agreements, in-person and distance meetings, pilot grants, innovative
networking and mentorship and transparent performance metrics to nurture researchers across the career
continuum. Aim 3: Begin expansion of CAPNET to include child welfare. We will use community engagement
and consensus-building methods to develop the relationships needed, and to identify the priority research
themes and data domains to address the next phase of collaborative medical and child welfare research.
Each resource created by this application will benefit the wider research community, ultimately resulting in
increased research capacity, decreased care disparities and improved outcomes for abused children."

The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is essential for normal embryonic development and when perturbed,
frequently results in human disease, including those that impact development of the craniofacial complex. The
Gli transcription factors are the downstream effectors of the pathway and have been the subject of much research
as they are associated with a number of craniofacial syndromes (e.g., Grieg cephalopolysyndactyly) and can
function as both transcriptional activators and repressors of the Hh pathway. Gli3 is most stable and abundant
as a repressor. Despite this, our recent work identified a specific and necessary role for Gli3 activator (Gli3A)
function during normal development of the mandible that requires additional regulatory inputs to convey a robust
Gli3A response. Little is known regarding what is required for Gli3, as a bimodal transcription factor, to function
as a potent activator during development. To address existing knowledge gaps in how full-length Gli3 is
converted into an activator, we engineered a set of endogenously epitope tagged alleles for Gli3. With these
novel tools we propose to: (Aim1) determine if/how chromatin accessibility modulates Gli3A function; (Aim2)
investigate the role of co-factors and regulatory grammar in regulating enhancer output; and (Aim3) unbiasedly
identify protein interactors of Gli3A within the nucleus. We will focus on craniofacial development, specifically
development of the mandible, as a relevant model for testing these principles given the requirement for Gli
activity during glossogenesis and mandibular skeletogenesis. This developmental system will allow us to
determine the requirement for chromatin accessibility, exhaustively interrogate the regulatory grammar, and
identify the constituents of the Gli3 activator complex. Recent technological advances will enable hypothesis
testing through single-cell analysis of chromatin accessibility and transcription profiles from mutants predicted to
have pioneering activity. To validate our findings, we will perform in vivo experiments to test enhancer activity
and apply CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis to functionally assess native binding site requirements. Collectively, our
studies will shed light on the regulatory principles governing Gli-directed cellular programs that when disrupted
can result in range of human disorders ranging from structural birth defects to cancer. Understanding how these
programs are deployed and interpreted during normal development has the potential to improve human health
through the expansion of therapeutic interventions that can help mitigate pathway dysregulation."
10805512,"Summary
Significance: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infects ~260 million people worldwide and is the leading cause of liver
disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the world. Despite an effective vaccine for infection prevention,
chronic hepatitis B virus infection (CHB) is difficult to cure once established. The viral genetic material enters
the infected cell's nucleus generating a stable covalently closed-circular DNA (cccDNA) molecule or a linear
form that integrates into the host cell's chromosome (iDNA). Existing treatments have little effect on cccDNA
and as a result have poor success rates. Treatment interruption often leads to rebound of HBV DNA and
recurrent hepatitis. In addition, even with treatment, liver disease in CHB often progresses to decompensated
cirrhosis requiring liver transplantation. This process is exacerbated by several viral co-infections, such as with
HIV or hepatitis C virus (HCV). Thus, improved therapeutics for CHB cure are required.
Innovation: Our proposal is innovative in three aspects. i) access to precious and unique samples of liver
tissue; ii) using state-of-the-art experimental techniques for single cell analyses and contemporaneous blood
biomarkers; iii) development of new multi-scale models of HBV infection informed by our rich data sets, which
are designed for clinical usefulness.
Approach: HBV has a complex lifecycle comprising intracellular and extracellular phases. Our team has
developed tools to interrogate the intracellular phase of HBV at the single-hepatocyte level. We have made
preliminary observations of HBV in single cells but have only recently begun to link the intracellular and
extracellular phases of HBV. Thus, we are poised to uncover key links in HBV biology between blood and liver.
Using an integrated approach, we propose developing models of HBV that characterize replication in the
organism uniting our understanding of intracellular and extracellular phases of the virus. Our specific aims are:
i) To develop integrated models of intracellular and extracellular HBV replication, measuring and
modeling a comprehensive set of HBV-related biomarkers in the blood and at the single-cell level in the liver, in
untreated and treated CHB; and ii) To develop models of HBV spatial spread and persistence in the liver,
using single-cell viral sequencing of HBV to make spatial linkages between genetically related HBV variants in
the liver. These data and models will allow inferences about local versus non-local HBV spread. Specifically,
we will test if clonal proliferation of HBV infected hepatocytes may contribute to continued persistence of
infected cells, which has important implications not only for cure research but also for HCC oncogenesis.
Impact: As multiple novel compounds for HBV treatment are in development, the timely insights generated in
this proposal will fill gaps in our understanding of HBV replication and pathogenesis. Previous efforts by us and
others in modeling HCV and HIV were important in the development of successful therapies for those
infections. We expect the new data and models generated here to have the same impact in advancing HBV
therapy."

The development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a complex process, with obesity being a major risk factor.
Weight loss among overweight/obese individuals is a key component of the primary prevention of CVD, but
there is marked variability across individuals in response to lifestyle weight loss interventions. It is critical to
improve our understanding of drivers of weight loss responsiveness as this may help identify causal factors in
obesity and may ultimately lead to new or more personalized prevention or treatment opportunities. This study
will examine how genetics, gut microbiota (GM), and metabolites contribute towards measures of
responsiveness during an ongoing 1-year lifestyle weight loss trial of the standard weight loss approach, daily
caloric restriction (DCR), versus a novel alternative, intermittent fasting (IMF). This understanding of the causal
relationships between omic profiles and weight loss/health improvements in an interventional setting will target
an investigation into GM and metabolites as mediators of the association between genetic obesity risk and
obesity-related phenotypes in larger epidemiological cohorts. Preliminary data from a participant subset in the
intervention that provides evidence of feasibility and informs the hypotheses for the following innovative aims:
Aim 1: Assess longitudinal changes in GM and metabolites, as well as the predominant drivers of these
changes, during a lifestyle weight loss intervention of DCR versus IMF. Aim 2: Evaluate associations of a
measure of genetic risk for obesity and GM/metabolites with responsiveness during a lifestyle weight loss
intervention. Aim 3: Investigate whether GM/metabolites mediate the association between a multiethnic
obesity polygenic risk score and measures of obesity in two epidemiological cohorts.
This Career Development Award will also provide the Candidate with the opportunity to gain important skills
and expertise. She has a clear plan to gain training related to: 1) processing shotgun metagenomic GM and
metabolomic data; 2) causal inference and other relevant methods for the analysis of multi-omics data; and 3)
multiethnic polygenic risk scores. The training plan involves coursework, conference attendance, and in-person
training with leading scholars, in conjunction with guidance from a mentorship team of renowned leaders in
their respective fields of genetic epidemiology (Dr. Leslie Lange; Primary Mentor), bioinformatics and the
human gut microbiome (Dr. Catherine Lozupone), biostatistics (Dr. Katerina Kechris), and clinical weight loss
interventions (Dr. Victoria Catenacci). This training plan combines the exceptional research environment at the
University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus with generous institutional support and ample resources, as
well as an outstanding network of advisors. This work will facilitate the candidate's successful transition to an
independent career in molecular epidemiology with the expertise to integrate complex types of omics data in
order to improve our understanding of disease pathophysiology and to inform innovative prevention and
intervention efforts for obesity and CVD."
10792941,"Goal-directed behavior requires selection of signals from the external and internal emotional environments based on memory and prior experience for action. Processes that rely on emotions and memory engage the network of medial frontal area 25 and medial temporal lobe (MTL) cortices, which are affected in psychiatric diseases.

Pathways will be studied in the context of the excitatory and inhibitory neuronal composition in both monkeys and humans, which critically affects function and disruption in brain diseases. Our overarching hypothesis is that the Structural Model, which predicts the patterns and strength of cortical connections studied in non-human primates, apply for study of the human brain and can be applied to understand the circuit basis of the involvement of subgenual area 25 and MTL in depression. The goal of the proposed studies is to use high resolution connections in monkeys to investigate the circuit mechanisms between medial prefrontal A25 and MTL areas through study of: (1) The synaptic targets of frontal area 25 to MTL area 28 in monkeys, and the excitatory-inhibitory neuronal composition of the respective areas in both monkeys and humans; (2) Laminar connections within MTL in monkeys and their relationship to the local architecture; (3) The normal excitatory and inhibitory neuronal and glial make-up of frontal area 25 in monkeys and humans, based on evidence that hyperactivity in area 25 perturbs function in depression; and (4) The density of axons below area 25 in human control brains, which give rise to bidirectional pathways that link it with nearby prefrontal and distant cortices. Hypotheses about pathway relationships are based on the theoretical and data based Structural Model, in the context of principles of excitatory and inhibitory control in primates. Pathways in rhesus monkeys will be labeled with distinct neural tracers, combined with multiple labeling for inhibitory neurons and receptors. Quantitative data will be obtained using correlated light, confocal and electron microscopy and analyzed using advanced statistical methods and synthesized through modeling. Findings will establish the still unknown circuit interactions of medial prefrontal areas and MTL, and their likely involvement in depression, which perturbs the excitation-inhibition balance and the processes of interoception, emotion and memory."

To enhance the Johns Hopkins University pigtail macaque colony as a research resource for studying multiple
facets of HIV infection, we have concentrated on improving our understanding of pigtail macaque (Macaca
nemestrina) genetics. We continue to identify and study pigtail macaque MHC class I and MHC class II alleles
using state of the art next generation sequencing approaches working in collaboration with Dr. David O'Connor
at the University of Wisconsin. This ongoing effort has discovered novel MHC alleles and defined MHC class I
haplotypes in pigtail macaques. To broaden the scope of our efforts beyond MHC, we have worked with Dr.
Michael Snyder's team at Stanford to generate a de novo assembly of the pigtail macaque genome that used
long-read sequencing technology. This pigtail macaque resource will facilitate use of functional genomics
approaches in SIV studies. Expanding the genetic data available for pigtail macaques will a) increase the
research utility of pigtail macaques and b) assist in genetic management of the JHU colony with guidance from
Dr. Sree Kanthaswamy, a long term collaborator. These goals will be accomplished through two aims under
the direction of Dr. Mankowski. Specific Aim 1 is to continue to characterize pigtail macaque MHC class I and
MHC class II genotypes in JHU colony-born animals using state of the art deep sequencing approaches,
thereby enhancing rigor and reproducibility of SIV/macaque models of HIV. Specific Aim 2 is to improve our
de novo long-read sequencing assembly of the pigtail macaque genome to increase the research value of this
macaque species by enabling functional genomic approaches."
10791018,"The ability to withstand sudden spikes in acidity gives Streptococcus mutans, the principle causative agent of
dental caries, a growth advantage over acid-sensitive oral bacteria. In most bacteria, non-coding small RNAs
(sRNAs) regulate biochemical pathways that respond to environmental stress such as sudden exposure to acidity.
However, the potential roles sRNAs play in mitigating acid stress in S. mutans are unknown. Our long-term goal
is to define the functions of non-coding RNAs in S. mutans and to apply this knowledge to develop novel ap-
proaches to prevent and treat dental caries. Towards attaining this goal, the objective of this application is to
define sRNAs that promote acid stress resistance in S. mutans. We recently identified 15 novel sRNAs in S. mu-
tans and discovered that the expression of several were significantly altered when the bacterium was exposed to
acidity. Based on this data, the central hypothesis of this project is that sRNAs are key regulators of S. mutans’s
acid stress response. The rationale for the proposed research is that sRNA-based gene expression control repre-
sent a largely untapped reservoir of therapeutic targets that could be exploited to control dental caries. To test
our central hypothesis, in the first aim, we will define the functions of two putative acid-responding sRNAs by
combining genetic approaches with in vivo RNA-crosslinking and biochemical analyses. In the second aim, using
a highly effective sRNA discovery protocol, we will conduct a comprehensive search for acid-responsive sRNAs
in S. mutans by exposing the bacterium to a range of acidic conditions. With the successful completion of this
project, the expected outcomes include a catalog of novel acid-responding sRNAs in S. mutans and new mecha-
nistic models of sRNA function in mitigating acid stress. This work is expected to have a significant impact be-
cause it will reveal new insights into the molecular mechanisms that underpin S. mutans’s ability to overcome
acid-induced stress, thereby providing new avenues to control dental caries by disrupting acid-response path-
ways."
10794301,"The overarching goal of the Clinical & Population Science Core (Clinical Core) is to accelerate data-driven
solutions to the persistent challenges of domestic and global TB control. To meet this goal, the Core’s strategic
imperative is to promote innovative research on TB by fostering new collaborations and by expanding existing
collaborations among scientists across diverse disciplines at Emory University, University of Georgia (UGA),
other partner institutions in Georgia, and internationally.
 A major strength of the Emory/Georgia TRAC is our long-standing, productive research partnerships with
both international (Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenya, South Africa, Philippines, and the country of Georgia) and
domestic sites (DeKalb and Fulton County Boards of Health; U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention). These research sites provide clinical care to diverse patient populations, have state-of-the-art
laboratories and data management systems, and are directly engaged in translating research into policy at the
local, national, and global levels. Clinical Core faculty are world-renowned TB scientists with successful track
records of leading impactful clinical and epidemiologic research in TB/HIV, drug-resistant TB, TB transmission,
pediatric TB, TB/diabetes, and post-TB lung health. Their cutting-edge work has integrated innovative
epidemiologic and biostatistical methods to advance our approach to TB research, including geospatial
methods, network analysis, bias analysis, epidemic modeling, and molecular epidemiology. This extensive
research portfolio also provides investigators with access to curated research databases, organized specimen
repositories, and field-tested study instruments. The Clinical Core will leverage these resources and expertise
to enable the conduct of scientifically rigorous, multi-disciplinary TB research by early stage investigators and
established investigators new to TB. In this way, the Core will catalyze the next generation of TB researchers,
improve our understanding of TB, and support the needs of new and emerging science.
 In three integrated Aims, the Clinical Core will support high-impact research by facilitating access to
diverse study populations at international and domestic clinical research sites through a comprehensive
program that will introduce, establish, and nurture relationships between TRAC investigators, our collaborating
partners, and early-stage and established investigators new to TB. The Core will provide consultation and
training to investigators undertaking new clinical, epidemiologic, or translational research in TB through end-to-
end support for study planning, implementation, and dissemination. The Core will develop a centralized
repository of research data and associated Mtb isolates and specimens that links with the Basic Science Core
biorepository, providing numerous opportunities for innovative clinical and translational analyses. The long-
term goal of the Core is to cultivate a robust TB clinical research environment that is accessible, impactful, and
collaborative to grow the pool of TB investigators conducting transformative research within the TRAC."
10794303,"The Basic & Translational Science (Basic Science) Core of the Emory/Georgia TRAC will provide expertise
and resources to facilitate TRAC investigator-led studies of mycobacterial pathogenesis, transmission, and
host immunity in both human and animal models of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. The Basic
Science Core will capitalize on a unique set of resources available to the TRAC community, including the
Yerkes National Primate Research Center with capacity to conduct Mtb studies in rodents and nonhuman
primates, and the University of Georgia Animal Health Research Center with extensive animal BSL3 lab space
and capacity to conduct mycobacterial infection and vaccination studies in a variety of large, medium, and
small animals. The overall mission of the Basic Science Core is to provide laboratory expertise, training, and
resources to catalyze opportunities for innovative multidisciplinary and highly collaborative TB research
programs engaging Basic Science Core faculty, early-stage investigators, and established investigators who
are new to the TB field. The Core will achieve these goals by providing training, consultation, and services with
state-of-the-art laboratory equipment, facilities, and methods, including the newest immunological and
microbiological assays and animal Mtb infection models, in addition to providing a quality-controlled central
repository of materials for the TRAC community. In Aim 1, consultation in experimental design and laboratory
assay approaches will be provided to investigators who are planning basic and translational science studies of
Mtb. Specific training areas will include Mtb culture and in vitro infection; Mtb infection of animals; and lab
assay training, data interpretation, and protocol development. In Aim 2, the Core will provide support to TRAC
investigators to generate preliminary laboratory-based data for internal and external funding applications;
conduct laboratory assays and animal Mtb infection and vaccination studies in support of TRAC-series
Developmental awards and other funded projects; and support the development of new microbiology and
immunology laboratory-based assays. In Aim 3, a biorepository and electronic database will be established for
archiving clinical specimens and isolates from human cohorts across a range of Mtb infection and disease
states; specimens from Mtb-infected and control animals; and common Mtb laboratory strains for use by TRAC
investigators. In summary, the Basic Science Core will provide value-added activities in training, services, and
materials to Emory/Georgia TRAC investigators, with the overall goal of supporting TRAC investigators to
successfully establish and expand innovative research programs filling critical knowledge gaps in TB
pathogenesis, transmission, and immunity to more effectively combat the global TB pandemic."
10794306,"The Bioinformatics and Integrated Systems Biology (Systems Biology) Core will represent an integral
component of the Emory/Georgia TRAC. While individual members of the Emory/Georgia TB research
community have strong records of collaborative TB research, access to cutting edge methods in systems
biology have not been easily accessible. Although the partner institutions of the Emory/Georgia TRAC host a
wide variety of Core facilities performing ‘-omics’ assays, expertise in computational biology needed to analyze
and integrate the high-dimensional, multiscale data sets produced by these platforms is often not readily
available. We propose to provide essential support for high-dimensional, multiscale data analysis and
integration to facilitate use of ‘-omics’ technologies among Emory/Georgia TRAC investigators. The Systems
Biology Core will accomplish this by serving as a single point of contact (concierge function) to investigators of
the Emory/Georgia TRAC, and facilitating access to a wide array of ‘-omics’ technologies for specific
experimental designs. Using established computational pipelines, we will provide training to new investigators
on methods in high-dimensional data analysis and data integration in this increasingly essential area of basic
and translational research. The specific aims of the BISB Core are: 1) to provide a single point of contact
structure for data acquisition, management, and analysis for all ‘-omics’ platforms to TRAC investigators; 2) To
provide training and educational resources to TRAC members to carry out cutting edge experiments using ‘-
omics’ technologies and implement associated computational pipelines; and 3) to develop and implement
novel multiomics assays and associated computational models to advance TB research. We will strive to
nurture a collaborative research environment among Emory/Georgia TRAC investigators by facilitating the use
and implementation of cutting edge multiomics assays to advance TB research and train the next generation of
TB researchers."
10794234,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Hospitals ineffectively examine the safety of their processes by relying on voluntary incident reporting (VIR) by
clinical staff who are overworked and afraid to report. VIR captures only 1-10% of events, excludes patients
and families, and underdetects events in vulnerable groups like patients with language barriers. Patients and
families are vigilant partners in care who are adept at identifying errors and AEs. Failing to actively include pa-
tients and families in safety reporting and instead relying on flawed VIR presents an important missed oppor-
tunity to improve safety. To improve hospital safety, there is a critical need to coproduce (create in partnership
with families) effective systems to identify uncaptured errors. Without this information, hospitals are impeded in
their ability to improve patient safety. In partnership with diverse families, nurses, physicians, and hospital lead-
ers, we created a multicomponent communication intervention to engage families of hospitalized children in
safety reporting. Known as FACES (“Family Activation and Communication about Errors and Safety”), the in-
tervention includes 3 elements: (1) a Spanish and English mobile (email, text, and QR-code) FACES reporting
tool prompting families to share concerns and suggestions about safety, (2) family/staff education, and (3) a
process for sharing family reports with the unit and hospital so systemic issues can be addressed. After pilot-
ing FACES in one inpatient unit, we saw marked improvements in family safety reporting and reductions in dis-
parities in reporting by parent education and language. We now propose to conduct an RCT of FACES in 4
geographically, ethnically, and linguistically diverse hospitals. Our specific aims are to: (1) evaluate the effec-
tiveness of FACES in improving error detection and other safety outcomes, (2) assess the impact of FACES on
disparities in reporting, and (3) understand contextual factors contributing to successful implementation of
FACES. If effective, FACES will contribute by: (1) increasing patient/family engagement in reporting, espe-
cially from vulnerable groups, (2) identifying otherwise unrecognized events, and (3) enabling hospitals to bet-
ter understand safety problems in a 360-degree manner and design more effective, patient-centered solutions.
This is significant because hospitals need to identify medical errors reliably in order to improve patient safety.
The proposed research is innovative because it extends family safety reporting from the research to the oper-
ational real-world context; compares patient/family safety reporting to flawed existing VIR; and is informed by
principles of coproduction, communication science, health literacy, and organizational behavior. It also involves
a novel strategy to share learnings, ensuring concerns are acted upon to improve patient safety in a manner
that matters to patients and families. Finally, it focuses on the intersection between safety and equity. This
study will achieve our long-term objective to coproduce with families evidence-based strategies to make hos-
pital care safer, higher quality, and more equitable, in line with AHRQ's mission. It intersects multiple priorities
highlighted by AHRQ, including children (a priority population), safety, and equity (SEN NOT-HS-21-014)."
10794235,"Summary
 Venous thromboembolism (VTE) has been called the single leading cause of preventable harm in
hospitalized patients by AHRQ. Numerous studies have focused on improving prescription of VTE prophylaxis
medication for hospitalized patients; however, prescription does not ensure administration. We found that VTE
prophylaxis medication nonadherence among hospitalize patients is highly prevalent; on some floors patients
miss only 5% of doses and on others nearly 40%. The most frequently documented reason for non-
administration is patient refusal. Among patients with preventable VTE (defined as VTE in patients not
receiving prophylaxis), the majority (72%) were prescribed optimal prophylaxis but missed one or more doses.
 Classically, interventions targeting medication nonadherence have been focused exclusively on outpatient
settings, limiting their generalizability to hospitalized patients. In 2013, we were funded by the Patient Centered
Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) to develop and deliver a patient-centered, evidence-based intervention
bundle in real-time using transactional electronic health record data to improve adherence to prescribed VTE
prophylaxis for hospitalized patients. The goal of this intervention was to empower patients to make informed
decisions about their VTE preventive care and improve VTE prophylaxis medication adherence in hospitalized
patients in heterogeneous environments. Our research study showed significant improvement, with a 40%
decline of nonadministration of pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis doses, and a 50% reduction in patient refusal.
We further tested this intervention in a real-world setting where charge nurses on 8 different floors were given
the patient education bundle to deliver; nonadherence decreased 47% and patient refusal decreased by 57%.
 We will scale up our intervention across diverse hospital settings, including a major academic medical
centers and two community hospitals. Between these hospitals, VTE medication nonadherence ranges from
8.8% to 17.8%. We will deliver interactive, online, scenario-based education to frontline nurses regarding the
importance of VTE prevention for hospitalized patients and will engage hospitalized patients who are at highest
risk of VTE prophylaxis medication nonadherence using a patient-centered education intervention bundle. Our
primary outcome is the proportion of administered VTE prophylaxis medication doses. Our secondary
outcomes include the incidence of patient refusal for VTE prophylaxis medication, incidence of hospital-
associated VTE using the validated AHRQ Patient Safety Indicator-12, and the proportion of patients with VTE
who miss doses of prescribed prophylaxis.
 Successful completion of the proposed research will empower patients to make informed decisions about
their VTE preventive care, increase VTE prophylaxis medication adherence, and improve delivery of patient-
centered, defect-free VTE prevention to hospitalized patients across heterogeneous clinical settings."
10794339,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Heart failure (HF) is an important public health concern, affecting over 6 million individuals in the United States
alone. HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is now the leading form of HF and the prevalence
continues to rise. HFpEF remains a therapeutic challenge, given our limited understanding of causal and
contributing factors, clinical heterogeneity within HFpEF subphenotypes, and lack of available therapies.
HFpEF is far more prevalent in women than men, driven in part by sex differences in cardiac structure and
remodeling, adaptations to physiologic stress, and comorbidity burden. Emerging data support the role of
systemic inflammation in the pathogenesis of HFpEF and sex differences in immune response have led many
to hypothesize that inflammation is an important driver of the female susceptibility to HFpEF. A better
understanding of these sex differences may offer critical insights into disease pathogenesis, particularly in light
of recent evidence highlighting potential therapeutic benefit of sacubitril/valsartan preferentially in women with
HFpEF. To date, investigations of inflammation in HFpEF have been limited to downstream markers of
inflammation. Eicosanoids are small bioactive lipids that regulate the upstream initiation of systemic
inflammation in humans. Advanced methods using mass spectrometry now allow for the rapid and accurate
quantification of >150 upstream eicosanoid mediators. We will leverage this state-of-the-art technology to
provide a more detailed understanding of how biologic sex differences in upstream eicosanoid pathways
contribute to HFpEF risk and disease progression. In Aim 1, we will examine sex differences in the association
of circulating eicosanoids with clinical antecedents of HFpEF as well as incident HFpEF in the community. In
Aim 2, we will evaluate the association of eicosanoid analytes with cardiac and extra-cardiac responses to
exercise in men and women with clinical HFpEF. In Aim 3, we will conduct a prospective observational study to
investigate the changes in inflammatory profiles and endothelial cell inflammation as ascertained by eicosanoid
metabolites and endothelial cell gene expression profiling through the menopausal transition in women and
age-matched men at risk for developing HFpEF. The overarching goal of this proposal is to evaluate the
hypothesis that sex differences in systemic inflammation may account for observed differences in HFpEF risk
and disease manifestations in men and women. This research will be accomplished in the setting of a
comprehensive career development program designed to provide Dr. Lau, an early career investigator, with the
skills needed to become an independent physician-scientist in women’s cardiovascular (CV) health. Her long-
term career goal is to identify biologic sex differences that contribute to CV risk and disease in order to refine
prevention and therapeutic strategies for women with CV disease. This proposal brings together a unique
interdisciplinary advisory team of experts in the fields of metabolomics, gene expression profiling, women’s
health, and advanced biostatistics that will guide the candidate in her transition to scientific independence."
10794343,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a health epidemic that increases risk of death due to cardiovascular disease.
Hyperphosphatemia and elevations in serum levels of the hormone fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 23 are a
hallmark of CKD and associated with an increased risk of cardiac injury and death. We previously found that in
rodents, hyperphosphatemia induced by the administration of a high-phosphate diet elevates serum FGF23
levels and causes cardiac hypertrophy in the absence of kidney damage, suggesting that elevated phosphate
and/or FGF23 per se might act as circulating factors that can damage the heart. However, whether phosphate
or FGF23 can directly target the heart and induce injury is unknown. FGF23 is mainly produced by bone, and
we previously found that FGF23 can activate specific signaling events in cultured cardiac myocytes and induce
hypertrophy. However, whether FGF23 can directly target cardiac myocytes in vivo remains unknown. Based on
global FGFR4 deletion and pharmacological FGFR4 inhibition studies, we have recently identified FGFR4 as the
FGF23 receptor that is required for the development of cardiac hypertrophy in animal models of CKD as well as
in mice on high-phosphate diet. For the proposed study we have generated a novel mouse model for the cardiac
myocyte-specific deletion of FGFR4. By inducing CKD via an adenine diet or by administration of a high-
phosphate diet, we will be able to determine whether FGF23/FGFR4 activation in the heart is required for the
development of cardiac injury. Furthermore, direct effects of phosphate on cardiac myocytes have not been
studied to date. Our preliminary work indicates that elevations of extracellular phosphate levels in cardiac
myocyte cultures induce pro-inflammatory signaling and osteogenic gene programs. Here we will determine
whether these changes lead to pathologic cardiac remodeling in mice, including cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis,
inflammation and calcification. We also found that phosphate treatments of cultured cardiac myocytes induce
the expression of FGF23 that under normal conditions is not found in the heart. It has been reported that in CKD
the heart starts to produce FGF23. However, whether heart-derived FGF23 can cause cardiac remodeling, is
unclear. To determine the consequences of cardiac FGF23 production, we will generate a new mouse model
with cardiac myocyte-specific deletion of FGF23, followed by the administration of high-phosphate or adenine
diets, and a detailed analysis of cardiac structure and function. Overall, our study is designed to test the
hypothesis that hyperphosphatemia - by itself as well as in the context of CKD - contributes to cardiac injury by
inducing FGF23 production in the heart. FGF23 is a potent pro-hypertrophic factor, and like circulating FGF23,
paracrine FGF23 might directly target cardiac myocytes via FGFR4 and induce cardiac injury. We postulate that
pharmacologic blockade of FGFR4 can inhibit the pathologic actions of FGF23 on the heart and thereby serve
as a novel therapeutic strategy to prevent or treat CKD-associated cardiac injury and prolong survival."
10794944,"Our ability to produce neurons from pluripotent stem cells holds great promise for studying the assembly,
function, and dysfunction of the nervous system in experimentally accessible settings. While there has been a
dramatic advance in the development of new protocols for differentiation of stem cells into increasingly diverse
types of neurons, stem cell-derived neurons fail to acquire a fully mature neuronal identity. In order to study the
function of mature nerve cells and to model adult onset neurodegenerative disorders in a more relevant context,
it is paramount to develop methodologies that yield nerve cells more closely resembling those found in the adult
CNS. Towards this goal, we will perform a longitudinal study of gene expression and chromatin changes in
primary motor neurons in the mouse spinal cord. We will identify enhancers that control mature gene expression
programs and develop methods for reprograming immature stem cell-derived motor neurons to a mature state.
This work will impact three important areas: 1) it will provide the first detailed analysis of gene expression
changes associated with motor neuron maturation in vivo, 2) it will define new transcriptional regulators
controlling neuronal maturation, and 3) it will yield a new effective method for reprogramming immature stem
cell-derived motor neurons to a more mature state that will serve as a better model for adult-onset
neurodegenerative diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis."
10795029,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Infectious diseases have a substantial global health impact. Clinicians need rapid and accurate diagnoses of
infections to direct patient treatment and improve antibiotic stewardship, but current methodologies face severe
limitations in this regard. In the first funding cycle of our MPI grant “GM111066 - MS diagnostic bacterial
identification library,” we produced a novel diagnostic platform in which microbial membrane glycolipids
analyzed by mass spectrometry represent chemical “fingerprints” that were then used to differentiate Gram-
negative and –positive and fungal isolates after mono- or poly-microbial growth in standard laboratory medias
or complex biological (urine, blood bottles, and would effluent). In the second funding cycle, we aim to improve
the diagnostic as discussed below.
 At the start this project, it had not been previously shown that bacterial or fungal membrane lipids could
provide a unique chemical signature or barcode that could be used for reliable pathogen identification. The fact
that these lipids (Gram-: LPS/lipid A, Gram+: Lipoteichoic acid/cardiolipin, Fungi: glycerophospholipids,
sphingolipids, and sterols) are present in high abundance (~106 copies per cell) makes them easily extractable
with a single rapid LPS-based protocol (less than 60 minutes from sample to MS identification). Importantly, for
clinical use, we successfully used our platform to solve these four major unmet needs from the protein-based
phenotyping approach: 1) removed the need for growth prior to MS analysis, 2) identification of bacterial and
fungal isolates with a single extraction protocol, 3) identification directly from complex biological fluids,
including urine, BAL fluid, wound effluent, and blood bottles, and 4) antimicrobial resistant strains could be
distinguished from the related susceptible strain. Finally, based on our thirteen peer-reviewed publications from
the first funding period and extensive preliminary data, we believe we have proven our highly innovative
original hypothesis and even advanced it past the original aims by using a design of experiment (DOE) process
to allow identification in under an hour direct from specimen.
 In the second funding cycle, we propose to further innovate by i) using DOE to improve limit of detection
(LOD) from 106 to 103 which is the threshold for urinary tract infections; ii) extend the assay to direct analysis
of urine and stool samples without culture; iii) develop machine learning approaches to improve identification
of individual bacteria from polymicrobial infections; iv) expand detection of antimicrobial resistance beyond
colistin; v) develop a method for identification and structure analysis of lipids isolated from 100-1000 cells; and
vi) vastly expand our ability to identify pathogenic fungi, which are a growing healthcare issue, and Gram-
positive organisms."
10795032,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Coordination of Innate and Adaptive Immunity in Intestinal Barrier Defense. Intestinal barrier defense
requires the actions of both innate and adaptive immune cells on the mucosal epithelium. Tissue-resident and
mobile innate and adaptive immune cells each contribute to barrier defense in the intestines, but how these cell
populations are coordinated under conditions of pathogen threat are not fully understood. Interleukin-22 (IL-22)
is a cytokine of the IL-10 family produced by type 3 immune cells, such as group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s)
and cells of the Th17 pathway that acts on epithelial cells of barrier tissues to prevent invasion of extracellular
pathogens. How IL-22 acts to coordinate intestinal barrier function remains undefined. Like many immune
cytokines that participate in host defense, IL-22 is upregulated in chronic immune-mediated diseases, and it
appears to play a protective role in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), presumably by restraining epithelial
damage caused by dysregulated T cell responses to constituents of the intestinal microbiome. However, pro-
proliferative actions of IL-22 have also been implicated in malignant transformation of colonic epithelial cells that
leads to colorectal cancer (CRC). We and others have shown that during infectious colitis modeled by the
enteropathogen, C. rodentium, there are two phases of IL-22 production that can be distinguished: an early
phase dominated by IL-22+ innate immune cells, which is followed by a late phase dominated by IL-22+ T cells.
While both innate and adaptive immune cells produce IL-22 during infection, the respective contributions to
barrier protection are unknown, as are details of the mechanisms by which IL-22 acts. In preliminary studies that
have employed novel IL-22 reporter/conditional knockout (cKO) mice with which to track and/or delete specific
subsets of IL-22-producing immune cells, we have found that the locations and functions of IL-22–producing
cells are distinct during C. rodentium infection. Innate immune cells, dominated by ILC3s, are primarily located
in and restricted to isolated lymphoid follicles, and their release of IL-22 activated by IL-23 acts long-range to
activate surface colonic epithelial cells at initial sites of bacterial colonization. Remarkably, however, ILC3s fail
to protect the intestinal crypts, which are invaded by bacteria in mice with IL-22 deficiency targeted to T cells.
Thus, IL-22–producing T cells are indispensable for protection of the intestinal crypts via their activation of crypt-
lining epithelium. Moreover, we have discovered new heterogeneity within colonic absorptive enterocytes and
find that IL-22-producing T cells differentially activate these populations for increased shedding and production
of neutrophil-recruiting chemokines. In this proposal we will define mechanisms by which innate and adaptive
immune cells are specialized for distinct IL-22–dependent actions on different subsets of colonic epithelial cells,
focusing on novel functions of IL-22+ T cells to protect colonic crypts from bacterial invasion. These studies hold
promise to reveal new insights into specialization of immune cell subsets in intestinal host defense and
mechanisms that control intestinal inflammation in IBD and CRC."

Prenatal tobacco use among non-Hispanic Black people and sexual minorities is a pressing public health problem, placing these individuals and their infants at greater risk of poor health outcomes relative to other populations. Co-use of tobacco and cannabis during pregnancy is also more common in minoritized groups and may hinder prenatal smoking cessation and postpartum tobacco abstinence. Depressive symptoms represent a modifiable factor related to discrimination, prenatal tobacco, and prenatal cannabis use that can be addressed to promote perinatal cessation and prevent relapse. To achieve true health equity, effective perinatal tobacco and cannabis use cessation interventions created in partnership with vulnerable communities are necessary. Accordingly, the proposed project is designed to achieve the following aims: (1) Guided by a community collaborative, we propose to conduct formative research on the experiences of marginalized pregnant people who use cannabis and tobacco, to contextualize the role of depressive symptoms in prenatal dual use. We will co-create an interview guide; conduct interviews with 35 pregnant and parenting people who engage(d) in dual use and experienced prenatal depressive symptoms to determine the relationship among symptoms and tobacco and cannabis use, quit attempts, withdrawal, and relapse. We will code and evaluate themes from these interviews with the collaborative. (2) Guided by a community collaborative and using an intervention mapping approach, develop an intervention targeting prenatal depressive symptoms for prenatal tobacco and cannabis smoking cessation. (3) Guided by a community collaborative, conduct a single group, proof of concept feasibility trial of a new intervention designed to address prenatal depressive symptoms to encourage tobacco and cannabis cessation. Together, we will assess needs, choose behavioral targets and review the feasibility and acceptability of the novel intervention to prepare for future evaluation of efficacy. Although there are interventions addressing perinatal depressive symptoms, extant interventions may not be appropriate or effective for pregnant people from minoritized groups who use both cannabis and tobacco. Successful intervention development needs to include members of communities disproportionately affected by discrimination as a core part of the scientific process to better address prenatal smoking cessation. Thus, the project will provide data critical for a novel intervention to reduce prenatal co-use of tobacco and cannabis. The proposed study amplifies the voices of pregnant people from communities with higher rates of prenatal depressive symptoms and dual prenatal tobacco and cannabis use who have been under-represented in tobacco treatment research."

Black and Latinx people who use opioids (PWUO) bear a disproportionate burden of opioid-related overdose
deaths. Racial disparities among PWUO are exacerbated by persistent socioeconomic and structural barriers
(e.g., stigma, lack of social support, housing instability) which may be partially addressed using scalable open-
source solutions (e.g., peer recovery coaches, mobile health, telemedicine). With NIH support, we have
validated a theory-based, AI-driven texting using natural language processing in a publicly-funded health system
to provide real-time responses to patient queries combined with automated texts to enhance identification and
address participant unmet SDH needs (e.g., access to peer support, healthcare), and linkages and retention in
buprenorphine treatment per the medical management model (e.g., patient education, self-management). We
have also refined an evidence-supported Cultural Structural Humility (CSH) training for peer recovery coaches
(PRCs) that goes beyond a social determinants of health (SDH) framework to also include stigma reduction,
health habitus, and patient navigation to improve clinical outcomes and social services use among PWUO. This
proposal aims to adapt the evidence-supported CSH training to interactive video modules for peer recovery
coaches (PRCs), and refine an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven texting tool to reinforce core CSH principles. The
3-month pilot RCT will test AI-driven CSH-enhanced texting tool + CSH-trained PRC providing telephone-based
services coordination (multimodal intervention arm-1) vs. AI-driven CSH-enhanced texting tool (intervention
arm-2) vs. treatment as usual / informational pamphlets only (control arm) among emergency department-
enrolled Black / Latinx PWUO (N=150) to estimate rates of PRC-PWUO contact, AI-driven texting use among
PWUO, assess potential for pre-/post-intervention impact on reduction of felt and/or anticipated stigma, clinical
outcomes (i.e., time to initial receipt of buprenorphine), and social services use at 1- and 3-months to obtain
intervention effect sizes, and estimate the associated cost of implementing and sustaining the multimodal

multimodal intervention that has high public health impact on complementing the HHS Overdose Prevention
Strategy (i.e., harm reduction, OUD treatment, and recovery support) in a manner that is scalable, sustainable,
and equitable using open-source solutions. Our team is uniquely positioned to obtain data that will inform a
subsequent large-scale efficacy trial evaluating our proposed multimodal intervention to increase access to
buprenorphine and social services among Black / Latinx PWUO."

Pulmonary infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria are extremely difficult to treat. Gram-negative
`superbugs' are particularly worrisome in pulmonary infections and are often only susceptible to polymyxins.
However, intravenous polymyxins have poor efficacy for pulmonary infections due to limited drug exposure in
the airway. Inhaled polymyxins have been increasingly used in the clinic for the treatment of pulmonary infections;
yet current inhalation therapies are empirical and have never been optimized using
pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics/toxicodynamics approaches. No systematic evaluations have ever been
conducted on the pulmonary toxicity of inhaled polymyxins. Furthermore, the currently used traditional jet
nebulization has very low delivery efficiency (<15% of drug delivered to the lungs). Suboptimal use of inhaled
polymyxins has caused unsatisfactory therapeutic efficacy, emergence of resistance, frequent adverse effects,
and poor patient compliance. We have elucidated that polymyxin-induced pulmonary toxicity involves drug
accumulation in human alveolar epithelial cells, particularly in mitochondria, which leads to oxidative stress,
mitochondrial damage and apoptosis. Excitingly, we discovered that polymyxin combinations with
aminoglycosides can significantly attenuate polymyxin-induced pulmonary toxicity, maximize antimicrobial
activity and prevent resistance development. In this proposal, we will employ a multi-disciplinary approach to
develop efficient powder aerosol delivery systems for these promising polymyxin combinations. The overarching
hypothesis is that our optimized aerosol therapy of polymyxin combinations possesses superior delivery
efficiency and PK/PD/TD to treat pulmonary infections; prevents bacterial resistance by synergistically inhibiting
multiple key biochemical pathways; and minimizes toxicity in lung epithelial cells. The specific aims are: (1) To
elucidate the mechanisms of attenuation of polymyxin-induced pulmonary toxicity by aminoglycosides using
advanced imaging, CRISPR and transcriptomics; (2) To develop efficient aerosol delivery systems of polymyxin
combinations using innovative manufacturing techniques; (3) To examine the tripartite relationships among
human lung cells, Gram-negative pathogens, and superior polymyxin combinations using correlative multi-omics;
and (4) To optimize the dosage regimens of superior inhaled polymyxin combination formulations using a
machine learning-driven mechanism-based PK/PD/TD model. Our project responds in a timely manner to the
recent National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria (2020 – 2025)."
10930923,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT
Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are among the most important issues in public health today. Although e-
cigarettes have shown promise as a cessation aid for traditional cigarettes, the public health benefits of these
products may be undermined by the soaring rates of initiation among previously nicotine-naïve youth and the
propensity for these products to foster nicotine dependence. There are a growing number of people who report
wanting to quit using e-cigarettes and not being able to do so successfully, underscoring the need for research
to determine factors that impede e-cigarette cessation. When smokers abstain abruptly from combustible
cigarette use, a withdrawal syndrome emerges that includes core symptoms of negative affect and craving,
impaired cognitive functioning, and disturbed sleep, all of which ultimately hinder cessation attempts. However,
there is very limited controlled research on e-cigarette withdrawal, and it is unknown the extent to which nicotine
contributes to any emergent e-cigarette withdrawal syndrome. This project will use a rigorous residential
laboratory design to evaluate e-cigarette withdrawal expression and experimentally determine the role of nicotine
in this syndrome. Healthy adults who exclusively use e-cigarettes (N=120) will undergo monitored e-cigarette
abstinence over seven days (1 week) in a residential unit. We will evaluate the contribution of nicotine to
withdrawal expression by assigning participants to one of three conditions: active nicotine patch, placebo patch
control, or no patch to control for expectancies. Standardized behavioral and biological measures associated
with withdrawal including patient report, cognitive task performance, and biometrics will be collected throughout
to establish a rigorous timecourse of withdrawal and evaluate the contribution of nicotine to these symptoms.
Three Specific Aims are designed to test core features of nicotine withdrawal mirroring three core areas of
nicotine/tobacco withdrawal described in the DSM-5. Specific Aims will evaluate the timecourse and contribution
of nicotine to withdrawal-induced changes in subjective mood (Specific Aim 1), cognitive performance (Specific
Aim 2), and sleep disturbance (Specific Aim 3). An Exploratory Aim will evaluate the impact of withdrawal on
motivation and return to use. We hypothesize negative affect and craving will increase, cognitive performance
will decrease, and sleep will be impaired during the residential abstinence period. We also hypothesize that
withdrawal symptoms will be attenuated with nicotine patch relative to both control conditions. This research will
use a rigorously-controlled residential study to provide vital information about the clinical significance of
behavioral and biological e-cigarette withdrawal symptoms and demonstrate the role of nicotine in the expression
of withdrawal to inform the viability of translating established and readily accessible nicotine replacement
interventions to e-cigarette cessation."

School readiness skills prior to entering elementary school are crucial for later academic success and,
importantly, these skills may act as a protective factor for low-income students as they transition into
Kindergarten and continue through elementary school. However, extant studies of school readiness before
elementary school have largely defined and measured this construct in narrow and potentially inaccurate ways.
For the most part, studies have focused on cognitive assessments, ignoring important social-emotional
characteristics that are required to perform well in the classroom. For studies that have taken these factors into
account, this is often assessed by parent or teacher report or in the home or lab settings, which ignore the way
in which the demands of the classroom environment may affect functioning. In addition, these assessments are
primarily behavioral; very few studies have attempted to understand the interplay of children’s
psychophysiological functioning and their classroom experiences. Indeed, there is a substantial gap in our
knowledge regarding how psychophysiological functioning may impact students’ school readiness and early
school success; this is particularly salient if we seek to improve academic outcomes for low-income children
through early education.
To address this gap, a diverse sample of families will be recruited for the proposed short-term longitudinal
study. We will enroll 270 children from approximately 30 classrooms prior to their final year of preschool (preK).
Across preK, children will participate in several data collection visits including fall and spring school readiness
assessments. In addition, on two occasions across the school year, we will observe children in the classroom
while also collecting cardiac data. Finally, at the end of Kindergarten, several assessments of school success
will be conducted. These data will be used to examine how teacher behavior and children’s respiratory sinus
arrhythmia (RSA), a key indicator of psychophysiological regulation and function, work together to predict
school readiness and early school success.
This study will be the first to examine school readiness in a sample of low-income children that includes
conducting naturalistic observations (and cardiac monitoring) of children and their teachers in the preK
classroom at two timepoints, with a focus on the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) as a mechanism that
may play a critical role the way in which children respond differently to teacher sensitivity and behavior, and
subsequently predict school readiness and school success in Kindergarten."

Children diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) continue to have an overall poor outcome with rates
of relapse that approach 40%. Relapsed disease is particularly resistant to conventional therapy.
Unfortunately, the molecular alterations that are common in relapsed pediatric AML have been poorly defined.
Recently our group reported on the spectrum of genetic changes in 136 children with relapsed AML and
identified tandem duplications of exon 13 of UBTF (upstream binding transcription factor) in nearly 10% of
children with relapsed AML. We further demonstrated that UBTF-tandem duplication (UBTF-TD) AMLs are
also present in 4% of children at diagnosis, yet are rare in adults, and commonly occur with FLT3-ITD and
WT1 mutations along with either normal karyotype cytogenetics or trisomy 8. Importantly, we demonstrated
that children with UBTF-TD AML have an inferior overall survival and high rates of minimal residual disease
after induction chemotherapy. Our preliminary functional studies have confirmed that UBTF-TD expression
is sufficient to drive proliferation and self-renewal of primary human hematopoietic cells and that UBTF-TD
proteins maintain canonical interactions of wild-type UBTF, but also interact with new proteins/networks
important in leukemia development, such as KMT2A and XPO1. Collectively these genomic, functional and
clinical findings suggest that UBTF-TD AMLs represents a new molecular category of pediatric AML and
establishes a strong scientific premise to investigate the molecular impact of UBTF tandem duplications in
primary hematopoietic cells. We hypothesize that UBTF-TD represents in new initiating lesion that drives the
expression of specific transcriptional networks, in particular the HOXB program, through new interactions with
the genome and from collaboration with unique cooperating mutations and interacting proteins. We will test
our hypothesis with the following specific aims using a combination of genetic tools in human and mouse
hematopoietic cells. Specific Aim 1: Decipher the molecular mechanisms of UBTF-TD in leukemogenesis;
Specific Aim 2: Dissect the contribution of UBTF-TD and co-occurring mutations to leukemogenesis using in
vivo models; Specific Aim 3. Establish the contribution of UBTF domains and interacting proteins to UBTF-
TD mediated transformation. Not only will the proposed studies elucidate the transcriptional and epigenetic
impact of UBTF-TD expression in primary hematopoietic cells, including patient samples, but they will also
establish multiple mouse and human model systems for this new subtype of high-risk pediatric AML and
evaluate potential vulnerabilities. The successful completion of these proposed studies, and the resulting
model systems, will ultimately be used to develop therapeutic approaches to target UBTF-TD AMLs and most
importantly to improve the long-term outcome of children with these leukemias."
10801155,"Project summary/Abstract
Addiction remains a vast problem in the United States and complicating the issue is the lack of FDA-approved
medications for the treatment of cocaine use disorder (CUD) making it a critical unmet need. A difficulty in
identifying treatment options is that CUD is multi-faceted involving interactions among several external factors,
including stress, which is unavoidable in daily life. Despite the prevalence of stress in human populations of
CUD, most pre-clinical addiction research does not incorporate stress as a factor during periods of drug use.
To examine the importance of stress-cocaine interactions on cocaine use and seeking behavior we use a
model where, in rats demonstrating otherwise stable cocaine self-administration (SA), a stressor delivered
daily at the time of cocaine SA, escalates cocaine intake and enhances cocaine-seeking behavior. This likely
involves neurobiological mediators that connect stress-responsive and reward systems in the brain, such as
endocannabinoid signaling (eCB). In support of this, systemic administration of a cannabinoid receptor 1
antagonist attenuates cocaine-induced reinstatement only in rats with a history of stress. Furthermore, we have
localized this effect to the prelimbic cortex (PrL), a key site for regulation of stress and drug-seeking behavior.
Importantly, eCB signaling, through attenuation of inhibitory neurotransmission, is well positioned to regulate
PrL pyramidal neuron activity and output which ultimately results in expression of enhanced cocaine-seeking
behavior. This proposal tests the novel hypothesis that repeated stress at the time of cocaine SA produces
long-lasting upregulation of eCB signaling in the PrL leading to increased pyramidal neuron activity and drug-
seeking behavior through dysregulated GABAergic signaling. To test this hypothesis, we will use behavioral,
molecular, and neurophysiological techniques to assess the involvement of PrL eCB signaling in the long-term
consequences of repeated stress-cocaine interactions. First, we will assess the role of PrL eCB signaling, via
pharmacological manipulation, in enhanced cocaine-induced reinstatement in stress-escalated rats. We will
then identify how combined repeated stress and cocaine SA regulates PrL eCB signaling by quantifying cell
type-specific changes in molecular components of the eCB system using fluorescent in situ hybridization, and
measure changes in PrL eCB content with mass spectrometry following cocaine-induced reinstatement. Lastly,
we will examine changes in eCB-mediated inhibitory synaptic plasticity that are associated with enhanced
cocaine-induced reinstatement, using whole-cell patch clamp recordings in the PrL. We will also use in vivo
fiber photometry measurement of Ca2+signaling to identify the contribution of eCB signaling to changes in PrL
pyramidal neuron activity associated with enhanced cocaine-induced reinstatement. These studies will provide
much needed information about how stress-drug interactions regulate prefrontal cortical circuits and has
treatment implications for those with CUD, especially for those for whom stress is a predominant contributing
factor by identifying unique neurobiological mechanisms that may provide therapeutic targets."

 Pyruvate is a metabolite that sits at the intersection of key metabolic pathways; it is the end product of
glycolysis, the starting point for gluconeogenesis, and ultimately it is destined for transport into mitochondria as
a master fuel that drives ATP production by oxidative phosphorylation. Altered pyruvate metabolism plays an
especially prominent role in biology of metabolically challenged diseases such as cancer. Metabolic alterations
in cancer are numerous, including aerobic glycolysis, reduced oxidative phosphorylation and the increased gen-
eration of biosynthetic intermediates needed for cell growth and proliferation. MRI is based on the detection of
nuclear spin magnetization, which is a product of spin density and the degree of spin alignment (i.e., polarization).
Conventional MRI detects signals arising from the very small “thermal"" proton spin polarization, typically of order
10–5 at clinical scanner field strengths (1.5 – 7T). This low spin polarization limits the sensitivity of MRI to detect
molecules at low concentration. Hyperpolarization techniques can be used to increase nuclear spin polarization
by several orders of magnitude – up to the order of unity – with corresponding gains in the detection sensitivity
threshold. Recent advances in hyperpolarized (HP) MRI, pioneered by our team and others, allow in vivo tracking
of metabolic transformations of injected HP 13C-pyruvate to multiple downstream metabolites, resulting in multi-
ple new imaging biomarkers that can flag altered metabolism in diseases such as cancer and heart disease,
inform disease progression, and guide treatment decisions. For example, HP 13C-pyruvate MRI has shown met-
abolic reprogramming in response to cancer treatment within only a few days in glioma, glioblastoma multiforme,
gastric cancer, and breast cancer animal studies. While HP 13C-pyruvate MRI has become a highly acclaimed
way to assess pyruvate metabolism in vivo and rival the efficacy of Positron Emission Tomography, only a hand-
ful research sites have been conducting early-phase clinical trials of HP 13C-pyruvate MRI since its first-in-human
debut in 2010. Major hurdles include the need for a hyperpolarizer, a HP 13C-pyruvate production workflow, and
the need for MRI scanners with multinuclear 13C imaging capability. To overcome a key operational barrier for
the hyperpolarized MRI community, we propose here a radical rethinking of the requirement for multinuclear
hardware on clinical scanners. Our goal is to develop hyperpolarized MRI into a clinically viable technique for
the evaluation of aberrant metabolism in disease states using clinical MRI scanners that have only proton imag-
ing capabilities. To this end, we will develop and build a smart cost-effective add-on module which, when used
in conjunction with a polarizer for HP 13C-pyruvate production, will transfer polarization from 13C to proton and
enable in vivo imaging of pyruvate metabolism on standard clinical scanner using the already available and
optimized proton RF coils and imaging sequences on the scanners. If successful, the functioning prototype will
be ready for evaluation in animals and directly translatable to the clinical imaging of metabolic processes."
10801307,"Hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HypoPP) is a dominantly inherited disorder of skeletal muscle in which recurrent
attacks of weakness are caused by intermittent failure of fiber excitability. Episodes occur in association with
hypokalemia (K+ < 3 mM) and are often triggered by carbohydrate ingestion, exercise, or stress. The molecular
defect in HypoPP is heterogeneous, with 60% of families having missense mutations in CACNA1S encoding the
L-type Ca channel CaV1.1, and 20% have missense mutations in SCN4A encoding the voltage-gated Na+
channel NaV1.4. Management of symptoms is limited to avoiding trigger factors, optimizing serum K+ levels, or
empirical use of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors that have modest response rates (~50%) and adverse side effects.
An even greater concern, with no existing therapeutic intervention, is the slowly progressive permanent muscle
weakness (PMW) that impairs mobility and may cause loss of ambulation.
All 14 HypoPP mutations in NaV1.4 and 10 of 11 in CaV1.1 occur at arginine residues in S4 transmembrane
segments of voltage-sensor domains (VSD). We have been the leading group to show this consistent motif gives
rise to a shared functional defect in HypoPP mutant channels: the anomalous gating pore leakage current.
Moreover, simulations with our computational model show that this small anomalous conductance in CaV1.1 or
in NaV1.4 (about 1% of the total resting fiber conductance) is sufficient to cause paradoxical depolarization of
and associated inactivation of sodium channels, with subsequent loss of fiber excitability and weakness.
Based on these insights on the pathogenesis of episodic HypoPP, we now propose new pharmacological and
gene editing approaches for improved clinical management of HypoPP that will be tested and optimized in our
knockin mutant CaV1.1-R528H mouse model of HypoPP. In Aim 1, our pharmacological approaches are directed
at two separate targets: (i) block the gating pore and (ii) stabilizing by activation of KV7 K+ channels.
Preliminary data show that HIFs (developed by our collaborator, F. Tombola, to block Hv1 voltage-gated proton
channels) attenuate the low-K+ induced loss of force for CaV1.1-R528H muscle and block an inward current,
consistent with block of the HypoPP gating pore leak. Other data show that retigabine, a KV7 opener, can prevent
the low-K+ induced loss of force and hasten the recovery from weakness in R528H muscle. In Aim 2, two gene
editing technologies will be used to develop a more durable improvement in symptom management that also
has the potential to attenuate or prevent the late-onset PMW. The first approach is disruption of the mutant allele
with CRISPR/Cas9. The rationale is that HypoPP is a dominant trait caused by a gain-of-function defect (gating
pore current) and that one normal CACNA1S allele appears to be sufficient for normal muscle function in mice
and humans. Our preliminary data show allele-specific disruption of R528H in vivo, with complete suppression
of the HypoPP phenotype. The second approach uses base editors to correct the mutation (without the risk of
off-target double-strand breaks) and preserve both alleles."

 We have identified a novel mode of autonomous programmed cell death that is controlled by p53 in
small cell lung cancer (SCLC) — the most deadly form of lung cancer. We capitalized on a genetically
engineered mouse model that we created to regulate endogenous p53 inactivation and its temporally
controlled reactivation in established mouse models of SCLC. We found that p53 controls a canonical
senescence program in approximately half of the tumors and a non-apoptotic cell death program in the rest.
The mechanism of cell death is distinct from known forms of programmed cell death but is dependent on
multiple members of the cyclophilin protein family of peptydyl-prolyl isomerases. We demonstrate that p53
regulates a distinct transcriptional program in dying SCLC tumors not active in senescing SCLC. Moreover, the
activation of this transcriptional program is abolished by small molecule inhibitors of cyclophilins. In aim 1 of
our project, we will interrogate the molecular underpinnings of this p53-cyclophilin interaction. At the cell
physiological level, p53-mediated SCLC cell death is associated with features of paraptosis; a poorly defined
mode of cell death not previously associated with p53 but characterized by excessive accumulation of
cytoplasmic vacuoles, cell swelling, and plasma membrane dysfunction. Additionally, we observed massive
induction of an endoplasmic reticulum-directed autophagy program (ER-phagy) during p53-mediated SCLC
death. In aim 2 of our project we will interrogate the molecular features and dissect the molecular determinants
of paraptosis and ER-phagy in this context. Finally, we present comparative genomics that implicates that the
`classical' molecular subtype of SCLC is represented by SCLC tumors that die after p53 restoration and that
the `variant' molecular subtype of SCLC is represented by SCLC tumors that senesce after p53 restoration. In
aim 3 of our project, we will determine if the effects of p53 restoration are distinct based on either the cell of
origin, or the collection of driver mutations as each of these impacts the molecular subtype that develops in
SCLC. Together, our project will elucidate an important molecular mechanism for controlling SCLC, shed light
on targetable vulnerabilities, and identify specific subsets of SCLC patients that may be susceptible to such
approaches."
10801397,"Overweight and obesity are public health problems and contribute to numerous chronic diseases. Most
Behavioral Weight Loss Interventions (BWI) have typically included aerobic forms of exercise (e.g., brisk walking)
and have shown that this form of physical activity enhances weight loss compared to dietary approaches alone.
Given the potential benefits of yoga, there are claims that these benefits can contribute to yoga being effective
for weight loss. However, there are few long-term rigorous studies of yoga to support that yoga can enhance
weight loss, or other health outcomes, beyond what is achieved with other forms of physical activity within the
context of a BWI for adults with overweigh or obesity. The 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee
found that there was insufficient evidence available to determine the relationship between yoga on indicators of
health risk progression, which included body mass index (BMI). Therefore, the Physical Activity Guidelines
Advisory Committee recommended the need to conduct systematic and coordinated randomized trials on the
health effects of yoga, and we will be focused on obesity in this application.
 We propose a study of high scientific rigor using a randomized clinical trial design in this current application.
This study will build on our preliminary work and will conduct a 12-month randomized clinical trial. We will
implement a BWI and randomize participants to one of two physical activity prescriptions: 1) aerobic physical
activity (BWI+AER), 2) aerobic + yoga physical activity (BWI+AER+YOGA). The BWI includes contemporary
evidence-based behavioral strategies and a proven energy-reduced diet. The primary outcome will be weight
loss. Additional outcomes will include physical activity (moderate-to-vigorous intensity, light-intensity,
engagement in yoga), body composition, cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular strength, resting blood pressure,
process measures of diet and eating behavior. We also will assess the acute and chronic effects on measures
that may be particularly responsive to yoga that may also influence weight loss. These include perceived stress
and distress, affect/mood, depressive symptoms, sleep, and hunger/satiety. We will examine moderators (e.g.,
sex, race/ethnicity, etc.) of the effectiveness of our interventions on weight change and other outcomes.
 This study is important to patients with overweight and obesity, and clinicians who treat these patients. This
will provide clarity on the contribution of yoga to weight loss and other health outcomes in patients with obesity,
which is based on rigorous science within the context of a randomized trial."

The human placenta plays a major role in maintaining the proper environment for fetal growth, but remains a
poorly-understood organ, particular during early gestation. Over the past few years, advances in single cell
analysis and stem cell derivation have finally been applied to this organ, resulting in significant expansion, both
of knowledge of cellular heterogeneity as well as of cell-based modeling, of trophoblast, the epithelial cells of
the placenta. Specifically, multiple groups have established protocols for derivation of trophoblast stem cells
(TSC) and trophoblast organoids from early gestation human placenta, which allow for study of differentiation
into functional syncytiotrophoblast (STB) and extravillous trophoblast (EVT). Other groups, including our own,
have established reproducible protocols for conversion of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC) into bona fide
TSC, allowing for modeling of both normal and abnormal trophoblast differentiation. However, recent data
suggest that primary TSC have a more limited differentiation potential than originally described, with a profile
that is most consistent with precursors to EVT, rather than a truly bipotential “TSC.” In fact, while human
trophectoderm (TE) cells and early gestation villous CTB (vCTB) co-express TP63 and CDX2, primary TSC
lack CDX2, and hPSC-derived TSC lose CDX2 during the transition from TE to TSC. In addition, placentas
from Trisomy 21 (T21)-affected pregnancies show a persistent vCTB layer, with a significant proportion
retaining CDX2 expression beyond first trimester; this is accompanied by an abnormality of T21-CTB to form
STB in vitro, a phenotype which we have recapitulated using T21-affected hPSC. We hypothesize that CDX2+
vCTB represents a distinct trophoblast progenitor state, one that is possibly more primitive, and/or has altered
differentiation potential. The goal of this application is to identify the role of CDX2 in establishment of TE,
maintenance of a trophoblast progenitor state, and TSC differentiation potential, and characterize the
cellular defects associated with its abnormal persistence in T21-affected placentae and the
accompanying placental dysfunction. To this end, we propose to use a combination of CTB, TSC, and
trophoblast organoids, derived directly from normal and T21-affected placentas or pluripotent stem cells, along
with state-of-the-art single cell/single nucleus transcriptome profiling and complementary functional assays to
address these goals. Successful completion of this proposal will provide a comprehensive molecular
and functional assessment of cytotrophoblast heterogeneity in early gestation placenta, identify
capacities and limitations of different in vitro human trophoblast model systems, and offer insights
into mechanisms of placental dysfunction in pregnancies affected by Trisomy 21."

The objective of this study is to identify how a trauma-focused psychotherapy for PTSD, cognitive processing
therapy (CPT), alters the function and information processing of the brain during reward learning. Preliminary
data indicate abnormal function of the brain’s reward circuit (ventromedial prefrontal cortex, ventral striatum)
during reward learning in PTSD. Changes in this circuitry may serve as one mechanism of therapeutic
improvement in diminished positive affect symptoms. This is an important area of study, as PTSD diminished
positive affect symptoms (e.g., difficulty experiencing positive emotions, diminished interest) are poorly
understood neurobiologically and consistently associated with poorer quality of life and worse clinical outcomes.
We will assess neural circuitry function and neural encoding (representation in brain signal) of reward-related
information parameters with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Parameters will be derived from
reinforcement learning (RL) computational models of reward task behavior before and after CPT treatment.
Preliminary data indicate CPT alters the function and neural encoding of RL information parameters in PTSD,
and that changes vary by whether imminent threat is embedded in the reward processing context. This is an
ecologically valid approach to studying this construct, as: a) PTSD is characterized by hypervigilance for threat;
b) individuals with PTSD often perceive threat in the absence of explicit threat; and c) trauma-focused
psychotherapies utilize techniques that may impact both threat and reward-based processes. The rationale is
that improved understanding of therapeutic mechanisms may lead to identification of novel treatment targets,
which can be utilized to improve treatment outcomes. The central hypothesis is that CPT will alter neural
encoding of RL parameters during reward learning variably as a function of threat context. We will recruit 120
individuals with chronic PTSD. Individuals will undergo clinical and fMRI assessment to measure brain function
during reward learning with a contextual threat manipulation. RL computational models will facilitate examination
of neural encoding under contexts where threat is present or absent. Participants will then be randomized
(stratified on presence of comorbid major depressive disorder to ensure equal representation across arms) to
receive either immediate, individual CPT treatment or to a delayed treatment condition (N=60 each). Individuals
will then repeat clinical and fMRI assessments, and those in delayed treatment will then commence with CPT
treatment. It is predicted that CPT will: a) in the absence of threat, enhance neural RL encoding in the ventral
striatum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex and decrease neural encoding in the amygdala; and b) under threat
(of shock), promote a reduction in ventral striatal/ventromedial prefrontal RL neural encoding and an adaptive,
treatment-facilitated increase in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex RL encoding. Outcomes will enhance
understanding of trauma-focused psychotherapy mechanisms and may provide novel future treatment targets."

Cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) represents an important clinical issue affecting up to 75% of people
before, during, and after diagnosis and treatment. Understanding cognitive trajectories associated with cancer
and cancer treatment is particularly important among older adults (age ≥ 65) who may be more susceptible to
CRCI. However, older adults have been underrepresented and previous studies have been limited by a
predominance of short-term follow-up, focus on breast cancer, and a lack of mechanistic investigation. The
overall objective of this application is to determine risk, susceptibility, and biological mechanisms linking cancer,
cancer treatment and cognitive functioning. We will leverage data from ASPREE (Aspirin in Reducing Events in
the Elderly) and its observational follow-up study (ASPREE-XT). ASPREE was a trial of 19,114 individuals aged
≥70 years (≥ 65 for US minorities) enrolled in Australia (n=16,703) or the United States (n=2,411) in which
participants were randomly allocated to daily low-dose (100 mg) aspirin or placebo. At enrollment, participants
had no history of diagnosed dementia, cardiovascular disease, significant physical disability, or major cognitive
impairment. Repeated measures of multiple domains of cognitive function were performed, including memory,
executive function, and psychomotor speed, assessed at baseline and every 2 years (2010-2017), and then
annually during follow-up (2018-2024). We will use a prospective longitudinal study design to examine the
following specific aims: Aim 1. Determine the impact of cancer and cancer treatment on longitudinal trajectories
of cognitive functioning. We will expand the cancer treatment data set to include treatment data for all cancer
events through to 2024, and further investigate whether host factors such as age at diagnosis, assignment to
aspirin or placebo, educational attainment, APOE risk genotype, dementia polygenic risk score, pre-diagnostic
clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminant significance (CHIP), or biomarkers associated with Alzheimer’s Disease
and related dementias (ADRD) neuropathology (Aβ, p-tau, NfL, and GFAP) impact risk. Aim 2. Determine the
impact of cancer and cancer treatment on CHIP and ADRD biomarkers (Aβ, p-tau, NfL, and GFAP) and
investigate potential mediating effects with respect to cognitive functioning. This study is significant because it
addresses the high unmet need to elucidate the relationship between cancer and cancer treatment and cognitive
functioning in older adults, to characterize pre-diagnostic factors that confer susceptibility, and identify
mechanisms that underlie associations. In so doing, it enables early detection of high-risk individuals. It directly
addresses the priorities outlined in NOT-CA-21-031. This study leverages a unique study population with
longitudinal measures of cognitive function before and after cancer diagnosis, investigates cognitive trajectories,
includes multiple cancer types, focuses on older adults, and advances mechanistic understanding of cancer-
related cognitive impairment. The impact will be to help identify individuals at higher risk CRCI and the modifiable
targets for intervention, ultimately improving quality of life and independent living."

Pericytes are vascular mural cells embedded in the basement membrane and extending their processes along
the walls of blood microvessels; they play key roles in vascular development and the maintenance of
microvascular functions. In the last decade, our knowledge about pericytes and their functions in CNS diseases
has grown tremendously, and brain pericytes are increasingly accepted as a guardian of mammalian blood-brain
barrier, as well as an important player in neurological disorders and neurodegenerative diseases, such as
Alzheimer’s disease. However, the lack of specific marker or genetic tools for brain pericytes has become a
major hurdle to key questions such as brain pericyte’s heterogeneity, specialization during embryonic
development and plasticity in aging and diseases. Many genetic models have been developed in the past based
on classic genetic markers such as Pdgfrb, Cspg4 and Rgs5, but none of them are truly specific to brain pericytes.
To address this gap in brain pericyte specific tools, we compiled 8 transcriptomic datasets and identified that
Atp13a5 is perhaps a better marker for brain pericytes in mice. After generating a transgenic reporter and CreER
model, we confirmed that Atp13a5 is specific to brain pericytes, as the reporter is not expressed in peripheral
organs. Surprisingly, we also found that in the brain, Atp13a5 reporter only marks BBB-pericytes, as it is not
found in the brain regions that are outside of the BBB, including the pineal gland, pituitary gland and choroid
plexus, which are also known as the circumventricular organs. Therefore, based on this new Atp13a5 marker,
we are now able to clearly separate BBB pericytes from the non-BBB pericytes.
The finding of Atp13a5-based brain pericyte heterogeneity now allows us to define and study BBB pericytes
more accurately in aging and disease conditions, as well as probe the fundamental difference between BBB
pericytes with non-BBB ones at anatomical and histological levels. Since pericyte degeneration, injury and loss
are commonly found in age-related neurodegenerative disorders, here we propose to anatomically map
pericyte’s heterogeneity in brain, and further determine the heterogeneity throughout aging and AD (Aim 1). In
addition, we also found Atp13a5-expressing BBB pericytes are highly vulnerable to hypoxic condition and
amyloid toxicity, and plan to conduct CRISPR genome-wide screenings to discover new molecular regulators
that can potentially overriding the pericyte loss in aging and AD (Aim 2). We hope that the new marker and tools
will help us to achieve a better understanding of brain pericyte biology and heterogeneity in the context of BBB
functions, as well as their contributions to CNS disorders. The data to be gathered from this study will open a
door to a new level of research to understand pericyte biology, functions, diversity, and contributions to aging
and related CNS diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, as well as provide new insights for potential applications
of gene therapy targeting brain pericytes in CNS disorders."

The purpose of this proposal is to develop two strategies, natural language processing (NLP) and automated
speech analysis (ASA), to enable automated identification of patients with cognitive impairment (CI), from mild
cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementias (ADRD) in clinical settings. The number
of older adults in the United States with MCI and ADRD is increasing and yet the ability of clinicians and
researchers to identify them at scale has advanced little over recent decades and screening with clinical
assessments is done inconsistently. Alternative strategies using available data, like analysis of diagnostic
codes in the clinical record or insurance claims, have very low sensitivity. NLP and ASA used with machine
learning are technologies that could greatly increase ability to detect MCI and ADRD in clinical contexts. NLP
automatically converts text in the electronic health record (EHR) into structured concepts suitable for analysis.
Thus, clinicians’ documentation of signs and symptoms or orders of tests and services that reflect or address
cognitive limitations can be efficiently captured, possibly long before the clinician uses an ADRD-related
diagnostic code. ASA directly measures cognition by recognizing different features of cognition captured in
speech. Extracting features through both NLP and ASA could thus provide a unique measure of cognition and
its impact on the individual and their caregivers.
Early detection of MCI and ADRD can help researchers identify appropriate patients for research and help
clinicians and health systems target patients for preventive care and care coordination. For these reasons,
more efficient, highly scalable strategies are needed to identify people with MCI and ADRD. The Specific Aims
of this proposal are to (1) Develop and validate a ML algorithm using features extracted from the EHR with
NLP to identify patients with CI, (2) Develop and validate a ML algorithm using features extracted from ASA of
audio recordings of patient-provider encounters during routine primary care visits to identify patients with CI,
(3) Develop and validate a ML algorithm using both NLP and ASA extracted features to create an integrated CI
diagnostic algorithm. We will develop machine learning algorithms using NLP and ASA extracted features
trained against neurocognitive assessment data on 800 primary care patients in New York City and validate
them in an independent sample of 200 patients in Chicago. In secondary analyses we will train ML algorithms
to identify MCI and its subtypes. This project will be the most rigorous development of NLP, ASA, and ML
algorithms for CI yet performed, the first to test ASA in primary care settings, and the first to test NLP and ASA
feature extraction strategies in combination. The multi-disciplinary team of clinicians, health services
researchers, and neurocognitive and data scientists will apply machine learning to develop these highly
scalable, automated technologies for identification of MCI and ADRD.

This application requests renewal of a progressive and tiered training program that equips researchers and
research teams with the skills to advance the occupational and environmental health research and translational
agenda in the linked U01 application (1/2: GEOHealth Hub for Research and Training in Eastern Africa –
Ethiopia). The trainees will be equipped to become regional research and training leaders and knowledgeable
in guiding policy. Building on successes and lessons from the current program, the proposed training and
research will advance translation of locally relevant scientific evidence around pressing issues in environmental
and occupational health, including climate change, into impactful actions. The training program will be
implemented in collaboration with Addis Ababa University (AAU) in Ethiopia, the Hub institution for the linked
application; the Spoke institutions are in Kenya (University of Nairobi) and Uganda (Makerere University).
Additional training partners will be in Rwanda, Ghana, and Cameroon further expanding the Hub's reach beyond
Eastern Africa, and longer-term plans will move toward more targeted expansion across sub-Saharan Africa.
The training program will build the competencies needed to address critical research themes emerging from
comprehensive Situational Analysis and Needs Assessments for these low- and middle-income countries: indoor
and outdoor air pollution, with a focus on children's and women's health; occupational health, specifically heat
exposure and worker productivity; and climate change. The U2R team includes experienced researchers and
educators from Columbia University, Colorado School of Public Health, Colorado State University, and the
University of Southern California who have records of collaboration with AAU and other partner institutions.
Tiered training activities will promote enhanced research capacity—creating national scientific leaders who can
advance research that addresses issues in occupational and environmental health—and skills in policy
translation, for national and regional contexts. In line with these goals and to ensure sustainability, the Hub and
Spoke institutions will assume leadership for locally developed training. The Hub Scholar program will continue
to use a flexible, cost-effective array of training modalities, including limited-length stays at Columbia University
and other US partner institutions; in-country MS- and PhD-level training with co-advising by US-based and
Eastern African mentors; in-country workshops and short courses; and synchronous and asynchronous distance-
based approaches. We also will continue to use innovative approaches to facilitate policy translation through
real-world engagement with stakeholders. Evaluation will track participants' success in meeting their
development goals in the short term and, in the longer term, in completing the proposed research, contributing
scientific presentations and papers, and attaining grant funding. Through careful case studies, we will continue
to examine the impact of trainees on policy indicators, such as implementation of new national air quality
standards and guidelines, regulations, and changes in practices."
10807965,"The mission of the NRG Oncology Statistics and Data Management Center (SDMC) is to provide all
necessary expertise and personnel for the design, conduct and analysis of clinical trials and associated
research for NRG Oncology, a member group of the NCI National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN)
program. The 2019-2024 cycle represents the second period of the NCTN program, which succeeded
the NCI Cancer Cooperative Group program and of which NRG Oncology was formed by the unification
of three of the Cooperative Groups. NRG Oncology has unique expertise in gender-specific malignancies
(breast, gynecologic, and prostate cancer), as well as a major presence in several cancer types (head &
neck, lung, brain, upper GI) where radiotherapy has a critical role in conjunction with other modalities. In
the first cycle (2014-2019) of the NCTN, the NRG Oncology SDMC and partner Operations Center
personnel expended significant effort in successfully transforming into a truly united and highly
functioning group. Success in this effort for the SDMC is evident throughout the renewal application. At
the same time, the new group made significant strides in advancing cancer treatment, ancillary care, and
biologic knowledge, which is also thoroughly in evidence through the clinical/scientific output of NRG
Oncology, and through contributions of the SDMC to clinical trials methodology and practice. During the
first cycle, the group initiated 32 new trials and obtained final approval on an additional 14 trials that are
now in development, while maintaining accrual and/or follow-up to primary and secondary endpoint
reporting on over 80 additional trials that were active at the inception of NRG Oncology. Publications
from the group to date number over 300, including 39 methodology articles by SDMC statisticians.
 In the second NCTN period, NRG Oncology anticipates even greater success, and the SDMC is
critical to achieving this goal. To carry out its mission, the NRG Oncology SDMC will continue to
collaborate closely with NRG Oncology leadership and trial investigators to design and conduct highest
quality clinical trials that will yield definitive conclusions. The SDMC will provide continuous trial conduct
oversight through all stages from concept inception through protocol development, trial monitoring, initial
reporting, and publication. Through its quality assurance program, the SDMC will provide quality control
checks across the lifecycle of trials. The SDMC will continue to apply, or develop as needed, innovative
statistical designs in all phases of clinical trials, using integrated developmental phases of trials where
advantageous, and incorporating modern biomarker based information into trial designs and their
attendant analysis plans. The SDMC will continue to Implement state-of-the-art data management and
information technology systems to assure secure high-quality data collection, maintenance, and curation
for additional discovery and data sharing with the larger research community."
10804928,"Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is highly co-morbid with chronic pain conditions. Pain contributes to
more severe PTSD (and vice versa) as evidenced by greater disability, more frequent use of harmful opioid
analgesics and increased pain severity. Biomechanisms underlying the entanglement of pain and trauma in
Veterans are incompletely understood. This is a renewal application (CSR&D Merit Review CX000816) to
continue deciphering the neural networks underlying pain and PTSD co-morbidity in Veterans. The long-term
goal is to determine biological markers of heterogeneity within pain-trauma co-morbidity in order to improve
symptom prevention and treatments. Understanding unique and overlapping impact of pain and/or trauma
symptoms on the underlying neurocircuitry has the potential to optimize existing and pave way to developing
new, biologically targeted interventions. The objective of this renewal is to build upon our prior findings and
identify the role of expectation in pain-trauma comorbidity in diagnostically heterogeneous Veterans with
combat trauma and chronic pain. Our current hypotheses are based on our published and strong preliminary
data. We propose to test the “two-component” expectation or anticipation model whereby neural systems
underlying anticipation of pain onset (broken in traumatic stress) and pain offset (broken in chronic pain)
interact to create biomechanistic vulnerability for pain-trauma comorbidity. We will examine the integrity (i.e.,
connectivity) and capability (i.e., function) of neural networks underlying pain and pain relief anticipation in
diagnostically heterogeneous cohort of Veterans. We will employ advanced neuroimaging (rest and task-based
functional MRI) and advanced statistical approaches to uncover multivariable anticipatory biophenotypes within
Veterans with comorbid pain and trauma. Aim1: To determine the degree to which traumatic stress affects the
capability and integrity of pain anticipation Hypothesis 1a: Traumatic stress will be associated with abnormal
pain anticipation response within insula and amygdala during task-based fMRI; Hypothesis 1b: Traumatic
stress will disrupt fronto-amygdala-insular connectivity at rest. Aim2: To determine the degree to which chronic
pain affects the capability and integrity of relief anticipation. Hypothesis 2a: Chronic pain will be associated with
abnormal pain relief anticipation within insula and cingulate during task-based fMRI; Hypothesis 2b: Chronic
pain will disrupt fronto-striatal-insula connectivity at rest. Exploratory Aim3: Build robust biophenotypes based
on subgrouping anticipatory mechanisms. We will utilize clustering approaches including, but not limited to,
graph-based models. The best model will be determined through analysis of training, test, and validation
samples. Hypothesis 3: We will be able to separate pain anticipation vs. relief anticipation biophenotypes in
diagnostically heterogeneous Veterans with combat trauma and chronic pain. This work will lead to
personalized interventions for our Veterans that are based on their biological profiles. For example, selecting
CBT-based interventions for those with anxiety-avoidance/escape biomechanism vs. interoception-based
interventions for those with relief-related helplessness biomechanism."

For the first time on a national level, we propose to utilize routinely-collected laboratory data to develop a
cohort of pregnant women living with HIV in South Africa in a way that is uniquely robust to transfer across
facilities. South Africa is home to more people living with HIV than any other country, and nearly one in three
pregnant women attending antenatal care is living with HIV. Access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) has
increased substantially since the start of the national ART program in 2004, with >95% ART coverage during
pregnancy and delivery, and mother-to-child transmission of HIV greatly reduced. However, our work has
demonstrated that women who initiate ART during pregnancy are at heightened risk of dropping out of care,
particularly after delivery, leading to the potential for viral transmission, morbidity and mortality. It is difficult to
evaluate the success of policies of expanded access to ART care, and assess continuity of care, due to the
lack of a national longitudinal HIV care database. In addition, patient movement between unlinked facilities
means that self-transfer often is misclassified as loss to care. To address this major shortcoming, our team at
the Health Economics and Epidemiology Office (HE2RO) partnered with the South African National Health
Laboratory Services in 2015 to use existing HIV-related laboratory data to create the South African National
HIV Cohort. Now, through this five-year award, we propose to expand this successful project to use routinely-
collected laboratory data to develop a cohort of pregnant women living with HIV in South Africa. We propose
three specific aims. First, we will develop and validate a novel national cohort of pregnant women accessing
HIV care. Using laboratory test data matched to facility type, we will identify entry to antenatal care to build the
cohort, then describe key treatment milestones, including 1) engagement in antenatal care, 2) initiation of ART,
3) HIV viremia, and 4) continuity of HIV care in the postpartum period. Second, we will measure the effect of
system-wide factors impacting continuity of care among pregnant women. We will assess policies of expanded
treatment access on continuity of care using regression-discontinuity analyses. We then will assess mobility
and its effect on continuity of care during and after pregnancy. Third, we will identify individual-level risk factors
for loss from HIV care in order to develop targeted interventions to improve engagement in HIV care."

Physical inactivity is a grave public health concern as a primary contributor to disease and mortality that also
imposes a massive burden in terms of health costs. Addressing these problems requires the removal of
barriers to physical activity, including biomechanical barriers originating within our own bodies. Humans and
non-human animals alike are more active in adulthood when they have had a more active childhood, but the
reasons for this are not well understood. We propose that physical activity during childhood promotes healthy
development of musculoskeletal structure that reduces the effort associated with movement, thus predisposing
adults to physical activity throughout their lifetimes. Previous work, including our own recent studies using an
avian animal model, supports this idea: The structure of muscles and bones has been shown to adapt to
loading that accompanies activity, and this plastic adaptation is especially pronounced during the growth
period. Further, there is evidence that animals with limited early-life activity have altered muscle mechanical
advantage and exhibit less spontaneous activity as adults. The purpose of the work proposed in this R01
application is to explore these connections between structure, function, and behavior using a rigorous multi-
level experimental approach that spans tissue-level analysis, locomotor analysis, and behavior analysis in
avian (guinea fowl) and mammalian (mouse) animal models, each of which offers distinct advantages.
Specifically, we will: (1) investigate the dose of early-life exercise necessary to produce lasting changes in
musculoskeletal structure, locomotor function, and adult behavior; (2) study the effects of the timing of exercise
onset in childhood on these outcomes; and (3) examine whether there are special benefits for early-life
physical activity in relation to adult-onset exercise. If successful, this work will change our understanding of the
factors influencing physical activity behavior, directly informing new interventions that improve activity-related
health throughout the lifespan."

Concussions are defined as a mild form of traumatic brain injury that result in acute neurological dysfunction.
Recent work suggests post-concussion aerobic exercise at an intensity level below symptom exacerbation is
safe. Yet, clinical benefits from existing randomized controlled trials indicate substantial room for improvement.
Also, we currently have an incomplete understanding of the neurophysiology underlying changes in response to
exercise treatment. Identifying the precise exercise dose (volume/intensity) required to elicit a therapeutic
response following concussion will lead to enhanced and more precise post-concussion rehabilitation strategies.
Our published and pilot data indicate light post-concussion exercise was associated with faster symptom
resolution time and less severe symptoms, yet we relied on self-reported data and observational designs.
Furthermore, we have identified that the optimal exercise volume to differentiate those with/without concussion
symptoms after one month was >160 minutes/week, which is higher than standard exercise volumes prescribed
(>100 minutes/week), and in line with existing recommendations for cardiovascular health (>150 minutes/week).
Beyond this, given the positive effects of regular moderate exercise to reduce inflammation (e.g., interleukin 6)
and restore cerebrovascular regulation, these physiological functions represent viable and feasible rehabilitation
targets. Thus, using a prospective randomized clinical trial design, we aim to identify if high dose exercise >(150
minutes/week at an individualized intensity level), relative to standard-of-care, results in: faster/slower symptom
resolution, altered physiological function, or reduced secondary sequalae. Our multidisciplinary investigative
team has expertise investigating concussion, exercise physiology, fluid biomarkers, cerebrovascular physiology,
and psychosocial outcomes. Thus, we will enroll, initially test, and randomize adolescents ages 13-18 years old
≤10 days post-concussion to high dose aerobic exercise or standard-of-care (symptom limited, self-guided
physical activity), and reassess upon symptom resolution and 8-weeks post symptom resolution. We will obtain
cerebrovascular function and serum biomarker data at each visit, and quantify exercise, symptoms, and
secondary sequalae continuously. First, we aim to examine how the dose (intensity, duration, and frequency) of
an aerobic exercise program initiated within 10 days of concussion affects time to symptom resolution, relative
to standard-of-care, among adolescents. Second, we aim to assess the mechanistic relationship between
aerobic exercise, biomarkers of neuroinflammation, and cerebrovascular function. Third, we aim to elucidate
how high dose exercise after concussion affects persistent secondary sequalae development (anxiety,
depression, kinesiophobia, peer relationships, academic concerns). By challenging the currently accepted,
exercise recommendations for sport-related concussion, we will break new ground toward improving
rehabilitation strategies."
10809734,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Developmental progression from cleavage phase to gastrulation occurs during the mid-blastula
transition (MBT). This transition coincides with several critical events, including maternal to
zygotic transition, zygotic genome activation (ZGA), and stem cell formation. How the zygotic
genome becomes activate and how proper developmental timing is regulated are critical
unknowns in biology. Recent data in zebrafish and Drosophila indicate that these processes are
highly sensitive to the levels a particular histone, the histone variant H2A.Z (H2Av in
Drosophila). However, it remains largely unknown why altered H2A.Z levels disrupt MBT events
and how the embryo ordinarily assures that the correct amount of H2A.Z is incorporated into
chromatin. Preliminary observations indicate that in both species a subset of zygotic genes is
prematurely activated when H2A.Z levels are elevated. A combination of genomics approaches
and expression analysis of candidate genes will be used to determine the temporal pattern of
gene activation in embryos with up- or downregulated nuclear H2A.Z levels. It will also be tested
to what extent the observed changes are due to chromatin associated factors (in particular the
pattern of H2A.Z distribution across the genome) and epigenetic marks. Use of the two distinct
model systems will reveal to what extent the underlying mechanisms are conserved between
vertebrates and insects. In Drosophila, it is known that H2A.Z levels in the nucleus can be
regulated by the H2A.Z binding protein Jabba that sequesters H2A.Z in the cytoplasm, a
process active during the time of the MBT. Preliminary studies have led to the hypothesis that a
different H2A.Z-binding protein plays an analogous role in zebrafish. This hypothesis will be
tested using live imaging, embryo injections, and structure-function analysis. Successful
completion of this project will define the role of H2A.Z in controlling gene expression patterns
and in cellular programming during one of the most crucial periods of development, the mid-
blastula transition."

In 2021, approximately 11 million Americans provided unpaid care to an adult with Alzheimer’s disease and
related dementias (ADRD), which was estimated to be 16 billion hours of assistance valued at $271.6 billion.
Over 65% of older adults with dementia in the community rely on 2 or more family members or friends to meet
their needs, ranging from basic activities of daily living to self-care activities and care decisions. Yet, most
caregiving research has been focused on the roles and care burden, including psychosocial and physical
health, of a single primary caregiver. Given the aging of the population and the changing demographics of what
constitutes a caregiver or care partner in the context of ADRD, the study of caregiving needs to expand to
consider the substantial collaboration and co-management that comprises present day caregiving. Our recent
study to evaluate the scope and potential impact of informal caregiving networks for older persons with
dementia (PWD), using an egocentric social network approach, i.e., based on the informant’s perspective,
revealed that there are complex group dynamics and allocation of care activities, including financial obligation,
among multiple members of a caregiving network. It also revealed the potential impact of these caregiving
networks such that the outcomes of caregivers (e.g., financial hardship) and PWD (e.g., hospital admissions)
may be affected by the characteristics of the caregiving network (e.g., member dynamics). In response to
NOT-AG-21-047, we propose a longitudinal social network study to capture networks of informal caregiving for
408 PWD and assess the impact of caregiving network characteristics on caregivers’ and PWDs’ health and
wellbeing, particularly with regard to the role of social interactions and group dynamics. We will include up to 3
family caregiver informants per network using a multi-informant approach. We estimate that the study will
include ~894 family caregiver informants. We will use Social Vulnerability Index scores to ensure a racially and
socioeconomically diverse sample of PWD. We will characterize informal caregiving networks by describing
network properties (e.g., size, member connectivity), member composition, frequency and type of help the
members provide to the PWD, and level of caregiving role distribution. We will examine the extent of changes
in network characteristics over 2 years and the impact of the network properties on caregiver and PWD
outcomes. Caregiver outcomes will include overall self-rated health, ED visits and hospital admissions,
depression, caregiving burden, rewards of caregiving, and financial hardship. PWD outcomes will include ED
visits and hospital admissions, proxy-reported quality of life, and changes in living arrangements. Our results
will inform strategies for alleviating caregiver burden that take a network perspective into account, such as
supporting the community of informal caregivers rather than solely focusing on a primary caregiver
designation. New strategies would consider caregiving role distribution, network dynamics, and information and
resource sharing to improve the health outcomes of caregivers and PWD."
10807588,"Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer related deaths in American males, and although
death rates have declined, it is still the most diagnosed cancer in males. Having a better
understanding of prostate cancer will help decrease these rates. Calreticulin (CRT) is an Endoplasmic
Reticulum (ER) resident chaperone protein, known to be expressed and regulated by androgen in
prostatic epithelial cells. CRT has been found to migrate to the cell surface in incidences of cancer
where it promotes phagocytic uptake of cancer cells by the immune system. Although surface exposed
CRT concentrations increase in several cancer types, both up and down regulation has been reported
for prostate cancer. Therefore, one goal of this project is to investigate surface exposed CRT
expression in prostate cancer. The method of CRT trafficking to cell surface is unknown but cellular
environment and post-translational modifications may contribute. A proteome-wide study found
numerous proteins to be acetylated in prostate cancer, yet no studies have focused on acetylation of
CRT in prostate cancer. Therefore, another objective of the proposed research project is to evaluate
the role of CRT acetylation on its trafficking to the cell surface in prostate cancer. My preliminary data
suggests CRT structure changes upon binding of acetyl group donor. It also shows double expression
of lysine acetylation and calreticulin present at the cell surface of prostate cancer cells and prostate
cancer tissue samples. Therefore, I hypothesize that CRT acetylation increases its trafficking to the
cell surface in prostate cancer. To test this hypothesis, I propose three Specific Aims: 1) Investigate
trafficking of CRT isoforms in prostate cancer cells, using fluorescently tagged wild type CRT, KDEL
deficient CRT, and CRT with mutated acetylation sites; 2) Understand method and partners of CRT
trafficking, using protein pull down assays followed by advanced proteomic analysis of isoforms
introduced prostate cancer cell lines; 3) Identify expression and location of CRT in prostate cancer
tissue, using immunohistochemical analysis of CRT in a cohort of prostate cancer patients. This K01
proposal is designed to build upon my training background in protein structure/ function changes
upon ligand binding and expand my skills and knowledge as a translational cancer disparities
researcher. My scientific advisory committee is composed of accomplished scientists with expertise in
prostate cancer, cancer health disparities, proteomics, molecular biology, and tumor
microenvironment. The program outlined in this K01 proposal will propel me into an independent
scientific career through rigorous career development activities tailored to my specific research and
career goals."

Cancer cachexia, characterized by muscle wasting, is seen in ~60% of cancer patients and a major contributor
to the morbidity and mortality associated with cancer. Consequently, cachexia is the direct cause of ~1/3 of
cancer-related deaths. We must manage cachexia because preserving muscle and body mass could promote
response to cancer treatment, improve patient physical condition to withstand cancer treatment, and prolong
survival. However, there is no standardized assessment or established treatment for cancer cachexia due to
the poor understanding of its etiology. A major difficulty in understanding cachexia is the high complexity of
cancer milieu, in which many contributing factors have been proposed, but the key mediators of cachexia remain
elusive. Supported by R01 AR063786, we discovered recently that diverse types of cachexia-inducing tumors
release high levels of extracellular Hsp70 & Hsp90 that are associated with extracellular vesicles (EVs), which
is necessary and sufficient for the development of muscle wasting in mice due to their activation of Toll-like
receptor 4 (TLR4) on muscle cells that activates protein degradation pathways. In addition, elevation of serum
Hsp70 & Hsp90 in tumor-bearing mice is required for the elevation of inflammatory cytokines (TNFα and IL-6)
that promote muscle wasting. These data indicate that elevated circulating Hsp70 & Hsp90 are the key driving
force of cancer-induced muscle wasting and systemic inflammation, thus, could be biomarkers and therapeutic
targets of cancer cachexia. These findings provide an opportunity for etiology-based diagnosis and intervention
of cancer cachexia. However, animal models do not always recapitulate complex events that occur in cancer
cachexia in humans, it will be important moving forward to validate the importance of circulating Hsp70 & Hsp90
in human cancer cachexia. Although multiple clinical studies found that serum Hsp70 & Hsp90 levels in cancer
patients increase with the development of pathological grade and clinical stage, and the increase correlates with
mortality, whether elevated serum Hsp70 & Hsp90 correlate with and cause human cancer cachexia are
unknown. Therefore, we propose to test the hypothesis that tumor-released extracellular Hsp70 & Hsp90 are
biomarkers and therapeutic targets of human cancer cachexia. We will conduct a longitudinal patient study to
determine whether elevated serum Hsp70 & Hsp90 are biomarkers of human cancer cachexia that correlate with
natural history of advanced malignancies and clinical outcome. In addition, we will determine whether human
cancer cell release of extracellular vesicle-associated Hsp70 & Hsp90 are causal to muscle wasting and
shortened survival by studying patient-derived primary cancer cells in vitro, and mice bearing patient-derived
xenografts (PDX) of cancer in vivo. Finally, we will conduct experimental therapy of cachexia in PDX-bearing
mice by blocking Hsp70 & Hsp90 release using a pharmacological strategy."

The eukaryotic genome is compacted in a basic repeating structure called chromatin, the anomalous regulation
of which is characteristic of many diseases. In recent years, the technologies to study chromatin have leapt
forward, allowing us to investigate chromosome interactions in three dimensions. However, these methods rely
on measurements taken at a baseline state, thus, a barrier remains to understanding the biological functions of
chromatin in a dynamic system. It has become increasingly evident that viruses manipulate the nuclear
environment to generate viral progeny, necessarily hijacking host chromatin resources for viral benefit.
Therefore, virus infection provides an ideal dynamic system in which to investigate chromatin function. Moreover,
interrogating virus-host interactions has led to advances in virus biology and the discovery of some of the most
profound areas of molecular biology ranging from p53 to splicing. With the recent advances in chromatin
methodologies, we are now in an ideal position to take the next step in understanding chromosome biology in
the three-dimensional context of dynamic biological systems. In this proposal, we aim to employ cutting-edge
chromatin technology combined with virus infection to reveal fundamental chromatin functions. We
focus on nuclear replicating viruses, adenoviruses and multiple herpesviruses, as test cases for the virus to
pinpoint vulnerabilities in chromatin function exploited by pathogens. We have successfully identified three
scenarios in which cellular chromatin is distinctly reorganized for viral benefit: 1) adenovirus protein VII causes
global chromatin reorganization through linker histone displacement to disrupt the cell cycle and impact
transcription; 2) herpes simplex virus infection causes marginalization of host chromatin by generating new
regions of heterochromatin that promote egress of viral progeny; and 3) human cytomegalovirus polarizes
cellular chromatin to generate a functional viral assembly center. We will systematically investigate the
mechanisms by which these dramatic nuclear rearrangements occur in three dimensions using a combination of
high-resolution immunofluorescence microscopy, electron microscopy, and chromosome capture techniques. In
the previous funding period, our approaches defined multiple previously unknown vulnerabilities of chromatin,
positioning us to take the next step into understanding the mechanisms of chromatin organization in the nucleus
in 3D. Completion of these studies will identify new chromatin targets and assist development of innovative
therapies for cancer, inflammation, and viral diseases."

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer mortality in both men and women. Despite
rapid therapeutic advances, the 5-year survival rate of EGFR-mutant NSCLC remains a dismal 16% for the
past several decades. In particular, the rapid emergence of resistance to widely used treatments, such as the
tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), is the key obstacle to achieving long-term NSCLC patient survival. Further,
patients with EGFR mutated tumors fail to respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), leaving them with
little to no hope of a long-term remission. Therefore, identifying the molecular determinants of resistance and
developing a therapeutic that targets the chemo- and immune-resistant pathways, is the best chance to
improve survival rates in NSCLC patients with an EGFR mutation. We hypothesize that MU-CN29, the lead
targeted siRNA nanoconjugate, restores sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors in resistant NSCLC. We further
postulate that MU-CN29 will induce a systemic immune response, priming the tumor microenvironment for
immunotherapy via ICIs. Therefore, the central objective of this TTNCI proposal is to develop, evaluate, and
validate MU-CN29 as an effective therapeutic agent for resistant NSCLC. Our promising in vitro and in vivo
experimental results confirmed the crosstalk between the resistance-driving receptor tyrosine kinase AXL and
FN14 pathways in drug resistant NSCLC. Additionally, we found that the co-knockdown of both AXL and FN14,
using MU-CN29, covalently attached with the dual siRNAs, sensitized the resistant tumors to tyrosine kinase
inhibitor (TKI), in vitro and in vivo. To enable translation of MU-CN29 to human trials, in this proposal, we will
manufacture the nanoparticles as per FDA guidelines, perform detailed toxicology studies in murine and canine
subjects, and evaluate the therapeutic efficacy in clinically relevant animal models. The specific aims of this
applications are: (1) Determine MU-CN29 clinical-grade production protocols; (2) Determine the safety and
efficacy of MU-CN29 in murine NSCLC models; (3) Establish safety of MU-CN29 in canine cancer patients.
The data will validate MU-CN29 nanoparticle platform as a promising strategy to combat drug resistance in
NSCLC and catalyze clinical trials in the future."

In response to PAR-20-317 (NIA MSTEM: Advancing Diversity in Aging Research through Undergraduate
Education [R25]), the University of Arizona Center on Aging (ACOA) proposes to implement the ACOA/
MSTEM THRIVE Program, a substantively focused, structured, longitudinal, mentored research education
program targeting University of Arizona (UA) undergraduates (Freshman through Seniors) from groups
underrepresented in the health sciences (URHS). Students will be recruited from four pre-health programs in
the University of Arizona Health Science Center (UAHS): medicine, nursing, pharmacy and public health.
Students will be principally of Latino and American Indian/Native American descent, or from U.S-México border
regions. The project is supported by the well documented lack of diversity among the research workforce in
aging, the rapid growth of older adults (55 years and older) in diverse groups, and the well documented health
disparities in those groups. Consistent with the NIH Strategic Directions for Research--2020-2025 document,
research education will focus on the interrelationships of the environmental, social, cultural, behavioral, and
biological factors that create and sustain health disparities among older adults. The program will operate within
the context of already existing, world-class resources at UA focused on geriatrics/gerontology research and
education (ACOA), and existing on-campus programs designed to recruit and promote success among
students from groups URHS. The project specific aims are: (1) Develop and sustain undergraduate student
interest, involvement, and retention leading to commitment to a research career focused on our theme of
Improving health, wellbeing and independence of older adults in diverse groups; 2) Develop, sustain and support
undergraduate student engagement in research on our theme by providing students with distinct hands-on
experience, requisite knowledge and research skills; 3) Facilitate and sustain undergraduate student progress
toward achieving career goals and Cultivate and sustain a cadre of culturally competent research mentors to
support MSTEM/ACOA THRIVE students. The innovation of this project lies in our capacity to leverage
excellent, already existing on-campus programs designed to recruit and promote success among students
from groups URHS with nationally recognized resources and researchers in gerontology/geriatrics, with
scientists studying health disparities to improve the health, well-being and independence of older adults in
diverse populations. This project is supported within a research-intensive university that is guided by a
strategic plan to increase diversity and prepare for an aging world."
10809318,"PROJECT SUMMARY and ABSTRACT
Infectious diseases continue to have a major impact on global health. Clinician-investigators have an important
role in addressing infectious diseases through research whose findings can advance the development of new
diagnostic, treatment, and prevention strategies. However, there is a decreasing number of clinician-
investigators in infectious diseases to meet this need. Innovative training schemes to reinvigorate the next
generation of clinician-investigators to address infectious diseases concerns are needed. The University of
Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) is committed to training and retaining a pipeline of clinician-investigators and has
established a physician scientist development office (PSDO) that provides support and resources for this
pipeline. Residency is a pipeline stage with heavy clinical burden and there is a need for mentored research and
training opportunities during residency to help retain those with an interest in a clinician-investigator career. The
goal of the UAB StARR Program is to recruit, train, and accelerate the research independence of UAB resident-
investigators to help build the next generation of clinician-investigators addressing infectious diseases. The
program will achieve its goal through three specific aims: Aim 1 (Pre-StARR Phase): Identify, recruit, and
cultivate resident-investigators interested in infectious diseases who are diverse by gender, race, ethnicity, and
residency specialties – starting in post-graduate year 1, multiple strategies will be used to identify and recruit
resident-investigators for the UAB StARR program from a diverse resident pool within the UAB Internal Medicine,
Pediatrics, OB/GYN, Pathology, and General Surgery residency programs who have interest in infectious
diseases. Aim 2 (StARR Research Phase): Provide mentored research and career development activities for
resident-investigators to promote curiosity in and preparedness for a career involving infectious diseases
investigation - up to 4 residents who apply and are selected for UAB StARR each year will complete a 12-month
program that includes: 1) research mentored by one of 34 preceptors with an excellent mentoring track record
and funding in research on infectious diseases and/or immune mechanisms impacting them, and 2) career
development activities leading to core competencies in research methodology, responsible conduct of research,
communication of findings, scientific writing, and team science. Aim 3 (Post-StARR Phase): Maintain continued
mentorship and career development engagement to retain resident-investigators’ interest and preparedness for
a clinician-investigator pathway - after completing the 12-month StARR program, participants will have continued
mentored research opportunities (up to 12 months), career advising through regular meetings with StARR
leadership and preceptors, and participation in career development activities, research conferences, and a
monthly interactive StARR Cohort “Next Steps” series. The impact of UAB StARR will be the development of a
diverse group of highly motivated, well-trained, early clinician-investigators who are prepared for a successful
transition towards a career as an independent clinician-investigator with a research focus on infectious diseases."

Human tuberculosis (TB) granulomas are complex three-dimensional (3D) lung tissue lesions that form in
response to infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). TB granulomas are comprised of multiple cell types
and are the critical site of host-pathogen interactions that determine disease outcome. The host-pathogen
interaction in TB is complex and different granulomas can either progress or regress in the same individual
concurrently, demonstrating that local granuloma factors determine progression versus protection. Granulomas
expand and organize by the recruitment of additional cells including: monocytes recruited from the blood that
differentiate into macrophages and dendritic cells, stromal fibroblasts which deposit extracellular matrix (ECM)
and secreted factors that influence host cell survival and Mtb growth, and T and B lymphocytes that localize to
the peripheral regions of the granuloma. Despite the importance of these events, the signals that mediate cell
recruitment, aggregation, and function within human TB granulomas are poorly understood, largely due to the
limitations of current experimental models of human TB pathogenesis. To address this need, we have developed
tissue-engineered, self-assembling 3D biomimetic human TB granulomas (BHTGs) from human peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs). BHTGs recapitulate key architectural elements of human TB granulomas: a central
core of mononuclear phagocytes containing live mycobacteria that grows via cell-to-cell spread, progressive
tissue growth and reorganization through the recruitment of monocytes, and 3D cell organization including
internal localization of monocytes and macrophages and the peripheral localization of lymphocytes. In this
proposal, we seek to more fully recapitulate the cellular interactions in TB granulomas and will apply our model
as a biological discovery platform to contribute unprecedented mechanistic and behavioral insight into the factors
governing TB granuloma progression through two Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will identify the contributions of
specific cell types and ECM to BHTG structure, phenotype, and Mtb growth. We will specifically investigate the
signals regulating monocyte differentiation and migratory behavior, and understand microenvironmental factors
that optimize the containment and killing of Mtb. In Aim 2, we introduce a novel 3D model of vascularized human
TB granuloma which will identify the mechanisms by which TB granulomas impact vascular morphogenesis,
barrier function, and endothelial activation to facilitate monocyte homing and local vascular egress. To achieve
these Aims, we have assembled a highly complementary research team with expertise in host immunity to Mtb
(Ernst) and engineered biomimetic human culture models (Kutys). We will establish the long-term foundation for
a new experimental platform to study TB granulomas and generate unprecedented knowledge and
understanding of the dynamics of human TB granuloma generation, differentiation, and maintenance and the
determinants of TB outcomes. Ultimately, these efforts will establish a predictive framework, which can be widely
disseminated and adopted, for the identification and testing of new therapeutics for the control of human TB."

In the inaugural round of the Stimulating Access to Research in Residency (StARR) program, Mayo Clinic’s
residency research training model achieved substantial success. With a focus on heart (and vascular), lung,
hematologic (blood), and sleep (HLBS) disorders/diseases aligned to the priorities of the National Heart, Lung,
and Blood Institute (NHLBI), our program has supported eight resident-investigators, four women and four
men. Three have completed training, while five are currently at various stages of matriculation. With the
objective to enhance the pipeline of clinician-scientists in HLBS fields, the Mayo Clinic StARR program has
developed a model grounded on three straightforward aims. Aim 1: To attract and retain resident-investigators
from diverse cultural and educational backgrounds for academic careers in HLBS disorders/diseases research;
Aim 2: To train and prepare resident-investigators for independent research careers; and Aim 3: To evaluate
the effectiveness and success of the Mayo Clinic StARR Program.
To achieve this model, we built a high supportive and comprehensive environment grounded on three
significant strengths: 1) Experienced and expert faculty of preceptors and research opportunities representing
a broad spectrum of basic, translational, and clinical science; 2) Didactic courses in research training able to
address the needs of residents at this training stage; 3) Career Development scaffolds and guidance that
supports progress toward achieving goals, including downstream career development funding such as the K38,
and continuing on the physician-scientist pathway. Our program is also exceptionally well supported through
recruitment of resident investigators through Mayo Clinic’s own Clinician Investigator Training Program—
expanding a successful model with specific focus on HLBS diseases, an extensive research infrastructure,
numerous resources to develop and maintain research career goals, and the financial commitment of Mayo
Clinic leadership to buttress StARR’s comprehensive design and ensure an outstanding program. Moreover,
this well-integrated model stands on Mayo Clinic’s strong team science culture where preceptors, education,
and support structures all imbue the import of multidisciplinary perspectives to achieve discovery.
In our next cycle, we will continue to enhance the Mayo Clinic StARR program, extending opportunities to
residents in Laboratory Medicine and Pathology and adding experienced preceptors from the same
department. The program will also enhance its recruitment and retention strategies to residents from diverse
backgrounds. We are also enthusiastic to cultivate junior faculty as preceptors, including several talented
researchers in mentor training and tutelage under our more experienced investigators, ensuring a robust and
sustainable StARR program into the future. Thus, an already successful program is poised for even more
impressive outcomes in its second cycle."

Abstract:
 The objective of this proposal is to investigate the biological mechanisms by which microRNAs (miRNAs)
contribute to major depressive disorder (MDD). MDD is a severe mental disorder and the single most common
risk factor for suicide. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of large samples of MDD have for the
first time identified robust genetic associations with major depression. However, the biological mechanisms by
which these increase the risk for major depression are still unknown. Additionally, most genetic variants
associated with MDD fall outside of the protein coding transcriptome, suggesting that their functional impact is
likely to affect gene expression levels rather than protein structure. MiRNA are highly expressed in the brain and
were shown to play an important role in the pathology of psychiatric disorders including MDD and their canonical
functions are to control gene expression levels. Despite their importance, however, profiling of miRNA expression
in large postmortem brain samples for various neuropsychiatric disorders including MDD across different brain
regions currently do not yet exist.
 Thus, in this application we propose to use miRNA sequencing to assess miRNA expression in one of the
largest postmortem brain samples of major depression in the world. The sample has been extensively
characterized clinically, genetically, and molecularly and provides a unique resource for examining the
neurobiological mechanisms by which genetic factors contribute to major depression directly in the primary
affected tissue. Our miRNA data will be integrated with an ongoing RNA sequencing data generated in the same
subjects to identify miRNA/mRNA pairs with important disease functions. Our aims are to: 1) carry out miRNA
sequencing of the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sACC) and amygdala in 200 recurrent MDD cases and
200 matched controls, 2) test whether genome-wide significant SNPs from GWAS of MDD are associated with
miRNA expression across these key regions of the brain, 3) identify miRNA whose expression is associated with
major depression and suicide and perform a series of univariate, multivariate (network), and data integration
analyses to further elucidate miRNA role in the neuropathology of MDD, 4) replicate our top miRNA (FDR ≤5%)
in an independently ascertain postmortem brain sample of 50 MDD cases and 50 matched controls. In aim 4 we
will also perform series of exploratory analyses to identify the cellular mechanism by which risk MDD variants
affect miRNA/mRNA interactions. We hypothesize that a major mechanism contributing to the etiology of major
depression is through the ability of risk MDD variants to affect miRNA expression and functions. By explicating
the mechanisms by which risk MDD variants lead to increase risk of major depression, we will provide novel
targets for intervention in the disease process and, therefore, a more rational basis for improved treatments."

Biomedical research has been increasing exponentially in the last few decades, requiring a
parallel growth in research ethics capacity. Low Middle Income Countries [LMIC] face striking
health care issues due to socioeconomic, cultural, religious, and political turmoil, and need
better research to find solutions for those issues. Pakistan, the fifth largest country of the world
by population, is trying to increase research capacity for health care issues affecting local
populations mandating a supporting effort to build research ethics resources. The proposed
program is one such effort.
Enabling Ethical Research (EnablER): A Capacity Building Program in Pakistan, the
planned project, will have three main aims; 1) Develop a curriculum for two-year advanced
level Master of Bioethics program with special emphasis on Research Ethics, 2) Deliver a two-
year advanced level Master of Bioethics program, and 3) Conduct a needs-assessment of
Research Ethics and Bioethics in leading academic centres of Pakistan through a mixed
method approach.
 This advanced level Master program is for mid-career professionals from different
disciplines enabling them to become leaders in the field capable of spearheading similar
programs in their own institutions and carrying out high-quality research on the contextual
ethical issues. The successful implementation of this program is expected to translate into
improving the overall quality/standards of Bioethics in the four domains namely; research
ethics, clinical ethics, public health ethics, and organizational ethics, with research being
integrated in each domain. The program will be offered on a part-time basis to health
professionals, researchers, pharmacists, physiotherapists, hospital administrators, in addition
to health ministry officials and policy makers, lawyers, medical journalists, social scientists,
philosophers among others, residing in Pakistan. Additionally, the proposal includes a country-
wide mapping exercise of research ethics-related capacity in the country. This is expected to
provide information on the manpower needs, and ethics infrastructure of institutions, which
may be helpful for policy making, resource allocation, and planning of similar training
programs.

10812464,"Project Summary
The major genetic determinant in susceptibility to or protection from many autoimmune diseases reside in the
human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) that contains the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region. In type
1 diabetes (T1D), particular HLA class II alleles (e.g. DR4/DQ8) increase the risk for developing disease,
whereas others (e.g., DQ6, DQB1*06:02) lead to dominant protection. MHC class II molecules function to present
processed antigens to T cells, and the MHC class II−peptide−T cell receptor (TCR) forms a trimolecular complex
involving the presentation of self-peptides that shape autoreactive T cell responses in autoimmunity. The goal of
our studies is to bridge the gap of knowledge in diabetes-protective MHC class II molecules and insulin-specific
T cell responses.
 Data from the last funding period indicates that T1D protective MHC class II molecules (murine IAb ≈ human
DQ6) present insulin, and specifically insulin B chain amino acids 9-23 (B:9-23) to activate CD4 T cells with a
regulatory phenotype (Tregs). In the NOD mouse model of spontaneous autoimmune diabetes, insulin-specific
FoxP3+ Tregs are present but fail to prevent diabetes onset. The presence of IAb in addition to the NOD diabetes
conferring IAg7 MHC class II abrogates all diabetes development. With fluorescent B:9-23 tetramers on each
class II molecule, we are able to detect B:9-23/IAb type 1 regulatory T cells (Tr1 cells) in the pancreatic lymph
nodes in NOD mice heterozygous for IAb/IAg7, while insulin-IAg7 T cells are less frequent and not activated.
Similarly in non-diabetic humans with DQ6, we are able to proliferate Tregs from the peripheral blood that
respond to insulin B:9-21/DQ6. Single cell RNA sequencing of these proliferated insulin-Tregs reveals a distinct
Tr1 cluster that secrete the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10. However, the necessity for these insulin-Tregs and
mechanisms by which these cells confer diabetes resistance remains to be determined. In specific aim 1, we will
determine the molecular phenotype and necessity for insulin-Tregs to protect against diabetes development in
murine models with a diabetes-resistant MHC class II molecule. Specific aim 2 focuses on parallel studies in
humans to identify the protective features of insulin-Tregs restricted to DQ6 and those to DQ8 in individuals with
and without T1D. The successful completion of this proposal will provide insights into the function and molecular
phenotype of insulin-Tregs restricted to diabetes-protective MHC class II molecules and determine their direct
role in conferring diabetes protection, thus aiding the design of therapies that may improve Treg function to treat
the underlying autoimmunity in T1D."
10812359,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Coordinated gastrointestinal (GI) tract motility is fundamental for normal GI tract function. Several cell types
combine to regulate GI motility, with the smooth muscle cell (SMC) as the workhorse required to provide the
physical power for contractions. Disruptions in SMC function contribute to common GI disorders, may occur after
infections and inflammation, and associate with rare but devastating GI motility disorders like visceral myopathies
and pseudo-obstruction. The gut wall is a highly complex multilayered structure under mechanical stress at
baseline and constantly moving. Therefore, cells in the GI tract experience a range of types and amounts of
mechanical stimuli. The normal coordinated motility requires an ability to sense and adjust to forces. In multiple
cycles of this grant, we have dissected mechanisms of smooth muscle mechanotransduction, have made
discoveries that advanced GI physiology and pathophysiology, and provided novel drug targets. However, our
current understanding of SMC mechanosensing remains incomplete. It is established that SMCs, even as single
cells, adjust their contractions in response to force in a process called the myogenic reflex. In vascular SMCs,
the myogenic reflex depends on mechanogated ion channels, but in the GI tract, cellular and molecular
mechanisms remain poorly understood. Therefore, the overall objective of our research is to determine the
primary mechanogated ion channels involved in GI SMC mechanosensitivity. For this proposal, we created novel
animal models and used cutting-edge techniques to generate compelling preliminary data. Our preliminary
studies show that a recently discovered mechanogated ion channel Tmem63a is expressed in a subpopulation
of SMCs, which are optimized for force sensing and distributed across the tissue to detect force. Indeed
mechanosensitive ionic currents in a population of primary mouse GI SMCs have unique biophysical properties
consistent with Tmem63a, the activation of which by force leads to a Ca2+ increase, modulating small and large
bowel contractions and whole gut transit time. Interestingly, our data also show that patients with slow transit
constipation have a decrease in Tmem63a. Thus, the central hypothesis that a mechanogated ion channel
Tmem63a significantly contributes to the myogenic reflex will be tested in two Aims. In Aim 1, we determine
Tmem63a function, its response to force, and its role in GI SMCs using conventional and cutting-edge techniques
electrophysiology and Ca2+ imaging approaches. In Aim 2, we propose experiments to define the Tmem63a+
SMC population and to determine the role of Tmem63a SMCs in regulating GI smooth muscle function. Since
Tmem63a is found in a subpopulation of SMCs, we use single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, novel Ca2+
imaging, smooth muscle contractility assays and in vivo whole gut transit. Successful completion of the proposed
innovative experiments has both basic significance and clinical impact, evaluating and establishing a novel SMC
mechanogated ion channel which contributes to SMC function and the myogenic reflex and, in the long term,
may provide a novel target for functional and motility GI disorders."

Persistent and chronic pain are facilitated by plasticity of sensory afferents. Recent advances demonstrate this
plasticity is initiated and maintained by de novo translation of pro-nociceptive genes. In animal models,
pharmacological and genetic perturbations of protein translation have shown therapeutic efficacy. Therefore,
discovery of proteins that selectively regulate pro-nociceptive mRNA translation in sensory neurons would
provide opportunities for the development of novel targeted therapeutics. mRNA translation is regulated by
RNA-Binding proteins (RBPs). Our analyses of single cell RNA-Seq data confirmed by histological
assessments revealed the presence of a RBP restricted to subpopulations of dorsal root ganglion (DRG)
nociceptive neurons. Previous studies indicate that this RBP binds to and inhibits translation of mRNA
transcripts associated with neuronal excitability. Our computational analyses predicted that this nociceptor-
restricted RBP would suppress a constellation of ion channels, neuropeptides and other “pain genes”, thereby
forming a putative anti-nociceptive regulon. This proposal will test the hypothesis that this identified RBP
tonically suppresses nociceptive transmission by binding to and inhibiting translation of pro-nociceptive
mRNAs. This proposal will determine if enhancing the function of this RBP is a viable strategy to develop
interventions that normalize pain thresholds and reverse chronic pain. In doing so these investigations will
demonstrate a novel anti-nociceptive regulon that scales the threshold for pain perception and validate use of a
tool to discover factors responsible for the transition"
10812506,"Summary / Abstract
Objective — The goal of this proposal is to develop and optimize novel deep learning (DL) assisted approaches
to improve diagnosis and clinical decision-making for congenital heart disease (CHD). This will be achieved by
using DL, machine learning (ML), and related methods to extract diagnosis, biometric characterizations, and
other information from fetal ultrasound imaging. Notably, this work includes a clinical translational evaluation of
these methods in a population-wide imaging collection spanning two decades, tens of thousands of patients, and
several clinical centers. Background — Despite clear and numerous benefits to prenatal detection of CHD and
an ability for fetal ultrasound to detect over 90% of CHD lesions in theory, in practice the fetal CHD detection
rate is closer to 50%. Prior literature suggests a key cause of this startling diagnosis gap is suboptimal acquisition
and interpretation of fetal heart images. DL is a novel data science technique that is proving excellent at pattern
recognition in images. DL models are a function of the design and tuning of a neural network architecture, and
the curation and processing of the image data used to train the network. Preliminary Studies — We have
assembled a multidisciplinary team of experts in echocardiography and CHD (Drs. Grady, Levine, and Arnaout),
DL and data science (Drs. Keiser, Butte and Arnaout), and statistics and clinical research (Drs. Arnaout and
Grady) and secured access to tens of thousands of multicenter (UCSF and six other centers), multimodal fetal
imaging studies. We have created a scalable image processing pipeline to transform clinical studies into image
data ready for computing. We have designed and trained DL models to find key cardiac views in fetal ultrasound,
calculate standard and advanced fetal cardiac biometrics from those views, and distinguish between normal
hearts and certain CHD lesions. Hypothesis — While DL is powerful, much work is still needed to adapt it for
clinical imaging and to translate it toward clinically relevant performance in patient populations. We hypothesize
that an integrated ensemble DL/ML approach can lead to vast improvements in fetal CHD diagnosis. Aims —
To this end, the main Aims of this proposal are (1) to develop and optimize neural network architectures and
efficient data inputs to relieve key performance bottlenecks for DL in fetal CHD; and (2) to deploy DL models
population-wide to evaluate their ability to improve diagnosis, biometric characterization, and precision
phenotyping over the current standard of care. Our methods include DL/ML algorithms and retrospective imaging
analysis. Environment and Impact — This work will be supported in an outstanding environment for research
at the crossroads of data science, cardiovascular and fetal imaging, and translational informatics. The work
proposed will provide valuable tools and insight into designing and evaluating both the data and the algorithms
for DL on imaging for clinically relevant goals, and will lay important groundwork for DL-assisted phenotyping for
both clinical use and precision medicine research."

Overall Program Description: Human pregnancy and parturition are fascinating and biologically complex
phenomena. Two independent physiological systems, namely the fetus and the mother, co-exist for a defined
period of time to maintain pregnancy, aid fetal growth and development.1 This co-existence ends with parturition,
a unique synchronized process that terminates all homeostatic states of pregnant uterine tissues2-6.
Unfortunately, an unacceptable and growing number of pregnancies do not end at term with a delivery of a fully
developed fetus. Approximately 25-30% of the 3.5 million births per year in the United States alone occur in the
context of a range of placenta-, fetal membrane-, decidua/myometrium-, and/or cervix (maternal)-mediated
adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preterm birth, preeclampsia, small-for-gestational-age birth, gestational
diabetes, and others.7-10 Globally, preterm labor and delivery (birth at <37 weeks of gestation) accounts for 15
million births and 1 million neonatal deaths per year. 11-14 Survivors of adverse pregnancy outcomes face lifelong
challenges, and mothers who deliver preterm often face medical complications.15-17 Therefore, reducing the risk
of adverse pregnancy outcomes is a global need;13,18 however, pregnant women are excluded from most clinical
trials.19-23 Instead, “women who may become pregnant” are a population of interest in drug development. Indeed,
unique physiological characteristics of the mother-fetus co-existence during pregnancy are difficult to study.
Challenges in conducting research and/or drug development in pregnancy include (i) recruitment hurdles due to
paucity of data needed to convince the clinicians, subjects, and regulators on the utility of a drug in pregnancy,
(ii) lack of suitable preclinical models (in vitro or animal models) to address both pharmacokinetics and
pharmacodynamics, and (iii) absence of informative biomarkers to assess the feto-placental response to
therapeutics. These limitations lead to systematic exclusion of pregnant women from medical interventions and
therapeutics research.20,24 Recent advances in our group’s efforts to create a suite of five pregnancy and
women's health-focused human microphysiological systems (MPS) that model 'healthy' and 'disease' states of
intrauterine tissues25-32 present a unique opportunity to translate them into drug development tools. These MPS
use cell lines created from both human placenta and lower and upper uterine tissues (feto-maternal membrane),
to faithfully recreate the mother-fetus interface in pregnancy, parturition, and in adverse pregnancy outcomes.
Collectively, these MPS and cells form a RESOURCE for drug development that will be tested for its suitability
under several drug development contexts of use with a range of small molecules and a biological agent. We will
also use our years of experience testing a wide range of MPS for their utility in drug safety evaluation to QUALIFY
these MPS for their specific contexts of use and seek regulatory approval for their use as drug development
tools. Collectively, this Center addresses a clear need by translating five pregnancy and women's health MPS
into drug development tools for repurposing or testing newly developed drugs that can be used during pregnancy."
10816478,"Abstract: Colon cancer (CoCa) remains the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths because
chemotherapeutics currently offered to treat early and advanced CoCa fail to achieve optimal clinical response,
and patients often develop resistance and suffer severe toxicity. Therefore, a more efficacious treatment option
with lower toxicity is crucial to improve CoCa clinical outcomes. To achieve this objective, we propose
investigating the role of CC chemokine receptor 6 (CCR6) and its ligand CCL20 on cellular and molecular
mechanisms contributing to the poor outcome of currently offered chemotherapeutics (5FU and Oxaliplatin) and
develop more effective and less toxic treatment. The proposed investigation is based on our published and
preliminary data showing (i) higher CCR6 expression in CoCa cells and tissues; (ii) CCR6 expression positively
correlates with disease stage; (iii) CCR6/CCL20 is biologically active and promotes migration and invasion of
CoCa, (iv) CCR6/CCL20 activates β-catenin, Snail, vimentin, α-SMA and down regulates E-cadherin indicating
the significance of this axis in maintaining mesenchymal phenotype known to be less responsive to
chemotherapy. Based on this, we hypothesize that the CCR6-CCL20 axis supports cellular and molecular
reprogramming to escape chemotherapeutics and developing therapeutics directed to CCR6/CCL20 will improve
chemotherapeutic efficacy. The hypothesis will be tested using the following aims. Aim 1: Define the CCR6-
mediated molecular mechanism(s) associated with the poor chemotherapeutic response. Under this aim,
using genomics and proteomics approach, we will determine the impact of the CCR6/CCL20 axis on the
molecular detour cancer cells take to promote cellular and molecular phenotypes that help omit cytotoxic effects
of conventional chemotherapeutics. Additionally, we will ascertain if blocking CCR6/CCL20 axis will improve
cytotoxicity of 5-FU and Oxaliplatin at a suboptimal dose. Further, using clinical samples, we will establish the
impact of CCR6/CCL20 on chemotherapeutic response. Aim 2: Determine the effect of CCR6 inhibition on
the chemotherapeutic response in vivo. Using xenograft and syngenic murine model, this aim will determine
the impact of CCR6/CCL20 axis inhibition on the efficacy of 5-FU and Oxaliplatin in vivo. The syngenic model
will allow us to ascertain the effects of CCR6/CCL20 inhibition on systemic and tumor immunity with or without
5-FU and Oxaliplatin. Endpoint analysis of tumor and serum will determine the alteration in cellular and molecular
mechanisms involved in improving the chemotherapeutic efficacy and organ toxicity. Completing this aim will
provide the rationale for using CCR6/CCL20 directed therapy as a new treatment modality. This proposed
research is novel since the impact of CCR6/CCL20 on cellular and molecular reprogramming contributing to poor
5-FU and Oxaliplatin response is untested both in vitro and in vivo. Information obtained from this study will be
significant in designing a highly efficacious treatment combination with minimal toxicity. This anticipated
treatment option will improve CoCa clinical outcomes and patient’s quality of life."

This is an application for a Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) to support the career
development efforts of Dr. Nasim Maleki, including enhanced training in an integrated cross-disciplinary
program consisting of in-depth experience in alcoholism neuroscience and pathophysiology under the
mentorship of Dr. Marlene Oscar Berman, an expert at the forefront of research on alcohol abuse disorder
(AUD), and a team of leading experts in alcoholism, pain, neuroimaging, and statistical modeling. The proposed
research is an interdisciplinary study that would bridge AUD research with pain research and as such, allows
insights into alcoholism as a risk factor for development of chronic pain disorders, and vice versa. Dr. Maleki
aims to leverage neuroimaging and neuropsychiatric data from a large cohort of abstinent long-term alcoholic
men and women, to develop retroactive insights and predictive models for chronic pain. Aim 1 seeks to
determine whether AUD is associated with damage to the descending pain modulatory network (DPMN)
pathways. Aim 2 is to gather further insights into potential abnormalities in the DPMN associated with AUD by
performing quantitative sensory testing in AUD patients. Finally, Aim 3 will determine whether presence of
depressive or stress symptoms are predictive of chronic pain development in AUD. As chronic pain syndromes
have the propensity to trigger the risk of re-initiation of alcohol abuse in abstinent alcoholics, it is important to:
(a) characterize pain related abnormalities associated with AUD; (b) understand neural links between AUD and
chronic pain; and (c) ultimately identify markers that predict the risk of development of chronic pain in abstinent
alcoholics. The findings should allow early detection of AUD patients at risk for developing chronic pain
conditions, and earlier start of interventional approaches to reduce the risk of consequent alcohol abuse or
relapse."

 Low-grade inflammatory monocytes are increasingly recognized as key contributors for the pathogenesis of
atherosclerosis through their enhanced recruitment and retention within the atherosclerotic plaques, as well as
their compromised ability of cleaning up necrotic cell debris. However, mechanisms responsible for resolving
monocyte inflammation are poorly understood, thus hindering translational efforts in resolving monocyte-
mediated inflammatory polarization and the treatment of atherosclerosis. The PI recently reported that the
training of low-grade inflammatory monocytes requires the critical cellular TLR4 adaptor molecule TRAM. Our
data show that TRAM is uniquely responsible for the inflammatory polarization of monocytes, through a novel
mechanism in disrupting pexophagy-mediated peroxisome homeostasis. Tram-/- monocytes have elevated
PPAR and PEX5, enhanced pexophagy, reduced ROS, and reduced inflammatory polarization. Intriguingly,
Tram-/- monocytes also express increased anti-inflammatory mediators (RvD1 and CD200R) characteristic of
“resolving” monocytes, and can actively propagate resolution to neighboring monocytes through CD200R in vitro
and in vivo. Tram-/- mice exhibit reduced development of atherosclerosis. Transfusion of Tram-/- resolving
monocytes can reduce atherosclerosis pathogenesis. Based on these novel findings, the long term goal is to
define novel therapeutic targets for sustaining monocyte homeostasis and preventing/treating atherosclerosis.
The current objective is to define molecular and cellular mechanisms by which TRAM may serve as a key switch
controlling the generation of either inflammatory or resolving monocytes relevant to the pathogenesis or
treatment of atherosclerosis. The central hypothesis is that TRAM deletion will not only block the polarization of
low-grade inflammatory monocytes, but also enable the generation and propagation of resolving monocytes
conducive for the treatment of atherosclerosis, through enhancing peroxisome homeostasis. To test this
hypothesis, the following integrated studies will be conducted. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that the TRAM-
PSMB10 circuitry drives the inflammatory polarization of low-grade inflammatory monocytes through disrupting
pexophagy. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that TRAM deletion and reduction of immunoproteasome PSMB10
enable the generation of anti-inflammatory resolving monocytes through sustained activation of PPAR
/peroxisome homeostasis. Aim 3 will test the translational hypothesis that resolving monocytes with enhanced
peroxisome homeostasis can propagate resolution memory and reduce the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.
Together, the proposed studies will advance the field of innate immune memory, by delineating the novel role of
TRAM-circuitry in the training of “inflammatory” vs “resolving” monocytes, bearing translational relevance to the
pathogenesis and treatment of atherosclerosis."
10816594,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
A fundamental function of the nervous system is to determine salience of sensory stimuli in the environment
and accordingly regulate attentional response to them. Salience is dynamic. What is salient to an animal
changes from moment to moment in accord with its experience and current physiological need. A prime
example observed widely across species is the salience of food-associated stimuli. These stimuli are salient for
food-deprived animals and therefore demand their attention. By contrast, food-associated stimuli lose their
salience when animals become satiated. This indicates that neural circuits that control attentional behavior
integrates the information of hunger and satiety. Appropriately determining salience based on current need and
thereby regulating attention is essential for survival and its dysregulation is associated with neuropsychiatric
disorders. However, it is not known what neural circuits mediate attentional behavior and how these circuits
integrate internal information of hunger and satiety. Here we propose to use Drosophila as a model to dissect
neural circuits that control attentional behavior to food-associated olfactory stimuli in accord with hunger and
satiety. We employ a multidisciplinary approach that combines a novel behavioral assay, a novel bidirectional
neural activity reporter, genetic and optogenetic manipulations, and in vivo recording of neural activity to test
our hypothesis that a dopamine-modulated olfactory center, the mushroom body, plays a key role in
appropriately computing salience of food-associated odors based on current hunger state. In Aim 1, we will
establish that the salience of food odor is modulated by hunger state and will determine the role of mushroom
body in generating attentional response to olfactory stimuli. In Aim 2, we will identify hunger-sensitive
dopamine neurons, whose activity is modulated by signals reflecting hunger and satiety. In Aim 3, we will
identify mushroom body output that integrates information of food odors and hunger state to drive attentional
behavior. Together, our studies will reveal the neural mechanisms that regulate attentional behavior in
response to food-associated odors in accord with hunger state. The functional organization of the Drosophila
mushroom body exhibits remarkable similarity to that of the mammalian striatum and its dopamine input, and
the dopamine circuits in mammals have long been implicated in computation of salience. Therefore, we expect
that our project will contribute to providing an understanding of the operational principles of neural circuits that
mediate salience determination."

Project Summary/Abstract
Since its inception, the UC Irvine Alzheimer Disease Research Center (ADRC) has included people with Down
syndrome (DS) as a central focus of its research mission. Because of the triplication of the APP gene on
chromosome 21, individuals with DS accumulate amyloid in the brain over the lifespan. This places people with
DS at substantially increased risk for dementia. Yet, the age of symptom onset is variable and there is need for
increased understanding of the temporal sequence of events in the AD pathogenesis as well as factors that
precipitate dementia and protect against it. This application represents the launch of an independent DS Core
in the ADRC, an exciting development that will increase opportunities for the study of DS and AD at UCI and
beyond. Establishing a DS Core will facilitate interactions between this and other ADRC Cores, especially new
cores being initiated, such as the Biomarker Core, and will enhance opportunities for data sharing. The DS
Core will continue to engage in longitudinal research. The Core will expand the population enrolled, including
participants as young as 18 years of age, to better elucidate the earliest possible stages of disease. Special
emphasis will be placed on developing tools to facilitate multisite DS research, including clinical trials. As
always, the expert investigators studying the DS and AD will contribute their unique expertise and experiences
to training the next generation of clinicians and scientists. The DS Core will continue to provide unique insights
into the understanding of AD."

The overall objective of the 90+ Core is to expand the integration of The 90+ Study's (R01AG20055, MPI: C.
Kawas, M. Corrada) data and resources into the research environment of the UCI ADRC. The 90+ Study is an
ongoing longitudinal study of the oldest-old at UCI that has been operating for 16 years and has acquired an
unparalleled amount of high-quality data from well-characterized participants including clinical, imaging,
genetic, and neuropathological data. The study has become an invaluable resource for research on the oldest-
old, people 90 years of age and older. The oldest-old represent the fastest growing segment of the population
and have the highest rates of dementia. Yet, oldest-old individuals are severely understudied as they are often
excluded from research. The 90+ Core includes participants from The 90+ Study who have agreed to brain
autopsy or brain imaging. The 90+ Core will act as a centralized resource to improve the capacity for much-
needed research in the oldest-old and will enable effective management and coordination of resources and
collaboration between The 90+ Study and the ADRD research environment within and beyond the UCI ADRC.
The efficient sharing and distribution of data and resources will encourage research in the oldest-old with the
ultimate goal of understanding dementia and its pathological underpinnings, cognitive impairment, resilience,
and the role of biomarkers in our oldest citizens.
The 90+ Core will coordinate brain donation and post-mortem brain MRI from participants who have agreed to
autopsy, will increase recruitment of individuals from underrepresented ethnicities into our autopsy and
imaging studies, and will identify participants relevant to other ADRC investigators. In addition, The 90+ Core
will also assemble and maintain an easily accessible, de-identified, interlinked data resource that includes
clinical, biomarker, genetics, and neuropathology data to facilitate resource sharing and will develop strategies
for handling analytic problems particularly relevant to research in the oldest-old. Finally, with particular
expertise for conducting studies of the oldest-old, The 90+ Core will contribute to the education and training of
the next generation of ADRD clinicians and researchers.
In close collaboration with other Cores and the Research Education Component, The 90+ Core will provide
opportunities to connect and collaborate and will serve as a centralized resource to facilitate and encourage
novel research in the oldest-old across the UCI ADRC and larger AD ecosystem."

10817138,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Healthcare provider profiling is of nationwide importance. In order to identify extreme (poor or excellent)
performance and to intervene as necessary, outcomes of patients associated with specific healthcare providers
are routinely monitored by both government and private payers. This monitoring can help patients make more
informed decisions, and can also aid consumers, stakeholders, and payers in identifying providers where
improvement may be needed, and even closing or fining those with extremely poor outcomes.
Our endeavor is motivated by the study of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), which represents 7.2% of the
entire Medicare budget and is of interest due to its heavy burden on patients, families, and the healthcare
system. Existing profiling approaches for analyzing large-scale ESRD registry data assume the risk adjustment
is perfect and the between-provider variation is entirely due to the quality of care, which is often invalid. As a
result, these methods disproportionately identify larger providers, although they need not be “extreme.'' To
address this problem, Aim 1 develops an individualized empirical null approach for profiling healthcare
providers to account for the unexplained between-provider variation due to imperfect risk adjustment.
The national dialysis data contains more than 3,000 comorbidities from over 2,000,000 patients who are
treated from more than 7,000 facilities. The goal is to select important comorbidity indexes for risk adjustment
of provider profiling. However, the use of large-scale databases introduces computational difficulties,
particularly when the event of interest is recurrent, and the numbers of sample size and the dimension of
parameters are large. Traditional methods that perform well for moderate sample sizes and low-dimensional
data do not scale to such massive data. Another challenging aspect of the national dialysis dataset is that
patient information is updated sequentially. How to integrate streaming recurrent event data adds another
level of difficulty. In view of these difficulties, Aim 2 proposes a nested divide-and-conquer-based boosting
procedure for high-dimensional variable selection with large-scale clustered recurrent event data. The
proposed procedure is further combined with a model updating procedure based on the time-dependent
Kullback-Leibler discrimination information to integrate streaming recurrent event data.
Finally, the COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically changed how healthcare care is delivered, and statisticians
have an important role to play in supporting providers and patients through this evolution. Aim 3 proposes a
latent illness-death model to account for temporal and geospatial variation of COVID prevalence in the provider
profiling. This analysis is needed to evaluate provider performance more accurately, to help physicians focus
on groups of patients with excess risk, and to aid providers in determining corrective actions to improve their
performance.
The research in Aim 4 is to develop publicly available software to enable the utilization of the proposed
approaches."

 Chronic pancreatitis provides proliferative advantage to oncogene-harboring pancreatic cells, shields
transformed cells from anti-tumor factors, and stimulates the metastatic process. Accordingly, pancreatic
inflammation emerges as an important factor in the development and progression of pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma (PDA), which is a lethal disease with low survival rate. A better understanding of the anti-
tumorigenic targets of pancreatic inflammation is critical for developing novel approaches to efficient therapies.
In proposed here studies, we focus on the importance of type I interferons (IFN1) cytokines that act through
IFNAR1 receptor to elicit a cell-autonomous tumor suppressive effects (e.g. cell senescence) in oncogene-
harboring cells. Our preliminary results suggest that this pathway is inactivated in response to pancreatic
inflammation-induced ubiquitination-dependent downregulation of IFNAR1 or through silencing of downstream
effectors such as IFN1-inducible metabolic enzyme cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H). Our new exciting
results include the observations that (i) IFNAR1 and CH25H are often lost in human PDA and mouse models of
PDA, (ii) re-expression of CH25H in human and mouse PDA cells inhibits their proliferation/survival, and (iii)
that genetic ablation of CH25H in mice stimulates PDA development. Based on these data we propose an
overarching hypothesis that inactivation of the IFN1-IFNAR1-CH25H pathway promotes PDA development and
progression. To test this hypothesis, we will characterize the IFN1-IFNAR1-CH25H pathway in human and
mouse PDA and determine the effects of inactivation of IFNAR1 in vitro and in vivo on growth of pancreatic
organoid cultures and development of PDA in mice. Conversely, cell-based and in vivo models deficient in
IFNAR1 ubiquitination and downregulation will help to assess the importance of IFNAR1 loss in PDA
development and progression. Furthermore, we propose to determine the tumor suppressive role of CH25H. We
will use the organoid/cell-based models to delineate the mechanisms underlying the loss of CH25H induction by
IFN1 in PDA cells and a novel conditional knockout model of CH25H to determine its importance in counteracting
PDA development. We will also conduct preclinical studies using Liver X Receptor agonists (that act downstream
of CH25H) against PDA in immunocompetent mice. Completion of these studies will determine the role of the
IFN1-IFNAR1-CH25H pathway in PDA pathogenesis and delineate the mechanisms of inactivation of this
pathway in PDA. We anticipate that future targeting of these mechanisms may be used for PDA treatment."

This K01 will provide the principal investigator, Dr. Karey O’Hara, with training and mentored research experiences
that will support her transition to an independent intervention scientist specializing in the development of optimized
preventive programs for children exposed to uncontrollable stressors that are theory-driven, effective, and scalable.
The focus of this K01 is on children’s exposure to interparental conflict after divorce. The training plan provides (1)
skills in intervention development and evaluation, including the multiphase optimization strategy (MOST)20
framework, ecological momentary assessment (EMA), theory-based intervention development, and randomized
controlled trials (RCTs), (2) experience in applying user-centered design (UCD)8,9 strategies to encourage
implementation success. These training goals will be accomplished through workshops (e.g., MOST, UCD, EMA)
and coursework (e.g., seminars on experimental and quasi-experimental design, web-based program design,
theory-based programs for divorce), as well as didactic instruction (i.e., directed readings), hands-on training (i.e.,
large-scale RCT, analysis of existing EMA data), and mentored research experiences. The proposed K01 training
and research activities will be executed at Arizona State University’s (ASU’s) Department of Psychology and
Research and Education Advancing Children’s Health (REACH) Institute. Primary mentorship will be provided by
Dr. Sharlene Wolchik (ASU; expert in children’s mental health and parental divorce, intervention development and
evaluation) and co-mentorship will be provided by Dr. Irwin Sandler (ASU; expert in children’s stress and coping,
parental divorce, intervention development and evaluation) and Dr. Stephen West (ASU; expert in factorial design,
causal inference, longitudinal analysis, program evaluation). In addition, Dr. O’Hara will receive training from Dr.
Linda Collins (Penn State; developer of MOST), Dr. E. Mark Cummings (University of Notre Dame; expert in
interparental conflict), Dr. Aaron Lyon (University of Washington; expert in UCD strategies), and Dr. Harry Reis
(University of Rochester; expert in EMA). The overarching objective of the proposed projects is to develop an
optimized intervention for children exposed to high post-divorce interparental conflict, as this is a leading risk factor
for mental health problems in children who experience divorce. To achieve Aim 1, I will use UCD strategies
(surveys, focus groups, quantitative measures, user-testing) to ascertain information from potential end-users on
needs, preferences, usability, and satisfaction. To achieve Aim 2, I will apply MOST and conduct a factorial
optimization trial to isolate effects of web-based coping intervention components. This research aligns with the
NIMH “experimental therapeutics” approach to intervention development and evaluation."

Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive breast cancer subtype with no targeted treatment
available. Although we have made tremendous progress in regards to the genetic drivers of this disease, we
have limited understanding of the epigenomic alterations that drive specific molecular subtypes of breast
cancers. The epigenome consists of an array of chromatin modifications, which collectively form a dynamic
chromatin state that impinges upon gene expression networks critical for maintaining cellular identity.
Therefore, specific epigenomic alterations may act as drivers of different molecular phenotypes, however we
have limited understanding of how specific chromatin patterns may be associated with specific molecular
signatures such as basal-like breast cancer. Since epigenetic enzymes are targetable and epigenetic
processes are reversible in nature, they could prove to be excellent targets for novel therapeutic strategies
against specific molecular phenotypes. Our preliminary data suggests tumor suppressor activities for UBR7, a
novel histone modifier, in triple negative breast cancer. We show that UBR7 acts as a E3 ubiquitin ligase for
monoubiquitination of histone H2B at K120 residue and may transcriptionally regulate molecular signatures for
invasive breast cancers. These data provide rationale for in depth characterization of tumor-suppressor
function of UBR7 and identification of therapeutic vulnerabilities imparted by UBR7 loss. Our hypothesis is
that UBR7 is a potent tumor suppressor in triple negative breast and promotes invasive behavior in triple-
negative breast cancer partly by regulation of cadherin pathway. The objective of this proposal is to first
perform in depth characterization of UBR7 tumor-suppressor activity using mouse models, elucidation of
downstream cellular processes/pathways and identification of inhibitors/protein targets to inhibit in UBR7-low
triple-negative breast cancers. We aim to 1) characterize tumor-suppressor role of UBR7 and determine the
genetic context in which UBR7 loss promotes triple-negative breast cancers; 2) determine if UBR7 loss
promotes EMT and breast cancer metastasis by alteration of chromatin states and Cadherin genes; and 3)
determine genetic and pharmaceutical vulnerabilities of UBR7-deficient triple negative breast cancers. Overall,
our studies will provide significant advances in understanding role of epigenome in triple-negative breast
cancer tumor progression and define molecular mechanisms underlying contribution of new histone modifier to
cancer development."
10817157,"HCV and HBV represent the leading cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The risk of HCC remains even
after virus elimination. Thus, it is of the utmost importance to identify novel approaches to treat viral hepatitis-
induced HCC. We identified a novel class of small compounds called sanglifehrin derivates (SfDer), which
possess antiviral and anti-cellular activities critical for preventing viral hepatitis-induced HCC development.
Recent findings highlight that our application is highly significant: i) HCC represents the fastest growing cause
of cancer mortality; ii) Recent studies raised a red flag regarding unexpected higher rates of HCC recurrence
following DAA treatment, indicating that viral hepatitis-associated HCC remains an unresolved and significant
public health issue; iii) Patients with HCC are 8 times more likely to fail DAA treatment than patients without
HCC; iv) The FDA confirmed the high risk of HBV reactivation after DAA therapy; and v) Besides sorafenib,
which improves survival by only 2-3 months, >100 trials evaluating therapies for HCC failed to show survival
advantages. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the identification of new combinations of drugs with distinct
mechanisms of action (MoA) that concurrently inhibit HCV/HBV infections and viral hepatitis-induced HCC.
We demonstrated that SfDer possess remarkable activities critical for the treatment of viral hepatitis infection
and HCC: i) SfDer suppress HCV and HBV replication in vitro as well as in mice even when viral replication in
implanted hepatocytes is robust; ii) SfDer are not cytotoxic even when used at high doses; iii) SfDer, but not
another class of structurally distinct cyclophilin inhibitors (CypI) – cyclosporine A derivates (CsADer) – possess
the unique property of stopping growth of hepatoma cells, but not that of hepatocytes; iv) SfDer inhibit in vitro
and in vivo HCV and HBV replication in human hepatocytes, which are resistant to the SfDer-mediated
cytostaticity, demonstrating authentic antiviral activities unrelated to their cytostatic activities; v) SfDer inhibit
viral hepatitis-induced HCC; vi) SfDer inhibit HCC in a nonviral-induced HCC mouse model; and vii) SfDer
modulate hepatic levels of cytokines during HCC development. Thus, SfDer represent novel attractive drugs
to be part of therapies for HCV and HBV mono- and co-infections as well as viral hepatitis-induced HCC.
In Aim 1, we will investigate SfDer efficacy at inhibiting viral hepatitis infection and HCC induction in mice. We
will examine whether the inclusion of SfDer into DAA regimens improves their beneficial effect against viral
hepatitis infection and HCC induction, whether HCV/HBV co-infection induces more severe HCC than mono-
infection, and whether SfDer inhibit co-infection and co-infection-induced HCC. In Aim 2, we will investigate
whether the newly identified cyclophilin A-HBx interactions, which are prevented by SfDer, are critical for HBV
replication. In Aim 3, we will investigate the efficacy of SfDer at preventing nonviral-induced HCC. We also will
investigate at a molecular level the MoA that allow SfDer to stop hepatoma cell growth (not hepatocytes) – a
unique property that may contribute to their anti-HCC impact."
10817162,"High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is responsible for nearly 5% of the global cancer burden. HPV infect stratified squamous epithelia and virus replication depends upon epithelial differentiation. To enable virus replication in differentiating cells, HPV-encoded proteins manipulate the cellular environment to promote proliferation and inhibit apoptosis. Much of this cellular reprogramming is enabled by the high-risk HPV E6 and E7 oncoproteins. High-risk HPV E7 bind and degrade the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor (RB1) to promote S- phase specific gene expression, thus driving proliferation and enabling viral genome replication. RB1 degradation is necessary, but not sufficient, for the oncogenic activity of high-risk HPV E7. Consequently, researchers have long sought to identify additional transforming activities of high-risk HPV E7. One candidate to account for this cooperative transforming activity is the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPN14. PTPN14 is a putative tumor suppressor that is targeted for proteasome-mediated degradation by high-risk HPV E7 but not low-risk HPV E7. It inhibits the transcriptional co-regulator YAP1. We recently discovered that PTPN14 potently promotes epithelial differentiation. HPV E7 proteins inhibit differentiation and preliminary data suggests that this correlates with oncogenic activity and with PTPN14 degradation. This proposal tests the hypothesis that high-risk HPV E7 degrade PTPN14 to activate YAP1 and impair epithelial differentiation. The goal of the work is to integrate PTPN14 degradation into an updated model of oncogenic transformation by high-risk HPV. The aims are 1) to define the contribution of E7-mediated PTPN14 degradation to transformation and differentiation and 2) to determine the mechanism by which PTPN14 degradation represses differentiation. The current understanding of oncogenic transformation by HPV E6/E7 has not identified transforming activities that cooperate with RB1 inactivation nor does it explain how high-risk HPV oncoproteins impair differentiation. Our work will address both questions and we anticipate that it will define an additional activity required for HPV- mediated transformation. Because there are no antivirals available to treat existing HPV infections, identifying any new essential step in HPV-mediated transformation could have therapeutic potential. The ability to inhibit YAP1 and/or restore differentiation in HPV-positive cancers is especially promising. Understanding the mechanisms by which high-risk HPV inhibit differentiation will, in the long term, enable new therapeutic approaches in HPV-positive cancers and premalignant lesions."
10815000,"Atherosclerotic vascular disease is a leading cause of death and disability in the United States and around
the world. Despite the advances in cardiovascular drug development, and percutaneous and surgical invasive
procedures, cardiac and cerebral vascular diseases remain a major health challenge and growing global
concern. Advanced atherosclerotic plaque or atheroma (ATH), in the intimal layer of arteries, cause most
acute myocardial infarctions and ischemic strokes, life-threatening emergencies with enormous human and
economic burden. Minority populations with socioeconomic disadvantages are highly vulnerable to a
disproportionate burden of atherosclerotic vascular disease. The cardiovascular health disparities are
associated with regional variations in exposure to risk factors for ATH, including diabetes, obesity, and
cigarette smoking. Arteries with ATH involve heightened levels of inflammation, thrombogenesis, cellular
death, and extracellular matrix degeneration, which contribute to the vulnerability to disruption. In the current
pharmaceutical armamentarium, few single therapeutics have demonstrated ability to repair of vulnerable
ATH. The unmet pathogenic problem is the dysfunction or loss of vascular cells, resulting in an increased
vulnerability of ATH arterial wall to disruption and thrombosis. Vascular Stem Cells (VSC) give rise to new
vascular cells that replace old, dead, or injured cells, and may thereby repair ATH-damaged arterial wall.
Endogenous VSC are rare, and often become dysfunctional when exposed to proatherogenic risk factors.
Moreover, administration of VSC is less effective, due to mechanical stress and the endothelial barrier that
blocks stem cells from entering ATH lesions. Little information is available concerning the vascular stem cell
quantity and quality in peripheral blood of minority patients as few preclinical or clinical studies of VSC have
been performed in minority patients with advanced vulnerable ATH. This research team has recently
constructed and tested several prototypes of echogenic immunoliposomes (ELIP) directed against surface
markers of VSC and inflammatory ATH for targeted VSC delivery to ATH. Evidence from in vitro and in vivo
pilot experiments shows the success of manufacturing dual functional, echogenic immunoliposomes (DF-
ELIP) that recognize and bridge VSC to ATH. DF-ELIP-harboring VSC can therefore promote repair of the
arterial wall injured by ATH. The project scope and product of the current SBIR phase I proposal is to conduct
a proof-concept study of DF-ELIP targeted VSC (dfVSC) for treating diseased arteries harboring ATH. Several
prototypes of dfVSC from minority donors will be prepared or formulated as a cellular therapeutic agent
selectively targeting the inflammatory, vulnerable, and rupture-prone ATH. In principle, DF-ELIP and dfVSC
will be manufactured in a good laboratory practice facility with the standard operating procedure. Their

Adverse safety events (ASEs) resulting from medical care are a leading cause of preventable injury and death
in the United States. The National Academy of Medicine recommends that hospital and Emergency Medical
Services (EMS) systems “implement evidence-based approaches to reduce errors in emergency and trauma
care for children,” but acknowledges that implementation is limited by the “paucity of high-quality data on the
epidemiology of medical errors in children, particularly within the emergency care system.” Our research team
developed and validated an EMS chart review tool to identify ASEs in the care of children and has begun to
describe the epidemiology of these events. We have identified pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA)
as a particularly high-risk condition for ASEs and poor survival. EMS plays a critical role in the health and
outcomes of Americans during cardiac arrests. Receipt of effective treatment in the first few minutes of cardiac
arrest can double or triple survival. However, while survival from adult OHCAs and in-hospital pediatric OHCAs
have both increased significantly over the last 10-15 years, survival from pediatric OHCA remains largely
unchanged. We focus on identifying preventable ASEs occurring over the entire episode of OHCA, recognized
to be a major contributor to mortality and morbidity. The status quo, manual chart reviews, considered the gold
standard for evaluating safety and quality of care, are costly and labor-intensive. The main goal of this proposal
is to computationally detect ASEs associated with pediatric OHCA at a population level from electronic EMS
charts through the following Study Aims: Aim 1. Identify adverse safety events in the prehospital care of
children with OHCA via rules- and regression-based computational processing of structured data in pediatric
EMS charts. Aim 2. Extract cardiac arrest-related indicators from EMS chart narrative text using deep learning
NLP techniques and weak supervision techniques to augment the rules-and regression--based automatic
screening of EMS charts. Aim 3. Prospectively demonstrate the scalability of automated detection of ASEs in
OHCA at the scale of statewide populations. This proposal leverages the strengths of an experienced
multidisciplinary research team that includes informaticians and clinician-scientists with expertise in pediatric
patient safety and American Heart Association Guideline development. Successful completion of the project
aims will create the foundational elements of an automated tool capable of screening EMS charts on a large
scale to identify, monitor, and ultimately mitigate preventable pediatric prehospital patient safety events.
Additionally, the computational tools and annotated dataset created in the course of this project will serve as
valuable infrastructure to support future clinical and computational research."
10929531,"Project Summary
 Over the past 15 years, suicide rates among adolescents have increased ~60%. Recently, problematic
social media use has been linked to the emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB), perhaps reflecting
greater interpersonal stress exposure. Understanding the type, timing, and severity of interpersonal stress
exposure is critical to understand STB risk, which requires carefully characterizing exposures present in their
digital lives through a deep interrogation of real-time interactions within social media. In line with the Stress
Generation Framework, adolescents experiencing psychiatric disorders possess characteristics that increase
the occurrence of interpersonal stress, which may include negative social media exposures. Accordingly, this
project will identify social neural susceptibilities that may increase the occurrence of negative social media
exposures and examine physiological processes that are impacted by negative social media exposures over
time. Our study will include adolescents ages 14-17 (N=300), which will be oversampled for youth at high risk
for suicide (n=200), defined as STB in the past 3 months and/or a past-year suicide attempt. Additionally, we will
recruit adolescents with psychiatric disorders but without a lifetime history of STB (n=100), providing an
opportunity to identify biological markers and temporally refined social media exposures that characterize risk
for STB as opposed to identifying risk factors that associate with psychiatric disorders more broadly.
Comprehensive clinical assessments will be completed at baseline, and additionally, we will probe past-year
user-generated content to assess dynamic changes in negative exposures to characterize core interpersonal
processes across social media platforms, including: (a) online victimization (e.g., harassment, hate speech), (b)
reduced social capital (e.g., reduced social network size), and (c) reduced social support (e.g., reduced
engagement, reciprocity of messaging). We also will collect baseline fMRI neural responses characterizing social
processes and assess chronic HPA axis activity. At the 2-, 4-, and 6-month follow-up assessments, interviews,
social media data, HPA axis activity, and self-reports will be re-assessed. The overarching goals is to examine
the relationship between biological processes and social media exposures, particularly with regards to
elucidating suicide risk. First, we will test whether social neural network alterations increase susceptibility to
negative social media exposures. Second, we will test whether negative social media exposures negatively
impact HPA axis activity. Last, we will test whether negative social media exposures, social neural alterations,
HPA axis activity, and their interactions lead to the emergence of suicide events (i.e., actual, interrupted, or
aborted attempts; active suicidal ideation with method, intent, or plan; emergency department visits or psychiatric
hospitalizations for STB). Through this comprehensive approach, we will address a critical public health initiative
by identifying those who are susceptible to negative social media exposures, and providing actionable markers
to reduce the needless loss of life among young people."
10815132,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Errors in the administration of children’s medication at home is a significant health problem which
disproportionately affects individuals with low health literacy and limited English proficiency. As a result, multiple
NIH-designated health disparities populations, including lower socioeconomic status (SES) and minority
populations, have a higher incidence of children’s medication errors, which result in poor symptom control, risk
of overdose, higher emergency department utilization, and hospitalization. Differences in child health can have
a cumulative life-course effect contributing to further inequities in adulthood. Health literacy is a modifiable risk
factor which has been shown to improve through digital health tools, including demonstrating a positive effect on
child health outcomes through improved parental health literacy. As such, efforts to reduce health disparities in
childhood can have a positive effect in adulthood. Pedia-Dose is developing a novel smart phone application
that uses a combination of photo image recognition and a custom dosing calculator to instantly calculate an
individual child’s over-the-counter (OTC) medication dose. In this Phase I proposal, we plan to use this proof of
concept mobile app as the framework for a redesigned Pedia-Dose App targeting root causes of home
medication errors to improve health literacy, expand access to high quality health information, and reduce
children’s medication errors through the following aims: (1) Implement evidence-based digital innovations
targeting root causes of medication errors to improve health literacy and expand access to health information for
NIH-designated health disparities populations. (2.1) Conduct a simulated usability study comparing the Pedia-
Dose App with traditional dosing tools in a diverse user population to validate this novel approach. (2.2) User
feedback will be incorporated into a redesigned mobile app that is intuitive and culturally sensitive. (3) Work with
an established regulatory consultant to prepare a pre-submission application to the FDA in preparation for a
510k application for regulatory approval as a mobile medical device. The Pedia-Dose Team has the backing of
a wide range of institutional, regulatory, software development, and business partners to successfully complete
this Phase I proposal. Successful development and validation of this novel approach providing real-time
children’s medication dosing information at home has the potential to fundamentally change how parents and
caregivers obtain information about children’s medication. By targeting root causes of medication errors to
improve health literacy and expand access to high quality medical information, this project has the potential to
positively impact the trajectory of an individual’s health throughout life, most notable for NIH-designated health
disparities populations."

 Preterm birth is an important risk factor for perinatal mortality and adverse health consequences in
childhood and adulthood. In the United States, approximately 10% of all live births were preterm (<37 weeks
gestation) in 2012 and it continues to climb. Fresno County, in the San Joaquin Valley of California, is an area
of known high air pollution burden and a high prevalence of preterm birth (12%).
 Wildfires are a significant and increasing source of air pollution in California (CA) that threaten to reverse
the progress made over the past decades in air pollution reduction and their effects on pregnant women are
not well understood. Furthermore, recent fires are occurring at the wildfire urban interface leading to biomass
and structure burning. With increased exposure to wildfire smoke comes increasing concern of health effects of
these exposures to inform future regulation. Other biomass burning sources are agricultural waste burning,
prescribed burns, and residential wood burning which all can increase air pollution exposure but in more
controlled settings and are generally performed during seasons outside the growing fire season. They differ in
scope, temperature and chemical composition and may have less severe health effects compared to wildfires.
 We and other investigators have demonstrated preterm birth risk is sensitive to prenatal exposures to
ambient air pollution, including criteria pollutants such as particulate matter and polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons, a product of incomplete combustion. Moreover, we have found stronger associations in
neighborhoods with lower socioeconomic status. This double jeopardy of exposure to pollutants and poverty is
hypothesized to contribute to disparities in preterm birth, but sufficient data are often lacking.
 To address the contribution of wildfire and other biomass burning smoke exposures on preterm birth, and
how these relationships may be modified by neighborhood deprivation, we propose to compile a unique group
of datasets of fire occurrence, air quality monitoring and modelling, and birth record data for CA (2008-2016) to
evaluate the effects of wildfires and intentional burning (agricultural waste, residential wood, and prescribed
burns) exposure on preterm birth and to evaluate if the effects differ by the Index of Concentration at the
Extreme, a measure of neighborhood deprivation that accounts for extremes based on race/ethnicity and
income by census tract. We will compare different models of fire exposure assessment and examine critical
periods of pregnancy with regard to preterm birth, while controlling for season.
 This study will provide estimates of the impact of air pollution exposures from wildfires and other biomass
burning on preterm birth. The findings have the potential to inform fire prevention and protection regulation for
wildfires, agricultural waste burning, prescribed burns, and residential wood burning."
10821406,"Project Summary/Abstract
Prostate cancer arises as an androgen driven disease, and systemic therapies that target the
androgen receptor (AR) are used to treat patients at all stages of the disease. In recent years, with
the earlier and more potent targeting of the AR with newer drugs, AR-independent prostate cancer
has emerged. We have found that this is associated with lineage plasticity in which upon selective
therapeutic pressure, tumors evade AR-therapy through loss of luminal prostate identity (including
AR) and the acquisition of alternative lineage programs including neuronal/neuroendocrine, stem-like,
and developmental pathways. In extreme cases, tumors may completely transition from an AR-
positive prostate adenocarcinoma (PADC) toward an AR-negative small cell/neuroendocrine
carcinoma (NEPC). This phenotypic change is associated with clinical and molecular features similar
to small cell lung cancer, manifest by rapid progression and lethal disease. We have integrated
patient and preclinical data to identify and molecularly characterize genes and pathways that drive
lineage plasticity including the combined loss of TP53/RB1, suppression of the Notch signaling
pathway, and up-regulation of lineage-determining transcription factors (LDTFs) including ASCL1 and
INSM1. We hypothesize that loss of Notch signaling activates LDTFs, which act coordinately with
super-enhancers and chromatin regulators to drive lineage plasticity, loss of AR signaling
dependence, and NEPC progression. To test this hypothesis, we will investigate the role of NOTCH-
INSM1 signaling in regulating LDTFs to drive NEPC progression and treatment resistance (Aim 1);
extensively characterize the super-enhancer landscape and transcriptional reprogramming that
governs lineage plasticity (Aim 2); and elucidate the transcriptional network of LDTFs that promote
tumor evolution from an AR-driven state towards non-AR driven disease (Aim 3). This proposal will
not only enhance our understanding of tumor evolution and cell identity, but will also identify new
therapeutic approaches to target lineage plasticity. These are critical steps towards improving the
early detection, treatment, and mortality of prostate cancer patients developing treatment resistance.
Results may also have relevance in other cancer types that develop lineage plasticity to evade
effective targeted therapies, such as lung cancer, melanoma, and breast cancer."
10927417,"Abstract:
The overall goal of this application is to develop a NOTCH blocking strategy in combination with oHSV that can
be safely delivered to intracranial GBM to enhance therapeutic efficacy without neurologic toxicity. In the normal
brain, Notch signaling plays a significant role in memory processing and adult neurogenesis. In glioblastoma
(GBM) NOTCH signaling has also been implicated in the development of resistance to chemotherapy and
radiation, and contributes to the dismal survival associated with GBM, a disease associated with a less than 2
year median survival despite treatment with surgery, radiation, temozolomide, and with tumor treating field
device. The overall goal of this application is to understand the impact of specific NOTCH ligand mediated
NOTCH activation on oHSV therapy for brain tumors. Since NOTCH signaling plays a significant role in the brain
in memory processing and adult neurogenesis, we will also evaluate the impact of blocking specific ligands on
memory development and safety for intracranial usage.
In our preliminary results we have identified that oHSV infection induces NOTCH activation in tumor and tumor
associated macrophages (TAM). NOTCH activation of TAMs results in induction of CCL2 that recruits monocytic
MDSCs to infected tumors. While oHSV treatment awakens anti-tumor efficacy, these monocytic MDSCs limit
the immunotherapeutic benefit by educating an immune-suppressive environment in tumors.
It has been shown that different NOTCH ligands have different effects on anti-tumor immunity. For example,
DLL1-mediated NOTCH activation is important for T cell maturation into memory cells and its overexpression
augments T cell activity and anti-tumor immunity. While JAG1, and to a lesser extent JAG2, induce PD-1 and
suppress T cell immunity. Thus, we hypothesize that blockade of JAG1 mediated signaling should enhance
virotherapy induced anti-tumor immunity, and its transient expression by an oHSV would not create a neurologic
memory deficit in mice. Since, membrane bound ligands can activate NOTCH signaling and soluble monomeric
ligands can inhibit NOTCH signaling, here we will test the effect of blocking individual NOTCH ligand mediated
NOTCH activation on oHSV efficacy and anti-tumor immunity (Aim 1). In aim 2 we will create an oHSV that can
effectively block virus induced ligand specific NOTCH signaling to augment virus induced anti-tumor immunity.
This virus will also be evaluated for safety, sensitivity to ACV, and effect on mouse behavior and memory. Further
we have found that combination of an oHSV with irradiation synergistically activates NOTCH signaling. In aim 3
we will evaluate the effect of this virus in combination with irradiation."

Permanent supportive housing (PSH), the gold standard intervention for ending chronic homelessness, has
expanded rapidly across the U.S. in recent years and is likely to continue expanding as homelessness
increases in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to a confluence of individual and environmental risk
factors, PSH tenants face heightened risk for overdose (OD). While evidence-based practices (EBPs) to
prevent OD exist, they have not been broadly implemented in PSH settings. We propose to address this
significant research to practice gap by tailoring a set of evidence-based OD prevention practices for PSH
settings, then studying their implementation in 20 PSH buildings in New York. We will test a package of
implementation strategies that includes an implementation toolkit, tenant-staff implementation champion dyads,
limited practice facilitation, and learning collaboratives. The project will be conducted in partnership with the
Corporation for Supportive Housing, a national organization that advances solutions to improve PSH through
education, practice, and policy. Aim 1 is to adapt evidence-based OD prevention practices for PSH, using key
stakeholder focus groups, and develop a PSH OD Prevention Toolkit to guide implementation. In this
preparation phase we will adapt an existing package of EBPs in consideration of the unique environmental
characteristics of PSH and will prepare for implementation. Aim 2 is to evaluate implementation of evidence-
based OD prevention practices across diverse PSH buildings and effectiveness on PSH tenant outcomes in a
stepped wedge trial. In this Hybrid Type 3 effectiveness-implementation study, the primary implementation
outcome is PSH building adoption of the OD prevention EBPs. We will additionally examine secondary
implementation outcomes, tenant clinical outcomes, and implementation sustainment. Aim 3 is to explore
multilevel factors influencing implementation—including barriers and facilitators—and refine dissemination and
implementation frameworks for housing settings, using qualitative interviews with PSH staff. The research
draws from the EPIS (Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment) implementation framework and
Rhodes’ Risk Environment Framework. The research will inform implementation frameworks and strategies by
examining application of EPIS for PSH and testing novel housing-relevant implementation strategies including
staff-tenant implementation champion dyads. Findings from this PSH-focused research are expected to be
more broadly applicable to other types of housing and settings serving people experiencing homelessness.
The multidisciplinary investigator team will work with a Stakeholder Advisory Board to maximize impact of the
research, which has been designed to inform local and national programmatic and policy interventions.
Changes in the epidemiology of the U.S. OD crisis highlight the need for concerted efforts to reduce the
disparate burden of ODs faced by particularly marginalized populations."

Exposure to trauma when young, or as and adult, enhances one's risk for a variety of stress-associated
disorders, such as anxiety/depression and/or PTSD (A/D or P). These stressors also put one's offspring at risk
for a variety of psychological disorders. The majority of this effect is likely due to trauma-associated alterations
in the interactions of parents with children, but a growing body of evidence in mice suggests that at least some
of this effect may be due to epigenetic inheritance of the effect of trauma, mediated by stress-induced changes
in the levels of specific sperm micro-RNAs (miRNAs) that influence zygote development after fertilization. Our
recent publications that drive this proposal raise the possibility that this concept applies to humans. We
showed that exposure of adolescent male mice to chronic social instability (CSI) stress elevates anxiety
specifically in their female offspring across at least three generations, even if offspring are never exposed to
their fathers. We implicated two highly related and coordinately expressed sperm miRNAs, miR-34c and miR-
449a (miRs-34c/449a) in this process. In particular, we detected large decreases in both of their levels in
sperm of F0 CSI stressed male mice, early F1 embryos derived from them, and sperm of F1 male offspring
that transmit these stress phenotypes specifically to their F2 female offspring. We also found a negative
correlation between the levels of the same sperm miRNAs and the degree of exposure of men to abusive
and/or dysfunctional family experiences, revealed by the Adverse Childhood Experience (ACE) questionnaire.
These miRNAs contribute to fertility in humans and sperm and brain development in mice. That both miRNAs
are reduced in sperm of stressed mice and men is of particular significance because their redundant functions
require that both be suppressed in knockout mice to observe these phenotypes. Thus, Aim1 will expand our
recent study by testing whether adult exposure to trauma, assessed by the Trauma History Questionnaire
(THQ), also reduces the levels of these sperm miRNAs. This aim will also test whether, just as in mice, stress-
induced changes in men's sperm miRNAs are transmitted to their sons, which could lead to transmission of
traits across multiple generations. Aim 2 will test whether reduced levels of sperm miRs-34c/449a, like
elevated ACE scores, could be associated with the degree of men's experiences with A/D or P. We will also
test whether transmission of reduced levels of these miRNAs is associated with A/D or P in offspring. Since our
mouse model leads to anxiety only in female offspring, we will also test sisters of men expressing low levels of
sperm miR-34c/449a “inherited” from their stressed fathers for these maladies. Overall, this proposal's
findings may suggest that the levels of sperm miRNA levels can be markers for men's past experiences with
abuse as well as their, or their sisters', recent experiences with A/D or P. They may also add support for the
idea that transgenerational epigenetic inheritance of the effects of trauma occurs in humans.

BCR affinity drives selection of mutations that increase potency and breadth in serum antibody (Ab), but also
predisposes the fate choices of GC B cells towards terminal PC differentiation. We will study the role of BCR
affinity in determining the fates of B cells exposed to serial immunizations or chronic SHIV infection to optimize
vaccine efficacy. Parallel studies carried out in knock-in mice expressing the germline ancestor (UCA) of a V3
glycan bNAb lineage and in rhesus macaques (RMs) will merge lineage tracing of GC B and T cells with high
throughput transcriptional analysis of individual lymphocytes to determine how and what immunological
environments maximize the probability of eliciting broadly neutralizing antibody (bNAb) responses. We will use
engineered Env vaccine antigens (Ags) to optimize the return of Bmem to secondary and tertiary GCs in BCR
KI mice, and to determine how BCR affinity affects differentiation to the GC, Bmem and PC compartments. In
SHIV infected RMs, we will in parallel map BCR affinities associated with nascent bNAb production and
determine the effects of prior immunization with selected Env vaccines on subsequent, homologous or
heterologous infection."
10808995,"PROJECT SUMMARY
We have demonstrated recent success in designing immunogens that can bind HIV broadly neutralizing
antibodies (bNAb) precursors with high affinity, expand these B cells in immunized animals, and select for key
somatic hypermutations essential for the development of neutralization breadth. Although promising, the
progress has been limited to just the first steps along long and complex evolutionary pathways as bNAbs typically
have extensive numbers of somatic hypermutation. While only a subset of these mutations is necessary for
acquisition of breadth, it is unclear which mutations represent shared features of Env recognition between
different bNAb lineages that can be targeted with immunogens. Identifying the common maturational events in
bNAb development shared by multiple lineages that target the same bNAb epitope is of critical importance for
vaccine design strategies that target a diverse pool of bNAb precursors. Once lineages from diverse starting
points are engaged and expanded with priming immunogens, boosting immunogens will need to direct their
maturation to acquire the components of broad recognition. The identification of shared recognition features is
only possible by comparing a large set of bNAb lineages that target the same epitope. Through our current
HIVRAD, we have shown one source of primate bNAb B cell lineages for immunogen design can be SHIV-
infected rhesus macaques (RMs). We have demonstrated that one in six RMs infected by SHIVs have gone on
to generate bNAb responses. Over one third of these responses have been targeted to the V3-glycan epitope,
the most common site targeted by bNAbs in human infection. Structural determination of a V3 glycan bNAb
isolated from a SHIV infected RM revealed striking similarities to a human V3 glycan bNAb indicating remarkable
convergent evolution of V3 glycan epitope recognition. Thus, we now have a system for reliably inducing V3
glycan bNAbs that can inform the design of immunogens that elicit bNAbs targeting the V3 glycan epitope. The
central hypothesis of Project 3 is that commonalities exist in how bNAb lineages recognize the V3 glycan
epitope, and that immunogens can be designed to select for these shared recognition features which when
combined in a sequential immunization regimen will elicit bNAbs. In Aim 1, we will identify the common
mechanisms of V3 glycan epitope recognition shared between SHIV and human infection-induced V3 glycan
bNAbs to define templates for immunogen design using B cell lineage tracing and a rapid structural
determination. In Aim 2, we will design immunogens that can prime multiple V3 glycan lineages in rhesus and
humans using a novel design goal of selecting first for B cells with long CDRH3s. In Aim 3, we will use viral
sequencing of SHIV infected monkeys as a source for Env library variants in mammalian cell surface display to
design boosting immunogens that select for shared maturational events in V3 glycan bNAb recognition. Project
3 will impact the field by generating prime and boosting immunogens, tested in RMs, that will lead to vaccine
candidates capable of eliciting bNAbs in humans."

The long-term goal of this project is to understand the functions of selective autophagy in corneal inflammation
as well as corneal/limbal epithelial differentiation. Selective autophagy is a specialized form of autophagy and
can control signaling pathways in cells by specifically degrading key components of these pathways. Even
though our studies have advanced our understanding on the roles of non selective autophagy in corneal/limbal
epithelia, the roles of selective autophagy in corneal inflammation and corneal/limbal epithelial differentiation
remain unclear. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) methodologies enable the interrogation of relatively
rare cell populations (e.g., stem and early transit amplifying (TA) cells). This technology also allows the
comparison of different physiological and/or disease states. Thus, we took advantage of Beclin1+/- (Beclin1 het)
mice, a well-established mouse model with compromised autophagy and conducted a scRNA-seq analysis in
the ocular anterior segmental tissue from wild-type (WT) and beclin1 het mice. scRNA-seq data suggest that
autophagy plays a significant role in response to corneal inflammation, epithelial differentiation, and the
regulation of Notch signaling. Our preliminary data show that genetic attenuation of autophagy enhances
corneal inflammation. Interestingly, TRAF2, a positive regulator of inflammation, is regulated by NDP52-
mediated selective autophagy. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that attenuation of p62-mediated selective
autophagy markedly increased: (i) stem/TA cell enriched human limbal epithelial cell (HLEC) differentiation;
and (ii) Notch intracellular domain (Notch ICD, an active form of Notch) in HLECs in a proteosome independent
way. The scRNA-seq data also suggested that Wdfy1, which is preferentially expressed in the mouse limbal
epithelial basal layer, was positively regulated by autophagy. Knockdown of Wdfy1 enhanced HLEC
differentiation. Therefore, we will question if: (i) NDP52-mediated selective autophagy degrades TRAF2 and
consequently has an inhibitory role in the inflammatory response in both corneal epithelial cells and
macrophages (Aim1); and (ii) downregulation of p62-mediated selective autophagy allows for limbal epithelial
differentiation via increasing Notch ICD (active form) and thus decreasing Wdfy1 expression (Aim2). To
accomplish these goals, we will capitalize on our ability to conduct gain- and loss-of-function studies of
selective autophagy-related genes in submerged and 3D organotypic raft cultures of primary limbal/corneal
epithelial cells as well as mice. Knowledge gained from this study will provide molecular insights into how
selective autophagy regulates corneal inflammation and limbal epithelial differentiation. A better understanding
of the physiological importance of selective autophagy in corneal inflammation and differentiation will translate
into the development of novel therapies by targeting selective autophagy pathways for corneal diseases in
which extensive inflammation and aberrant differentiation are features (e.g., chemical burns)."
10805356,"Neurexins are presynaptic adhesion molecules that perform central functions in regulating synapse properties.
Neurexins control properties of synapses as diverse as the presynaptic release probability, the postsynaptic
receptor composition, trans-synaptic endocannabinoid signaling, and synapse numbers. Puzzlingly, the
functions of neurexins differ among synapses and depend on the identity of the pre- and postsynaptic neurons.
Moreover, mutations of neurexin genes, especially NRXN1, are among the most important single-gene risk
factors for schizophrenia, autism, and Tourette syndrome. Hundreds of recent studies have examined the
biological role of neurexins, but their function in shaping synapses remains unclear. For example, it is still
unknown what range of functions neurexins perform, how neurexins perform these functions, and why
mutations in neurexin genes predispose to neuropsychiatric disorders. Addressing these questions is essential
for insight into how synaptic circuits operate and is the goal of the current grant application. Extracellularly,
neurexins interact with more than 30 ligands to form trans-synaptic adhesion complexes. These ligands include
key regulators of synapses such as neuroligins, cerebellins, and LRRTMs. By binding to these ligands,
neurexins form a molecular network of interactions that is activity-dependent and that likely mediates their
diverse functions. Neurexins are diversified into thousands of isoforms by alternative splicing that is, at least in
part, also activity-dependent and regulates the ligand-binding affinity of neurexins. Given the central role of
neurexins in shaping synapses, the present application thus aims to test the overarching hypothesis that
neurexins are master regulators of synapse properties that control synaptic information processing and circuit
input/output relationships in an activity-dependent manner by binding to diverse ligands. In four specific aims,
the application proposes experiments that will investigate the overall functions of all neurexin genes, study the
role of selected interactions of neurexins with key ligands, examine the regulation and functional significance of
the extensive alternative splicing of neurexins, and test the mechanisms of regulation of neurexins by post-translational modifications. These experiments will systematically characterize neurexin functions in three brain
areas, the hippocampus, olfactory bulb, and medial nucleus of the trapezoid body in the brainstem, using
mutant mice as a model system. The experiments will adopt a multidisciplinary approach that combines optical
imaging with protein chemistry and electrophysiology to explore the full functions of neurexins. They will aim to
reveal the scope and mechanisms of neurexin functions and to characterize the implications of these functions
for synaptic circuits. Among others, these experiments will contribute to our understanding of how a synapse’s
properties are shaped dynamically by neurexins in an activity-dependent manner that determines the
input/output relations of the neural circuits in which this synapse resides, and will add to our understanding of
how neurexin mutations predispose to neuropsychiatric disorders."

Arboviruses cause serious human disease. Viremia level following arbovirus infection of vertebrates is a critical
determinant of viral transmission cycles, global viral spread, and disease severity in individuals. Surprisingly, the
factors that dictate viremia following arbovirus infection are poorly defined. We found that multiple arboviruses,
including chikungunya (CHIKV), Ross River (RRV), o’nyong nyong (ONNV) and Zika viruses, are cleared from
the circulation by phagocytic cells. Experiments in splenectomized mice showed that the spleen is dispensable
for arboviral clearance. Instead, virus accumulates in the liver and clearance is independent of natural antibodies
and complement factors, suggesting a non-opsonic mechanism. Consistent with this idea, clearance of
circulating alphaviruses was blocked by competitive inhibitors of scavenger receptors (SRs) that mediate non-
opsonic uptake of non-self and modified-self ligands. Remarkably, we found that single lysine (K) to arginine (R)
mutations in the E2 glycoproteins of CHIKV and ONNV (E2 K200R), as well as RRV (E2 K251R), abrogated
clearance of circulating alphavirus particles by phagocytic cells, and promoted rapid viral dissemination to distal
tissues. Moreover, substitution of CHIKV E2 K200 with a variety of other amino acids also allows for clearance
evasion, suggesting a specific interaction between key K residues and a host factor. Ks are targets for post-
translational modification (PTM), and mass spectrometry analysis of E2 in virions revealed that CHIKV E2 K200
is ubiquitinated. These experiments have revealed a previously unrecognized pathway that controls arbovirus
viremia and dissemination in vertebrates. We hypothesize that PTM of key Ks in viral glycoproteins licenses the
capture of circulating arboviruses via SRs expressed on liver Kupffer cells (KCs). In Specific Aim 1, the cell
types that capture circulating arboviruses will be defined. We also will determine the role of KCs in viral clearance
and dissemination, and the development of anti-viral immunity. Finally, we will evaluate the role of phagocytic
cells, and KCs specifically, in the clearance of a genera-spanning panel of arboviruses. In Specific Aim 2, we
will define the spectrum of blood-borne arboviruses susceptible to SR-mediated clearance. We will use ELISA
and cellular binding assays to determine the murine and human SR(s) that bind virus particles. Using SR
knockout mice, we will determine the role of specific SRs in clearance of circulating arboviruses. In Specific Aim
3, we will define the role of E2 ubiquitination in the clearance of circulating CHIKV and RRV. We will use mass
spectrometry-based proteomics to determine K residues in arboviral particles that are modified with ubiquitin or
other PTMs. Finally, we will use a collection of reverse genetics systems to define the role of specific modified
Ks in arboviral clearance from the circulation. This work will provide new mechanistic understanding of arbovirus
clearance from the circulation. Elucidating these mechanisms could provide new insight into viral transmission,
dissemination, and pathogenesis, identify new risk factors of severe disease, and reveal new therapeutic targets
for the treatment of arboviral disease."

ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels couple cell metabolism to membrane excitability and are critical for many
physiological functions. They are unique membrane protein complexes formed by four inwardly rectifying K+
channel (Kir6.1 or Kir6.2) subunits and four sulfonylurea receptor (SUR1 or SUR2) subunits. This grant is focused
on KATP channels consisting of Kir6.2 and SUR1, which have a key role in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in
pancreatic β-cells. Loss-of-function mutations in these channels cause congenital hyperinsulinism and
hypoglycemia, whereas gain-of-function mutations cause neonatal diabetes and in severe cases DEND
(Developmental delay, Epilepsy, and Neonatal Diabetes) syndrome. In addition, KATP gene polymorphisms
increase risk for type 2 diabetes. Our long-term goal is to understand the structure-function relationship of
KATP channels in order to develop mechanism-based therapies for disease caused by KATP dysfunction.
Over the past three funding cycles, we have made significant progress towards this goal. Most particularly,
using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) we recently obtained high-resolution structures of the
channel bound with the physiological inhibitor ATP and the anti-diabetic drug glibenclamide (glyburide). This
opened a new chapter for the field, enabling us to understand the structural basis of KATP channel assembly and
gating in health and disease, at near atomic detail and in the context of full channel structure. Our group is
uniquely positioned to help lead this effort by integrating our cryoEM capability with the extensive molecular,
biochemical, and biophysical tools and knowledge we have amassed over the course of this grant. In this renewal
application, we propose to tackle the most important yet challenging problems remaining in the field. Our
overarching hypothesis is that SUR1 assembles with and regulates the function of Kir6.2 through specific
structural interactions that are regulated by physiological and pharmacological ligands. We will use a
combination of structural, molecular dynamics simulation and functional approaches to test the hypothesis in
three interwoven but independent Specific Aims. (1) Elucidate KATP channel assembly mechanisms guided by
our cryoEM structures. (2) Identify and monitor interactions between SUR1, Kir6.2, and ligands that are critical for
channel opening and closure to understand the structural mechanisms governing channel gating. (3) Determine
open state structures of KATP channels by cryoEM to understand the conformational transition during gating. The
proposal has a strong scientific premise built on our rigorous preliminary and published studies as well as a
careful review of the literature. The proposal is innovative as it will generate new structures and test conceptually
novel mechanistic hypotheses on channel gating and assembly emanated from the recent cryoEM structures.
Successful outcome will have significant impact on advancing our structural knowledge of channel regulation to
facilitate mechanistic drug design for disease caused by KATP channel dysfunction. Further, the outcome will have
broad implications for many other ABC transporters and ion channels important for human health."

Title: Role of the gut metabolite lactate on Campylobacter jejuni pathogenicity:
Campylobacter jejuni is a leading global source of human gastroenteritis caused by bacteria.
According to the most recent CDC FoodNet Surveillance System data, the incidence rate of
infection by Campylobacter was 17.8 cases per 100,000 population in United State. Due to
emergence of multidrug resistant strains, we need alternative therapeutic approaches to decrease
disease burden. This will require a better understanding of C. jejuni infection dynamics.
Progression of gastroenteritis mediated by microaerobic C. jejuni is poorly understood, especially
regarding its population expansion during the inflammatory stage of infection. Lack of a natural
disease model has limited our ability to study mechanisms of C. jejuni-mediated disease
progression in vivo. Our preliminary data demonstrate that young ferrets develop moderate to
acute gastroenteritis symptoms after infection with C. jejuni, which mimics human infection. We
also observed significant population expansion of colonic C. jejuni co-incident with an
inflammatory response in this tissue during the acute stage of infection. C. jejuni infection resulted
in colonic crypt hyperplasia, elevation of undifferentiated, proliferating Ki67+ cells in the lamina
propria, and alteration in gut metabolites compared to uninfected controls. Among elevated
metabolites was lactate, a growth substrate for C. jejuni. A strain of C. jejuni lacking the capacity
for lactate uptake was significantly less fit in this infection/inflammation model. We hypothesize
that infection by C. jejuni generates host derived lactate which contributes to pathogen expansion
in the gut lumen. Lactate also influences chemotaxis, flagellar dependent motility, and cell
adherence and invasion of C. jejuni, which are major pathogenicity traits. These findings will be
extended through the following specific aims:
Specific Aim 1: Determine the origin of elevated lactate level during C. jejuni infection.
Specific Aim 2: Define the effect of lactate on C. jejuni physiology.
By completing our two aims, we will uncover new knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of C.
jejuni infection, identifying host and bacterial factors that influence expansion of C. jejuni growth
during the inflammatory stage of infection. This work will contribute to developing therapeutic
approaches for reducing bacterial burden and disease symptoms."

This study is responsive to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) NOT-AT-21-006 “Fundamental Science
Research on Complementary and Integrative Health Approaches, Including Natural Products or Mind and Body
Interventions” objectives to “Develop targeted and untargeted bioinformatic approaches to identify active
components in a natural product mixture.”
Structural elucidation of natural products (NPs) remains a critical rate-limiting step in NP discovery campaigns.
Difficulties in structural elucidation can arise from i) the lack of sufficient quantities of material for traditional
analytical methods (e.g. nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography); ii) intrinsic
physical properties of the NP, and iii) limitations of NMR capabilities in determining relative configuration. X-ray
crystallography remains the gold-standard for unambiguous structural determination, including the assignment
of stereochemistry. However, X-ray crystallographic analysis of newly-isolated NPs is often thwarted by
insufficient quantities to provide crystals large enough for single-crystal diffraction or poor solid-state properties
that preclude the formation of large, pristine crystals even when sufficient material is available. Given these
challenges, we envision that application of the recently reported cryo-electron microscopy (CryoEM) modality
micro-crystal electron diffraction (MicroED) could lead to vertical advances in the field of NP discovery directly
responsive to this NOSI, as MicroED has recently been demonstrated to provide unambiguous structures from
sub-micron-sized crystals of structurally complex chemical compounds that had failed to yield large crystals
suitable for X-ray analysis.
In this proposal, we aim to leverage a CryoEM/MicroED approach to resolving major bottlenecks in the structure
elucidation of (partially) purified NPs and chemically complex NP mixtures. We hypothesize that we can advance
the field of NP research through development and optimization of a high-throughput platform technology to
identify NPs in complex mixtures and yield a novel diffractomics signature of molecules for integration into
bioinformatics approaches. To evaluate this hypothesis, we will carry out three specific aims: 1) Use MicroED to
solve structures of recalcitrant (partially) purified NPs; 2) Develop a high-throughput MicroED-based platform for
compound discovery; and 3) Resolve major bottlenecks in structure determination of complex NP mixtures. For
all aims, we will leverage a one-of-a-kind and expansive group of three NP collections (chemical libraries of
extracts and partially purified fractions) derived from plants, marine organisms, and filamentous fungi. We
anticipate advancement in the speed and accuracy of NP structural identification as a result of these studies,
accelerating the rate of discovery of pharmacologically relevant NPs key to the improvement of human health."
10794384,"Pregnancy is a transformative period when multiple body systems radically adjust to protect and nurture the
growing fetus. Increasingly, evidence shows that exposure to metabolism disrupting environmental chemicals
such as phthalates, can dysregulate the body’s ability to adapt appropriately to the demands of pregnancy.
Phthalates disrupt multiple nuclear receptor and hormone-mediated pathways and in cross-sectional research,
they have been linked to obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and metabolic syndrome. Our
research in multiple pregnancy cohorts demonstrates that elevated concentrations of certain phthalate
metabolites are associated with adverse cardiometabolic outcomes including excessive gestational weight gain,
gestational diabetes mellitus, and impaired glucose tolerance. In the postpartum, maternal physiology must
readjust to the non-pregnant state, a physiological “reset” that may be a second critical period of heightened
vulnerability to endocrine disruption. Dysregulation during this time is particularly important given the strong
evidence that failure to appropriately adapt to the changing demands of pregnancy and postpartum may increase
future risk of chronic disease (e.g. CVD, type 2 diabetes). The over-arching hypothesis of this research is that
pregnancy and the postpartum are sensitive windows during which phthalates may dysregulate maternal
physiology, leading to long-term cardiometabolic health risks. We propose that comprehensive characterization
of cardiometabolic health in the first four years after childbirth will provide key insights into the effects of phthalate
exposure during critical prenatal and postpartum windows. This proposal capitalizes on the infrastructure, rich
data and biospecimen repositories of two ongoing pregnancy cohort studies, UPSIDE MOMS
(UM; R01NR017602) & ERGO (R01ES026166), specifically designed to study maternal cardiometabolic health
in pregnancy and postpartum. ERGO and UM had identical eligibility criteria, recruiting women in early
pregnancy and following them through the postpartum, with extensive prenatal and postpartum bio-specimen
collection, coupled with postpartum maternal cardiometabolic assessments. In the proposed combined UM-
ERGO cohort (n=500) we capitalize on a larger sample size to measure maternal urinary phthalate
concentrations at 6 time points (1st and 3rd trimesters, 1-3 years postpartum) and examine associations with body
composition and cardiometabolic biomarkers at 1-4 years postpartum. Study aims include: (1) Determine
associations between pregnancy and postpartum phthalate concentrations and maternal body composition at 1-
4 years postpartum; 2) Examine associations between pregnancy and postpartum phthalate concentrations and
maternal cardiometabolic profiles at 1-4 years postpartum; and (3) Employ newer modeling approaches to
identify sensitive windows in which phthalates may impact maternal obesity and cardiometabolic measures. Our
study is a unique opportunity to examine phthalate exposure in pregnancy and the early postpartum in relation
to maternal health over 4 years of intensive follow-up."

Dyslexia and ADHD are prevalent neurodevelopmental disorders with a high rate of co-occurrence. Executive
function (EF) challenges are common in both disorders, but research has yet to examine whether reading is
impacted differentially by EF deficits or ADHD status. Dyslexia research is further limited by few longitudinal
neuroimaging efforts examining reading growth and predictors of change in reading over time. Examining EF in
dyslexia with ADHD and dyslexia without ADHD is an under-studied topic, despite the potential for clarifying
etiological factors underlying reading difficulty and understanding the impact on academic outcomes that rely on
reading. Scientifically, this effort is essential for disambiguating contributions of ADHD and EF to reading
performance in dyslexia and testing associated theoretical models. Practically, this information is crucial for
developing effective assessment approaches to understand reading difficulty and intervene effectively. Final
datasets will include 80 typically developing readers (TD), 80 students with dyslexia, and 80 students with
dyslexia and ADHD. Students will be recruited when they are in grade three or four (ages 8-10), and data
collection will span three annual consecutive visits. The objectives are to: (1) precisely characterize ADHD status,
EF skills, and reading skills; (2) examine behavioral and neurocognitive correlates of reading to differentiate
contributions of EF deficits from ADHD status in dyslexia; and (3) determine whether behavioral and/or
neurocognitive longitudinal reading growth for children with dyslexia differ by comorbid ADHD and/or EF deficit
status. We predict that children with dyslexia will not differ based on reading measures when comparing children
with comorbid ADHD versus dyslexia alone. We hypothesize that (1) among children with dyslexia (with and
without ADHD), EF deficits - but not ADHD diagnosis - will be associated with worse reading performance and
differences on neurocognitive indices of performance; (2) children with dyslexia who do not have EF deficits will
demonstrate more reading growth than their peers with EF deficits, regardless of ADHD status, and (3) EF
deficits will impact reading fluency but not reading accuracy performance and growth. Findings will inform us
about whether any of these factors are related to children who make substantial progress in closing their reading
gaps versus other children do not, as well as characterize the utility of EF measures/ADHD surveys in predicting
reading growth among children with dyslexia. The significance of the research extends from discovery of etiology
associated with reading difficulties to testing a theoretical model and constructing improved approaches to
assessment and intervention for struggling readers. This proposal offers the largest and longest neurocognitive
study of dyslexia to date. Most importantly, the current work offers the potential to discover whether EF or ADHD
status may prevent some students with dyslexia from closing gaps in reading performance."

10795033,"Project Summary (Abstract):
Since its establishment in 2000, the Ohio Valley Node (OVN) has been one of the most productive of NIDA's
Clinical Trials Network (CTN) nodes, both in leading and participating in multi-site trials. The OVN includes
successful partnerships with four healthcare systems, two pharmacy networks, and six addiction specialty/
infectious disease programs. These collaborating sites span a seven-state region including some of the states
most heavily impacted by opioid (Ohio, Kentucky, and West Virginia) and methamphetamine (Missouri,
Kentucky, and North Dakota) use. The OVN includes Midwestern, Appalachian, Upper South, and Native
American representation, which significantly enhances the geographical and cultural diversity of the CTN. The
OVN Research Core is the driving force of the OVN and is led by Dr. Winhusen, one of the foremost experts in
conducting multi-site addiction clinical trials in clinical practice settings. The OVN investigators have extensive
expertise in substance use disorders (Winhusen, Brown, Burlew, Lyons, Montgomery, Lofwall, Walsh) and
bioinformatics (Kaelber, Xu). The six members of the OVN research-implementation team bring > 60 years of
combined experience conducting CTN clinical trials. If funded, our overall goal would be to utilize the wealth of
experience and expertise gained over the past 19 years to conduct the research needed to address public
health care crises, including the opioid use epidemic and the alarming increase in stimulant use. To this end,
we would work with our healthcare partners to engage a diverse set of patients and service systems in areas
highly impacted by substance use in CTN research. We would also contribute our expertise in conducting
efficacy, effectiveness, and implementation trials testing the full range of interventions, from medications to
behavioral interventions and health service innovations, for both opioid and stimulant use disorders. Moreover,
we would contribute our expertise in the use of electronic health records for prospective and retrospective
research studies, including the application of artificial intelligence to large healthcare datasets. In sum, we seek
to continue providing scientific leadership, particularly on studies that could meaningfully impact clinical
practice, and to effectively collaborate with a variety of professionals including treatment providers,
investigators from diverse institutions, and staff of the Center for CTN (CCTN), clinical coordinating center
(CCC) and data and statistics center (DSC) in support of the CTN mission."
10795034,"Project Summary/Abstract
 The sensitivity and availability of omic technologies have enabled the genomic, transcriptomic
and proteomic characterization of disease phenotypes, at the tissue and even the single cell level. This has
allowed development of treatments that target specific disease subtypes, most notably in cancer
treatment, and thus opened up opportunities for the development of precision/personalized medicine
strategies for optimizing treatments for individual patients. Thus, new genomic science educational initiatives
need to be continually updated to educate the clinical and translational workforce on how to effectively
interpret and apply the findings from genomics studies. Patients of providers who have participated in these
educational initiatives also benefit as it allows for more rapid integration of genomic study findings into the
clinical care setting. Thus, in response to PAR-19-185, we propose to develop and implement the
Clinical Research Education in Genome Science (CREiGS) program that will not only focus on the
analysis of genomic data, but also on gene-expression data, the integration of these two data types, as well
as introductory theory and application of statistical and machine learning methods. Specifically we
propose to accomplish the following specific aims:
1. Develop and successfully implement the online and in-person phases of CREiGS to increase the
methodologic ingenuity by which researchers tackle important genomics-related clinical problems.
2. Establish a Diversity Recruitment External Advisory Board to ensure that the most effective strategies
are employed to recruit URM doctoral students, postdoctoral fellows, and faculty from academic institutions
nationwide into CREiGS.
3. Enhance the dissemination phase of CREiGS by packaging and uploading the asynchronous lectures
and the online critical thinking/problem solving assessments with solutions for publicly available, online
teaching resources.
4. Implement effective methods to evaluate the efficacy of CREiGS by examining:1) the participants' grasp
of the CREiGS core competencies, 2) the clarity and quality of the curriculum, 3) program logistics and
operation, and 4) the participants' short-term and long-term success attributed to participation in CREiGS.
In summary, we posit that CREiGS will provide participants with a solid foundation in genomics science to
answer complex, clinical questions. We believe that CREiGS supports the mission of the NHGRI by providing
researchers with rigorous training to “accelerate medical breakthroughs that improve human health.”"

Follow-up colonoscopy after abnormal stool-based colorectal cancer screening (e.g., fecal immunochemical test
(FIT)) results in early detection of colorectal cancer (CRC), prevention of CRC, and reduction in CRC-mortality.
FIT is a commonly utilized screening test that can be performed at home, is inexpensive, scalable, and often
adopted in health systems where colonoscopy resources are scarce. Despite evidence that timely colonoscopy
is necessary after an abnormal FIT result, completion colonoscopy occurs in less than 50% of patients at 6
months and varies significantly by clinic and health systems. In addition to understanding the meaning of an
abnormal FIT, three care transitions must occur smoothly for the patient: colonoscopy referral, scheduling, and
attendance. However, multilevel factors influence missed follow-up, and multilevel solutions are needed along
the care continuum to address clinic-, provider-, and patient-level factors that impair or delay colonoscopy
completion.
IMProving Adherence to Colonoscopy through Teams and Technology (IMPACTT), proposes to close gaps and
reduce disparities in CRC screening by improving completion of diagnostic colonoscopy following abnormal FIT
in vulnerable populations using a multilevel approach consisting of interventions at the clinic-, provider- and
patient-level. The specific aims are 1) to evaluate the effect of a clinic-level intervention targeting primary
care providers and staff to adopt “best practices” to support colonoscopy completion in patients with abnormal
FIT results, 2) to determine the effect of a patient-level technology intervention with enhanced instructions
and navigation for patients with abnormal FIT to complete a diagnostic colonoscopy, and 3) to explore the
multilevel implementation factors contributing to intervention outcomes using mixed methods.
IMPACTT is situated in a publicly-funded, urban safety-net health system that cares for diverse, low-income
patients with a high prevalence of limited health literacy and English proficiency. In order to develop solutions
that work for vulnerable patients that are at particular risk to incomplete follow-up, interventions must be
conducted in the settings that serve them. In addition, given the complexity of patient health behaviors and the
multi-step process of colonoscopy completion, scalable interventions are needed. This proposal is feasible in
this health system because 1) FIT screening is standard practice for CRC screening, 2) the system’s 12 primary
care clinics is integrated with one gastroenterology practice, and 3) primary care and specialty care share an
electronic health record and consultation system. These characteristics offer an infrastructure for implementation
and evaluation, facilitated by effective care coordination and communication. IMPACTT is positioned to develop
a multilevel intervention to improve CRC follow-up for vulnerable populations, which holds the potential to reduce
health disparities in other health systems as well as lay the foundation to address other health conditions and
behaviors."

Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) decreases mortality and both CR and pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) improve
function, quality of life, and decrease readmission rates. Despite their proven efficacy, both programs are
grossly underutilized, with fewer than 20% of eligible persons participating. Patients with heart and lung
disease living in rural communities have even lower rates of participation.
The objective of this proposal is to test the feasibility of performing a full-scale randomized controlled trial
(RCT) to compare the effectiveness and value of a stepped care (SC) model versus treatment as usual (TAU)
in older frail adults living rural counties. TAU refers to center-based rehabilitation (CBR). The SC model
includes initial enrollment into CBR followed by possible step up to three interventions based on prespecified
non-response criteria: 1) Transportation-subsidized CBR, 2) Home-based telerehabilitation (TR), and 3)
Community health worker-(CHW) supported home-based TR. Unlike traditional SC models, the initial treatment
in this model, i.e. CBR, is not the least resource intensive. CBR was chosen as the initial option because it is
currently considered the standard of care.
We will conduct a parallel, 2-arm, randomized controlled feasibility trial. Eligible participants will be randomized
to TAU (CBR) or SC. Because of the urgent need to address underuse of both CR and PR in rural regions, the
proposed feasibility trial will enroll patients referred to either CR or PR. Both arms include an in-person intake
evaluation conducted by a certified rehabilitation nurse in the rehabilitation center to determine exercise
tolerance and design a tailored 8-week rehabilitation program. Patients randomized to TAU participate in two
weekly sessions at the center and are encouraged to exercise at home in between sessions. Patients
randomized to the SC arm will also be enrolled in the CBR program. Those who meet prespecified non-
response criteria will be stepped up to transportation-subsidized CBR. Providing transportation may not be
sufficient for frail older adults who are reluctant to leave their homes in the winter, unfamiliar with exercising, or
do not want to exercise in a group setting. Thus, non-responders, will be stepped up to home-based TR.
Home-based rehabilitation will be supported by Chanl Health, a virtual platform that supports education and
self-management, remote monitoring, and coaching by rehabilitation specialists. Non-responders will be
stepped up to CHW-supported home-based TR. The CHW will be help participants use the mobile app, access
educational materials, clarify educational content, and exercise during biweekly in-person visits.
If the feasibility trial is successful, we will proceed to conduct a parallel, 2-arm, single blind, multi-site
superiority RCT to compare the effectiveness and value (cost-effectiveness) of SC versus TAU (CBR) in older
frail adults living rural counties. Our long-term objective is to provide hospital systems with high quality
evidence on how best to optimize uptake of CR and PR for older frail adults living in rural communities."

 Research suggests that early identification of individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis may be
able to improve illness course. Studies suggest that early identification of CHR using specialized interviews
with help-seeking individuals (with attenuated psychosis symptoms) is a useful approach. This work has two
major limitations: 1) interview methods have limited specificity as only 20% of CHR individuals convert to
psychosis, and 2) the expertise needed to make CHR diagnosis is only accessible in a few academic centers.
We propose to develop a new psychosis symptom domain sensitive (PSDS) battery, prioritizing tasks that
show correlations with the symptoms that define psychosis and are tied to the neurobiological systems and
computational mechanisms implicated in these symptoms. To promote accessibility, we utilize behavioral tasks
that could be administered over the internet; this will set the stage for later research testing widespread
screening that would identify those most in need of in-depth assessment. To reach that goal we first need
determine which tasks are effective for predicting illness course and how this strategy compares to published
prediction methods. We propose to recruit 500 CHR participants, 500 help-seeking individuals, and 500
healthy controls across 5 sites with the following Aims: Aim 1A) To develop a psychosis risk calculator through
the application of machine learning (ML) methods to the measures from the PSDS battery. In an exploratory
ML historical analysis, we will determine the added value of combining the PSDS with self-report measures and
predicators;Aim 1B) We will evaluate group differences on the risk calculator score and hypothesize
that the risk calculator score of the CHR group will differ from help-seeking and healthy controls. We further
hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR converters will differ significantly from groups of CHR
nonconverters, help-seeking and healthy controls. The inclusion of a help-seeking group is critical for
translating the risk-calculator into clinical practice, where the goal is to differentiate those at greatest risk for
psychosis from those with other forms of psychopathology; Aim 1C): Evaluate how baseline PSDS
performance relates to symptomatic outcome 2 years later examining: 1) symptomatic worsening treated as a
continuous variable, and 2) conversion to psychosis. We hypothesize that the PSDS calculator: 1) will predict
symptom course and, 2) that the differences observed between converters and nonconverters will be larger on
the PSDS calculator than on the NAPLS calculator. Aim 2) Use ML methods, as above, to develop calculators
that predict: 2A) social, and, 2B) role function deterioration, both observed over two years. Because negative
are more strongly linked to functional outcome than positive symptoms, we predict that negative mechanism tasks will be the strongest predictor of functional decline in both domains.This project will provide a next-generation CHR battery, tied to illness mechanisms and powered by cutting-edge computational methods that can be used to facilitate the earliest possible detection of psychosis risk."

 Hemophilia A results from a deficiency of FVIII-activity and can result in severe bleeding. Head bleeds
can be debilitating and joint-bleeds require major medical intervention. In this Phase IIB (PIIB) effort, we will
leverage our CE-marked FVIII fluorogenic substrate assay (FSA) to develop a cost-effective point-of-
care (POC) solution for measuring FVIII and emicizumab with a 15-minute turnaround time. Hemophilia
A is an X-linked recessive genetic disorder with an incidence of 1 in 5000 live male births. For patients with
hemophilia A, lifelong treatment is required to provide adequate and therapeutic FVIII or emicizumab FVIII-like
levels. FVIII replacement monitoring is essential to maintaining optimal dosing. Acute bleeding and surgeries
require knowledge of FVIII and/or FVIII-like levels for proper management. There are currently no approaches
at the point-of-care for FVIII or FVIII-like measurements, resulting in challenges to implementation and access.
 We have developed three innovations: (1) a high-sensitivity CE-marked FVIII fluorogenic assay
with bovine reagents and an emicizumab assay with human reagents, (2) pilot production test
cartridges that employ 4D microfluidics, a novel innovation we have developed for full sample-to-
answer processing, and (3) a pilot production hemophilia monitoring device and app that meets all CE-
marking and FDA 510k design control requirements. Three aims are outlined to attain data for CE-marking
and FDA 510k clearance: (1) Assess the accuracy and precision of all steps in our CLIA-waivable 4D sample-
to-answer microfluidic cartridge, consumables, and controls. (2) Characterize hemophilia monitoring solution
for turnaround time (TAT), analytical precision, interferences, ranges, limits of detection, and blind sample
analysis for FVIII and FVIII-like activity. (3) Perform clinical validation with Boston Children’s Hospital (N =
300) and a contract research organization (CRO) (N = 1200). In all these studies, we will continue to work with
the World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH) to ensure we have an approach for all patients worldwide.
 The success of developing a hemophilia POC diagnostic will allow a precision medicine approach for
the management of hemophilia A. Home use will allow for more frequent measurement of FVIII levels to
ensure therapeutic levels prior to engaging in physical activity and to assess correct dosage administration,
including potential missed doses. The approach can be utilized to create FVIII activity trends which can be
translated into immediate pK data, which can alert care providers to test for inhibitors. It will allow newer
therapies, including emicizumab, extended half-life PEGylated FVIII, and gene therapies to be monitored. The
results of our efforts will be a human-centered, hemophilia monitoring device and app that will provide accurate
and easy-to-use tests with the goals of decreasing risk of unexpected bleeding and increasing patient care in
all settings."

Tsetse flies (Glossina spp.; Diptera: Glossinidae) are the vectors of Trypanosoma spp., parasitic protozoa and
causative agents of human sleeping sickness and Animal African trypanosomiasis. Natural populations of tsetse
flies can be infected with strains of the endosymbiotic bacterium Sodalis glossinidius (Sodalis). In tsetse flies,
Sodalis undergoes both maternal and paternal transmission by invading tsetse cells and colonizing a wide range
of tissues, including those inhabited by trypanosomes. Notably, Sodalis reaches high cell densities, replicating
intra- and extracellularly in tsetse tissues, while neither triggering a tsetse immune response nor impairing the
fitness of the fly. These observations indicate that Sodalis has the ability to invade, survive, replicate and egress
from host cells. Whereas Sodalis invasion of insect cells depends on structural components of a protein secretion
apparatus, to date, no secreted proteins have been identified. Moreover, the identity of genes and pathways
required for intracellular survival, replication and host cell escape remains unknown. This poor understanding
of Sodalis physiology has resulted from the lack of robust techniques to genetically modify this bacterium, hence
hindering the development of Sodalis-based paratransgenesis of tsetse flies. We have recently developed two
methods for the efficient delivery of exogenous DNA into Sodalis cells. Using one of these methods, we have now
(1) implemented a powerful technique that combines CRISPR-Cas9 and bacteriophage recombineering to
introduce precise modifications into the Sodalis genome, (2) expanded the Sodalis genetic code to enable
incorporation of a noncanonical amino acid for protein tagging, and (3) introduced an efficient transposon
mutagenesis procedure suitable for high-throughput insertion sequencing. Using these tools, this proposal seeks
to establish foundational knowledge regarding molecular interactions between Sodalis and insect cells.
Specifically, we seek to (1) define the repertoire of Sodalis proteins secreted inside insect cells, identifying which
of these proteins promotes bacterium internalization, and (2) define the set of bacterial genes and pathways that
are required for intracellular survival and replication, for escape from within insect cells, and for maintaining a
persistent infection in the tsetse fly host."

While rodents have provided valuable information on key aspects of the gut-liver axis, there are fundamental
species-specific differences in the gut-liver axis, such as the composition of the microbiome, differences in liver
xenobiotic metabolism, and progression of alcoholic and metabolic fatty liver disease. Therefore, human-
relevant in vitro models now play important roles in complementing in vivo animal studies for basic science
and for drug screening. While considerable progress has been made in the development of human models of
intestine and the liver using physiologically relevant primary cells, very little has been done in engineering an
integrated human gut-liver model using primary cells. We have utilized droplet microfluidics to fabricate highly
monodisperse extracellular matrix (ECM)-based 3D liver microtissues containing primary human hepatocytes
and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells that are rapidly generated and functionally outperform self-assembled
hepatic spheroids and hepatocytes within bulk gels for 4+ weeks; furthermore, the microtissues can be further
augmented with human hepatic stellate cells and Kupffer cells. We have also separately developed in vitro
human intestine models using primary cells, which can be engineered to maintain gradients of O2 across the
basal and luminal surfaces to recapitulate the stem cell and differentiated cell compartments of the crypt; can
produce mucus; and are amenable to the incorporation of microbiota in the luminal compartment. Here, we will
engineer in vitro human gut-liver models of increasing complexities, which will be used to elucidate how
intestine, liver, and microbiota interact to modulate reciprocal functions. In aim 1, we will elucidate reciprocal
functional changes in a human gut-liver model containing primary human colonocytes and liver cells, while in
aim 2 we will introduce mucus and microbiota in the intestinal model and elucidate reciprocal crosstalk upon
co-culture with human liver microtissues. This proposal will yield a first-of-its-kind scalable human gut-liver
model containing primary cells for in vitro applications, such as compound screening and disease modeling."
10800961,"Peripheral artery disease (PAD), an arterial occlusive disease that impedes blood flow to the lower extremities,
can develop into critical limb ischemia (CLI), characterized by chronic ischemic rest pain with high risk for
amputation and cardiovascular complications. Patients with diabetes are disproportionally afflicted by both
PAD and CLI with limited medical interventions to improve limb perfusion. Angiogenesis is impaired in diabetic
patients and the mechanisms controlling this process are not fully understood.
 MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs capable of repressing gene expression and are
involved in a variety of pathophysiological processes with important therapeutic potential, though their role in
angiogenic signaling pathways in diabetic CLI remains poorly defined. Because miRNAs exhibit high
conservation across species, sequencing of miRNAs from the plasma of human subjects with diabetes and
increasing severity of PAD and diabetic mice with limb ischemia was used to identify overlapping, new miRNA
targets including a top candidate miR-130b. Preliminary gain and loss-of-function studies revealed that miR-
130b overexpression rapidly promoted proliferation, migration, and sprouting in endothelial cells (ECs),
whereas miR-130b inhibition exerted anti-angiogenic effects. ECs exposed to high glucose downregulated
miR-130b and co-transfection of miR-130b under high glucose conditions accelerated EC wound closure.
Local delivery of miR-130b mimics into ischemic muscles of diabetic db/db mice following femoral artery
ligation (FAL) promoted revascularization by increasing angiogenesis and markedly improved limb necrosis
and amputation. Mechanistically, overlapping downregulated transcripts from RNA-seq and miRNA prediction
algorithms identified that miR-130b directly targeted and repressed inhibin-b-A (INHBA), a subunit involved in
the formation of activin A, and downstream Smad2 signaling. Indeed, ectopic delivery of siRNA targeting Inhba
in db/db ischemic muscles following FAL improved revascularization and limb necrosis, recapitulating the
phenotype of miR-130b delivery. These observations provide the foundation for the central hypothesis that the
miR-130b-INHBA signaling axis may serve as a critical regulator of EC angiogenic responses for patients with
PAD and diabetes at risk of developing CLI. To better understand the precise role of miR-130b in INHBA
signaling and angiogenesis, we will in Aim1 delineate the molecular basis for miR-130b’s ability to regulate
INHBA signaling and EC angiogenic functions. In Aim2, we will determine the effect of altered miR-130b
expression in experimental critical limb ischemia in diabetic mice. Finally, in Aim3 we will assess the
expression of the miR-130b-INHBA signaling axis in a unique cohort of human subjects with CLI with or without
diabetes. Our studies will address a major gap in our understanding of diabetic CLI and inform how miR-130b-
INHBA mediated control of EC angiogenic functions may provide new targets for therapy."

determine the therapeutic potential of small-molecule Cdk8 inhibitors. 2) identify Cdk8 kinase substrates that are
promising, novel therapeutic targets; and 3) determine how Cdk8 mediates cardiac transcriptional responses in vivo (e.g.,
by phosphorylating transcription factors and modifiers) using both the small-molecule Cdk8 inhibitors and Cdk8
conditional cardiac knockout mice. Our central hypothesis is that Cdk8 in cardiomyocytes regulates the transition from a
steady-state to a hypertrophic gene program, driving functional remodeling and cardiac hypertrophy. Our preliminary
data implicate Cdk8 and its substrates as potential therapeutic targets to reduce activation of the hypertrophic gene
network, cardiac hypertrophy, and dysfunction in response to pathological hypertrophic stimuli. The central hypothesis
will be tested via the following specific aims: (1) Confirm that Cdk8 controls the initial cardiac response to pro-
hypertrophic stress [and in the later stage of HF decompensation]. (2) Determine the transcriptional consequences of
Cdk8 expression and activity during hypertrophic stress. (3) Identify Cdk8 targets that differentially regulate the cardiac
hypertrophic response. At the successful completion of the proposed research, the expected outcomes are: an
understanding of the Cdk8 kinase-dependent and kinase-independent mechanisms that serve as a key nodal point in
transcription to drive cardiac pathological gene expression networks and contribute to heart disease, and the
identification of potential new treatment modalities for pathological cardiac hypertrophy and the subsequent disease.
These results will provide a strong basis for further development of therapeutics targeting transcriptional mechanisms
that initiate remodeling of gene networks in response to cardiac stressors, which is expected to have a significant impact
on treating hypertensive cardiac hypertrophy by potentially reducing cardiac transcriptional remodeling. This research
aligns with the NHLBI’s mission to promote the prevention and treatment of heart disease by further defining the
activation of the hypertrophic gene network in models of heart disease."
10800986,"Project Summary/Abstract
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and multiple myeloma (MM) are cancers arising from mature lymphocytes that
collectively pose a substantial public health, personal and financial burden. Present knowledge of their
etiology is inadequate to inform prevention strategies; data from prospective studies, and for specific histologic
subtypes, are particularly limited. Inflammation, heightened immune activation and growth factor dysregulation
contribute to their pathogenesis, as indicated, for example, by well-known associations of NHL risk with severe
immune compromise and with pre-diagnosis plasma immune marker profiles that indicate inflammation and B-
cell activation, as well as by consistent findings of an increased risk of MM and some NHL subtypes in obese
individuals and in persons with autoimmune disease. Relevant to the present application, evidence from both
model organism and human occupational studies support the hypothesis that environmental pollutants with
carcinogenic and/or immunotoxic effects—such as dioxins and hazardous air pollutants (HAPs)—may be risk
factors for MM and/or NHL. However, those studies have many limitations, and most do not assess general
population risk from low-dose, passive and possibly chronic exposure to those pollutants or to combinations of
multiple pollutants. Geographic information system (GIS)-based modeling of these exposures offers a
valid and well accepted tool for examining environmental risk factors for MM, NHL and common
histologic subtypes of NHL and could yield novel insights into their etiopathogenesis. The prospective
studies proposed in this application will leverage strong investigator expertise and an active collaboration and
will include eight large and diverse cohorts, including geocoded residential histories spanning many decades
and a projected sample size of ~5,386 incident MM and ~20,354 incident NHL cases. Cox proportional
hazard models will be used to examine GIS-modeled passive exposure to dioxins and HAPs (individual and
mixtures of pollutants, the latter using quantile G-computation and Bayesian approaches) with known or
plausible carcinogenic or immunotoxic properties in relation to risk of MM, NHL, major histologic subtypes and
clinically relevant molecular subtypes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), an aggressive histologic type
of NHL with unknown etiologies. The analyses will incorporate already-harmonized individual-level time-varying
risk factor data to assess and control confounding by lifestyle, occupation, demographic and medical history-
related risk factors. Additional analyses will assess timing of susceptibility and heterogeneity of observed
associations by NHL histologic subtype, calendar period, sex, age, race/ethnicity, body mass index, smoking
and socio-demographic and neighborhood contextual factors. The proposed studies have strong potential to
yield novel insights on the contribution of passive, low-level exposure to environmental factors to the etiology
of MM and NHL, including on risk to individual histologic subtypes of NHL and molecular subtypes of DLBCL,
and thus to provide urgently needed identification of novel risk factors for these understudied cancers."
10800993,"Chlamydia trachomatis is a well-recognized PID pathogen for which no vaccine is available. Women are at risk
for reproductive sequelae when infection ascends into the upper reproductive tract, driving inflammatory
processes that trigger immune pathology. However, the bacterial and/or host factors that govern ascension and
subsequent pathology remain unknown. Our long-term goal is to identify biomarkers that identify women at risk
for reproductive morbidity or correlate with protective immunity. We and others have established that
susceptibility to human chlamydial genital infection is mediated by pathogen abundance, co-infection, oral
contraceptives and cervicovaginal microbiota. The overall objective of this proposal is to identify cervical
discriminators of asymptomatic, ascending chlamydial infection and endometritis in women. The central
hypothesis is that overall risk for ascending infection is modulated by local host inflammatory responses,
pathogen fitness and environmental factors mediated by the cervicovaginal microbiome. Our rationale is that
identifying these factors will accelerate rational vaccine design and testing. In a pilot study of women at high risk
for STIs, we demonstrated the potential for unbiased characterization of host, pathogen and microbiome
interactions using transcriptomics and determined that a single cervical specimen was sufficient to detect
clustered host transcriptional profiles reflecting microbiome differences and STI infection. Guided by strong
preliminary data and leveraging ongoing NIH funded research, the following four specific aims will test our
hypothesis: 1) Profile cervical immune response with respect to ascending infection and susceptibility to
reinfection; 2) Profile chlamydial transcriptional activity associated with ascending infection; 3) Profile
transcriptionally active microflora in Chlamydia-infected women to determine how these complex microbial
communities modulate ascending infection; and 4) Integrate host, pathogen and microbiome responses to
determine key pathways controlling outcome. The first aim will profile cervical inflammatory responses and
immune cell populations from women with local infection or upper tract involvement in a cohort of highly-exposed
women (TRAC2). We will transcriptionally profile the chlamydial strains causing their infections and use
metatranscriptomics to characterize the contribution of the cervicovaginal microbiome. Finally, we will use robust
biostatistical approaches to improve and expand our understanding of key chlamydia–host interactions that
modulate infection outcomes, drive disease and establish protective immunity. The research proposed is
innovative, in our opinion, because it will implement a comprehensive, non-biased approach to the identification
of molecular biomarkers in a highly disease-relevant clinical population. The proposed research is significant
because it is expected to translate directly to anti-chlamydial vaccine evaluation in humans and to have broad
importance for diagnosis and for evaluation of novel therapeutics."

Obesity has solid inflammatory underpinnings, which are risk factors for various chronic inflammatory and
metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, how obesity provokes aberrant inflammation
remains to be defined. Recent studies indicate that small extracellular vesicles (sEVs, a.k.a., exosomes)
carrying RNA, including microRNA (miRNA), play a critical role in inducing inflammation in obesity. In this
study, we aim to demonstrate that RNA silencing machinery plays a critical role in modulating RNA cargo
profiles in sEV-secreting cells and also in responding to exposure of RNA cargos of sEVs in sEV-receiving
cells. Our overarching goal is to reveal how RNA silencing machinery-mediated, sEV-induced events are
critical for controlling obesity-associated inflammation, impacting the development of chronic inflammatory
and metabolic diseases.
Small EVs are released from many cell types into the extracellular space and are distributed in body fluids.
These sEVs, taken up by neighboring and distant cells, subsequently modulate the functions of recipient cells.
Hence sEVs have emerged as important transducers of intercellular communication, with their cargos,
including miRNAs, playing critical roles in modulating sEV-recipient cellular activities. Our Preliminary data
show that circulating EVs from obese adolescents are enriched with specific RNA cargo and exhibit higher
pro-inflammatory traits, than those from lean subjects. Further, our newly established mouse model, which
enables us to monitor specific cell type-derived sEVs in vivo, indicates that in obesity, sEVs become pro-
inflammatory and when engulfed by macrophages, these pro-inflammatory sEVs induce inflammatory
responses in macrophages. These intriguing Preliminary data suggest novel mechanisms for EV-induced
inflammation in obesity.
Studies in this proposal will: (1) assess the role of RNA silencing machinery in sEV-secreting cells in
generating pro-inflammatory sEVs, and (2) evaluate the role of RNA silencing machinery in sEV-receiving
cells in mediating sEV-induced inflammation.
By utilizing our novel mouse models coupled with access to human samples and models, our systematic
approaches will reveal novel mechanisms of how the pathogenicity of sEVs is critical in the development of
inflammation in obesity-associated pathophysiology."

Although cannabis use has declined among youth in recent years, the rates of cannabis use among youth in
the juvenile justice system have steadily increased, including among youth with early juvenile justice
involvement. This rise is concerning because cannabis use among early justice-involved youth in the juvenile
justice system places them at risk of other poor outcomes (e.g., continued and chronic system involvement,
contraction of HIV/STIs). Thus, the overall goal of this Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award
(K23) is to support the applicant in developing an independent research program in the development and
adaptation of efficacious family-based intervention approaches for treating cannabis use and associated
consequences (e.g., rearrest, HIV/STI risk behaviors) for underserved, justice-involved youth. Specific training
goals are: 1) develop methodological expertise in family-based intervention research for adolescent cannabis
use; 2) gain competence in executing ethical intervention adaptation research with justice-involved youth; 3)
build expertise in using qualitative methods for treatment adaptation; and 4) obtain advanced quantitative skills
in randomized clinical trial design and data analysis. The applicant will achieve these goals through a mix of
mentoring, didactics, and practical experience. Across the 5-year training plan, the candidate will receive
mentorship pertaining to her goals from: Dr. Kathleen Kemp (Rhode Island Hospital/Brown University), Dr.
Anthony Spirito (Brown University) and Dr. Richard Jones (Brown University). The primary objective of the
proposed research project is to evaluate the initial feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of a brief (i.e., 6-
session), modular adaptation of an existing family-based intervention for cannabis use and other risk behaviors
(e.g., HIV/STI risk, delinquency) among early justice-involved youth. In the formative research phase, clinicians
(N = 12) working with youth in the juvenile justice system will participate in qualitative interviews to give
feedback on the proposed adapted family-based intervention protocol. In the open trial phase, 12 youths and
parents will be recruited through a juvenile court to participate in an open trial of the proposed intervention to
assess initial outcomes related to the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. Finally, in the pilot
randomized clinical trial phase, 60 parents and youths will again be recruited through the juvenile court and
randomized to either the proposed intervention or a parenting psychoeducation control condition. Baseline, 3-
months and 6-month follow-up measures of cannabis and other substance use, HIV/STI risk behaviors, and
delinquency, as well as measures pertaining to parenting practices and parent well-being will be collected."

Treatment options for Alzheimer’s disease have been elusive, in large part because the molecular mecha-
nisms underlying AD remain unclear. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have uncovered genomic
loci associated with increased risk of AD; however, the exact causal variants within these loci and the genes
they affect have been difficult to determine. While many lines of evidence suggest that these variants alter
transcriptional regulatory networks in microglia, primary human microglia are hard to acquire and intrac-
table for many genome-editing, genomic, and high-throughput technologies. The overall objective of this
proposal is to determine how AD causal SNPs alter microglia regulatory networks. Using microglia derived
from human induced pluripotent stem cells, we will define transcriptional regulatory networks in resting and
activated microglia (Aim 1), identify the causal SNPs within each AD GWAS locus (Aim 2), and determine the
genes affected by AD-associated SNPs (Aim 3). Accomplishment of the goals set forth here will establish
a cell culture model of microglial response to AD stimuli, determine the causal AD variants at each GWAS
locus, and identify the genes impacted by AD-associated SNPs. These results will have a positive impact
because they will identify the key genes involved in AD pathogenicity, providing a foundation for further
studies towards the development of tools to diagnose, prognose, and treat AD."

hospitalized with heart failure due to SVD die, and 25% require cardiac transplant. This unacceptable morbidity
and mortality is due to both the anatomic abnormalities of SVD unfavorably loading the infant myocardium, and
the lack of drugs proven efficacious in this population. The absence heart failure therapeutics in infants with
SVD is a public health crisis, necessitating an urgent and systematic response to address drug development
challenges in this population. Recently, the Na+/K+-ATPase inhibitor digoxin was the first ever drug found in
retrospective studies to improve survival in infants with SVD. Despite this promising finding, therapeutic failures
occurred. While the cause of failures may be multifactorial, the experience with digoxin in heart failure due to
SVD illustrates the knowledge gaps and limitations of current pediatric heart failure drug development. Digoxin
is a narrow therapeutic index drug renally eliminated via glomerular filtration. While pharmacokinetics (PK) and
exposure targets are known in adults, the PK and pharmacodynamics (PD) of digoxin have not been studied in
infants with SVD. In this population, growth and maturation dynamically interact with disease pathophysiologic
changes to affect drug disposition and response. For digoxin, renal maturation and kidney injury oppositely
affect drug exposure, while the infantile cardiomyocyte, the digoxin target, is structurally, metabolically, and
functionally altered by immaturity and SVD. Though incompletely understood, these interactions likely affect
digoxin efficacy through differing exposure, response, or both. Understanding how ontogeny and disease
interact to alter drug exposure and response is essential to reducing treatment failures and inform development

 Most head-and-neck cancer patients receiving radiotherapy treatment develop life-long adverse effects.
Side effects presented as hyposalivation and chronic xerostomia result from radiation damage to nearby
salivary glands. Limited palliative options are currently available for these patients, reinforcing the need for
regenerative therapies. Our regenerative efforts, using non-viral gene therapy to overexpress water channel
Aquaporin-1 (AQP1) in radiation-surviving salivary gland epithelial cells, showed restorative results by
increasing salivary flow into the oral cavity. However, as both viral and non-viral vectors are restricted by the
ability to provide long-term expression, a next generation of AQP1 therapy that results in sustained gene
expression awaits.
 Our preliminary data demonstrates that methylation of the endogenous AQP1 promoter in epithelial cells is
an important mediator of gene expression. In addition, the methylation status alters after exposure to radiation.
Based on these findings, we hypothesize that epigenetic altering of the AQP1 promoter in radiation-surviving
epithelial cells facilitates a change towards sustained endogenous AQP1 expression. To test this hypothesis,
we adapted a new CRISPR method and aim to (1) demonstrate the negative correlation between the level of
methylation and AQP1 expression, and (2) develop in vitro and in vivo methods to optimally alter the
methylation level of the AQP1 promoter in irradiated epithelial cells.
 These studies bring in vivo epigenetic editing to a reality as a means of modulating endogenous gene
expression and sustained water movement in damaged salivary glands. As a result, this continuous production
of salivary flow can resolve xerostomia in radiated head-and-neck cancer patients in a long-term setting."
10807593,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder that is poised to reach epidemic
proportions given our rapidly aging population. As such, the identification of risk and resilience factors that
might curb the progression of AD and delay symptom onset is a national public health imperative. Multiple
emerging lines of research demonstrate that sleep disturbance, and particularly obstructive sleep apnea (OSA,
a very common disorder in older adults), and poor cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) are associated with
increased risk for AD pathology and cognitive decline. Furthermore, new evidence suggests that OSA and
CRF may interact in their relation to AD; however, thus far, this potential interaction is poorly understood
because of the dearth of relevant data and because AD pathology is present long before detectable signs of
dementia are observed. The overall objective of this project is to fill a critical gap in AD research by deploying
advanced methods to estimate the age of onset of AD biomarkers in the Wisconsin Sleep Cohort (WSC), relate
this emergent pathophysiology to midlife OSA and fitness, and determine how midlife OSA and fitness
influence trajectories of cognitive impairment in later life. The WSC has followed adult participants since the
late 1980s and is the only longitudinal cohort with objective sleep, fitness, and neurocognitive data spanning
decades to explain how OSA and CRF interrelate to predict AD onset. Accordingly, by leveraging the unique
sleep and health data available in the WSC Study, results from this proposal will elucidate midlife risk
transducers of AD pathology and dementia. In this investigation, we will prospectively collect blood plasma,
MRI, and PET biomarkers of AD and neurocognitive data in a sample of 300 WSC participants who are now
older aged, to address two Specific Aims with testable hypotheses supported by preliminary data: Aim 1 will
identify the effects of more severe OSA and poorer midlife CRF on multiple AD biomarkers, determine whether
midlife OSA and CRF delay the age of amyloid onset, a key indicator of AD pathology, and examine if
trajectories of OSA and CRF interact to predict AD pathology in later life; Aim 2 will determine whether similar
patterns of OSA and fitness are associated with clinical endpoints of cognitive decline and dementia. For all
Aims, it is expected that higher CRF will serve as a protective factor, moderating relations between OSA and
AD pathology and cognitive decline. Detailed sleep and health history data available in the WSC allows for key
covariates to be evaluated in analyses interrogating our Aims. Addressing the Aims of this application will fill a
significant and critical need in AD research by capitalizing on an existing cohort with extensive midlife
phenotyping of two salient lifestyle factors associated with lower AD risk. In so doing, this project will ultimately
lead to improved preventative and therapeutic strategies that target sleep and fitness as modifiable risk factors
for AD."

In traditional predictive genetic testing single gene variants are analyzed to determine whether an individual is
at high risk of developing a disease. The vast majority of diseases, however, are polygenic—caused by many
different genes. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) have been heralded for their promise to predict risk for these more
complex diseases like heart disease or diabetes by measuring the contribution of hundreds or thousands of
genetic variants at once. Yet beyond prediction of health or medical outcomes, the realm of `sociogenomics' is
developing polygenic scores (PGS) measuring genetic contributions to social traits and behavioral factors, such
as income, educational attainment, sexuality, and optimism. Proponents of sociogenomic PGS cite the
potential for this research to increase understanding of the interplay between genetic and environmental
factors, to account for genetic factors in social science research, and to create personalized social interventions
akin to personalized medicine. But others worry that sociogenomic PGS findings could lead to discrimination
and an exacerbation of existing social disparities. In order to understand the ethical, legal, and social
implications of sociogenomic PGS research and its outcomes, this project addresses the following research
questions: 1) What are the current trends in the development of sociogenomic PGS and what are the possible
applications of scores in social settings?; 2) How do various stakeholders perceive the benefits and risks of
sociogenomic PGS?; and 3) How well do existing laws, policies, or governance protect against the potential
harms of sociogenomic PGS while also promoting their potential benefits? Answering these questions requires
both empirical research and legal analysis. Using horizon scanning methodologies, Aim 1 maps the landscape
of sociogenomic PGS, their potential applications, and how sociogenomic research findings are presented to
and consumed by the public. Aim 2 enlists those involved in the pipeline of sociogenomics research (biobank
participants whose genetic data may be used to develop PGS, PGS researchers who develop the scores, and
social scientists who may use the scores in their research studies) to examine and assess their attitudes toward
the range of harms and benefits of sociogenomic PGS, and the implications of varying applications of PGS.
Both of these efforts will inform Aim 3, which consists of a legal and policy analysis of how current legal rules
protect against potential misuse and/or promote possible benefits of sociogenomic findings. The product of
this project will be a set of case studies designed to help policy makers and researchers anticipate and mitigate
the potential harms of employing sociogenomic PGS in various social settings while still identifying and
maximizing potential benefits."

There is a fundamental gap in understanding the effect of local delivery of antibiotics for the prevention and
treatment of peri-prosthetic joint infections, a truly morbid and costly complication threatening >1 million
patients undergoing joint arthroplasty each year. There is currently no fully load-bearing medical device which
can also be used for the controlled release of antibiotics to treat peri-prosthetic joint infection (PJI). The current
standard of treatment (there is none for prevention) involves a two-stage revision during which patients are
immobilized for more than 3 months. Available treatments are effective only about 40-80% of the time with
recurrence increasing morbidity, mortality and cost tremendously. There is a great need to improve outcomes,
patients’ quality of life and to reduce cost.
Our long-term goal is to develop materials and methods to enable and thoughtfully control the local release of
therapeutics to treat orthopaedic conditions. The overall objective of this application is to devise an antibiotic-
eluting and load-bearing joint implant platform technology and its implementation strategy to improve the
treatment of PJI. Our central hypothesis is that by manipulating the synergy of incorporated drugs,
drug/polymer interactions and drug incorporation methods, an ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene
(UHMWPE) implant with optimal antibiotic efficiency and safety can be designed. The rationale for the
proposed research is that by using a newly discovered antibiotic synergy between local PJI antibiotics and
commonly used analgesics, we can optimize drug elution profiles with maximum efficacy in preventing the
growth of clinically relevant infections of variable risk. This strategy has the potential of changing the treatment
paradigms for improved outcomes without any additional risks to patients. The specific aims are (1) identifying
the factors in engineering UHMWPE with synergistic antibacterial release and (2) developing preclinical risk-
stratification tests for the implementation of antibiotic-eluting UHMWPE. The challenge of developing a tough,
fully load-bearing and wear resistant surface while incorporating drugs in the polymer will be overcome by two
strategies: introducing highly eccentric drug clusters that enable lower drug loading and spatially limiting the
drug-loaded regions to low load bearing regions of the implant. The approach is innovative firstly because it
departs from the current methods of depending on antibiotic elution from temporary, non-weight bearing bone
cement devices often assembled in the operating room and secondly because analgesics, which can improve
the efficacy of antibiotics, can be delivered concurrently at a predetermined rate using this device. The
expected outcome is a platform bearing surface technology and an implementation strategy tailored to the
infecting microorganism. The strategies capitalize on the team’s expertise in the development of clinically used
UHMWPE implants based on innovations in antioxidant stabilization, cross-linking and morphology
manipulation. We present strong preliminary data showing the feasibility of our ideas including incorporating
vancomycin in UHMWPE with safe and efficient release in pre-clinical planktonic and biofilm infection models
and the synergy between the analgesic drugs ketorolac and bupivacaine with gentamicin. The proposed
research is significant, because it is expected to provide a new, safe and efficient implant for combating PJI,
which can eliminate the costly and burdensome gold standard of two-stage revision with temporary
immobilization."

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a painful debilitating life-long condition resulting from mutations in the gene encoding
hemoglobin β subunit, causing abnormal hemoglobin polymerization leading to hemolysis, repeated
vasooclusion, and chronic systemic inflammation resulting in substantial global morbidity and early mortality.
Curative therapy for SCD relies on hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation, however the damaging effects
of SCD pathophysiology on HSCs remain uncharacterized and we seek to fill this gap in current knowledge. Our
preliminary studies show that HSCs display increased cycling in a transgenic SCD mouse model upon aging,
and myeloid lineage biased in vitro differentiation of SCD patient derived HSCs. As a postdoctoral fellow in the
McKinney-Freeman laboratory, I will investigate the functional consequences and molecular mechanisms
underlying SCD mediated HSC cycling in a murine model and translate these findings to human HSC during
SCD. In Aim 1, I will use colony formation assays, limiting dilution primary and secondary HSC transplantation,
and serial exposure to chemotherapy to assess the detrimental impact of SCD-induced cycling on HSC
frequency and function. In Aim 2, I will probe the molecular and epigenetic dysregulation underlying increased
HSC cycling during SCD. HSCs isolated from SCD and control mice will be subjected to bulk RNA-seq and
ATAC-seq to define transcriptional dysregulation correlated with changes in gene promoter accessibility
meditating increased cycling. Finally, I will translate our findings to humans by interrogating cell cycle
dysregulation in HSCs isolated from SCD patients (Aim 3). SCD patient-derived bone marrow aspirates will be
profiled for frequency of phenotypic HSCs and alterations in cell cycle status by flow cytometry and ex vivo EdU
incorporation. Lineage potential and hematopoietic output of SCD HSCs will be analyzed by colony formation
and in vitro single HSC differentiation assays. Lastly, SCD HSC repopulating potential and self-renewal will be
examined by limiting dilution primary and secondary transplantation into human cytokine expressing immune
deficient mice. Together the proposed studies serve to deepen our understanding of a previously unexplored
aspect of HSC biology by examining the impact of SCD. Greater understanding of SCD mediated mechanisms
of HSC impairment become exceptionally important as autologous HSC transplantation following gene editing
or gene therapy for SCD improve and increase in frequency. These aims draw on my prior training in cancer
biology of hematologic malignancies but also provide abundant novel training opportunities in the field of HSC
biology and for professional career development. The McKinney-Freeman lab and St. Jude Children’s Research
Hospital are ideal environments in which to receive training in the study HSC biology, combining state-of-the-art

Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading killer among infectious diseases, and global progress against this pandemic has
been set back by COVID-19. Major difficulties in combating TB are the need for months of multidrug therapy to
ensure a high probability of relapse-free cure, and its ability to survive in the air as infectious aerosols and create
a large pool of infected people. The requirement for prolonged drug treatment is likely due to the minority of
bacteria that are able to survive antibiotics for a long duration, even in the absence of genetically-encoded
resistance. Such bacteria are termed persisters. Similarly, transmission events rely on the subset of bacteria that
are able to survive aerosolization stress until it reaches a new host. While recent strides have been made in
understanding these subpopulations of cells, a way to interrogate their transcriptional states at a single-cell
resolution in a high-throughput, unbiased manner does not exist. This limits understanding of the biology of these
cells over time, and restricts identification of vulnerabilities that could be exploited to shorten TB treatment
duration or reduce transmission. The aim of this proposal is to apply a method of single-cell RNA sequencing
(sc-RNAseq) that allows for simultaneous comparison of the transcriptomes of thousands of cells of
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of TB.
Preliminary data demonstrate that the protocol, which relies on in situ reverse transcription and barcoding with
combinatorial indexing, is feasible in Mtb. In this application, the first aim is to test the limitations and
characteristics of the technique in pre-defined mixtures of Mtb containing different plasmids. Over the first year
of the grant, we will evaluate (1) the number of genes detected per cell, (2) the detection threshold of the smallest
predefined subpopulation, and (3) the concordance of the aggregation of the single-cell transcriptome to bulk
transcriptomes. With these parameters defined, the sc-RNAseq will be applied to biologically relevant in vitro
conditions in the second year, including Mtb exposed to the front-line TB drug rifampin (RIF) and Mtb undergoing
desiccation stress, a model of aerosolization. Here, the clusters of subpopulation transcriptomes found by the
method will be compared with orthogonal, observable, and predictable phenotypes including cultivability and RIF
resistance over time. These two aims will validate baseline characteristics of the assay, lay the foundation for
leveraging this method against more complex biological samples in the future, and begin defining the
fundamental biology of Mtb subpopulation behavior in response to stress."

Microbial interaction between Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) and Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) worsens
inflammation in periodontal disease (PD), promoting damage to connective tissues, alveolar bone resorption,
and tooth loss. Chronic PD also accelerates oral cancers and is a risk factor for multiple diseases. Nonsurgical
treatments for PD include mechanical debridement with or without broad-spectrum antibiotics. However, current
antibiotics for PD have drawbacks, including exacerbation of oral dysbiosis; intestinal dysbiosis, which is a risk
factor for microbiota shift diseases; and enriching the spread of antimicrobial resistance. We hypothesize that a
narrow-spectrum agent that selectively eliminates Pg or Pg and Fn would be a valuable adjunct to debridement.
Such agents could potentially decrease inflammation, making the periodontal environment more favorable for
colonization by healthy oral microbes. We will test this hypothesis by exploring the isoenzyme FabK as a drug
target for narrow-spectrum agents. FabK, enoyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) reductase II, is a key enzyme in the
bacterial fatty acid synthesis pathway (FAS II) that catalyzes the elongation step of bacterial type II fatty acid
synthesis (FAS-II) to make lipids for membranes and virulence. Inhibition of FAS II causes a strong antibacterial
effect. Pg and Fn uniquely express the FabK isozyme, which is structurally and mechanistically distinct from
FabI and other enoyl-ACP reductase isozymes that are found in many other oral species. Our hypothesis is
backed by strong preliminary data supporting the essentiality of FabK to Pg and Fn, as FabK inhibitors stop their
growth. Our long-term goal is to establish a drug discovery platform for inhibitors of Pg and Fn FabK enzymes
to eliminate these organism(s) in PD and other oral diseases. The objectives of this application are to define the
characteristics for a suitable target product profile, by determining: 1) the cellular effect of FabK inhibition in
planktonic and biofilm communities (aim 1a); 2) in vivo druggability of FabK in chronic PD, based on efficacy of
known inhibitors (aim 1b); and 3) the structural and substrate requirements for inhibition and catalysis of Pg or
both Pg and Fn FabKs, which will guide the chemical expansion and optimization of future inhibitors (aim 2). We
anticipate the results will attain benchmarks for an advanced discovery program to develop drug candidates with
desirable antimicrobial, mechanistic, and chemical profiles to prevent and treat PD. Such technologies may also
have wider applications for PD-related systemic diseases. We also expect to advance knowledge of Pg and Fn
FAS-II lipid metabolism in PD and biochemical insights of FabK activity in these organisms."

historically performed poorly in the areas of science, technology, and math. With the proper
training and mentorship, the untapped workforce present within these schools will be empowered
to understand and address current and emerging environmental health and safety threats.
Through this transformative 8-week high school research program, we will develop well-prepared,
ethical researchers committed to scientific inquiry, intensive fieldwork, and collaborative problem-
solving to address environmental health challenges. Following the 4-step risk assessment
process, students, teachers, and faculty mentors will work collaboratively to identify toxicants,
potential hazards and risks, and environmental disparities in urban neighborhoods, which
provides the necessary training to formulate critical thinking skills for use in academic or non-
academic careers. Within our program, students will be considered Environmental Health
Scholars who engage in air and water research, test experimental hypotheses, and define
potential health risks for select Atlanta communities. The comprehensive approach our program
provides will develop interest in college-level study in environmental health and formulate critical
thinking skills for use in academic or non-academic careers. Participating high school teachers or
Teaching Fellows will be provided additional educational training in environmental health issues
at Georgia State University School of Public Health Center of Teaching Excellence and Learning
and participate in summer research training along with the environmental health scholars."

The hypoxia of high-altitude (HA, >2500 m) increases the frequency of fetal growth restriction (FGR) 3-fold.
Reduced uteroplacental perfusion is an important contributor to altitude-associated FGR and is determined, in
part, by reduced vasodilatory sensitivity of the myometrial (MyoA) and uterine arteries (UtA). It is therefore vital
to define mechanisms that defend uteroplacental blood flow and fetal growth under hypoxic conditions. Using a
metabolomic approach we have found maternal and fetal circulating nucleotide metabolites belonging to the
purinergic signaling pathway (i.e., adenosine, ADP, AMP, ATP, UDP, UDP-glucose) to differ between HA and
low altitude (400 m) in Bolivia, we also observed differences in nucleotide abundance when comparing FGR with
uncomplicated pregnancies. Furthermore, our preliminary functional data showed that adenosine vasodilates
MyoA and chorionic plate arteries (CPA), the latter are fetoplacental vessels important for the regulation of fetal
circulation. In addition, confirming the role of these nucleotides, purinergic receptor agonists known to act as
vasconstrictors evoked vasoconstriction in CPA. Thus, we

Aim 1 will establish the effect of HA
pregnancy on the maternal plasma metabolome by mass spectrometry, determine the effect of vasoactive
metabolites that differ between altitudes on MyoA vasoreactivity by myography and, using a targeted approach,
determine the relationship between the maternal metabolome and UtA blood flow. Aim 2 will determine the effect
of HA on the fetal circulation metabolome, the regulation of CPA vasoreactivity by vasoactive nucleotides, and
establish the relationship of such effects for fetal oxygenation and growth. In both aims, we will measure protein
expression in MyoA and CPA of key purinergic receptors, ectonucleotidases, and enzymes known to participate
in purinergic signaling. Our findings will provide the basis for our future research to identify molecular pathways
that integrate uteroplacental and fetoplacental perfusion and cellular metabolism during pregnancy to maintain
fetal growth."
10809128,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable and premature disease, disability, and death in the US and is
often concentrated among marginalized and minoritized groups, resulting in myriad health inequities. Training
a workforce to understand, conduct, and evaluate the rigor of addictions research is critical to expanding
innovations in tobacco use prevention and treatment and enabling the rapid translation of evidence-based
interventions in routine healthcare delivery, ultimately reducing tobacco-related health inequities. By
leveraging extant NIDA investments and creating new courses and activities, the Supporting Tobacco-Related
Ongoing Education and Research (STRONGER) Scholar Program will provide research and education
experiences to prepare the next generation of clinician-scientists to address tobacco/nicotine addiction and its
associated health inequities in research and practice. The STRONGER Scholar Program will provide research
education in tobacco addiction science to medical students (7 Med Scholars x5 cohorts) and clinically-focused
doctoral trainees (4 Grad Scholars x4 cohorts), matriculating a total of 51 Scholars with >50% identifying as
members of racial or ethnic minoritized groups, women, and other groups who are underrepresented in the
biomedical, behavioral, and social sciences. The STRONGER Scholar Program will build Scholars’
competencies in: 1) tobacco dependence treatment knowledge, 2) tobacco research knowledge and skills, with
attention to health equity science; 3) resiliency for a research-inclusive career; and 4) responsible conduct of
research through participation in a mentored research project and courses for skills development. The Specific
Aims of the STRONGER Scholar Program are to: 1) identify, select, train, and mentor qualified trainees,
resulting in an over-time increase in knowledge, skills, and interest in conducting tobacco addiction research;
2) increase scholars’ knowledge of tobacco/nicotine dependence and treatment through a competency-based
curriculum, fostering skill development and interprofessional learning experiences; 3) systematically evaluate
all aspects of the research education program using a mixed methods approach to enhance and strengthen the
program iteratively over time; and 4) achieve >51 professional conference presentations and >51 peer-reviewed
publications; disseminating information about the program, its research, and its scholars through social media
outlets, a website, and health campaign messaging. The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center has
no other NIDA-funded tobacco addiction science research and education programs. The program aligns with
the institution’s strategic planning goals and its Scholars will benefit from the rich resources for scholarly and
professional development at the nation’s #1 cancer center. The goal of the STRONGER Scholar program is to
enhance clinically-focused trainees’ interest in, ability to be successful within, and – ultimately – pursuit of a
research-inclusive career in tobacco addiction science."
10812360,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Glutamate receptors mediate the spread of excitation in the mammalian central nervous system, and
ultimately control physiological functions such as movement and cognition. They are classified into four
subfamilies: N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), -amino-5-methyl-3-hydroxy-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA),
kainate, and delta receptors. All four subtypes are topologically similar, comprising four protein subunits held
together as a dimer-of-dimers. However, their gating characteristics and mechanisms are unique, reflecting
distinct roles in synaptic transmission. The goal of my laboratory is to understand the mechanisms that underlie
the functional fine-tuning of each of these subtypes. Using a multipronged approach that combines biochemical,
electrophysiological, fluorescence, and computational methods, we have already identified conformational
transitions that are critical for mediating activation and inhibition of AMPA and NMDA glutamate receptors.
However, a direct understanding of how such structural changes in one part of the protein control changes in
other parts, and how they dictate functional properties, remains unknown. We propose to develop and use
multicolor single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to draw structure–function
correlations between different segments of each glutamate receptor subtype. We will also focus our efforts on
understanding the less well-studied kainate and delta subtypes. Specifically, we will investigate the mechanisms
underlying activation and modulation of an abundant form of the kainate receptor by agonists, ions, and auxiliary
proteins. In addition, we have preliminary data showing that delta receptor function is dependent on connections
with trans-synaptic protein complexes, therefore we will study the structure and function of delta receptors in the
context of synaptic binding partners. Together, these investigations will place our fundamental single-molecule
investigations in a physiological context, and eventually allow us to understand functional differences between
synaptic and non-synaptic glutamate receptors."
10812361,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Swarup S. Swaminathan, MD is an Assistant Professor of Ophthalmology at the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute
with a career goal of becoming an independent clinician-scientist in the field of glaucoma clinical research. His
overall research focus is to utilize novel statistical and data science methodologies to improve assessment of
progression in glaucoma and early detection of those patients at greatest risk for irreversible vision loss. The
primary objectives of this K23 career development proposal are: 1) to compare currently available methods
used to monitor glaucomatous disease progression with higher-order Bayesian prediction models equipped
with data from electronic health records (EHR), and 2) to provide an academic glaucoma specialist with the
mentored research experience and formal training to conduct independent clinical research. Achieving these
objectives will provide the critical skills required to establish an independent research program focused on
applying data science principles to improve the clinical assessment of progression in glaucoma patients. The
proposed K23 application will provide valuable mentorship and formal training in biostatistics, analysis of large
databases containing longitudinal data, application of Bayesian statistics in the medical sciences, and artificial
intelligence and machine learning data analysis. The extensive technical resources available at the Bascom
Palmer Eye Institute and University of Miami Institute for Data Science & Computing, the mentorship and
expertise of his advisory committee, and the dedicated institutional commitment will provide Dr. Swaminathan
with the support needed to transition into an independent clinician-scientist. He will regularly meet with his
mentors and advisors to discuss career development, attend pertinent university seminars and workshops,
present ongoing research at national meetings, and consistently submit his work for publication. This proposal
will test the hypothesis that EHR-equipped Bayesian models outperform ordinary least square (OLS)
regression in accuracy and their ability to detect progression earlier. In Aim 1, Bayesian models equipped with
EHR population-level imaging and functional data will be constructed to calculate the rate of change in optical
coherence tomography and standard automated perimetry metrics of individual patients. In Aim 2, patient-
specific risk factor data will be incorporated into Bayesian models to further refine these individualized
predictions. These models will be compared to OLS regression, with the hypothesis that Bayesian models will
be superior. Finally, in Aim 3, an interactive application will be developed to gather data from clinical practice in
order to validate the use of Bayesian models in clinical care. An expert clinician panel will compare masked
OLS and Bayesian estimates from these cases. The results of the proposed research will provide the
foundation for an R01 grant examining the use of EHR data to improve clinical decision-making for the
longitudinal care of glaucoma patients."
10816254,"ADMINISTRATIVE CORE ABSTRACT
The Administrative Core is the central hub for all activities of the proposed Translational Center for
Microphysiological Systems-Based Drug Development Tools for Pregnancy and Women's Health. The Core will
be coordinating activities across three laboratories at two institutions (University of Texas Medical Branch at
Galveston and Texas A&M University in College Station) and ensuring that the overall goal of the Center, which
is “to translate a comprehensive set of MPS aimed at replicating all aspects of human female reproductive organs
involved in pregnancy into drug development tools that are qualified for regulatory decision-making,” is met. The
Core is organized around four key functions that will enable it to be an effective and nimble coordinator of the
proposed research, outreach, training, and translation activities: (1) administration and fiscal management, (2)
research integration, (3) quality control and quality assurance, and (4) research translation and
commercialization. The Core will be physically located within the Division of Basic Science and Translational
Research in the Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology at UTMB. The overall PI, Dr. Menon is director of the
Division, and he will be assisted in the Core by TAMU MPIs, Drs. Rusyn and Han; together, three MPIs will form
a Steering Committee that will oversee all functions of the Core and the Center. The MPIs have extensive
experience working together through joint funding, publications, and co-mentoring of trainees. Other personnel
in the Core include Center Manager and Quality Assurance/Quality Control Manager. The overall strategy used
by the Administrative Core for achieving success will consist of: (i) regular Center-wide and inter-core
interactions; (ii) monthly tracking of the products of the Center’s work (preparation of the resources, delivery of
the resources to the QC, completed qualification experiments, qualification package submissions to the FDA,
and interactions with stakeholders); and (iii) coordinating research translation. The Core’s work is organized
around five Specific Aims. First, the Core will provide effective administrative and fiscal management. The Core
will conduct program planning and evaluation and assessment of Center performance. Second, the Core will
facilitate integration of cutting-edge research, qualification, and regulatory science activities. Third, the Core will
establish and maintain quality assurance and control protocols for both resources, experiments, and data to
ensure rigor and reproducibility in research and to maintain FAIR data management system through integration
with the MPS Database. Fourth, the Core will promote dissemination of the Center’s knowledge to other
academic researchers, government agencies, and the industry end-users. Finally, the Core will advance the
practical application of the Center-qualified MPS as drug development tools through technology transfer and
commercialization. All Center faculty and staff will interact with the Core as it executes its Administration,
Integration, Quality Assurance/Quality Control, and Technology Transfer & Commercialization functions."
10816255,"RESOURCES CORE ABSTRACT
The Resources Core will be the “trusted provider” part of the proposed Translational Center for
Microphysiological Systems-Based Drug Development Tools for Pregnancy and Women's Health. The vision of
the Center is to overcome existing limitations and challenges in pre-clinical and clinical testing of drug candidates
for pregnant women. The goal of the Resources Core is to provide high-quality MPS devices and cells to the
Qualification Core so that the Qualification Core can successfully conduct drug testing that can lead to qualifying
the MPS devices, with the ultimate goal of facilitating widespread use of the MPS devices as drug development
tools for pregnancy and women’s health. The microfabrication part of the Core will be at Texas A&M University,
whereas the cell part of the Core will be at UTMB. The two laboratories have been working together for the past
5+ years in developing the five feto-maternal organ MPS devices to be used here, namely the chorio-decidual
interface (CD-OOC), the placental-endothelial interface (PLA-OOC), the decidual-Fetal membrane
interface (FMi-OOC), the multi-organ feto-maternal interface (FMi-PLA-OOC), and the vagina-cervix-decidua
interface (VCD-OOC). All cell lines, mostly derived from primary cells, have also been established and well
validated. The two laboratories have already been exchanging all MPS devices as well as cells, along with usage
protocols, thus are well experienced in providing the needed devices and cells mutually. Importantly, the two
laboratories have also provided the MPS devices and cells to the Rusyn Lab that is leading the Qualification
Core. Thus, all parties involved in the Center are already working together closely and collaborating. The Core’s
work will be organized around three Specific Aims. First, the Core will microfabricate and prepare the MPS
systems in sufficient quantities for the Qualification Core to conduct drug testing. Second, the Core will provide
enough authenticated cells to the Qualification Core. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) for microfabrication
and quality control (QC), cell maintenance, as well as MPS device operation and testing will be developed and
provided as well. These SOPs will be optimized to provide MPS devices and cells that are highly reproducible
with minimum device-to-device and batch-to-batch variations. Importantly, key MPS readouts from the four drugs
to be tested using the MPS devices will be generated, serving as baseline data for the Qualification Core that
will conduct the in-depth testing of the four drugs on the MPS devices. All MPS devices to be provided to the
Qualification Core will strictly follow these SOPs, and only devices and cells that pass the QC matrix will be
provided. Finally, a clear pathway towards large-scale deployment and/or commercialization of the MPS devices
will be developed so that the qualified MPS devices can be provided to the broad stakeholders in a sustainable
manner. The impact of this work will be contributing to multiple MPSs related to women’s health and pregnancy
to be qualified for various contexts of use, especially for drug testing, and can increase the confidence for MPS
devices to replace unreliable animal or single culture models."
10816256,"QUALIFICATION CORE ABSTRACT
The Qualification Core is the “trust but verify” part of the proposed Translational Center for Microphysiological
Systems-Based Drug Development Tools for Pregnancy and Women's Health. The vision of the Center is to
overcome existing limitations and challenges in pre-clinical and clinical testing of drug candidates for pregnant
women. The goal of the Qualification Core is to facilitate commercialization and widespread use of the MPS for
pregnancy and women’s health as drug development tools. The Core will be based at Texas A&M University; it
is a direct extension of the TEX-VAL Tissue Chip Testing Center (funded by NCATS 2016-2020) that has since
evolved into a self-sustained university-based private-public partnership – TEX-VAL Consortium. The latter is
funded through annual fees by a diverse set of stakeholders (Sanofi, Merck Healthcare, Bristol Myers Squibb,
Roche, Unilever, American Chemistry Council, US EPA and the National Toxicology Program). Since 2016, TEX-
VAL tested over 30 MPS from both academia and companies. TEX-VAL experience with careful evaluation of
diverse MPS and promoting their use by the industry and regulators is the foundation of the Qualification Core
and a unique strength of the Center. The Core’s faculty and staff have experience in toxicology, regulatory
science, validation of alternative methods, and all proposed assays and PBPK modeling. The Core’s work will
be organized around three Specific Aims. First, the Core will establish functionality, reproducibility, robustness,
and reliability of 5 MPS platforms as drug development tools for pregnancy and women's health. By focusing on
key feto-maternal tissues supporting pregnancy (placenta, fetal membranes, decidua, and cervix), we will enable
recapitulation of pregnancy-associated physiological barriers. We will be testing 4 compounds (3 small molecules
to 1 biological) in one of the 5 MPS models each year. We selected Aspirin, Celecoxib, Sofosbuvir and exosome-
encapsulated IL-10 as candidates for drug repurposing in pregnant women. The proposed qualification contexts
of use are: (i) to characterize human-relevant pharmacokinetic profile of a drug during pregnancy, including
information on drug amounts in different intra-uterine tissue compartments (both maternal and fetal), and inter-
individual variability; and (ii) to evaluate potential human-relevant toxic (pharmacodynamic) effects of a drug on
intra-uterine tissues during pregnancy. Each round of testing will be based on the scientific confidence framework
as published in 2023 by the National Academies and will use a standardized workflow consisting of material
transfer, testing of cell seeding and drug binding, replication of the data from the Resources Core, and deposition
of data/protocols to the MPS Database and preparation of FDA ISTAND qualification packages. Second, the
Core will manage and assure quality of the data that will be derived from testing reference compounds by
following a strict quality management process and annual audits. Finally, the Core will promote wide adoption of
tested MPS through research translation in a three-pronged approach: (i) “direct marketing” to prospective end-
users, (ii) full data/protocol transparency via MPS Database submissions; and (iii) FDA ISTAND qualification."
10816270,"Realizing Accelerated Progress, Investigation, Implementation, and Dissemination
 in Learning Health Systems (RAPID-LHS)
Major gaps exist between the generation of clinical evidence, widespread implementation of proven
interventions, and formulation of informed policy. The learning health system (LHS) aims “to generate and
apply the best evidence for the collaborative healthcare choices of each patient and provider; to drive the
process of discovery as a natural outgrowth of patient care; and to ensure innovation, quality, safety, and value
in healthcare.” Vanderbilt will formally train a cadre of RAPID-LHS scientists well versed in the best methods
for integrating patient-centered outcomes, evidence implementation, and evaluation of health policies within
the LHS. We propose to establish the Realizing Accelerated Progress, Investigation, Implementation, and
Dissemination in Learning Health Systems (RAPID-LHS) Center to train faculty to conduct high-impact
research that is embedded in the LHS. In cross-training scientists and embedding them in the health system,
we will draw together scientists and mentors across disciplines and model the team science integral to LHS.
We will provide forums that demonstrate the intellectual productivity and practical benefits of interdisciplinary
research in advancing human health. We endorse team approaches to filling gaps in knowledge and
translating knowledge into application. A diverse pool of scientists from internal (Vanderbilt University
Medical Center) and partner health systems (Meharry Medical College, the VA Quality Scholars Program,
Vanderbilt University, Vanderbilt Health Affiliated Network, Safety Net Clinics, and the STAR Clinical Research
network) is available. Career milestones for scientists will include impact on health equity, population health
and patient health, publications and grants. LHS lessons learned during project development will advance LHS
science.
All RAPID-LHS scientists will conduct embedded projects in conjunction with Research and Data Analysis
Core (RDAC), focusing on 1) patient-centered outcomes research, 2) dissemination and implementation
science, 3) health policy/public health, 4) stakeholder engagement and health equity, and 5) methods
advancement. Each embedded project will begin with in-depth feedback from a Community Engagement
Studio and LHS Platform Studio, which will follow a structured process to ensure that the clinical question is
important and that the research is needed. All scientists will then meet with RDAC mentors to determine their
needs and prepare a structured workplan. The research will use a health equity lens to prevent unintended
consequences of interventions in the health system. Each scientist will engage in integrated didactic and
experiential training through the Research Education Core. The RAPID-LHS scientists’ progress will be
facilitated by VUMC’s rich environment for training in LHS and supporting projects with real-world impact."
10815714,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Upon diagnosis of hearing loss, parents/caregivers of children who are deaf/hard-of-hearing (DHH) make
decisions around numerous approaches to language and communication development. Despite strong efforts
to improve long-term outcomes, DHH children continue to fall short of age-appropriate language levels, placing
them at risk for reduced academic achievement, behavioral problems, and poor social abilities that persist into
adulthood. The lack of research supporting innovative intervention strategies leaves a gaping hole in our
ability to fully support DHH children. Thus, we are unable to provide families with the quality information
regarding intervention options. Evidence supports augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) for
enhancing language development, yet technology-based AAC has not been applied or effectively studied in
DHH children. To address the substantial and pervasive language deficits among DHH children that have
persisted despite advances in amplification technology and early identification, we designed a technology-assisted language intervention (TALI) that incorporates high-tech AAC into speech-language therapy as a
language teaching tool specifically adapted for DHH children. Our central hypothesis is that DHH children who
participate in the TALI will have greater gains in spoken language outcomes compared to DHH children who
receive treatment-as-usual (TAU) speech-language therapy. In a small randomized trial to test the
effectiveness of the TALI, our preliminary data show that the TALI significantly improves spoken language
outcomes for DHH children and is more effective than TAU. However, there remains a need to (a) provide
evidence for reproducibility and generalizability in a larger population and (b) understand the TALI
effectiveness on additional language outcome measures. We propose a randomized controlled trial of 114
DHH children at 2 recruitment sites (Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center and Children’s Hospital of
Colorado). Children will be randomized to either receive 24 weeks of the TALI or 24 weeks TAU therapy. We
will expand our current work to include additional language outcomes, creating a more complete picture of the
effectiveness of the proposed intervention. We will test our central hypothesis through the following specific
aims: (1) Compare spoken (expressive) language outcomes in DHH children and participating in the TALI with
those participating in TAU therapy; (2) Compare language outcomes measured on standardized assessments
between children who are DHH participating in the TALI with those participating in TAU; (3) Evaluate whether
the benefits of the TALI on language outcomes is maintained 6 months post-intervention. Primary outcomes
include syntax, semantics and discourse collected from language samples measured every 6 weeks and
receptive/expressive standardized language scores measured pre and post intervention. AAC use will be
monitored to measure adherence to the TALI while at home. This project directly aligns with NIDCD’s strategic
plan’s overarching goal of improving outcomes in human communication."
10815717,"Project Abstract
 Non-polio human enteroviruses (NPEVs) represent an existing and emerging threat to public health, especially
to infants and children. With more than 100 NPEVs known and the high rate of mutation and recombination of
these viruses, the risk for evolution of virulent strains is high. Because we cannot predict the serotype of any
newly emerging strain, addressing this problem effectively will require pan-enterovirus solutions. All NPEVs
encode an enzyme, which has been termed 2C. This enzyme is as well conserved as the enterovirus RNA-
dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Indeed, inhibitors of 2C with activity against multiple enteroviruses have
been known for decades, with even more reported over the past few years alone. A major obstacle to further
development of these compounds is the absence of an established experimental framework to define mechanism
of action and to guide design of pan-enterovirus activity.
 Two of the earliest inhibitors of 2C: guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl); and 5-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-
methylhydantoin (hydantoin), revealed roles for 2C both in genome replication and virion assembly. Because 2C
protein is a member of helicase superfamily 3, the prevailing view has been that 2C is a hexameric helicase that
cooperates with RdRp by unwinding RNA structure during genome replication and by facilitating genome
encapsidation during virion assembly. Unfortunately, only indirect evidence exists to support these views.
 Nearly five years ago, our laboratory initiated an effort to connect the biochemical and biophysical properties
of 2C to its biological functions using poliovirus (PV) as our model. The advances made to date, all unpublished,
have changed the way we think about structure-dynamics-function relationships of 2C, the subcellular locations
in which 2C manifests its virion-assembly function, and the physical properties of the virus-induced membranes
with which 2C must interact during infection.
 In this application, we propose to add Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71), Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), and Enterovirus
D68 (EV-D68) to our studies of PV to establish unifying models for the biological functions of 2C that will provide
a framework to establish 2C as a pan-enterovirus therapeutic target. We will do so by pursuing the following
specific aims: Elucidate the quaternary structure and kinetic mechanism of 2C ATPase (Aim 1); Elucidate the
impact of drug resistance on 2C ATPase activity and viral fitness (Aim 2), and Characterize sites contributing to
genome encapsidation (Aim 3)."

Despite substantial advancements in small-molecule catalysis, general methods to control the stereoselectivity
in radical-mediated transformations remain a formidable challenge facing synthetic chemists. On the other hand,
enzymes are known for their ability to exert exquisite control over the stereochemical outcome of the reactions
they catalyze. However, the catalytic repertoire of enzymes has been largely limited to their native biochemistry.
Using an interdisciplinary approach combining ideas and technologies from organic chemistry, organometallic
chemistry, biocatalysis, enzyme engineering and computational modeling, we will reprogram naturally occurring
metalloenzymes to catalyze unnatural radical reactions with excellent stereoselectivity. Capitalizing on the innate
redox property of metallocofactor present in a plethora of natural metalloproteins, we will develop metalloredox
radical biocatalytic reactions with significant synthetic utility. First, we will develop new-to-nature metalloredox
atom transfer radical addition reactions that proceed with excellent diastereo- and enantiocontrol. Second, we
will advance stereoselective radical additions to aromatic compounds in a metalloenzyme-controlled fashion.
Furthermore, enantioselective C-H functionalization reactions involving metalloenzymatically formed nitrogen-
centered radicals will be developed. All the three aims are supported by strong preliminary data gathered in our
laboratory. Together, these novel metalloredox biocatalytic processes constitute a powerful toolbox for the rapid
assembly of diverse bioactive small molecules that are highly valuable in biomedical sciences. Furthermore, the
development of new-to-nature catalytic functions will dramatically broaden the biochemical landscape of
metalloenzymes."

 We propose to develop and evaluate optimal combinations of evidence-based interventions (EBIs) to
improve HIV outcomes and reduce methamphetamine use among people with opioid use disorder (OUD) who
are in methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) in Vietnam (STAR-OM study). Over the past decade, the
expansion of MMT has contributed to stemming both HIV and opioid epidemics. However, rising
methamphetamine use threatens these achievements. The twinned epidemics of opioid and
methamphetamine use have also been reported in the US and other countries. Building on our pilot work with
MMT patients in Hanoi, through collaborative work with local MMT providers and patients, we will refine
adapted EBIs to develop an adaptive design that offers an individualized approach to treatment. The adaptive
design includes: (1) Two frontline interventions: 6 weeks of CM then 6 weeks of weekly group educational
sessions (low intensity CM) and 12 weeks of CM (high intensity CM); (2) One (short-term) tailoring outcome:
urine tests negative with meth metabolites in both week 11 and 12 are considered responsive to frontline
interventions; (3) Three alternative interventions: those with positive outcomes will move to 12-week
maintenance stage and receive two daily SMS reminders plus one weekly self-monitoring assessment
message. Non-responders will move to 12-week enhanced treatment stage and are randomized to either
Matrix group counseling only or Matrix group counseling plus CM. We will compare effectiveness of two
frontline interventions and four adaptive interventions with a Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomization
Trial in 200 HIV+ (150 from HCMC; 50 from Hanoi) and 400 HIV- (200 from each city) MMT patients who
report moderate- and high-risk meth use on self-screening with tablet-based ASSIST and/or have urine
positive with methamphetamine metabolites. In each location, the study will stratify participants by HIV status
before randomizing them to one of two frontline interventions. Primary outcomes - including HIV viral
suppression, HIV risk behaviors, and meth use (reported and urine tests) - will be assessed at 12, 24 and 48
weeks. We will calculate the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) comparing cost-effectiveness between
two frontline interventions as well as among four adaptive strategies. Finally yet importantly, we also conduct
ethnographic observations and in-depth interviews with MMT clinic managers, clinical staff and MMT patients
(N=60, 30 per city) to identify structural, provider and patient-level factors that influence adoption and scale-up
of the adaptive interventions. Findings from this study with Type I Hybrid design to evaluate
EFFECTIVENESS-Implementation will provide valuable evidence to develop treatments in resourced and
resourced-constrained settings to confront the twinned epidemics of opioid and methamphetamine use in the
context of surging HIV epidemic due to drug abuse."
10817262,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Administrative Core
The Administrative Core (Admin-Core) has established an organizational structure that serves the mission of
the UC Davis Environmental Health Sciences Core Center (EHSC): to advance understanding of
environmentally-induced disease and disability and to develop interventions that reduce hazardous exposures
or lessen their effects on health. This Core supports each of the other Cores, the Advisory groups, and the
Working Groups; provides resources for all EHSC members to capitalize on emerging opportunities; and
enables Center Leaders to effectively guide the EHSC towards greater impact through its research, community
engagement, and translational efforts.
In fewer than 4 years, this Core provided administrative support to successfully integrate previously disparate
clusters of investigators working on exposure science, toxicology, disease mechanisms, epidemiology and
environmental justice into a cohesive group that collectively is pursuing a wide range of new collaborations and
generating cutting edge science. The Admin-Core was instrumental in the launch of a robust research
response to wildfires in California; recruitment of over a dozen investigators new to EHS through coordination
and campus-wide publicizing of the pilot project program; and integration of community stakeholders and their
concerns in our annual retreats and discussion of priorities. In the next funding period, the Admin-Core will
provide services in four areas: 1) Management of fiscal operations, documentation and evaluation of activities,
compliance, and progress, and scientific leadership for decision-making and priority-setting to govern the
overall direction of the Center, new research initiatives and translational projects. 2) Career development,
including a monthly critical review of Specific Aims for any environmental health-related grant application, an
EHS Scholar award, a course in program management and leadership, and structured mentoring for pilot
award recipients who are early stage investigators or established investigators new to EHS. 3) Coordination of
research infrastructure and translation: by promoting/supporting interdisciplinary collaborations, Working
Groups, cross-Core interactions, disaster research response, and engagement with other UCD Centers; and
by working in concert with the Community Engagement Core and community stakeholders on moving EHS
research into policy interventions and public health practices. 4) Communications: internally to all members
and to Center leaders of the Cores and Working Groups to enhance integration, participation and our sense of
purpose, and externally to amplify visibility of the EHSC, including to UCD Administrators, Advisory bodies,
funding agencies, other Core Centers, government and policy-makers, and to stakeholders and the broad
public through events, social media, traditional outlets, website, film, and others. The Admin-Core will continue
to grow the EHSC’s capacity to address pressing environmental health issues; accelerate translation of results
into policies and practices that improve public health; and work towards long-term sustainability."

into innovative intervention and human studies, our leadership and research capacity of this core has
expanded. Overall, access to critical resources will be provided by the UC Davis Environmental Health
Sciences Core Center (EHSCC) IHSFC for in vitro studies, animal models, biostatistics, novel sensor and
biomarker technologies, and translational research resources for human studies and disaster response
research. Specifically, our aims are to 1) promote EHSCC research projects along the translational research
pipeline using in vitro assays, in vivo experimental larval fish, rodent and non-human primate models, and
epidemiology and human studies, 2) provide biostatistical consultation and study design expertise to new and
established environmental health researchers, 3) develop and implement new tools and technologies for
environmental health sciences research, and 4) establish a UC Davis Environmental Health Sciences Rapid
Response team that can mobilize quickly to immediately engage populations affected by environmental
disasters, e.g. wildfires. These resources are critical for the center to achieve its overarching goal to deepen
our understanding of how environmental exposures affect human health and, thus, the IHSFC will play a vital
role in bringing EHS-related research at UC Davis to applications and interventions that reduce disease and
disability, and promoting environmental public health both in our targeted region of California’s Northern and
Central Valley, and throughout the world."
10817264,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Exposure Core 
A robust exposure assessment is key to the success of any environmental epidemiology or toxicology project 
and determining exposure can be complex as people are exposed to multiple compounds through multiple 
exposure pathways. During the initial funding period, the Exposure Core has become a well-known hub on 
campus for seeking advice on the exposure related portion of study design and for developing new and helpful 
methods and facilities to further environmental health research. The Exposure Core has helped connect 
investigators with analytical laboratories that can help further their exposure characterization, assisted 
epidemiologists with robust exposure assessment design, and aided toxicologists to quantify exposures and 
relate them to a relevant benchmark or tissue level. For multi-chemical scenarios, The Core has helped ensure 
that laboratory exposures model real-world human exposure scenarios. The overarching goal of the Exposure 
Core is to provide comprehensive exposure study design and analysis expertise to improve the quality of 
studies that require exposure assessment for epidemiological studies and exposure environments for 
toxicological studies, and hence improve the quality of environmental health research conducted at UC Davis. 
Exposure Core laboratories include expertise in: 1) target and non-target analysis of organic compounds in 
environmental and biological samples, 2) time-integrated or time-window specific exposure concentrations, 3) 
compositional analysis of environmental samples to identify organic functionality via FTIR and mass 
spectrometry and elements and isotopes via XRF and ICPMS analysis, 4) design guidance for animal 
inhalation toxicology studies from a range of air pollutants and sources, 5) resources for helping environmental 
justice communities determine potential exposures, an exposure vivarium for traffic related airborne particles, 
and 5) a portable wildfire measurement system. Core members continue to expand the capabilities of their labs 
to meet these growing needs of center members. The core is increasing our capabilities in helping faculty 
working with community groups to evaluate compounds of concern and develop streamlined methods for 
evaluating community exposures. The Exposure Core has developed a program to provide seed funding to 
investigators for method development to build capabilities. The Exposure Core also provides both subsidies 
and seed funding for sample analysis in the core laboratories for center members. We provide advice on the 
study design through Specific Aims Reviews hosted by the Administrative Core, through Exposure Design 
Reviews for potential pilot applicants, and through meetings with investigators. By providing exposure 
assessment expertise to investigators as part of an integrated core, rather than via independent campus 
laboratories, we will be able to provide a much more robust, appropriate, and custom tailored exposure 
assessment through our synergies, interactions and collaborations."
10817265,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Community Engagement Core
The Community Engagement Core (CEC) will foster a culture of collaboration among environmental health
scientists, community organizations, environmental justice experts and environmental health-related public
agencies to create and sustain multi-directional partnerships for environmental health research that are
responsive to the environmental health needs and concerns of the most vulnerable communities in California's
Central Valley. This region, considered to have the most productive agricultural industry in the country, also
leads the nation in areas of concentrated poverty, environmental contamination, and poor environmental health
conditions. Building from a foundation of strong community partnerships developed in the last four years, the
CEC’s activities for the next cycle will include: 1) building greater Community Stakeholder Advisory Committee
(CSTAC) leadership into CEC and EHSCC activities; 2) expanding, modifying, and refining trainings from the
last cycle in order to reach a wider audience and continue strengthening individual community-engaged
research partnerships; 3) developing innovative and impactful communication strategies that increase
environmental health literacy, empower communities to understand and use science, and drive the translation
of EHSCC research into policy change and other health-protective action; and, 4) evaluating the efficacy of
CEC programs for continuous improvement and contribution to the scholarship of community engagement. The
CEC will interact with all programs and cores within the EHSCC, serving to connect EHSCC leadership and
investigators to the interests and needs of disadvantaged communities in the Central Valley. Integration with
the Pilot Project Program will focus upon developing community-responsive pilot projects, for which the CEC
and CSTAC co-chairs will serve as proposal reviewers and the CEC will provide continuous support to pilot
investigators throughout their projects. The CEC and Administrative Core will work together to plan and
coordinate CEC/CSTAC directed events, produce and disseminate outreach materials, and coordinate
engagement between the EHSCC and non-academic stakeholders. Integration with the Integrated Health
Sciences Facility Core (IHSFC) and Exposure Core will be enhanced by new topic-specific working groups;
CSTAC member participation on these working groups will create opportunities to identify potential community
engagement and research-to-policy activities."
10817266,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Pilot Projects Program
The overall goal of the Pilot Project Program (PPP) is to expand the UC Davis research base in
environmental health sciences (EHS) and to attract new or established investigators to turn their attention to
environmental health problems. The PPP will promote EHS research through provision of research funding,
promotion of Core resource usage, intellectual support and integration within the Center as well as with other
programs at UC Davis. Research funds are expected to jumpstart new research endeavors focused on
environmental health, through feasibility investigation, collection of preliminary data, establishment of proof of
principle or small studies that are consistent with the broad mission and scientific themes of the
Environmental Health Sciences Core Center (EHSCC), and especially with translational potential, and to hold
promise of generating new resources. This Program will emphasize support for junior investigators, as well as
those investigators new to environmental health or exploring substantially new research directions and whose
research brings an innovative viewpoint to the study of environmental health with relevance to human
conditions. Support will also be provided to established EHS researchers exploring new directions. Available
funds for the PPP were, and continue to be, greatly enhanced through partnerships with other programs,
centers and departments. The PPP process involves: 1) issuing a request for proposals, 2) reviewing pre-
proposals, 3) referring applicants to Facility Core Design Clinics for guidance, 4) finding reviewers, and 5)
reviewing proposals for both scientific and programmatic merit, with final funding decisions made by the
Center Leadership Group and Stakeholder Representative. The PPP’s specific objectives are to: (a)
provide support for junior investigators and/or established researchers new to EHS to develop a research
program in EHS; (b) facilitate exploration of innovative new directions to advance EHS research; (c) develop
resources, approaches, or technology that benefit EHS research for multiple center members; (d) promote
interdisciplinary research; and (e) promote community engagement and translational research. The
significance of this is underscored by the need to support and promote the careers of junior faculty as well as
to expand research that employs conceptual or technological innovations or that has translational benefit for
community stakeholders."
10817248,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, is endemic in Latin America but cases are
increasing in non-endemic countries, becoming a global concern. It affects 6 million people and imposes a
major economic burden due to early mortality and physical disabilities. Disease progression, from symptomless
to severe, is linked to parasite heterogeneity and a variable host immune response. Development of robust
CD8+ T cell immunity is a key element of host resistance and T. cruzi persistence and chronic Chagas disease
has been associated to suboptimal CD8+ T cell responses. Despite this, the knowledge about pathways that
promote robust protective CD8+ T cell immunity to T. cruzi remains incomplete and for instance, the metabolic
hurdles faced by effector CD8+ T cells for expansion and differentiation have been barely explored. Also, the
progression of T. cruzi infection is thought to be significantly modulated by regulatory immune responses that
limit parasite-specific immunity as well as infection-associated immunopathology by mechanisms poorly
understood. In this context, defining how effector and regulatory pathways intertwined to allow the generation
of optimal cellular immunity against T. cruzi preserving of tissue homeostasis is crucial to understand Chagas
disease pathogenesis. In this direction, our published data showed that Treg cells became activated during T.
cruzi infection and acquired phenotypic attributes that markedly changed along the infection. Thus, Treg cells
acquired features linked to the regulation of type 1 responses and limited CD8+ T cell immunity during the
infection acute phase, likely delaying parasite control and favoring chronicity. In contrast, preliminary data
demonstrate that Treg cells with tissue repair ties, which were disfavored during the acute phase, accumulated
during the chronic phase in nonlymphoid tissues considered targets of T. cruzi and reduced tissue damage.
Altogether, our findings highlight numerous changes in the phenotypic and functional profile as well as main
location of specialized Treg cells in the transition from acute to chronic phase, suggesting that Treg cell roles
switch from deleterious to protective in the course of this infection. A comprehensive characterization of
phenotype, function and transcriptional program of Treg cells in different tissues, together with the
manipulation of this regulatory subset by different strategies will allow us to define the mechanisms underlying
Treg cell mediated regulation of effector immunity and immunopathology in acute and chronic experimental T.
cruzi infection. These approaches will guide our evaluation of effector and regulatory pathways and their
association to the clinical severity in samples of patients with chronic Chagas disease in order to translate our
finding to human health. Altogether, our studies will provide meaningful data about different interacting
pathways and, possibly, new mediators that participate in the regulation of effector cellular immunity to T. cruzi
and the development of chronic pathology. This information will identify potential new targets for the rational
design of therapies for Chagas´ disease and, likely, other chronic infections."

10817109,"Despite the absence of organelles, bacteria exhibit an intricate subcellular organization
that is required for cells to grow, divide and replicate. A key question is how do simple bacteria
go beyond bags of molecules to spatially and temporally organize physiological processes
needed to sustain life and regulate development? It has been shown that bacteria achieve
subcellular organization using microcompartments, curvature sensing, nucleoid occlusion, and
unique lipid and peptidoglycan composition at the cell poles. Liquid-phase separated droplets,
termed biomolecular condensates, spatially organize biochemical pathways as membraneless
organelles in eukaryotes including P-bodies and stress granules. In collaboration with Jared
Schrader's lab, we discovered that ribonuclease Rnase E forms liquid-phase separated
bacterial ribonucleoprotein bodies (BR-bodies) that share similarities with P-bodies and stress
granules. In this proposal we investigate: 1) the mechanisms that promote Rnase E BR-body
formation, 2) mechanisms that regulate selective permeability of BR-bodies to messenger RNA
over non-coding RNAs, and 3) the role of Rnase E scaffolding and biomolecular condensation
upon mRNA decay. Our studies of BR-bodies will likely provide an illuminating initial example of
biomolecular condensates as central organizers of biochemistry within bacteria, and reveal new
modes of genetic regulation. This new understanding of mRNA decay should also reveal new
insights into regulatory processes that govern bacterial virulence pathways and identify potential
antibiotic strategies that disrupt BR-body functions."

This is a renewal application for a T35 summer medical student training program in vision research with
two Specific Aims: 1) To provide hands-on training in basic and clinical vision research to medical
students in a structured mentored environment and 2) To provide an interactive, educational experience
that introduces medical students the fundamental skills necessary for basic, translational, and clinical
research in vision biology. The co-directors of this program request support for 8 second-year medical
students each summer in vision related research laboratories that focus on topics such as visual
circuitry, retinal degeneration, corneal epithelial homeostasis, uveitis, ocular drug discovery, and
development of the visual system. Trainees will be selected from the first-year class at University of
Louisville School of Medicine. Students will review research projects submitted by 18 faculty funded by
the NEI or vision related foundations. The directors will make a special effort to recruit students who are
underrepresented in science, including females, ethnic minorities and from disadvantaged
backgrounds. Students will review the available projects and rank their 1st-5th choices, allowing matching
of trainees with mentors. Final decisions will be made based on interviews between mentors and
Trainees. During the 10-week summer training, students work with mentors on their research project in
laboratory settings, complete training in the Responsible Conduct of Research including topics such as
fabrication and falsification of data, plagiarism, managing scientific data, publication practices and
responsible authorship, mentorship, stewardship, and conflict of interest. Trainees will complete human
subject, IRB training, and animal care and handling as required by their specific research projects. All
Trainees will attend a 2-hour weekly “Vision Sciences Research Training Seminar” designed to
introduce clinical/translational research in Ophthalmology led by mentors in this T35 program. The
seminar series will culminate with each Trainee presenting his/her research project to peers and
mentors. In addition, trainees present the results of their research as posters with peers at a School of
Medicine-wide, week-long celebration of research (Research!Louisville) that includes nationally
recognized physician-scientists as keynote speakers. Trainees will be encouraged to continue research
as part of the Distinction in Research track that is an enrichment program focusing on providing
meaningful and productive research experiences throughout second through fourth years of medical
school, with ongoing presentations by students with mentors and 4+ weeks of research time in the
fourth year toward the goal of developing clinician-researchers. Trainees will be tracked to assess the

10817115,"Abstract
Fewer than half of all children with high-risk neuroblastoma become long-term survivors. Currently, it is not
possible to predict if a child will be cured with standard therapy or is destined to relapse. Furthermore, standard
clinical evaluations lack sensitivity to detect minimal residual disease (MRD) that ultimately leads to recurrence.
Thus, there is a critical challenge and an unmet need to develop new precision biomarkers to identify patients
who will ultimately have a poor response to the high-intensity therapy and may benefit from alternate approaches.
We will develop new biomarkers to guide treatment decisions using cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and a novel,
epigenetic-based methodology that will identify underlying biology driving aggressive neuroblastoma. In many
cancer types, analysis of cfDNA isolated from peripheral blood has shown promise, revealing biomarkers for
diagnosis, prognostication, and tumor surveillance. Cytosines in DNA can either be unmodified, methylated (5-
methylcytosine, 5mC), or contain an oxidized form of 5mC, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). Unlike 5mC,
elevated 5hmC deposition across a gene body marks active transcription. In this proposal, we will use nano-
hmC-seal, a whole-genome methodology for analyzing 5hmC modifications in cfDNA. Recently, we evaluated
5hmC in cfDNA collected serially from children with neuroblastoma and demonstrated that 5hmC profiles
correlated with disease burden and patient outcome. Importantly, we also found a cfDNA 5hmC derived
biomarker can distinguish patients with superior response to treatment from those at high risk for relapse. 5hmC
profiles from cfDNA compared to diagnostic high-risk primary tumors demonstrated cfDNA is derived from
clinically aggressive, malignant cells with activation of networks common in relapsed tumors. To prospectively
determine the prognostic strength of 5hmC-based cfDNA biomarkers, we will use nano-hmC-seal to generate
5hmC profiles from clinically annotated serial blood samples (liquid biopsies) collected from 400 patients enrolled
on the ongoing Children’s Oncology Group High-Risk Neuroblastoma Phase III study (ANBL1531,
NCT03126916). We hypothesize that cfDNA 5hmC profiles from children with neuroblastoma will serve as
superior biomarkers for response and survival compared to current clinical methods and will reveal transcriptional
networks driving relapse. The specific aims are: 1) Evolve and validate biomarkers of poor response at diagnosis;
2) Prospectively identify minimal residual disease (MRD) and predict relapse from serial cfDNA 5hmC profiles;
3) Experimentally confirm candidate networks enriched in cfDNA at relapse. The success of this proposal will
lead to: 1) unprecedented diagnostic biomarkers to improve therapeutic decisions; 2) early detection and
interventions for patients with relapse causing MRD; 3) identification of epigenetic mechanisms which drive
relapse. This work will have a transformative impact by to identifying patients who benefit from early introduction
of alternate therapy, improving outcomes for those with aggressive disease."

The Exposure Biology Informatics Core (EBIC) is dedicated to providing informatics support to CEET 
investigators in the areas of chemoinformatics resource management and analysis, bioinformatics application 
development, multi-omics data management and integration, next-generation sequencing (NGS) data analysis, 
biomedical informatics to extract data from the Electronic Health Record (EHR), computer programming, 
artificial intelligence and machine learning, and data visualization. For this purpose, we have assembled a 
diverse team of experts with complementary skills in computer science, data science, and genomics to build a 
powerful informatics infrastructure that is prepared for biomedical and environmental big-data. The vision for 
EBIC is to provide seamless support for routine use of innovative computational methods that embrace the 
complexity of exposure biology and environmental health and enable the conversion of big-data into knowledge 
to advance Precision Public Health (PPH). A central goal of the EBIC is to work closely with CEET investigators 
in both a collaborative and support role to understand adverse outcome pathways (AOP) or constructs that go 
from the exposure to molecular initiating events to downstream key events to organism and population health 
outcomes. The primary objectives of the EBIC are organized around eight specific aims. In Aim 1: we will provide 
state-of-art informatics services to research groups that otherwise would not have access to these computational 
approaches. In Aim 2: We will support the CEET thematic areas in Air Pollution & Lung Health, Environmental

The Community Engagement Core (CEC) supports the mission of the CEET by engaging stakeholders to identify
environmental health problems and address them collaboratively. Translation of ongoing Center environmental
health research to community stakeholders and communication of environmental health research needs from
community stakeholders back to CEET investigators is facilitated by the CEC’s strong collaborations with its
community stakeholders comprised of three major audiences: (a) target communities; (b) health care
professionals; and (c) policy and decision makers. Through our “Target Community Model” we first learn about
the spectrum of community problems and then address environmental health problems without imposing any
external agenda. Our regional focus is on the aging infrastructure of post-industrialized cities e.g. Philadelphia
and its surrounding rural communities in Pennsylvania. In our target communities we focus on identifying
vulnerable populations including children, the elderly and the disadvantaged to enable Precision Public Health
(PPH) approaches. The CEC actively facilitates Community Engaged Research (CER) and Community-Based
Participatory Research (CBPR). The CEC’s Stakeholder Advisory Board composed of CEET members and
community stakeholders prioritize research questions with a focus on our CEET’s thematic areas in which we
have considerable expertise, Air Pollution & Lung Health, Environmental Exposures & Cancer, Windows-of-
Susceptibility and Environmental Neuroscience. Research questions are often taken to the Integrative Health
Sciences Facility Core for input on study design. Our Target Communities Model allows for comprehensive
engagement to enhance the communication of environmental health information to improve public health. We
seek out and engage policy and decision makers by providing them with science to support improved public
health policy. As a result, we have promoted legislative changes in Philadelphia and Lancaster that will protect
children from lead exposure. We actively translate and disseminate research information through publication and
presentation to ensure that scientists, medical and health care professionals have the most current research
information. We have presented research information to local and national audiences. Our CEC leverages multi-
directional engagement regularly to expand the impact of our grant funding and promote active collaboration for
improved health outcomes. Through collaborations with other CEC’s, we have designed innovative community
engagement tools and worked on projects with national scope and impact."
10817784,"PILOT PROJECTS : ABSTRACT
The Pilot Project Program is a key-component of the Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology (CEET)
that builds capacity in environmental health sciences (EHS). The Pilot Project Program serves to support Early-
Stage Investigators (ESI) that are interested in pursuing EHS, and senior investigators who may be embarking
on EHS projects for the first-time. To assist in the pilot project application process, we run a grants-writing program
within the Career Development activities of the Administrative Core. The Pilot Projects available fall into four
categories: (a) Mentored Scientist Transition Award (MSTA) which is our primary mechanism of funding a ESI
(new recruits, clinician scientists, research track faculty) who need protected time through salary and research
support to establish their independent research programs; (b) an Opportunity Award open to all junior and senior
faculty who propose an innovative EHS project which is not ready for federal funding; (c) a “Rapid Response”
award to promote community engaged research or provide funds to a faculty member who urgently needs to
generate preliminary data for a EHS relevant grant application; and (d) Focus Research Awards to support
research in the thematic areas of the Center: Air pollution & Lung Health, Environmental Exposures & Cancer,
Windows-of-Susceptibility and Environmental Neuroscience with emphasis to support multi-investigator grant
applications. Applications receive high priority if they are likely to lead to extramural funding from NIEHS or
respond to a RFA on which NIEHS is a sponsor; and if they use one or more facility cores, the Integrative Health
Sciences Facility Core (IHSFC), the Translational Biomarker Core (TBC) and Exposure Biology Informatics Core
(EBIC). Pilot project awardees are invited back after 12 months of funding to present on their progress in the
CEET seminar series. Outcome metrics such as grant applications submitted, grants awarded, and publications
are updated on an annual basis to account for the significant lag-phase that can exist between the pilot project
award and these successful outcomes."
10820476,"ABSTRACT
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a devastating disease with a five-year survival rate below 10%.
Modern advances in chemotherapy and immunotherapy have yet to provide effective treatments. While
oncogenic mutations in Kras are nearly universal in PDA, to date Kras remains undruggable. Clearly, new
strategies are needed to develop more effective strategies to improve outcomes for patients with PDA.
Metabolic pathways utilized by PDA cells present attractive targets to exploit therapeutically. The cells in a
pancreatic tumor are nutrient-deprived and persist in a hypoxic environment. High intratumoral pressure
caused by excessive extracellular matrix deposition from the cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) prevents
proper vascularization, nutrient delivery, and waste removal. Predictably, PDA cells hijack normal metabolic
pathways to meet the biosynthetic and energetic demands required to survive and proliferate. According to this
framework, several agents that target pancreatic tumor metabolism are being explored in clinical trials. However,
PDA cells also support their metabolic demands via interaction with non-malignant cells. Thus, strategies
targeting tumor metabolism must also take into consideration the role of the diverse cell types in the tumor
microenvironment.
Consistent with previous work, we observed that inhibition of mitochondrial metabolism is profoundly growth
inhibitory to PDA cells in culture. Yet, we more recently found that PDA tumors are resistant to mitochondrial-
targeted therapies in vivo. Through a series of biochemical and metabolomic co-culture studies, we found that
pancreatic CAFs promotes resistance to mitochondrial inhibition. We then identified pyruvate as the single
factor in CAF media that restored PDA cell proliferation upon mitochondrial inhibition. In this research proposal,
we will define how pyruvate is made and released by CAFs and how pyruvate is obtained and utilized by PDA
cells to promote resistance to mitochondrial inhibitors. We will also test the hypothesis that pyruvate release is
a CAF property engaged by signaling pathways promoted within pancreatic tumors. These studies will be
accomplished using metabolomics techniques in combination with inhibitors of metabolism and signal
transduction. In parallel, we will disrupt this pyruvate crosstalk pathway in human patient-derived organoid
models and in orthotopic transplant mouse models to determine the translation value. The application of
insights from these studies could have an immediate impact on patients, as mitochondrially-targeted therapies
are being tested in clinical trials for PDA and other cancers. A means to predict activity of mitochondrially-
targeted agents based on tumor CAF content or CAF properties would increase the utility of these agents."
10820479,"Perovskite Based Foldable and Sensitive X-ray Imaging Detectors for Trauma Care
Project Summary/Abstract
 X-ray imaging techniques including plain x-ray, tomosynthesis and computed tomography are the most
common and indispensable imaging modalities for screening and diagnosis. Trauma care needs the rapid
deployment of medical diagnostic devices and data collection to examine the injury of patient in complicated
environments, such as outside the hospitals or imaging-centers. Portable medical imaging devices such as X-
ray imaging devices are notably critical to address these needs. Since almost all present X-ray detectors are
made of the combination of scintillators with photodetector arrays, the portability of X-ray detectors is limited by
the rigid ceramic scintillators. Exposure to ionizing radiation is known to increase the risk of cancer due to the
damaging of DNA by X-ray. The current detectors are not sensitive enough so that a large dose is need to
achieve enough signal to noise ratio in imaging. The overall objective of this project is to yield a new generation
of X-ray detectors that are foldable, sensitive by overcoming the limitation of state-of-the-art detectors using
metal halide perovskites to directly convert X-ray into electrical signal. Direct conversion detectors have better
resolution than indirection ones, because it doesnot have the issue of nondirectional light emission in scintillators.
Perovskites are promising X-ray detection material by combining the strong stopping to X-ray and excellent
charge extraction capability. These detectors will be made to be like Yoga mats so that they can be folded for
easy carrying and quickly rolling-out or wrapping the point of care for inspection. A perovskite filled membrane
(PFM) structure will be used for multiple layer structure construction which have been demonstrated to have the
high sensitivity and easy to upscaled to large area for practical applications. Our specific objectives are: (Aim1)
establishing perovskite compositions, stacking structure and material fabrication process to develop sensitive
PFMs with large mobility-lifetime product, low noise, and excellent uniformity over a practical X-ray imaging
device area; (Aim2) developing a material design and process to integrate the X-ray detection perovskite films
into readout electronics with a robust mechanical connection and uniform electronic connection using several
soft materials based bonding techniques, The proposed technology has the potential to offer: (1) a factor of 10-
100 X patient imaging dose reduction; (2) increased imaging resolution; and (3) a flexibility and light weight
detector. The project leverages a recently discovered application of lead halide perovskites for ionization
radiation detection with demonstrated significantly higher sensitivity compared to the current mammography
detectors; Reducing the imaging dose will decrease the risk of radiation-induced cancer for patients, making the

10816974,"ApoE4 is the major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. In the central nervous
system (CNS), ApoE is mainly produced by glia and astrocytes and transports cholesterol to neurons via ApoE
receptors, which are members of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene family. ApoE isoform-
specific interactions with Aβ, namely ApoE/Aβ complex, modulates Aβ levels and is implicated in Aβ
clearance. C/EBPβ is an inflammatory cytokines-regulated transcription factor that can be activated by Aβ as
well. Interestingly, we have recently reported that C/EBPβ acts as an age-dependent transcription factor for
delta-secretase (AEP, also called legumain). This crucial protease cleaves both APP and Tau in human AD
brains and AD mouse models, promoting amyloidogenic pathway and neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) formation.
Inactivation of delta-secretase substantially decreases Aβ deposits and NFT aggregation and abolishes AD
pathologies in various AD mouse models. In our preliminary studies, we found that C/EBPβ binds ApoE
promoter and dictates ApoE mRNA transcription during aging. Knockout of C/EBPβ in 3xTg greatly reduces
ApoE levels and senile plaques. On the other hand, ApoE4 but not E3 strongly activates C/EBPβ in primary
neurons. Blockage of ApoE4 interaction with its receptor diminishes this effect. Moreover, 27-
hydroxycholesterol displays much stronger effect in stimulating C/EBPβ than cholesterol in the presence of
ApoE4. Hence, we hypothesize that ApoE4 and 27-oxycholesterol trigger C/EBPβ activation, which feeds
back and upregulates ApoE transcription in AD pathogenesis. Consequently, this vicious loop may
facilitate AD pathologies via escalating delta-secretase levels. To define the molecular mechanisms between
ApoE4/C/EBPβ crosstalk will provide an innovative insight into the pathological roles of ApoE4 in AD onset
and progression."
10817313,"Group B streptococcus (GBS) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are the primary causes of neonatal and
infant deaths with HIV-exposed uninfected infants bearing the highest brunt of disease. Although there are no
licensed vaccines against GBS and RSV, maternal vaccines are currently being developed and some
promising candidates are completing phase III clinical trials. Maternal vaccines are considered the optimal
strategy to prevent disease in both pregnant women and their respective infants. However, due to the low
incident rate per study setting for GBS, determining vaccine efficacy via phase III clinical trials could be
logistically infeasible. Therefore, to expedite vaccine licensure and implementation, an alternative pathway
would be to conduct immuno-bridging studies to establish antibody concentrations correlated with disease
protection as targets to measure vaccine immunogenicity in these vulnerable populations.
HIV infection impairs B cell immunity leading to the generation of defective antibodies. This could therefore
ultimately impact the efficacy of maternal vaccines against GBS and/or RSV in conferring protection to infants
including those that are HIV-exposed but uninfected. Since 95-99% of infant mortality cases related to GBS
and RSV occur in low-middle income countries (LMIC) where HIV infection is prevalent, it is crucially important
to consider how this would impact antibody thresholds and functional longevity required to confer protection to
the young. Moreover, clinical epidemiological studies report higher incidence of mortality cases amongst HIV-
exposed uninfected infants (iHEU) attributable to GBS and RSV diseases compared to HIV-unexposed
uninfected infants (iHUU). iHEU account for 20-30% of newborns in LMIC with ~1 million iHEU born each year.
To ensure that this vulnerable infant population is protected by the maternal vaccines being developed,
immunological parameters that could influence passive immunity in mother-infant pairs need to be established
for consideration when evaluating GBS and RSV immunogenicity in clinical trials. Although there is consensus
evidence that trans-placental antibody transfer is poor in iHEU compared to iHUU, there are a limited studies
reporting the kinetic profile and functionality of these transferred antibodies, and with even fewer studies
describing how HIV infection impacts breast milk antibodies against GBS and RSV. Using an existing
longitudinal INFANT cohort consisting of plasma and breastmilk samples, we propose to quantify mother-infant
antibody concentrations and functional kinetics to determine whether they are compromised by HIV-infection
(mother) or HIV-exposure (infant); information that is currently missing in existing literature. Our study therefore
proposes to use multiplex immunoassays to measure and compare antibody concentrations, avidity, and
function against GBS and RSV between iHEU and iHUU to establish parameters to be achieved for an
effective maternal vaccine in high HIV endemic regions."

Congenital valve defects (CVDs) constitute some of the most common human congenital heart defects (CHDs).
CVDs that lead to valve disease later in life, which can result in heart failure, stroke, blood clots, and even sudden
cardiac arrest. The most common therapy for valve diseases is invasive valve replacement surgery, which is one
of the most common procedures in the cardiac surgery market at nearly 182,000 per year in the USA, making
up nearly a quarter of the total procedural volume. Therefore, elucidating the early developmental and patterning
mechanisms driving normal cardiac valve development will give us novel insight into the etiology of CVDs.
Retinoic acid (RA) is the most active metabolic product of Vitamin A (retinol) within vertebrate embryos and is
reiteratively required for normal vertebrate heart development. Perturbations of RA signaling have been
associated with multiple types of CHDs, including CVDs, as well as valve diseases at later stages of
development. However, embryos devoid of early RA exhibit enlarged hearts due to the increased specification
and differentiation of cardiomyocytes. Despite the known requirements in heart development and previous
studies implying RA signaling is required for cardiac valve formation and maintenance, we still do not have clear
understanding of the requirements of early RA signaling in vertebrate valve development. Our preliminary work
using zebrafish shows that early inhibition of RA signaling results in an enlarged atrioventricular canal (AVC),
characterized by an expansion of myocardial AVC markers, which is consistent with the enlarged hearts in RA
deficient embryos. Surprisingly, despite the enlargement of the myocardial AVC region in RA deficient embryos
and expectation that this would result in typically larger valves, we find that the overlying atrioventricular valves
(AVVs) do not form, suggesting that a factor signaling from the myocardium to the overlying endocardium
necessary to promote AVV induction is lost. Our preliminary data show that canonical Wnt signaling is lost within
AVC cardiomyocytes following early inhibition of RA, suggesting that we have identified a new signaling node
necessary to promote normal AVV development. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that early RA signaling
directly establishes cardiac progenitors sufficient to turn on Wnt signaling later in the AVC myocardium required
for AVV development. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that Wnt signaling functions downstream of early RA
signaling in the induction of AVVs. Ultimately, the proposed studies could be used to identify and develop new
therapeutic approaches for treatment to prevent or ameliorate CVDs and their resulting valve diseases."
10817333,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Transcription factors and cellular signaling mechanisms establish and maintain regulatory networks that allow
the hematopoietic system to respond to infection, inflammation and other stresses. These networks mediate the
expansion, mobilization, and differentiation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). As exemplified
by human germline variation in genes encoding HSPC-regulatory factors, such as GATA2 and RUNX1, genetic
variation can disrupt HSPC activities, leading to recurring infection, cytopenia, and/or bone marrow failure.
However, the mechanisms underlying these defective responses are incompletely understood. We have
modeled human pathogenic variants causing GATA2 deficiency syndrome, where patients present with recurring
infections and cytopenias with progression to MDS and AML. This model utilizes mice with a single-nucleotide
variant from GATA2 deficiency patients, in conjunction with a severely impaired Gata2 +9.5 enhancer in the
second allele (compound heterozygous; CH), mimicking epigenetic silencing and allele-specific expression
correlating with disease presentation. We demonstrated that Gata2 variation alters steady-state HSPC levels,
blocks HSPC expansion and differentiation in response to chemotherapy, attenuates long-term repopulating
activity following bone marrow transplantation, leads to bone marrow failure following chronic inflammation by
the viral mimetic polyI:C, alters HSPC response to the bacterial cell wall component LPS, and attenuates HSPC
mobilization in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines, including G-CSF. We hypothesize that pathogenic
clinical variants disrupt GATA2- and infection/inflammatory-instigated networks essential for HSPC expansion
and differentiation, and we shall utilize global approaches to generate a rigorous foundation for elucidating how
variants impact networks in the context of sterile- and infection-induced inflammation. Aim 1 will develop global
insights into GATA2-dependent mechanisms that regulate HSPCs in response to bacterial infection and sterile
inflammation. Barcoding cell surface markers coupled with single cell RNA-sequencing (CITE-seq), will be
performed on HSPCs to determine pathways altered by the pathogen response, immunophenotypic populations
affected, and how clinical variants disrupt the networks. The contribution of the niche to HSPC function will also
be analyzed. Aim 2 will determine how fungal infection alters networks governing HSPC expansion, mobilization,
and inflammation, and the requirement of GATA2 in these processes. We will generate libraries of differentially
expressed transcripts in HSPC populations following infection with the pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus.
Inflammatory cytokines will be quantified via multiplex cytokine analysis. We will test if networks responsible for
HSPC response to fungal infection remain intact in GATA2 deficiency genetic models. These pilot studies will
leverage existing models to generate systems and omic datasets to elucidate how germline genetic variation
creates a predisposition to bone marrow failure."

Our twelve years of research has led to the discovery of triptonide (TN) as a promising non-
hormonal male contraceptive agent (Nature Communications, 2021, 12:1253). In addition to its
excellent potency and proven oral bioavailability, TN does not cause discernable toxic effects in
either mice or monkeys at its minimum effective dose. All available data strongly suggest that
TN is worth further investment to develop it as a viable non-hormonal male contraceptive drug
candidate. Taking advantage of the R61/R33 funding mechanism, we propose to conduct
several Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling studies to collect data required by the FDA for
official IND application. Specifically, we will conduct non-GLP toxicity and safety pharmacology
studies to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) followed by a six-month repeat dose
toxicity study using MTD and minimum effective doses (MED) in male Sprague-Dawley rats in
the R61 phase. In addition, deep learning-based pathological and RNA-seq-based
transcriptomic analyses will also be performed. The data will not only guide and corroborate the
GLP-compliant toxicity and safety pharmacology studies proposed in the R33 phase, but also
provide molecular insights for any potential phenotypes observed. In the R33 phase, we will
work with Pharmaron Inc. to perform non-GLP toxicity studies in dogs, in vitro secondary
pharmacology, and GLP-compliant repeat-dose toxicity and safety pharmacology studies all as
part of a package of studies intended to move triptonide into a Phase I clinical trial."
10808048,"ABSTRACT
Around the world, 93% of children under age 15 breathe toxic air every day that puts their health and
development at risk. Of 7 million deaths per year attributable to air pollution, over 60% are due to exposure to
household air pollution (HAP) from burning biomass fuels or kerosene for household energy needs. Such fuels
burn inefficiently, producing toxic pollutants like fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and black carbon (BC). Mothers
and children suffer the highest exposures, resulting in respiratory, cardiovascular, and neurologic injury. Risks
to children begin in-utero. Pregnant women inhale polluted air, with ill effects on their developing fetuses and
newborns, including growth restriction, preterm birth, and low birth weight. Mounting evidence suggests that
HAP can impair infant and child neurocognitive development. Particulate matter deposits in brain tissue
have been demonstrated; also, HAP is a medium of exposure to heavy metals. High exposures likely induce
oxidative stress and systemic inflammation. There is evidence of mediating factors: maternal stress level,
mother/child nutritional status, and home environment. We will explore the impact of HAP exposures on child
neurocognitive development, assessing the influence of known mediating factors. Our research capitalizes on
a unique opportunity flowing from a recent randomized controlled trial (RCT) in Nigeria. We randomized 324
pregnant women into groups based on fuel use: clean versus polluting. Polluting-fuel users showed: 1)
increased preterm delivery, miscarriage, and reduced gestational age at delivery, 2) biomarkers of placental
oxygen deprivation, 3) excessive placental vascularization, and 4) increased systemic inflammation. We further
found that polluting-fuel users reported more psychosocial stress and less energy during pregnancy. We have
continued to follow the RCT children (DISCOVERY COHORT), monitoring their HAP exposures. We propose now
to test the hypothesis that high pre- and postnatal HAP exposure negatively impacts neurocognitive
development. We will assess development in our DISCOVERY COHORT and an added VALIDATION COHORT of
newborns from a new group of pregnant (3rd trimester) women. We will monitor personal HAP exposures of
mothers and children, assessing biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress and blood levels of
micronutrients and heavy metals. We aim to assess neurocognitive development from infancy to age 8 years
as associated with: (1) prenatal and early childhood HAP exposures; (2) maternal psychosocial stress level,
maternal and child nutritional status, and child's home environment. Impact: Results will illuminate how HAP
exposures and maternal stress affect child neurocognitive development, informing policies to reduce HAP
through programs that promote use of clean-fuel cookstoves. We will develop language/culturally-adapted
assessments of child neurocognition—much needed in sub-Saharan Africa—and establish pilot performance
norms. This will build capacity for more research of this kind in Nigeria in the future."
10808049,"Project Summary/Abstract
In-home monitoring technologies have the potential to transform the healthcare system by enabling the
transition from reactive care to proactive and preventive care. This is especially important for cardiovascular
disease (CVD); the leading cause of death worldwide. Heart failure (HF), a type of CVD characterized by a
weakened heart muscle, impacts approximately 6.5 million Americans with over 960,000 new cases each year.
HF costs the US an estimated $30.7 billion annually and is expected to increase 127% to $69.7 billion by 2030.
With approximately 80% of the total cost associated with HF due to hospitalization, there is an opportunity to
reduce the cost of HF by lowering hospitalization rates through remote patient monitoring. Since patient
awareness of symptomology often lags deterioration, successfully tracking physiologic changes in the home is
a critical component of an early intervention strategy. Classical approaches to in-home monitoring, such as
blood pressure and weight monitoring have had limited success, with patient adherence cited as major barrier
to reducing hospitalizations.
The central hypothesis of this research is that hospitalization rates and duration of stay for heart failure patients
can be significantly reduced through inconspicuous in-home monitoring and early intervention. This research
will leverage a highly innovative technology for cardiovascular in-home daily monitoring; the fully integrated
toilet seat (FIT). The FIT seat automatically captures a comprehensive cardiovascular assessment in the
home, while ensuring long-term patient adherence. A multidisciplinary research team, comprised of engineers,
physicians, advanced practice providers (APP), data scientists, biostatisticians, designers, and software
developers, will advance an automated system that provides health care providers with early warning of patient
deterioration using the FIT system measurements captured in the home. The success of this system will be
evaluated through an in-home clinical trial of heart failure patients.
Specific Aim 1 seeks to create a learning dataset and data visualization architecture from HF patient in-home
physiologic data, perceived wellness, and adverse events. The FIT seat will be deployed for a 90-day in-home
study of 200 HF patients, with patient perceived wellness and activity captured through a custom application.
This physiologic, wellness, and activity data will be combined with adverse events from the electronic medical
record to create an integrated dataset for retrospective analysis and alert model development. In Aim 2, an
automated prediction model for early alert of all-cause hospitalizations will be created using novel machine
learning techniques. The objective of Aim 3 is to demonstrate that inconspicuous in-home monitoring and
early intervention can reduce hospitalizations in a second cohort of 200 HF patients. We hypothesize that the
integrated FIT-based alert system will reduce the burden of all-cause hospitalization and will improve the
quality of life for patients."
10808052,"The challenge of drug-resistant microbes requires that a new generation of basic scientists be broadly trained
and educated in a triad of equally important sub-disciplines of anti-infective research: i.) mechanisms of
antimicrobial resistance (AMR); ii.) antimicrobial discovery and development; and iii.) vaccinology to prevent or
treat infections for which antimicrobial therapies are absent or becoming ineffectual due to AMR. The continued
success of the Antimicrobial Resistance and Therapeutic Discovery Training Program (ARTDTP) of Emory
University will help to ensure that a cadre of investigators will be available in the future to combat the global
health problem of AMR. This need for future scientists in anti-infective research is an international priority given
the reduced number of new, effective antimicrobials (antibiotics and antivirals) that have entered clinical practice
in the past two decades and the difficulty often faced by physicians in treating certain infections because of AMR
or the lack of effective therapeutics. Thus, the objective of the competitive renewal of ARTDTP is to provide high
quality training to a select group of highly motivated graduate students for careers as independent investigators.
Towards that end, ARTDTP will select five Ph.D. candidates yearly from four graduate programs within the
Graduate Division of Biological and Biomedical Sciences and the Department of Chemistry for a two-year period
of training in the areas of AMR and therapeutic discovery through chemical or immunologic-based
strategies. ARTDTP faculty members who will serve as the pool of preceptors for trainees are highly
collaborative and span the university with academic appointments in basic science and clinical departments of
the School of Medicine and Emory College of Arts and Sciences. Educational training will consist of a
course of study and programmatic events in sub-disciplines that emphasize research and education in AMR
and drug discovery or vaccine development. ARTDTP will be governed by an Executive Committee and
evaluated bi-yearly by an external Advisory Committee and by trainees after completion of their two-year
program of training. Recruitment of under-represented minority students (URMS) from local and national
colleges and universities will be a priority for ARTDTP and specific initiatives coupled with university-based
programs will be employed to maximally train URMS. In addition to training in the sub-disciplines of anti-
infective research ARTDTP trainees will receive education in the essential concepts of rigor, reproducibility
and ethics that are needed for careers in the biological and biomedical fields. Upon completion of training
and receipt of the Ph.D. degree, ARTDTP trainees will be ready to assume post-doctoral positions in
academia, government or industry that continue their interests developed through the training experience
provided by our T32 pre-doctoral program."
10808053,"The human proteasome plays an essential role in both protein homeostasis and in
the regulation of multiple cellular processes from signal transduction to
transcription. It has also become a proven target for developing drugs for treating
multiple diseases including multiple myeloma and lymphoma. Several inhibitors of
the proteasome, including bortezomib, carfilzomib and ixazomib, have been used
in the clinic, responsible for prolonging lives of multiple myeloma patients.
However, the existing proteasome-targeted drugs suffer from severe toxicity and
rapid emergence of drug resistance, which also limits their potential in treating
other types of diseases. We have developed a rapamycin-inspired macrocycle
library known as rapafucins by fusing the FKBP-binding domain (FKBD) of
rapamycin with a combinatorial peptide library. A screen of the rapafucin library in
multiple myeloma cell line NCI-H929 led to the identification of a potent inhibitor,
Rapaprotin that induces apoptosis in NCI-H929 cells. Rapaprotin exhibited
selective toxicity to cancer cells over normal cells. It also has a unique mechanism
of action, requiring activation by an intracellular protease through cleavage of the
macrocycle into a linear form, Rapaprotin-L, which inhibits all three types of
protease activities of the proteasome. Moreover, Rapaprotin is synergistic with
bortezomib and is capable of resensitizing bortezomib-resistant cancer cells to the
drug. In this application, we will investigate the mechanism of activation of
Rapaprotin by the cellular protease, validating Rapaprotin-L as the active species
for its cellular activity. We will obtain a high-resolution cryo-EM structure of the
complex between proteasome and Rapaprotin-L. We will optimize the potency and
pharmacokinetic property of Rapaprotin through design and synthesis of new
analogs. The optimized analogs of Rapaprotin will be assessed for their efficacy in
animal models of multiple myeloma and other diseases. The newly developed
Rapaprotin analogs will serve as useful chemical probes to facilitate the study of
the function and pharmacology of the proteasome and promising leads for
developing a new class of anticancer and immunosuppressive drugs with lower
adverse effects."

The MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) T32 Research Training in Academic Medical Oncology Program
capitalizes on the availability of highly qualified fellows from within the MDACC Hematology/Medical Oncology
fellowship program to provide two years of academic research training to selected first-year fellows who have
demonstrated strong commitment to a career as a physician scientist or translational clinical investigator in
Medical Oncology. The T32 training program is thus a “program within a program,” but has a separate and
distinct organizational and administrative structure with the following specific objectives: 1) To provide and
integrate robust didactic, clinical, and lab-based research components within a structured training program
focused on the conduct of innovative medical oncology-based research; 2) To prepare trainees for successful
careers in academic medicine as physician scientists and clinician investigators focused on novel discoveries
and their clinical translation to improve the outcomes of patients with cancer; and 3) To provide a broad range
of structured career development opportunities, including the development of skills necessary to obtain peer-
reviewed funding to support each trainees’ transition to a faculty position in academic medical oncology. Our
T32 program involves new leadership with Dr. Michael Davies and Dr. Katy Rezvani as Co-PIs, both
accomplished investigators with long-term commitments to education and established track records in
successfully mentoring trainees. The program involves an expanded panel of highly accomplished and
nationally/internationally recognized program faculty (including Drs. James Allison, Ron DePinho, Helen
Piwnica-Worms, Patrick Hwu, John Heymach and others), and provides a broad range of training opportunities
that fully exploits the unique research environment at MDACC. These opportunities include participation in new
and rapidly developing multidisciplinary research programs in genomic medicine, systems biology, targeted drug
development for personalized cancer therapy, and cancer immunotherapy, including cellular immune therapies
and hematopoietic transplantation. The program is also enhanced by the extensive programmatic and shared
resources of MD Anderson as an NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center. The T32 program has been
highly successful in producing academic medical oncologists who have made a major impact on the field, with
88% of the T32 graduates in the past ten years successfully obtaining academic faculty appointments. This
renewal application includes additional plans for career development and mentorship to meet the challenges of
an increasingly competitive landscape for young investigators. Finally, our application includes an invigorated
program governance structure to further our development of the next generation of leaders in clinical,
translational, and laboratory-based oncology research."
10808074,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Heritable retinal disorders, for which effective treatments are generally unavailable, contributes to the 1.02
million adults who are blind in the US. Among children, the heritable disease - Leber Congenital Amaurosis,
accounts for 20% of blindness, and 10-15%of those are caused by mutations in the CRB1 gene. In addition to
LCA, CRB1 mutations can also cause congenital or early-onset retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a more slowly
progressive disease. CRB1 RP variants are sometimes associated with unique disease features, such as
retinal telangiectasia with or without exudative retinal detachment (Coat's disease), a loss of RPE pigmentation
except near arterioles (preservation of para-arteriolar RPE or PPRPE), pigment paravenous chorioretinal
atrophy, cone-rod dystrophy, nanophthalmos with optic disc drusen, retinoschisis, cystoid macular edema, and
macular dystrophic disease. The cause of the wide range of disease phenotypes associated
with CRB1 mutations is not fully understood. Genotype-phenotype correlations that could explain the disease
spectrum have not been detected among patients bearing CRB1 mutations, suggesting that environmental
factors or genetic background modifiers contribute to the variability in the disease phenotypes observed.
Another potential contributor to the phenotypic variability in disease presentation are Crb1 isoforms which have
recently been shown to have spatially and temporally distinct expression patterns. Clearly, understanding the
reasons for the variability and the mechanisms underlying the observed pathologies is extremely important for
developing effective therapies.
In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that pathological changes due to Crb1 mutations depend upon the
isoform affected and the genetic background on which it occurs, and their potential interactions. We will identify
the molecular basis of genetic modifiers that enhance or suppress Crb1rd8 associated disease phenotypes or
are epistatic upon Crb1rd8. Through the use of mouse models with isoform specific knockout alleles and
controlled genetic backgrounds, we will determine their contribution to disease variability and the mechanisms
through which they function.
These studies address a critical unmet need for acquiring the basic biological knowledge necessary to develop
effective therapies that can target the pre-symptomatic stage to prevent, delay onset or decrease severity of
the disease. Animal models serve an important and unique role to further our understanding of the genetic
underpinnings of disease and as a resource to examine tissue pathology, and to perform pre-clinical
therapeutic tests that cannot be readily conducted in humans."

The role of environmental chemicals known as obesogens in the etiology of human adiposity has been
increasingly appreciated. In this proposal, we aim to evaluate polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and
heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs) in relation to weight change in human subjects. The carcinogenic effects
of these ubiquitous pollutants are well-documented, and emerging evidence suggests that these chemicals
may also disrupt endocrine functions through exerting estrogenic effects and other pathways. Limited human
evidence, often from cross-sectional studies, also supports the hypothesis that these chemicals are potential
obesogens, although prospective data are needed to substantiate the associations between these chemicals
and excess weight gain in humans. We propose to 1) examine excretion of PAHs and HAAs in 24-hour urine
samples in relation to short-term weight loss induced by energy restriction in the POUNDS Lost trial; 2)
evaluate whether changes in urinary excretion of these chemicals during weight loss period predict weight
regain in the POUNDS Lost trial; and 3) investigate associations between levels of these chemicals in 24-hour
urine samples and long-term weight change in women and men participating in the Nurses' Health Study II
(NHSII) and Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA). In addition, in light of the pathways
through which these two groups of chemicals may synergistically amplify each other's detrimental effects, we
will also examine potential interactions between PAHs and HAAs on weight loss, weight regain, and long-term
weight change in the studies. To ensure high quality scientific data, we have carefully designed our proposed
studies. In the POUNDS Lost, NHSII, and CARDIA studies, we will quantify PAHs and HAAs in 24-hour urine
samples to substantially improve the reproducibility of urinary measurements over time. In all three studies,
body weight and a multitude of other variables that are related with body weight change have been collected
repeatedly during follow-up, allowing for comprehensive, longitudinal data analyses. We will restrict the
research to largely healthy, non-smoking individuals to minimize the impact of chronic diseases and smoking
on the associations of interest. To accomplish the aims, we have assembled an experienced research team
with interdisciplinary expertise in the fields of environmental health, obesity epidemiology, biomarker research,
biostatistics and bioinformatics, and toxicology. We will collaborate with highly reputable labs at the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention to measure PAH and HAA levels in 24-hour urine samples. Data to be
generated from this project will substantially deepen our understanding of the potential, obesogenic effects of
PAHs and HAAs in human populations. Moreover, evidence from this proposed research will also aid in the
development of policies or recommendations toward reducing exposures to these chemicals and improving
human health."
10808079,"Summary
Alternative splicing is nearly universal in human genes, producing multiple distinct mRNAs and proteins from
each individual gene locus. This process is regulated by over one hundred splicing factors that bind to specific
RNA motifs in the primary transcript and modulate splicing by interaction with core splicing machinery or with
other splicing factors. This proposal seeks to understand the rules that govern the activities of splicing factors.
Each splicing factor's activity can be summarized by an RNA map that describes how its activity depends on
location of binding relative to the regulated exon or splice sites. It is organized around the following aims.
SA1. To develop and test second-generation (2G) “RNA Maps” describing splicing factor activity
SA2. To understand the protein sequence determinants of splicing regulatory activity and improve RNA
 maps using engineered splicing factors
SA3. To improve RNA maps by incorporating indirect and interaction effects
In Aim 1, we will develop models that distinguish notions of “affinity”, “binding”, “location”, and “regulatory
activity”, and will develop software to generate 2G RNA maps from different combinations of data types,
including in vitro and/or in vivo binding data and RNA sequencing data, and will extend these maps to several
types of RNA processing events. In Aim 2 we will identify protein sequence features that confer different types
of splicing regulation, and will engineer “hyperactive” splicing factors to produce larger splicing changes and
improve functional inference. Finally, we will dissect direct regulation by a factor from indirect regulation
– where one splicing factor regulates another that directly regulates the splicing of other genes – and will also
consider how splicing factors may cooperate or antagonize one another's regulatory activity. Together, these
studies will improve our understanding of how RNA splicing factors work, enabling improved understanding of
disease states where splicing factors are mutated (including many blood cancers), and improved prediction of
the effects of sequence variants in the human genome that cause disease by altering splicing factor binding
sites in exons and introns."
10808187,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Though diabetes prevalence has increased nationally, geographic disparities have widened with higher
diabetes-related mortality in rural regions than in urban areas. Evidence suggests that an unhealthy food
environment increases diabetes risk in urban areas, but crude measures of the food environment may not
capture the risk of rural diabetes. Therefore, robust analyses of the food environment and rural diabetes must
measure exposures at the correct geographic scale and quantify how certain food purchases can increase
diabetes risk. The hazards of the food environment not only include an unhealthy imbalance of macronutrients,
but also dietary chemical exposures such as bisphenols and phthalates. These chemicals are now recognized
as endocrine disruptors that may promote insulin resistance and diabetes. Though previous studies of diabetes
risk have explored poor diet quality and dietary contaminants in isolation of each other, this study seeks to
compare the combined impact of both hazards on diabetes risk among rural residents. To accomplish this goal,
the study will obtain detailed dietary data through food frequency questionnaires and receipts of food
purchases, measure estimated daily intake and urinary levels of bisphenols and phthalates, and use point-of-
care HbA1c testing to identify key risk factors associated with rural diabetes. The study setting will be Sullivan
County, New York, a rural county with the second-to-worst health ranking and rate of premature death in New
York State, and also a high burden of diabetes. Though not representative of all rural regions, the
impoverished, predominately White rural population of Sullivan County is an understudied group at high risk for
poor diabetic outcomes. Therefore, the specific aims of this study will be to: 1) determine whether the diet
quality of rural residents is influenced by their geographic locations and characteristics of their local food
environment, 2) calculate estimated daily intake of bisphenols and phthalates based on the food consumption
patterns of rural residents and compare results to urinary levels of these chemicals, and 3) use point-of-care
HbA1c tests to identify how poor diet quality and dietary contaminants affect glycemic control among rural
residents without a prior diagnosis of diabetes."
10814857,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Nearly 1 in 3 children and adolescents – 23 million youth – in the United States are affected by overweight or
obesity, and low-income, racial/ethnic minority and rural children are disproportionately impacted. Beyond the
adverse impact of obesity on physical, social, and emotional wellbeing in childhood, children with obesity are at
greater risk of obesity in adulthood, placing them at higher risk of obesity-related cancers, cardiometabolic
disease, and early mortality. Despite guidance from the US Preventive Services Task Force and expert
committees, pediatric primary care clinicians often do not follow available guidance for managing children with
obesity. Electronic health records (EHRs) have the potential to improve clinicians' diagnosis and management
of obesity by providing tools such as reminders and clinical decision support. We have demonstrated that an
intervention package, consisting of EHR-based decision support for pediatricians and educational materials for
parents, improved BMI among children in two clinical trials at a multisite group practice in Massachusetts. We
have previously estimated, using a simulation model of the U.S. population, that high-fidelity dissemination and
implementation of this intervention package among pediatric primary care practices with fully functional EHRs
over 10 years has the potential to reach 2 million children with obesity and avert 43,000 cases of obesity at 10
years. However, little is known regarding the effectiveness of the intervention in various pediatric primary care
settings, particularly those serving children from populations disproportionately impacted by obesity, or regarding
the specific factors that influence the successful adoption and implementation of these tools. In partnership with
a national practice-based research network, we aim to capitalize on advances in the field of Implementation
Science to apply and evaluate this intervention for childhood obesity among a sample of 84 primary care
practices affiliated with three health systems serving children with racial/ethnic, socio-economic, rural-urban, and
geographic diversity. The scientific objectives of the proposed award are (1) to optimize a stakeholder-informed
intervention and implementation package tailored to site-specific context among a national sample of
participating practices, (2) to evaluate the impact of the intervention and implementation facilitation package in
improving obesity-related care delivery and children’s BMI, and (3) to rigorously examine what works where and
why among participating practice sites. To achieve these aims, we have assembled a transdisciplinary team with
expertise is obesity, implementation science, clinical informatics, mixed methods, multi-site interventions, and
user-centered design. We will apply a Hybrid Type 2 effectiveness-implementation study design wherein we will
employ mixed methods in our formative and summative evaluation plan. To facilitate broad-scale dissemination
in future implementation efforts, the results from this proposed study will provide invaluable evidence on the
effectiveness of the intervention package and implementation facilitation strategy in settings serving populations
most heavily burdened by obesity."

Due to expanded clinical implementation of genetic testing and technologies across healthcare specialties,
there is a huge demand for genetic counseling services in clinical, industry, public health, and academia. The
roles of genetic counselors have changed and grown drastically over the 40 years since the field's inception.
As the field has expanded to over 4,000, there is greater need for genetic counselors to be able to research the
practice in an evidence-based fashion. At present, a two-year Master’s Degree in Genetic Counseling
constitutes the terminal degree for genetic counselors, the majority who practice in clinic settings. While
genetic counselors are primed to study the profession in their current roles, additional research training is
needed to foster the necessary skills and methodology expertise to lead independent research programs. In
recognition that the field of genetic counseling would benefit from additional research funding and that our
research team is well poised to meet this need, we have created the first ever research fellowship for genetic
counselors called the Genetic Counseling Fellowship in Research Training (GC-FIRST) at the University of
Minnesota. Upon completion of this comprehensive 2-year, part-time research education experience, four
genetic counselors will be exceptionally well positioned to contribute to the growing need for genetic
counseling researchers. The overarching objective of GC-FIRST is to train genetic counselors in a range of
research methodologies to promote research implementation by genetic counselors working in clinical,
industry, public and population health settings. Our central goal is to educate genetic counseling researchers to
be independent leaders who mentor future genetic counseling researchers. To reach this goal and attain the
overall objective, we will: 1) Develop a rigorous qualitative and quantitative training in the fundamentals and
advances in genetic counseling research through a series of formal coursework and training modules; 2)
Provide interdisciplinary research training using a practical, application based, and collaborative approach to
produce two manuscripts and a grant application; 3) Generate a diverse cohort of well-trained research
clinicians that will have enthusiasm for lifelong learning to bolster the genetic counseling research workforce; 4)
Evaluate the short term and long term summative and formative outcomes of the two-year fellowship. If
successful, this application would create the first research training fellowship program for genetic counselors
and contribute to the workforce in academic, clinical, industry, public and population health settings. An added
end-product of the fellowship will be the creating and distribution of a set of online modules that will be
packaged to educate an even greater number of genetic counselors with advanced research training."

The explosion of new knowledge in genomics, cell biology and biomedical engineering technology is ripe for
translation into new orthopaedic applications for improving the diagnosis and management of patients with
musculoskeletal disorders. Orthopaedic research programs have been slow to capitalize on this opportunity
because of inherent structural impediments in this discipline, which have increasingly distanced orthopaedic
surgeons and basic scientists in the pursuit of translational research projects. This renewal application
proposes the continuation of the Training in Orthopaedic Team Science (TOTS) program, which is modeled
after the proven team science approach used by pharmaceutical companies. This program sponsors the
pursuit of well circumscribed, translational research projects by discovery teams composed of orthopaedic
residents, post-doctoral Ph.D. fellows, medical students and faculty preceptors. Trainees complete a
personalized curriculum based on their background and the project topic designed to provide a solid foundation
of understanding of the scientific principles of the project. Both research and didactic phases of the learning
experience occur concurrently by the trainees to ensure constant interaction between basic and clinical team
members. An Enrichment Program catalyze interactions between trainees and faculty and provide valuable
career development training. The TOTS Steering Committee oversees the project and team selection process,
and evaluate the program's performance using tools for assessing short and long-term measures. An Internal
Advisory Committee provides independent, ongoing evaluation of the program and coordinates feedback from
trainees, training program faculty, and an External Advisory Committee. Our successful implementation of the
TOTS program has demonstrated that the trainees have benefited by this training regarding their research
quality, publication and presentation productivity, and leadership skills. Continuation of the TOTS program will
result in musculoskeletal scientists who will enter the workforce with the requisite experience in translational
research and leadership training to move discoveries effectively between the bench and bedside."
10814891,"PROJECT SUMMARY
An effective vaccine is likely required to reduce the global burden of tuberculosis (TB). Development of one
has been difficult, in part due to the ability for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) to reside for long periods
within host antigen (Ag) presenting cells (APCs), where it expresses a multitude of Ags, many of which have
been targeted for vaccine development. Recombinant Ags have been the focus of numerous vaccines,
however outcomes to clinical testing have been less than ideal. This R61/R33 proposal in response to program
announcement RFA-AI-21-007: “Innovation for Tuberculosis Vaccine Discovery” will leverage a next-
generation, vaccine adjuvant system that induces seamless particle-formation of recombinant Ags to assess a
multivalent Mtb vaccine. A new immunization paradigm will be advanced, based on combining (via simple
mixing) well-characterized soluble protein Mtb Ags with a vaccine adjuvant that induces spontaneous
nanoliposome-Ag particleization. Liposomes that contain small amounts of cobalt porphyrin-phospholipid
(CoPoP) bind to his-tagged Ags via spontaneous insertion of the his-tag into the bilayer. This approach gives
rise to rapid particleization that is stable in biological media. Recombinant Ags are simply admixed with CoPoP
liposomes at the time of vaccination (without further purification) to be fully converted for display on the surface
of ~100 nm particles. CoPoP recently completed phase I and entered phase II clinical testing as a key
component of a COVID-19 vaccine (NCT04783311). CoPoP also induces potent cellular responses using short
MHC-I restricted peptide immunogens at nanogram peptide dosing in mice; multiple orders of magnitude lower
dosing compared to Ag doses with conventional vaccine adjuvants. Preliminary data demonstrates that
multivalent particles decorated with the established Mtb Ags Ag85A, CFP10, ESAT-6, HSP-X, and Mpt64
induce protective cellular immune responses in mice. The underlying hypothesis is that multivalent, particle-
based Mtb Ags will induce a potently protective immune responses more effective than Bacillus Calmette–
Guérin (BCG) in multiple small animal models of TB infection. The R61 phase of the proposal will use mouse
models of TB infection to: (1) Develop well-characterized, multivalent Mtb Ag particles; (2) Assess how particle
parameters impact functional immunogenicity; and (3) Compare the efficacy of intranasal and intramuscular
particle administration. Ambitious and quantitative R61-R33 transitional milestones are proposed based on A)
generating well-characterized particles with storage stability with B) multivalent Ags providing superior
protection relative to the best single Ag particles with C) superiority to conventional BCG immunization in mice.
The R33 phase of the project will involve (4) assessing the vaccine in the guinea pig model, and (5) developing
and assessing the efficacy and toxicity of a lyophilized thermostable version of the vaccine."
10802123,"Although Veteran suicide prevention is the top VA clinical priority, a striking number of Veterans
attempt suicide: around 17 Veterans die by suicide each day. Decades of research have gone to
furthering VA’s understanding of suicide risk, yet some important risk factors remain understudied.
Reactive aggression, or aggressive behavior in response to provocation, represent a consistent, robust
risk factor for suicide behaviors among civilians, but is seldom studied as a suicide behavior risk factor
among Veterans. Further, the sparse existing research examining the association between aggression
and suicide in Veterans is limited by 1) conflation of reactive and proactive (unprovoked) aggression;
2) potentially misleading results due to inadequate power to predict low base-rate events, such as
suicide behavior; 3) an overreliance on self-report measures of aggression; and 4) a lack of attention
given to Veteran cultural factors relevant in understanding suicide risk.
 The objective of this Career Development Award-1 (CDA-1) is to explore the association between
reactive aggression and suicide behaviors among a sample of Veterans at high-risk for suicide. This
objective will be accomplished with the following specific aims: 1) prospectively analyze the association
between self-reported current reactive aggression and suicidal behavior while controlling for past suicidal
behavior; 2) assess the acceptability and utility of a multimethod assessment of aggression; and 3) test the
unique contributions of specific military experiences (e.g., years of service, combat experience, date
since separation) to reactive aggression and suicide behaviors. To accomplish these aims, Dr. Krauss
will leverage Dr. Marianne Goodman’s (primary mentor) CSR&D-funded clinical trial of Project Life
Force (PLF; CX001705), a suicide safety planning intervention. PLF was recently selected as one of
the five ORD-funded research projects nationally to be featured for VA research Week 2022. Veterans
(N ~ 200) will complete self-report measures of reactive aggression and suicide behaviors and a
clinician-administered interview of suicidal ideation and behavior. Dr. Krauss will also administer a
clinician-administered interview and laboratory based task of aggression to a subset of Veterans in this
parent study as part of a multimethod assessment of aggression designed for this proposal.
 This CDA-1 will provide support to advance Dr. Krauss’s goal of becoming an independent VA
research psychologist with expertise in suicide prevention among Veterans. To achieve this goal, Dr.
Krauss has crafted a rigorous yet attainable training plan with the following training goals: (1) gain new
knowledge and skills in suicide prevention research methodology; (2) learn how to administer and
interpret a multimethod assessment of aggression; (3) master advanced statistical techniques based
on counterfactual approaches to causal inference and modern missing data analyses; (4) identify
Veteran-specific experiences that contribute to suicide and aggression; and (5) improve competence
in VA grantsmanship and professional development. Given her research and clinical background in
aggression, this CDA-1 project is the natural extension of Dr. Krauss’s prior work. This CDA-1 training
plan includes mentorship from VA and academic experts in the field of suicide prevention (Drs.
Marianne Goodman [primary mentor], Joseph Geraci [mentor]), multimethod assessments of
aggression (Dr. Michael McCloskey [mentors]), advanced statistical techniques (Dr. Solomon Kurz
[mentor]), Veteran culture (Dr. Geraci), VA career development (Mark Ilgen [consultant]), and
Veteran aggression (Dr. Suzannah Creech [consultant]). Through the research and training aims of
this award, Dr. Krauss will be well positioned to develop a CDA-2 focused on developing a suicide
prevention program targeting aggression for Service Members/Veterans transitioning out of the military."
10800852,"ABSTRACT
In the United States, severe obesity (BMI ≥ 40.0 kg/m2) disproportionally affects non-Hispanic Black females of
reproductive age. Severe obesity is a significant predictor of adverse perinatal outcomes including gestational
diabetes mellitus (GDM), pre-eclampsia, premature birth, and at its most severe, fetal death, birth defects and a
three-fold greater risk of maternal mortality – outcomes that also disproportionately affect Black females.
Observational studies suggest weight maintenance and even modest body fat loss and altering the maternal
metabolic milieu (availability of glucose and lipids) in the gestational period may be important to reducing
perinatal health risks among pregnant females with severe obesity. Existing lifestyle interventions (calorie
control/dietary pattern changes/physical activity) have showed modest effects on attenuating excess gestational
weight gain and modest effects on perinatal health outcomes among pregnant females with obesity. Time-
restricted eating (TRE), where an individual simply watches the clock and consumes calories within a particular
eating window, is a simple and highly accessible eating pattern that has the potential to minimize gestational
weight gain, reduce excess glucose and lipids, and improve metabolic health among pregnant females with
severe obesity all of which could translate to improved perinatal health outcomes. Yet there are no clinical trials
of TRE in pregnancy. In response to PAS-20-160 - Small R01s for Clinical Trials Targeting Diseases within the
Mission of NIDDK, we aim to test the safety, feasibility, and acceptability of TRE among 60 pregnant Black
females with severe obesity. We will examine the preliminary efficacy of TRE (8-hr eating window in the 2nd
trimester & 10-hr eating window in the 3rd trimester) vs. Standard Care on safety, feasibility, and preliminary
efficacy on weight, cardiometabolic risk markers and perinatal health outcomes. The intervention will begin at
~16 weeks gestational age (GA) and continue through admission for labor and delivery. The study will involve
weekly meetings with a research team member, and research visits at baseline (~16 weeks GA), 25-27 weeks
GA and 35-37 weeks GA. Maternal and fetal health monitoring will occur weekly through a combination of
research specific assessments and clinical data collected during routine prenatal care and at labor and delivery
via patient electronic health records. The goal of our work is to reduce and prevent adverse perinatal outcomes
among pregnant Black females including those with severe obesity. In alignment with NIDDK’s mission, this
small-scale R01 study will provide the necessary data to accelerate the initiation of a full-scale efficacy trial of
TRE in pregnancy. Given the relative simplicity of TRE it can be easily disseminated in clinic demonstrating its
strong potential for wide-scale public health impact."
10839473,"Dual Sensory Loss (DSL) is the co-occurrence of vision and hearing loss. The prevalence of DSL rises
steeply with age and is expected to increase as the American population ages. People with DSL have increased
difficulties in daily functioning, because many real-life tasks require both vision and hearing. Despite extensive
attention to the rehabilitation for vision and hearing loss separately, very little attention has been paid to the
specific challenges faced by people with DSL. The candidate’s long term goal is to improve the quality of life and
independence of people with DSL by optimizing the utilization of their residual vision and hearing. The current
study focuses on their spatial localization. Spatial localization refers to determining the direction of sounds and
visual objects in the environment, and it is important for safe mobility and effective social interaction.
In the K99 phase, the candidate’s goal is to investigate the impacts of vision and hearing deficits, both
individually and in combination, on the spatial localization of people with DSL, and to establish a spatial
“perimetry” measure to characterize these effects. In a controlled laboratory context (Aim 1), the candidate plans
to measure the localization perimetry of subjects with DSL, in each of the visual, auditory, and audiovisual
conditions. The candidate will then measure subjects’ localization ability in two simulated real-life tasks (Aim 2):
understanding a speaker among a group of people, and localizing a car that is about to move in a parking lot.
The findings in Aim 1 will be verified in these ecologically relevant social and mobility contexts in Aim 2.
In the R00 phase, the candidate’s goal is to develop and evaluate training methods that can improve the
spatial localization ability of people with DSL. The candidate proposes that a training plan needs to be tailored
based on the evaluation of the individual’s spatial localization ability. Two training methods are developed with
the purposes of recalibrating the visual and auditory space perception, improving auditory and visual spatial
localization ability, and facilitating audiovisual combination to maximize the use of residual vision and hearing.
The K99 phase will take place in the University of Minnesota, where the candidate will be jointly mentored
by Dr. Gordon Legge who specializes in low-vision research, Dr. Peggy Nelson who specializes in hearing-loss
research, and Dr. Dan Kersten who specializes in computational vision science. The candidate will also receive
excellent advice in auditory perception from Dr. Andrew Oxenham, in ophthalmology from Dr. Erik van Kuijk and
in audiology from Dr. Evelyn Davies-Venn. The training plan is to extend the candidate’s knowledge in
translational vision and hearing science, the techniques of multisensory modelling, the pathology of vision and
hearing impairment, and the contemporary strategies of assessment and rehabilitation. With successful training,
the candidate will independently conduct the studies in the R00 phase. The candidate’s career goal is to lead a
research team to improve the life quality and independence of people with DSL."

The primary visual cortex (V1) can learn to encode spatiotemporal relationships based on visual
experience and uses the resulting functional memory to actively predict how the visual scene will unfold in
time. This demonstrates expression of a canonical cortical function localized in an experimentally
accessible region. We propose to leverage the tools of modern neuroscience to mechanistically dissect
this ability in the mouse, with the overall aim of developing a description of how the neocortex learns to
represent temporal information. The primary goals of this work are first to understand how similar forms of
visual stimulation drive different forms of short and long-term plasticity that can encode either spatial or
temporal information, and second to identify the distinct mechanisms involved. In addition to their direct
relevance to sensory neurobiology, various psychiatric and neurological disorders, and visual physiology
our experiments will address the wider question of how cortical circuits learn to use temporal relationships
to build predictive models of the world, the answer to which remains as murky as it is critical for our
understanding of the brain."

 Non-immune hydrops fetalis (NIHF) is diagnosed on prenatal ultrasound when abnormal fluid collections
are seen in the fetus. NIHF carries significant risks of stillbirth, preterm birth, and postnatal morbidity and
mortality, particularly when the etiology remains unknown and critical opportunities for focused care and
implementation of treatments are missed. In contrast, when an etiology is found, both pre- and postnatal
management are directly impacted: counseling is focused, risks to the fetus and neonate are accurately
anticipated, in utero surveillance and available treatments such as intrauterine transfusions are implemented,
and postnatal treatments are promptly initiated to optimize outcomes. Our overarching hypothesis is that
discovering the precise etiologies of NIHF will create critical opportunities to improve outcomes through earlier,
targeted pre- and postnatal care. In our preliminary study of 127 NIHF cases unexplained by standard
microarray or karyotype, we identified pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants implicating a genetic disease in
29% with exome sequencing (ES), as well as a variant of potential clinical significance in another 9%.
Importantly, the diseases we identified are also greatly variable in their ultimate severity as well as in their pre-
and postnatal clinical management. However, several important steps remain in order to uncover the genetic
etiologies for cases remaining unsolved and improve our care for these pregnancies.
 As such, we propose a multicenter collaboration to discover additional genetic diseases and novel
variants underlying NIHF in a prospectively enrolled, large and diverse cohort utilizing whole genome
sequencing (WGS) and RNA sequencing. We will further perform comprehensive phenotyping to: a) collect
detailed postnatal phenotypes and outcomes, b) re-analyze WGS data utilizing postnatal phenotype to identify
diagnoses missed when sequencing algorithms incorporated only in utero phenotype, and c) expand the in
utero phenotypes of all genetic diseases we identify to optimize prenatal diagnosis and yield of genomic testing
during pregnancy. Our multidisciplinary team is ideally positioned to excel, and includes experienced
individuals in Perinatology, Clinical and Molecular Genetics, Statistical Genetics, Genetic Epidemiology,
Bioinformatics, Computational Biology, and Biostatistics. Such a focused and comprehensive approach to the
evaluation and diagnosis of NIHF has not previously been performed, particularly in a large and diverse cohort,
and we expect that this work will significantly improve our ability to understand and reshape the perinatal care
for NIHF. Our work will lay the foundation for redefining the approach to prenatal diagnosis, in utero
management, and postnatal care for NIHF, and will create future opportunities to develop novel diagnostic
algorithms and in utero approaches to manage the complications of specific diseases underlying NIHF. Only
through this precision approach can we improve the course for fetuses and families affected by NIHF."

Autologous fat grafting (AFG) is a procedure whereby adipose tissue is processed and transferred from
one part of the body to another to add volume and address contour irregularity in soft tissue reconstruction.
Anecdotally, we see improvement in tissue fibrosis and pain with standard grafting after radiation treatment
indicating more than just a volume benefit of AFG. We have recently discovered that the transferred fat or
adipose brings in healthy progenitor cells, growth factors and immune cells helpful in tissue regeneration and
repair. Thus, purified graft is effectively a biological scaffold which can be modified to direct tissue healing or
targeted therapies. One of the hurdles to clinical translation is the variability in graft retention and our ability
to follow the graft over time. The long-term goal of our research is to investigate the capacity of engineered
adipose grafts to improve clinical outcomes by mitigating inflammation and promoting graft retention. We
propose a feasibility study investigating a novel imaging platform to quantitatively assess the overall volume
and three-dimensional (3D) shape of the breast after fat grafting in cancer treatment."

Salish Kootenai College (SKC) is a top tribal college that provides quality postsecondary
education for Native Americans in Montana and across the US. Previous funding has allowed
the SKC Life Sciences department to build a nascent Bachelor of Science program with a
Cell/Molecular Biology track and most recently an Environmental Health Sciences track.
Currently, it is the only program at a tribal college simultaneously offering both of these tracks
while emphasizing place-based research experiences for a vastly underrepresented minority
population across all scientific disciplines. Support of the current proposal “Advancing Resource
& Research Opportunities in Environmental Health Sciences (ARRO-EHS)” will further strengthen
an intensive academic and research ecosystem at SKC resulting in more competitive Native
American students for advanced degree programs in environmental health sciences. To
accomplish this, ARRO-EHS seeks to train up to 15 students over five years with the following
aims: 1) ASSOCIATE underrepresented students to an enhanced educational environment using
innovative student resource tools, continuous one-on-one mentoring with faculty and peers, and
wellness initiatives to promote student engagement, retention, and outreach opportunities to the
larger reservation community; 2) ACHIEVE environmental health science-focused and faculty
mentored internal undergraduate experiences that utilize High Impact Practices such as
competitive student-inspired research projects, CUREs (Course-based Undergraduate Research
Experiences) infused with novel cultural/traditional tribal knowledge, and a curriculum
supplemented with renowned guest speakers in environmental health sciences; and 3)
ADVANCE students to graduate programs through external research internships with existing and
new Tier-1 partnerships, better preparation for graduate program entry, and an “Indigenous
Leaders in Science” workshop to facilitate a diverse work force with confident and capable leaders
in the field of environmental health sciences with a unique tribal, environmental, and community
perspective."
10794397,"Abstract: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the leading infectious cause of birth defects in the developed world. By
some estimates, approximately 1 in 100 to 1 in 150 children in the United States will be born with congenital
CMV and up to half of these children may have long-term health consequences - including hearing loss, vision
impairment and mental disabilities. The highest risk for transmission to the fetus occurs after primary infection
or reinfection of the mother during pregnancy. Thus, a vaccine to prevent CMV transmission is considered a
highest priority by the Institute of Medicine. Unfortunately, the immune system does a poor job at controlling
CMV in epithelial sites of entry and shedding and it is unknown whether the immune system can regulate
dissemination. Thus, our long-term goal is to define tissue-localized pathways that support or limit viral
dissemination and transmission and the function of CMV-specific T cells in these sites. To address this, we
have used the natural mouse pathogen murine (M)CMV, which closely mimics human (H)CMV infection. Both
HCMV and MCMV are thought to use an oronasal route of entry and we found that MCMV persistently
replicates in the nasal mucosa, a natural site of infection. We hypothesize that tissue-localized mechanisms
contribute to this persistence and have identified novel pathways that are active in the nasal mucosa and
salivary gland (the major site of shedding). Specifically, extracellular adenosine modulated the function of anti-
viral T cells and the potent anti-inflammatory lipids known as Resolvins, which were induced in the nasal
mucosa by MCMV infection, modulated viral titers. However, T cells limited viral titers in the nasal mucosa and
our data suggest that they also restricted dissemination in hematopoietic cells. Thus, the central hypothesis of
this proposal is that T cells are limited in their ability to control of the virus in mucosal tissues by at least 2
tissue-localized pathways, but that resident memory T cells may be able to inhibit CMV replication and limit
viral escape from the mucosal tissue. Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that Resolvins and extracellular
adenosine induced by infection suppress tissue-localized immune responses to support long-term MCMV
persistence in the nasal mucosa and salivary gland. Specific Aim 2 will define the mechanisms used by CD4+
T cells to control viral replication in the nasal mucosa, determine whether T cells confine viral dissemination to
infected hematopoietic cells, and test whether resident memory T cells can restrict MCMV persistence and
dissemination in both resistant and susceptible strains of mice. Together, our studies will provide the first
picture of the interplay between CMV, T cells and tissue environment after nasal infection and fill key gaps in
knowledge about natural CMV infection and persistence in mucosal tissues."

Understanding how nature builds new traits is a fundamental goal of evolutionary genetics. Unbiased
experimental dissection of trait variation from the wild has to date used linkage or association mapping, which
are suitable only for crosses between compatible individuals of a given species. In the first funding period of
this methods-development R01, PI Brem developed RH-seq, an approach for the unbiased mapping of natural
trait variation that can be applied to reproductively isolated species. Our RH-seq projects in invertebrate test
cases have put the complex genetics of ancient traits within reach for the first time in the experimental
literature. We now want to advance strategies that investigate deeper themes in complex genetics between
species—namely whether evolution uses concerted molecular mechanisms across the loci underlying a
polygenic adaptation, and how these loci work together to drive phenotype. To test-drive these approaches, in
our first Aim we will use an ecologically relevant model system, a thermotolerance divergence between yeast
species that last shared an ancestor five million years ago. In our second Aim, we will port our ideas and tools
for interspecies genetics to mouse primary cells. The latter will use as a testbed a cell-autonomous, pro-
inflammatory aging program called cellular senescence, which we have found to diverge between between
sister species of mice. We will develop RH-seq for unbiased genetic mapping of senescence traits, and we will
pursue epistatic and molecular mechanisms of the underlying loci as a parallel to our yeast model. Together,
our yeast and mouse projects will advance methods for the analysis of polygenic traits as they differ between
species, and accelerate the dissection of such ancient characters in systems across Eukarya."

Genetic variants in the TRIO gene increase risk for neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) including
schizophrenia, autism, and related disorders. A cluster of NDD-associated variants selectively impacts TRIO
guanine nucleotide exchange factor domain 1 (GEF1) activity, which activates the Rac1 and RhoG GTPases,
but the downstream molecular mechanisms by which TRIO GEF1 activity regulates neuronal development and
whether they can be targeted therapeutically are not known. We discovered a key autoregulatory mechanism,
and showed that NDD-related genetic variants impact this mechanism to enhance or inhibit TRIO GEF1 activity.
Here, we propose to employ a novel construct that includes the physiologically-relevant autoregulatory elements
in a high throughput screen to discover and validate positive and negative modulators of TRIO GEF1 function.
These probes will be critical to advance our understanding of TRIO GEF1 function and its regulation, to probe
candidate disease mechanisms, and to potentially suggest novel therapeutic strategies to address a spectrum
of NDDs.
Aim 1. Identify positive and negative small molecule modulators of TRIO GEF1 activity. The GEF1 domain
alone catalyzes robust GTP exchange on Rac1 in vitro, whereas the SR6-GEF1 construct which includes the
adjacent spectrin repeats (SRs) 6-9 reduces GEF1 catalytic activity 7-fold. Introducing NDD-related SR variants
into SR6-GEF1 increases its activity, while variants in GEF1 domain reduce its activity, indicating that small
chemical changes dramatically impact GEF1 activity. We will use a HTS biochemical assay of 150,000
structurally diverse drug- and lead-like compounds to identify those that increase or decrease the SR6-GEF1
activity.
Aim 2. Verify and evaluate HTS hits using secondary assays. Hit compounds will be rescreened for
confirmation and run in assays lacking SR6-GEF1 to rule out false positives. We will verify hits by repurchasing
selected hits as dry powders and retesting their activity against SR6-GEF1. We will measure SR6-GEF1-
mediated activation of Rac1 vs. RhoG to determine the substrate specificity of the compounds and investigate
isoform selectivity for TRIO GEF1 by testing confirmed hits against a panel of neuronal GEFs. We will test a
select group of the most potent hits to address mechanisms of action, including KM and kcat for Rac1 and RhoG,
whether compounds bind SR6-GEF1, and how they impact SR6-GEF1 binding to Rac1 and RhoG.
Aim 3. Assess probe efficacy on TRIO GEF1 activity in cells and neurons. We will study a set of the most
potent and selective activators and inhibitors for their ability to penetrate cells and modulate TRIO GEF1 activity
using both a Rac1 biosensor and a quantitative readout of TRIO GEF1 activity on HEK293 cell morphology. We
will measure whether a select group of inhibitors recapitulates defects in dendrite development and synaptic
transmission resulting from reduced TRIO GEF1 activity. We have also generated CRISPR mice heterozygous
for GEF1-defective NDD-related TRIO variants, and will test whether activators can normalize deficits in dendrite
development and synaptic function in cultured neurons and brain slices from these mice."

Congenital defects affecting the formation of the skull roof, such as craniosynostosis or persistent fontanelles,
occur as a result of abnormal calvarial growth and differentiation. We lack a basic understanding of how calvarial
bones grow, which in turn impacts the position, patterning, and fusion of sutures, and thus etiology of these
disorders. The Harris and Atit laboratories have uncovered an unexpected and intriguing role for cellular sensing
of graded fibronectin matrix in preferentially regulating apical expansion of calvarial progenitors during mouse
development. When cellular lamellipodia are inhibited, mouse calvarial osteoblasts fail to appropriately migrate
resembling defects seen when we conditionally delete fibronectin. These findings are bolstered by data that
fibronectin is misregulated in patients with craniosynostosis as well as animal models of this disease. We propose
that graded fibronectin may act as a substrate for coordinated migration of calvarial osteoblast progenitors over
the skull roof. Our central hypothesis is that calvarial growth and suture patency are dependent on
fibronectin-directed calvarial progenitor cell expansion. Through three focused mechanistic and
translational aims, we will directly test this model and hypothesis of fibronectin substrate-mediated migration
underlying a diverse number of cranial pathologies. First, we will assess outcomes of altered fibronectin
expression in regulation of calvarial growth. Second, using newly established genetic lines in mouse and
zebrafish, we will test the dependence on fibronectin adhesion and the role of lamellipodia-dependent cellular
sensing of an extracellular gradient in apical expansion of calvaria. Third, we will capitalize on diverse mouse
models of craniosynostosis to assess commonality of fibronectin disruption in clinically relevant dysmorphologies
and whether decreasing fibronectin expression rescues craniosynostosis in in vivo. Our unique genetic tools in
both mouse and zebrafish will allow us to define the function of fibronectin-guided, lamellipodia-based, collective
cell movement in vivo during calvarial bone expansion and the impact of fibronectin deficiency on suture patency.
Results from these studies will help detail substrate-mediated cell migration of osteoblast progenitors and will
lead to new strategies for targeted therapies of calvarial bone defects and craniofacial disorders."

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a rising cause of mortality worldwide. Disease heterogeneity
is one major barrier to understanding and therapeutic development for COPD. Understanding the molecular
basis for this heterogeneity and determining the causes and consequences of the disease is a major challenge.
Genetic variants, present since birth, have the potential to serve as a causal anchor for disease-related pathways
and potential COPD subtypes. However, genetic variants often have small effect sizes and poorly understood
functional effects. Metabolomics has emerged as a critical biomarker for lung disease but has not been assayed
in lung and blood at a cohort level nor been connected to COPD genetic risk variants. In this proposal, we plan
an integrative genomic approach to identify genetically driven pathways of COPD, informed by metabolomics,
transcriptomics, and proteomics. First, we will curate existing and generate new genome-wide association
studies for COPD-related phenotypes and implement statistical and machine learning methods to identify groups
of variants displaying similar multi-phenotype association profiles. Second, to determine the molecular profiles
of these groups of genetic variants, we will use existing transcriptomics, proteomics, and whole-genome
sequencing data along with newly generated lung and blood metabolomics data in 1,000 subjects from the Lung
Tissue Research Consortium (LTRC). We will also identify relationships between the new metabolites data,
COPD and related phenotypes, and genetic variants and perform additional targeted metabolomics in 500
COPDGene subjects. Finally, we will assess the potential of these groups of variants to identify COPD subtypes,
gene-environment interactions, and potential drug targets. Altogether, our integrative analysis will produce
genetically informed molecular pathways and identify more specific groups of patients for therapy. In addition,
genetic association, metabolomic, and methodologic resources generated for this project will be of value to the
lung disease and complex trait genetics community."
10801052,"Abstract: We and others have shown that AAV vectors have great potential as gene therapeutic agents (3-5),
in particular for CF. Studies originating from our group led to the first use of rAAV in humans (7). Many pre-
clinical and clinical trials have shown that AAV vectors can be used safely (5,6,9). The major challenge, however,
is that they have not achieved a reproducible therapeutic effect, making it necessary to take a new approach to
AAV gene therapy. In previous work, we have identified three new strategies to alleviate these problems: 1) the
use of AAV1, which is more tropic for the lung; 2) use of 27-264, a truncated version of CFTR that corrects F508
by a novel mechanism; and 3) inclusion of a powerful chicken β-actin (CBA) promoter. Recent advances have
been made in developing corrector and potentiator compounds to rescue and activate F508-CFTR (8). How-
ever, although rescuing F508-CFTR would benefit many CF patients, there are more than 1000 other mutations
in the CF gene (http://www.cftr2.org/), many of which create mutant proteins that are not repairable by the same
compounds that rescue F508. These limitations in rescuing F508-CFTR and other mutant CFTR molecules
make it even more important to develop a gene therapy for CF to treat all patients with CF. To further explore
the potential usefulness of gene therapy for CF, we will use Rhesus macaques to explore the toxicology and
pharmacology of AAV1-CBΔ27-264. We will use a ferret model bearing the F508 mutation to evaluate rescue of
the CF phenotype in a large animal model. This model is ideal for our studies because ferrets show a tropism
for AAV1 similar to that of humans and monkeys (9), and the disease phenotype can be switched on and off
following application or cessation CFTR corrector/potentiator treatment. Finally, we will conduct a phase I clinical
trial in patients bearing the F508 mutation. We propose three overall Specific Aims:
Aim I: To evaluate single-dose administration of AAV1-Δ27-264CFTR to Rhesus macaques. Aim 2: To
determine the therapeutic effects of AAV1 vectors containing truncated CFTR in F508-del Ferrets. Aim
3: To determine whether dosing with an AAV1 vector containing a truncated CFTR will lead to transduc-
tion in ferret and human primary airway cells. The overarching questions for CF gene therapy are whether
gene transduction can rescue the CF phenotype and how long the therapeutic effect will last before a repeated
administration is necessary. The answers to these practical questions have enormous clinical consequences for
the development of effective CF gene therapy. This application will address the extent to which an AAV1 vector
containing AAV1-CBΔ27-264 will be effective in rescuing the CF phenotype and how long the rescue will last.
Significance: CF is an autosomal disease that leads to significant morbidity and mortality in patients with the
disorder (10). The work is significant because it will address the safety and efficacy of CFTR delivery via AAV1
viral vectors to lung and to demonstrate CFTR expression."

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of irreversible visual dysfunction in older
individuals although its underlying causes have not been definitively elucidated. Human cytomegalovirus
(HCMV) infection could be a risk factor for progression of AMD since there is a significantly higher association
of elevated anti-HCMV IgG titers with neovascular AMD compared to either “dry” AMD or healthy controls
while HCMV DNA has been identified in choroid/RPE samples from human cadavers. Our published and
preliminary studies have shown that: (1) systemic neonatal murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection of
both BALB/c and 129S1 mice spreads to the eye with subsequent establishment of latency in the
choroid/RPE; (2) retinal and choroidal pathologies, including deposits at both basal and apical aspects of the
RPE, CNV-like lesions, as well as degeneration of the choriocapillaris, RPE and photoreceptors occurs in
aged, infected BALB/c mice; (3) CNV lesions develop in eyes of aged 129S1 mice following systemic neonatal
MCMV infection; (4) hyperreflective lesions are present in the majority of infected, tamoxifen-inducible, RPE-
specific, SOD2 depleted 129S1 mice; and (5) RPE-specific, SOD2 depletion enhances spread of latent MCMV
to the RPE. Based on these findings we hypothesize that oxidative stress following light damage, activates
expression of ocular virus genes, which in turn, promotes production of inflammatory/angiogenic factors in
MCMV latently infected mice, thereby facilitating the development of AMD-like pathology, including CNV. Aim
1 will test the hypothesis that light damage and virus latency synergize to enhance the development of AMD-
like pathology. We will compare the development of AMD-like pathology in neonatally infected or uninfected,
aged BALB/c mice maintained under either low or regular-illumination. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that
oxidative stress in the RPE and MCMV latency synergize to enhance development of AMD-like pathology.
We will induce mitochondrial oxidative stress by depletion of SOD2 in RPE cells and determine the effect of
oxidative stress on expression of MCMV latency-related genes, production of inflammatory angiogenic factors
and the development of AMD-like pathology. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that release of angiogenic factors
by latently infected RPE cells is the mechanism by which latent ocular MCMV induces CNV. We will define
the location and identity of latently infected cells and quantify expression of MCMV latency-related and
inflammation/angiogenesis-associated genes in aged, latently infected eyes, both with and without CNV.
These studies will: 1) establish an in vivo mouse model of systemic neonatal MCMV infection and oxidative
stress, featuring the development of AMD-like pathologies; 2) increase our understanding of the synergy
between light damage, oxidative stress and virus latency in the development of AMD and 3) identify the
mechanism by which latent MCMV infection of the choroid, RPE and macrophages/microglia induce CNV."
10801055,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) affects 2.5 million Americans and is associated with high
morbidity and mortality. Few effective treatments are available. This proposal will investigate an important cause
of HFpEF: myocardial interstitial fibrosis (MIF). Hypertension, diabetes, and systemic inflammation lead to MIF
by activating fibroblasts, which secrete regulatory proteins that deposit, process, and cross link collagen fibers
in the myocardial extracellular matrix. Treatment of MIF is a potential strategy to prevent or treat HFpEF, but will
require scalable diagnostic tests and proven anti-fibrotic therapies.
Dr. Cunningham, a heart failure cardiologist and early career investigator at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in
Boston, proposes to study MIF using cardiac MRI, large-scale proteomics, and clinical trial methods. Preliminary
data show that inhibition of neprilysin (an enzyme which degrades natriuretic peptides) by the heart failure drug
sacubitril/valsartan reduces plasma levels of several extracellular matrix regulatory proteins. These results
suggest that neprilysin inhibition may attenuate MIF. However, it remains unknown 1) whether plasma levels of
extracellular matrix regulatory proteins are associated with MIF, 2) which extracellular matrix regulatory proteins
are modified by neprilysin inhibition, and 3) whether neprilysin inhibition reduces or slows progression of MIF.
In this proposal, Dr. Cunningham hypothesizes that plasma levels of extracellular matrix regulatory proteins
identify MIF and that neprilysin inhibition reduces MIF through its effect on these proteins. In Aim 1, he will
evaluate whether plasma levels of pre-specified extracellular matrix regulatory proteins are associated with MIF
measured by cardiac MRI in community participants from the UK Biobank. In Aim 2, he will investigate the effect
of neprilysin inhibition on plasma levels of these proteins in a previously conducted HFpEF randomized trial. In
Aim 3, he will conduct a pilot randomized trial directly assessing the effect of neprilysin inhibition on the most
reproducible marker of MIF, extracellular volume measured by contrast cardiac MRI. If successful, these studies
will form the foundation for future R01 applications identifying patients with MIF using proteomics and cardiac
imaging and evaluating the benefit of neprilysin inhibition or other anti-fibrotic therapies in these patients.
These specific aims are part of a comprehensive career development program designed to provide Dr.
Cunningham with the skills to become an independent R01-funded physician-scientist. Dr. Scott Solomon, an
expert in heart failure clinical trials at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and Dr. Patrick Ellinor, an expert in
cardiovascular epidemiology at the Broad Institute, will mentor Dr. Cunningham. Dr. Cunningham will develop
expertise in the biostatistical analysis of large-scale physiological data, the interpretation of cardiac MRI, and the
execution of heart failure clinical trials. Dr. Cunningham’s long-term goal is to lead clinical trials that leverage
physiological data to precisely target therapies to individual heart failure patients."

Dysfunctional perception and attention often accompanies and predates the onset of psychiatric illnesses
including obsessive-compulsive and anxiety disorders. Many of these dysfunctional responses appear in the
context of perceived threat and danger. The neurobiology of visual and attention systems has been extensively
characterized in animal models, resulting in extensive mechanistic knowledge ranging from the molecular to the
systems and behavioral levels. The proposed research aims to provide new empirically-based, quantitative, and
objective markers of specific perceptual and attention processes associated with obsessive-compulsive and
anxiety psychopathology. We aim to establish a dimension spanning from hypervigilance to perceptual
avoidance, hypothesized to discriminate between diagnostic categories but also predictive of transdiagnostic
variables such as severity and comorbidity. We will measure well-validated markers of sensory processing
(visual evoked potentials) and competition/attention (frequency-tagged steady state potentials). These data will
then be related to clinical data collected in a large sample of individuals presenting with symptoms on the
obsessive-compulsive and anxiety spectrum. A mechanistic computational model of perception and attention will
be used to aid in data reduction and to heighten reliability. Finding reliable and valid biomarkers of visuocortical
reactivity has the potential of transforming diagnostic assessment by providing continuous indices of specific
dysfunction. If the goals of this application are met, then reliable and valid indices of dysfunctional perception
and attention may help to significantly shift clinical practice. In assessment, objective measures of fear
conditioning could be used, for example, to objectively identify patients with hypervigilance, versus those with
avoidant dispositions. These inter-individual differences may also be relevant in the context of exposure-based
treatments and may represent novel means of assigning patients to individualized treatment protocols as well
as predicting treatment outcome."
10801394,"ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
 Perturbations of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis characterize alcohol use disorder (AUD).
The HPA axis is the primary stress-response system and cortisol is the major adrenal glucocorticoid hormone
in most mammals. A negative feedback system involving glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) regulates HPA axis
activity and cortisol secretion. Preclinical studies have shown glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonists reduce
alcohol (ALC) reward, withdrawal, and stress-induced relapse in preclinical studies. Despite this robust
literature, these areas are understudied in humans, perhaps because the only clinically available GR
antagonist, mifepristone, is not selective.
 The proposed rigorous crossover study will translate provocative preclinical findings implicating GRs in
AUD to humans using a selective GR antagonist, PT150. Participants (N=34, 17 females, 17 males) will
complete an experimental session after at least 5 days of maintenance on each PT150 dose (0, 450, 900
mg/day) to determine responses to experimentally induced stress. Participants will complete a separate
experimental session to determine if PT150 attenuates the pharmacodynamic effects of ALC (0.5 g/kg). We will
record behavioral (i.e., ALC demand, craving, mood, and subjective effects), neuroendocrinological (i.e.,
cortisol), and physiological (i.e., heart rate, blood pressure, breath ALC level) responses before stress or ALC,
and periodically afterwards for 120 mins. Finally, we will determine whether PT150 reduces ALC use (i.e.,
number of drinks and heavy drinking days/week), craving, and stress in the natural ecology. We predict: 1)
stress induction will increase cortisol, ALC demand and negative mood and PT150 will attenuate these
responses, 2) ALC will increase ALC demand and produce prototypical subjective effects and PT150 will
attenuate these effects, and 3) PT150 will decrease drinking, craving, and stress in the natural ecology.
Exploratory aims will determine if: 1) responses/changes differ in females and males; 2) baseline cortisol or
stress levels will predict behavioral or neuroendocrinological responses to stress and attenuation by PT150;
and 3) behavioral and neuroendocrine responses and attenuation by PT150 during the stress-induction
session predict changes in the naturalistic ecology.
 This project will expand the scope of clinical neuroscience research on AUD by focusing on GR
antagonism in humans. Rigorous preclinical research supports this proposal. The proposed research could
provide the impetus for subsequent clinical research to develop PT150 as an adjunct therapy for AUD.
Because HPA dysregulation occurs in stimulant, opioid, and tobacco use disorders, this project could also spur
interest in elucidating the role of GR antagonism in other substance use disorders. The proposed work will
produce an immediate and sustained impact."
10801457,"Hypertension is the most important modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), the leading cause
of death and disability in adults worldwide. Stigmatized populations, such as people of color and sexual
minority (e.g., gay/lesbian, bisexual) adults, have a higher prevalence of hypertension that is largely attributed
to greater exposure to stigma; a fundamental cause of health disparities. However, prior research on the effects
of stigma on blood pressure (BP) has primarily focused on enacted stigma (i.e., personally experienced
discrimination) to the exclusion of other forms of stigma, such as anticipated (i.e., expectation of encountering
discrimination) and vicarious (i.e., hearing/witnessing people like you being the target of discrimination)
stigma. Most research in this area has focused on the impact of stigma on BP due to a single stigmatized
identity. This current approach ignores intersectional stigma (i.e., stigma that is not attributed to a specific
identity), which obscures the experiences of groups that face stigma due to multiple stigmatized identities.
Given these limitations, we posit that researchers have previously underestimated the impact of stigma on BP.
We have compelling pilot data showing that, independent of enacted stigma, greater reports of daily
intersectional anticipated and vicarious stigma are associated with higher home systolic BP (SBP; a stronger
predictor of future CVD events than in-office SBP) among adults. The goal of this 1-week daily diary study is to
estimate the influence of intersectional anticipated and vicarious stigma on home BP. We will conduct the first
study to robustly examine mechanisms linking daily and chronic anticipated and vicarious stigma with BP in
individuals’ real-world environments. We will recruit a diverse sample of 400 adults (ages 18-64) without
diagnosed hypertension or CVD. Participants will complete a structured interview followed by 1 week of: (1)
twice-daily structured electronic diaries that will assess daily anticipated, vicarious, and enacted stigma, (2)
collection of saliva samples to assess salivary stress biomarkers, (3) continuous wrist-worn actigraphy, and (4)
twice-daily home BP monitoring. Our specific aims are to: (1) Determine the influence of intersectional
anticipated and vicarious stigma on mean home SBP and mediators of these associations (e.g., salivary cortisol,
anxiety) and (2) Examine differences in intersectional anticipated and vicarious stigma and mean home SBP
across stigmatized identities (e.g., ethnoracial, sexual identity) and the intersections between them. We will
also explore moderators (e.g., social support, identity centrality) of the influence of intersectional anticipated
and vicarious stigma on mean home SBP. This study will provide the first evidence of mechanisms by which
anticipated and vicarious stigma influence BP. If we find that anticipated and/or vicarious stigma influence
BP—even in the absence of enacted stigma—it will shift how we think about the design of interventions for CVD
risk reduction. This study is a critical step for identifying mechanistic targets for future interventions and
policies to reduce the adverse effects of anticipated and vicarious stigma on cardiovascular health."
10801458,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Abnormal responses to inflammatory stimuli can lead to severe inflammation, acute tissue damage, and long-
term scarring or fibrosis. One example is the rare disease fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), a
congenital disease of progressive heterotopic ossification (HO) that leads to severe and irreversible loss of
mobility. Patients with FOP show inflamed swellings (“flares”) that are associated with HO formation. Patients
with FOP have evidence of increased immune system activity, including elevated levels of pro-inflammatory
cytokines like IL1. Preliminary data from four FOP patients treated with anti-IL1 therapy showed a 60–90%
decrease in flare activity. We hypothesize that blockade of IL1 signaling reduces the flare activity and
subsequent new HO formation in patients with FOP. However, before we can perform a larger
interventional study, several key knowledge gaps and tools need to be addressed. We address these
needs via a clinical observational pre-post study on patients with severe FOP who are being recommended for
rescue therapy with anti-IL1 medications. Eleven subjects, aged 6–18 years old with at least six flares/year (3
times higher than the reported average flare rate) will be enrolled when their primary medical team recommends
initiating anti-IL1 therapy. Subjects will be monitored remotely to obtain pre-treatment flare rates and patient
reported outcome assessments. Once anti-IL1 therapy is initiated, subjects will begin their post-treatment
observational phase and have the first onsite visit for detailed assessments. Low-dose whole-body CT (WBCT)
imaging, bloodwork, patient-reported outcomes, pain, and flare activity will be assessed during the subsequent
year. Primary assessments: Determine if patients with FOP have decreased flare activity while on anti-
IL1 therapy. We will use flare diaries and pain scale assessments to systematically determine if flare frequency
and pain improve with anti-IL1 therapy. Aim 2: Secondary assessments: Determine the amount of new HO
formation in FOP patients treated with anti-IL1 therapy. We will develop a “ground truth” HO segmentation
that will serve as a basis for developing an automated artificial-intelligence analyses system. We will also
quantitate the new HO bone formation that develops in patients with FOP who are treated with anti-IL1 therapy.
Aim 3: Exploratory assessments: Determine if inflammatory cytokine measurements can be used as
biomarkers for monitoring flare activity and inflammation in FOP patients treated with anti-IL-1 therapy.
No effective biomarkers are available for FOP disease activity. We will determine if a commercial serum cytokine
panel and thermal imaging are useful tools for assessing flare activity. These studies address urgent needs.
No therapeutic options are available for FOP patients, particularly in children where intervention would have the
greatest clinical benefit. The proposed studies provide critical clinical information potentially relevant to the
immediate care of FOP patients and will generate key tools, such as methods for quantitative HO
formation from CT scans, that will be useful for a future U01-level study and patient care.

10802809,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Centrosomes, the major microtubule organizing centers in animal cells, are duplicated precisely once per cell
cycle to catalyze microtubule generation for rapid bipolar spindle assembly and ensure accurate chromosome
segregation. Centrosome amplification and fragmentation are frequently observed in cancer cells and are
thought to contribute to their chromosome instability and aneuploidy. Centrosomes are comprised of a centriolar
core that recruits pericentriolar material matrix to dock microtubule-nucleating g-tubulin-containing complexes
(γTuCs). Given the central role of centrosomes in cell division and their frequent aberration in cancer, there has
been significant interest in developing centrosome-targeting agents for cancer therapy. In this proposal, we
elucidate distinct centrosomal microtubule generation mechanisms that contribute to spindle formation and
address how the primacy of the centrosome as the dominant site for spindle microtubule generation is
maintained. The dominance of centrosomes as mitotic microtubule nucleation centers, which reinforces bipolarity
of the spindle, is ensured in part by the mitotic kinase PLK1, which independently controls expansion of the
pericentriolar matrix and matrix-anchored microtubule nucleation during mitotic entry. PLK1 executes both tasks
by phosphorylating distinct regions of the primary structural component of the pericentriolar matrix (CDK5RAP2
in humans, Cnn in Drosophila and SPD-5 in C. elegans). In Aim 1, we will pursue parallel biochemical and in
vivo approaches in the C. elegans embryo to determine how PLK-1 phosphorylation remodels the pericentriolar
matrix component SPD-5 to enable gTuC docking and activation. We will also determine how centrioles recruit
and organize the mitotic pericentriolar matrix and dictate its size, inspired by preliminary data indicating that the
mitotic pericentriolar matrix is not simply an expansion of interphase pericentriolar matrix, but is an independent
entity. In addition to phosphoregulation enforcing dominance of centrosomes as microtubule-generating sites,
the primacy of the centrosome is ensured by the ubiquitin ligase TRIM37, which functions as a “guardian of the
centrosome”. TRIM37 prevents rogue collections of centrosomal proteins from forming ectopic microtubule-
organizing centers. In Aim 2, we address how TRIM37 recognizes and suppresses ectopic centrosomal protein
assemblies, by focusing on its signature TRAF domain that is unique in the TRIM superfamily, its potential ability
to oligomerize, and its ubiquitin ligase activity. Centrosomes in human cells have at least two mechanisms for
microtubule generation that independently support spindle assembly: the well-studied pericentriolar matrix-
anchored mechanism and a pericentriolar matrix-independent centriole-anchored mechanism. In Aim 3, we
investigate the assembly and function of a specific type of ectopic microtubule-organizing center formed in
TRIM37 mutant cells that is independent of the pericentriolar matrix, concentrates core centriolar proteins, and
robustly supports spindle formation in the absence of centrosomes. This effort should shed light on poorly
understood pericentriolar matrix-independent mechanisms for spindle microtubule generation in human cells."

Acute lung injury in the form of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI)
after lung transplant remains a major clinical issue associated with high morbidity and mortality. Currently, no
methods exist for targeted treatment and rapid rehabilitation of lungs affected by ARDS. The majority of treatment
strategies remain supportive in nature and are associated with continued poor outcomes. We have demonstrated
breakthrough methods for treatment or prevention of acute lung injury via normothermic perfusion of isolated
lungs in the form of ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) for marginal donor lungs or in vivo lung perfusion (IVLP) for
ARDS. IVLP combines the benefits of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and EVLP to provide a platform
upon which injured lungs can be treated in vivo with targeted therapies in an isolated fashion without the potential
risks of systemic treatment. We have demonstrated the rehabilitative capacity of isolated lung perfusion with
Steen solution whereby sepsis-induced ARDS as well as IRI of transplanted donation after circulatory death
(DCD) lungs are attenuated. We have also demonstrated that Steen solution directly preserves pulmonary
endothelial barrier function and that inhibition of Panx1 or TRPV4 channels attenuates lung IRI via endothelial
barrier protection. Thus, this project will test the overall hypothesis that rehabilitation of injured lungs by isolated,
normothermic perfusion with Steen solution can be augmented by Panx1- or TRPV4-targeted therapy aimed at
preserving endothelial barrier function to attenuate vascular inflammation and improve lung function.
 We will test our hypothesis using porcine and murine models of IVLP and EVLP of lungs injured by
ARDS or IRI in three specific aims. Aim 1 will determine if isolated perfusion with Steen solution will
rehabilitate injured lungs and if inhibition of Panx1 or TRPV4 during perfusion will augment rehabilitation and
endothelial barrier function. Aim 1A will use a porcine, LPS-induced ARDS model to determine if IVLP provides
durable lung rehabilitation up to 24 hours after IVLP. Aim 1B will determine if IVLP rehabilitates lungs injured in
a porcine model of gastric aspiration-induced ARDS. Aim 1C will determine if EVLP rehabilitates murine lungs
injured by ARDS caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Aim 2 will use a porcine lung transplant model to
determine if rehabilitation of DCD lungs by EVLP can be augmented by treatment with Panx1 or TRPV4
inhibitor for successful transplant. Aim 3 will use in vitro models of LPS-induced injury to determine protective
mechanisms of Steen solution involving direct anti-inflammatory effects on alveolar-capillary barrier or
leukocytes. Our recent studies demonstrate the potential of IVLP for the treatment of severe ARDS,
representing a major paradigm shift in the management of ARDS. If successful, our proposed studies will
define IVLP as a novel platform for targeted therapy of severe ARDS and will facilitate clinical translation."
10806982,"Protein glycosylation is essential in all eukaryotes, from disease-causing protists such as malaria, to yeast and
mammals. Secretory proteins are N-glycosylated, O- and C-mannosylated, and/or glycosylphosphatidylinositol
(GPI)-anchored as they enter the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Yeast that cannot synthesize N-
glycoproteins or GPI-proteins are inviable, and mice with the same defects die as embryos. Glycosylation is
important in dengue and SARS-CoV-2 viral infections, and defects in glycosylation cause human disease. Thus,
deficient O-mannosylation of dystroglycan is a cause of muscular dystrophy and GPI deficiency in
hematopoietic human stem cells underlies the hemolytic disease paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.
Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDGs) are severe inherited diseases with neurological symptoms.
 Protein glycosylation reactions require the glycolipids mannosyl- and glucosyl-phosphoryl dolichol (MPD,
GPD) to act as sugar donors in the lumen of the ER. As these lipids are synthesized on the cytoplasmic side,
they must be flipped across the ER membrane to function in the lumen, a process requiring specific
transporters, termed scramblases, that have yet to be identified. Assays of the two scramblases in microsomes
and reconstituted vesicles, using natural lipids and short-chain analogs as reporters, reveal that transport is
bidirectional, ATP-independent, and highly structure specific, discriminating between structural isomers.
 We will identify the MPD and GPD scramblases using chemo-proteomic and bioinformatic approaches.
Deploying novel photo-clickable probes synthesized by the Häner group (University of Bern) we will determine
the MPD and GPD interactomes, that we hypothesize will include the scramblases. Our preliminary results
validate this approach: the MPD probe functions in ER mannosylation and photo-identifies specific yeast
microsomal proteins. Photo-adducted proteins will be identified by quantitative proteomics and tested for
scramblase activity in our reconstitution-based assays. Promising candidates will be validated in vivo by
evaluating phenotypes of yeast mutants. For GPD scramblase we will also identify candidates via phylogenetic
profiling, a bioinformatics method for assignment of protein function. This approach complements the photo-
identification strategy and has already yielded a list of GPD scramblase candidates for testing.
 This is a consequential proposal to discover critical players in ER protein glycosylation. Our extensive
experience in studying scramblases puts us in a strong position to tackle this objective. We discovered the
scramblase activity of Class A GPCRs and were the first to show lipid scrambling by a TMEM16 ion channel.
We now deploy in silico, biochemical and biophysical methods to elucidate their mechanism. We will use this
expertise in future work to reveal the molecular mechanism of structure-specific lipid scrambling mediated by
the MPD and GPD scramblases that we predict to be distinct from that of the currently known phospholipid
scramblases. At a biological level, our discoveries will reveal new genetic loci associated with CDGs."
10807960,"PROJECT ABSTRACT: Clinical guidelines, performance measures, and clinical trials for patients with type 2
diabetes mellitus (DM2) have traditionally focused on achieving certain levels of glycemic control. Yet, when
glycemic control is the main focus of diabetes care, important aspects of patients’ health and wellbeing may be
overlooked or undervalued. For patients with poor glycemic control, clinicians typically respond by intensifying
the regimen, all too often without attention to the workload this imposes on patients, their capacity to carry out
the treatment plan, or the contextual factors involved. As a result, diabetes and its treatment may disrupt and
interfere with valued activities and interests (i.e., cause worsening “illness intrusiveness”), and actually worsen
how a person feels or functions. The goal of our program is to promote a paradigm shift in DM2 care: from
reaching HbA1c targets to a whole-person approach that responds to the situation of each patient and reduces
illness intrusiveness. Here, we propose to test a novel intervention to treat DM2 focused on Quality of life,
Burden of treatment (medication administration, costs, and monitoring), Safety (reducing adverse effects), and
Avoidance of Future Events (acute and chronic diabetes complications) – the QBSafe approach. We have
previously developed an Agenda Setting Kit (ASK) for patients to use during their routine office visits. The ASK
is comprised of (a) a set of conversation cards designed to enable patients to identify aspects of QBSafe that
are pertinent to their situation and to share them with their clinician to obtain their input; and (b) materials that
help clinicians respond to patient concerns. We propose to conduct a clustered randomized trial at a
federally qualified healthcare center in New Haven, CT, and to randomize 10 primary care clinicians and 144 of
their patients with DM2 and HbA1c >8% to receive usual care with or without QBSafe ASK in order to achieve
the following: Aim 1: To determine the feasibility of the research procedures necessary to conduct a practice-
based randomized trial to determine the clinical effectiveness of QBSafe ASK in the care of patients with DM2.
Aim 2: Since a definitive trial will require some mechanistic evidence of efficacy, we will power this trial to also
estimate the extent to which usual care with and without QBSAFE ASK can improve: Aim 2A: Patient-reported
outcomes, principally illness intrusiveness (Illness Intrusiveness Rating Scale), as well as diabetes distress
(Diabetes Distress Scale), treatment burden (Treatment Burden Questionnaire), hypoglycemia, and global
quality of life (1-item analogue scale) at 6 months after the intervention. Aim 2B: Clinical outcomes measured
as change in HbA1c between baseline and 6 months. Aim 2C: Patient-centered diabetes judged by (a) rating
the audiovisual recordings of clinical encounters (including the time spent total and in discussing QBSafe
domains), and (b) patient satisfaction (using the ambulatory CAHPS survey) and clinician satisfaction (using
post-encounter survey) with how the encounter went. This work will provide necessary preliminary data for a
multicenter randomized trial to determine the clinical effectiveness of QBSafe ASK in diabetes care."
10930114,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Between April 2021 and March 2022, the U.S. endured over 100,000 drug overdose deaths. As the opioid
epidemic expands, the epidemiology of overdose is changing. Nationally, the rate of overdose in Black and
Latinx people is growing more than five times faster than it is among white people. Similarly, between 1999-
2015, the prescription opioid overdose rate among women increased at more than twice the rate for men.
While differences in opioid supply could explain some racial and gender disparities, the ways that we
implement opioid treatment could also drive them. It is therefore essential that we investigate how
implementation of policy and interventions to address the opioid crisis impacts health equity.
The Researching Effective Strategies to Prevent Opioid Death (RESPOND) is simulation model OUD and OUD
treatment delivery in a state. RESPOND leverages investments in expanded public health data infrastructure to
inform model parameters, and it catalyzes new uses of data from NIDA-funded implementation studies. We
use RESPOND to investigate the health benefits, costs, and cost-effectiveness of policy choices and health
care delivery models to prevent opioid overdose. In the previous funding period, we developed RESPOND and
published studies projecting public health and health economic impacts of expanding the availability of
medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) in a variety of settings. We are currently expanding RESPOND to
simulate outcomes in Kentucky, Ohio, and New York.
We now propose to enhance RESPOND to investigate outcomes among populations of special interest to
opioid response: 1) communities of color and 2) women. We will then use the model to investigate health
economic and health equity impacts of policies regulating prescribing for medications for OUD and innovative
care delivery models for people with OUD. We will perform distributional cost-effectiveness analyses, which is
an emerging and innovative method to investigate trade-offs between maximizing population-level benefits and
ensuring equitable distribution of costs and benefits. Our specific aims are:
Aim 1: To enhance the RESPOND model and calibrate it to race and gender stratified targets in order to
focus on populations of interest in the opioid crisis: people of color and women
Aim 2: To use RESPOND to perform distributional cost-effectiveness analyses of changing policies
regulating MOUD prescribing
Aim 3: To employ RESPOND to investigate the clinical, racial equity impact, and economic value of
interventions that support people who use drugs along each step of the OUD care cascade.
We use RESPOND to generate evidence to guide large-scale implementation of policies and interventions to
prevent overdose. In the coming 5-years we will continue to be leaders in the field of OUD simulation modeling
and will employ RESPOND as an important tool for justice in the opioid crisis."
10804926,"Women diagnosed with high grade serous ovarian cancers (HGSOCs) often suffer from disease relapse that is
resistant to platinum-based chemotherapy. Effective treatments are needed as patients often die soon after.
Chemoresistant tumors are enriched with poorly differentiated stem-like cells (PD-SLCs) that harbor unique traits
such as expression of stemness-related genes, enhanced DNA repair, and reduced expression of MHC class I
which allows them to escape chemotherapy and cytotoxic T-cells. For successful eradication of chemoresistant
HGSOC tumors it is imperative to get rid of both differentiated tumor cells as well as PD-SLCs. Natural killer
(NK) cells are innate immune cells that mediate strong cytotoxicity against PD-SLCs particularly those
expressing low levels of MHC class I. But endogenous NK cells are few in number and defective in many cancer
patients including women diagnosed with HGSOCs. To address this clinical challenge, our group has developed
a novel ex vivo platform that can expand and activate NK cells-coined super charged (sNK) cells for allogenic
cell therapy. These NK cells can be expanded exponentially and are not only durable but also functionally
superior to peripheral blood NK cells. In addition, unlike T cells sNK cells do not mediate GVHD or cause cytokine
storm syndrome. Together these qualities make these cells a powerful tool in targeting solid malignancies. Our
work demonstrates that ovarian tumors enriched with a poorly differentiated phenotype can be directly targeted
by sNK cells. In response to secreted cytokines by the sNK cells any remaining tumor cells become more
differentiated and readily targetable with chemotherapy. These findings provide a strong rationale for testing the
efficacy of sNK cells, alone and in combination with carboplatin in targeting platinum resistant HGSOCs. We
hypothesize that our proposed therapeutic sNK cells in combination with carboplatin will be more effective in
targeting platinum resistant HGSOCs enriched with PD-SLCs. To test this hypothesis, we will first test the efficacy of
sNK cells, alone and in combination with carboplatin in targeting a large panel of primary chemo resistant HGSOC
tumors in vitro and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) in vivo. This will help us understand the applicability of our
proposed therapeutic in a large number of patients with advanced HGSOCs. To investigate the potential biomarkers
of response to sNK cells, we will perform single cell profiling of tumor cells at the RNA and protein level using scRNA
seq and CyTOF to delineate the expression level of genes and gene sets associated with susceptibility to sNK cells.
Top ranking pathways here include MHC class I and stemness associated genes. These findings can help guide
selection of patients who may most benefit from this treatment in future clinical trials. We will also explore the
underlying mechanism that regulate the antitumor activity of sNK cells and carboplatin combination in targeting the
chemoresistant HGSOC tumors. Our focus will be to decipher the roles of TNFα and IFNγ secreted by sNK cells in
driving tumor cell differentiation and chemosensitization. Overall, findings from this proposed study may provide an
immediately applicable treatment option for women Veterans impacted with HGSOCs."
10809737,"Abstract: The severity and incidence of T2DM is directly related to hepatic lipid concentration. Even before β-
cell failure ensues, the severity of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is positively associated with
hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance. The hepatic vagal nerve plays a key role in glucose homeostasis
affecting both pancreatic insulin release and insulin sensitivity. Acutely eliminating hepatic afferent signaling
stimulates insulin release and decreases skeletal muscle glucose clearance, simultaneously resulting in
hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance. Conversely, acutely stimulating the hepatic afferent nerve inhibits insulin
release and improves glucose clearance. Until recently there was no evidence for a hepatokine that signaled to
the vagal nerve to alter glucose homeostasis. We have established that hepatic lipid accumulation dose-
dependently increases hepatic production and release of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory
neurotransmitter. Our data proposes that hepatocyte produced GABA stimulates insulin release and decrease
skeletal muscle glucose clearance by altering activity of the hepatic vagal nerve. To establish therapeutic
potential, we have shown that liver GABA transaminase knockdown decreases liver GABA release, restoring
insulin sensitivity and normo-insulinemia in diet-induced obese mice. Through clinical trials, we have highlighted
the translational impact of potentially targeting hepatic GABA signaling. In clinical samples, we have shown that
hepatic GABA-transaminase mRNA expression is positively correlated with serum insulin and HOMA-IR. In
these same clinical samples, we have shown that glucose disposal during a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp
is positively associated with mRNA expression of GABA re-uptake transporters and negatively associated with
mRNA expression of GABA exporters. We propose 3 Aims focused on our central hypothesis that GABA is a
hepatokine that can help explain the link between hepatic lipid accumulation and hyperinsulinemia and insulin
resistance in obesity.
 Aim 1: Assess how obesity, lipids, diacylglycerol, ceramides, and downstream signaling affect direction
 of flux through the GABA shunt and transport of GABA across the plasma membrane.
 Aim 2: Assess the glucoregulatory response to exacerbating hepatic GABA production in lean mice or
 limiting hepatic GABA production in obese mice.
 Aim 3: Assess the glucoregulatory response to knockout (loss) and adenoviral induced overexpression
 (gain) of hepatic GABA transporters in lean and diet-induced obese mice.
Impact: Validation of GABA as a novel hepatokine that affects serum insulin and insulin sensitivity in obesity
will provide new therapeutic targets to treat this disease."

The ongoing PROGRESS birth cohort is a collaborative study founded in 2007 by the Icahn School of Medicine
at Mount Sinai, Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, and the National Institute of Public
Health in Mexico. Over 16 years, PROGRESS has been supported by 20 NIH grants led by 15 different
researchers including 11 K awards. More than 30% of PROGRESS researchers identify as underrepresented
in medicine and science, demonstrating our commitment to a diverse and inclusive workforce—we are an
incubator for the next generation of environmental health scientists. In this proposal, we seek to expand our
understanding of the child and adolescent home exposome, because a large proportion of social and
chemical exposures occur in the home throughout the critical period of childhood. Combined with our extensive
collection of data characterizing the internal and chemical environments (e.g., air pollution, metal exposures),
our novel approaches to characterize the chemical and social home environment (bioethnographies, passive
sampling) will enable new research on the impact of these exposures on children’s health. Our longstanding
team includes expertise in exposure science, biostatistics, child health phenotyping, and cohort management;
here, we add new expertise in bioethnographic methods (Co-I E Roberts), public health economics (Co-I JL
Figueroa-Oropeza), and environmental sensors for community engagement (Collaborator R Toledo-Crow).
This proposal also funds our continued collection of standardized, validated measures to assess
neurodevelopmental, respiratory, and metabolic outcomes, enabling us to collaborate with other cohorts and
consortia focused on children’s environmental health. In recognition of the extraordinary range of skills of the
PROGRESS team, and to invest in the study’s long-term success by recognizing their talent and potential, the
former PI, Dr. Robert Wright, has transitioned leadership to MPIs Drs. Maria José Rosa, Megan Horton, and
Martha Maria Téllez-Rojo. Further, Dr. Wright will remain part of PROGRESS, providing access to his
organizational knowledge and cohort history. This transition enables the next generation of PROGRESS
researchers to build a modern, team-based cohort implementing programs to enhance participation and
retention, adapting to advances in social media, and assessing new life stage-based health outcomes and
exposures, as we prepare for future big data consortia research. This proposal links exposure scientists,
statisticians, social epidemiologists, anthropologists, economists, and pediatricians to create modern team-
based transdisciplinary science to follow PROGRESS children throughout the critical and understudied
adolescent period. Finally, this application offers the rare ability to link prenatal life to adolescent health
immediately, leveraging our high retention rates to extend cohort life stage coverage all the way to the
doorstep of adulthood. Thus, this U24 award is a unique opportunity that will ultimately inform interventions to
protect child health through adolescence, adulthood, and even further into the life course."
10931605,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In 2009 two laboratories independently discovered the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg) – a small
GABAergic nucleus that encodes negative reward prediction error via the inhibitory control it exerts over midbrain
dopamine neurons. Together with subsequent studies demonstrating a role for the RMTg in responding to
aversive stimuli, this work sparked new research investigating involvement of this region in the neurobiological
mechanisms underlying alcohol use disorder. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) plays a key role in regulating
alcohol seeking and taking behavior. Interestingly, our recent work revealed the presence of dense input from
the mPFC to the RMTg that spans both the prelimbic (PL) and infralimbic (IL) subregions. Studies manipulating
PL and IL activity at the subregional level suggest that these two regions exert opposing control over alcohol
seeking. However, the application of circuit-specific approaches is beginning to suggest a more complex picture
with differing roles across discrete cortico-subcortical projections. Combined with only a very superficial
understanding of the heterogeneity / uniformity of RMTg neurons, these conflicting data make it difficult to
develop hypotheses regarding circuit motifs in RMTg and the potential synergistic or dichotomous functions of
RMTg-projecting PL and IL mPFC neurons. Given the impact that recent data demonstrating the previously
unappreciated heterogeneity of the ventral tegmental area has had on functional understanding of this region, a
rigorous investigation of the RMTg is warranted. The aims described in the current proposal will combine circuit-
specific labeling with state-of-the-art connectomics approaches to characterize the effects of chronic ethanol
exposure on the RMTg and its cortical afferents at nanometer resolution. Acquisition of an RMTg connectome
will provide crucial insight into cell structure and synaptic patterns as well as a precise neuronal map of dense
cortical input to RMTg thought to play a critical role in top-down control over alcohol seeking. The resulting circuit
data will provide a foundation for future studies investigating the functional consequences of dependence-
induced synaptic reorganization by integrating subcellular anatomical findings with physiology and behavior."

Depression is the most prevalent neuropsychiatric condition in IV infection and frequently associated with
substance use disorders (SUD), including methamphetamine (METH) use disorder. Nevertheless, there is
an alarming lack of information on the interactions between HIV, SUD, and depression, emphasizing a
critical gap of knowledge on the mechanisms of HIV and/or METH impact on the development of
depression. The present application is focused on the role of the inflammasome in this disease. Based on
our preliminary results, we formulated the central hypothesis that HIV and/or METH-induced
inflammasome activation primes for the development of depression. Mechanistically, we will focus on the
dysregulation of the gut-brain axis in this process because the gut microflora is a potent activator of the
inflammasome and a producer of a variety of mood-influencing metabolites and neurotransmitters.
Moreover, there is strong recent evidence on the involvement of chronic neuroinflammatory responses and
the disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) influencing the development of depression. We propose to
evaluate the following sequence of events in a novel humanized mouse model infected with HIV and
exposed to METH: HIV infection/METH exposure → inflammasome activation → dysfunction of tissue
barriers (the gut and the BBB) → neuroinflammation → depression. Successful completion of this proposal
will meet the translation objective, which is to demonstrate that HIV infection and/or METH exposure
contributes to, and accelerates, the pathomechanisms of depression via the alterations of the gut-brain
axis, which involves inflammasome activation and chronic brain neuroinflammatory responses. The
significance of our proposal is within its focus on the leading public health problem in people living with
HIV (PLWH), namely depression. The mechanisms of HIV and/or METH-induced development of
depression are largely unknown, making the proposed studies innovative and likely to generate unique
data sets. The resulting discoveries may have significant epidemiological, economic, and social
implications. Knowledge of the underlying mechanism(s) whereby HIV and METH prime individuals to
depression may provide critically important and therapeutically relevant information to identify novel targets
for pharmacological intervention. Our long-term goal is to characterize how HIV and METH contribute to
the pathomechanisms of depression and, ultimately, prevent its development through a precision
therapeutic intervention."

Mutations affecting the activity or expression of cell type-specific DNA-binding transcription factors (TFs) are a
common cause for a range of human diseases and congenital disorders. Despite the established relevance of
TF function for human health, the inaccessibility of the developing embryo and the complexity of tissue patterning
in vivo has resulted in significant gaps in our basic molecular understanding on how mutations in TFs result in
organ-specific pathologies. An example for this is haploinsufficiency of OTX2 – an essential homeobox TF
expressed in pluripotent tissues of the early embryo and throughout nervous system development – which results
in several rare, poorly understood congenital disorders that affect neuronal, sensory, and endocrine components
of the central and peripheral nervous system (NS). An assessment of clinical case reports and the published
literature on OTX2 function in animal models let us to hypothesize that NS-specific pathologies downstream of
OTX2 haploinsufficiency are caused by dysregulation of gene loci controlled by neurodevelopmental cis-
regulatory elements and chromatin-associated protein complexes that are uniquely sensitive to OTX2 dosage.
Our long-term goal is to understand how molecular and cellular pathologies caused by OTX2 deficiency in the
nervous system can be effectively reversed. The objective of this proposal is to implement a tractable
experimental platform that combines custom modifications of the endogenous OTX2 locus with the directed
differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) to identify gene regulatory mechanisms employed by this
TF during NS development. To allow discerning gene regulatory elements such as distal enhancers and
associated gene loci controlled by OTX2 during human NS development we have engineered human pluripotent
stem cells to harbor a multipurpose degron allele for rapid depletion and efficient immunoprecipitation of
endogenous OTX2, which we will leverage to identify OTX2-dependent enhancers during early stages of ex vivo
human NS specification (Aim 1). In parallel, we will engineer a second multipurpose allele that will allow
identification of OTX2 interaction partners by proximity ligation and utilize it to discern OTX2 containing gene
regulatory protein complexes active in hPSCs and derivative NS (Aim 2). Together, our proposed experiments
will provide a workable molecular framework for OTX2-dependent gene regulatory networks in the developing
human nervous system, thereby helping to close important gaps in our understanding of OTX2 function in
physiological and pathological conditions."

A challenge in targeting the neurologic drugs to the brain is the presence of the blood-brain barrier
(BBB), a dynamic structure that prevents neurotoxic blood particles and pathogens from entering
the brain while simultaneously regulating bidirectional transport of nutrients and waste products.
Increasing our understanding of basic biology of the BBB is essential to improving existing
therapies and finding new methods of targeting drugs to the brain. Previous work has found tight
temporal regulation of the BBB by the molecular clock is necessary for efficient transport of
xenobiotics from the brain; however, there has not been systemic characterization of the particles
that are clock regulated nor do we have a good understanding of the regulation of this clock. We
propose to characterize a robustly oscillating human BBB model using clonal human brain
microvascular endothelial cells (BEC) with a circadian rhythm reporter and co-culture primary
human astrocytes, pericytes and/or neurons in a 2D system. We hypothesize that secreted factors
from pericytes and neurons are required for robust BEC rhythms, which regulate temporal gating
of nutrients and proinflammatory cytokines. First, we will determine molecular and cellular
components required for robust brain microvascular endothelial cell oscillation and the clock-
dependent molecular trafficking through the BBB. Second, we will study the bidirectional effects
of peripheral inflammation and BBB circadian rhythms. Ultimately, understanding timing of
molecular trafficking through the BBB may provide candidate serum targets for chronomedicine
and neurobiological treatments as well as generate insight into blood-effects on the brain."

Dating app facilitated sexual violence (DAFSV) includes sexually-based harms enacted through dating apps,
such as sending unwanted explicit sexual images, making derogatory comments, or threatening unwanted
sexual acts. Dating app users disproportionally experience in-person sexual violence (SV) which suggests that
DAFSV may be an important pre-cursor to in-person SV. However, DAFSV perpetration risk and protective
factors and intersections with in-person SV perpetration remain underexplored, especially among men who have
sex with men (MSM). MSM use dating apps more than any other population in the US, are also 6 times more
likely to experience in-person SV compared to heterosexual men, and report substantial barriers to help seeking.
A robust predictor of in-person SV is alcohol use, yet alcohol’s role in DAFSV perpetration among MSM has not
been examined. Thus, research is needed to understand associations between drinking patterns and DAFSV,
as well as the role of alcohol use on DAFSV in the moment. It is also important to identify moderators that
exacerbate (i.e., sexual minority stress) or protect against (e.g., LGB connectedness) alcohol’s potential effects.
The proposed study will address gaps in the literature by using a mixed-methods design to examine associations
between these factors among MSM. In Phase 1, we will recruit a national sample of MSM (N = 1150) ages 18-
50 with past 3-month dating app use for a cross-sectional survey with timeline follow-back (TLFB) to assess
DAFSV perpetration, alcohol use, sexual minority stress and protective factors, and in-person SV perpetration.
In Phase 2, we will conduct in-depth qualitative interviews with 60 MSM from Phase 1 who report DAFSV
perpetration and alcohol use to understand contexts in which DAFSV occurs, with the goal of identifying potential
ways to prevent DAFSV among MSM. The study aims are:
 1. To examine the intersection between DAFSV perpetration and in-person SV perpetration. Specifically, we
 will investigate the extent to which MSM who perpetrate DAFSV also perpetrate in-person SV during first
 meetings with partners met through dating apps [Phase 1 and 2].
 2. Aim 2. To examine the role of alcohol in DAFSV perpetration. Specifically, we will examine: a) whether
 MSM who drink more (vs. MSM who drink less) perpetrate more DAFSV [Phase 1], b) among drinkers,
 whether DAFSV is more likely on days MSM drink (vs. non-drinking days) [Phase 1], and c) among
 drinkers, how DAFSV perpetration incidents differ when MSM are drinking (vs. not drinking) [Phase 2].
 3. To explore risk and protective factors for DAFSV perpetration among MSM. We will a) investigate whether
 the relationship between alcohol use and DAFSV is moderated by sexual minority stressors and protective
 factors [Phase 1], and b) identify additional risk/protective factors (e.g., emotional states, motives, and
 situational factors (e.g., substance use) that characterize incidents of DAFSV perpetration [Phase 2]."

 For 25 years, we have investigated the genetic bases of familial and sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
among Caribbean Hispanics in the US and in the Dominican Republic, contributing samples and data to the
Alzheimer’s Disease Genetics Consortium and the Alzheimer’s Disease Sequencing Project. For this new
proposal, we intend to integrate the genetic analyses of AD in Caribbean Hispanics with deep molecular
phenotyping: epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics using whole blood, plasma,
cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissue where possible. Multi-omics data generated in this minority population will
be used to understand the effects of gene variants on disease, clarify the affected proteins and pathways that
underlie AD and for comparison to results obtained from similar studies in white, non-Hispanic populations such
as Accelerated Medicines Partnership – Alzheimer’s Disease.
 Compared with non-Hispanics, we have shown that Caribbean Hispanics are three times more likely to
develop AD by age 75 years. If they have family members with AD their risk is five times higher. From the study
entitled, “Estudio Familiar Investigar Genetica de Alzheimer” (EFIGA, RF1AG01543) we have clinical information
and biological samples in 701 families multiply affected by AD, including 5,932 individuals of which 304 families
(43%) have three or more affected relatives and 1,874 individuals with sporadic AD and 2,739 healthy controls.
We have begun recruiting members of the Caribbean Hispanic Religious Orders aged 60 years and older who
consent to blood sampling for DNA and plasma, lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid and autopsy at death.
Our systematic genetic analyses in CH have yielded putative variants in ABCA7, BIN1, CD2AP, CLU, CR1,
EPHA1, MS4A4A/MS4A6A, PICALM, SORL1, PINX1 and SRCAP, each of which has been replicated.
 To covert these genetic findings into meaningful applications to AD we now want to focus our efforts on
the relationships between the genetic variants and epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics.
From the existing cohorts of genetically characterized individuals we will assemble a new multi-omics cohort.
This multi-omics cohort of 1,000 individuals will identify systems-level alterations in AD and will provide insight
into the mechanisms underlying genetic variants, assist in identifying disease pathways, putative protein-protein
interactions and downstream metabolites that can be used to inform preclinical work, develop biomarkers and
eventually therapeutic targets for drug discovery. The overarching goal is to use a genetic variant-centered,
environmentally inclusive integration of multiple omics layers to identify specific causal genes and investigate
how they may perturb pathways leading to disease."

Project Summary/Abstract
 The availability of simplified and better-tolerated antiretroviral therapy (ART) drug combinations has
decreased disease burden in infected individuals and reduced transmission to their contacts. However,
treatment for HIV infections requires life-long antiviral therapy since current drug treatments do not lead to
“cures”. The single most significant obstacle to total HIV clearance is that of viral latency since the presence of
a silent HIV genome in human cells is not recognized as infected by the immune system or by any available
antiviral drugs. Thus, the largest challenge to the HIV/AIDS basic sciences research community today is to
determine targets and strategies to fully eradicate virus from the body by eliminating this reservoir pool of
latently infected cells.
 One strategy to eliminate latently infected cells involves activating the latent provirus with drugs
called latency reversal agents (LRAs) in the presence of suppressive ART, and then using immunological
methods to kill the cells newly-producing virus. However, we lack a comprehensive and complete
understanding of how HIV latency is established and maintained, and how reactivation occurs across cell
types. Importantly, no single genetic or chemical intervention has been able to induce activation of all latent
proviruses (or even the majority of them).
 This proposal describes a novel and powerful approach to understanding HIV latency based on an
innovative genetic screening method that we have developed called HIV-CRISPR that uses the packaging of
CRISPR guides into budding HIV to serve as a readout for the effects of host genes on HIV. This technique is
both high-throughput and comprehensive and our plan is to adapt to models of HIV latency. Because the
screening technology is versatile and can be done in many iterations, we will be able to adopt a strategy
based on combining genetic screens with low doses candidate latency reversal agents to identify synergism
between different pathways of HIV latency maintenance in order to find targets that more broadly activate HIV
from latency while at the same time providing a greater degree of specificity for the HIV LTR.
Moreover, we will develop methods this technique to primary cell models of HIV latency to better mimic how to
reverse latency in vivo. Finally, will also apply this screen to understand how drugs of abuse influence HIV
latency pathways."

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) are chronic autoimmune diseases of the joint
punctuated by periodic arthritis flares. Clinicians have long recognized that each affected person develops an
individual pattern of affected joints, and that this pattern remains stable over time through disease remission and
flares. We recently identified the presence of synovial resident memory T cells (TRM) in arthritic joints and showed
that they mediate arthritis flares. Correspondingly, depleting these cells ameliorates disease recurrence,
indicating that TRM can be targeted as a novel approach in arthritis therapy. The long-term objective of the
proposal is to define the mediators of TRM development and maintenance in the synovium and determine if these
pathways can be therapeutically targeted to treat arthritis.
The specific aims of this proposal utilize 2 complementary approaches in mice and human studies to identify the
mediators of synovial TRM development. Aim 1 utilizes a mouse model of inflammatory arthritis developed by the
PI to define the lineage and differentiation process of synovial TRM. Aim 2 utilizes a human synovial organoid
system to interrogate the impact of the synovial microenvironment, namely synovial stromal cells, on TRM
formation and survival. We expect that these studies will identify critical mediators of TRM development, which
may represent novel therapeutic targets for inflammatory arthritis.

her foundational knowledge of immunology to extend her skillset into antibody-coupled single cell sequencing,
bioinformatics, organoid models of human synovium, and CRISPR gene targeting. The proposal includes a
comprehensive mentoring and didactic plan that will allow her to successfully learn new skills and gain expertise

Long-term weight loss maintenance is seldom achieved by individuals with obesity owing to numerous
biological adaptations occurring in the post-weight loss setting, including neuroendocrine-mediated changes in
appetite/satiety and reduction of energy expenditure. Following weight loss, peripheral and central
mechanisms respond in a way similar to starvation by conveying a sense that energy reserves have dwindled,
activating a strong counter-response to increase caloric intake. Moreover, metabolic rate drops, further
compounding the propensity for weight rebound. Adolescents with severe obesity are not immune to the
vexing issue of weight regain; therefore, effective and scalable treatments are urgently needed.
Pharmacotherapy has the potential to prevent weight regain by targeting counter-regulatory mechanisms in the
post-weight loss setting. Unfortunately, only one obesity medication is FDA-approved for long-term use in
adolescents and is seldom prescribed owing to modest efficacy and notable side effects. Among the most
promising candidates in the pediatric pipeline is the combination of phentermine and topiramate, which is the
most effective adult weight loss medication currently available. The mechanisms of action are thought to
reduce appetite, enhance satiety, and potentially increase energy expenditure, making this medication
particularly well-suited for the purpose of weight loss maintenance since it targets many of the biological
adaptations known to induce relapse and subsequent weight regain. Our group has generated preliminary
data demonstrating that both phentermine and topiramate reduce BMI in adolescents with severe obesity and
have acceptable safety profiles. In this clinical trial, we will utilize phentermine/topiramate to target counter-
regulatory pathways responsible for weight regain after meal replacement therapy (structured meals of known
caloric content) in adolescents with severe obesity with a goal of enhancing weight loss maintenance and
improving co-morbidity outcomes. Importantly, we will maximize the clinical utility and overall impact of our
study by comprehensively characterizing the safety of phentermine/topiramate utilizing sensitive measures of
cardiac autonomic function, arterial stiffness, cognition, and bone health, as well as examine the extent to
which this medication counteracts mechanisms of weight regain."
10812387,"The intracellular protozoan Toxoplasma gondii is the most common cause of infectious retinitis in
the world. Ocular toxoplasmosis tends to recur and leads to vision loss in 25% of patients, especially
in children with congenital infection, the elderly and the immunosuppressed. Current treatment does
not improve visual function or prevent relapses. A better understanding of the mechanisms that
control ocular toxoplasmosis may result in novel therapeutic approaches against this disease.
 Autophagy is a constitutive process of lysosomal degradation. T. gondii must avoid targeting by
autophagy in order to survive within host cells. We showed that during invasion of host cells, T. gondii
induces EGFR signaling that results in avoidance of initial autophagic targeting. Recently, we found
that T. gondii causes sustained Src signaling that maintains activation of EGFR and Akt (inhibitor of
autophagy). Pharmacologic inhibition of EGFR triggers autophagic killing of T. gondii in previously
infected cells and protects against ocular toxoplasmosis. However, the protection is partial (EGFR
expression is restricted; EGFR is only partially responsible for Akt activation). In contrast, Src is
ubiquitous and low concentrations of a Src inhibitor ablates Akt activation and kills T. gondii. How
autophagosomes selectively target T. gondii (required for effective pathogen elimination) is unknown.
 The objective of this application is to examine the role of Src in avoidance of autophagic killing of
T. gondii, understand how autophagy selectively targets the parasite and determine the relevance of
this mechanism in resistance against ocular toxoplasmosis. The central hypothesis is that inhibition of
Src enables the activation of a specific protein kinase that triggers selective autophagic targeting and
killing of T. gondii promoting protection against ocular toxoplasmosis. In the first aim we will examine
how inhibition of Src triggers activation of this protein kinase in T. gondii-infected cells. This aim will
be pursued using genetic and pharmacologic approaches that block specific signaling pathways. In
the second aim we will examine the role of this kinase in selective vs bulk autophagy in T. gondii-
infected cells. In the third aim, we will examine the molecular events controlled by this protein kinase
that explain how autophagosomes selectively target the parasite. Both aims will be pursued using a
combined approach of confocal microscopy using antibodies against endogenous proteins, live-cell
microscopy using fluorescently-tagged proteins and electron microscopy. In the fourth aim we will use
an animal model of ocular toxoplasmosis and transgenic mice to examine the role of Src, the protein
kinase controlled by Src and autophagy in ocular toxoplasmosis. The proposed work will further our
understanding of how host cell signaling regulates autophagic targeting of T. gondii and the outcome
of the infection, and may lead to adjunctive approaches to improve the treatment of toxoplasmosis."

Immune checkpoint inhibition emerged as promising cancer treatment strategies. However, only a subset of
patients respond to these therapies at present. Significant clinical evidence indicates that abundant tumor
infiltration of effector T cells and B cells is a prerequisite for the success of the immune checkpoint inhibition
therapies. However, these lymphocytes are largely excluded from many patients' tumors, which makes the tumor
unresponsive to the immunotherapies. High endothelial venules (HEV) are specialized venules that serve as
gateways for naïve lymphocyte recruitment, and these blood vessels can develop ectopically in tumors. High
HEV density in tumors correlate with favorable clinical outcomes, suggesting that the promotion of intratumoral
HEV formation would offer a novel opportunity to improve immunotherapies. The small GTPase R-Ras balances
angiogenic sprouting and vessel maturation, and normalizes tumor blood vessels. Several lines of evidence
indicate the importance of R-Ras for the formation of intratumoral HEVs. We hypothesize that intratumoral HEVs
shape the tumor immune landscape through efficient recruitment of lymphocytes, thereby creating the
immunostimulatory microenvironment favorable for immune checkpoint inhibition therapies. We propose a critical
role of R-Ras in this process by facilitating HEV formation in tumors.
Using novel genetic models of loss- and gain-of-function of R-Ras in endothelial cells, Aim 1 will demonstrate
that R-Ras facilitates the formation of HEVs within the tumor vasculature and determine how these HEVs affect
the tumor infiltration of T cells, B cells, dendritic cells, and other immune cell types in immunogenic mouse
mammary tumor and melanoma. The influence of intratumoral HEVs on cytokine environment will also be
determined. The analyses will be conducted by immunofluorescence, ELISA, FACS, and RNAseq. Clinical
cancer specimens will be examined to corroborate the findings from the mouse studies. Aim 2 will functionally
characterize tumor HEVs and analyze intratumoral priming of HEV-recruited T cells to a specific antigen using
adoptive transfer of naïve OT-1 T cells to OVA-expressing tumors. Aim 3 will determine how intratumoral HEVs
impact the immune destruction of tumors and the responsiveness to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition therapies.
As the gateways for T cell/B cell recruitment to tumors, intratumoral HEVs are potential new targets to reprogram
the tumor immune landscape and to improve patients' response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. The expected
outcome of this study will provide the proof-of-concept for such ideas."
10814974,"Mississippi is among the leaders in mortality due to heart disease, stroke, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and
kidney disease. Mississippi also has the greatest health care disparities in the country along with limited
extramural research support necessary to recruit and retain top biomedical researchers that can address these
important issues. These widening health care disparities affect underrepresented minorities, including African
Americans and Hispanic Americans, who are disproportionately affected by heart disease, stroke, diabetes,
nephritis/nephrosis, hypertension and hypertension related renal diseases. Therefore, a unique opportunity
exists in Mississippi for building diverse research infrastructure to investigate mechanisms and new treatment
options for cardiovascular and renal diseases at the very location where they are most prominent in the United
States. This application proposes to continue a highly successful summer research program in the State of
Mississippi that increased the participation of individuals from underrepresented minorities (URM) in
hypertension, renal and cardiovascular related biomedical fields over the last five years. The Mississippi
Diversity in Hypertension and Cardiorenal Research Program (MSDHCR) supported over forty URM students
in the first funding cycle, with greater than 90% of graduates utilizing their science degree in graduate school,
professional school, or in their employment. The University of Mississippi Medical Center (UMMC) has a long
history of excellence in cardiovascular and renal research, and mentoring. The current proposal seeks an
additional five years for the MSDHCR program, and represents a critical component of the mission to train and
mentor cardiovascular and renal researchers. This competitive renewal includes enhanced institutional
support and innovative improvements that ensure the continued development of a robust biomedical pipeline.
The overall objective of this training program is to provide career and education mentoring along with state-of
the art cardiovascular and renal research training experiences to individuals with disadvantaged and
underrepresented ethnic or racial backgrounds in the cardiovascular and renal sciences. Undergraduate
students from disadvantaged and underrepresented backgrounds will participate in this program that has the
following aims: 1. To provide program participants a multi-disciplinary training and mentoring experience in
cardiovascular and renal research. 2. To provide program participants with opportunities for professional
development that will help them achieve careers in health-related research professions. 3. To provide
standardized test training for program participants that will prepare them for the next steps in their educational
training."
10814987,"Project Summary/Abstract
Chronic low back pain is a debilitating disorder of significant socio-economic importance and a major gateway
to opioid use. Therefore, minimally invasive non-addictive treatments that aim to address pain by targeting the
underlying disease pathology are critical to improve human health and limit the growing opioid crisis.
Intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration is strongly associated with the pathophysiology of chronic low back pain;
specifically extracellular matrix (ECM) breakdown, inflammation, and aberrant nerve/vascular ingrowth, all of
which are significantly correlated with “Discogenic back pain” (DBP). Therefore, the overall objective of this
proposal is to develop novel non-viral reprogramming-based therapies to convert degenerate nucleus
pulposus (NP) and annulus fibrosus (AF) IVD cells associated with DBP, into a healthy pro-anabolic,
anti-nerve/vascular phenotype, using engineered extracellular vesicles (eEVs). Our central hypothesis is
that non-viral reprogramming will restore IVD structure/mechanical function, and limit nerve/vascular ingrowth
associated with pain, by converting the patient’s own degenerate IVD cells into a pro-anabolic phenotype in situ.
 To date, clinicians do not have access to the necessary biological tools to treat IVD degeneration in patients
with DBP. A critical barrier to the success of current biologic strategies involves significant logistical and
regulatory challenges such as a lack of sustained drug delivery systems, poor long-term cell viability or viral
reprogramming that permanently integrates with the host DNA. Our non-addictive strategy focuses on
addressing these limitations. Through our recent R61 award and published work, we have shown that human
NP cells can be reprogrammed towards a healthier phenotype using developmental transcription factors
Brachyury or FOXF1, showing increased ECM accumulation and decreased catabolic/ inflammatory/
neurotrophic factors - all key features of a healthy IVD. Furthermore, in our mouse DBP in vivo model we have
also demonstrated significant improvement in NP tissue hydration and dampened pain behaviors in animals
treated with eEVs loaded with FOXF1 for up-to 12 weeks, highlighting the potential of our proposed strategy to
restore structure/function of the IVD while reducing pain. However, critical gaps remain such as i) understanding
the synergistic reprogramming potential of multiple developmental transcription factors in NP and AF cells, ii)
how sex and age influence our strategy, and iii) evaluating therapeutic efficiency using more clinically relevant
in vivo animal models that simulate the human condition and functionalized eEVs to deliver transcription factors
to specific cell types within the IVD (for example, NP or AF cells).
 Our first aim investigates the synergistic effects of eEVs loaded with multiple transcription factors using in
vitro and in vivo clinically relevant models of DBP, and quantifying efficacy of our strategy via assessment of IVD
structure/function and pain markers. The second aim involves functionalizing the eEVs with ligands specific for
NP or AF cells to selectively deliver cargo to degenerate NP or AF cells of the IVD in vitro and in vivo."

organizations’ clinical and research operations. We propose to address this need by creating a
Pediatric LHS Embedded Scientist Training and Research Center. The Center will be integrated
within PEDSnet, a PCORnet Clinical Research Network and a national pediatric LHS with 11
institutional members that provide care for 10% of the nation’s children. The Center will extend and
enhance the successful PEDSnet Scholars program, which is an AHRQ LHS Center of Excellence
(K12) and has trained 29 junior faculty. The aims for the Center are: Aim 1 (Center Organization and
Integration): Establish a national, pediatric embedded LHS scientist training and research center with
administrative, education and training, research and data analysis, and scientist development cores;
Aim 2 (Scholar Development): Select, retain, and mentor a diverse cadre of pediatric scientists, called
PEDSnet Scholars, who are within 5 years of their initial academic appointment or those making a
mid-career transition, creating a community of national leaders who will help realize the promise of
LHS science for children; Aim 3 (Education Program): Deliver a core curriculum that builds
competence in LHS science with an emphasis on authentic stakeholder engagement and patient-
centered outcomes research; Aim 4 (Research Support): Provide project management, engagement,
methodological, and dissemination and implementation resources and support to PEDSnet Scholars
and their research projects; and, Aim 5 (Program Evaluation): Evaluate the impact of the Center and
its activities on scientists’ professional development and patient and system outcomes. We anticipate
using AHRQ/PCORI funding for 14 individuals and up to an additional 16 can be funded by their
institutions. Scholars will conduct projects that are meaningful, impactful, and outcomes-focused
addressing health and healthcare challenges facing children, their families, and the health systems
that serve them. We have added a Scientist Development Core, which will implement an innovative
Diversity Plan, mentoring, and all activities related to Scholar professional development. The three
MPIs have complementary expertise and are national leaders in LHS science, multi-institutional
research, faculty training, enhancing workforce diversity, and the science of health equity. The
PEDSnet Scholars working within the Center will become institutional and national leaders in
advancing outcomes and the leaders who will forge the national pediatric LHS system of the
future. The PEDSnet Scholars program is not a project for PEDSnet or its member institutions; it is
part of a strategic campaign to create an integrated LHS for the nation’s children."

10815359,"ABSTRACT: OVERALL
Rehabilitation and long-term services and supports (LTSS) are high-value, effective interventions for improving
the lives of persons with disability and chronic conditions. As with most health care, inequities in access to and
quality of rehabilitation and LTSS exist. Efforts to address these inequities have never been more important,
given that chronic conditions affect more than half of U.S. adults, with 27% having multiple chronic conditions
(MCC), and one in four US adults living with a disability. MCCs are associated with preventable and high
healthcare costs, hospitalizations, emergency department utilization, and disability. Chronic conditions are
costly, accounting for 75% of US healthcare dollars. Furthermore, the proportion of persons living with MCC
and/or disability is steadily increasing, disproportionately affecting persons 65 years and older, those living in
poverty, and those from some racial or ethnic minority groups. A learning health systems (LHS) approach
offers potential solutions to minimizing disparities in rehabilitation and LTSS, by embedding knowledge and
best practices into care delivery, thereby supporting improvement, innovation, and equity. This application
seeks to create the Learning Health systems training to improve Disability and chronic condition care (LeaHD)
center which will build upon an established, NIH-funded P2C resource center, the Learning Health Systems
Rehabilitation Research network (LeaRRn). LeaHD’s long term goal is to improve the health-related quality of
life of persons with disability and chronic conditions by improving access to and quality of rehabilitation and
LTSS. Our overarching objective is to train embedded scientists to conduct PCOR/CER and dissemination and
implementation (D&I) research that will inform improvements in health system operations, quality of care, and,
thus, health outcomes for persons with disability and chronic conditions. LeaHD will build upon a well-
established infrastructure and collaborative relationships at Brown University, University of Pittsburgh, and
Boston University, faculty expertise and nine health system partners. Our specific aims are to: 1) establish
meaningful and inclusive health system partnerships to identify and develop important questions focused on
rehabilitation and LTSS for persons with disability and chronic conditions; 2) recruit and develop a diverse
cadre of highly-skilled scientists poised to conduct embedded research; 3) leverage existing resources to
provide mentored training for embedded scientists through core LHS research training, individualized training
plans, and experiential learning; 4) facilitate embedded PCOR, CER, and D&I research through mentorship
and methodological and operational expertise and support; and 5) utilize a comprehensive evaluation
framework to assess LeaHD’s impact on embedded scientist professional development, health systems
operations, and individual, family, and community-level outcomes."

partners; 2) develop and execute a recruitment and retention plan, solicit proposals, review applications, and
submit required regulatory documents for research projects; and 3) employ clear outcome and impact metrics
to evaluate and document LeaHD activities. The AC will establish and lead activities of the LHS Innovation Hub
of nine engaged health system partners, and serve as a point of contact for LeaHD activities. The AC will
facilitate communications with both internal and external parties. It will develop and maintain a contact
database, website, and a strong social media presence. The AC’s comprehensive plan to recruit and retain a
diverse pool of applicants for scientist positions will be enhanced through the input of a Recruitment and
Outreach Advisory Committee and will be strengthened by a Community Outreach Network of external
partners who are committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts relative to the workforce serving persons
with disability and chronic conditions. The AC will develop calls for LeaHD scientists, coordinate review and
selection, and collaborate with the Research Education Core (REC) to develop a strategy for ensuring viability
of mentoring and training relationships. The AC will communicate with mentors, and finalize plans for
supporting mentoring activities. The AC and REC will work together to oversee completion of individualized
development plans and mentoring agreements. The AC will work with the Research and Data Analysis Core
(RDAC) to plan for PCOR/CER project solicitation, review, selection, and resource requirements. Finally, the
AC will implement a comprehensive program evaluation that employs clear impact metrics. The AC’s success
will be facilitated by its strong and experienced leadership, and established, effective collaborations between
PIs, co-investigators, and partner health systems institutions. Linda Resnik, PT, PhD will serve as AC Principal
Investigator. Dr. Resnik is the Director of two research and training centers, the NIH-funded Learning Health

10815532,"Project Abstract/Summary
 Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States. Overall survival for patients with tumors
that remain localized to the tissue of origin remain relatively high, while it is estimated that 90% of all cancer
related deaths are due to metastatic dissemination to secondary sites. This underscores the importance of
identifying signaling pathways that promote metastasis. Mitochondria are multifunctional organelles with
important roles in regulating many cellular processes outside of ATP production and are recognized for their
roles in tumorigenesis and metastasis. This project seeks to define a novel mechanism that promotes tumor cell
invasion and metastasis through a previously unidentified signaling pathway between Mitochondrial Rho GTPase
2 (MIRO2) and atypical myosin IXB (MYO9B).
 MIRO2 is an outer-mitochondrial membrane protein that is a part of the MIRO subfamily of Ras GTPases.
MIROs were first characterized in neurons where they are involved in the anterograde and retrograde trafficking
of mitochondria. MIRO2 has been shown by several groups to be dispensable for mitochondrial trafficking in
many non-neuronal cell types. Our lab has previously shown that MIRO2 mRNA is enriched in tumorigenic
tissues in many tumor types when compared to normal tissue. Additionally, we have shown in prostate cancer
that MIRO2 is important in tumor cell viability, anchorage-dependent and -independent growth, and tumor growth
in vivo. Despite this initial evidence, it remains unknown if MIRO2 exclusively impacts the primary tumor or if this
is also important in metastasis. My initial results show that loss of MIRO2 reduces the invasive capacity of tumor
cells from many tumor types including breast, melanoma, pancreas, and prostate. Furthermore, I have shown
out of the top newly identified MIRO2 binding partners, loss of MYO9B reduces invasive capacity to the greatest
extent. MYO9B is known to control cell motility by localizing to the leading edge of migrating cells and inactivating
RhoA through MYO9B’s Rho GTPase activating protein (GAP) domain. Excitingly, I show that loss of both MIRO2
and MYO9B result in increased active RhoA. Given this evidence, I hypothesize MIRO2 promotes tumor cell
invasion and metastasis through positively regulating MYO9B GAP activity.
 In this proposal I will 1) determine the role of MIRO2 in tumor cell invasion and metastasis and 2)
determine the mechanism in which MIRO2 regulates tumor cell invasion. This proposal will utilize many models
including, but not limited to: 2D/3D in vitro invasion systems, live cell imaging of migrating cells, in vivo breast
cancer metastasis models, cell-free GTPase assays, co-immunoprecipitation, and proximity ligation assays.
Overall, the goal of this proposal is to serve as the basis for the development of novel therapeutics to target
metastatic disease."
10817166,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Myocardial infarction (MI) is one of the most common forms of cardiac injury. In a MI, coronary artery
occlusion leads to a local restriction of blood and oxygen supply to the myocardium, causing many immediate
and long-term changes throughout the myocardium that often manifest as arrhythmias or heart failure. Thus, a
more detailed understanding of the remodeling processes that occur both local and distant to hypoxic injury are
critically needed to develop new therapies for mitigating the progression to heart failure after MI. Recent
studies have shown that hypoxia alters the cargo found in exosomes secreted by both cardiac fibroblasts and
myocytes. This suggests that hypoxic and normoxic cardiac cell types could communicate via exosomes in
post-MI myocardium. However, the effects of exosomes secreted by hypoxic cardiac cells on normoxic cardiac
cells (and vice versa) is poorly characterized, in large part due to a lack of experimental tools. For example, the
state-of-the-art for investigating hypoxia in vitro is to modulate oxygen globally with an incubator or hypoxia
chamber. This approach does not mimic the oxygen gradients that are characteristic of post-MI myocardium
and therefore precludes the investigation of ongoing cell-cell communication between normoxic and hypoxic
cells, which could be a key mechanism of myocardial remodeling post-MI. We hypothesize that localized
hypoxia affects the phenotypes of cardiac cells locally due to the direct effects of oxygen, and distally due to
cell-cell communication between hypoxic and normoxic cells, mediated primarily by exosomes. To test this
hypothesis, we will first fabricate a new microphysiological system that: (1) implements microfluidic gas supply
channels to generate oxygen gradients; (2) has modular cell culture chambers to regulate cell-cell contact and
paracrine signaling; and (3) integrates assays for quantifying cardiac fibroblast and myocyte structural and
functional phenotypes, including existing “Heart on a Chip” contractility assays previously advanced by the PI.
We will then implement these devices for three Aims. In Aim 1, we will measure how oxygen gradients affect
cardiac fibroblast phenotype, exosome RNA and protein cargo, and the activity of the oxygen-sensitive
transcription factors, HIF-1 and HIF-2. In Aim 2, we will perform similar studies with cardiac myocytes and
quantify functional phenotypes by integrating our “Heart on a Chip” assays for measuring propagation velocity
and contractile stress. In Aim 3, we will characterize cross-talk between hypoxic fibroblasts and normoxic
cardiac myocytes, as well as hypoxic cardiac myocytes and normoxic fibroblasts. Together, our innovative
microphysiological systems and rigorous experimental approaches will reveal significant new insights into the
effects of localized hypoxic injury on the phenotypes of cardiac cell types, relevant to understanding myocardial
remodeling post-MI. Our data will also establish new paradigms related to cell-cell communication pathways in
hypoxia that are mediated by exosomes, which could be leveraged therapeutically. Additionally, our new
devices could be used for medium-throughput screening of compounds for mitigating the effects of hypoxia."

Neuroimaging has expanded our understanding of brain development from childhood into early adulthood.
Adolescent substance use trends have shifted over time, but use of cannabis, alcohol, and tobacco remain
prevalent, typically starting during teenage years, when serious mental health conditions also tend to emerge.
Although physical health is at its lifetime peak, emerging concerns for teens include increasing rates of
depression, anxiety, social isolation, suicidal ideation, and excessive use of screen media. The extent to which
early substance use and other environmental exposures may place youth at risk for altered neurodevelopment
and adverse outcomes remains poorly understood.
A diverse sample of 11,878 9-10 year olds was enrolled from 21 sites across the ABCD Study consortium
under RFA-DA-15-015. All participants underwent a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-
the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, bioassays, careful assessment of substance
use, mental health, physical health, culture and environment, and mobile monitoring every 2 years. Interim in-
person annual interviews and biannual telephone or mobile app assessments provide refined temporal
resolution of behaviors, development, and life events with minimal participant burden. Intensive efforts are
made to retain the vast majority of participants through adolescence and beyond and retention rates thus far
are very high.
Data, securely and privately shared with the scientific community, will enable investigators to: (1) describe
individual developmental trajectories in terms of neural, cognitive, emotional, and academic functioning, and
influencing factors; (2) develop national standards of healthy brain development; (3) investigate the roles and

 Latino immigrants experience numerous disparities in the receipt of routine health care. They are at risk
for significant poor outcomes from cardiovascular disease; however, the extent to which Latino immigrants
experience appropriate cancer screening and prevention services, compared with US born-Latinos and non-
Hispanic whites, is not well understood. This may be, in part, because studying the health care of Latino
immigrants has numerous challenges. Foreign-born status is not widely and routinely collected, and foreign
born patients may not have the access to healthcare related datasets that would objectively record their
healthcare utilization. Additionally, there is some scientific evidence that different sub groups of immigrants
may receive different services; specific ethnic subgroup (Mexican individuals, for instance), Spanish speaking
individuals, rural- residing immigrants may utilize services differently than contrasting groups. However,
knowledge on these differences is incomplete because studies to date have failed to include all necessary data
to understand these relationships.
 In order to better understand cardiovascular prevention disparities between foreign-born Latinos, US-
born Latinos, and non-Hispanic Whites, we will leverage a unique data resource from a large, national network
of community health centers with shared electronic health record data that is linked to community-level social
determinants of health data. This large, longitudinal dataset contains country of birth for >87,000 Latinos and
also contains unprecedented data linkages which will let us assess disparities and better understand which
specific groups are most at risk for the under-utilization of cardiovascular prevention. Understanding these
factors that most heavily impact cardiovascular preventive service use is crucial to the prioritization of
population-based interventions to improve cardiovascular outcomes.
 This research will enable action/intervention in three ways: 1. It will enable more informed policy
decisions to improve public health and wellness in foreign born Latinos. 2. It will facilitate strategic partnerships
between healthcare providers and community agencies poised to intervene in social factors in the lives of
Latino immigrants. 3. It will help clinical providers understand their patients' barriers to care utilization, and
further point-of-care efforts to address these barriers that influence their Latino immigrant patients' utilization of
recommended cardiovascular prevention services."

Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) is the largest long-term study of brain development and child

607 being followed in Baltimore, and will track their biological and behavioral development through
adolescence into young adulthood.
All participants received a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging,
neuropsychological testing, bioassays, careful assessment of substance use, mental health, physical health,

understanding of brain development from childhood into adulthood. Using this and other cutting-edge
technologies, ABCD can determine how different kinds of youth experiences (such as sports, school
involvement, extracurricular activities, videogames, social media, unhealthy sleep patterns, and vaping)

10817079,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Lung cancer is one of the most common and deadliest malignancies in the world. Radiation therapy (RT) is
often used alone or in combination with surgery or chemotherapy, and thus is a critical component in the
management of this disease. However, accurate delivery of RT in the lung is limited by respiratory motion, which
can result in significant displacements of the tumor (up to 2 cm). Without compensation, this motion necessitates
the irradiation of a larger volume of normal lung to account for displacement of the tumor. This larger volume of
lung irradiated increases the incidence of symptomatic radiation pneumonitis. A number of methods have been
used clinically to reduce the volume of lung irradiated including the use of breath hold and compression.
However, both are uncomfortable and difficult for patients who often have multiple comorbidities. Alternatively,
researchers are evaluating methods to track the tumor in real time and potentially adapt the treatment parameters
to the position of the lung tumor. Methods to accomplish this goal require the implantation of fiducial markers or
electromagnetic transponders. However, implantation of these devices carries a significant risk of pneumothorax,
pulmonary hemorrhage and exacerbation of underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Another
approach for tumor tracking – markerless tumor tracking (MTT) – relies on images of the tumor obtained at the
time of treatment. The most common modality for the delivery of RT is the linear accelerator equipped with an
on-board imager (OBI). X-ray-based MTT, using planar MV or kV imaging on a standard linear accelerator, is
attractive as it uses a widely available technology and can be performed in near real time. In cases where the
tumor is clearly visible, x-ray-based MTT can track tumors with a high degree of accuracy. However, a major
difficulty with MTT is that tumor-overlapping bone may not be detectable on x-ray projections.
 Our group has explored dual energy (DE) fluoroscopic imaging to increase the likelihood of successful and
accurate MTT, and have implemented DE imaging on the OBI of a commercial linear accelerator using fast-kV
switching technology. DE imaging involves obtaining x-ray images at high (i.e., 120 kVp) and low (i.e., 60 kVp)
energies. By performing a weighted-logarithmic subtraction (WLS), a third image is produced that suppresses
bone and enhances soft tissue/tumor visibility. Our hypothesis is that implementing DE imaging on a linear
accelerator will enable a practical and cost effective method for enhanced tumor visualization and image
guidance in lung RT. Moreover, DE imaging will allow for MTT ensuring a high dose is delivered to the tumor
while limiting the volume of normal tissue irradiated. To test this hypothesis and to accomplish the goals of this
research, the following specific aims are proposed: A) Identify areas for improvement in fast-kV DE imaging and
MTT with the goal toward clinical implementation and B) Development of a quality assurance program and clinical
validation."
10821446,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drains into venous blood and into meningeal lymphatic vessels. In this application,
we will test the overarching hypothesis that there exists a third CSF exit route via skull channels into the cranial
bone marrow. Three years ago, we described the existence of sub-millimeter channels connecting skull
marrow cavities with the dural vasculature in mice and humans, and that leukocytes produced in the cranial
bone marrow migrate towards the inflamed central nervous system (CNS) through these channels.
Investigating the skull channels further, we recently made the surprising observation of CNS — skull marrow
crosstalk in the opposite direction: fluorescent CSF tracers injected into the cisterna magna migrate through
skull channels in a perivascular fashion and accumulate in specific skull marrow areas distinct from regions
labeled by intravenous blood pool markers. We here propose to systematically study CSF egress through skull
channels in the steady state and in bacterial meningitis, testing the hypothesis that the skull bone marrow is a
privileged site of hematopoiesis that constantly surveys brain health via sampling the CSF for danger signals.
We will begin with a rigorous assessment of CSF skull channel outflow in healthy mice, establishing its route,
size constraints, and the marrow microenvironment receiving CSF. Motivated by our preliminary data showing
bacterial migration through skull channels into the cranial bone marrow, we will then test the relevance of CSF
skull egress in mice with bacterial meningitis induced by Streptococcus pneumoniae, clinically the most
prevalent strain. The work in mice with meningitis will reveal how skull channel CSF drainage changes in
inflammatory CNS conditions. This Co-PI application unites three different labs, creating a unique set of
complimentary expertise in neuroscience, intravital imaging, immunology and hematology. We propose to
leverage custom-developed tools such as advanced imaging of the hematopoietic niche, image-guided single
cell sequencing, non-invasive imaging for phenotyping of infection and inflammation, in combination with the
fields' gold standard assays. The program is based on bold preliminary data, will clarify the importance of
previously unknown CSF signaling to the skull marrow, and potentially advance knowledge in a setting of clear
clinical need, bacterial meningitis."
10821448,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Male fertility is reliant on the proper regulation of mRNA translation during male germ cell development. This is
achieved by the concerted actions of RNA binding proteins (RBPs). In meiotic male germ cells, RBPs are often
localized to RNA dense cytoplasmic granules termed germ cell RNA granules although many of these granules
are of unknown function. Thus, the long-term goal of this work is to define the role of RNA granules in male
germ cell differentiation and in doing so, potentially discover new modalities of post-transcriptional regulation
governing germ cell development. ADAD2 is a novel RBP of unknown molecular function that forms a unique
RNA granule. Loss of ADAD2, and by association the granule, results in severe post-meiotic germ cell loss and
complete male infertility. Using genetic models and ribosome isolation procedures, we have shown that a
subset of meiotic transcripts have increased ribosome association concurrent with reduced protein abundance
independent of total mRNA levels in Adad2 mutants. These seemingly disparate outcomes are indicative of
translation elongation defects. Supporting this notion, ADAD2 physically interacts with multiple proteins that
influence translation including a component of the eEF1B elongation complex and a regulator of the translation
repressor PIWIL1. Together, these observations lead to the hypothesis that the ADAD2 granule acts as a
hub for the proper translation of a subset of meiotic mRNAs. Using genetic models, proteomics, and
advanced RNA-sequencing analyses, this proposal will define the drivers of altered translation in Adad2
mutants and uncover the role of the ADAD2 granule in spermatogenesis. In Aim 1, how ADAD2 influences
translation elongation and the elongation complex itself will be explored. This aim will leverage multiple ‘omics
scale translation analysis methods along with quantitative mass spectrometry to define changes in elongation
and the elongation complex in Adad2 mutants. Aim 2 will delineate the interaction between ADAD2 and
PIWIL1-mediated translation regulation primarily by the application of various RNA-sequencing paradigms.
And lastly, Aim 3 will define the protein and RNA components of the ADAD2 granule by leveraging genetic
models that impinge on ADAD2 granule formation. RNA granules are incompletely described in terms of
composition and function, in spite of their importance for male fertility. This work will connect the male infertility
observed in Adad2 mutants to the molecular function of the ADAD2 granule, defining it as a fundamental
regulator of mammalian fertility and ultimately building the framework in which to define how translation
elongation is regulated in male germ cell development."

Observational and prospective studies have reported on the association between hyperglycemia
in the hospital and higher rates of hospital complications, mortality, and longer length of stay.
Insulin therapy has been demonstrated to be effective in improving glycemic control and
reducing complications among hospitalized patients. Insulin use, however, is associated with
high rates of hypoglycemia, is cumbersome to administer (up to 4 injections daily), prone to
error if not administered at appropriate times and may not inform optimal treatment for
discharge. Several randomized controlled trials have demonstrated safety and efficacy of non-
insulin therapies in the management of hyperglycemia in the hospital. No studies to date,
however, have systematically evaluated a broad range of oral antidiabetic drugs (OAD) in the
hospital setting. Accordingly, we propose a randomized controlled pragmatic clinical trial to
compare continuation of home OADs to basal bolus insulin among hospitalized patients
admitted to non-ICU services. Our goal is to determine whether OADs in patients with mild to
moderate hyperglycemia can be continued during hospitalization to achieve similar glycemic
control to basal bolus insulin without leading to increased hospital complications or higher costs.
The findings of this real-world study will directly inform clinical care in the management of
diabetes in the hospital.
In addition, this proposal will enhance the multifaceted research training and career
development plan necessary for Dr. Fayfman to become an independent clinical investigator.
Dr. Fayfman will continue to work alongside an experienced mentoring and advisory team with
expertise in clinical trials in hospital settings, biostatistics, and health economics. This training is
supported by an institutional commitment to establishing interdisciplinary research
collaborations and advancing Dr. Fayfmans’ career in academic research."
10817533,"Project Summary
Lung transplantation is a life-saving treatment for people with severe lung disease. However, complications like
primary graft dysfunction (PGD) can occur due to ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI), which limits the success of
the transplant. PGD often affects other organs, like the kidneys, and can reduce the 5-year survival rate of
patients to less than 50%. Currently, treatments that deplete neutrophils, which contribute to PGD, are not
feasible due to their role in fighting infections.
The goal of this research project is to build on seminal findings during the prior funding cycle and better
understand how donor nonclassical monocytes contribute to PGD and injury in other organs. By understanding
the mechanisms behind PGD and remote organ injury, new therapeutic strategies to improve outcomes for lung
transplant recipients can be developed.
The first aim of the project is to investigate how classical monocytes in the recipients contribute to the retention
of donor nonclassical monocytes in other organs, leading to injury. Donor nonclassical monocytes migrate to
other organs, such as the kidneys and native lung, and cause damage similar to what is observed in the lung
allograft. We will study the pathways involved in classical monocyte activation and how they promote donor
nonclassical monocyte retention. Through these experiments, we aim to identify potential therapeutic targets to
prevent bystander organ injury.
The second aim is to understand the different mechanisms of activation and contrasting roles of donor and
recipient nonclassical monocytes in the development of PGD. We have found that donor nonclassical monocytes,
but not recipient nonclassical monocytes, contribute to lung allograft damage. We investigate the factors that
activate donor nonclassical monocytes during the phases of ischemia-reperfusion and their impact on tissue
injury. Additionally, we will study the involvement of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species released from donor
lung epithelium in upregulating TLR transcription and cell surface translocation on donor nonclassical monocytes.
We will also explore our exciting new discovery that Nod2 signaling can promote the conversion of recipient
inflammatory classical monocytes into anti-inflammatory nonclassical monocytes. The goal is to develop new
therapeutic approaches to mitigate PGD and promote resolution of lung injury.
Overall, this study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the interactions between donor
nonclassical monocytes, host classical monocytes, and other immune cells in the context of PGD and bystander
organ injury. The insights gained will help develop new strategies to improve outcomes in lung transplantation
and minimize the impact of PGD on graft and recipient survival."

Language disorders afflict 6 to 8 million people in the United States. One common symptom in language
disorders is difficulty comprehending the grammatical structure of sentences. Understanding that the sentence
“The car at the stoplight is blue” refers to a blue car requires recognizing “at the stoplight” as a distinct phrase
that modifies the preceding noun phrase “the car”. People with grammatical comprehension disorders have
difficulty with this. With intracranial recordings in human neurosurgical patient volunteers with normal
language function we previously described the patterns of phrase-structure building in neural activity observed
in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and superior temporal sulcus (STS). This is hypothesized to play a causal
role in the comprehension of sentence structure, but such a role has never been demonstrated. Aim 1 will test
this hypothesis by directly electrically stimulating and thus transiently disrupting the left IFG and STS of
neurosurgical patient volunteers at key phrasal boundaries in a sentence and observing how this affects
sentence comprehension accuracy. Aim 2 will investigate a direct link between neural activity and the resulting
behavior for each trial using a self-paced reading task while we record neural activity directly from key
language network sites, specifically the left IFG and STS. We will correlate neural activity with per-word
reaction times, which reflect the processing requirements for each word. Also, for the experiments in Aim 1 we
will simultaneously record activity from one language network area (IFG or STS) while stimulating the other
area to demonstrate how disrupting each area affects activity elsewhere in the language network. Altogether,
we expect that disrupting fronto-temporal phrase-merging activity will reliably create comprehension errors,
and that this neural activity will be tied to behavioral markers of phrase processing and affected by the
intracranial stimulation in a way that we can predict given the result that the stimulation has on behavior. Our
team is uniquely qualified to accomplish these aims. This proposal will provide me with training in the
technique of intracranial stimulation with simultaneous recording in human patient volunteers performing a
task, in deepening my understanding of theoretical linguistics through formal instruction and mentoring, and in
communication disorders, specifically aphasia. In summary, the proposed studies and training plan will lead to
a better understanding of grammatical deficits in language disorders, leading to improved treatments and
interventions, and will expand my impact as a neuroscientist, serving as a bridge to independent funding."
10818338,"Electrophysiological methods, including event-related potential and functional connectivity approaches,
have strong potential to clarify mechanisms of substance use treatment response and characterize individual
differences therein. Veterans are disproportionately affected by disorders of addiction, of which cocaine use
disorder (CUD) is particularly problematic due to high relapse rates and the absence of approved pharmaco-
therapy treatment options. Behavioral interventions for CUD, have therefore become an important focus of
research and Contingency Management (CM) has emerged as the best-supported and most widely used
approach. CM involves reinforcing cocaine abstinence (established through objective testing) with reliable,
short-term reward, such as chances to win prizes (i.e., Prize-Based CM or PBCM). In response to substantial
empirical support, national dissemination of PBCM has been supported by a VHA initiative since 2011.
However, PBCM response rates are variable and long-term benefits are limited – problems magnified by the
cost of implementation with respect to staffing and prizes. Measurement-based approaches to PBCM
implementation have strong promise to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of CM programming but have
not yet been investigated within the VA or considered in relation to promising neuromarkers. Importantly, two
versions of PBCM are already utilized at VA sites and may differentially benefit individuals with distinct
neurocognitive profiles. Specifically, VA PBCM programs employ either abstract (voucher prize) or concrete
(tangible prize) incentives, the latter of which may more effectively incentivize abstinence in Veterans with
poor future-oriented thinking and planning ability. While selection between existing PBCM variants is
currently driven by practical considerations (e.g., provider convenience), measurement of pretreatment
neurocognitive functioning could meaningfully and realistically inform clinical decision-making in this regard.
 This CDA aims to advance measurement-based implementation of CM by testing a novel neurocognitive
model of CM with immediate implications for the use of abstract versus concrete PBCM incentives within the
VA. Specifically, the future-minded decision-making (FMDM) model posits that CM scaffolds future-oriented
goal representation and self-control to support abstinence during in the moment use-related decision-making.
For individuals with greater FMDM impairment, concrete, readily-accessible incentives may be more effective
than abstract monetary rewards (e.g., vouchers) which require future-oriented thinking and planning to inherit
value. To test this model, neurocognitive substrates of FMDM will be examined as predictors of differential
treatment response in voucher (VoucherPBCM) versus tangible prize (TangiblePBCM) versions of the
intervention used within the VA. Treatment-related change in neural and cognitive-behavioral correlates of
FMDM will also be evaluated in PBCM relative to treatment-as-usual (TAU) care. A total of 180 Veterans with
CUD will be allocated to VoucherPBCM (n=70), TangiblePBCM (n=70), or TAU (n=40) conditions and
followed for a 12 week treatment interval. Pre- and post-treatment electroencephalography (EEG) and
cognitive-behavioral assessments will be used to measure FMDM-related constructs (working memory, self-
control, future-oriented decision-making, future reward representation) and related neuromarkers. These
measures will subsequently be investigated as predictors of differential treatment response in VoucherPBCM
versus Tangible PBCM. Longitudinal change in FMDM-related neural substrates and cognitive abilities will also
be evaluated for evidence of neuroadaptation (e.g., changes in functional connectivity) and enhancement of
FMDM function through PBCM. The proposed research will be supported by focused training in the areas of (1)
predictive analytics, (2) functional connectivity analysis of EEG data, (3) longitudinal evaluation of
neuroadaptive mechanisms, and (4) clinical trials research. Together, research and training aims will support
development of an independent program of research targeting precision implementation of CM within the VA."
10817391,"Fragile x syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited intellectual disability and monogenic cause of
autism. FXS is caused by silencing of the FMR1 gene encoding FMRP, the fragile x messenger
ribonucleoprotein 1. FMRP is a mRNA binding protein known to regulate mRNA translation, including local
protein synthesis important for synapse development and function. Impaired surface expression of glutamate
receptors and ion channels are believed to contribute to altered synaptic plasticity and neuronal
hyperexcitability, respectively, in FXS. Recent work suggests even more global defects in membrane trafficking
and the endocytic pathway may occur at synapses in FXS. A critical gap is lack of understanding of underlying
mechanisms for how FMRP might regulate endocytosis and membrane protein surface expression to control
neuronal function. Our central hypothesis is that FMRP directly regulates endocytic machinery via local
translation and/or non-canonical mechanisms to control membrane surface protein expression. In this
application, we investigate a greatly neglected area of the Clathrin-Associated Adaptor Complex Protein-2
dependent regulatory mechanism at the translational level by FMRP. This is a new concept as AP2 regulation
studies have been traditionally focused on adaptor post-translational modification with very little work on post-
transcriptional mechanisms for any adapter protein by any RNA binding protein. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis
that FMRP is a negative regulator of the Clathrin-Associated Adaptor Complex Protein-2 (AP2) mediated
endocytosis. We propose to investigate the effects of FMRP deficiency on AP2 subunit translation, expression,
and synaptic localization in mouse cortical neurons. As AP2 is known to be required for regulation of AMPA
receptor endocytosis, we will investigate whether exaggerated internalization of AMPA receptors in FXS
neurons can be rescued by modulating aberrant expression of AP2 subunits.
Aim 2 will test the hypothesis
that loss of FMRP has broad effects on the surface expression of membrane proteins and endocytosis. We
propose to use a mass spectrometry approach for an unbiased characterization of the surface proteome in WT
versus FMR1 KO neurons. Lastly, we will investigate whether modulating aberrant expression of AP2 subunits
using genetic and pharmacologic strategies can normalize defects in the expression of surface proteins
including ion channels. The proposed studies will identify new biology for FMRP mediated control of the
dynamics of membrane protein surface expression via AP2 subunit regulation. We will broadly identify the
specific surface proteins adversely affected in FXS model neurons to guide future research. This research has
implications for future development of therapeutic strategies that may target AP2 to correct for altered
membrane protein surface expression contributing to impairments in synaptic plasticity and neuronal
hyperexcitability in FXS."
10817403,"Abstract
Plasmodium falciparum is a pathogenic eukaryote in the phylum Apicomplexa with a complex life cycle that
alternates between Anopheles mosquitoes and humans. During the blood stages of the P. falciparum life cycle,
a single merozoite invades a human red blood cell (RBC). Over the course of 48 hours, the parasite multiplies
its genetic material and organelles via schizogony to form 20-36 merozoites. During infection, a small subset of
these parasites (~0.2-1.0%) commit and differentiate into transmissible male and female gametocytes via staged
process called gametocytogenesis. These two processes require elaborate, controlled cytoskeletal remodeling
to occur. The Plasmodium cytoskeleton comprises the pellicle, which includes the parasite plasma membrane
and a specialized organelle referred to as the inner membrane complex, and the subpellicular network that
constitutes microtubules and a family of intermediate filament-like proteins called alveolins. These structures
together serve to partition cytoplasmic contents during segmentation, confer cell shape and rigidity for daughter
merozoites and developing gametocytes, and provide essential structure support during gliding motility and RBC
invasion. We have recently discovered a novel Plasmodium cytoskeletal protein, PfFIG (Found In Gametocytes)
during our study the basal complex during blood stage P. falciparum infection. My preliminary data demonstrate
that PfFIG is important for asexual replication and is associated with microtubule dynamics in segmenting
schizonts and maturing gametocytes. We do not know, however, the functional role of PfFIG during the
Plasmodium blood stages of human malaria infection. Using inducible knockout (iKO) systems together with
super-resolution and cell viability assays, I will characterize the role of PfFIG (PF3D7_1435600) in P. falciparum
daughter cell segmentation and gametocyte maturation. This will elucidate its unique role in Plasmodium
microtubule dynamics, specifically as it contributes to cell shape and facilitates life stage transitions. Additionally,
I will perform immunoprecipitation and proximity-labeling experiments to map the PfFIG interactome, identifying
proteins of interest for future study and characterization. This research will broaden our understandings of the
core cellular machinery utilized by Plasmodium to carry out its unique life cycle. Specifically, study of
Plasmodium-specific cytoskeletal proteins and their role across parasite life stages will bring us closer to
targeting these proteins with antimalarial drugs."

Treating KRAS mutant lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains a major challenge for clinical
oncology. Approximately 20% of KRAS mutant LUAD tumors carry loss-of-function mutations in
KEAP1, a negative regulator of NRF2, which is the master transcriptional regulator of the
endogenous antioxidant response. Using CRISPR/Cas9-based somatic editing in a genetically
engineered mouse model of KRAS-driven LUAD we demonstrated that loss of Keap1 hyper-
activates Nrf2 and dramatically accelerates KRAS-driven LUAD. Combining CRISPR/Cas9-
based genetic screening and metabolic analyses, we showed that Keap1 mutant cells are
dependent on increased glutamine metabolism, and this property can be therapeutically
exploited through the pharmacological inhibition. In this application we focus on characterizing
the molecular mechanisms and therapeutic potential of targeting glutamine metabolism in KRAS-
driven KEAP1 mutant LUAD, and other cancers with hyperactivation of the NRF2 antioxidant
pathway. This application aims to: 1) Assess the therapeutic potential of inhibiting glutamine
utilization in both human and murine KRAS-driven LUAD models with KEAP1 mutations, 2)
Characterize the metabolic mechanisms underlying glutamine dependency in KEAP1 mutant
LUAD, and 3) Determine the therapeutic potential of inhibiting glutaminolysis in cancers with
hyperactivation of the NRF2 pathway. Our studies will provide a rationale for sub-stratification of
patients with hyperactivation of the NRF2 pathway as treatment responders to glutaminase
inhibitors, which is pertinent to the goals of precision medicine.

10808142,"Summary
 Research suggests that early identification of individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis may be
able to improve illness course. Studies suggest that early identification of CHR using specialized interviews
with help-seeking individuals (with attenuated psychosis symptoms) is a useful approach. This work has two
major limitations: 1) interview methods have limited specificity as only 20% of CHR individuals convert to
psychosis, and 2) the expertise needed to make CHR diagnosis is only accessible in a few academic centers.
We propose to develop a new psychosis symptom domain sensitive (PSDS) battery, prioritizing tasks that
show correlations with the symptoms that define psychosis and are tied to the neurobiological systems and
computational mechanisms implicated in these symptoms. To promote accessibility, we utilize behavioral tasks
that could be administered over the internet; this will set the stage for later research testing widespread
screening that would identify those most in need of in-depth assessment. To reach that goal we first need
determine which tasks are effective for predicting illness course and how this strategy compares to published
prediction methods. We propose to recruit 500 CHR participants, 500 help-seeking individuals, and 500
healthy controls across 5 sites with the following Aims: Aim 1A) To develop a psychosis risk calculator through
the application of machine learning (ML) methods to the measures from the PSDS battery. In an exploratory
ML analysis, we will determine the added value of combining the PSDS with self-report measures and
historical predicators; Aim 1B) We will evaluate group differences on the risk calculator score and hypothesize
that the risk calculator score of the CHR group will differ from help-seeking and healthy controls. We further
hypothesize that the risk calculator score of the CHR converters will differ significantly from groups of CHR
nonconverters, help-seeking and healthy controls. The inclusion of a help-seeking group is critical for
translating the risk-calculator into clinical practice, where the goal is to differentiate those at greatest risk for
psychosis from those with other forms of psychopathology; Aim 1C): Evaluate how baseline PSDS
performance relates to symptomatic outcome 2 years later examining: 1) symptomatic worsening treated as a
continuous variable, and 2) conversion to psychosis. We hypothesize that the PSDS calculator: 1) will predict
symptom course and, 2) that the differences observed between converters and nonconverters will be larger on
the PSDS calculator than on the NAPLS calculator. Aim 2) Use ML methods, as above, to develop calculators
that predict: 2A) social, and, 2B) role function deterioration, both observed over two years. Because negative
symptoms are more strongly linked to functional outcome than positive symptoms, we predict that negative
symptom mechanism tasks will be the strongest predictor of functional decline in both domains. This project
will provide a next-generation CHR battery, tied to illness mechanisms and powered by cutting-edge
computational methods that can be used to facilitate the earliest possible detection of psychosis risk."
10808148,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Retinitis pigmentosa (RP), the most common inherited retinal degeneration, causes severe visual
disability and has no effective treatments. It is caused by mutations in one of a large number of genes
that result in rod photoreceptor degeneration while sparing cones. The loss of rods, which constitute
95% of the cells in the outer retina, results in high levels of oxygen causing oxidative stress which is a
major contributor to gradual degeneration of cone photoreceptors. Cone degeneration causes gradual
constriction of visual fields and eventual blindness. Compelling laboratory data demonstrate that
antioxidants, including N-acetylcysteine (NAC), promote cone survival and function in animal models of
RP. A clinical trial testing oral NAC in 30 RP patients showed good safety with a maximum tolerated
dose of 1800 mg bid, which resulted in good intraocular levels and caused small improvements in cone
function over a 6-month treatment period. This has led to the hypothesis that long-term administration
of NAC can promote cone survival and prevent severe visual disability in patients with RP. This project
is a large multicenter, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to test that
hypothesis. Ellipsoid zone (EZ) width measured on a spectral domain-optical coherent tomography
scan through the fovea corresponds to remaining cones with intact inner and outer segments and thus
is a biomarker for cone survival. Approximately 438 RP patients with an EZ width between 1500 and
8000 µm will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to 1800 mg NAC bid or placebo. The primary efficacy
objective is to determine if the cumulative loss of EZ width between baseline and month (M) 45 is
significantly less in eyes of subjects in the treatment group versus those in the placebo group.
Secondary efficacy objectives are to determine if reductions between baseline and M45 in mean
macular sensitivity (measured by microperimetry) or best-corrected visual acuity are decreased by NAC
treatment. A novel exploratory outcome will utilize adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscopy,
which allows non-invasive imaging of the cone mosaic with single-cell resolution, to determine if
negative changes in cone density, spacing, regularity, and reflectivity between baseline and M45 are
reduced in the intervention group versus the placebo group. All participants will have whole genome
sequencing which will allow pharmacogenomic analyses. The safety and tolerability of long-term NAC
treatment will be carefully assessed. This clinical trial has the potential to identify a new non-invasive,
oral treatment that prevents severe visual disability in patients with RP regardless of the pathogenic
mutation, thereby addressing a major unmet medical need. In addition, it will provide the most definitive
test yet as to whether oxidative damage plays a major role in cone degeneration in patients with RP
and determine if it is a validated therapeutic target for new treatment development."

The focus of this research program, which has been NIH-funded since 2012, is the influence of paternal
psychostimulant self-administration on the physiology and behavior of subsequent generations (i.e. offspring
and grand-offspring) using rat models. Our work previously demonstrated that sire cocaine self-administration
reprogramed the germline epigenome resulting in decreased cocaine reinforcing efficacy in the male progeny.
The current application expands our focus on cocaine alone to encompass the transgenerational effects of
paternal methamphetamine (meth), which will be compared and contrasted with cocaine. The proposed
research will examine the mechanisms whereby information is passed to meth-sired offspring (and potentially
grand-offspring) through epigenetic changes in sperm. We also will define epigenetic and transcriptional
profiles in the nucleus accumbens of cocaine- and meth-sired offspring that may underlie the respective
influences on psychostimulant self-administration. Specific Aim 1 will examine the behavioral consequences of
paternal meth self-administration on psychostimulant self-administration in male and female offspring (F1) and
grand-offspring (F2). Intriguingly, our preliminary results indicate that meth and cocaine produce opposite
effects on psychostimulant reinforcing efficacy in male offspring. In contrast to our prior results with cocaine,
preliminary data indicate that paternal meth self-administration results in increased self-administration of, and
motivation for, this psychostimulant selectively in male offspring. Drug naïve F1 rats will be used to generate
an F2 generation, where the acquisition, maintenance and reinforcing efficacy of meth will be assessed just as
in F1 offspring. In Specific Aim 2 we will assess epigenetic changes in sperm through which paternal
psychostimulant self-administration may influence the behavior of offspring. Potential transgenerational
cocaine- and meth-induced epigenetic alterations (small noncoding RNAs and DNA methylation) in sperm will
be evaluated. Finally, genome-wide assessments of psychostimulant transgenerational effects have not yet
been performed on neurons in the nucleus accumbens, a brain region that plays a critical role in modulating
psychostimulant-induced behaviors. The experiments in Specific Aim 3 are designed to interrogate the
landscape of accessible chromatin and gene expression by coupling single-nuclei ATAC-seq and single-nuclei
RNA-seq analyses in the accumbens of experimentally naive meth-sired, cocaine-sired and saline-sired rats.
 Collectively, the experiments described in this application will use state-of-the-art cellular, molecular and
behavioral methodologies to examine epigenetic mechanisms whereby psychostimulant-associated
information can be transmitted from sires to offspring and grand-offspring. These cross-generational studies
represent a novel strategy to identify transcripts related to risk or protective factors for psychostimulant self-
administration, which will illuminate new targets for therapeutic development."

Acetaminophen (APAP)is one of the most commonly used analgesics in the world, andoverwhelmingly

newborns in the neonatal intensive care unit. These exposures occur during critical windows of human
development where pre-clinical and clinical data demonstrating safety are lacking. Alarmingly, clinical data
support the hypothesis that the developing lung may be adversely affected by perinatal APAP exposures. The
toxicity of APAP is dependent on its conversion by the xenobiotic-metabolizing enzyme CYP2E1 the
mitochondrial toxin N-acetyl-para-benzo-quinone imine (NAPQI). Our preliminary data demonstrate that
pulmonary CYP2E1 expression peaks during the saccular stage of development and is limited to the
myofibroblast. Additionally, we show that postnatal APAP exposures induce Cyp2e1 expression in the late
saccular/early alveolar stage lung. Consistent with CYP2E1 expression, we show that the developing lung is
susceptible to APAP-induced injury. These preliminary data have led us to develop the following hypothesis:
The saccular/early alveolar stage lung is susceptible to APAP-induced injury due to developmentally-
regulated pulmonary CYP2E1 expression. We propose three specific aims to test this hypothesis. In Aim 1,
we will test the hypothesis that in utero APAP exposures during the saccular stage of lung development injure
pulmonary myofibroblasts and disrupt alveolarization. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that postnatal APAP
exposures during the late saccular/early alveolar stage induce lung CYP2E1 expression causing oxidative
stress and increase sensitivity to injury. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that inhibiting TLR9/NFκB innate
immune signaling will attenuate APAP-induced newborn lung injury. Our collaborative team bridging
developmental pulmonary biology, physiology, immunology and mitochondrial/oxidative stress biology is well
positioned to fill critical gaps in our understanding of the developmentally-regulated, cell-type specific CYP2E1
expression and APAP-induced lung injury. These studies will help determine the safety profile of APAP to
inform both maternal use and newborn exposures while identifying therapeutic targets to limit adverse effects.

and use sophisticated tools and to walk upright, and the expansion of the human cortex is the origin of our
advanced cognitive abilities. These traits are ultimately encoded in genetic changes that arose during human
evolution, and which acted to alter molecular and cellular processes during development. The goal of this
ongoing research project, which began in 2010, is to determine where in the genome those changes reside and
to understand their biological functions. Our efforts focus on two classes of gene regulatory elements that may
encode novel functions in humans. The first are Human Accelerated Regions (HARs), many of which encode
transcriptional enhancers that are highly conserved across species but show multiple human-specific sequence
changes. The second class of elements are Human Gain Enhancers (HGEs), which are transcriptional
enhancers that show increased activity in developing human tissues based on comparisons of epigenetic marks
associated with enhancer activity in human, rhesus macaque and mouse. These discoveries reveal that changes
in developmental gene regulation played a central role in the evolution of uniquely human morphology and
provide the means to experimentally model the evolution of human development. In this funding cycle, we will
use humanized mouse models to study the biological function of HACNS1, which we identified as the first
known HAR to encode human-specific regulatory activity. HACNS1 maintains its human-specific activity in
the developing mouse limb and alters the expression of the nearby transcription factor Gbx2 in the
developing embryo. We hypothesize that HACNS1 is acting within a larger network of human-specific
regulatory changes that modified development. Using the HACNS1 mouse model and our maps of
human-specific regulatory functions in the limb as entry points, we will identify transcriptional and
regulatory changes downstream of HACNS1 at single-cell resolution, model additional human-specific
regulatory functions that may interact with the regulatory changes driven by HACNS1, and determine

Never in our lifetimes has there been a greater collective focus on health or the need to address the wide
disparities we face as a country in health outcomes. The Massachusetts Institute for Equity-Focused
Learning Health System Science (MIELHSS) brings together an alliance of FQHCs, Safety Net Hospitals,
Community Clinics, Patients, PCORnet sites, and leading academic health systems who share a common
purpose to accelerate research and train the future workforce to advance learning health system science,
address disparities, and improve health outcomes for the U.S. The overarching objective of MIELHSS is to
develop scientists in embedded research, and accelerate innovation in human-centered, equity-focused learning
health system (E-LHS) science. Our framework for training and learning is based on the quintuple aim of
healthcare: better health, improved patient experiences, care team wellbeing, and health equity, at lower cost.
We will develop future research leaders who can lead progress toward that goal. Our proposed curriculum,
experiential activities, mentorship, partnerships, data, and programming provide the core competencies required
to generate these innovative leaders in E-LHS science. Our specific aims are to: 1) Advance the development
of a diverse workforce of embedded E-LHS scientists across the professional development lifecycle; 2)
Accelerate enduring advancement in E- LHS science by adopting common data standards across a broad and
diverse network of equity measures and social determinants of health; and 3) Forge a strong cross institutional
alliance between community, safety net, academic health systems, patients, mentors, and scholars to drive
widespread and enduring change. Our team has strong working relationships and deep and complementary
experience across LHS Core Competencies and PCORI research, mentoring and training scholars including
LHS scholars, and a shared commitment to addressing health equity for all. We will provide tailored training
experiences across the professional lifecycle, community-wide engagement activities, data integration, methods
development, and proactive dissemination to accelerate the spread of successful E-LHS research. We will
measure success using traditional academic measures such as grant submissions and publications but also by
measuring health system engagement in MIELHSS activities and sustained implementation and widespread
adoption of interventions identified through this work."

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is now the most common liver disease worldwide and affects nearly
40% of obese youth and up to 10% of the general pediatric population. Some features of NAFLD are similar in
children and adults, yet fibrosis and inflammation are more common in the portal zone and occur earlier in
pediatric NAFLD patients than adults. This portends a rapid progression to end-stage liver disease in early
adulthood. For the majority of children with NAFLD, mechanisms driving the origin and rapid progression of
disease remain unknown. Thus, there is a critical, unmet need to study the specific underlying patterns of
metabolic and molecular changes in the liver underlying development and progression unique to children with
NAFLD. Hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL) is a primary driver of hepatic steatosis in adults with NAFLD and
is accelerated by insulin resistance. Additionally, flux through the TCA cycle toward gluconeogenesis (GNG) is
increased, which promotes mitochondrial damage, liver injury, and progression to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis
(NASH) through oxidative stress. Whether and how elevated rates of DNL and GNG advance pediatric NAFLD
is unknown. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are critical regulators of DNL and GNG in animal models and emerging as
potential biomarkers in adults with NAFLD but are understudied in pediatric NAFLD. Our preliminary data
show that serum miR-122 and miR-192 are increased in adolescent NAFLD patients compared to controls.
However, a complete profile of circulating miRNAs in pediatric NAFLD is now possible to develop a non-
invasive biomarker panel for children. We will combine novel tracer, RNA, and tissue imaging methods to
discriminate the metabolic and molecular changes among clinically-significant stages of pediatric NAFLD. We
hypothesize that increased rates of DNL and GNG are causative pathways for progression from NAFLD in
children, that miR-122 and miR-192 drive the development of steatosis to NASH, and that spatial heterogeneity
in portal zone gene expression, fibrosis, and oxidative activity are responsible for the unique histopathology in
children. In aim 1, an oral tracer approach is used to measure DNL and GNG in adolescents with NAFLD and
in healthy peers who are classified as either obese or normal weight. In aim 2, miRNA analyses in serum and
liver will determine their role as biomarkers for NAFLD and mediators of the disease. In aim 3, we will perform
high resolution molecular imaging of liver biopsies to determine the abundance and distribution of fibrosis,
energetics, and transcripts. This study will establish for the first time whether GNG and DNL drive the
pathogenesis of pediatric NAFLD, whether miRNAs are circulating biomarkers for diagnosis of NAFLD, and
whether the periportal distribution of liver gene expression, oxidative metabolism, and collagen formation
unique to pediatric NAFLD patients are associated with worse metabolic assessments. Collectively, by taking
advantage of unique tools, we will identify the sub-cellular etiology, early mechanisms, and potentially
modifiable pathways and biomarkers unique to children with NAFLD."

 This proposal is a competing renewal application of the Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse
Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN), which joined the CTN in 2015. The Northeast Node brought
hundreds of community and healthcare partners across the states of New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine to
the CTN community for the first time. These states have among the very highest rates of substance use in the
U.S., including opioid use, and they include some of the most rural communities in the U.S. The Node has
brought significant expertise to the CTN in conducting practical, rigorous, innovative, and highly impactful trials
focused on improving the treatment of substance use disorders (SUDs) in community systems in the Northeast
and in partnership with other CTN Nodes across the nation. Node Investigators have extensive experience in
leading national and multi-national clinical trials, digital technology; medication and behavioral treatments for
opioid use disorder; co-occurring SUDs and mental health disorders; SUD and chronic pain; SUD in pregnant
women; opioid, cannabis, tobacco, alcohol, stimulant, and polydrug treatment; SUD prevention and treatment
among youth; and implementation science. The Northeast Node is embedded within the Center for Technology
and Behavioral Health (CTBH), a NIDA-funded P30 “Center of Excellence”. The Node thus brings significant
expertise in developing, evaluating, and implementing digital treatments for SUDs, with a focus on overcoming
the striking disparities in treatment access and treatment quality evident in healthcare across the globe.
 In the renewal period, the Node proposes to enhance its activities and contributions to the national CTN
to embrace advances in scientific discovery and research innovations that offer great promise for increasing
the reach and effectiveness of treatments for SUDs. The Node will engage a broader group of investigators
that bring additional expertise in data science (bioinformatics, predictive modeling, artificial intelligence, social
media, data privacy/security) and experimental design (micro-randomized trials, adaptive designs, and
implementation/systems science). With this expanded group of partners, it will support and grow a productive
research agenda in the CTN with a focus on (a) digital health and data analytics, including research focused on
providing personalized, science-based resources to individuals with SUD via digital technology and (b)
expanding low threshold access to science-based SUD care, particularly in rural contexts (e.g., general
medical settings; pharmacies; and community organizations). And the Node will lead an expansion of CTN
research on the (c) rapidly evolving landscape of cannabis use as well as (d) co-morbid SUD and mental
health disorders. The Node will establish Community and Policy Advisory Boards to complement the existing
communication infrastructure between Node investigators and their partners, with a focus on identifying the
most significant and timely SUD needs in our communities and scaling-up and sustaining best practices."

Many emerging zoonotic viruses (animal viruses that transmit to humans) are highly pathogenic, having the
potential to cause deadly epidemics or even global pandemics. The risks zoonotic viruses pose are highlighted
by the emergence of the SARS/MERS coronaviruses, Ebola virus, and HIV-1, all of which are related to animal
viruses that were unknown before they caused substantial cases of disease in humans. Given the risk animal
viruses pose to humans, many researchers have turned to viral discovery—using genome sequencing tools and
metagenomic analyses, researchers hope to identify novel animal viruses before they emerge in humans. While
such efforts will prove invaluable to our understanding animal virus ecology, I seek to expand this work by
experimentally evaluating the zoonotic risk an animal virus poses. The crux of this proposal is as follows.
Experimental assessment of animal virus replication in human cells is crucial to evaluate zoonotic risk. However,
an animal virus facing one block to replication in a human cell will have the same phenotype as an animal virus
facing twenty blocks: producing low or no titers on human cells. But there is a critical difference between these
two scenarios—an animal virus facing one block poses a greater zoonotic risk because it requires fewer adaptive
mutations to replicate in human cells. Here, I propose to develop and demonstrate an experimental pipeline that
will distinguish between animal viruses facing few blocks to replication in human cells from those with many.
 Host genetics plays a critical role in the species specificity of viruses. Divergence in host proteins used
for virus entry (cellular receptors), replication (cellular cofactors), and antiviral immunity (restriction factors) can
serve as potent barriers to virus infection in a new host species. Using hypothesis-driven studies and high-
throughput genomic approaches, I will systematically characterize this host-virus interaction landscape for an
understudied family of primate viruses (simarteriviruses). In Aim 1, I will assess the compatibility of diverse
simarteriviruses with the human version of their cellular receptor, CD163. In Aim 2, I will employ a CRISPR
screen to identify host cofactors required for simarterivirus replication. Then, I will use evolutionary signatures of
positive natural selection to identify those host proteins likely to engage simarteriviruses in a species-specific
manner. In Aim 3, I will identify antiviral proteins that block simarterivirus replication. Using a series of gene
knockdowns and complementations, I will evaluate the genetic barriers to simarterivirus replication in human
cells (Aims 1-3). Taken together, these aims will establish an experimental framework to evaluate the zoonotic
risk of an understudied animal virus, and will provide me with new training in 1) performing and writing about
molecular evolution analyses, 2) developing high-throughput sequencing projects and data analysis, and 3)
functional genomics, defined as the execution and analysis of genome-scale screens for phenotypes of interest."

Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture is a common knee injury in sports that is usually surgically treated with
ACL reconstruction. Most patients expect to resume pre-injury sport participation after ACL reconstruction, yet
only 65% do, and up to 20% of those sustain another ACL injury. Fear of re-injury contributes to the sub-
optimal return-to-sport outcomes, giving it clinical importance and raising awareness of it. Yet a range of
negative (e.g., anger, fear/kinesiophobia) and positive (e.g., motivation, self-efficacy/confidence) psychological
responses are typical after ACL reconstruction. It is important to effectively manage psychological responses
because they impact behaviors, and in turn, outcomes. Standard ACL reconstruction rehabilitation strictly
focuses on exercise for knee impairments, and clinicians do not feel prepared to help patients manage their
psychological responses. Also, patients lack an understanding of psychological responses and helpful mental
skills. Clinicians and patients both require training to address the unmet need for psychological support in ACL
reconstruction rehabilitation. The objective of this study is to examine the efficacy of Rehabilitation with
Exercise and Psychological Support (REPS), a rehabilitation approach that integrates exercise with
psychological support provided by a clinician and patient training videos. The central hypothesis is that REPS
will facilitate better psychological response (Specific Aim 1) and knee function (Specific Aim 2) than Standard
Rehabilitation after ACL reconstruction. The feasibility, acceptability, and fidelity of implementing REPS will be
explored. This is a pilot randomized controlled trial of 60 patients with ACL reconstruction who receive REPS
or Standard Rehabilitation. Both groups will perform exercise per a standard rehabilitation protocol. REPS
clinicians (n=4) will receive didactic training and mentorship from the study team on a psychologically informed
practice approach for assessment and treatment, including patient-centered communication and cognitive-
behavioral techniques. Patients in REPS will receive training on mental skills to improve the psychological
response in videos created by the study team. Baseline testing will be immediately before the first rehabilitation
visit, and primary follow-up testing will be 6 months post-surgery, when rehabilitation typically completes. This
study will generate knowledge about a rehabilitation approach intended to provide psychological support to
patients during ACL reconstruction rehabilitation. The study has good potential to be impactful because it
targets an unmet need in ACL reconstruction rehabilitation that contributes to clinical outcomes. The REPS
intervention is innovative because it is administered within a clinical setting, engages both patients and
clinicians with pragmatic training methods, and could enhance patient-clinician communication to strengthen
therapeutic alliance for better rehabilitation adherence and outcomes."

How skilled behaviors like speech and language are actively maintained throughout life is not well understood
and still poorly studied. Our research program uses songbird vocal learning and vocal production to understand
how forebrain circuits and reinforcement mechanisms are used to acquire and then maintain learned
vocalizations. Our research has helped demonstrate that midbrain dopaminergic circuits bidirectionally guide
learned changes in song in a manner consistent with them functioning as reward prediction error signals
envisaged by reinforcement models. Building from this, we turn our attention to understand how the basal ganglia
and dopaminergic circuits support the lifelong maintenance of behavior. We hypothesize that predictive
dopaminergic signals safeguard the lifelong maintenance of natural behaviors. Our initial studies provide a
glimpse at central mechanisms sufficient to initiate the long term decrystallization of a previously learned and
internally reinforced natural behavior. Using a variety of cutting-edge approaches that we have optimized for
circuit interrogation in songbirds, we aim to dissect the cellular and synaptic mechanisms associated with song
decrystallization, and the role of circuit nodes downstream of dopaminergic pathways in song maintenance and
song decrystallization. In the first aim we will test the role of predictive dopaminergic signals in the long-term
maintenance of adult zebra finch song using optogenetic manipulations and functional imaging of dopamine
activity in adult animals. In the second aim we will examine the cellular and synaptic mechanisms of song
decrystallization. In the third aim we will test the role of pallidal-thalamic circuits downstream of dopaminergic
striatal pathways in the implementation and rescue of song decrystallization. Together, these studies can provide
fundamental and mechanistic insights into how the brain continuously monitors and updates behavior to maintain
expert performance and reveal what happens when this process goes awry."

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of disability in the industrialized world but there are no approved disease
modifying drugs for OA. The long-term objective of my laboratory is to understand the factors that mediate the
development and maintenance of articular cartilage so that specific targets to prevent or treat OA can be
identified. TGF-ß is a multifunctional peptide that has been shown to regulate skeletal development and
tissue-specific gene expression. We were the first to identify TGF-ß as a chondroprotective factor. The
importance of TGF-ß in human osteoarthritis has now been well established. We previously identified several
down-stream targets of TGF-ß that regulate post-translational processing of the major extracellular matrix
proteins in cartilage. One in particular, 3-Prime-Phoshoadenosine 5-Prime-Phosphosulfate Synthase 2
(Papss2), has been associated with osteoarthritis in humans and mice and is required for proper sulfation of
glycosamino glycans in cartilage. The transcription factor Sox9 has similar roles in cartilage as TGF-ß and in
the last funding period we showed that TGF-ß regulates post-translational modifications on Sox9 and
increases the half-life of the Sox9 protein. Furthermore, we showed that Sox9 is sufficient and required for
TGF-ß-mediated regulation of Papss2 transcription defining a novel signaling pathway for TGF-ß in cartilage.
We also showed, using a bioreactor model, that expression of Sox9 in cartilage deficient for TGF-ß signaling
was sufficient to restore proteoglycan staining to that cartilage. In this funding period, we propose to continue
to determine the mechanisms by which TGF-ß post-translationally modifies the Sox9 protein and determine the
biological consequences of the modifications. We will also determine the molecular mechanism whereby TGF-
ß regulates Papss2 expression through a novel Sox9-dependent mechanism. Detailed molecular information
about the mechanisms of TGF-ß action in articular cartilage will allow us to develop high throughput assays for
future drug discovery screens. We propose the following specific aims: 1A) To determine how TGF-ß regulates
the phosphorylation of Sox9 on Serine 181; 1B) Determine the role of Serine 211 in TGF-ß-mediated
stabilization of Sox9 protein; 1C) Determine the mechanism whereby TGF-ß treatment results in sumoylation
of Sox9; 2) Determine the biological functions of post translationally modified Sox9 3) Identify TGF-ß /Sox9
responsive DNA elements in the Papss2 gene; and 4) Determine if downstream targets of TGF-ß can prevent
cartilage degeneration and OA. The information acquired during this project period will provide cartilage unique
targets for drug discovery to prevent or treat osteoarthritis."
10804648,"Aging and the chronic diseases associated with aging, such as obesity and neurodegeneration, combined with
military service (trauma, burn pit exposure etc.) make old age Veterans more vulnerable to community-acquired
viral pathogens. This reduces quality of life for Veterans and places a tremendous burden on our healthcare
system. As the Veteran population ages, the burden will only increase. Hence, there is a great need to discover
fundamental mechanisms of aging to develop rational strategies for minimizing the vulnerability of aged Veterans
to viral and bacterial pathogens. The Geroscience hypothesis posits that therapeutically targeting fundamental
mechanisms of aging would yield a larger dividend in terms of improving the health of the aged population, than
would treating individual age-related diseases, and would confer resistance against stressors such as viral
infections. During aging, senescent cells accumulate and can prove toxic to many organismal functions.
Elimination of senescent cells using senolytic drugs have already fostered clinical trials, and in mice, senolytics
improve physical function, tissue health and suppress all-cause mortality. The current pandemic has identified
those who are particularly vulnerable to adverse outcomes when exposed to a new pathogen, and community
acquired viral infection has emerged as an urgent threat to our aged population, including Veterans. Little is
known about the effects of community-acquired infections in vulnerable populations, including those with obesity
and neurodegeneration.
The goal of the present project is to determine if fisetin (a senolytic compound derived from fruits and vegetables)
and other senolytics such as dasatinib and quercetin, can reduce morbidity and mortality in mice with obesity
and mice with neurodegeneration, that are exposed to normal microbial experience (NME), as a model of
community acquired viral infection. We will also use the knowledge and resources we have to study the role of
cellular senescence in driving adverse outcomes in aged, obese and Parkinson's mouse models acutely exposed
to NME. Preliminary data indicate that mice with a substantial senescent cell burden respond much worse to
inflammatory challenges than mice without senescent cells. Furthermore, exposure to normal pathogens carried
by wild or pet store mice is sufficient to kill old experimental mice housed in specified pathogen-free conditions,
but it does not kill young mice. Here, we propose to use this experimental paradigm to determine if senolytics,
drugs that specifically kill senescent cells, suppress mortality in NME exposed aged obese mice, and in a mouse
model of Parkinson's disease. The immediate goal is to generate sufficient preclinical data to support clinical
trials using nutraceuticals with senolytic activity to prevent adverse outcomes in Veterans at high risk of infection
or grave illness after infection."
10804649,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Complications associated with vascular access for hemodialysis represent one of the most important sources of
morbidity among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the United States today. Among the various
types of vascular access, arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is preferred because it has better patency rates and fewer
complications than other access types. However, AVF primary failure impeding AVF maturation remains a
common problem and adding to patients’ morbidity and mortality. Neointimal hyperplasia (NIH) has been
identified as one of the main pathophysiologic culprits underlying AVF failure. Thus, improving AVF maturation,
reducing NIH, and optimizing imaging for accurate diagnosis and localization of NIH lesions are critical, as well
as understanding the mechanism of failure, so that therapeutic interventions can be executed.
Based on our preliminary data, we propose to develop novel, resorbable polymeric scaffolds with varying
physico-chemical properties that can be wrapped around the AVF to offer structural support and that can be
loaded with multifunctional, photoacoustic (PA)- and computed tomography (CT)-active nanoparticles (to
facilitate imaging) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) (to mitigate inflammation and NIH). We will then test
their safety and efficacy in vitro and in vivo using a uremic rat and pig animal models. In addition, we will assess
the use of ultrasound (US) and PA imaging, in combination with positron emission tomography (PET) imaging
techniques for monitoring inflammation and AVF maturation. We hypothesize that this therapeutic strategy once
delivered locally and in a sustained manner, will increase the concentration in the AVF without systemic toxicity,
as well as provide structural support to enhance outward remodeling. We will test this hypothesis in three specific
aims: 1) develop a biodegradable polymeric scaffold containing nanoparticles and MSCs to mitigate inflammation
and subsequent pathologic NIH during AVF maturation, 2) assess various imaging techniques for monitoring
AVF maturation and integrity, and 3) assess physiologic, radiologic, and pathologic changes following
implantation of the engineered polymer in the peri-adventitial tissue surrounding iatrogenic AVFs in rat and pig
models.
The proposed work is significant and innovative because the step-by-step optimization of the physico-chemical
properties of the polymeric scaffold will improve the structure of the AVF, as well as delivery and retention of
MSCs, which would yield improved rates of AVF maturation and patency among ESRD patients on hemodialysis.
The successful completion of the proposed work will help us understand the mechanism of the pathogenesis of
non-maturing AVFs and whether polymeric scaffolds loaded with MSCs can modulate NIH. Furthermore, the
development of combined US/PA and PET/CT imaging will elucidate the role of not only inflammation but also
other targets in AVF maturation/non-maturation for potential drug and/or device development."
10800950,"Abstract
Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is an enormous public health problem. While there have been gains in our knowledge
of this disorder, we lack fundamental knowledge pertaining to the biological mechanisms that drive aberrant
behavior associated with AUD. Ethanol exposure modifies signaling across brain regions, and these changes
are thought to underlie persistent alterations in behavior. The serotonin (5HT) system has been implicated in the
pathophysiology of AUD and represents a potential avenue for therapeutic intervention. In the previous funding
period, we examined how ethanol exposure could divergently impact anatomically defined dorsal raphe 5HT
systems, focusing on cortical and subcortical 5HT signaling. We found that alcohol drinking leads to a
suppression of 5HT function in the orbitofrontal cortex, and that disrupting 5HT function there led to increased
alcohol consumption. We found that sub-cortical 5HT signaling was engaged, in the BNST and the lateral
habenula, and led to disrupted social behavior and heightened arousal response via 5HT2C-R activation.
Previous studies from the lab had found that 5HT2C-R activation was coupled to CRF function. Because of this,
as well as previous work from the lab showing BNST CRF neurons are involved in alcohol consumption, we
examined the role of BNST CRF in alcohol drinking. Specifically, we found that genetic deletion of CRF from
the BNST led to a robust decrease in alcohol self-administration. BNST CRF neurons project to the dorsal raphe,
and CRF signaling in the DR can both regulate alcohol consumption and inhibit 5HT release in the cortex. These
data serve as the basis for our model in which alcohol withdrawal leads to engagement of CRF neurons in the
BNST that project to the DR to drive long lasting suppression of activity in cortically-projecting 5HT neurons,
driving escalated and aversion resistant alcohol consumption."

Over 80% of adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) struggle to achieve good glycemic control, placing them at
risk for acute and chronic complications. Instilling good T1D management practices in adolescence can set a
pattern into adulthood, improving long-term health while reducing future burden on patient and family quality of
life, adolescent psychosocial development, and the health care system. Health psychology and economics
research suggest that financial incentives can increase adolescent adherence to T1D self-management
regimens. We developed InvesT1D, a flexible, patient centered incentives intervention based on rigorous
developmental research that included qualitative, ethical, and stated preference analyses. A pilot randomized
controlled trial (RCT) demonstrated that InvesT1D was effective at improving adherence to self-management
goals and time-in-range among continuous glucose monitor users. We propose a larger, more comprehensive
study to determine the most efficacious financial incentive structure and to evaluate InvesT1D’s impact on
time-in-range, HbA1c, adverse events, long-term health, diabetes distress, family conflict, health care
utilization, and adolescent and caregiver quality of life. In this hybrid effectiveness-implementation study, we
will use mixed methods to evaluate InvesT1D’s efficacy, long-term health benefits, cost-effectiveness, and
implementation feasibility. Our interdisciplinary team’s innovative approach includes an RCT, trial- and model-
based economic evaluations (from the payer, health care, and societal perspectives), a policy analysis, the
development of a decision support dashboard, and qualitative interviews with patient, health care payer, and
health care delivery system stakeholders. Methodologic contributions of the InvesT1D study can make a
significant contribution to the scientific approach for developing incentive interventions for a range of behavioral
health-related conditions."
10801132,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Klebsiella pneumoniae has emerged as a critical human pathogen in the United States and globally. In
the United States, K. pneumoniae is the third most common cause of hospital-acquired infections and accounts
for 20% of deaths attributable to antibiotic-resistant bacteria. In low- and middle-income countries, K.
pneumoniae is a leading cause of childhood mortality and neonatal sepsis. Despite the rising importance of
this pathogen, there are no U.S. Food and Drug Administration or World Health Organization-approved
vaccines for K. pneumoniae.
 Our project is designed to address three critical knowledge gaps related to the development of Klebsiella
vaccines. First, although a quadrivalent O-antigen vaccine for K. pneumoniae has been proposed, there is
insufficient evidence to show that the inclusion of only four O-types would provide sufficient protection against
the nine structural subtypes of these K. pneumoniae O-antigens. To address this knowledge gap, we will
determine whether human infection with each K. pneumoniae O-antigen subtype results in cross-specific
antibody responses against other K. pneumoniae subtypes. This research will provide new and detailed
information on the specificity of human O-antigen responses to K. pneumoniae and inform the antigenic
composition of a K. pneumoniae O-antigen vaccine. Second, our proposed experiments will determine which
K. pneumoniae antigens contribute to functional human antibody responses the bacterium. Specifically, we will
determine whether antibody responses to both the capsular (K-) and O-antigens the bacteria through
interactions with phagocytic cells and complement. This is important because such functional responses are
likely to mediate protection against K. pneumoniae infection. Third, we will determine which types of
antibodies are associated with protection against intestinal colonization with K. pneumoniae. If we identify
antibodies that are correlated with protection against K. pneumoniae, this will represent a groundbreaking
finding and aid in the development of vaccines for this important pathogen.
 In summary, we expect the proposed studies to generate fundamental insights into immunity against this
pathogen and aid in the development and assessment of K. pneumoniae vaccines. Our proposed work will
provide critical data to inform the antigenic composition of K. pneumoniae vaccines and new proxy measures
to assess vaccine efficacy in pre-clinical and early phase vaccine trials. These insights are urgently needed to
address the growing global threat of antibiotic-resistant K. pneumoniae."
10801133,"Abstract: Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) are powerful vasodilators,
which are secreted by heart muscle cells. BNP and N-terminal proBNP (NT-proBNP) are widely used as
diagnostic biomarkers for heart failure (HF) and cardiac dysfunction in clinical medicine.
Plasma
concentrations of BNP and NT-proBNP correlate with disease severity, development of symptoms, and
prognosis in heart failure and coronary heart disease. High plasma concentrations of BNP and NT-
proBNP are strong predictors for risk of myocardial infarction and adverse outcomes in patients
presenting with acute coronary syndromes. However, whether BNP contributes to the pathogenesis of
the cardiovascular disease remains elusive. Preliminary studies indicate that injection of BNP into mice
promoted thrombus formation in a FeCl3-induced arterial thrombosis model. BNP also potentiated
platelet aggregation in mice and humans. These data suggest that BNP is not only a diagnostic
biomarker
of the heart failure and coronary heart disease, it may also contribute to the pathogenesis and progression
of the cardiovascular disease, especially to the thrombotic event. ANP and BNP are circulating hormones
of cardiac origin that play an important role in the regulation of intravascular blood volume and vascular
tone through their receptor natriuretic receptor-A (NPRA). NPRA is a membrane-bound guanylyl cyclase
that generates cGMP, an important second messenger. In the preliminary studies, it was found for the
first time that NPRA is present in platelets, and incubation of platelets with BNP increased intracellular
cGMP concentrations. Based on these findings, the central hypothesis to be tested is that BNP is not
only a biomarker of the cardiovascular disease, but also promotes thrombosis through platelet activation,
and thereby influences adverse cardiovascular events. This hypothesis will be tested in the following
specific aims: Aim 1 is to establish BNP as an important mediator of thrombosis, and elucidate the
mechanism of BNP-induced platelet activation. The working hypothesis is that BNP potentiate platelet
activation and thrombosis via its receptor NPRA. Intracellular signaling by natriuretic peptides is typically
mediated by PKG II. NPRA deficient and PKG II deficient mice will be used to test the hypothesis that
NPRA/cGMP/PKG II mediates the effect of BNP on platelet activation and thrombosis in vivo. Aim 2 is to
investigate the role of NPRA/cGMP in platelet activation and thrombosis. The preliminary data indicate
that agonist-induced platelet aggregation, in the absence of exogenous ANP or BNP, was impaired in
the NPRA-/- mice. This aim is to investigate whether NPRA contributes to thrombosis under physiological
conditions without injection of BNP. Completion of these studies will provide evidence that BNP may not
only serve as important biomarkers of cardiovascular disease, but also mediate adverse events by effects
on platelet function. A novel mechanism of platelet activation and thrombosis will also be identified."
10802853,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
The nuclear envelope encloses the nucleus and establishes a critical protective barrier around genomic DNA.
Proteins embedded in and associated with the two membrane bilayers of the nuclear envelope play crucial roles
in mediating chromatin organization, nuclear positioning, and connections to the cytoskeletal network. There is
growing appreciation that disruption of nuclear envelope integrity is linked to multiple aging-associated diseases
and contributes to genomic instability in cancer. Upon each cell division in mammalian cells, the nucleus is
dismantled and reformed. Scrutiny of nuclear envelope assembly has revealed the remarkable feature that two
distinct domains are present at the nascent nuclear envelope. Core regions at the center of each face of the
anaphase chromatin disk are a site of microtubule remodeling, and non-core regions at the disk periphery are a
site of rapid nuclear pore formation. This specialization facilitates quick, coordinated enclosure of chromatin.
Progression to interphase nuclear architecture involves elimination of the distinction between these regions and
further expansion of membrane. Completion of nuclear assembly, however, does not mean that the nuclear
envelope is static. Indeed, emerging evidence supports the notion that continuous adaptations must take place
at the nuclear envelope to maintain nuclear envelope structure and, in some cases, to sculpt new architectural
features. Using approaches ranging from timelapse microscopy to proximity labeling, this proposal seeks to
address fundamental questions about how the nuclear envelope is formed and how its organization and topology
are maintained. Toward this end, the first aim is to determine molecular pathways that underlie dynamic
organization of the nascent nuclear envelope. This aim will focus on testing roles of the inner nuclear membrane
protein LEM2, defining motifs that direct core/non-core regional targeting, and investigating how dissolution of
the core region is accomplished. Added insight will be gained by examining how the nuclear envelope forms at
micronuclei, which arise from mis-segregated chromosomes; in particular, we will investigate how a fragile
nuclear envelope forms in a subpopulation of micronuclei. The second aim is to elucidate the role of LEM2 in
dynamic events at the interphase nuclear envelope and learn how these are altered in disease-associated alleles
of LEM2. This aim takes advantage of a system in which nuclear membrane deformation can be induced to test
mechanisms that contribute to the resilience of nuclear envelope architecture. Results reported in the literature,
as well as our observations, implicate LEM2 in responding to these perturbations. These complementary aims
will yield a deeper understanding of nuclear envelope formation and reveal pathways that play critical roles in
nuclear architecture, as well as probe how they go awry at micronuclei and are disrupted in human disease."
10807897,"Older Veterans are an important and understudied population for suicide prevention. Adults 65 years and older
will be 20% of the US population and 50% of the Veteran population by 2030. It has been documented that the
majority of decedents who die by suicide in the Veteran population are Veterans 50 years and older (≥ 69%)
and over 40% Veterans 65 years and older. Moreover, older adults, including Veterans, have high rates of
premeditated lethal means of suicide method indicating less impulsivity and more opportunity to intervene;
thus, studying older Veterans is a high priority for supporting suicide prevention. In the current proposal, our
objective is to understand the combination of factors that lead to suicide death for aging Veterans by identifying
the short- and long-term typologies that best characterize suicide death among older Veterans and by
examining pathways from suicide attempt to mortality. Thus far, our research suggests that there are distinct
acute medical and psychiatric profiles and potential trajectories that may influence an older individual’s long-
term risk of suicide and employment of lethal means, which further influences policies and strategies for
mitigation and prevention. To capture these profiles and trajectories, we will use latent clustering techniques to
uniquely characterize (separately by social and clinical characteristics) those who attempt and die by suicide.
The current proposed research builds on a productive, ongoing body of suicide research in older Veterans. Our
work has informed prognostic factors (e.g., psychoactive medication use), timing and burden of diagnosis (i.e.,
recent diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment or dementia), and life transitions (i.e., reentry into community
from incarceration) associated with increased risk of suicide attempt. Yet, major gaps remain in our
understanding of how best to characterize risk for lethality of suicide attempt. Short- and long-term precursors
delineated by profiles and trajectories of social risk factors (e.g., housing instability, financial strain,
interpersonal violence) may inform suicide risk and lethal means of suicide death (e.g., firearms, drug
overdose). We propose in this current application to build on the nationally representative cohort for late-life
suicide research formed in the PI’s existing CSR&D Merit Award project (the “Older Veteran Suicide Risk
Dataset”, CX001119; PI: Byers) with new questions to determine profiles, trajectories, care transitions, and
social and clinical factors contributing to risk of suicide attempt and death by suicide in aging Veterans. This
unique cohort comprises all Veterans (~5,000,000) who used VA health care services and were aged 50 years
and older in fiscal year 2012-2013, prospectively followed to present with data updated annually. The cohort
includes information on demographics, all psychiatric and medical diagnoses, prescription medication use,
laboratory measures, and information on all suicide-related outcomes, including date and method of suicide
death. In the current longitudinal cohort (2012-2019), we have documented >40,000 suicide attempts, including
>13,000 suicide deaths. The Veterans Health Administration is also uniquely positioned to study social factors
using electronic health data given rare and relevant extant data sources [e.g., VA Health Factors, USVETS,
Geocode data, and VA’s National Homeless Programs (HOMES) data]. The current proposal will identify
distinct social and clinical typologies that characterize short-term (Aim 1a) and long-term (Aim 1b) course
leading to suicide attempt and death by suicide in older Veterans. Furthermore, this study will evaluate extent
to which social and clinical risk factor profiles (developed in Aim 1) are associated with increased likelihood of
suicide death, including lethal means (Aim 2), and evaluate the influence of acute and emergent care
transitions on the pathway to suicide death (Aim 3). We will investigate differences in typologies for high risk
but underrepresented groups (e.g., women Veterans; sexual, gender and racial/ethnic minorities). The findings
of the proposed project will deepen our understanding of the course of suicide attempts and death by suicide in
aging Veterans, and guide patient-centered decisions within suicide prevention, including lethal means safety."
10807453,"Arthritis is a major health concern to the Veteran population who have 35% incidence rates. Ankylosing
spondylitis (AS), a type of inflammatory arthritis that results in chronic back pain, sacroiliac joint and/or
vertebral joint fusion and permanent spinal deformity. Although the cause of AS is not known, genetic studies
suggest that CD4+ T helper cells that produce the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-17 (Th17 cells) drive the
pathogenesis of AS. In support, pharmacological inhibition of IL-17 (IL-17i) has had great utility in moderating
AS symptoms. Although Th17 responses appear to be key in driving symptomatic disease, less is understood
of the underlying innate cellular mechanisms that initiate pathologic Th17 cell responses. Given our limited
understanding of immunopathogenesis of AS physicians are challenged with administering one of several
approved anti-rheumatic biologics (i.e. IL-17i, TNFi, JAKi) to patients without mechanistic insight into who will
respond best to each drug. Thus, development of treatment response biomarkers is urgently needed to
increase therapeutic responses and alleviate pain in patients suffering from this debilitating disease. To move
this field forward we are in urgent need of more research to reveal genetic and molecular mediators of IL-17-
mediated AS. An emerging paradigm suggests that self-reactive T cells (autoimmune) and aberrant innate
immunity (autoinflammation) conspire to drive AS pathogenesis. In support, a mutation in the microbial-
signaling molecule CARD9 (i.e. rs4077515) is associated with increased susceptibility to AS. The CARD9-
signaling axis is essential for fungal immunity, yet how dysregulation of CARD9 might regulate sterile
inflammation in AS has not been studied. This application is based on our finding that CARD9 is a genetic
determinant of AS in genetically susceptible SKG mice. CARD9 appears to be functioning within neutrophils to
induce arthritogenic Th17 responses. Given our data we hypothesize that CARD9 is an important regulator of
arthritogenic Th17 cells in AS. The goal of this Merit proposal is to determine the mechanism by which innate
cellular processes induce arthritogenic Th17 cells in AS and use this information to develop a biomarker of IL-
17i treatment responders in the clinic. Importantly, clinical studies proposed in this application will be focused
on AS patients previously enrolled in or newly enrolled in from the Veteran Program to Understand Longterm
Outcomes of Spondyloarthritis (PULSAR). These studies will reveal crucial cellular networks and molecules
that cause AS and ultimately contribute knowledge needed to develop future patient-tailored treatment
strategies to improve the health of Veterans."
10807462,"Background: Social anxiety (SA), which broadly consists of fears related to being negatively
evaluated and avoidance of social situations (Alden & Taylor, 2010), is prevalent among both civilians
and Veterans (Byrne et al., 2021; Kessler et al., 2007). SA is associated with impairment across a
range of social/interpersonal domains. As a result, individuals with SA are at heightened risk for
experiencing loneliness, low self-efficacy, depression, and substance use, as well as unemployment
and poorer workplace productivity relative to individuals without SA. Despite its prevalence and
impact on functioning, the majority of individuals with SA do not seek treatment. Significance: The
proposed project has significant and immediate relevance to Veterans and the VHA in that it seeks to
assess the feasibility and acceptability of a self-monitoring intervention to decrease safety behaviors
(DSB-I) among Veterans with SA and SA associated functional impairment. The proposed
intervention is informed by a successful trial of the intervention in a community setting (Cougle et al.,
2020) and will be further developed and refined for optimal use with Veterans and for the VA in the
proposed SPiRE. Aside from addressing the critical need for targeted intervention within VA for SA
related impairment, the proposed study is innovative in its use of a novel technology-based intervention
that is resource light in terms of patient and provider demands and mitigates traditional barriers to
care. The proposed study design is also strengthened by a mixed methods approach heavily
informed by patient stakeholder feedback. Specific Aims: Aim 1: Establish feasibility and
acceptability of study methods and recruitment strategy using a single-arm study design of N=30
Veterans with SA and SA related impairment enrolled in a VA Compensated Work Therapy (CWT)
program. All Veterans will be enrolled to receive DSB-I. Variables of interest will include feasibility of
recruitment (e.g., proportion of Veterans approached/enrolled, proportion of Veterans who complete
the study assessments and intervention); Aim 2: Evaluate response to the intervention using post-
intervention survey data collected as part of Aim 1, and qualitative data (i.e., individual thematic
interviews) from a subset of Veterans who start DSB-I, to better evaluate participant response to the
intervention (e.g., ease of use of DSB-I, credibility/expectancy related to DSB-I, satisfaction with
DSB-I) as well as solicit suggestions for refinement of the intervention; Aim 3: Based on Veteran
feedback, refine the intervention and study methods as indicated for optimal use within VA and for
Veterans enrolled in CWT to support a future large scale RCT focused on efficacy of outcomes related
to improved functional recovery, social integration, and quality of life among Veterans seeking
reintegration into the workforce. Research Design & Methods: The proposed study will employ a
mixed-methods (quantitative/qualitative) approach with N=30 Veterans with SA enrolled in CWT.
Veterans of all ages, genders, ethnic/racial groups, military eras will be included in the study. All
enrolled Veterans will receive the intervention (DSB-I) and will be assessed post intervention. A
subset of ~20 Veterans who start the intervention will also be invited to participate in an individual
thematic interview during the post assessment window. Findings from this 2-year project will be used
to support a future larger randomized controlled trial focused on efficacy of outcomes related to
improved functional recovery, social integration, and quality of life among Veterans with SA."

10812481,"PROJECT SUMMARY
For the development of an organism from a single cell, the genome must be duplicated and precisely distributed
during every cell division. Given the astronomical number of cell division events involved in building and
maintaining organisms (by one estimate, the adult human body is made up of 40 trillion cells, with at least a
couple of trillion dividing every day), it becomes critical that the distribution of the replicated genome to daughter
cells, a process known as chromosome segregation, occurs with extremely high accuracy. Errors in chromosome
segregation underlie birth defects/infertility and are sufficient to trigger the genomic havoc that is a hallmark of
cancer. Thus, understanding the mechanisms by which cells ensure accurate chromosome segregation during
cell division has both fundamental and therapeutic significance. Our work is focused on kinetochores, protein
machines that assemble on mitotic chromosomes to orchestrate their segregation. Kinetochores coordinate
multiple microtubule-interfacing activities that collectively orient and segregate chromosomes, while also
integrating mechanical events with signaling mechanisms that control the decision to either remain in or exit from
mitosis. Our early work identified a conserved set of proteins, referred to as the KMN network (for Knl1 complex,
Mis12 complex, Ndc80 complex) that lies at the heart of these coordinated kinetochore functions. In Aim 1, we
focus on the ability of kinetochores to both accelerate and delay exit from mitosis, which we propose optimizes
mitotic duration to allow sufficient time for all chromosomes to connect to the spindle, while also minimizing time
spent in a vulnerable phase when major cellular functions such as transcription, translation and secretion are
downregulated. The work we propose tackles major open questions related to this duality of mitotic timing control
by kinetochores. The primary mechanical activity of the kinetochore is to couple to dynamic spindle microtubules.
Several distinct microtubule-interfacing activities concentrate at kinetochores as well as on mitotic chromatin,
which makes analysis of chromosome-microtubule interactions challenging in a cellular context. In Aim 2, we
describe a ""blank slate–add back"" approach, in which we eliminate all microtubule-interfacing activities on mitotic
chromosomes and then add them back in isolation. This approach complements traditional loss-of-function
analysis and will be used to study the microtubule-interfacing activities at kinetochores that orient and center
chromosomes on the spindle and that shut of the signal that prevents mitotic exit until microtubule attachments
are made. Finally, to achieve accurate segregation, kinetochore-microtubule interactions must be tightly
regulated. In Aim 3, we focus on the poorly understood regulatory mechanism by which a spindle pole-generated
gradient of the mitotic kinase Aurora A controls kinetochore-microtubule attachments. As Aurora A is amplified
in specific cancer contexts, this effort has the potential to reveal cancer-specific dysregulation of chromosome
segregation and suggest potential new therapeutic avenues."
10812364,"Project Summary
Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, afflicting ~1 million
Americans. Levodopa is the gold-standard symptomatic treatment for PD by elevating dopamine levels in the
brain. Though the most effective treatment, prolonged levodopa use leads to 1) the debilitating side effect,
levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID), and 2) diminished levodopa efficacy which leads to fluctuations of PD
symptoms, known as “wearing-off”. These concerns are two of the greatest unmet needs in PD and affect how
doctors prescribe dosages and treatment options, impacting the efficacy of the necessary medications for PD.
After 5 years of levodopa usage, 40% of PD patients will develop LID and/or fluctuations. Not only having a
clinical impact, but PD patients with such complications require nearly $60,000 of additional therapeutics every
year. Using Sinopia Biosciences’ computational platform, we studied gene expression changes due to
levodopa administered to 6-OHDA lesioned PD-like mice. Applying our computational workflow, we identified a
small molecule (SB-0107) that was selected based on: 1) having one of the top scores from our platform, 2) its
novel mechanism of action, 3) previous clinical exposure to elderly patients, 4) its predicted CNS penetration
properties, and 5) its potential for patent protection. Subsequently, we demonstrated the compound’s unique
and potentially transformative pharmacology for treating both the symptoms of PD and complications of
levodopa (i.e. LID). In both rodent and primate models, SB-0107 shows large effect sizes. Further, we
observed in a cognitive deficit primate model of PD that SB-0107 improves performances in the tested
cognitive tasks. Thus, SB-0107 represents a promising candidate for advancement to the clinic for PD. In this
Fast-Track proposal, we will advance the compound by completing preclinical development studies for
anticipation of IND submission."
10812365,"The fungal opportunistic pathogen, Pneumocystis (Pc) jirovecii is the causative agent of Pneumocystis
pneumonia (PCP), which is of increasing concern in persons receiving immunosuppressive therapies, including
organ transplant recipients, cancer patients, individuals with inflammatory disease and in persons experiencing
natural immunosuppression due to aging, congenital or acquired immunosuppressive states. In addition, in
clinical studies and in non-human primate models, we have shown that persistent Pc colonization is also
associated with the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Long-term goals of our
work are to develop vaccine strategies for the prevention of Pc infection and related pulmonary
sequelae in immunocompromised populations and to develop innovative strategies for improved
therapies for acute PCP in immunocompromised individuals. To achieve these goals, we have developed
pre-clinical, non-human primate models of PCP in drug-induced immunosuppressed animals. We have
previously identified a recombinant protein sub-unit vaccine, KEX1, that induces robust anti-Pc immunity in
non-human primates that is durable and protective against PCP following profound immunosuppression
induced by simian immunodeficiency virus infection (SIV) and reported that antibodies to KEX1 are associated
with prevention of PCP in human immunocompromised individuals. The objectives to be addressed in the
proposed studies are 1) to determine the protective efficacy of the KEX1 vaccine in pre-clinical models of
therapeutic immunosuppressive regimens, (e.g., as in organ transplantation) and 2), to harness our extensive
data regarding the protective nature of the humoral responses to KEX1 for the development and testing of
monoclonal antibodies (mAb) for use in treating acute PCP. We hypothesize that the KEX1 vaccine will induce
durable and protective immunity against PCP in immunocompromised individuals. We further hypothesize that
treatment of acute PCP with KEX1 mAbs will contribute to resolution of pneumonia and mitigate pulmonary
damage associated with the infection. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that immunization with KEX1 vaccine will
elicit protective memory responses and will provide protection from PCP in immunocompromised NHPs. We
will evaluate the durability and protective efficacy of the immune response during immunosuppressive therapy.
NHPs will be challenged via natural exposure to Pneumocystis and evaluated for clinical disease, immunity,
pulmonary function and pathology. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that KEX1-specific mAbs will effectively treat
established PCP in an immunosuppression NHP model. Our innovative technology in mAb generation,
combined with a unique and clinically relevant model of PCP in immunosuppressed monkeys, will allow us to
define the utility of KEX1 mAbs in treating PCP and advance a novel therapeutic avenue for this disease."
10812333,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Fascioliasis in an important zoonic infection with a worldwide distribution. It is a significant public health problem
in poor rural communities in countries of South America, Middle East, Asia, and Africa. School age children bear
a disproportionate burden of the diseases suffering from anemia and stunted growth. Fasciola causes substantial
economic losses in livestock production in developed and developing countries. It has a complex epidemiology
stemming from its capacity to infect multiple definitive hosts and more than 30 species of snails and adapt to
multiple environments. Despite Fasciola’s inclusion in the WHO neglected tropical diseases list very little
progress in parasite control has been achieved. Mass treatment has been the preferred control intervention in
human and livestock. However, a single drug, triclabendazole, is recommended for treatment and control in
humans and preferred for livestock. Concerns for decreasing efficacy of triclabendazole have been raised in
endemic countries. Tools to predict fascioliasis risk and guide preventive interventions have focused on livestock.
Most models have ignored human infection risk and factor associated with vulnerability such as treatment failure,
poverty, and susceptibility. Out TMRC application proposes using a comprehensive One Health approach to
study human transmission of Fasciola in two sites of the Peruvian highlands. Our approach will consider the
spatial and temporal association of fascioliasis in snail intermediate hosts, livestock, human, and the
environment. Importantly we will include studies to tackle factors that modify the risk of infection among human
such as weather and land use, hinder diagnosis and surveillance such as the lack of simple diagnostic tests to
use in all hosts, and the potential effects of chronic infection on treatment response and infection susceptibility.
We will use agent-based modeling to identify crucial steps in transmission and potential areas of intervention
that could be address simultaneous with a large impact on transmission and small impact on the environment
and drug effectiveness. At the end of our TMRC we expect to gain substantial insights into human Fasciola
transmission and to identify potential integrated control interventions, simple sensitive tools to diagnose and
surveil infection, and immune mechanisms behind drug effectiveness and infection susceptibility."
10812417,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Over 10% of the world’s population has chronic kidney disease (CKD), and cardiovascular disease is a primary
cause of morbidity and mortality. Approximately 50% of patients with advanced CKD die from cardiovascular
disease. However, there is limited evidence to inform optimal strategies for prevention and treatment of
cardiovascular disease in this population. The pathology of cardiovascular disease may differ in the presence
of CKD compared to the general population, and cardiovascular therapy may have distinct risks and benefits.
Guidelines on the use of medications to prevent or treat cardiovascular disease in persons with CKD are often
unclear or conflicting. The overarching goal of this K24 application is to address major gaps in the evidence
surrounding cardiovascular disease development, prevention, and treatment in patients with CKD, providing
junior investigators with the rigorous training and mentorship needed in order to advance the field. The
candidate, Dr. Morgan Grams, MD PhD, is a nephrologist and epidemiologist with expertise in clinical research
methods and a strong track record of successful mentorship. Dr. Grams’s research portfolio provides ample
data and opportunity to address clinically important questions at the intersection of cardiovascular disease and
CKD, including the molecular basis of cardiovascular prognosis in CKD as well as the safety and effectiveness
of approved cardiovascular therapy across the range of kidney function. The K24 will allow Dr. Grams to
expand her mentoring to ensure the next generation of patient-oriented researchers are able to take advantage
of the ever-growing availability of health care data to complement and enhance pre-clinical work and clinical
trials."
10815768,"Project Summary:
The prevalence of debilitating chronic pain in people with spinal cord injury (SCI) ranges from 65-85%. Chronic
pain after SCI contributes to anxiety, depression and diminishes the health-related quality of life (QOL).
Pharmacological agents such as opioids are the primary therapeutic options to manage chronic pain after SCI,
but are ineffective in relieving pain and associated with significant side effects. Mindfulness meditation training
(MM) has been shown to improve mental and physical symptoms, including pain-related interference, in many
studies of people without SCI who have chronic pain. However, these interventions are typically lengthy,
expensive, and require in-person visits with a therapist, making them inaccessible to many people with SCI.
Mounting evidence suggests that mobile apps may provide an effective and low-cost way to provide MM.
Indeed, one recent study found that internet-based MM training led to reduced pain interference and improved
mental health in people with SCI and chronic pain, suggesting app-based MM interventions may have promise
in this population. However, this study used an intervention created by the researchers which is not currently
available to the public for free, limiting large-scale dissemination. Additionally, the feasibility found in that study
may not necessarily translate to that of an existing, publicly available app-based MM intervention among
persons with SCI. Similarly, the feasibility of other app-based MM interventions for non-SCI populations may
not translate to persons with SCI due to the specific physiological limitations experienced by person with SCI.
 Our multidisciplinary, interinstitutional team of investigators proposes to randomize 60 SCI patients
experiencing chronic pain to practice audio-guided MM for ≥ 10 minutes daily for 6 weeks using the free app
“Mindfulness Coach” developed by the Department of Veteran Affairs, or to view TED talks for ≥ 10 minutes
daily for 6 weeks on the free TED app (active control). Primary outcomes are the feasibility and
acceptability of proposed interventions in people with SCI and chronic pain. Secondary outcomes include the
feasibility of collecting patient-reported outcomes of pain, anxiety, depression, mindfulness, and quality of life.
 Given the great need for remotely delivered, low-cost chronic pain management and unique physiological
limitations among person with SCI, it is essential to determine the feasibility and acceptability of a free,
publicly available app-based MM intervention prior to conducting a larger efficacy study. With the emerging use
of telemedicine in this COVID-19 era, therapy-focused apps and remote data collection are becoming
increasingly popular making this line of inquiry both timely and innovative. Furthermore, the app-guided MM
intervention has the potential to facilitate self-management of pain by persons with SCI, as the MM exercises
can be practiced at the individual’s preferred time and place. The long-term goal of this study is to improve pain
management and QOL of people with SCI living with chronic pain by identifying affordable and accessible app-
guided interventions which can be used as an adjuvant tool after SCI in conjunction with other treatments."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development is a period of neurobehavioral changes requiring immature organisms to exhibit behavioral flexibility to adapt to the world. A traditional
view of development sees existing brain circuits becoming more complex to accommodate behavioral change. While certainly sometimes true, additional research suggests that developing organisms must sometimes change the neural circuitry evoked by a specific event for expression of the more mature behavior. For example, as infants transition from dependence on the mother to independence, at least some new neural circuits will be required for new adaptive behaviors to be expressed. Yet we know little about these transitions, despite recent evidence suggesting these transitions are periods of vulnerability for initiation of pathways to pathology and developmental disorders. The purpose of this proposal is to explore developmental transitions using our model of infant rat learning. Specifically, we explore a brief 5 day period in developing rat pups when they rapidly transition between attachment learning and amygdala-dependent adult-like fear learning - both supported by odor-shock pairings - which learning system is engaged is controlled by maternal presence. In Aim 1, we test the hypothesis that prefrontal cortical (PFC) subareas' development and their control by the mother contributes to pups' ability to transition between attachment learning and amygdala-dependent fear learning. We include analysis of individual PFC-amygdala brain areas but also use a novel analytical tool to assess functional connectivity - a technique similar to fMRI analysis to facilitte translational research. Aim 2 extends these networks by testing causal roles of specific network nodes. Finally, Aim 3 examines the role of dopamine, an important modulator in PFC-amygdala function in these age- and context-dependent changes in behavioral flexibility over early development. This research has health relevance in at least two areas. First, this developmental approach assesses PFC and amygdala as individual brain areas, but also with functional connectivity analysis to go beyond defining the role of a brain area to expand our understanding of its role in a larger circuit to evoke adaptive behaviors. Indeed, both dysfunction of individual
brain areas and disrupted functional connectivity have been implicated in myriad developmental disorders, including depression and ADHD. Second, this ecologically relevant approach highlights mother-infant interactions to better explain how maternal presence alters the child's behavior by expanding our understanding of how the caregiver alters brain function and neurobehavioral transitions."
10815777,"The application of antibiotics to the treatment of bacterial infections revolutionized modern medical practice. In the decades since, a combination of improperly controlled usage and the remarkable ability of bacterial populations to develop resistance to these drugs has severely restricted the clinical usefulness of many antibiotics. We are now at a critical juncture where the majority of useful antibiotics have known and sometimes extensive resistance, and few novel replacements or strategies to combat the resistance problem are in active development. Many clinically useful antibiotics target the bacterial ribosome. One increasingly prevalent form of resistance to these drugs is alteration of the modification status of the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) via acquired or intrinsic methyltransferase enzymes. While enzymes responsible for incorporating these antibiotic resistance- associated rRNA modifications are known, we understand far less about their mechanisms of action (such as specific substrate recognition), which might offer viable new targets to counter the resistance. Further, we also currently have a poor understanding of the molecular basis for how rRNA methylation affects ribosome-antibiotic interactions. The experiments proposed in this application will directly address these critical gaps in our fundamental knowledge of rRNA methylation and bacterial antibiotic resistance. In the first two aims we will define the molecular mechanisms of ribosome subunit recognition by two different rRNA modification enzymes, the acquired aminoglycoside-resistance 16S rRNA (m7G1405) methyltransferases (Aim 1) and the intrinsic Mycobacterium tuberculosis methyltransferase TlyA (Aim 2). Next, we will develop a new computational and experimental framework for understanding antibiotic-methylated rRNA interactions (Aim 3). Our goal is to explain at the molecular level how rRNA modifications limit drug efficacy and how these effects can be evaded. Collectively, the results of these three independent but complementary aims will deepen our fundamental understanding of the molecular strategies used by rRNA modification enzymes and the impacts of rRNA methylation on antibiotic resistance in bacteria. Our results will support future innovative strategies to counter the resistance conferred by these enzymes, for example, by facilitating the development of inhibitors of m7G1405 methyltransferase activity or 30S substrate binding, and could also lead to the rational design of novel antimicrobials capable of fully evading the effects of rRNA modification."

10817083,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron is a beneficial gut bacterium strongly associated with lean and
healthy individuals. This proposal seeks to understand how colonization of the mammalian gut
by B. thetaiotaomicron is promoted by atypical forms of three highly conserved proteins: a
paralog of the essential translation factor EF-G, designated EF-G2; the essential transcription
termination factor Rho (BtRho), which harbors a ~300-residue long domain absent from
canonical Rho proteins and specifically required for gut colonization; and Roc, a transcriptional
regulator silenced by the simple sugars glucose and fructose. First, we will identify the
biochemical properties of EF-G2 that distinguish it from EF-G and render it necessary for gut
colonization, and test the hypothesis that EF-G2 is an energy-saving translation factor because it
lacks the guanosine triphosphate hydrolyzing activity in the presence of vacant ribosomes that
characterizes EF-G. Second, we will investigate the signals, genes, and regions of the extra
domain that determine liquid-liquid phase separation in BtRho and identify genes regulated by
the extra domain of BtRho. And third, we will determine how simple sugars control Roc amounts
via the 5' leader region of the roc mRNA and identify genes controlled by Roc when B.
thetaiotaomicron is in the murine gut. The proposed research will reveal novel biochemical
activities for widespread proteins and uncover novel colonization determinants. Moreover, it will
directly advance the engineering of commensal bacteria with desirable properties."

Difficulties in employment and postsecondary education (PSE) among young adults with ASD (YA-ASD) are
nearly universal. In response, interventions have been developed that target obtaining a job or gaining
admittance to a PSE program. However, our preliminary research suggests that maintaining a job or PSE
enrollment is more difficult than obtaining those positions in the first place, and the predictors of keeping a job
(e.g., family climate, community size) are different than those associated with starting a job (e.g., autism
severity, IQ). These studies suggest the need for new interventions focused on maintaining employment or
PSE. Further, vocational instability (e.g., losing a job) is a significant predictor of poor mental health in the
general population, and might be responsible, at least in part, for the very high rates of co-occurring
psychopathology among YA-ASD. The objective of the proposed research is to lay the groundwork for novel
interventions to promote sustained employment/educational participation, by prospectively examining
predictors and potential consequences of postsecondary employment and educational instability (i.e., loss
of/change in employment or educational position that is not reflective of upward mobility) for YA-ASD. To
accomplish this objective, we will collect prospective longitudinal data from 200 YA-ASD and their parents at 7
times over a 3-year period. We will recruit young adults who have exited high school, between the ages of 18
and 26, who have an IQ score of 70 or above. We will use multiple informants (self, parent) and multiple
methods (interviews, questionnaires, permanent products, diagnostic evaluations) to measure individual,
family, and community factors, and employment/educational instability during the transition years. We propose
four Aims: 1) To determine rates of instability in postsecondary employment/education over a 3-year period,
and differentiate instability from upward mobility as experienced by YA-ASD: 2) To examine individual, family,
and community factors that predict postsecondary employment/educational activities at the first wave of data
collection, and instability in these activities over a 3-year period: 3) To examine bidirectional effects of
employment/educational instability and changes in autism severity, mental health, adaptive behavior, and
quality of life for YA-ASD: and 4) Using well-validated measures new to ASD research along with open-ended
questions and permanent products, we will explore specific aspects of work/PSE activities and environment
(job characteristics and experiences, job satisfaction, workplace environment, supports) associated with
stability/instability. This study is responsive to the 2016-17 Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee
Strategic Plan by using a longitudinal prospective design and collecting data with enough specificity to inform
targeted interventions. The project will have high public health impact by providing new knowledge that can be
translated rapidly into novel interventions to support YA-ASD in maintaining employment/educational positions."

We propose a two-part integrated mixed-methods project to help improve our understanding of the social media
landscape for adolescents, especially those with mental illnesses, and further accountability of new technology.
Research has documented a concurrent adolescent mental health crisis with mixed effects of the potential role
of social media: social media has become an important source of mental health information for the public yet
unsafe content is also prevalent such as stigma, cyber-bullying, and hate speech. Efforts designed to study
social media have produced only limited success owing to how social media data is dynamic and unique for each
user and privately owned/managed in the tech sector; no national/public archive exists. Further, web-scraping
methods (e.g., Twitter API) do not yield representative or random samples for study, and web-scraping and
survey methods are not yet available for the most popular apps among adolescents of Instagram, Snapchat, and
TikTok, or for capturing content in Spanish, limiting both internal and external validity. Extant efforts are thus
incongruent with how Latino adolescents use social media more than all other race/ethnic and age groups in the
U.S. New approaches are needed that address these methodological problems in a comprehensive fashion that
is informed by research and suited to the ecological context surrounding diverse adolescent populations.
Responding to this critical need, the proposed project seeks a rigorous test, with long term follow-up, participatory
approaches, and both quantitative and qualitative methods. Also, to gain new causal insights and further mental
health equity goals, this project focuses on Latinos ages 13-20 to leverage natural counterfactual contexts across
their diverse language/cultural social media exposure. Specifically, we will examine the effects of exposure to
mental health promoting (Aim 1) and pejorative (Aim 2) content encountered on social media on mental health
status, and how this relationship operates via proposed mediators of mental illness stigma, self-perceptions, and
help-seeking. Moderation by individual (e.g., age, gender, race), family (e.g., cohesion), and peer (e.g., social
support) factors will be assessed, and by mental health status to identify directionality (Aim 3). Achieved in two
parts, Part 1 is a prospective cohort design (N=1200) of three biweekly assessments of social media use and its
mental health content, potential mediators, modifiers/covariates, and mental health status. Part 2 involves Youth
Participatory Action Research (N=50) with SocialsVoice, an adaptation of PhotoVoice, to glean a culturally
relevant social media database for community-based analysis. The generated knowledge from the evaluation of
data in Parts 1-2 will together inform recommendations for intervention by identifying specific problems and target
populations with respect to social media and mental health, cuing how to best leverage the strengths of
adolescent ecological contexts to innovatively promote mental health. The proposed project and team to
implement it will provide public mental health with critical new knowledge it sorely needs to inform programs,
policies, and practices concerning the safety and utility of social media as it relates to population mental health."

10820411,"Pancreatic beta-cell mass expansion occurs in the early stages of obesity and insulin resistance. Conversely, humans with diabetes have reduced numbers and diminished function of pancreatic beta-cells, indicating that islet beta-cell expansion and loss are dynamic processes subject to signal-induced regulation. Using external cues that signal demand for insulin, or that produce insulin resistance, we queried changes in gene expression in rodent and human beta-cells for inducible genes linked with growth and proliferation pathways. This approach yielded the serum and glucocorticoid inducible kinase 1 (SGK1), which is rapidly upregulated after exposure to cytokines, glucose, glucocorticoids, and lipids. Thus, we created mice lacking SGK1 in pancreatic beta-cells to address the fundamentally important question: does inhibition of SGK1 in islet beta-cells block their ability to expand during states of caloric overload and insulin resistance? Our preliminary data shows that SGK1 deletion in beta-cells restricts islet mass expansion during high-fat feeding. Intriguingly, SGK1 inhibition in beta-cells augmented insulin secretion in vitro and in vivo, resulting in improved whole-body glucose tolerance. Based on these preliminary data, we hypothesize that restricting beta-cell proliferation has the added benefit of improving stimulus-secretion coupling to promote insulin secretion. To test this overarching hypothesis, the following aims are proposed. Specific Aim 1 will investigate how SGK1 regulates beta-cell mass in response to signals that create a demand for insulin. Using in vivo approaches that build on our preliminary data using mice with beta- cell deletion of SGK1, we will investigate the early changes in beta-cell proliferation using two established experimental paradigms: high-fat feeding and continuous glucose infusion. Specific Aim 2 will investigate the mechanisms underlying enhanced proliferation and alterations in insulin secretion. In this aim, we propose several ex vivo comprehensive analyses to address key pathways supporting proliferation versus insulin secretion by coupling RNA sequencing techniques with stable isotope tracer-based metabolomics analyses. These studies, in combination with additional mechanistic approaches, are designed to reveal how substrate usage is altered by caloric excess to drive beta-cell mass expansion and importantly, how SGK1 inhibition limits this response to improve metabolic outcomes. Completing these Aims will reveal the critical SGK1-dependent molecular events responsible for regulating islet beta-cell changes in growth and secretory function during caloric overload, obesity, and insulin resistance. Collectively, the results of these studies are expected to inform the future design of therapies targeting cellular growth mechanisms important for diagnosing and treating metabolic diseases."
10820546,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Interactions between different biomolecules, including proteins, lipids and metabolites, give rise to higher cellular,
tissue and organismal phenotypes and functions. Perturbation of these interaction networks is observed during
aging and in age-related diseases and identification of these changes can help identify contributing mechanisms.
This may be particularly valuable in case of complex diseases, such as late-onset Alzheimer’s Disease and
Related Dementias (AD/ADRD), with multiple contributing factors over a life span.
 Biomolecule networks are affected not only by the overall abundance of individual components but also by
their distribution between specific cell types and localization to intracellular compartments. Although snRNA-seq
advances allow identification of cell-type specific gene expression patterns in many tissues including the brain,
cell-type and organelle-specific proteomic, lipidomic and metabolomic assessments remain challenging.
Additionally, integration of the various “omics” data and defining the influence of these changes on cellular, tissue
and organismal function presents an ongoing challenge. This poses a limitation, as understanding of disease
states requires consideration of interactions between different classes of biomolecules and associated pathways.
 To address these challenges, we propose to develop an analytical multi-omics pipeline to identify cell-type
and organelle-specific functional relationships between different omics parameters and their effects on organellar,
cellular, tissue and organismal function during brain aging and in age-related neurodegenerative disease.
Consistent with their known contribution to brain aging and neurodegeneration, our initial focus will be on
interactions between lipid and protein networks specifically in mitochondria. We will use transgenic reporter mice
and optimize MS-based analytical approaches to determine cell-type (microglial and neuronal) specific changes
in mitochondrial lipidome and proteome and their influence on mitochondrial function during brain aging (AIM 1).
We will develop machine learning-based tools and workflows to allow integrated analysis of proteomic and
lipidomic data to generate testable hypotheses about mechanisms contributing to aging and to identify potential
novel intervention targets (AIM 2). Eventually the focus will be expanded to include other compartments
(lysosomes and lipid droplets) relevant to brain aging and AD/ADRD (AIM 3). Once established, our multi-omics
pipeline and tools will be made available to members of UMB, UMCP and other researchers interested in
understanding brain aging, neurodegeneration and other age-related processes."
10820489,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are important targets of hormones, neurotransmitters and approximately
one-third of FDA-approved drugs. These receptors signal by coupling to transducer proteins from four families
of heterotrimeric G proteins and a family of four arrestins. Recent structural and functional studies have defined
a conventional allosteric mechanism whereby ligand binding to receptors promotes activation of G proteins and
arrestins. However, there is extensive functional diversity across hundreds of GPCRs and sixteen G proteins,
and many examples of physiology and pharmacology do not conform to the conventional model. For example,
we have found significant variability in the mechanism whereby GPCRs select appropriate G proteins, and
some receptors that recognize unconventional G protein determinants for selectivity. We have also found some
receptors that paradoxically inhibit G protein signaling instead of the usual activation, a type of GPCR-G
protein coupling that is unproductive. Finally, we have found receptors that associate with G proteins prior to
ligand binding and on average release G proteins after activation, a type of inverse coupling that can explain
the unusal pharmacology of such receptors. A complete understanding of GPCR-mediated signaling will
require a better understanding of these unconventional GPCR-G protein coupling mechanisms. In addition, it
will be necessary to translate molecular studies carried out with overexpressed molecules in model cells to
endogenously-expressed GPCRs and G proteins in their native context, where expression levels, stoichiometry
and subcellular compartmentalization more closely match the in vivo situation. Accordingly, we will carry out
studies to map unconventional selectivity determinants, determine the prevalence and physiological
significance of unproductive and inverse GPCR-G protein coupling, and to better understand the
conformational dynamics of GPCRs in cell membranes, and how this conformational landscape changes as
receptors bind ligands and interact with transducer molecules."

The adult mammalian heart shows little or no significant innate regeneration of cardiac muscle after injury, and
instead heals by scarring. This regenerative deficiency has major socioeconomic consequences, given that
ischemic myocardial infarction is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States and over 5
million Americans suffer from heart failure. Many years ago, we found that the teleost zebrafish displays a
vigorous regenerative response after partial resection of the cardiac ventricle, involving creation of new
cardiomyocytes with little or no scarring. This discovery pioneered the model system approach to heart
regeneration that is employed by many laboratories today. For the past 15 years, the principal investigator has
introduced new tools and strategies to reveal many key concepts and mechanisms underlying heart
regeneration in zebrafish. Here, we describe an integrative program that defines at new resolution the
molecular components of innate heart regeneration, as well as mechanisms by which these components are
regulated. We will harness this information to innovate new methods for controlling the efficacy of heart
regeneration across species, including attempts to stimulate regeneration in mammals through factor delivery
and gene regulation using viral vectors. The discoveries we make will continue to inform the fundamental
biology of heart regeneration, and they will directly relate to ideas and methods to enhance regeneration and
reduce the incidence of heart failure in humans. They are also likely to extend beyond cardiovascular biology
and have relevance to the repair of other tissues."
10817018,"The incidence and geographic distribution of Lyme disease in the U.S. has increased steadily since its first
description in 1977. Efforts to stem the spread of the disease through controlling the population of its tick
vector and/or the mouse reservoirs of the disease have met with only limited success. The only approved
human vaccine to protect against Lyme disease was removed from the market by its manufacturer further
highlighting the need for new approaches to controlling the disease.
 In this project, we propose the development of a novel antibiotic targeted towards the mouse and tick
reservoirs of the disease. This proposal combines the expertise in drug development of Dr. Kim Lewis’
laboratory, the expertise in Borrelia burgdorferi biology in Dr. Linden Hu’s laboratory and the field expertise of
Dr. Sam Telford’s laboratory. Treatment of mice with an antibiotic, doxycycline, has been shown to be highly
effective in eradicating Borrelia burgdorferi from its reservoir hosts. However, there is legitimate concern for
development of resistance, both in B. burgdorferi and in other organisms that may be exposed to the antibiotic
should it be widely distributed. Doxycyline is an important antibiotic in the treatment of multiple different human
infections and in some cases such as Anaplasma or Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, the only approved agent
available. We have identified an antibiotic, hygromycin A (HygA), that is highly active against B. burgdorferi but
has limited activity against other human pathogens. Its mechanism of action is different from other human
antibiotics. In our preliminary data, we have shown that it is very effective in clearing B. burgdorferi from
infected mice when given orally by gavage or in bait formulations. In this proposal, we will complete the steps
in developing HygA as an environmental antibiotic and perform a limited field trial on an isolated island off the
coast of MA to test its ability to control infection rates in ticks and mice.
 In Aim 1, we will establish the pharmacodynamics, stability and safety profile of HygA in Peromyscus mice.
We will determine optimum concentrations for bait distribution and perform simulation studies of bait uptake
and clearance in caged animals. In Aim 2, we will attempt to induce resistance to HygA in B. burgdorferi and in
other organisms of human importance that are likely to encounter HygA in the environment. We will confirm
that if HygA resistance develops, it does not cause concomitant resistance to other antibiotics with human
applications. Finally, in Aim 3, we will perform a limited field trial on an isolated island that is endemic for B.
burgdorferi in ticks and mice to establish the efficacy of a HygA based reservoir targeted antibiotic approach.
 This study has the potential to have a major impact on human Lyme disease by controlling the organism in
its major reservoirs. By utilizing an antibiotic that has a narrow spectrum of activity and does not have human
applications, we hope to replicate the success seen with doxycycline, which is arguably the most successful
trial of any environmental approach to eradication to date, without the attendant concerns for resistance."

Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) is an aging associated condition characterized by the clonal outgrowth of
mutated pre-leukemic cells. Although individuals with CH are healthy, they are at an increased risk of
developing hematopoietic malignancies. To identify cooperating molecular alterations required for
malignant transformation of clonal pre-leukemic HSPC, we performed an in vivo shRNA screen and found
that shRNAs targeting Traf6 were overwhelmingly enriched in following transformation to overt myeloid
leukemias. TRAF6 is an ubiquitin E3 ligase that synthesizes Lysine (K) 63-linked ubiquitin chains on
substrates leading to Toll-like receptor (TLR) superfamily pathway activation. In support of our in vivo
shRNA screen, promoter hypermethylation and reduced expression of TRAF6 is observed in subsets of
myeloid malignancy patients, including ~40-50% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Moreover, our
preliminary data shows that deletion of Traf6 in pre-leukemic Tet2-deficient HSPC results in an aggressive
myeloid neoplasm in part through a novel MYC-dependent mechanism. Based on our findings, we
hypothesize that loss of TRAF6 drives subsets of genetically-defined myeloid malignancies, specifically
via a novel post-translational modification of MYC resulting in its activation. The objectives of the proposal
are to uncover the molecular and cellular basis of TRAF6 deletion on pre-leukemic HSPC function with the
long-term goal of uncovering improved therapeutic approaches by investigating the consequences of
TRAF6 deletion in models of CH and on leukemia development (Aim 1), identifying the molecular basis of
the tumor suppressor-like function of TRAF6 in AML (Aim 2), and evaluating the oncogenic potential of a
novel TRAF6-dependent MYC post-translational modification (Aim 3). These studies are highly significant
as they will provide critical insight into the progression of pre-leukemic states to overt leukemia as a result
of subverting select innate immune pathways, describe a novel disease-modifying role of TLR-TRAF6, and
reveal an unreported mechanism of MYC regulation. These studies have direct translational implications
and fill an unmet clinical need for genetically- and phenotypically-defined subtypes of AML/MPN."

 Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia affect over five million Americans. Alzheimer's disease
begins with changes in the brain more than a decade before the disease can be diagnosed from memory and
cognitive impairment in a clinic. The goal of this work is to provide a way to measure early signs of
neurodegeneration in individual people. The historical barrier to measure change in individuals is that each
person's brain is different with change accumulating too slowly to be picked over short intervals. As a result,
most research focuses on tracking averaged subject groups or tracking change over multiple years. The
present work optimizes new brain imaging techniques using MRI to make extremely fast, highly precise
repeated measurements of brain regions all within the same individual. The work then seeks to use the novel
imaging approach to measure neurodegeneration in individuals with early stages of Alzheimer's disease in six
months or less and also differentiate changes in people with Alzheimer's disease from less common forms of
dementia that have distinct anatomical changes in the brain. If successful, the present work will provide a new
means to track the early stages of neurodegeneration as would be used in clinical trials and translational
medical research."

Endometriosis affects an estimated 176 million women and girls of reproductive age, worldwide, causing chronic

this project is to explore the genetic basis for endometriosis pathophysiology through the application of innovative
technologies and model systems. We have successfully produced induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) derived
from blood cells of women with endometriosis and developed a novel microfluidic device capable of co-culturing
cells and tissues. In this study, we aim to differentiate iPSCs into endometrial epithelial and stromal cells, as well
as macrophages, and compare their behavior to that of cells derived from women without the condition. By using
the microfluidic device, we will construct an endometriosis-immune chip that will enable us to investigate the
interaction of endometrial cells with macrophages from endometriosis. Furthermore, we will conduct a
comprehensive analysis of DNA variants in the iPSC lines and correlate them with gene expression and cell
function, providing a comprehensive, unbiased, and global perspective of inherent differences in endometriosis
cells. These cutting-edge technologies will allow us to explore previously unexplored areas of research, offering
significant insights into endometriosis and advancing the field of endometriosis research considerably."

Black cisgender women (hereafter, Black women) carry a disproportionate HIV burden than women in other
racial and ethnic groups. Despite its promise, there is an unmet need for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) among
Black women. Intimate partner violence (IPV) and gendered racism may exacerbate racial disparities in PrEP
access and also curb potential real-world effectiveness. IPV reduces PrEP uptake among women. Black women
also experience unfair treatment due to deeply ingrained stereotypes by healthcare systems. As such, Black
women may feel uncomfortable discussing PrEP with a provider or provider biases may prevent PrEP access.
Integrating trauma-informed care into community health centers that serve Black women may enhance PrEP
adoption. Trauma-informed care can help providers understand IPV, medical mistrust and gendered racism
within the context of Black women’s experiences. System policies can also be modified to be trauma-informed
for both staff and Black women clients. In addition to changing health systems, peer navigation could be a
successful model of care to improve PrEP engagement. Peer navigation can build self-efficacy in patient-provider
communication and decrease medical mistrust offsetting the impact of socio-structural barriers. The proposed
research aims to address this gap via the implementation and evaluation of a trauma-informed multilevel
intervention designed to increase PrEP initiation among Black women. This intervention includes a trauma-
informed PrEP Implementation Toolkit for staff in community healthcare clinics in addition to a trauma-informed
peer navigation model. We propose a hybrid type 2 effectiveness-implementation study with clinical staff, peer
navigators, and clients. Aim 1 includes adapting an existing trauma-informed peer navigation for PrEP-eligible
Black women. Qualitative data from semi-structured interviews with 20 Black women clients will be used to adapt
the peer navigation. Aim 2 includes assessing the effectiveness of the trauma-informed multilevel intervention.
The toolkit will be employed in clinics using a stepped wedge design with monthly aggregated clinic data collected
8 months before and after toolkit implementation in each clinic. Toolkit effectiveness will be assessed using
within- and between-clinic changes in PrEP initiation. Staff will complete baseline, immediate post, and 3-month
post surveys to assess mechanisms of change. In a parallel two-arm trial, 300 Black women clients will be
randomized to receive either peer navigation (intervention arm) or support group only (control arm) and will
complete baseline, 1-, 3-, and 6- month post-randomization surveys. The primary client outcomes will be 1-, 3-,
and 6-month PrEP initiation. Aim 3 includes assessing the implementation of the multilevel intervention.
Adoption, acceptability, appropriateness, and sustainability will be assessed with 3-month post-toolkit staff
surveys; and at 1-, 3-, and 6- month client post-randomization surveys. Intervention costs will be computed using
an ingredients-based approach. Fidelity will be assessed with the fidelity-monitoring approach for multilevel trials."

Heart failure (HF) affects 6.5 million individuals in the US (87). Diabetes and HF frequently occur
together and each disorder increases the risk for the other. Recent trials (9-16) have
demonstrated that SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) reduce hospitalization for heart failure and
cardiovascular (CV) mortality. However, the mechanism(s) via which the SGLT2i benefit heart
failure remain to be determined. Following SGLT2i therapy the plasma ketone concentration
rises. Ketones are avidly taken up by the myocardium and, when oxidized, generate more ATP
per molecule of oxygen compared to glucose and fatty acids. Therefore, the SGLT2i-induced rise
in plasma ketones has been suggested to explain the drug’s beneficial effect on the heart. In
Protocol I of the present grant we will examine in type 2 diabetic subjects with HF and reduced
ejection fraction the effect of three infusion rates of beta-hydroxybutyrate (designed to span the
physiologic and pharmacologic range of plasma ketone concentrations) on: (1) LV systolic and

the dapagliflozin-induced rise in plasma ketone concentration with acipimox can block the

lipolysis, reduces the plasma ketone concentration to <0.02 mM and has no other known

alcohol use disorders (AUD) were attributed to 99.2 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) while illicit
substance use disorders (SUD) were attributed to 31.8 million DALYs lost in 2016. Despite the urgent need to
reduce the public health impacts of ASUD and scale up efficacious interventions, treatment uptake worldwide
remains low. Psychosocial and structural factors are major barriers to ASUD treatment and engagement. For
example, psychological distress, polysubstance use, homelessness, incarceration, and engagement in sex work
have been associated with lower ASUD treatment coverage and completion. When these factors co-occur, they
may also generate synergistic negative effects that contribute to less optimal health outcomes and greater
disease burden (defined as syndemics). Less research has empirically examined the syndemic effects of
psychosocial and structural barriers on ASUD treatment and treatment engagement. To optimize ASUD
treatments and maximize engagement, there’s an urgent need to examine the syndemic relationship of these
conditions, especially across multiple and diverse studies. To address these gaps, Dr. Santos proposes to
expand his patient oriented research (POR) program, and expand his capacity to train early stage investigators
(ESIs), particularly those from underrepresented backgrounds. Dr. Santos will provide experiential training for
ESIs in three complementary POR projects (Projects A, B, and C) that will examine the barriers to ASUD
treatment access and engagement, and explore treatment preferences of individuals with ASUD. Project A will
examine the syndemic effects of psychosocial and structural conditions on the use of ASUD treatment (AIM 1),
and the moderators of those effects (AIM 2), leveraging five National HIV Behavioral Survey cycles (cumulative
n=3848) using an Integrative Data Analysis (IDA) approach. Project B will examine the syndemic effects of
psychosocial and structural conditions on ASUD treatment outcomes (AIM 3), and the moderators of those
effects (AIM 4), leveraging 10 ASUD pharmacotherapy trials (cumulative n=722), also using an IDA approach.
Project C will examine the preferred treatment attributes of individuals with ASUD using Discrete Choice
Experiments (DCE; AIM 5) and examine how preferences differ between groups (AIM 6) among 250 individuals
with ASUD. Ultimately, the findings from this study will be fill critical gaps in ASUD treatment implementation,
particularly for key populations disproportionately impacted by HIV. In parallel to these research projects, Dr.
Santos will provide structured mentoring and training to ESIs in three key areas of support: instrumental,
professional and social. Instrumental support will focus on building ESIs capacity to become independent
researchers. Professional support will focus on career development skills to thrive in research. Finally, social
support aims to increase their social capital and resilience through networking opportunities, group social
activities, and individual coaching."
10818799,"PROJECT ABSTRACT: ADMINISTRATIVE CORE
 The primary objective of the Administrative Core (AC) is to serve as the leadership, coordination and
communication hub for the Dartmouth Learning Health System (LHS) Embedded Scientist Training and
Research (E-STaR) Center. The proposed Center’s focus on developing future LHS leaders in PCOR/CER is
grounded in a coproduction LHS, which explicitly recognizes and prioritizes the collective expertise of patients,
their care partners, clinical teams, health system operations and quality improvement leaders, and the larger
communities in which we live and work.
 The AC will support the Center by establishing and carrying out processes for recruitment, selection and
retention of a diverse group of LHS scientists. The AC will support the Research Education Core’s (REC)
activities, which include the development, implementation and tracking of 18-month tailored training plans
designed to meet each scientists needs in PCOR/CER and LHS competencies. Scientist’s experiential learning
will involve conducting a PCOR/CER project that will be guided and supported by the Research and Data
Analysis Core (RDAC) from design through dissemination of evidence-based findings, including integration into
the LHS.
The AC specific aims are:
Aim 1: To provide overall leadership for the Dartmouth LHS E-STaR Center by establishing processes for: a)
governance and management, b) scientist recruitment and project selection, and c) ensuring effective
community engagement with community and stakeholder partners through collaboration with the DH Center for
Advancing Rural Health Equity.
Aim 2: To promote effective communication across the Center and with regional and national LHS communities
through regular communication via: a) a Center web platform, b) regular meeting and reporting schedules, and
c) a LHS Learning Collaborative with a quarterly national webinar addressing issues of healthcare access for
rural populations.
Aim 3: To measure the Center’s ongoing progress through regular evaluation and reporting of metrics for
success across each of the Center’s components and the Center’s overall impact on increasing timely access
to healthcare.
 Through the AC, the Center PIs and research administrative staff will work together to create an inclusive
environment of trust and shared accountability. Collectively, all involved will coproduce evidence-based
solutions for advancing rural health equity while training the next generation of LHS scientists in PCOR/CER
methodologies and LHS competencies."
10818800,"PROJECT ABSTRACT: RESEARCH EDUCATION CORE
 The primary objective of the Research Education Core (REC) is to support the Dartmouth Learning Health
System (LHS) Embedded Scientist Training and Research (E-STaR) Center by providing LHS scientists with a
tailored program of learning to support the conduct of patient-centered outcomes research (PCOR) and
comparative effectiveness research (CER) within a LHS context. This begins with intentional recruitment and
selection of a diverse group of scientists through a national call for applicants whose research interests are
aligned with advancing rural health equity. Understanding candidates’ research skills and experience working
within clinical settings will be essential to crafting the best educational pathway and selecting the most
appropriate mentorship team. The Center has a deep pool of mentors to draw upon, and faculty with years of
experience in PCOR/CER and LHS. All scientist’s training will begin with the Partnership Academy, two-day,
experiential training on community engagement in rural health equity for medically underserved populations.
An assessment of scientists’ knowledge and skills as they pertain to LHS competencies and PCOR/CER
methodologies will guide creation of a tailored training plan to be carried out over 18 months. This will include
selected didactic content, a LHS seminar series, experiential learning involving a research project supported by
the Research and Data Analysis Core (RDAC), and participation in a Learning Collaborative.
 The REC’s Specific Aims are:
Aim 1: To intentionally recruit and guide a diverse cohort of embedded scientists.
Aim 2: To develop and evaluate a training program that delivers needs-based, tailored professional
development plans based on LHS core competencies and PCORI methodology standards for LHS scientists.
Aim 3: To create a community of practice that will support scientists as they develop their research,
improvement, and implementation skills with cross-team experiential immersion in ongoing LHS development.
 The REC, working in concert with the RDAC and the Center’s Administrative Core, will train the next
generation of LHS scientists with essential knowledge for conducting rigorous and reproducible PCOR/CER

10818801,"PROJECT ABSTRACT: RESEARCH AND DATA ANALYSIS CORE
 The primary objective of the Research Data and Analysis Core (RDAC) is to support the Dartmouth Learning
Health System (LHS) Embedded Scientist Training and Research (E-STaR) Center and LHS scientists in
conducting patient-centered outcomes research (PCOR) and comparative effectiveness research (CER), and
in disseminating and implementing PCOR/CER evidence within the LHS.
 The ability to efficiently achieve this objective builds on an existing system of interconnected institutional
resources and our cumulative experience within the Dartmouth Health (DH) LHS. These include a variety of
centers and cores across Dartmouth College and DH supporting research design, study coordination,
informatics and analytic methods, as well as dissemination and implementation of research findings at DH and
other health systems. The RDAC includes a skilled team of experts who will harness the resources of DC and
DH to (a) support the design and conduct of PCOR/CER, (b) share knowledge gained from PCOR/CER
projects, and (c) provide targeted support to implement findings into routine practice.
 The specific aims of the RDAC are:
Aim 1: To support the development of embedded LHS scientists in conducting PCOR/CER projects according
to existing guidelines and standards by providing expertise in: (a) design for observational, interventional,
implementation, and qualitative studies; and (b) statistical and biomedical informatics, including the
development of novel methods addressing specific PCOR/CER issues identified within the supported projects.
Aim 2: For embedded LHS scientists’ PCOR/CER projects, to provide access to administrative claims data
from Medicare, Medicaid, and internal and external healthcare registries; as well as primary data collection
processes; and to develop embedded electronic health record (EHR) research tools and interventions,
including decision support analytics and visualization tools for use by patients and providers.
Aim 3: To facilitate the implementation of effective practices identified into routine care pathways and clinical
practice within and beyond the DH LHS, by: (a) supporting high quality peer-reviewed scientific publications,
(b) creating a curated repository of E-STaR projects to identify and catalogue scientific findings alongside
implementation barriers and facilitators, and (c) providing coaching and support in improvement and
implementation methods to enable integration into DH LHS clinical pathways.
 By specifically supporting the design, conduct, analysis, dissemination, and implementation of their research,
the RDAC will provide essential contributions to the development of LHS scientists, their PCOR/CER and the
DH LHS."
10818925,"Johns Hopkins University proposes to create PERLHS: Promoting Embedded Research in a Learning
Health System. We aim to prepare embedded investigators to apply rigorous methods to generate
and disseminate actionable knowledge. In this proposal, we describe our plans to train investigators
in comparative effectiveness research and patient-centered outcomes research (CER/PCOR) in
service to a learning health system (LHS). We will expressly engage three distinct populations of
embedded researchers for training: clinical investigators embedded within the precision-medicine
initiatives of Johns Hopkins, investigators embedded within the operational functions of the Johns
Hopkins Health System, and investigators embedded in entities working to advance population
health across Maryland. Training these diverse investigators gives us the opportunity to extend the
impact of PERLHS outside of the academic institution to other settings that will beneϐit from having
trained embedded researchers.
 Our training model will focus on building these researchers’ CER/PCOR skills by engaging
them in a longitudinal training program modeled after the Leadership Academy of the Armstrong
Institute for Patient Safety and Quality at Johns Hopkins. Our training program will be an 11-month
experience for the scholars during which time they will engage in asynchronous didactic learning,
participate in monthly small-group workshops as a cohort of scholars, and complete a project to
fulϐill a need of their sponsoring entity closely supervised by a PERLHS mentor who will assist with
design, analysis, and access to resources. We will develop an Administrative Core, a Research
Education Core, and a Research Data and Analysis Core to meet the learning needs of the 10
scholars plus one post-doctoral fellow that we will enroll annually. We will evaluate the individual
scholars and conduct a formative program evaluation annually with the help of our diverse advisory
board. We will work towards a sustainable program by the end of the award where the teaching and
mentoring is supported by tuition remission dollars for our faculty and staff, and scholarship funds
for our external learners."
10818926,"The PERLHS Administrative Core (PAC) provides the structures, norms and support for PERLHS to
encourage a shared mission among participants and partners, a facilitative environment, and access
to unique resources with the goal of providing a rich and supportive learning environment for our
scholars. The PAC provides the leadership, coordination and oversight of all PERLHS activities. PAC
will provide a stable infrastructure and capable leaders who will demonstrate effective coordination
skills and strong emotional intelligence. The coordination and oversight activities of the PAC will
include recruitment and selection of scholars, mentorship matching, connection of scholars to
resources, budget management, and other program administration activities. PAC will also be
responsible for facilitating collaboration among the cohort of scholars, the Cores, the funder, other
E-STAR grant recipients as appropriate, and with partnering entities and other stakeholders
including patients, caregivers, and patient and community organizations. To achieve this,
PAC will use frequent and effective communication to assure productive collaboration, in a setting
where all participants feel psychologically safe and respected, with recognition of their unique
backgrounds, talents and contributions. PAC is also responsible for evaluating the processes and
impact of PERLHS. With both formative and summative goals, PAC directors will measure, monitor,
report and interpret the impact of PERLHS. Namely, the PAC leadership will assess speciϐic training
program outcomes such as patient-centeredness of the research products (tools, policies,
publications), and effectiveness of the research dissemination. Additionally, PAC will conduct a
process evaluation to investigate the accomplishment of the speciϐic aims of each Core. Finally, PAC
will assess the reactions, knowledge, skills, attitudes, behaviors, goals accomplishment and
products of individual PERLHS scholars. The PERLHS mixed method evaluation will use
data sources that include survey data, program administrative documentation, and
interviews."
10818927,"The Research Education Core’s (REC) training model is anchored in contemporary adult learning
theory and calls upon our deep experience cultivating scholars who have competing administrative,
clinical, and production demands. The leaders of REC have reϐined an approach that anchors each
embedded scholar with a dedicated mentor, who supports them in the conduct of a carefully
curated embedded research project that is aligned with the needs of the entity that supports their
engagement with PERLHS. The scholar will learn core fundamental skills and develop
individualized specialized expertise in an area most central to the scholar’s work. By enrolling
embedded scholars annually as a cohort of learners, the program ensures engagement and
collegiality. By relying heavily on a ϐlipped-classroom model, the REC insures that the program
works for embedded researchers who have competing demands. By having mentors that provide
intensive biweekly meetings, the REC insures individualization and progress. LHS-based research
requires that multiple disciplines work together to produce the science and to translate its results;
any one individual will not be expert in all LHS competencies. However, the REC will assure that
each learner gains broad foundational knowledge and has the skills to assemble and lead teams of
experts with skills to realize the goals of the LHS. The specialized expertise that each scholar will
pursue will be towards gaining specialty knowledge and skills vital to one portion of the LHS’s
functioning. To achieve these educational goals, after conducting a needs assessment, the directors
of the REC will reϐine the curriculum and processes of PERLHS Academy to include: core and
specialized didactic material, as well as core and specialized experiential learning sessions,
appropriate for the identiϐied needs of the learners. The directors will assure that the PERLHS
scholars create and complete individual learning plans that will allow attainment of the higher-level
CER/PCOR competencies needed for their embedded projects. The directors will closely supervise
the mentoring of the diverse PERLHS scholars as they complete projects in the LHSs in which they
are embedded. We expect that this approach will be particularly impactful given the inclusion of
embedded learners from across the individual- to population-focused entities in which the LHS
concept is essential; the use of tailored lectures and discussions, both asynchronously and in-
person; our tailored experiential learning; and the commitment of diverse mentors from across the
LHS cycle who will work closely with the scholars as they complete their embedded projects."
10818928,"The embedded research project is core to the LHS scholar’s education in PERLHS, and supporting
the research project is the mission of the Research and Data Analytics Core (RDAC). The projects
will vary by where in the learning cycle the scholar chooses to specialize. While the foci differ, the
research cycle within each project is similar: articulate a problem/hypothesis; articulate a protocol;
assemble a team; gain permissions; implement an intervention(s); collect data; analyze data; and
disseminate. The RDAC will support each phase of any type of study, and the PERLHS RDAC has the
resources to do so. The RDAC will assemble the resources needed across a research project’s life
cycle. The RDAC will provide the scholars with coherent and consistent access to the many data and
analytic resources within the Johns Hopkins environment and will help the scholar to apply solid
project management methodology. RDAC will marshal the many rich resources, both human and
computer-based, to support each phase of the scholar’s research project. The RDAC leadership will
work with each scholar to assess his/her needed resources and make the necessary connections
including to data, specialized expertise, and the Biostatistics, Epidemiology, Analytics, and Design
Core. As the scholars complete their work, the RDAC leadership will assist them in depositing their
work into a searchable library of projects, indexed with appropriate metadata. An innovative part of
the RDAC will be to create, identify, catalogue, and facilitate the dissemination, implementation, and
use of scientiϐic information produced by the CER/PCOR projects and to ensure that these research
products join the emerging ecology of computable knowledge resources. Scholars, too, will leave the
program aware of the ecology beyond the local site. At the end of one year, scholars will have
completed successful projects, and will have learned state-of-the-art methods in connecting
research plans to infrastructure. Additionally, they will leave behind a Findable, Accessible,
Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) repository that can help future scholars within and outside of
this institution."

 2 leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma, myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS),
 3 account for 11% of all cancer diagnoses in the US. Chronic hematological cancer (CHC) patients (i.e., chronic
 4 leukemias, low grade lymphomas, myeloma, myelodysplastic syndrome, and myeloproliferative neoplasms
 5 [MPNs]) have extended disease courses that are often different from solid tumor cancers, facing chronic sleep
 6 disturbances often associated with inflammation, fatigue, and emotional distress (anxiety and depression), which
 7 often persist into survivorship. Medications are most commonly prescribed for cancer patients with sleep
 8 disturbance; however, they often come with side effects and risk for long-term dependence. Cognitive behavioral
 9 therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is the most studied and first line of therapy for treating sleep disturbances in cancer
10 patients, but CBT-I is time-consuming, resource-intensive, and not easily accessible for all cancer patients. There
11 is a need for long-term, accessible, non-pharmacologic interventions targeting sleep in CHC patients.
12 Meditation is a safe and effective non-pharmacologic approach for improving a range of cancer-related
13 symptoms. However, meditation interventions have typically been delivered in-person, limiting uptake and
14 widespread dissemination due to patient-reported barriers. Smartphone applications (apps) are a novel
15 intervention approach for delivering meditation and address cancer patients’ barriers to participating in in-person
16 interventions (i.e., fatigue, pain, transportation, and scheduling difficulties) without the time and expertise
17 limitations of CBT-I and side effect risks from medication. Calm is a popular and highly reviewed consumer-
18 based smartphone app that provides an innovative, accessible and scalable platform through which to deliver
19 meditation to CHC patients.
20 We propose a double-blind RCT to determine the effectiveness of an eight-week “app-based wellness”
21 intervention (i.e., active daily meditation intervention [Calm] or the placebo health education podcast control
22 group [POD]) to reduce sleep disturbance (primary outcome), markers of inflammation (TNF-a, IL-6, IL-8, and
23 CRP) fatigue, and emotional distress (anxiety, depression) (secondary outcomes) in CHC patients.
24 Assessments will occur at baseline, post-intervention (eight weeks from baseline), and follow-up (20 weeks from
25 baseline). Participants (N=276) will be randomized to an intervention (10 min/day Calm meditation) (n=138) or
26 control (10 min/day health education podcast) group (n=138). We will remotely collect blood samples for
27 biomarker measurement. This study will fill a knowledge and rigor gap regarding the delivery of smartphone-
28 based meditation as an intervention for sleep and provide new data on sustained effects in CHC patients to
29 reduce sleep disturbance."
10808056,"Project Summary
Ludwig van Beethoven poignantly expressed the perceptual and social burden of hearing loss in an 1801 letter
to a friend stating, “But that jealous demon, my wretched health, has put a nasty spoke in my wheel…for the last
three years my hearing has become weaker and weaker. My ears continue to hum and buzz day and night.
Sometimes I can scarcely hear a person who speaks softly…but if anyone shouts I can’t bear it. Heaven alone
knows what is to become of me.” Beethoven’s self-described maladies can be identified as tinnitus, threshold
shift and hyperacusis, respectively. Hyperacusis presents as two distinct neurological disorders: i) “noxicusis”,
in the form of excruciating sound-triggered ear pain or ii) a generalized auditory hypersensitivity that makes even
moderately intense sounds seem uncomfortably loud. The neurobiological causes of this second, more common,
type of hyperacusis have yet to be defined. This project will develop a mouse model of noise-induced hearing
loss to reveal neural circuit changes that cause auditory perceptual hypersensitivity. Studies pursuant to Aim 1
will develop a suite of head-fixed operant behavioral assays to track the emergence of perceptual hypersensitivity
following noise-induced high-frequency hearing loss. Studies in Aim 2 will use chronic 2-photon calcium imaging
of genetically targeted excitatory and inhibitory neurons in auditory cortex to pinpoint the emergence of cortical
hyperactivity relative to perceptual hypersensitivity. Complementary single unit electrophysiology studies will
contrast cortical hyperexcitability elicited with acoustic stimuli versus optogenetic stimuli that bypass the ear and
brainstem to directly activate neurons in the auditory thalamus. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that auditory cortex
hyperexcitability is necessary and sufficient for auditory perceptual hypersensitivity by expressing stabilized step
function opsins to temporarily induce or reverse cortical hyperexcitability independent of hearing loss. Studies in
Aim 4 will address the distributed downstream effects of excess central gain by tracking the emergence of noise-
induced hyperexcitability in descending cortical efferents as well as local cell bodies in the amygdala and dorsal
cortex of the inferior colliculus. By tracking the precise chronology of hyperexcitability within and beyond the
auditory pathway alongside sound-triggered defensive behaviors such as freezing, it will be possible to identify
a direct link between sensory plasticity and disorders of anxiety and stress that are commonly observed in
individuals with hyperacusis. This association can be causally tested by inducing or reversing cortical
hyperexcitability and noting a potential reversal in subcortical makers of excess loudness growth. Taken
together, this proposal will leverage modern neuroscience tools to perform causal hypothesis testing on neural
circuit changes that underlie a common hearing disorder. Sensory hypersensitivity is also a core phenotype of
migraine as well as neurodevelopmental disorders including Autism and Fragile X syndrome. Identifying the
biological signatures of over-powered cortical amplification would open up new treatment strategies, with far-
ranging implications for hearing impairment and other related neurological disorders."
10808080,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an aging-related neurodegenerative disorder that affects ~5.8 million people in the
United States. Despite intensive research efforts in recent decades, neither an effective palliative treatment nor
a cure is available, largely due to our limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms that are disrupted in
this devastating disease. Current research suggests that the gradual cognitive decline in AD occurs by the
concurrent deleterious action of soluble amyloid-beta (Aβ) oligomers (AβOs) and intracellular tau in the brain.
Emerging evidence, however, suggests that development of AD may also be attributed to a progressive
deterioration of mitochondrial functioning in brain cells, especially neurons. Besides, AD development has
recently been linked to a progressive impairment in brain’s ability to respond to hormones such as insulin—a
condition known as brain insulin resistance. To investigate these emerging but still elusive molecular
mechanisms of AD, we ask the question: is there any connection between AβOs accumulation, tau,
compromised mitochondrial energy metabolism, and increased insulin resistance in the AD brain and if so, how?
It is known that AβOs interact with the neuronal plasma membrane, which may interrupt communications
between neurons and their environment and disrupt their normal functions. We are particularly interested in how
the AβOs disrupts neuron’s ability to properly respond to the presence of insulin or nutrients and how it affects
ATP production and other mitochondrial functions. Along this direction, we recently discovered Nutrient-Induced
Mitochondrial Activity (NiMA), a novel communication pathway between the lysosome and mitochondria, which
is mediated by the lysosome-associated mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Interestingly,
the abnormal accumulation of AβOs in AD cellular models disrupted NiMA in a tau-dependent manner. In this
project, we aim to elucidate molecular mechanisms mediating NiMA and to understand how this pathway is
disrupted by AβOs and tau in AD, by screening regulator of this pathway in human neurons in culture and using
two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy and state-of-the-art mitochondrial and metabolic imaging
of the mouse brain in vivo. Successful completion of this project not only will advance our understanding of these
earliest steps occurred in AD progression, but also may lead to new therapeutic strategies that could help us
cure this disease."
10800863,"Humoral immune memory is critical for vaccine efficacy and to prevent reinfection. Conversely, dysregulation
of humoral immune memory is a likely culprit in autoimmunity and aging. A critical component of humoral im-
munity is the memory B cell (MBC). MBC generate more robust responses upon pathogen re-exposure, as
well as adapt to mutation-driven shifts in pathogen antigenicity. MBC are challenging to study, as Ag-specific
MBC specific to given immunogens are often quite rare, and therefore hard to track. Yet, to examine intrinsic
changes in MBC, it is important to compare naïve Ag-specific precursors (NBC) to their MBC progeny, control-
ling for cell numbers, which requires specially engineered systems. To surmount these challenges, in previous
cycles of this program, we have created tools and systems to make larger numbers of MBC, ways to track
these cells, and developed transfer systems to test function in vivo as well as engineered genetic strategies to
target MBC and their precursors. Using these tools, we discovered and characterized MBC subsets that have
divergent functions. We have further investigated when and where MBC subsets are formed, delineated differ-
entially expressed genes among NBC and MBC subsets; and, most recently, comprehensively described dif-
ferentially-expressed surface markers in both murine and human MBC. In the current proposal, we leverage
these model systems to investigate the processes that govern MBC generation, the molecular and epigenetic
circuits that control distinct memory B cell states, and the types and functioning of MBC that are made after
repeated antigen exposures. In this regard, we have exciting preliminary data that elucidate the major epige-
netic differences between NBC and MBC and their subsets. We hypothesize that such differential chromatin
imprinting occurs during the precursor activation phase. In Aim 1 we will test this hypothesis, developing ge-
nome-wide epigenetic and associated gene expression maps that will define B cell epigenetic memory and will
also implicate TFs that are important for establishing such networks. In Aim 2, we will systematically investi-
gate a set of prioritized candidate TFs, using inducible Cre mice developed in our lab as well as available
floxed alleles. We will determine the effect of loss of these TFs on both development of key MBC subsets as
well as on their function. Our recent data show that a stem-like MBC subset can undergo exhaustion, and then
fail to regenerate sufficient new stem-like cells. This observation has important implications for humans—
where recurrent pathogen exposure and vaccination are common—and could inform vaccine approaches as
well as partly underlie the original antigenic sin phenomenon. In Aim 3 we will investigate these issues using a
powerful system in which MBC are tracked through multiple cycles of immunization. These Aims address cen-
tral problems in the field—with important translational implications—that we are in a unique position to address.
The work we propose will help define the cell-intrinsic “essence” of B cell memory, with important implications
for vaccine design and our fundamental understanding of the immune state."
10801018,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive and molecularly heterogeneous subtype of breast cancer
that frequently exhibits resistance to chemotherapy leading to poorer clinical outcomes. African American (AA)
women in the United States not only suffer from higher incidence rates of TNBC as compared to their European
American (EA) counterparts, but they also endure poorer survival outcomes. Racial disparities in TNBC
outcomes are multifactorial and not fully explained by treatment variations and socioeconomical inequalities. As
such, investigations into how the pathophysiology of TNBC differs between AA and EA women may offer new
insights into the manner through which biologic and socio-demographic factors converge in creating outcome
disparities in TNBC. By sequencing the transcriptomes of primary TNBC tumors obtained from 3 independent
patient cohorts, we detected aberrant activation of MIZ1 in ~70% of AA tumors, an event that was strongly
associated with poorer overall survival solely in AA patients. Based on these and other compelling findings, we
hypothesize that (i) MIZ1 activation underlies disparate outcomes and poor overall survival rates of AA women,
and (ii) targeting mechanistic vulnerabilities in MIZ1 signaling will provide for novel therapeutic approaches to
significantly improve AA TNBC outcomes. To test this hypothesis and to elucidate the molecular mechanisms
whereby MIZ1 governs TNBC aggressiveness in AA patients, we endeavor to perform the following Specific
Aims: (1) determine the mechanisms whereby MIZ1 drives AA tumorigenicity; (2) determine the mechanisms
whereby MIZ1 impacts cellular heterogeneity and macrophage polarization of AA TNBC tumors; and (3)
determine the association of African ancestry with MIZ1 activation in AA TNBC and define the role of this event
in TNBC progression. This project marks the first effort to harness mechanistic vulnerabilities in MIZ1 activation
and function to improve clinical outcomes of AA TNBC patients. Collectively, our innovative concept is highly
impactful and could potentially redefine the clinical practice of treating AA TNBC patients, doing so by developing
novel biomarkers, new drugs, and drug targets to improve clinical outcomes of AA TNBC patients."

Each of the twelve NIAID funded Regional Biocontainment Laboratories (RBLs) have
distinguishing and complementary research capabilities to advance infectious disease and
biodefense research. George Mason University’s (GMU)’s RBL, also known as the Biomedical
Research Laboratory (BRL) has focused on the integration and development of organ-on-a-chip
(OOC) models in containment to bridge in vitro and animal model testing for therapeutics and
vaccine product screening and evaluation. Furthermore, GMU has a comprehensive suite of
advanced research instrumentation to support BSL-3 pathogen and select agent aerosol
exposures in small animals as well as organ, tissue, and molecular level analysis of challenge
studies. These capabilities in containment are complemented by GMU’s expertise in
proteomics, metabolomics, and nanotechnology as well as a track record of developing platform
technologies that have transitioned from the bench to market.
The proposed Biocontainment Research Support Services Core at GMU will include 1) a
Microphysiological systems (MPS) core and 2) an Advanced Animal Research (AAR) core.
The MPS platforms will represent at least nine different organ systems with representation by
relevant human-derived cell types for at least twelve priority viral and bacterial pathogens.
Accompanying assays including the limit of detection for pathogen quantification, inflammatory
burden, and organ damage in the context of infection will be developed for each model.
Additional high throughput organ-on-a-chip (OOC) and organoid platforms integrated in the core
will provide added functionality, validation of results through multiple platforms, and accelerated
discovery. The AAR core will integrate a comprehensive set of state-of-the-art technologies and
infectious disease expertise to accelerate countermeasure development through cutting-edge
approaches for lead optimization, dosing, toxicity screens, safety assessment, efficacy, immune
modulation, and biodistribution.
The cores will be staffed with research scientists in the BRL to support internal investigators and
serve as a resource for the RBL network and partners from pharmaceutical and biotechnology
companies; federal, state, and local agencies; and academic institutions conducting infectious
disease and biodefense research and countermeasure development."

Our goal is to develop in vivo imaging of microtubules
using our novel PET probes, at all stages of AD progression. Thus we propose 3 Specific Aims based on our
strong preliminary data. In Aim 1, we will determine the relationship between microtubule integrity and amyloid
β pathology by performing longitudinal microPET/CT imaging of microtubules with [11C]MPC-6827 and amyloid
β imaging with [11C]PiB in two murine models of AD. In Aim 2, we will quantify and characterize microtubule
uptake in brains of the same murine models of AD using [3H]/[11C]MPC-6827. We will perform ex vivo
biodistribution, in vitro autoradiography and histopathological assays to correlate microtubule density with
routine neurobiomarkers. In Aim 3, we will determine and establish dependency of microtubule imaging uptake
to amyloid β and/or tau levels after therapeutic interventions. We will perform microPET/CT images in the
same two murine models of AD, before, during and after the standard treatment protocols with potential
therapeutic agents reducing amyloid β and/or tau levels. In this project, led by an Early Stage Investigator, we
hypothesize that we can expand the microtubule scaffold as potential in vivo imaging agents, not only to
diagnose AD at an early stage, but also follow the therapeutic utility of the treatments. The PET imaging data
generated could be a valuable tool for clinicians to assess AD in several stages of progression and treatment.
This project is the first to propose the imaging of microtubules in vivo in AD. If successful, this work will provide
a new paradigm to directly probe microtubules in vivo in real time. Our work could markedly enhance precision
medicine approaches for treatment of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases."

 Retinal ischemia is a major cause of vision loss in common retinal disease conditions including diabetic
retinopathy, glaucoma, retinopathy of prematurity, and vein occlusion. This project aims to define the
mechanisms of retinal ischemic injury and identify new therapeutic targets.
 My long-term career goal is to pursue a distinguished career in vision research and academia. I will
achieve this through establishing a strong independent research program in an academic institution that
promotes interdisciplinary biomedical science and translational research. My short-term goal is to attain intensive
training and supervised career development skills that are required for my career transition to become an
independent investigator. Securing this award will provide me with the necessary training to achieve my short-
term goals and will be the first step towards independence and achieving my long-term goals.
 My mentor's lab has demonstrated the involvement of the arginase enzyme in retinal neurovascular
diseases. Arginase has two isoforms. Building upon the lab's finding that the mitochondrial isoform, arginase 2
(A2), has a deleterious role in retinal ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury, I developed a project focusing on the
neurovascular protective role of the cytosolic isoform arginase 1 (A1). My recently published paper shows a
neuroprotective role of A1 expression in myeloid cells. Arginase competes with nitric oxide synthase (NOS) for
their common substrate L-arginine. Nitric oxide (NO) produced by inducible NOS (iNOS) causes neurovascular
degeneration. I predict that A1 upregulation in myeloid cells limits iNOS-derived nitrative and oxidative stress
and reduces inflammation through its downstream metabolites ornithine and putrescine. Putrescine is the
precursor of polyamines and it is formed from ornithine by ornithine decarboxylase (ODC, the rate-limiting
enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis). These metabolites have been shown to promote reparative myeloid cells
through chromatin modification. In line with this, my preliminary data show that histone deacetylase (HDAC) 3 is
increased in the absence of A1 in both IR-injured retinas and stimulated macrophages. HDAC3 is essential for
macrophage inflammatory gene transcription and it has been shown to suppress A1 expression. Herein, I
propose a novel suppressive effect of A1 on HDAC3. My central hypothesis predicts that myeloid A1 protects
against retinal IR injury through ODC-mediated suppression of HDAC3. I will be using mice with myeloid-specific
deletion of A1, ODC and HDAC3, as well as the investigational drug, BCT-100 (a PEGylated form of arginase
1), together with primary macrophages isolation and treatment with inhibitors for HDAC3 or arginase downstream
enzyme, ODC. My goal is to achieve the following objectives: A) Determine the effect of manipulating the
arginase pathway on myeloid cells infiltration / activation in retinal IR injury and the therapeutic potential of BCT-
100. B) Describe the cross talk between the arginase pathway and HDAC3 and determine whether A1 in myeloid
cells mediates its protective effect through suppression of HDAC3."

10792869,"Advanced Glycan End Products (AGEs) are toxic and highly reactive dicarbonyl molecules
produced by most life on earth from routine metabolic processes. As such, conserved and
dedicated detoxifying systems have emerged for dicarbonyl removal. Owing to their importance,
these removal systems are required to maintain longevity, thereby emphasizing the importance
of dicarbonyl detoxification in maintaining health. One of the most prominent dicarbonyl species
is glyoxal, which is predominantly produced as a byproduct of glycolysis. Glyoxal acts by
mounting specific attacks on certain amino acids, namely arginines, cysteines, histidines and
lysines in key proteins, thereby adversely altering protein function. In humans, these
modifications can result in many diseased states, including: cancer, diabetes, nervous system
disorders, heart disease, hypertension, atherosclerosis and aging. Unfortunately, although
dicarbonyl stress-related toxicity is now regarded as important as oxidative stress, knowledge
about how cells are able to detect and respond to glyoxal buildup is, by comparison, severely
lacking. Our lab has discovered a novel class of Antibiotic Monooxygenase (ABM) domains that
we hypothesize sense and respond to glyoxal and related dicarbonyls from bacteria to humans.
This project proposes to elucidate the mechanism by which one of these ABM domains, we
named Glyoxal-ABM Domain 1 (GAD1) responds to glyoxal in the bacterial pathogen
Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We have thus far shown that GAD1 from P. aeruginosa, which is co-
transcribed with the glyoxal detoxification enzyme GloA2, binds heme directly and is also
covalently modified by glyoxal on a conserved arginine residue (Arg49). We hypothesize that
GAD1 and its many homologs are specifically modified on conserved residues, which, in turn,
signals to switch cellular metabolic flux away from glycolysis other pathways unable to produce
the glyoxal toxin. Our studies here will Aim to (1) map GAD1 regulation, (2) determine its cellular
distribution and its interactome and (3) solve the structures of its apo and holo forms, and in
complex with interacting partners in P. aeruginosa. Studying GAD1 in P. aeruginosa is expected
to reveal novel pathways that have potential as new antimicrobial targets, and at the same time
advance our basic understanding of glyoxal toxicity sensing in humans and other multicellular
organisms."
10792870,"Project Summary:
Macrophages are key effector cells of the immune system, with critical functions in killing of microbes,
production of inflammatory regulators, and tissue repair. However, an excessive macrophage response
contributes to the pathology of cancer as well as inflammatory and degenerative diseases. In addition,
unchecked proliferation of macrophage precursors in lieu of differentiation leads to acute myeloid leukemia. To
better address how to modulate macrophage function to help abate diseases that involve changes in
macrophage biology, we must understand the critical molecular pathways that govern macrophage
differentiation and regulate their activity.
We propose that one of these pathways will involve mRNA polyadenylation, an essential maturation step in
which mRNA precursor is trimmed at its 3' end and a poly(A) tail (pA) added. Changing the position of the pA
site through a process called alternative polyadenylation (APA) plays an important, increasingly appreciated
role in regulation of gene expression. Shortening of the 3' untranslated region can remove regulatory
sequences that control RNA stability, translation, and subcellular localization, whereas coding region
shortening can dramatically alter protein function. While global changes in APA have been observed in tumor
progression and other types of cellular differentiation, the contribution of APA to macrophage differentiation
has not been studied.
We hypothesize that a global shift in APA is required for macrophage differentiation and that this shift is
driven by changing levels of APA regulators. Our objective is to determine how APA contributes to
macrophage differentiation, with the long-range goal of defining how this might be manipulated in therapeutic
settings to promote differentiation and modulate macrophage function. Our specific aims will 1) determine the
global pattern of APA during macrophage differentiation, the functional classes of genes impacted by APA,
and sequence features that might characterize these sites, 2) define drivers of macrophage APA and the
consequence that altering their expression has on differentiation as well as well-characterized macrophage
functions such as cytokine production, migration, and phagocytosis, and 3) determine the molecular
mechanisms that alter the levels of the proteins that regulate APA. Because macrophage are a first line of
defense for many diseases and dysregulation of their differentiation leads to leukemias, our proposed studies
should ultimately inform new therapeutic tools to modulate macrophage production. They will also broadly
advance our understanding of general and tissue-specific APA paradigms. s"

 In modern biological research, computing has become an integral component in Biological
Big Data (BBD) analysis, yet education in computing has not been fully incorporated into life
science education: many biologists are given a diluted treatment of computational genomics that
presents the methods central to the field as nothing more than a toolkit. ​The pedagogical
challenge facing the development of a computational genomics curriculum is the need to convey
the important ideas ​without assuming previous exposure to programming. Biologists would also
profit from knowing how to effectively apply various existing genomics software tools and, at the
same time, ​understand how these tools work, a condition that is often violated in existing
courses.
 We believe that high-quality online computational genomics education offers a particularly
attractive solution to the problem because many universities have failed to address this
challenge. It offers a promising pedagogical innovation because it is not ​replacing anything, but
rather is fulfilling an important need. It bypasses the need for extensive curricular reform at the
level of individual universities and instead adapt to high-quality, open online resources that
lower the cost per student. We believe that our proposed online ​Computational Genomics
Specialization will contribute to various offline courses (e.g., by enabling a flipped course) that
will be developed in response to the same NIH Funding Opportunity Announcement “Initiative to
Maximize Research Education in Genomics.”
 We have published popular bioinformatics and algorithms textbooks, ​have published papers
on various challenges of education in computational biology in reputable journals, delivered a
TEDx talk on online education, founded a conference specializing in bioinformatics education
(RECOMB-BE), developed multiple successful MOOCs in bioinformatics (including the first
bioinformatics MOOC), and advised the development of Rosalind, an open online platform for
learning bioinformatics through problem solving that has been used by over 100 professors.
 Our goals are (1) to develop open, modular, extendable, and adaptable MOOCs covering a
broad range of topics in modern computational genomics, (2) use the developed MOOCs to
competitively recruit the participants into the proposed offline computational genomics short
courses and to bring underrepresented minorities to these events, and (3) establish ​the
Computational Genomics Education Alliance, a community of educators who will help develop
open, high-quality, modular online content and serve as instructors at our annual courses."
10790561,"ABSTRACT
Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACT) have been the bedrock of malaria treatment in Africa for more
than a decade, spurring remarkable gains in malaria control, even as parasites tolerant to commonly used ACT
partner drugs continue to circulate. In East Africa, parasites harboring mutations associated with resistance to
the partner drug lumefantrine are selected through treatment and responsible for the majority of recurrent
infections that arise starting 3-4 weeks following ACT. These post-treatment parasitemias likely contribute to
the onward transmission of drug-resistant parasites to mosquitoes and further spread of antimalarial
resistance. Now, parasites with partial artemisinin resistance that have emerged in Rwanda are spilling over
into northwest Tanzania, a high malaria burden country, where 4% of the world’s malaria deaths occur.
Mitigating the spread of ACT-resistant parasites across sub-Saharan Africa will require a better understanding
of the transmission reservoir (who is transmitting drug-resistant parasites to mosquitoes) and ways to intervene
to interrupt this transmission. While ACT and single low dose primaquine effectively clear those presenting with
gametocytes, the parasite stages essential for transmission to mosquitoes, no current strategies target
gametocytes that arise in the weeks following treatment. We hypothesize that gametocytes associated with
post-ACT parasitemia are transmissible to mosquitoes and contribute to the spread of antimalarial resistance,
even as most go undetected. This R21 proposal will determine the risk of transmission from PCR-positive
individuals one month following ACT (Aim 1) and find whether drug resistant alleles that are selected during
treatment are maintained through transmission (Aim 2). To accomplish these aims, we will leverage the
capacity we have built over the last 5 years to characterize the infectious reservoir in Bagamoyo, Tanzania,
where we have performed >600 mosquito feeding assays in asymptomatic parasite carriers, most with
subpatent infection only detectable by PCR. Our team will screen >300 persons participating in a large triple
ACT trial for recurrent parasitemia during weeks 3-8 of follow-up and conduct mosquito membrane feeding
assays to measure their transmissibility to Anopheles gambiae and A. funestus, the primary malaria vectors in
East Africa. We will sequence transmitted parasites that survive to the salivary gland sporozoite stage within
mosquitoes and compare the frequency of key drug resistance alleles in these mosquitoes to blood collected
from persons pre and post-treatment. We expect that the post-treatment period, 4-8 weeks after first-line ACT
therapy, is indeed a vulnerable time for gametocytemia to arise without symptoms, and lead to transmission of
P. falciparum parasites bearing kelch 13 and mdr1 mutations selected through treatment. However, we also
expect that triple ACT therapies that reduce the rate of post-treatment parasitemia will be effective in
preventing onward transmission of drug-resistant parasites. Findings from our study will inform the design of
strategies that mitigate the spread of ACT resistance, buying time for new antimalarials to be rolled out."
10793729,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
A critical function of the nervous system is to rapidly process sensory information and initiate appropriate behavioral
responses. Defects in sensory processing and behavior selection are commonly observed in neuro-psychiatric conditions
including anxiety, autism (ASD), and schizophrenia (SZ). Despite the biological and clinical relevance, our understanding
of the cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating these processes is limited, in part due to the intricate and dynamic
circuitry involved in complex human decision-making. The etiology of sensory processing disorders remains equivocal;
however, it is hypothesized that intrinsic/genetic, extrinsic/environmental and the interactions of intrinsic and extrinsic
factors can play fundamental roles. Understanding the genetic components of environmental triggered response is critical
in understanding the overall impact of the environment on organisms, including humans. Many environmental changes
show differential response within populations of individuals due to genetic differences in the affected pathways. In parallel,
many environmental pollutants have a range of adverse neuro-health outcomes and despite increasing recognition of the
importance of evaluating neurotoxicity in safety assessment, tens of thousands of commercial chemicals in current use, have
not been evaluated. In this R21 proposal we investigate how gene by environmental interactions (GxE) impact
developmental neurotoxicity linked to sensory processing deficits and neuro-psychiatric conditions later in life. We utilize
the Medaka Inbred Kiyosu-Karlsruhe (MIKK) Panel to test the hypothesis that there are common pathways of
environmental contaminant response across vertebrates, and that the majority of these pathways have segregating
genetic variation contributing to polygenic GxE effects of contaminant responses. The MIKK panel consists of 80 near-
isogenic inbred lines, currently inbred for 22 generations, with fully sequenced genomes and transcriptome. Both molecular
and organismal phenotypes are distinguishable, and molecular traits can be mapped to specific loci. We propose that the
MIKK panel will provide unique insights into GxE components of developmental neurotoxicity and sensory processing
behaviors related to neuropsychiatric conditions. Advances in developmental toxicity studies using zebrafish and medaka,
key biomedical model species, have provided insights using larval behavioral studies. The high relative fecundity of teleost
models, as compared to mice, as well as the regulatory advantages to using an earlier-diverging vertebrate (reducing the use
of animals in research) provides additional incentives to developing these methods. The MIKK panel provides a key resource
with the isogenic strains necessary to characterize the genomic contributions to environmental effects with important
implications for sensitive human populations."

Listening effort and fatigue have serious impacts on quality of life for individuals with hearing loss. As the
clinical importance of listening effort becomes more widely acknowledged, there is an increased urgency to
improve our understanding of effort and fatigue in contexts relevant to real-world communication. One factor
that has the potential to alleviate effort and fatigue in everyday listening is the ability to see a conversation
partner’s face. While visual speech cues are known to improve speech intelligibility — particularly for listeners
with hearing loss — the link between visual speech and listening effort has not been established. Translating
the perceptual benefits of seeing a talker’s face to real listening further hinges on moving beyond video-based,
non-interactive contexts and investigating how listeners use visual speech cues during social communication.
The goals of this project are twofold. First, we will determine how and when seeing a talker’s face alleviates
effort and fatigue for listeners with cochlear implants (CIs), focusing on cognitively and perceptually demanding
listening scenarios. Second, we will examine eye gaze behavior during live conversations: how social
interaction changes where on the face listeners tend to look, how these patterns differ for listeners with CIs
(who likely rely more on visual cues from the talker’s mouth), and how individual differences in gaze behavior
relate to the effort of speech perception during conversation. Results will improve our understanding of
audiovisual speech perception and effort during natural communication, laying the groundwork for future
studies on how listeners with CIs use visual speech to improve the perception of prosody and track multi-talker
conversations. This work will inform the development of diagnostic testing to assess multisensory speech
perception, as well as rehabilitation strategies to maximize audiovisual benefits for individuals with hearing
and/or vision loss."

The central KRAS-ERK signaling axis is activated in most human pancreatic adenocarcinomas (PDAC).
Attempts to target ERK1 and ERK2 signaling with non-selective kinase inhibitors have produced only limited
efficacy in the clinic at the cost of dose-limiting toxicity. Our breakthrough discovery for this proposal is that
ERK2, and not ERK1, is an essential driver of pancreatic carcinogenesis but is dispensable in non-transformed
pancreatic epithelial cells. Based on this, ERK2 represents a new potent target for therapeutic intervention in
PDAC. This proposal is built on the results of our recent studies of genetic models of myeloid neoplasms in which
we have established ERK2 as a central oncogenic effector via its unique substrate interaction domains. In our
ERK2 knock-in mouse genetic models, the D domain of ERK2 promotes cancer progression, while the ERK2
DBP domain opposes progression and induces senescence in oncogene-transformed cells. However, the role
of the ERK2-D and DBP domains in driving KRAS-initiated PDAC tumorigenesis has not been investigated.
Hence, our central hypothesis is that pancreatic carcinogenesis driven by mutant KRAS is dependent on domain-
specific functions of ERK2. We propose the following aims:
Aim 1. To assess the opposing functions of the ERK2-D and DBP domains in pancreatic carcinogenesis. Our
preliminary results indicate that conditional deletion of ERK2 (Mapk1 gene) in the KPC model dramatically
impedes PDAC development. We will intercross KPC mice in which the wild type Mapk1 gene is replaced with
the D- and DBP-domain mutants (knock-in models already available in our lab) to pinpoint which of substrate
binding pockets is critical for pancreatic cancer development and progression.
Aim 2. Determine the mechanistic basis by which the ERK2-D and DBP domains exert their distinct functions.
We will generate in vitro models of ERK2 deletion and replacement with D- and DBP-domains mutations by RNAi
and CRISPR-targeting of ERK2 in PDAC cell lines and assess the effects on cell growth, and MAPK pathway
signaling. These models will be essential discovery tools for future proteomic and transcriptome analyses to
pinpoint the ERK2 domains interactors that are essential for exerting the KRAS malignant phenotype and will
allow us to decipher the molecular basis for the opposing functions of ERK2 D and DBP domains.
Through these efforts, we expect to bring new insights into the role of ERK2 substrate binding modules in
regulating pancreatic cancer progression, and how to exploit this information therapeutically."

Primary cilia are microtubule-based sensory structures found on the surface of most eukaryotic cells.
Dysfunctional cilia lead to numerous syndromic disorders, often characterized by renal abnormalities. Unlike
other cellular organelles, the ciliary lumen is open to the cytoplasm, making it unclear how cilia-essential and
renal-physiology-related proteins, such as Polycystin 1 and 2 from ADPKD, reach the cilia. There is growing
evidence to support the existence of a selective gate at cilia base that regulates the import of ciliogenic
proteins. Despite the poorly studied transition fibers (TFs) being implied to be a vital part of the ciliary gate,
there is a lack of molecular insight into the establishment of TFs, either in terms of their structure or function.
 Investigating the connection between cilia and disease in mammalian models can be challenging due to
the essential roles of cilia in mammalian embryonic development. Thus, alternative experimental systems are
needed. Caenorhabditis elegans has proven to be an effective model for studying ciliary proteins in their
natural cellular environment due to its highly conserved cilia composition and signaling. Our laboratory
pioneered the application of C. elegans to study the ciliary gate in past funding periods and made important
discoveries about its composition, establishment, and significance in human diseases. Our recent findings
have shown that the ARPKD protein DZIP1L plays a crucial role in establishing functional cilia gates in both C.
elegans and human renal epithelial cilia. Building on our expertise in cilia research and utilizing the resources
of the Mayo Clinic PKD Translational Center, our main objective is to fundamentally advance the
understanding of the physiological importance of cilia gating in ciliopathies beyond Polycystic Kidney
Disease. This proposal is based on a novel discovery that DZIP1L and ANKRD26 forms a conserved protein
module to recruit other essential TF proteins to build a functional cilia gate; a paradigm that the activity of a
poorly defined phosphoinositide signaling, mediated by the ciliary PIPKg, determines the proper localization of
DZIP1L; and an exciting hypothesis that the ARPKD variants of DZIP1L may specifically impact cilia import of
polycystins. Emerging evidence from our laboratory and others shows that polycystin dosage closely correlate
with the severity of various PKD conditions, highlighting the therapeutic potential of targeting cilia gating to
enhance the import of PKD proteins. To comprehensively understand the regulatory pathways of DZIP1L-
regulated cilia gating, especially for PKD proteins, we will use both C. elegans and mammalian renal cell
models and employ an interdisciplinary approach. Our goal is to gain critical insights into this understudied
area in cilia and ciliopathies, establish its physiological significance, and link fundamental discoveries to the
molecular connections between aberrant cilia gating and the development of PKD disorders."
10932966,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 A key priority for the NIH is to limit disability caused by osteoarthritis (OA) and other chronic diseases that
emerge with age. Senescent cells within joint tissues contribute to OA, but there is a knowledge gap regarding
the triggers by which decades of aging initiate cellular senescence. One key mediator of senescence in other
contexts is persistent DNA damage and the subsequent activation of a set of signaling pathways known as the
DNA damage response (DDR). The DDR can drive the production of inflammatory and matrix-degrading
molecules collectively known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which has strong
overlap with catabolic molecules known to contribute to OA. As demonstrated through the use of a single-cell
gel electrophoresis “comet” assay, chondrocytes accumulate significant levels of DNA damage throughout aging
and during OA. This damage is mostly in the form of single-strand breaks (SSBs) but a subset of cells also
harbor double-strand breaks (DSBs). These distinct forms of damage can be initiated in cells from young
cadaveric donors and mice to mimic the levels found in older donors/mice, with methyl methanesulfonate (MMS)
for SSBs, ellipticine for DSBs, and irradiation to generate both SSBs and DSBs. Conversely, the burden of DNA
damage in older cadaveric donors and older mice can be reduced by boosting DNA repair with activation of
Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) using the small molecule MDL-800. The long-term goal of this work is to catalyze more effective
treatments for OA by determining the mechanisms by which joint cells become senescent. The central
hypothesis is that the accumulation of DNA damage in joint tissues plays a causal role in driving senescence,
the SASP, and subsequent OA. The first aim is to establish the contribution of SSBs and DSBs to senescence
by applying distinct forms of DNA damage (irradiation, MMS, ellipticine) to cadaveric human chondrocytes and
synovial cells. The second aim is to determine the extent to which DNA damage drives senescence and OA in
mice. We also use intra-articular injection of agents to increase damage (MMS or ellipticine) or decrease damage
(MDL-800) in the joints of p16tdTom reporter mice to assess senescence and functional/histologic OA. The third
aim is to define the protein signatures that contribute to progression towards the SASP using a multiplex antibody
staining method known as iterative indirect immunofluorescence imaging (4i) to track the signaling pathways that
are activated in response to DNA damage. The expected outcomes of this work include a better understanding
of the types of DNA damage that lead to senescence in joint tissues and the signaling pathways that link the
DDR to SASP. This work is innovative in that tailored interventions are employed to alter the levels of DNA
damage, with sophisticated readouts of senescence, including 4i for assessing protein signatures and
senescence reporter mice. These contributions are expected to have a positive impact on society by stimulating
more effective strategies to target senescent cells for the prevention and treatment of OA."
10931686,"IL-1α and β were discovered more than 50 years ago, and knowledge about these pleiotropic cytokines has
grown exponentially since that time. Therapeutic use of these molecules has been limited by toxicity, and their
blockade has had limited success in inflammatory disorders. In 2017, the CANTOS trial using canukinumab
and antibody to IL-1β, showed an unexpected association of blocking IL-1β and a dose dependant reduction in
the incidence of cancers, rekindling interest in the role of IL-1’s molecules in tumor immunity. However, our
data thus far suggests unappreciated complexity. We and others have shown that the of blocking IL-1β in
mouse models of cancer, and our published and preliminary data suggest that the mechanism by which anti-
tumor immunity evolves is not straightforward. For example, blocking IL-1β permits immunostimulatory T cell
activation by IL-1α to proceed unopposed, favoring tumor immunity. In parallel, blocking IL-1β’s effects on
myeloid cells modifies the tumor microenvironment independently to favor CD8 T cell mediated anti-cancer
immunity. The immunotherapeutic effects of IL-1α appear to be operating through the CD8 T cell IL-1R1, and
we propose that by understanding this pathway more completely, we can greatly enhance its activity.
Moreover, IL-1R1-driven effects on myeloid cells appear to inhibit anti-cancer immunity in the TME, and we
hypothesize that understanding these effects will allow us to target this pathway with precision. To visualize
these changes histopathologically, we have employed the powerful CyCIF platform. To test hypotheses in
vivo, we will use novel molecules known as AcTakines. These compounds target cytokine activity or blockade
precisely to specific cell types in vivo without systemic toxicity and will help us to dissect these immune
pathways in tumor-bearing animals. Because these drugs are being developed for future use in humans, our
work will serve as a basis for a better mechanistic understanding of their future use in cancer immunotherapy.
We believe this is a new and unexplored pathway through which we can greatly enhance anti-tumor immunity,
contributing fundamentally to immunotherapy of cancer."

 My lab is interested in defining how the maternal load is established during oogenesis and decoded af-
ter fertilization. We know the identity of the most important maternal transcripts and maternally supplied RNA-
binding proteins. We know which factors are required for germline development, oocyte maturation, and pat-
tern formation in early embryogenesis. But we do not yet know which regulatory events are most important for
reproduction, or what mechanisms coordinate regulation in space and time. And we do not yet know how envi-
ronmental factors modulate maternal regulation, or why reproduction is so exquisitely temperature sensitive.
 The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is an exemplary tool for the study of germline development and
reproductive biology. The worm is easy to culture, has a short generation time, and a large brood size. The an-
imal is transparent making visualization of fluorescent reporters in live animals straightforward. RNAi is highly
efficient in this species— pathways exist to take up double stranded RNA (dsRNA) from the environment and
spread it throughout the worm, enabling RNAi by soaking the worms in dsRNA, or by feeding the worms bacte-
ria that express dsRNA, a property that has enabled routine genome-wide RNAi screening. Now, thanks to
CRISPR / Cas9, it is possible to make both targeted gene deletions and targeted gene replacements in C. ele-
gans a relatively straightforward way.
 In preliminary data, we used CRISPR / Cas9 genome editing to make 3´UTR deletions in three critical
maternally supplied genes: glp-1 (Notch), mex-3 (hMEX), and oma-1 (Tis11). All of these genes are highly
conserved from worms to mammals, where they play key roles in specifying cell fates during early embryogen-
esis prior to the onset of zygotic transcription. While the 3´UTRs of glp-1 and mex-3 are necessary and suffi-
cient to pattern their expression in the germline, we discovered to our surprise that neither 3´ UTR is required
for reproduction under standard laboratory conditions. By contrast, the oma-1 3´UTR is absolutely essential,
but only in the absence of a functional copy of the redundant gene oma-2.
 Interestingly, under slightly elevated temperature growth, deletion of the mex-3 3´UTR causes a highly
penetrant maternal effect lethal phenotype. We further show that the 3´UTR is a negative regulator of mex-3
levels in the germline, but a positive regulator in the embryo. The primary role of the mex-3 3´UTR is to buffer
expression under fluctuatating temperature. These data provide the basis for our hypotheses to be tested: 1)
fluctuating temperatures effect the abundance and translation of maternal mRNAs, which may be a major
cause of the temperature sensitivity of reproduction observed throughout the animal kingdom, and 2) that post-
transcriptional regulation of maternal RNAs is necessary for reproductive robustness during stress as opposed
to being an essential requirement for fertility. We will comprehensively test these hypotheses through an inte-
grative, multi-disciplinary approach including molecular genetics, genomics, and mechanistic experiments."
10801283,"Abstract
Heart failure is a complex and heterogeneous clinical syndrome with significant morbidity and mortality
worldwide. Regardless of the heart failure etiology, cardiomyocytes initially develop adaptive morphological
hypertrophy that tends to reduce wall stress and prevent cardiac dysfunction, followed by transition to
maladaptive decompensation that ultimately leads to heart failure. Understanding the transcriptome
reconfiguration during transition can aid in preventing pathologic hypertrophy, the key driver of heart failure.
Recent advances in next-generation sequencing have dramatically expanded the scope of cardiac transcriptome
to non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs). Our preliminary studies discovered a novel miRNA (miR-
128) that is aberrantly upregulated in mouse and human failing hearts. The contributory role of miR-128 toward
heart failure was documented in a pilot study showing that cardiomyocyte-specific miR-128 overexpression in
mice causes eccentric cardiomyocyte hypertrophy with deteriorating cardiac functions. Mechanistically, we found
that the increased miR-128 in failing cardiomyocytes is due to epigenetic changes with hypomethylation of the
enhancer sequence in miR-128, leading to elevated recruitment of upstream transcription factor-1 (USF1) to
enhance miR-128 transcription. Additional mechanistic studies with affinity RNA pull-down followed by mass
spectrometry analysis revealed miR-128 interaction with the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein HNRNPA1.
Moreover, this protein is translocated into the mitochondria during cardiomyocyte failure, thereby also increasing
import of miR-128 into the mitochondria. In the mitochondria, miR-128 interacts with the heavy-strand promoter
(HSP) of mitochondria DNA (mtDNA) to suppress mitochondria DNA transcription thus leading to mitochondria
dysfunction and cardiomyocyte death. Based on these initial findings, we hypothesize that miR-128 inhibition
can reduce or prevent cardiac pathological hypertrophy in response to stress by directly reversing or ameliorating
mitochondria abnormality associated with cardiomyocyte failure. Specifically, we propose that applications of
epigenetic editing system containing sgRNA (targeting to USF1 motif in miR-128 enhancer) and scFv-GCN4-
DNMT3a (methylation of miR-128 enhancer) to silence miR-128 before or during early stages of cardiac
remodeling are effective strategies to alleviate stress-induced cardiac damage and reduce the mortality and
morbidity of heart failure. Three Specific Aims are proposed to test this hypothesis: Aim 1 will identify the
mechanism by which miR-128 contributes to cardiac pathological hypertrophy in mouse and human cellular
models, and evaluate the effects of miR-128 on pathological hypertrophy during cardiac remodeling. Aim 2 will
elucidate the mechanism underlying the impaired mitochondria homeostasis induced by miR-128 and the
trafficking mechanism of miRNA into the mitochondria. Aim 3 will interrogate the epigenetic mechanism of
aberrant miR-128 expression in heart failure, and test the hypothesis that epigenetic silencing of miR-128
enhancer is a viable therapeutic approach to prevent pathological hypertrophy during cardiac remodeling."

Major disparities in breast cancer-related outcomes have been widely documented across the cancer care
continuum, with Black patients experiencing higher mortality and decreased quality of life (QOL) compared to
White patients. Despite compelling evidence that routine patient-reported outcome (PRO) measurement can
improve outcomes and patient experiences in oncology, PRO reporting remains low among Black patients and
within the community cancer care (CCC) setting where they often receive care. The overall goal of this
proposed study is to increase Black breast cancer patient engagement in PRO reporting by establishing
flexible and contextually aligned HIT-assisted PRO implementation models in CCCs serving a high proportion
of Black patients. Completing this work will set the stage to increase routine use of PROs in clinical care to
improve health outcomes and reduce disparities among Black patients. In partnership with the Association of
Community Cancer Centers (ACCC), we will develop models for successful implementation of PRO reporting
in five CCCs in the ACCC network that serve a high proportion of Black cancer patients (Boston Medical
Center, Boston, MA; Baptist Hospital, Memphis TN; Brooklyn Methodist, Brooklyn NY; University of Maryland,
Baltimore, MD; Luminis Health, Lanham, MD). The HIT platform for this study will be imPROVE, an Epic-
integrated PRO platform with automated feedback and resources (AFR) centered around the preferences,
needs and values of Black patients. In line with the priorities of the NCI and NIMHD, we will (Aim 1) identify
challenges, barriers, and enablers to HIT-assisted PRO data collection among Black breast cancer patients
receiving care in CCCs and develop PRO implementation models that address these factors; (Aim 2) conduct
a phased implementation of the PRO data collection models in five CCCs using PDSA cycles to refine models
and the RE-AIM framework to evaluate success; and (Aim 3) explore the potential of detecting disparities in
outcomes based on PRO data used in clinical care to inform future quality improvement efforts. Our expected
outcomes are generalizable knowledge of the factors that trigger or deter Black breast cancer patient
engagement, and models with training materials and tools for feasible, pragmatic, and sustainable PRO
program implementation across the ACCC network. More than 80% of cancer patients nationwide receive their
care at CCCs, and approximately 65% of the nation’s cancer patients are treated by a member of the ACCC
network. The completion of this foundational work, with broad dissemination of lessons learned through the
ACCC and beyond, will unlock the benefits of PRO reporting to historically underserved patients and advance
equitable cancer care. This work will also support a continued program of research to expand implementation
and evaluation of PRO programs among other diverse patient populations in oncology, determine the added
benefit of AFR, and further the use of PRO data for quality improvement."

 The recent advancement of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) enables highly focused dose delivery to
tumors while sparing surrounding normal tissues. Emerging clinical evidence showing superior tumor control
and patient survival suggests that SBRT will play an increasingly critical role in liver tumor management.
However, radiation-induced toxicity, especially of the dose-sensitive normal liver tissues, poses a lingering
challenge to liver radiotherapy and SBRT. Proton therapy, with its unique ‘Bragg peaks’, allows simultaneous
tumor dose escalation and normal tissue sparing, paving the way to boost the efficacy and safety of liver SBRT.
Unfortunately, precisely delivering planned proton doses to liver tumors is significantly challenged by the intra-
treatment liver motion, especially for the increasingly dominant pencil beam scanning (PBS) technique. Current
motion management techniques including abdominal compression, beam re-scanning, and respiratory gating,
however, all suffer from various sources of uncertainties and inaccuracy, resulting in limited and case-
dependent efficacy. Motion tracking, a technique that tracks the real-time tumor motion to accordingly adjust
the beam delivery, can systematically and fundamentally address the motion challenge. However, such a
technique is not yet available, and is currently facing three major challenges for the site of the liver: 1). The
respiration-induced fast liver motion requires real-time imaging within hundreds of milliseconds, which results
in extremely limited sampling that makes 3D deformable motion tracking challenging. 2). The low contrast of
liver tumors against surrounding normal liver parenchyma adds another layer of uncertainty to tumor motion
tracking. 3). The beam-tracking technique is purely ‘geometry-guided’, which requires fast energy switching
that is difficult to achieve in current proton systems. It also fails to consider cumulative tracking errors caused
by system latency, motion prediction error, and dose changes due to anatomical deformation. The overarching
goal of this project is to develop a real-time imaging and proton plan adaptation (RIPA) system, composed of
two sub-systems (MeshBioNet and MAO) to solve real-time 3D deformable motion (MeshBioNet) for
simultaneous dose calculation, accumulation, and on-the-fly proton plan adaptation (MAO). MeshBioNet uses
Artificial Intelligence-driven methods to solve real-time 3D deformable motion from a single x-ray projection.
MAO features the first closed-loop, ‘dosimetry-guided’ framework that actively monitors and adapts the proton
dose to ensure its matching with the planned dose without requiring tracking-related fast energy switching. We
have three Specific Aims: 1) Develop and optimize the real-time imaging sub-system (MeshBioNet), 2)
Develop and optimize the on-the-fly proton plan delivery adaptation sub-system (MAO), and 3). Test RIPA via
a pre-clinical motion-enabled phantom study and a retrospective patient study. The successful conduct of the
project will result in the first end-to-end system to improve the delivery accuracy of proton therapy for liver, and
to unleash the full potential of proton therapy, especially via SBRT, in advancing liver disease care."

Reductions in β-cell mass underlie the pathogenesis of all forms of diabetes, raising the relevance of
understanding the mechanisms controlling postnatal β-cell growth. Transcriptional networks regulate the
development, differentiation, and expansion of β cells, operating through islet enhancers, super-enhancers and
promoters forming 3-dimensional hubs. The homeodomain transcription factor and diabetes gene Pdx1 is a
critical member of this network, playing roles in β-cell differentiation, proliferation, and function. Despite the
importance of Pdx1 for β-cell growth, knowledge of the topological and biophysical properties of Pdx1 that
regulate β-cell mass are unclear. Our preliminary data reveal that β cells exhibit altered subnuclear localization
and reduced levels of Pdx1 protein as they advance through the cell cycle. Further, ectopically elevated levels
of Pdx1 prevent cell cycle progression and increase β-cell death, suggesting that dynamic regulation of
expression is required for effective β-cell expansion and maintenance of functional β-cell mass. We identify an
intrinsically disordered protein region (IDPR) of unknown function in the Pdx1 C-terminus (aa 207-223). IDPRs,
commonly found within transcription factors, lack fixed secondary structure and are amenable to flexible
conformations and phase separation. IDPRs promote protein-protein interactions and transcriptional hub
formation at super enhancers necessary for coordinated gene regulation. We previously identified the E3
ubiquitin ligase substrate adaptor protein SPOP as a PDX1 C-terminus protein partner (via aa224-238) that
mediates ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of PDX1. SPOP binds other IDPR partners in phase
separated nuclear compartments critical for their function. Thus, we hypothesize that the IDPR and SPOP
interaction domains within the Pdx1 C-terminus play critical, possibly interdependent, roles in Pdx1 protein
localization, expression, and function crucial for β-cell gene expression and proliferation. This hypothesis will be
tested in three Aims: (1) To investigate the dynamic subnuclear localization of PDX1 during the cell cycle
and in response to glucose. (2) To determine the role of IDPR-regulated phase separation in the function
and localization of PDX1. (3) To determine the role of SPOP in fine tuning PDX1 protein level and function.
Our studies will determine a novel and cohesive role for unstudied structural features of the Pdx1 C-terminus
and how they influence β-cell growth and glycemic control. Results of our proposed studies will inform therapeutic
efforts to optimize β-cell mass expansion ex vivo for cell based therapies and in vivo to treat patients with
diabetes."

Migraine headache is the most common neurological disorder and comes with great socioeconomic burden.
Much is still not known about the mediators and receptor subtypes involved in this debilitating disease, but
studies (preclinical and clinical) have shown that neurogenic inflammation as a result of neuropeptide release
may be involved. Animal studies have shown crosstalk between mast cells and meningeal nociceptors is crucial
to the initiation and maintenance of migraine. The mast cell specific GPCR MrgprB2, and its human homologue
MRGPRX2, is known to contribute to neurogenic inflammation in animal models of pain. Previous research
showed that activating MrgprB2 causes mast cells to release a broad range of pro-inflammatory cytokines,
contributing to pain pathophysiology. Our lab’s preliminary data reveals MrgprB2 receptors are expressed in the
resident tissue mast cells within the dura, in close proximity to meningeal afferents. We used a non-invasive
dural stimulation migraine model to demonstrate that activation of MrgprB2 by its agonist Compound 48/80
produced facial mechanical hypersensitivity and grimace expressions indicative of migraine-like pain behavior.
The endogenous neuropeptide Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide-38 (PACAP-38) has been found to
increase in the acute phase of migraine. We found PACAP-38 prompts MrgprB2-dependent mast cell
degranulation in vitro, indicating that PACAP-38 may act on MrgprB2 during migraine. This compelling
preliminary data supports testing our central hypothesis that MrgprB2/MRGPRX2-expressing mast cells play an
important role in the migraine pain pathway, interacting with meningeal afferents and the endogenous peptide
PACAP-38. The current application examines what role MrgprB2, and its human homologue MRGPRX2, may
play in triggering a migraine like pain phenotype, how the endogenous neuropeptide PACAP-38 may interact
with the immune system to induce migraine pain pathology via MrgprB2/MRGPRX2 activation, and whether
MrgprB2/MRGPRX2+ mast cells cause migraine like pain through direct activation of meningeal sensory
neurons. Using state-of the art approaches, the following specific aims will test our hypothesis: Aim 1.
Characterize the contribution of mast cells and their receptor MrgprB2/MRGPRX2 in mouse models of migraine
like pain. Aim 2. Examine MrgprB2/X2 interaction with known migraine-inducing endogenous peptide PACAP-
38. Aim 3. Examine the interaction between MrgprB2+/MRGPRX2+ mast cells and meningeal sensory neurons
in vivo. The proposed research is significant because it will examine the contribution of these mast cell receptors
to the mechanisms underlying migraine pain, expanding our understanding on MrgprB2 and MRGPRX2 and
their role in linking neural and immune systems to migraine-induced pain pathology. Importantly, MrgprB2/X2
may provide a new target to potentially treat migraine."

The past 20 years have seen significant changes in the US’s legal cannabis landscape alongside marked
changes in tobacco use, the leading cause of preventable mortality. Yet recreational cannabis legalization’s
(RCL’s) effects on tobacco product use remain unclear: few peer-reviewed studies directly test these effects
and quasi-experimental analyses—methods to generate causal estimates in the absence of randomization—
yield mixed findings on whether cannabis is an economic complement or substitute for cigarettes. These
dynamics are crucial: laws increasing cannabis access will decrease use of its substitutes and increase use of
its complements. Moreover, quasi-experimental studies largely ignore RCL’s effects on use of non-cigarette
tobacco products like cigars and electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), as well as potential effects of
state cannabis policy details (e.g., tax rates, formulation restrictions) and local cannabis laws (e.g., local taxes,
home delivery bans). If such effects are not anticipated, policymakers’ expectations of RCL’s costs and
benefits will be incorrect, and both state and local policymakers may miss opportunities to structure cannabis
laws in a manner that better protects their community’s health. To address this, we will compile a cannabis
policy database covering state RCL policy details, local cannabis policies, and retailer density, and match it to
nationally representative, restricted-use data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Aim 1A will
use these data to characterize variation in local access to cannabis retailers, local cannabis policies, and state
RCL policy details likely to impact cannabis access and use within RCL states. Aim 1B will assess these policies’
relationships to cannabis retailer density, perceived ease of cannabis access, and cannabis use, elucidating their
strength as unconfounded proxies for local cannabis retailer density and ease of access, and clarifying whether
the policies’ effects on cannabis use are strong enough to allow instrumental variable analyses of cannabis use’s
effect on tobacco product use. Considering cigarettes, cigars, ENDS, and blunts, Aim 2 will estimate RCL’s direct
effects on adult tobacco product use, test for effect modification from state RCL policy details and local
cannabis laws, and simulate implications for tobacco product use under alternative RCL scenarios (e.g.,
federal RCL, different cannabis tax rates, preempting local bans on retail sales). Aim 3 will conduct parallel
analyses and simulations for 12-20 year-olds. Results will extend the literature on RCL’s effects on tobacco
product use by accounting for a range of tobacco products, and increase its rigor by considering effect
modification due to variation in state policy details and local cannabis laws, separately for underage versus
21+ age-groups. Moreover, simulations of alternative policies’ effects on tobacco and nicotine use will clarify
potential unanticipated costs or benefits of different state and local cannabis policies, helping policymakers
identify policy options to best ensure continued progress towards eliminating tobacco’s toll in their community."
10801622,"Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an arthritogenic alphavirus that causes a painful musculoskeletal inflammatory
disease, which can persist for months to years. Chronic CHIKV arthritis is debilitating and produces substantial
social and economic consequences. Despite the burden posed by acute and chronic CHIKV disease, licensed
vaccines and antiviral therapeutics are not available. Virus-host interactions at the cell-surface dictate species
and tissue tropism and are often determinants of virulence. We discovered that multiple pathogenic strains of
CHIKV bind to heparan sulfate (HS), a type of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) that is highly variable in subunits and
modifications, to mediate adhesion to cells. Efficient binding and infection of biologically relevant cell types by
CHIKV depends on cell-surface HS, but little is known about the viral and host determinants that mediate these
initial contacts or how CHIKV-HS interactions influence virulence and disease outcomes. We hypothesize that
CHIKV has evolved an optimum affinity for unique HS structures, including N-sulfation, via specific residues of
CHIKV E2 to mediate efficient CHIKV attachment to target cells, which influences viral disease outcomes. Three
integrated but independent specific aims are proposed. In Specific Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that CHIKV
binds to specific modifications of HS chains to attach to target cells. A combination of biochemical, biophysical,
genetic, and virological techniques will be used to define specific HS structures required for binding and infection
of target cells, which will be genetically validated in target cells. Binding parameters will be biophysically charac-
terized. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that multiple HS binding sites on CHIKV virions are medi-
ated by specific basic residues in E2. The structural features and specific resides of E2 that facilitate CHIKV-HS
interactions will be defined by cryo-EM, and targeted mutagenesis of HS-binding sites will be used to engineer
mutants with a loss of function in HS binding. Viral mutants will be characterized for E2 functions in vitro and
used to determine the requirement of viral engagement with HS for binding and infection of target cells. In
Specific Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that decreased attachment to HS will result in attenuation in a mouse
model of disease. We will first elucidate the dependence of CHIKV binding to HS on target cells using mice
harboring conditional knockout of the HS-modifying gene Ndst1 in endothelial and muscle cells. Mice will also
be infected with a panel of viruses that display decreased capacity in binding to HS or entry receptor MXRA8 to
assess the specific function of virus engagement with HS in dissemination, cell tropism, immune responses, and
tissue. Studies in this application will define structural and biophysical parameters of CHIKV-HS binding, eluci-
date the significance of HS-dependent attachment to target cells, and unravel functions of virus-HS binding in
CHIKV pathogenesis. As many pathogenic viruses use GAGs as attachment factors, our work will contribute to
broad conceptual advances of virus-GAG interactions. New knowledge about CHIKV-HS interactions may inform
the rational design of specific antivirals targeting GAGs to block virus infection and diminish disease."
10801628,"Treatment of cancer is an ongoing process during which clinicians make a series of decisions at critical points
in a patient's disease by synthesizing baseline and evolving patient information with the goal of optimizing
expected long-term patient beneﬁt. We use the term “treatment” to refer broadly to therapeutic agents and
supportive behavioral interventions to mitigate adverse effects of therapies or symptoms, as well as to inter-
ventions focused on prevention and screening. An evidence-based approach to optimizing decision making
is to study entire sequential treatment strategies, which can be formalized as treatment regimes. A treatment
regime is a sequence of decision rules, each of which is associated with a key decision and uses accrued
information on a patient to select a treatment option from among the feasible options for the patient. An
optimal regime is one that maximizes expected patient beneﬁt in the population. Sequential multiple assign-
ment randomized trials (SMARTs), in which subjects are randomized at each of several key decision points to
feasible treatment options based on their accrued information, are ideally suited to discovery and evaluation
of treatment regimes, and a number of SMARTs in cancer have been conducted. At the same time, great
innovations have been made in cancer clinical trials; platform and response-adaptive trials that seek to op-
timize treatment for both participants and future patients and that allow for incorporation of new options and
elimination of ineffective options are increasingly being conducted. The potential for SMARTs to advance op-
timal sequential decision making in cancer treatment thus requires a next generation of design and analysis
methods for SMARTs that incorporate similar innovations in the more complex setting of multiple decisions
and repeated randomization of subjects and that address current cancer research priorities. The goal of this
project is to develop a comprehensive statistical framework for next-generation SMARTs in cancer research,
the ﬁrst steps toward which we will undertake through four speciﬁc aims. Our ﬁrst aim is to develop methods for
design and analysis of platform SMARTs that use response-adaptive randomization to favor optimal treatment
assignments and allow introduction of new treatments and discontinuation of ineffective treatments at any de-
cision point. Aim 2 is to develop methods for design and analysis of SMARTs involving multi-component and
multi-modal treatments at each decision point. Our third aim proposes a novel trial framework that merges a
SMART with a micro-randomized trial to allow joint optimization of sequential therapeutic decisions and selec-
tion of supportive mHealth interventions that address the adverse consequences of cancer therapy, where the
supportive interventions are chosen to maximize the success of therapy. In Aim 4, we develop a framework for
interim analysis of SMARTs, for which little methodology is available. The methods handle binary, continuous,
and censored time-to-event outcomes of interest in cancer research. A software package will be developed to
assist users in the design and analysis of next-generation SMARTs."

Title:
Models and Methods for Population Genomics
Abstract:
Understanding genome-wide genetic variation and its role in health-related complex traits in humans is one of
the most important goals of modern biomedical research. There continues to be a substantial need for new
statistical models and methods that can be applied in these studies, particularly as study designs become more
ambitious and sample sizes increase. The overarching goal of this grant is to develop statistical theory, methods,
and software useful in understanding population genomics studies that involve genome-wide genotyping, a wide
range of measured traits, very large sample sizes, structured populations, and varying study designs.
One of the most challenges aspects of modern population genomics studies is that there is a complex
evolutionary history underlying the present-day genetic variation that we observe. Individuals are members of
structured populations with varying levels of relatedness that do not follow the simple assumptions that underlie
classical population genetics theory. There is a need to model and estimate arbitrary forms of structure and
relatedness so that genetic variation in human populations can be accurately characterized, which in turn allows
for an accurate understanding of the genetic basis of complex traits. Our first focus is on flexible, broadly
applicable models that adapt to this arbitrary population structure and relatedness, resulting in principled
statistical methods that make accurate inferences. We then show how our methods improve the ability to identify
genetic associations, estimate genome-wide heritability of traits, and contribute to an understanding of how
predictive polygenic risk scores can be robustly constructed.
The specific aims involve (1) introducing a parametric framework for estimating kinship and FST, thereby bridging
identity-by-descent models with random allele frequency coancestry models of structure; (2) advancing models
and methods for quantifying genome-wide heritability, testing for associations, and building polygenic risk scores
by incorporating our new estimation framework of kinship and FST; (3) developing and distributing software; and
(4) analyzing important data sets to discover new biology and validate our methods and software."

To avoid potential harm and improve dental treatment success, dental clinicians (DCs) must obtain an up-to-
date medical and medication history of their patients. Recent studies have reported discrepancies with patient-
reported medical histories in electronic dental records (EDRs), and inconsistencies in physicians’ responses to
DCs’ medical consults leading to delayed dental care. Large healthcare organizations (HCO) such as dental
schools and health management organizations implemented integrated medical-dental electronic health record
(EHR) (integrated EHR-EDR) to improve communication and referral between medical and dental
professionals. However, deploying such systems alone will not resolve the current barriers because the
relevant patient-specific information may be fragmented across different HCOs, stored in various EHR
sections. Besides, most dental professionals are not credentialed with HCOs to have access to an integrated
EHR-EDR system. The emergence of community and vendor-supported health information exchanges (HIEs)
and the development of technologies and standards to exchange and display pertinent information is an
opportunity for DCs to establish an integrated care delivery model regardless of their practice setting.
The long-term goal is to improve communication and referrals between dental clinicians and medical
professionals to improve patient care and promote screening and preventive management of chronic diseases.
This proposal aims to develop and evaluate a usable patient medical summary (PMS) imported from the state-
wide community Indiana Health Information Exchange (IHIE) that updates a dental clinician about their
patients’ medical history and can be used even in solo- and small group dental practice settings. The central
hypothesis is that the PMS will have a higher percentage of complete and up-to-date medical information,
which will reduce the average time required to assess a dental patient case and determined by DCs to be
clinically useful. The three specific aims are: 1) Validate the relevance and timeliness of information items that
contribute to the PMS to assess a patients’ medical status; 2) develop prototypes that integrate the PMS with
an EDR through user-centered design methods; 3) evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the PMS with
general and specialist dentists. The two primary outcomes are a Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources
(FHIR)-based PMS application and a reconfigured Consolidated Clinical Document Architecture (C-CDA) that
reduce dental clinicians’ reliance on patients and physicians’ office for information and reduce patients’ burden
to share information with DCs. The proposed study will lay the foundation for an interprofessional dental-
medical care delivery that enhances dental and overall care among the US population, promotes preventive
management, and reduces dental care costs."

Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCA) have revolutionized MRI. They provide contrast and essential
diagnostic information that could not be obtained otherwise. For about 20 years, these compounds were
considered among the safest pharmaceuticals. However, in 2006 the causal relationship between the
development of a devastating and potentially fatal condition named nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) and
GBCAs in renocompromized patients was established. The FDA has since placed restrictions on the use of
GBCAs for patients with impaired kidney function, virtually eliminating the risk of NSF; however leaving some
patients without having access to potentially lifesaving contrast-enhanced MRI. The more recent reports that
gadolinium deposits cumulatively in the brain, bones, and skin, even in patients with intact blood-brain-barrier
and normal renal and hepatobiliary functions, with unknown long-term hazard significance, have raised many
concerns among the scientific community and patients. The last few years have seen breakthroughs in the
development of metal-free MRI contrast agents based on macromolecular templates loaded with sterically
shielded nitroxide radicals. These metal-free MRI contrast agents have demonstrated high efficacy in vivo with
the ability to provide contrast in disease tissues (e.g., tumors). However, the current designs are limited by the
instability of nitroxides radicals in vivo, leading to reduced diamagnetic hydroxylamines. The PI's lab has
recently reported the synthesis of a highly biocompatible triarylmethyl radical with unmatched in vivo stability,
named OX063. This radical has the capability to solve the stability issues of nitroxide-based organic radical
contrast agents (ORCA). Moreover, Ox063’s trivalent shape makes it a natural dendrimer building block. In
this project, we propose to develop OX063-based dendrimers as the next generation of metal-free MRI
contrast agents. In specific aim 1, we will synthesize and characterize OX063-based dendrimers as dual MRI
and fluorescent agents. A set of ORCAs will be decorated with a tumor-associated macrophage-binding
peptide for active tumor targeting. In specific aim 2, we will perform in vitro and in vivo distribution,
metabolism, excretion, toxicology, and pharmacokinetic studies, and in vivo imaging validation. Finally, in
specific aim 3, we will demonstrate the application of OX063-based dendrimers for in vivo MRI tumor imaging
in a mouse model of breast cancer. Active and passive targeting of the new ORCAs will be compared. The
completion of the project will provide highly biostable metal-free contrast agents which can significantly impact
the field of biomedical imaging."

Variations in sex traits (VST; also known as differences of sex development or Intersex) are congenital
conditions characterized by incongruence between genetic, gonadal, and/or phenotypic sex. Youth with VST
often exhibit complex clinical presentations, including atypical genitalia, unique gender-related needs (e.g.,
related to anatomical differences, gender identity diversity), sexual/urological dysfunction, and fertility
impairment. Interdisciplinary care is the standard of care for youth with VST given interrelated medical, mental
health, and developmental care challenges which typically demand careful clinical decision-making and clear,
coordinated communication between providers and youth. Many VST-related care decisions made during
childhood and adolescence have life-long implications for sexual and urogenital functioning, fertility, quality of
life, and mental health. Individuals with VST are at heightened risk for experiencing psychological trauma
related to their care which often includes frequent genital exams and discussions of highly personal sex- and
gender-related concerns with multiple care providers. Interdisciplinary care teams currently lack a standardized,
youth-attuned means of obtaining information from youth to help guide personalized care and facilitate shared
decision-making. There are no validated measures to capture the care preferences, needs, and care-related
experiences of youth with VST, or the health disparities these young people face, including intragroup VST
disparities (e.g., those with/without interdisciplinary care access or neurodevelopmental disability). Therefore,
this proposal, which builds on three NIH-funded pilot projects, finalizes the development, calibration, and
validation of a VST self-advocacy tool, called the VISTA (Variations in Sex Traits Advocacy Tool), to capture
youth needs and preferences and the disparities they face. AIM 1 expands and refines the pilot VISTA itemset
to ensure item coverage, comprehension, and cultural attunement for key VST disparity subgroups (i.e., youth
with neurodevelopmental disability; youth without interdisciplinary care access). AIM 2 recruits 600 youth and
emerging adults with VST (ages 11-21), balanced across care access, ethno-racial identity, gender identity
diversity, and neurodevelopmental diversity. Scale development research procedures, including latent variable
modeling and differential item functioning, will produce subscales that function equitably across diverse youth.
Convergent and discriminant validation will be tested with measures of mental health, traumatic stress/stigma,
body image, and patient engagement in shared decision-making. Ecological validity will be evaluated with
mixed methods follow-up interviews in a striated subsample of youth. Test-retest reliability will be assessed at
one month. In AIM 3, within-group VST disparities will be examined across ethno-racial identity, care access
and geography, gender identity diversity, and neurodiversity through sequential GLM models testing the
contributions of predictors and intersectionality between predictors. This proposal represents a critical step
towards facilitating personalized, equitable care for youth with VST."

Professor of Medicine at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health. I obtained my MD
from the University of Michigan and American Board of Internal Medicine research fast track in internal medicine

Deming to study mechanisms of targeted therapeutic resistance in colorectal cancer organoid models. I currently
serve as subject matter expert in gastrointestinal cancers with the VA National Precision Oncology Program. My
goal is to develop an independent research program specific to hepatobiliary cancers to improve the health
outcomes of Veterans through precision applications informed from organotypic models. I was recruited to the
William S. Middleton Memorial Veterans Hospital and the University of Wisconsin with support of clinical and
research efforts dedicated to building our research program through institutional mentorship, laboratory
resources, and start-up funding.
Research Project: Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) represents a leading cause cancer-related mortality with 5 year
survival estimated <10% in the United States. Patient-derived organoid models have improved pre-clinical
modeling of gastrointestinal cancers. There remains a significant unmet need to standardize these models in
CCA with a critical gap in knowledge to understand if these models can predict clinical outcomes. Chemotherapy
is standard in clinical management for advanced CCA, however therapeutic resistance is universal for advanced
disease. We propose a dedicated investigation of organoid modeling under therapeutic treatment for the
prediction of clinical response. Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) functions as a key regulator of RNA
polymerase II is overexpressed in nearly 40% of CCA. It has recently been shown to have activity using historic
2D models of CCA as monotherapy. Here, we present a dedicated assessment of CDK7 targeting in response
to DNA damaging chemotherapy in CCA. Using models stratified by key mediators of cell cycle and homologous
DNA damage, we propose to quantitate therapeutic response. We aim to understand the fundamental
mechanisms specific to response by characterizing DNA damage, cell cycle arrest and the inhibition of RNA
polymerase II. Our central hypothesis is that the sensitivity of CCA organoids will predict prospective
clinical outcomes and that CDK7 inhibition (CDK7i) will improve sensitivity to chemotherapy-induced
DNA damage as a lead therapeutic combination from patient-derived models. We will investigate this
hypothesis with three specific aims. Specific Aim 1: Quantify the effect of CDK7i on cell cycle propagation,
activation of RNA polymerase II, and DNA damage repair in CCA organoid models. Specific Aim 2: Validate
the response of CCA organoids to chemotherapy as predictive of clinical outcomes. Specific Aim 3: Evaluate
activity of CDK7i in combination with chemotherapy in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of CCA.
Career Plan: My long-term career goal is to become an independently funded VA physician-scientist who is a
leader in the field of treating gastrointestinal malignancy by targeting shared mechanisms of transcription-
mediated resistance. My primary VA research mentor, Dr. Mark Albertini, will guide my progress and training.
My additional mentors and collaborators will provide the training to accomplish my research aims and career
goals and further my knowledge of cancer stem cell modeling and liver cancer biology. The results from this
CDA-2 will provide me with the preliminary data and research experience to formulate a competitive MERIT
Review proposal to further develop novel therapeutic targets for hepatobiliary cancers.
Environment: I will complete the proposed research at the Madison VA and the University of Wisconsin. Both
organizations provide an exceptionally collegial atmosphere and strong institutional support that include

Ischemia with non-obstructive chronic coronary artery disease (CAD) is more prevalent than obstructive CAD
in women. Veterans in particular, are at higher risk of ischemic heart disease (IHD) due to prevalent non-
traditional (mental illness, Agent Orange exposure, and lifestyle choices) and traditional risk factors, regardless
of sex. Half of patients referred for invasive coronary angiograms have no obstructive CAD, whereas 3 in 4
have coronary microvascular disease (CMD), most of whom are women. Often, CMD passes undiagnosed but
contributes to excess morbidity, health resource utilization, impaired quality of life, and major adverse
cardiovascular events. This is partly because current non-invasive imaging approaches are not specifically
tailored for CMD but were optimized for detection of obstructive epicardial CAD, and invasive coronary testing
is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of CMD. In the past 4 years, our group has focused on a gadolinium-free
stress cardiac MRI approach that overcomes several drawbacks of first-pass perfusion stress cardiac MRI for
women with IHD. We showed that MRI-derived myocardial vasoreactivity and fractional myocardial blood
volume mapping have high specificity as markers of hypoperfusion. Our preliminary results illustrate that MRI-
derived fractional myocardial blood volume mapping has potential to depict the full spectrum of IHD. In this
MERIT renewal, we aim to further target our gadolinium-free MRI approach for CMD by enabling whole-heart
coverage and depiction of coronary morphologic indices. We further propose to develop computational
hemodynamic models that enable patient-specific mechanistic relationships between CMD and IHD to be
studied. Cardiac MRI is attractive for depiction of myocardial IHD in women because it has high spatial
resolution, lacks ionizing radiation, and when coupled with iron-based blood pool agents, imaging in the
steady-state offers higher spatial resolution than is possible with first-pass gadolinium perfusion approaches.
MRI better captures the spatial heterogeneity inherent in the spectrum of IHD. Successful completion of the
proposed work would result in clinical deployment of a comprehensive gadolinium-free cardiac MRI approach
for detection of CMD and a set of methods for in silico estimation of patient-specific coronary hemodynamic
parameters based on imaging targets."
10809626,"Approximately 30% of the drugs on the market exert their biological activities upon binding to G-protein
Coupled Receptors (GPCRs). As biological targets, GPCRs are associated with exceptional progress in the
field of drug research, enabling the application of molecular strategies for the discovery of innovative therapeutic principles. However, a short coming of this class of drugs that bind to the orthosteric site allows for many potential adverse side effects by also targeting other closely related receptor subtypes and other off- target sits. A new class of drugs called allosteric modulators are rapidly being developed in the pharmaceutical industry that limit these shortcomings by binding to unique sites on the receptor separate from the orthosteric site and have no activity on their own. Positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) enhance endogenous ligand activity through either augmenting efficacy or potency and only when the endogenous ligand is bound to the receptor. So an “off” receptor stays off even if the PAM is circulating in the body. While Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is characterized by neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, composed mostly of b-amyloid and tau, clinical trials focused on amyloid immunotherapies have been disappointing. Loss of neuronal synaptic density is another invariant feature of the disease that appears to precede neuronal loss and this is where agents targeted to enhance neurogenesis, long term potentiation, and synaptic plasticity in cognitive areas may benefit AD patients and may provide an alternative method of treatment, particularly in light of the disappointing immunotherapies. The α1A-adrenergic receptor (AR) subtype is a GPCR together with two-other closely related subtypes (a1B, a1D) plus six other more distantly-related subtypes (b1, b2, b3, a2A, a2B, a2C). We have previously shown in vivo and in vitro that the α1A-AR subtype is expressed in key cognitive centers of the brain, is both cardiac and neuroprotective, and activation of this receptor can increase cognition, synaptic plasticity, long term potentiation, and adult neurogenesis in normal WT mice. We have developed a novel small molecular weight
compound that is orally bioactive and is a PAM of the a1A-AR. It is selective for the norepinephrine-bound
receptor only and has no effect on the epinephrine-bound receptor. This PAM is not an agonist and does not invoke signaling on its own. However, it potentiates the NE-mediated cAMP response which is responsible for the cognitive benefits of NE in the brain with no effects on the inositol phosphate response which mediates peripheral cardiovascular effects, and particularly increased blood pressure. We have performed a 10 month dosing study with this PAM in vivo in the 3xTG AD mouse model and showed statistically increased long term potentiation, synaptic plasticity, and cognitive improvement with no apparent toxicity and no increase in blood pressure. Our objective is to further derivatize our lead PAM to improve its novel features, to perform target engagement studies, and to show dose-efficacy in an aged normal rat model."
10809627,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Our long-term goal is to ensure that rigorous, best-practice scientific methods are consistently applied in
experiments generating preclinical data for potential therapies for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The number of AD
cases is rising dramatically worldwide, and there is an urgent need to develop effective new therapies beyond
the modest efficacy of the current FDA approved drugs for AD. Given that data from preclinical drug screening
in animal models are used to inform clinical trials in AD patients, it is critical to ensure the highest level of rigor
and assurances for successful translation from animal models to human patients. Unfortunately, in preclinical
drug testing studies, there has been evidence of deficiencies in experimental design, sample size, data analysis,
optimization of drug screening pipelines, and experience of individuals generating the data, together indicating
a need for better training in preclinical drug discovery and translational medicine methodologies and processes.
Over the last three years we have successfully delivered an annual course that meets this need by providing the
necessary hands-on as well as theoretical training in fundamental skillsets required for conducting rigorous in
vivo studies in AD mouse models. Herein we propose to continue providing this nationally available, immersion
workshop focused on Principles and Techniques for Improving Preclinical Translation of Alzheimer’s Disease
Research, to be held at The Jackson Laboratory (JAX) in Bar Harbor, ME that will leverage the expertise of the
Indiana University (IU)/JAX/University of Pittsburgh (PITT) Model Organism Development for Evaluation of Late
Onset Alzheimer’s Disease (MODEL-AD) consortium. This training collaboration will convene experts with
diverse complementary skills ranging from mouse genetics to statistics to preclinical testing at a state-of-the-art
residential conference center and hands-on training facility for mice at JAX. The workshop will ensure a diverse
group across professional levels and have appropriate representation of traditionally underrepresented
individuals as workshop participants, and supported by scholarships. In line with the NIH initiative on rigor and
reproducibility, the workshop aims to address training gaps in preclinical drug screening by providing participants
with the skills and knowledge required for rigorous design, execution, analysis, and reporting of pharmacokinetic,
pharmacodynamics, and preclinical efficacy experiments. The workshop is innovative in that it includes a
significant amount of hands-on, practical laboratory training in in vivo drug screening methodologies. The specific
aims of the workshop are to 1) Train participants in the rigorous design, experimental execution, analysis, and
reporting of data in line with the ARRIVE guidelines for preclinical testing of AD therapies. 2) Provide participants
with the practical laboratory tools and skills to perform rigorous, reproducible preclinical tests on mouse models
of AD. 3) Promote interaction and discussion between faculty and students to foster open, honest dialogue and
collaborative research across a diversity of participant backgrounds. Our innovative and comprehensive
workshop will offer a critical, unique hands-on training experience that is possible only at JAX."
10809749,"Project Summary/ Abstract
 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an inflammatory disease of the lungs that results in
airflow limitation; it affects 24 million adults in the United States, and is the third leading cause of death. Recent
studies challenge the paradigm that COPD is uniformly progressive, but the mechanisms that underlie distinct
trajectories of disease progression are not well understood. A major hurdle in the advancement of therapies that
alter the progression of disease is our inability to precisely phenotype individuals with variable disease trajectories;
reliable surrogate biomarkers to predict clinical progression in individual subjects are lacking. Furthermore, existing
pharmacotherapies have a modest impact on respiratory morbidity and fail to impact the rate of FEV1 decline.
These medications target airway tone and inflammation, and none directly target structural changes involving the
airways or alveolar remodeling (emphysema) that underlie FEV1 change. Thus, a major gap in understanding is
the identification of inter-dependent pathways of structural airway/alveolar remodeling that determine disease
progression which would inform more precise diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for COPD.
 The origins of COPD are believed to be in the small conducting airways less than 2 mm in diameter but these
data are mostly cross-sectional. In addition, COPD is characterized by both airway remodeling and alveolar
destruction; it is likely that both processes contribute to disease initiation and progression. Our preliminary findings
suggest that disease progression occurs due to a complex interplay of structural changes in the lungs, both in the
parenchyma and in the airways, including mechanical stretch of normal parenchyma, distribution of emphysema,
and airway remodeling. Disease progression is not reflected entirely by FEV1 changes and progression of structural
disease is an important determinant of disease trajectory. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that structural
anatomic and mechanical factors in both the airway and alveolar compartments contribute to disease progression in
COPD.
 To test these hypotheses, we will analyze data from two large well-characterized cohorts (Genetic
Epidemiology of COPD, COPDGene, and Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcome Measures in COPD Study,
SPIROMICS) with 5-year follow-up with the following specific aims. Aim 1 of this application will be to determine
whether mechanically affected lung leads to initiation and progression of emphysema. In Aim 2, we will determine
whether the spatial distribution of emphysema influences disease progression. In Aim 3, we will determine whether
longitudinal changes in airway remodeling are associated with lung function decline.
 The results will identify mechanisms of disease progression, establish novel imaging biomarkers, and help
create precise models that will allow development of more targeted therapies to attenuate disease progression."

10809753,"Project Summary
Microglia, the immune cells of the brain, perform essential homeostatic functions including debris clearance by
phagocytosis and maintenance of neurons by release of growth factors and other molecules. However, during
Alzheimer’s disease (AD), microglia accumulate near amyloid plaques where they acquire an activated
phenotype, lose their homeostatic phenotype, and take on an activated phenotype that can induce
neurotoxicity. Intracellular calcium in microglia regulates their transformation from this homeostatic resting
state to an activated immune-effector state. Microglia intracellular calcium orchestrates functions such as
phagocytosis, proliferation, migration, generation of neurotrophic factors, cytokine production and release, and
formation of neurotoxic reactive oxygen species. Intracellular calcium dysregulation appears in activated, non-
homeostatic microglia near amyloid β (Aβ) plaques in mouse models of AD. Our overall hypothesis that
dysregulated intracellular calcium shifts microglia phenotype in AD. Our preliminary data suggest that blocking
L-type voltage dependent calcium channels (L-VDCCs) can shift microglia towards a more homeostatic
phenotype. The proposed experiments test the hypothesis that L-VDCCs can drive microglia calcium
dysregulation during AD pathology. We will test this by using pharmacological antagonism of L-VDCCs
combined with genetic ablation of microglia-specific L-VDCCs in the presence of AD pathology to define the
role of L-VDCCs on microglia phenotype and function. For the training aspect of this proposal, we will use 1) in
vivo multiphoton imaging to assess microglia function and calcium dynamics and 2) single-nuclei RNA
sequencing to define the cell-specific effects of L-VDCC antagonism in vivo. If our hypothesis is correct, L-
VDCC function will be a mechanistic link microglia calcium dysregulation and microglia functional phenotype
during AD. This finding would be relevant to numerous age-associated neurodegenerative disorders where
changes in microglia phenotype are observed."
10809755,"Project Abstract
β cell mass and function adapts to the insulin requirements of the organism to maintain euglycemia across a
wide range of pathophysiology, such as insulin resistance induced by obesity, pregnancy or aging. Although
molecular mechanisms that enable β cell adaptation to these stressors are not yet fully understood, insufficient
functional adaptation becomes clinically apparent with the onset of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). With the continued
increase in obesity, novel therapeutically-tractable pathways that regulate β cell adaptation are sought to
reverse β cell dysfunction in T2D.
Notch is a highly conserved family of proteins critical for cell fate decision-making; in the developing endocrine
pancreas, Notch signaling regulates β cell differentiation, but less is known about Notch action in mature
tissue. We have recently shown that Notch signaling is present at low levels in fully developed β cells, but
increased in islets cultured in high glucose or isolated from obese mice. Persistent β cell Notch signaling
appears detrimental to function, as we observed improved glucose tolerance with genetic inhibition of β cell
Notch action. Conversely, forced Notch activation impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in
isolated mouse or human islets, and induced glucose intolerance in β cell-specific Notch gain-of-function mice.
In Aim 1, we investigate mechanism of increased β cell Notch activity, leveraging data showing that β cell
expression of the Notch ligand, Jagged1, tracks with Notch activity. We test whether β cell Jagged1 is
necessary and sufficient for the maladaptive β cell Notch response in obesity. In Aim 2, we address
mechanism of Notch-induced GSIS defects. In key preliminary data, we found that Notch induces degradation
of MafA, a key regulator of β cell maturity disrupted in T2D. We also observe novel MafA acetylations, blocked
by Notch activity. We now study whether MafA stability and activity is dependent on acetylations, and elucidate
the molecular machinery underlying these post-translational modifications. We also test whether Notch impacts
stability and acetylation of the closely related transcription factor, MafB. Finally, in Aim 3, we test implications
of our identified NOTCH-MAFA/B axis in human β cell transcriptional and function response to glucose, as well
as effects on β cell heterogeneity in human islets. Achieving the goals of this application will determine
upstream signals for Notch activation, downstream effectors of Notch-induced β cell dysfunction, and
potentially develop novel therapeutic directions for the care of patients with T2D."

10812366,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common consequence of combat that is manifested in part by
trauma-related hyperarousal and reactivity, seen in increased startle responses and impaired sleep that result
from central and autonomic nervous system alterations. In fact, disturbed sleep is the most prevalent symptom
endorsed by PTSD patients and is potentially debilitating in many domains of functioning (1, 2). As a relatively
non-stigmatizing symptom, it is no surprise that disturbed sleep is often the reason that motivates Veterans
with PTSD to seek treatment (3, 4). However, most drugs that target sleep result in unwanted side effects,
such as next day somnolence, which can impact functioning in both military and civilian life. Furthermore, aside
from several SSRI's that are only moderately effective in improving PTSD, little progress has been made
toward advancing pharmacological treatments for PTSD and in Veterans.
Preclinical evidence suggests that the orexin neuropeptide system may be a shared mechanism accounting for
both sleep disturbance and PTSD. Orexin is a central promoter of wakefulness involved in regulation of sleep,
and in fear learning and emotional memory. The dual orexin receptor antagonist, suvorexant, is the first of a
new class of medications recently FDA-approved to treat insomnia. In contrast to previous generations of
treatments used for patients with PTSD that provide delayed and often inadequate symptom relief, suvorexant
holds promise of delivering immediate relief for pressing sleep concerns while also potentially reducing PTSD
symptoms by targeting a biological mechanism that may account for both conditions. While its efficacy for
insomnia has been strongly supported by clinical trials (5-8), the potential benefit of suvorexant on trauma-
related sleep disturbance and on PTSD symptoms has not been examined, nor has it been evaluated for
safety and tolerability in Veterans.
We propose a two-site parallel group, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase IV clinical trial to
test the efficacy and safety of suvorexant on trauma-related sleep disturbance and PTSD symptoms in
Veterans. We will use a flexible dose design of suvorexant with a 2-week titration followed by a 10-week
steady-dose phase. We predict that suvorexant, as compared to placebo, will result in a greater decrease in
insomnia on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) over the 12-week trial. We also predict that suvorexant, as
compared to placebo, will result in a greater reduction in non-sleep PTSD symptoms in the Clinician
Administered PTSD Scale for DSMV (CAPS-5) over the 12-week trial. Secondarily, we will examine potential
objectively measured wrist actigraphy as a biological mechanism of clinical improvement with as well as
concomitant effects on PTSD-related nightmares using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index-PTSD addendum
(PSQI-A). Pending a significant effect of suvorexant on PTSD, we will perform exploratory analyses to evaluate
whether sleep improvement mediates the effect of suvorexant on PTSD symptoms. We will also examine
safety and tolerability of suvorexant compared to placebo (including depression, mood, vigor, suicidality, and
daytime somnolence, psychomotor vigilance, and functional disability). Results from this study will provide
substantive rationale for the use of Suvorexant in the treatment of Veterans with these concerns. This study
will be the first to examine a selective orexin-receptor antagonist in a Veteran sample with PTSD. Suvorexant
is an accessible, non-stigmatized medication whose use and safety has been well-established in non-mental-
health settings. It has outstanding promise for treating common and distressing symptoms in Veterans as well
as civilians with trauma-related sleep disturbance and PTSD."

More than 80% of children diagnosed with a malignancy now survive five years, with most living well into
adulthood. This has resulted in a growing population of childhood cancer survivors, estimated to approach half
a million by 2020. Unfortunately, curative treatments result in toxicities that leave many survivors with a
substantial burden of adverse physical and mental health outcomes. Morbidities commonly observed after
childhood cancer treatment include neurocognitive impairment in 40-50% of survivors, emotional distress, and
cardiovascular disease. These late effects are often comorbid and may interact to synergistically contribute to
adverse health outcomes. Symptoms of insomnia, reported by approximately 30-45% of adult survivors of
childhood cancer, are believed to be a key player in this dynamic. We have demonstrated that insomnia is
associated with neurocognitive impairment in adult survivors of childhood cancer and that reduction in insomnia
is associated with improved cognitive performance. In the general population, insomnia is also associated with
increased cardiovascular symptoms, including a 45% increased risk of developing or dying from cardiovascular
disease. We hypothesize that by treating insomnia, improvements will be observed in neurocognitive function,
emotional distress, and biomarkers of cardiovascular risk. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBTi) is
an established non-pharmacologic treatment that focuses on addressing problematic thoughts and behaviors
related to insomnia. However, limited access to and availability of health care professionals trained to deliver
CBTi has led to development of internet-based CBTi, which has been found effective in treating insomnia and
comorbid psychological and fatigue symptoms in the general population and in survivors of adult onset cancers.
We are proposing to conduct a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of an internet-based CBTi
intervention (SHUTi) on insomnia in adult survivors of childhood cancer. Importantly, while SHUTi has been
shown to be efficacious in other populations, symptoms of insomnia in adult survivors of childhood
cancer may have persisted for several decades and often co-occur with other treatment-related late
effects. Therefore, we propose to examine the direct impact of SHUTi on improving insomnia, and the mediating
effect of improved insomnia on neurocognitive functioning. We also will examine the contribution of changes in
emotional distress and biomarkers of cardiovascular health following treatment for insomnia to survivor quality
of life. We will recruit 352 survivors with comorbid insomnia and neurocognitive problems from the Childhood
Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS). Positive results from this study cohort and our use of an internet-based
intervention are likely to generalize and be scalable to the large and geographically diverse population of
childhood cancer survivors with chronic health conditions."
10812494,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Obesity is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, fatty liver disease, and some cancers. In
response to caloric excess, white adipose tissue (WAT) depots expand through hypertrophy and hyperplasia.
Hypertrophy, the increase in size of preexisting white adipocytes, is associated with an unhealthy metabolic
state, elevated inflammation, and insulin resistance. In contrast, WAT hyperplasia, the recruitment of the new fat
cells from progenitors that reside in the adipose tissue stromal vascular (SV) niche, is associated with a more
metabolically healthy state. Obesity also can induce the pathological accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM)
proteins in WAT, which is strongly associated with metabolic perturbations. The signaling pathways that regulate
adipose tissue fibrosis are currently unknown; however, regulatory pathways that activate progenitor cells in the
adipose tissue SV niche likely determine the balance between profibrotic and adipogenic cell fates. Because
fibrosis is controlled by secreted factors that impinge on the SV niche, targeting this compartment, rather than
the differentiated adipocyte itself, may represent a novel avenue for therapeutic intervention to treat obesity and
metabolic complications. We discovered that the secreted protein aortic carboxypeptidase-like protein (ACLP) is
activated in SV cells and it represses adipocyte differentiation, while stimulating a profibrotic cell fate. In addition,
our preliminary findings connect ACLP signaling to the transforming growth factor β and platelet derived growth
factor receptor pathways. We hypothesize that activation of ACLP signaling pathways in the SV niche blunts
adipogenic hyperplasia and induces fibrosis, contributing to WAT dysfunction and metabolic disease. To test this
hypothesis, in Aim 1 we will use novel ACLP recombinant proteins and high resolution
proteomics/phosphoproteomics in studies of adipose tissue SV progenitor cells to delineate ACLP signaling
cascades that repress adipogenic differentiation and stimulate ECM production. In Aim 2 we will identify the
initiating mechanisms that lead to the expansion of profibrotic cells and ECM production in WAT using isolated
blood vessels and WAT organ culture. In Aim 3 we will determine whether eliminating ACLP signaling in vivo in
the adipose tissue SV niche enhances adipocyte hyperplasia and protects against diet induced metabolic
disease. We will conditionally delete ACLP in the SV niche in mice subjected to a high and low fat diets. Measures
of WAT fibrosis, whole body metabolism, and vascular remodeling will test whether eliminating ACLP-dependent
signaling in the SV niche prevents WAT fibrosis and provides metabolic benefit. The anticipated outcome of
these studies is the identification of signaling pathways that control a profibrotic/anti-adipogenic cell fate switch,
which drives pathological WAT remodeling and a metabolically unhealthy state. We envision that blunting ACLP
signaling by identifying actionable signaling targets in the SV niche will reduce pathological ECM accumulation
as an intervention to inhibit obesity-induced diseases."
10812498,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Islet transplantation is a β-cell replacement therapy used to treat diabetic patients who lack the ability to secrete
insulin. The conventional site for islet transplantation is the liver, however, this is far from optimal given that islets
are subjected to hypoxia, toxic metabolites from the liver, a pro-inflammatory environment and an instant blood-
mediated inflammatory reaction (IBMIR); together, this results in up to 60-70% of islets being immediately lost
following transplantation. Furthermore, given that islet transplantation does not require the creation of a surgical
vascular anastomosis, islets therefore need to build and secure a dedicated blood supply, which takes at least
3 weeks. In the interim, islets have to survive by relying on the diffusion of oxygen and nutrients (such as essential
amino acids like glutamine and alanine) from the microenvironment of the transplantation site, which results in
them enduring significant stress and bioenergetic depletion. Accordingly, we have identified several critical
problems in the transplantation process which we have addressed with our innovative and clinically translatable
solution that will maintain islet health and survival, during, and following, their transplantation. Recently, we
developed and validated a novel collagen based cryogel 3D matrix that incorporates an oxygen generator to
address the problem of insufficient oxygen which causes islet hypoxia. In Aim 1, we will functionalize this
bioscaffold platform with a nutrient generator in the form of a mesoporous silica nanoparticle that releases amino
acids. The release of both oxygen and amino acids to islets using these technologies will be modulated to ensure
it is continuous over 3-weeks. Given isolated islets are stressed and exhibit exhaustion, which is further
exacerbated following their transplantation, in Aim 2 we will aim to re-energize islets and restore their
bioenergetic potential immediately after isolation using bone marrow derived mesenchymal cells (BM-MSCs);
these cells can transfer their healthy mitochondria to islets via tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) and this can be
potentiated when BM-MSCs are in close proximity to islets – hence, we will activate our bioscaffold platform by
pre-seeding it with BM-MSCs. In Aim 3, we will then test the ability of our optimized “active” bioscaffold to restore
glycemic control in diabetic animal models at 2 extra-vascular sites of transplantation (i.e. the omentum and the
subcutaneous space) given this will mitigate the IBMIR normally encountered by islets following their delivery
into the liver via the portal vein. At each of these sites, we will examine whether our active bioscaffold elicits an
inflammatory response and foreign body reaction in the short term, and fibrosis/encapsulation in the long term;
we expect these responses to be minimal given our bioscaffolds are made from collagen and they contain BM-
MSCs that have potent anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and anti-fibrotic effects via their paracrine ability
to release cytokines and extracellular vesicles. This data will pave the way for future clinical trials with our novel
platform which can be scaled and produced conforming to GMP guidelines."
10812373,"Although pain inhibition by the central nervous system (CNS) strongly modulates acute pain in the lab, its
relevance for patient outcomes is less well known. Studies with animal models, human behavioral paradigms,
and neuroimaging have implicated central pain inhibition in the pathophysiology of chronic pain. However, the
most commonly used assessments of central pain inhibition in patients are limited by technical aspects,
expense, and accessibility, preventing their widespread use and resulting in a knowledge gap in how central
pain inhibition impacts patient outcomes and treatment response. The goal of the current project is to define
changes in central pain inhibition in patients with chronic pain using novel brain and behavioral tools, including
functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and offset analgesia. FNIRS allows cost-effective measurement
of activity-dependent cortical hemodynamic changes in an ambulatory, clinic based setting. Offset analgesia,
defined as a reduction in subjective pain intensity if a noxious stimulus is preceded by a stronger stimulus, is
mechanistically distinct from the most commonly used measure of central pain inhibition, conditioned pain
modulation. The central hypothesis is that offset analgesia is impaired and its neural correlates altered in
patients with chronic pain. Additionally, we hypothesize that greater loss of central pain inhibition at baseline is
associated with greater pain relief with duloxetine, which may rescue deficient pain inhibition. The proposal
rationale is that measures of pain inhibition will identify subgroups of patients which will improve future RCTs
by focusing studies on phenotypically-distinct populations and, ultimately, improving patient care by
personalizing pain treatment. In this career development award, three aims are proposed. First, the
relationship of offset analgesia and chronic pain intensity will be evaluated in a cross-sectional study
comparing offset analgesia magnitude across patients with high or low chronic knee pain intensity but the
same degree of joint degeneration. Second, in this same study, fNIRS will be used to define cortical correlates
of offset analgesia, extending the applicant’s preliminary data in young, healthy volunteers. Third, a
prospective trial will be performed in patients with chronic knee pain as a first step in investigating the impact of
pain inhibition on treatment response to duloxetine. These studies provide hands-on training for the applicant
in developing research skills related to brain imaging and clinical trials and will be complemented by mentoring
and evaluation meetings, formal didactics coursework, seminars, and meetings. The project will be conducted
at the University of Pittsburgh, which has outstanding support for clinical and translational research and a long
history of developing independent physician-scientists. Together, this project will position the applicant well to
achieve independence in chronic pain patient-oriented research and allow subsequent studies rigorously
examining central pain inhibition as a predictive biomarker of treatment response."
10812499,"Project Summary/Abstract
Chronic pain is a debilitating condition that causes long-term disability. Chronic pain causes negative affective
states that often lead to anxious ruminating thoughts and depressed mood, where patients have to constantly
decide between behaviors that minimize pain but restrict daily life or to persevere through pain. Current
treatments for chronic pain often involve prescription opioids. While prescription opioids provide much needed
analgesia, opioids also have a high abuse potential that puts patients at risk of developing an opioid addiction.
The motivational-affective changes caused by chronic pain indicate that this debilitating condition itself may
increase risk for opioid addiction. Chronic pain and affective disorders show dysfunction within the nucleus
accumbens core (cNAc), a region in the brain’s reward circuit that receives dopaminergic inputs from the
ventral tegmental area (VTA) and has a significant role in motivation and learning of cue-reward associations. I
hypothesize that chronic pain (1) increases the addictive potential of opioids through changes in dopamine
signaling that increase the strength of learned positive cue associations, and (2) increases motivation to obtain
opioid rewards. In this proposal, I will test how learned positive cue associations and motivational effort for
obtaining opioid rewards is altered by pain. In Aim 1, I will use a neuropathic pain animal model, Pavlovian
conditioning for a sucrose reward, and in vivo fiber photometry to test the effect of untreated acute and chronic
pain on VTA to cNAc dopamine signaling during extinction and reinstatement for a food reward. In Aim 2, I will
use the same pain model in conjunction with in vivo fiber photometry to examine how chronic pain changes
VTA to cNAc dopamine signaling during an operant task for opioid reward. Results from these experiments will
aid in identifying behavioral and neurobiological interactions between pain and opioid addiction. My proposal,
in accordance with NIDA’s goals, would aid in identifying the biological and behavioral causes and
consequences of drug use and addiction across the lifespan. Under this training grant, I plan to receive training
in oral communication, teaching, grant and manuscript writing, programming, and further knowledge of drug
abuse and addiction. My past experiences, my current training plans, and my mentorship team make me the
ideal candidate for receiving an NRSA. I intend to use the opportunities and training provided by this grant to
become a competitive postdoctoral fellow and, eventually, successful independent researcher at a liberal arts
minority-serving institution."

Since approximately 2010, the scale of clinical cancer predisposition genetic testing has increased
dramatically. While a large fraction of sequence variants observed during testing are easily classified as
benign or pathogenic, many others – principally missense substitutions, in-frame indels, and splice junction
variants – are not easily placed on a spectrum from benign to clearly pathogenic. These are termed Variants
of Uncertain Significance (VUS), and the clinical management of families in which they segregate would be
improved if they could actually be classified. Consortium efforts to develop methods for evaluation and
classification of VUS in BRCA1 and BRCA2 date back to a Breast Cancer Information Core satellite meeting
held at the ASHG annual meeting in 2000; and methods that had been developing separately within the breast
cancer, colorectal cancer, melanoma, and Li Fraumeni-syndrome genetics communities were cross-pollinated
at a 2008 International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) working group meeting on VUS in cancer
susceptibility genes. However, neither the qualitative nor the quantitative methods that sprouted from that
meeting produced a generalizable overall approach. In 2015, the American College of Medical Genetics
(ACMG) published guidelines for evaluating VUS across all Mendelian disease susceptibility genes. These
guidelines produced a practical VUS evaluation framework that has been adopted by testing labs and
organizations around the country. However, the ACMG system is entirely qualitative, with evidence weighted
by expert opinion rather than by empirical evidence. Subsequently, we fitted the ACMG system into a
quantitative Bayesian framework, providing a route to replacing qualitative evidence criteria from the ACMG
system with empirically measured counterparts. Indeed, we hypothesize that there will be clear instances
where strength accorded to current ACMG evidence criteria is contradicted by empirical measurement;
correcting these will self-evidently improve the rigor of VUS evaluation. Aim 1 will place related ACMG data
types into larger, logically consistent sets and then reduce or eliminate hidden dependencies between those
sets. Noting that the ACMG variant classification guidelines were almost entirely qualitative, Aim 2 will
improve the rigor of calibration for key data types through empirical measurement. Recently, we derived a
quantitative Bayesian point-system for VUS evaluation and classification, which is back compatible with its
parent quantitative Bayesian framework and the qualitative ACMG variant classification guidelines. Thus Aim
3 will refine this Bayesian point-system, taking advantage of the improved outputs from Aims 1 and 2. Finally,
Aim 4 will benchmark elements of VUS evaluation and classification. Successful completion of these Aims will
improve rigor in the system used for evaluation of VUS in cancer susceptibility genes, enabling higher
throughput VUS evaluation and improving confidence in the resulting classifications."
10812336,"Abstract
Advanced prostate cancer is a universally lethal disease and one for which no biomarkers have yet been found
to inform therapeutic decision making. DNA repair deficiency in the homologous recombination pathway
increases sensitivity of tumors to DNA damaging agents for patients with breast and ovarian cancers. Early
data suggests that the DNA damaging agent carboplatin may be exceptionally effective in DNA repair deficient
prostate cancer. This study would determine if the use of the DNA damaging agent carboplatin is more
effective than docetaxel in homologous recombination deficient prostate cancers in the first line setting and
compare responsiveness to the alternate drug at crossover. The proposed study is a randomized phase II
study of first line carboplatin vs. docetaxel in men with metastatic, castration resistant prostate cancer
containing BRCA1 or BRCA2 or PALB2 mutations after prior therapy with abiraterone and/or enzalutamide and
for whom chemotherapy is considered appropriate. Patients will be treated with first line therapy until
progression, intolerance or 10 cycles. At the time of progression, patients will cross over to the alternative
regimen. The primary endpoint will be progression free survival with the first line therapy (PFS-1L) with
secondary endpoints of progression free survival with second line therapy (PFS-2L) and PFS to both therapies
combined as well as toxicity of each regimen. This study will provide critical information regarding efficacy and
toxicity of carboplatin vs. the standard of care chemotherapy and whether use of DNA targeting agents initially
will provide longer PFS than first line docetaxel. The importance of this study will be to establish the utility of
BRCA and PALB2 as predictive biomarkers for carboplatin and to determine if carboplatin alone is an effective
and safe therapy in men with resistant prostate cancer. The study would also establish whether carboplatin is
appropriate to test in future studies against other agents targeting DNA repair pathway deficiency such as
poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase inhibitors (PARPi). PARPi are very effective in early studies but are expensive
and can be toxic. If this study demonstrates efficacy of carboplatin, randomized cost effectiveness studies vs.
PARPi within the VA would be justified."
10812419,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Every day we make important health decisions – such as whether to exercise or not – that impact health
outcomes, from our physical to mental and cognitive health. Such decisions become all the more
consequential as we age, given increased vulnerabilities in later life including risk for dementia (e.g.,
Alzheimer’s disease). In light of evidence documenting decreased physical activity with advanced age, how
can we promote healthy decision making in late life? The proposed project focuses on socioemotional aspects
of decision making, which may become particularly influential for older adults because of documented
motivational shifts toward positivity and socially meaningful goals. Our previous work has demonstrated that
positive affect plays a critical role in encouraging older adults to exercise. Relatedly, we have found that older
adults are more motivated by social goals to exercise, whereas younger adults are more motivated by
instrumental goals. Drawing from evidence that positive affect is particularly beneficial to mental and physical
health when socially shared, the proposed work will examine how shared positive affect may influence health-
related decisions and behavior. Finally, existing evidence indicates that although older adults generally benefit
from exercise in terms of mental, physical, and cognitive health, genetic risk for dementia moderates the health
benefits of exercise, which will be considered in this project. This research is innovative in its (a) translational
application of insights from affective, cognitive, and aging theory and research to understand the antecedents
and consequences of exercise decision making in younger and older adults, (b) conceptualization of both the
social and emotional aspects of decision making, (c) development of a novel method for message framing that
incorporates social influences, and (d) novel assessments of influences on the exercise-health link. The
proposed research will examine the underlying affective and social mechanisms that play a role in health
decisions and behavior. Specifically, this research will: (1) establish an understanding of how social and
emotional processes contribute to age differences in health-related decision making, (2) determine how social
and emotional factors impact exercise engagement, adherence, and maintenance, and (3) probe how shared
positive affect and genetic risk for dementia may influence the effects of exercise on the health benefits in older
adults. These aims will be met through laboratory experiments, field studies, and intervention studies. By
pursuing these aims, this project promises to increase our understanding of the role of social and emotional
processes in health-related decision making in older and younger adult, and to better inform prescriptive
recommendations for how to best motivate healthy behaviors."
10812420,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Chronic pain is debilitating medical problem that affects millions of people. However, current clinical
therapy relying on opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has limited efficacy because of severe
adverse effects and abuse potential. To overcome these limitations, more in-depth illustration of the
mechanism that underlies the development and maintenance of chronic pain will be extremely helpful. Pain
perception consists of both peripheral and central components. While the peripheral mechanisms of pain
have been well studied, our current understanding of the central mechanism of pain perception, especially
with respect to chronic pain, remains rather limited. The current project focuses on the mechanism by which
anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of the brain participates in pain perception. It has been well-established that
synaptic plasticity in ACC represents one of the most critical mechanisms underlying the transition of pain
from acute to chronic. Using mouse models of chronic pain induced by peripheral inflammatory and spared
nerve injury, the research team has obtained strong evidence that acid-sensing ion channel isoform 1a
(ASIC1a) plays a pivotal role in both the development and maintenance of chronic pain. Not only did ACC
neuron specific ablation of ASIC1a gene mitigated inflammatory hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia, but
in situ pharmacological inhibition of ASIC1a at ACC also quickly reversed the pre-established pain
hypersensitivity. More intriguingly, in situ focal application of an ASIC1a activator at ACC enhanced
sensitivity to peripheral thermal and mechanical stimulation within 10 minutes in the absence of peripheral
inflammation or injury, indicating a crucial role of ACC ASIC1a activity in pain processing. The current
project aims to elucidate the mechanism by which ACC ASIC1a regulates central pain processing at
molecular, cellular and functional levels. The central hypothesis is that in ACC excitatory neurons that
receive persistent nociceptive inputs, ASIC1a, in an ion conduction-independent manner, facilitates
cingulate long-term potentiation through promoting forward trafficking of AMPA receptors. The enhanced
synaptic efficacy in turn leads to altered sensitivity and reactivity of the pain pathways. The two specific aims
are to define molecular underpinnings of ASIC1a regulation of AMPAR trafficking during the course of LTP
induction and expression in ACC excitatory neurons (AIM 1) and illustrate functional relevance of molecular
interactions that control AMPAR trafficking in cingulate LTP and chronic pain (AIM 2). The collaborative
project will combine the unique strengths of the two laboratories in biochemical and cell biological analysis
(US lab) and electrophysiological and behavioral study of plasticity and pain (China lab) to accomplish the
goals. The project will greatly enhance our understanding on mechanism of ASIC1a regulation of synaptic
plasticity, especially as it relates to pain hypersensitivity through enhancing synaptic efficacy at supraspinal
levels, and shed new lights on more effective ways to treat chronic pain with minimal side effects."
10812422,"The experiments described in this proposal address one of the most fascinating unanswered questions in vision
research regarding the molecular mechanisms responsible for photoreceptor outer segment morphogenesis. The
outer segment is a ciliary organelle that produces electrical signals in response to capturing light. A unique
morphological feature of the outer segment is that it is filled with a stack of flattened membrane discs providing vast
surfaces for photon capture and signal amplification. The functional significance of this anatomical arrangement has
been recognized for a very long time, yet our understanding of how discs are built at the molecular level remains
frustratingly rudimentary. This application addresses several poorly understood aspects of photoreceptor disc
morphogenesis, related to the processes of disc expansion, alignment and enclosure. Our preliminary data show
that the edges of newly formed discs contain two distinct types of extracellular links: one connecting discs with the
inner segment plasma membrane and another connecting disc edges between themselves. Experiments described
in Aims 1 and 2 will be devoted to determining the protein composition of each link type and elucidating their
specific roles in supporting the high fidelity of disc elongation and stacking. Aim 3 will focus on the final step in disc
maturation consisting of its scission from the outer segment plasma membrane. We will address whether disc
scission takes place exclusively in rods and explore molecular players involved in this process. Experiments
described in this application will employ versatile molecular tools combined with the state-of-the-art three
dimensional electron microscopy tomographic analysis of the outer segment structure. Addressing these
mechanistic questions is essential for advancing our basic understanding of photoreceptor cell biology, as well as
elucidating the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying inherited blindness frequently associated with defects in
outer segment morphogenesis."
10815780,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The neurobiology of post-stroke sensorimotor recovery is not fully understood. Current research on stroke
recovery focuses on two spatial levels of brain injury: the focal level (i.e., the lesion and brain structures directly
affected by the stroke, such as the corticospinal tract) and the network level (i.e., brain structures distant from
the lesion but affected via diaschisis). This proposal argues that a third level should be considered: global brain
health (GBH), which is defined as the cellular, structural, and vascular integrity of the whole brain. Although GBH
has recently been recognized as a crucial predictor of outcomes in conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease and
traumatic brain injury, its role in stroke recovery is not well understood. Similarly, although focal and network
effects of stroke injury have been well-studied, little is known about how stroke exerts global influences across
the whole brain. The key scientific premise of this research is that (a) GBH modulates the overall neuroplastic
resources that promote stroke recovery and (b) acute stroke injury causes global changes in brain health. The
central hypothesis is that poor GBH is related to poor stroke outcomes, and conversely, that severe acute stroke
injury is related to worsening of GBH. The rationale underlying the proposed research is that establishing GBH
as a meaningful contributor to stroke recovery may stimulate new avenues of research and novel targets for
therapeutic development. GBH will be estimated as indexed by four brain imaging measures linked to brain
health (predicted brain age reflecting structural atrophy, severity of deep white matter hyperintensities,
periventricular hyperintensities, and perivascular spaces). Aim 1 will utilize a large, retrospective stroke
neuroimaging and behavioral database from the ENIGMA Stroke Recovery working group (N=627) to
characterize the relationship between GBH and stroke outcomes in a cross-sectional chronic stroke population.
Aim 2 will use a prospective, multi-site, longitudinal data collection (N=144) in individuals within three weeks and
at three months after stroke to study how initial GBH relates to post-stroke brain repair and sensorimotor
recovery. Aim 3 will use the same prospective dataset (N=144) to examine how the severity of acute stroke
relates to longitudinal changes in GBH between 3 weeks and 3 months. With respect to key findings, we expect
to show that GBH is related to sensorimotor outcomes and predicts the extent of early stroke recovery, and that
GBH evolves in this context. The proposed work is innovative because it opens an entirely new framework in
which to consider sensorimotor recovery after stroke. The results are expected to have an impact because they
will advance our understanding of global influences on stroke recovery, and they will implicate GBH as a novel
therapeutic target for potentiating recovery after stroke."

 ABSTRACT/PROJECT SUMMARY
The overarching goal of the reorganized Biotechnology, Imaging, and Drug Development (BIDD) Program is to
utilize novel computational, chemical, and engineering-based approaches to detect, diagnose, and treat cancer.
The BIDD Program evolved in response to the increasingly interdisciplinary nature of cancer research, spanning
chemistry, physics, mathematics, optics, engineering, biology, and medicine. The Program initiates concepts
through cross-disciplinary meetings at the pre-design phases; progresses through technology development
involving advanced chemistry, physics, and engineering; and proceeds through preclinical validation in model
systems and tissues before testing in clinical trials. The BIDD Program fuses two prior complementary programs
and provides leadership and structure to translate basic discoveries to the clinic. The formation of the Program
synergistically combines UCI's strengths in synthetic chemistry, bioengineering, and physics to maximize
translation of basic research. As the de facto technology development hub for the Cancer Center, BIDD reaches
out to other Cancer Center programs, Catchment Area stakeholders, and the investment community to build
interdisciplinary teams able to steer new technologies into cancer-relevant directions. The BIDD leadership
facilitates this process by establishing interdisciplinary teams of clinicians, physical scientists, and biologists to
guide each project from its earliest stages; assist in the design of validation experiments using appropriate
models (animal models with the Transgenic Mouse Facility, TMF), human tissues through the Experimental
Tissue Resource (ETR), and ex vivo tissue models); implement deep learning approaches for drug and
diagnostics development; provide infrastructure to complete IND-enabling studies; and design clinical trials to
test drug candidates and devices.

 The mHTI will continue to serve as a national resource and educational ecosystem, nurturing the next
generation of integrative scholars able to apply the latest advances in mHealth to the development and
implementation of solutions with practical societal impact. Our virtual collaboratory (mHealthHUB) will enable
and sustain collaborations between geographically dispersed scholars and ensure that the curated didactic
content and Open Educational Resources (OERs) from the annual mHTIs are freely available; thus, expanding
the reach and impact of our educational program and promoting long-term educational sustainability. The
didactic resources of each mHTI will be curated into content clusters to serve as a toolkit for mHTI scholars
seeking to deliver similar mHealth and team science training at their home institutions (Train-the-Trainer). By
continuing to prime the mHealth innovation pipeline with a diverse cadre of self-actualizing, integrative scientists
with transdisciplinary competencies and mindsets, mHTI 3.0 will ensure that the fields of behavioral health and

Women of color have increased rates of cardiometabolic disorders (e.g., cardiovascular disease, diabetes,
hypertension). Although epidemiologic studies demonstrate short sleep duration and poor sleep quality
increase cardiometabolic disease risk, few studies have examined mechanisms of short sleep duration and
poor sleep quality from the perspectives of women of color. This project builds on our team’s collaboration with
Community Faces of Utah, an organization that links the University of Utah and Utah Department of Health
with four local communities of color (Black/African American, Hispanic/Latinx, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander
and African Immigrant/Refugee). Our team previously completed a 12-month community health worker (CHW)
delivered wellness intervention in 485 women that improved diet and physical activity; however, results
indicated sleep was an unmet need (41% reported sleep duration <7 hours but only 12% were interested in
sleep improvement). Our results and others suggest that more research is needed to understand how sleep is
traded off for other responsibilities and demands in the lives of women of color. To address this gap, we are
proposing a community engaged mixed-methods study to advance the understanding of how time use
affects sleep and cardiometabolic disease risk among women of color. Our study will utilize a 3-step
process: In Aim 1, we will begin by collecting qualitative data (focus groups) among CHWs for an in-depth
understanding of how women balance sleep and other demands, both from their perspectives as community
members and as trusted front-line public-health workers; In Aim 2, we will utilize results from the focus groups
to conduct a field study among 400 women of color from the four participating communities to examine the
relationships between time use, sleep, diet, physical activity, and cardiometabolic health and use innovative
statistical modeling techniques to understand the impact of time trade-offs on sleep and cardiometabolic
health; and in Aim 3, we will use an intervention mapping framework to integrate the results of the focus groups
and field study, and plan the next step interventions with our community advisory board. This study is
innovative in exploration of an understudied mechanism in sleep, evaluation of sleep health in populations
often not included in sleep research (Native Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders, African Immigrant/ Refugees), and in
our collaboration with CHWs, front-line public health workers who are underutilized in sleep research. Our
long-standing partnerships support feasibility, usefulness to the community and our ability to rapidly translate
results into interventions to improve sleep and cardiometabolic disease risk among women of color."

Individuals who self-identify as Black in the United States experience disproportionately higher rates of
developing chronic kidney disease (CKD) and experiencing CKD progression to end-stage kidney disease
(ESKD). A portion of this health difference is not explained by socioeconomic and traditional risk factors,
necessitating the study of other biological factors contributing to disease pathogenesis. Human genetics studies
have identified and validated two common coding variants in the primate-specific Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1)
gene that contribute to high rates of proteinuric CKD in patients with African ancestry. These alleles, termed G1
and G2, evolved and became common due to the survival advantage they confer against African
trypanosomiasis. Despite their role in primate innate immunity, not much is known about the role immune cells
such as macrophages, which contribute to kidney injury and repair, play in APOL1 nephropathy.
To address this gap, we propose to use genome-edited induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived
macrophages and transgenic mice to investigate how G1 and G2 APOL1 alter macrophage function to promote
kidney disease. We focus on the macrophage due to its dual role in innate immune responses to pathogens and
contribution to kidney injury and fibrosis. In preliminary studies, we have generated genome-edited G1 iPSCs
sharing an isogenic background with G0 controls and found that G1 iPSC derived macrophages maintain higher
expression of proinflammatory genes under multiple conditions. Because chronic sterile macrophage
inflammation can drive kidney disease, we are investigating mechanisms by which G1 and G2 APOL1 promote
a sustained proinflammatory macrophage phenotype and maladaptive tissue repair. In various complex diseases
including CKD, resolution of tissue inflammation requires anti-inflammatory reprogramming of immune cells and
clearance of apoptotic cells by macrophages via efferocytosis. Additionally, macrophage inflammation can be
induced by stress or dysfunction of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which has been implicated in APOL1 biology
in other cell types. Therefore, we hypothesize that G1 and G2 macrophages undergo impaired anti-inflammatory
reprogramming and inefficient efferocytosis through enhanced ER stress, thereby contributing to non-resolving
kidney inflammation and APOL1 nephropathy. To test this central hypothesis, we will delineate which ER stress
pathways G1 and G2 APOL1 perturb (Aim 1), investigate anti-inflammatory signaling and mitochondrial
dysfunction in the attenuation of reparative reprogramming of G1 and G2 macrophages (Aim 2), and determine
the mechanisms by which G1 and G2 APOL1 impair efferocytosis (Aim 3). The proposed investigations will test
a novel hypothesis that APOL1 risk alleles amplify kidney injury through macrophage dysfunction. Elucidating
the macrophage’s role in APOL1 nephropathy will offer critical insight for developing complementary strategies
to treat APOL1 disease through enhancing macrophage-mediated tissue repair."

Building resources to make data from high value, publicly funded cohort studies widely accessible, (re)usable,
and interoperable is one of the National Institute on Aging's key milestones of the Alzheimer's Disease and
Related Dementia (AD/ADRD) research implementation. The Gateway to Global Aging Data is a data
platform developed to harmonize and disseminate data from the Health and Retirement Study and its
international network of studies (HRS-INS) to facilitate longitudinal analyses on aging across 47 countries.
Expanding on an already successful platform, this application aims to bring in newly available data on late-life
cognition and dementia, collected using the Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol (HCAP), together with
other newly available data from core longitudinal interviews, self-completion questionnaire, Life-History
interviews, End-of-Life interviews, and the special COVID-19 surveys, to promote high-quality studies of late-
life cognition, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD/ADRD. We will also integrate contextual data,
specifically, air pollution exposures, institutional and policy measures related to long-term care and end-of-life
care, and information about the COVID-19 pandemic. Air pollution is a modifiable risk factor for AD/ADRD yet
most research is from individual countries and focused on total particulate pollution. By newly estimating air
pollution from different sources at respondent addresses, we will enable interested researchers to investigate
the effects of exposures on cognitive decline, MCI, and AD/ADRD, across multiple countries. Similarly, the
utilization, cost, and quality of long-term care related to dementia are emerging areas of concern. Thus, we aim
to identify institutional and policy differences in formal long-term, informal, end-of-life, and dementia care for
the respondents of the HRS-INS. Finally, the COVID-19 pandemic has been devastating to older adults though
the full magnitude of its impacts has yet to be understood. Survey data from the HRS-INS can inform the
extent of the damage. As we grow our database with new measures and expand our user base, we seek to
redesign the technical implementation of our metadata extraction, contextual data integration, and data
management and dissemination application. Such investment in data infrastructure is justified when the data
are widely used to produce novel and meaningful new knowledge, insights on population health, including
AD/ADRD and dementia care, and ultimately policy innovations. To facilitate the widespread use of the
Gateway's resources, we will further strengthen user training and support by regularly organizing user
conferences and workshops in addition to our regularly scheduled webinars. By amassing this expansive
platform of high-quality information from the HRS-INS harmonized by subject-area experts, making these data
publically available, and conducting outreach to support use of these data, we anticipate that the Gateway will
lead to impactful discoveries on the risks, care, and costs of AD/ADRD globally."
10820494,"ABSTRACT
The delta cell of the pancreatic islet has been barely investigated despite secreting somatostatin (SST), a
powerful inhibitory peptide that is essential for the homeostasis of different tissues. In the islet, SST inhibits the
secretion of insulin and glucagon, but little is known about the mechanisms that activate delta cell and SST
secretion. No other roles have been investigated or even proposed for the delta cell in islet biology and glucose
metabolism. The nervous system, endocrine organs, and local neighboring cells, including immune cells, could
potentially interact with the delta cell as a “switch” or “brake” to modulate the function of the whole islet. It is clear
that the relevance of this powerful inhibitory component in the islet has been overlooked. The position of the
delta cell as a key element in the regulation of islet hormone secretion needs to be addressed to understand
how islet hormone secretion is regulated. The general hypothesis of this proposal is that the delta cell is a
signaling hub where paracrine, immune and nervous signals converge and are integrated to set the level of SST
secretion that ultimately modulates overall islet activity. This hypothesis will be tested through two related but
not interdependent aims. In Aim 1 we will study the role of GABA as a key paracrine signal in delta cell function.
Our previous results suggest that delta cell function is tightly adjusted by GABA, a paracrine signal secreted by
beta cells through glucose independent mechanisms. GABA could therefore modulate delta cell responses to
other local signals. We will use human islets and, when translatable, mouse islets to determine (1.1) the effects
of endogenous GABA on the magnitude of basal SST secretion, (1.2) the effects of endogenous GABA on delta
cell responses to glucose and other, local signals, and (1.3) how loss of endogenous GABA signaling contributes
to the changes in somatostatin secretion in high BMI and type 2 diabetes. In Aim 2 we will examine the role of
the delta cell and SST signaling in islet inflammation. Our preliminary findings indicate that the delta cell responds
to signals from the immune and neural compartments and secretes SST to counteract inflammation and
neuroinflammation. Thus, the delta cell could protect the islet from unchecked and damaging immune responses.
We will test (2.1) the effects of cytokines and proinflammatory neuropeptides on delta cells, and (2.2) the effect
of SST on local immune cells and sensory nerves. We will use a combination of novel in vitro (isolated islets),
ex vivo (pancreatic tissue slices), and in vivo (intraocular islet grafts) approaches together with pharmacological
tools, optogenetic stimulation, cell ablation, functional imaging and systemic metabolic readouts to study how
delta cells are activated and how they influence the sensory nerves and surrounding endocrine and immune
cells. We expect our studies to further our understanding of the circumstances under which the delta cell is
recruited to influence endocrine and immune cells in the islet. If SST’s role as an immunomodulator is validated,
it is likely that the delta cell will be reconsidered as a key element in the natural history of diabetes. Therefore,
important advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of diabetes could be expected."

 Distinct epigenetic mechanisms, including histone modifications, DNA methylation, chromatin remodeling
and histone variant exchange, collaboratively and dynamically shape local epigenetic landscape and control
gene activities. Alteration of epigenetic pathways and mutations in epigenetic regulators contribute to the
pathogenesis of various human diseases. Several studies suggest that these epigenetic pathways are
orchestrated to regulate activity-gene expression. Current tools to simultaneously manipulate multiple epigenetic
pathways in temporal and locus specific are lacking. Such tools are necessary to precisely dissect the functional
interplays and crosstalk between these distinct epigenetic mechanisms for gene regulation. To address this
limitation, we propose to establish unique chemical inducible methods that integrate dCas9/gRNA-guided
targeting with the orthogonal chemically induced proximity (CIP) technology to simultaneously control different
epigenetic regulations including all major epigenetic pathways. We will focus on the following three aims: (i)
Develop inducible dual editing platforms for diverse histone modifications; (ii) Develop chemical inducible
platforms for chromatin remodeling and nucleosome editing; (iii) Develop chemical inducible editing platforms
for DNA methylation and validate the orthogonal manipulation of multiple mechanisms across distinct epigenetic
pathways. After finishing this work, we expect to establish a unique toolset that can be readily used by
researchers in the field. This platform can be easily adapted and expanded to manipulate new epigenetic factors
not tested in this study. This new epigenome editing/remodeling platform will facilitate the advancement of
epigenetic research and potentially offer new directions in developing new epigenetic-based therapies."

Disease and injury cause a catastrophic loss of cognitive and motor abilities in the nervous system. Preventing
neurodegeneration is critical to maintaining neuronal function. To develop effective treatments, we first need a
greater understanding of the genetic and cellular mechanisms that determine whether the nervous system
degenerates in response to various insults. Caenorhabditis elegans is a highly tractable model to dissect
conserved molecular and cellular mechanisms. The goal of this proposal is to take advantage of the C. elegans
model to identify regulatory mechanisms of axon degeneration. To reach this goal, I will apply my developing
skills in detailed genetic analyses, laser axotomy, imaging, sequencing, and bioinformatics. The impact of this
project is significant. In addition to providing a critical advance in understanding the fundamental mechanisms
of neurodegeneration, it will also inform future therapeutic approaches that can be manipulated to protect the
nervous system from degenerating."

Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is characterized by the extracellular deposition
of parenchymal β-amyloid (Aβ), intracellular accumulation of tau as neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), neuronal
cell loss, and significant inflammation. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), the accumulation of amyloid in
arterial walls, occurs in over 85% of AD cases, positioning CAA as one of the strongest vascular contributors to
age-related cognitive decline. CAA has been associated with an active immune response and perivascular
deposition of hyperphosphorylated tau; yet these three pathological entities have never been linked in relation
with cognitive decline. Our recent studies have contributed to understanding the pathogenesis of CAA and the
preponderant roles that tau, reactive astrocytes and the complement system could play in the synaptotoxicity
associated with vascular amyloid deposition. Considering that there is still no clear understanding of the
molecular and cellular mechanisms and targets that underlie the contribution of CAA to neurodegeneration and
dementia, the main hypothesis of this renewal is that in CAA, there is a distinct group of neurotoxic
C3+ reactive astrocytes which significantly contribute to disease pathogenesis. Moreover, we
propose that reducing tau expression in these astrocytes leads to neuroprotection by
downregulating the complement pathway, resulting in reduced glial reactivity and synaptic loss.
By introducing a series of biochemical, molecular, histological, electrophysiological, behavioral, imaging, and
transcriptomics-based strategies together with novel mouse models and human postmortem tissue, this proposal
will 1. evaluate the neuroprotective effect of blocking C3+ astrocytes conversion on CAA pathogenesis in vivo, 2.
test whether cell-specific ablation of Mapt rescues disease-associated phenotypes in a CAA model in vivo and 3.
determine whether reactive astrocytes associated with vascular amyloid are distinct from astrocytes associated
with parenchymal amyloid deposits in CAA/AD patients, by integrating spatial whole transcriptomic with single
nucleus RNA sequencing.
The proposed studies will continue providing a platform for the understanding the mechanism(s) contributing
to neurodegeneration associated with CAA. Information gained from these studies may lead to the development
of effective therapeutics not only for CAA and AD, but also for a number of neurodegenerative diseases
characterized by the vascular accumulation of amyloid peptides."
10817420,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
ALX4 (Aristaless-like homeobox 4) is a conserved homeodomain transcription factor important for bone, skull, and limb
development. Mutations in ALX4 cause the autosomal dominant disease parietal foramina 2 (PFM2) and the autosomal
recessive disease frontonasal dysplasia 2 (FND2), and autosomal dominant variants in ALX4 are associated with an
increased risk for craniosynostosis 5 (CRS5). Despite its important role in development and association with rare human
diseases, ALX4 is an understudied protein with limited biochemical/cellular, biophysical, and structural characterization,
which limits our understanding of ALX4 function under normal physiological and human disease contexts, such as PFM2,
FND2, and CRS5. The overall goal of this proposal is to purify and characterize WT and disease associated ALX4 variants
using (1) X-ray crystallography to solve its high-resolution structure, (2) biochemical/biophysical approaches, such as
electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), to analyze its binding interactions
with DNA, and (3) luciferase assays to assess their transcriptional regulatory properties. Our preliminary data supports the
hypothesis that these variants negatively affect ALX4 interactions with DNA and/or cooperative binding, which underlies
the pathophysiologic basis of these variants in PFM2, FND2, and CSR5. To test our hypothesis and achieve our goal, we
will pursue the following two experimental aims – Aim1: Purify and determine high-resolution structures of ALX4 and
Aim2: Characterize the DNA binding and regulatory properties of WT ALX4 and disease variants. Completion of this
proposal will provide a deeper understanding of ALX4 structure and function for both WT and disease associated variants
that map to its HD. Moreover, completion of this pilot project grant will lay the groundwork for subsequent collaborative
studies that characterize ALX4 function in human development and disease using a multidisciplinary approach, combining
structural and in vitro biophysical and biochemical/cellular studies with organoid and mouse models of ALX4."

The average smoker will attempt to quit smoking at least 30 times before abstaining for 12 months or longer.
These attempts typically occur over decades of smoking, carcinogen and toxicant exposure, resulting in 480,000
deaths annually. As highlighted in the Surgeon General’s Report, helping smokers who cannot quit smoking
switch to less harmful non-combustible nicotine-containing products, such as e-cigarettes, has the potential to
reduce this health burden dramatically. Substituting e-cigarettes for combustible cigarettes might only be
possible for persistent smokers if e-cigarettes are accessible and appealing. Harm reduction proponents have
advocated for the continued availability of e-cigarette flavors to appeal to and aid cigarette smokers unable to
quit with traditional methods. Yet, there are no prospective studies of the effect of flavor on initial and
sustained switching from combustible to electronic cigarettes. Converging laboratory, epidemiological, and
clinical research suggests that fruit-flavored e-cigarettes with nicotine may be a viable substitute for combustible
cigarettes among persistent smokers. The proposed study seeks to answer two novel questions relevant to
public health and the regulation of e-cigarette flavoring. First, do persistent smokers substitute fruit-flavored e-
cigarettes more readily than traditional-flavored e-cigarettes (tobacco or menthol) for combustible cigarettes?
Second, are fruit-flavored e-cigarettes more rewarding and reinforcing than traditional-flavored e-cigarettes, and
do these effects facilitate switching? The proposed research will fill these gaps in the evidence base by
randomizing 210 persistent cigarette smokers to a six-week regimen of fruit-flavored (FF: watermelon and
blueberry, n=70), tobacco-flavored (TF n=70) or menthol-flavored (MF n=70) e-cigarettes in a between-subjects
design. Baseline smoking rate will be established during days 1-5. After biochemically verified overnight cigarette
smoking abstinence, laboratory visits on days 6 and 7 will assess flavor-associated subjective reward and the
reinforcing value of flavored e-cigarettes relative to combustible cigarettes. Participants will then switch from
cigarette smoking to e-cigarette use for six weeks. Participants will collect spent cigarette filters daily to assess
cigarettes smoked per day (cpd) if they smoke. The primary outcome measure is the longitudinal daily count of
cigarettes from baseline to the end of the six-week switch period, with cigarettes per day at a 6-month follow-up
as a secondary endpoint. This study aligns with NCI priorities outlined in the Notice of Special Interest
(NOSI NOT-OD-22-023) for research on “how ENDS use influences smoking (e.g., quit attempts,
sustained abstinence, relapse).”"

Development of novel contraceptive strategies is central to the mission of the Contraceptive Research Branch
of the NICHD. This goal is driven by a global need for effective contraceptive methods to address: 1) the glut of
unintended pregnancies (~45% of US pregnancies in 2011); 2) the high rate of elective abortion (1.15M
unintended pregnancies ended in abortion in 2011 in the US); and 3) the high risk of maternal mortality (~830
women/day worldwide die due to pregnancy or childbirth complications). In a search for novel male contraceptive
drug targets, we identified RBM46, which is a germ cell-specific RNA binding protein expressed by germ cells
on the basement membrane of seminiferous tubules (outside the blood-testis-barrier), and is essential for
spermatogenesis. Indeed, Rbm46 knockout mice are sterile and have no other phenotype, raising the distinct
possibility that targeting RBM46 could lead to safe and effective male contraception by blocking spermatogenesis
at the differentiating spermatogonial stage. Thus, we propose to develop drugs that target degradation of RBM46
as a means of oral, non-hormonal male contraception, which will significantly advance additional safe and
reversible options for male contraception towards the clinic. Specifically, we will combine: 1) exceptional
expertise in drug screening and development at UTSA and UT Health San Antonio; 2) leading expertise in male
reproduction, spermatogenesis, and infertility at UTSA and ECU; 3) close proximity to one of two NIH-designated
Marmoset Breeding Colonies, maintained at the Southwest National Primate Research Center; 4) growing and
ongoing experience collecting and assessing marmoset sperm; 5) published experience in the use of cutting-
edge single-cell genomics to assess normality of spermatogenic cell types; and 6) documented expertise with
spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) transplantation. In Aim 1, we will identify small molecules that bind RBM46 and
could be used to develop PROTACs. In Aim 2, we will produce initial RBM46 PROTACs and validate that they
degrade the protein in vitro. In Aim 3, we will use medicinal chemistry to optimize the drug-like characteristics of
top validated RBM46 PROTACs. In Aims 4 and 5, we will determine whether optimized RBM46 PROTACs induce
reversible contraception in vivo using mice and marmosets, respectively. Together, these Aims are designed to
advance RBM46 degradation as a novel strategy to achieve reversible, non-hormonal male contraception and
provide key results to justify further preclinical investigation and eventual commercialization."

 As a young, rapidly growing campus in North San Diego County, California State University San Marcos
(CSUSM) is well-positioned to prepare motivated students from underrepresented (UR) groups for graduate
studies and research careers. A large proportion of CSUSM students is Hispanic (47%), which exceeds the
non-Hispanic White population (26%). The campus is both a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) and an Asian
American, Native American and Pacific Islander-Serving Institution (AANAPISI). In addition, 54% are from
families in which they will be the first to complete a college degree and 48% are Pell Grant recipients. Thus,
CSUSM is home to a rapidly growing diverse student body, many of whom are low income and/or the first in
their family to attend college.
 We’ve specifically developed our program to meet the needs of the student population at CSUSM. The
program will use evidence-based practices to achieve the following 8 objectives: 1) to prepare, recruit and
select U-RISE scholars who show significant promise for success; 2) to assure strong academic performance;
3) to enhance quantitative and methodological skills; 4) to enhance scientific communication skills; 5) to
engage students in biomedical research; 6) to develop knowledge, skills and persistence necessary to succeed
in a doctoral program and beyond; 7) to expose students to a culturally validated pedagogy to increase
belonging and persistence; and 8) to prepare competitive applications for graduate school. A capstone project,
to prepare a graduate research fellowship proposal will utilize many of the skills learned by the scholars. The
program is two years in length. We propose to engage 20 undergraduate students in year 1 of the program, 22
in year 2, and 24 in years 3-5.
 Our major goals, informed by past success rates, are for 90% of CSUSM U-RISE Scholars to enter the
PhD pathway in the biomedical and behavioral sciences, and 65% to enter PhD programs. Taken as a whole,
the U-RISE at CSUSM Program, in concert with a highly supportive campus environment, will prepare students
from UR groups to be thoughtful scientists who have the knowledge, skills, research experience and character
that prepare them for doctoral studies in the biomedical and behavioral sciences and that allow them to
become future leaders in science and academia. By doing this we will help advance the goals of the National
Institutes of Health to diversify the research workforce. A more diverse research workforce will better address
the research needs of a diverse nation and thereby contribute to better health for all."

Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) is the largest long-term study of brain development and child
health in the United States. The ABCD Research Consortium consists of 21 research sites across the country,
a Coordinating Center, and a Data Analysis and Informatics Resource Center. In its first five years, under
RFA-DA-15-015, ABCD enrolled a diverse sample of 11,878 9-10 year olds from across the consortium, and
will track their biological and behavioral development through adolescence into young adulthood.
All participants received a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging,
neuropsychological testing, bioassays, careful assessment of substance use, mental health, physical health,
and culture and environment. A similar detailed assessment recurs every 2 years. Interim in-person annual
interviews and mid-year telephone or mobile app assessments provide refined temporal resolution of
developmental changes and life events that occur over time with minimal burden to participating youth and
parents. Intensive efforts are made to keep the vast majority of participants involved with the study through
adolescence and beyond, and retention rates thus far are very high. Neuroimaging has expanded our
understanding of brain development from childhood into adulthood. Using this and other cutting-edge
technologies, ABCD can determine how different kinds of youth experiences (such as sports, school
involvement, extracurricular activities, videogames, social media, unhealthy sleep patterns, and vaping)
interact with each other and with a child’s changing biology to affect brain development and social, behavioral,
academic, health, and other outcomes.
Data, securely and privately shared with the scientific community, will enable investigators to: (1) describe
individual developmental pathways in terms of neural, cognitive, emotional, and academic functioning, and
influencing factors; (2) develop national standards of healthy brain development; (3) investigate the roles and
interaction of genes and the environment on development; (4) examine how physical activity, sleep, screen
time, sports injuries (including traumatic brain injuries), and other experiences influence brain development; (5)
determine and replicate factors that influence mental health from childhood to young adulthood; (6)
characterize relationships between mental health and substance use; and (7) specify how use of substances
such as cannabis, alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine affects developmental outcomes, and how neural, cognitive,
emotional, and environmental factors influence the risk for adolescent substance use."

The toxic metal cadmium (Cd) is one of the top ten chemicals of major public health concern identified by the
World Health Organization. Cd exerts toxic effects on the kidneys, respiratory and skeletal systems, and long-
term exposure is associated with metabolic, cardiovascular and behavioral disorders. We and others have
shown that exposure to Cd during early life can lead to disease in adulthood. One of these diseases is non-
alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), characterized by fat accumulation, inflammation and tissue damage in
the liver. NAFLD affects 30-40 % of the US adult population, and patients with NAFLD have a higher risk of
developing liver cancer. The broad, long-term objectives of this project are to understand the mechanisms that
link early life Cd exposure to NAFLD in adulthood, and to use this knowledge to develop strategies that can
prevent or reverse this disease. To this end, we have collected data from pregnant women and their children in
North Carolina and demonstrated that DNA isolated from newborn cord blood carries molecular `signatures' of
Cd exposure. We propose that these signatures play an important role in Cd-induced NAFLD. In the current
proposal, we will use mouse and cell culture models to test this hypothesis, and determine how events at the
molecular level lead to disease. We propose three specific aims: 1) determine whether the molecular
signatures associated with Cd that we observe in humans cause changes to the activity of a set of genes
called imprinted genes, which play important roles in liver metabolism; 2) understand how changes to imprinted
gene activity lead to NAFLD; and 3) determine whether Cd could cause NAFLD solely through influencing the
activity of these genes. We aim to demonstrate that imprinted genes play a central role in linking early life Cd
exposure to NAFLD in adulthood, thereby identifying potential markers of disease susceptibility and providing
opportunities for treatment prior to disease onset."

common disabling conditions in children. The major ocular diseases are caused by the retinal chronic
progressive neurodegeneration and unfortunately are irreversible and incurable, thus the early diagnosis of
ocular diseases is crucial for clinician to provide retinoprotection. Recent advances in ophthalmological
imaging and high throughput genotyping and sequencing techniques provide exciting new opportunities to
ultimately improve our understanding of ocular diseases, their genetic architecture, and their influences on
endophenotype and function. However, existing studies of genetics and retinal images are only conducted
separately, wasting the opportunity to explore the interplay between genetics and retinal images. Therefore,
there is a critical need for new machine learning and scientific advances to reveal genetic basis of retinal
imaging endophenotypes and to synergize genetics and imaging for understanding disease progression. We
propose to conduct the novel retinal imaging genetics research to integratively study both retinal images and
genetic data for automated ocular disease diagnosis and prognosis, genetic association study of
endophenotype, and disease progression prediction. Our group has performed pioneering research on retinal
genetics, prediction, and image analysis, therefore we are in a unique position to achieve these goals.
Specifically, we will investigate the following aims: 1) build efficient data integration models to integrate
retinal imaging genetics data from multiple sources; 2) develop knowledge guided learning models for
identifying nonlinear associations among high-dimensional retinal imaging genetics data; 3) detect the
longitudinal interrelations in retinal data utilizing temporal deep learning model; 4) new robust fair metric
learning model to unify the disease prediction and fair metric selection; 5) apply and validate the proposed
machine learning methods to large-scale retinal imaging genetics data from multiple independent cohorts. The
successful completion of this proposal will produce cutting-edge machine learning tools to facilitate
automated disease diagnosis and accurate long-term prediction of disease development and progression
trajectory, which will enhance the early prevention and current clinical management of the disease and will
provide insights for novel precision treatment development."

Increases in cancer incidence and rising cancer costs highlight the need to advance cancer biology through the
growth of a well-trained workforce. Almost all human cancers have alterations in signaling pathways associated
with DNA damage response and oncogenic signaling, and such pathways are also the focus of targeted therapies
already in the clinic and under development. To train the next generation of cancer researchers, we have
developed an institution-wide cancer biology training program for postdoctoral fellows focused on this area of
cancer research, called the DNADRS program. This program is housed at the City of Hope, an NCI-designated
Comprehensive Cancer Center, which is known internationally for clinical cancer research and has an
outstanding record of basic cancer research. This T32 program began in 2016, and this is the first renewal
application. The 3 T32-supported postdoctoral trainees supported for up to 3 years are selected for the DNADRS
program through a rigorous process, including a personal interview. Each trainee establishes a mentoring
committee that includes a physician to foster cross-pollination of ideas between the basic and translational
aspects of cancer research. Annual reappointment is based on annual written reports from the trainee and
mentoring committee. As part of a recruitment incentive in the DNADRS program, City of Hope will continue to
provide an additional postdoctoral trainee position for every underrepresented minority trainee recruited, up to a
total of 6 positions. Furthermore, to attract the best postdoctoral candidates at a national level, City of Hope
continues to commit to salary supplementation for all DNADRS trainees, a stipend for research supplies, and full
administrative and faculty salary support. Trainees will be mentored by 18 faculty members, all of whom are
performing cancer-focused high-impact research and have a history of mentoring postdoctoral fellows. To
enhance their chances of developing into independent cancer researchers, all DNADRS trainees take a unique
common curriculum that provides a continuum of learning including scientific coursework that includes ethical
conduct of research and proper research design, as well as professional development courses. In addition,
trainees participate in cutting-edge research programs, journal clubs, seminars, symposiums, regular luncheons
with mentors, mentoring committee meetings, national and international scientific conferences, and finally a
yearly DNADRS Symposium. The stellar and comprehensive Shared Resource Facilities associated with the
Cancer Center provide training in state-of the art technologies. The request for funding to renew this research
training grant is justified by our track-record from the last funding cycle of seven successful trainees that include
three underrepresented minority fellows, the relevance of the research training to cancer, the experience of the
mentors, the outstanding commitment of City of Hope, and the diverse population of the geographical area
served by our institution."

10819167,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Shared decision-making is a process aimed at helping health care providers and their patients make informed
health decisions. During this process, information is exchanged (patients inform doctors about their health issues
and preferences and health care providers inform patients about options for treatment), and options that will
ultimately lead to a decision regarding management are clarified. Regarding cancer treatment decisions, patients
often have other comorbidities, which can result in increased treatment-related toxicity or decreased benefits
because of competing risk of other diseases. These concerns make decision-making both emotionally and
cognitively difficult. One such difficult decision is whether to use immunotherapy as adjuvant therapy—
specifically, immune checkpoint inhibitors—in patients with resectable melanoma and pre-existing autoimmune
disease. Checkpoint inhibitors can cause adverse events due to immune-mediated tissue damage, termed
immune-related adverse events. In patients with cancer and pre-existing autoimmune disease, immune
checkpoint inhibition is possible but is associated with an increase incidence of adverse events and flares. Thus,
this treatment requires cautious monitoring.
Optimal treatment decisions require careful consideration of harms and benefits as well as the likelihood of
recurrence. The overall goal of this proposed study is to develop and test an individualized shared decision-
making tool for patients with resectable melanoma and pre-existing autoimmune disease that can be used with
providers to improve the decision-making regarding initiation of adjuvant treatment with immune checkpoint
inhibitors. Such tools have yet to be developed.
This career development award will provide the principal investigator with protected time to become a decision
scientist with an interest in shared decision-making by patients with cancer and comorbid conditions. The specific
aims of her research proposal are to evaluate the benefits and risks of immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients
with resectable melanoma and pre-existing autoimmune disease considering stage, survival, expected rates of
toxicity, and flares; 2) to develop a multicomponent shared decision-making tool for cancer patients with RA
considering treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors; and 3) evaluate the tool which will be appropriate for
low-literacy populations, and will be tailored to patients' individual characteristics. To achieve her career goals,
the principal investigator has assembled a multidisciplinary team of experts in the fields of interest and is
proposing a comprehensive training program."
10923981,"PROJECT 1 - ABSTRACT
 The purpose of the Industrialization Project, and of the entire P50 CRC program, is to develop an
antibody-based, woman-controlled contraceptive. This proposal is part of a long-term project to develop and
commercialize an antibody-based contraceptive (stand alone product), and a multipurpose prevention
technology (MPT) that includes a contraceptive monoclonal antibody (mAb) as well as mAbs against sexually
transmitted diseases. Two previous NICHD/NIAID grants supported manufacturing and clinical testing of
intravaginal films that were stages in the developmental pathway to an MPT. In the first grant we developed
MB66, a vaginal film that contained monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against HIV and HSV. The Phase 1 clinical
trial of MB66 showed that it was safe and well tolerated, and that vaginal samples collected up to 24 hours
after MB66 insertion significantly neutralized both HIV-1 and HSV-2 ex vivo. The second grant funded an
ongoing proof-of-concept trial of ZB-06, a film that contains HCA, a monoclonal antibody that targets CD52g,
a male reproductive tract glycoprotein. CD52g coats sperm, and when HCA binds to CD52g it results in
agglutination and mucus trapping of sperm. Preliminary results from the ongoing trial of the ZB-06 indicate
that it is effective at drastically decreasing the number of progressively motile sperm that reach the upper
cervix when administered ~30 minutes prior to intercourse (a post-coital test, PCT).
 The ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of ZB-06 was carried out under an exploratory IND that allowed us
to test the the surrogate efficacy of ZB-06, but was not a standard safety Phase 1. Given the positive surrogate
efficacy results from the ongoing study, we now propose to carry out the Phase 1 safety trial required for
further development of ZB-06 and a dose ranging Phase 2 study. Project 1 will be responsible for the
manufacture of the HCA Drug Substance (DS) and ZB-06 Drug Product (DP), the IND enabling toxicology
studies of ZB-06, and regulatory and quality support for the manufacturing and clinical trial. While HCA DS
and ZB-06 DP were manufactured previously for the proof of concept Phase 1, the Drug Product manufacture
was done at lab scale. We will now develop a commercializable ZB-06 manufacturing process; the
manufacturing, release testing and stability programs will take advantage of (and be de-risked by) our
previous experience with MB66 and ZB-06, including FDA guidance. Similarly, our nonclinical toxicology
program is based on our previous experience with MB66 and ZB-06. Finally, the ZabBio team will provide
regulatory and quality oversight for this project as they have done for the two previous trials, and pursue
commercialization of an antibody-based contraceptive."
10923983,"PROJECT 2 - ABSTRACT
Our team developed a non-hormonal, on-demand, female-controlled, non-surfactant, contraceptive vaginal film
that releases an innovative human contraceptive antibody (HCA). The HCA film could fill an important gap in
the current contraceptive method mix for women worldwide. Project 2 will conduct two United States Food and
Drug Administration (US FDA) required clinical studies, which will build upon progress made in our ongoing
award (NICHD P50 HD096957). Under an exploratory investigational new drug protocol, Eastern Virginia
Medical School (EVMS) (PI Thurman) is currently conducting the first-in-human, post coital testing (PCT),
pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety study (ClinicalTrials.gov #NCT04731818) of a single, 20 mg dose of the HCA
film, inserted 30 minutes prior to unprotected intercourse at peak ovulation. Current data support that the 20 mg
film is safe and acceptable for both the woman and her male sexual partner. All product use PCT data thus far
support contraceptive efficacy, showing less than 5 progressively motile sperm (PMS) per high powered field
(hpf) in ovulatory cervical mucus (mean = 0.05 PMS/hpf, n= 7 women). Specific Aim 1: The operations planning,
technical content generation, site training, and local regulatory filings to prepare for the next clinical trials will
begin immediately. Specific Aim 2: We will conduct a Phase I, Placebo-Controlled, Double-Blinded, Randomized,
Interventional, Safety and PK study of Single and Multiple Dosings of the HCA 20 mg film at EVMS. This study
will include FDA required safety assessments and also innovative assays which quantify sub-clinical changes
relevant to topical vaginal product safety. Specific Aim 3: We will conduct a Phase 2a, multi-center [EVMS and
University of Texas at San Antonio (UT Health)], dose finding (5 mg vs. 10 mg vs. 20 mg), PK study of the HCA
film. We will use an adaptive study design, starting with the lowest dose. The PCT endpoint will be used as an
in vivo surrogate of contraceptive efficacy. We will examine a range of pre-coital dosing time frames (15 min –
4 hours) to assure that this product fits in to the lifestyles of future end users. Project 2 will be closely integrated
with Project 1 and its lead institution, ZabBio, who will provide the active and placebo films, and monitoring and
auditing of the clinical studies. Likewise, Project 2 will interface closely with the Administrative Core at Boston
University, which will provide data management and statistical support. Clinical samples from Project 2 studies
will be analyzed by Project 3; the Boston University lab will use innovative assays to quantify the effect of 14-
day dosing on sub-clinical mucosal safety signals (epithelial barrier quality, sub-clinical pro-inflammatory
proteins) and to describe any changes in the vaginal microbiome with film use. Samples from both clinical
studies will be analyzed by Project 3 to confirm that HCA film use does not elicit the development of endogenous
anti-sperm immunity locally or systemically. The study will deliver important data from two FDA required studies,
which will position this product for Phase 3 efficacy testing and commercialization."
10923992,"PROJECT SUMMARY - Researcher Career Enhancement Project 
The Southcentral Foundation (SCF) Research Department (RD) has conducted community-based participatory 
research (CBPR) addressing health priorities identified by the Alaska Native and American Indian (ANAI) 
community and leadership for the last 14 years. Moving forward, the SCF RD needs to continue fostering 
foundational research skills, such as basic statistical methods, in developing and new staff. Aligning with SCF's 
reputation as a leader in healthcare delivery, we also propose career enhancement activities that will build 
new, advanced research capacity among SCF senior researchers in dissemination and implementation (D&I) 
research, the study of how effective interventions and practices are implemented, adopted, and maintained. 
Within this Researcher Career Enhancement Project, the SCF RD will partner with established partners and 
subject matter experts at University of Washington (UW) to accomplish two specific aims: 1) Improve the 
acquisition of targeted foundational research skills through group-based didactic training paired 
with ongoing mentoring by academic partners and local peer mentors; and 2) Build organizational 
capacity to collaboratively design and conduct integrated, synergistic quality improvement, evaluation, 
and research efforts using dissemination and implementation research frameworks. 
Didactic learning groups in Specific Aim 1 will be selected using the Clinical Research Appraisal Inventory, 
modified for use in the SCF RD during a previous NARCH, and informed by mentor feedback. On-the-job 
application of foundational research skills within SCF research projects, as well as peer mentor support, will 
facilitate learning and ensure cultural and organizational fit. Specific Aim 2 will involve SCF senior researchers 
(i.e. principal investigators) and other SCF staff integral to evaluating SCF improvement efforts – improvement 
advisors (IAs) and program evaluators (PEs). UW D&I experts will provide didactic instruction and use case 
studies to facilitate pragmatic, applied discussion. Teams of senior researchers, IAs, and PEs will then develop 
and carry out integrated improvement, evaluation, and research projects focused on one to two implementation 
efforts in the SCF healthcare system. 
These efforts will enable the SCF RD to continue conducting tribal health research in a culturally, scientifically, 
and ethically sound manner. Furthermore, by fostering the skills to develop and conduct D&I research and 
generate evidence about the implementation of effective interventions in a tribal health system, this effort will 
advance the NARCH goal of increasing tribal control of research and improving ANAI health outcomes."
10923997,"PROJECT SUMMARY – RP2 
Smoking prevalence among Alaska Native and American Indian (ANAI) residents of Alaska is far greater than 
the national average and more than double that of White Alaskans (37% vs. 17%). The estimated health 
burden to the ANAI population nationally is staggering, with rates of smoking attributable deaths among ANAI 
people being 60% higher than for White people. Despite concerted efforts by tribal health organizations and 
the State of Alaska health department, current smoking cessation strategies have not reduced smoking 
prevalence among ANAI people in the last decade. We propose to refine and assess the acceptability and 
feasibility of a metabolism-informed smoking cessation intervention to improve tobacco cessation treatment for 
ANAI people. The goal of this project is to examine the acceptability and feasibility of using nicotine metabolite 
ratio to inform selection of pharmacologic treatment to increase smoking abstinence among ANAI people. 
In clinical practice, the choice of first-line treatment may depend largely on cost, side effect profile, physician 
familarity, pharmacy availability, and patient preference. Recently, a genetically informed biomarker, nicotine 
metabolite ratio, has shown promise to select optimal pharmacologic treatment among non-ANAI populations 
who desire to quit smoking. This study found that patients with slow nicotine metabolism had similar response 
to varenicline and NRT, while those with normal metabolism responded better to varenicline. No prior work has 
piloted implementation of using metabolic markers for treatment selection among ANAI people. We will use a 
community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach to refine a metabolism-informed care model 
described by Wells et al. that has nurse tobacco specialists provide a medication recommendation. We will 
then beta-test the refined intervention in clinic, make additional refinements, and assess the refined 
intervention in a single-arm pilot trial with 40 ANAI participants. We will identify factors that impede or facilitate 
implementation of the refined intervention in the Alaska Native tribal health system using the RE-AIM (Reach, 
Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) and CFIR (Consolidated Framework of Implementation 
Research) implementation frameworks. 
The Specific Aims are to: 1) Refine and beta-test a metabolism-informed pharmacologic intervention to 
optimize design and participation, 2) Conduct a single-arm pilot trial assessing the acceptability and feasibility 
of the refined intervention, and 3) Examine factors which impede or facilitate implementation of the intervention 
within the Alaska Native tribal health system. The proposed project will contribute important knowledge to the 
scant literature on effective tobacco cessation interventions among ANAI people in real-world settings. These 
activities will also build a solid foundation for a larger, pragmatic trial, with potential applicability in tribal health 
systems across the nation."
10924047,"The goal of the Administrative Core is to provide budgetary and administrative support to the other 4 cores and
4 projects in the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study (DPPOS) Alzheimer’s Disease (AD)/AD related
dementias (ADRD) Project. The Administrative Core will support the governance structure of the DPPOS
AD/ADRD Project, and will interact with leadership at the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and other national AD
and ADRD research and research education programs. The DPPOS has a well-developed organization that has
conducted ground-breaking research in pre-diabetes (preD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) over more than 25 years,
supporting 25 clinical sites and multiple reading centers across the United States. The success of this
organization is best reflected by the high level of retention of clinical centers and participants; assiduous
adherence to the study protocol; hundreds of publications in high impact journals; and the development of T2D
prevention guidelines and programs based on DPPOS findings that have been adopted widely, including by the
Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services. The DPPOS working committees and subcommittees will remain
largely intact, with the AD/ADRD Project’s Executive Committee, Steering committee, Publications and
Presentations Committee, and Ancillary Studies Committee continuing into the proposed funding period under
the Administrative Core. The leadership of the Administrative Core will be the same as for the overall project
using a multiple principal investigator (PI) arrangement, shared by PIs Luchsinger, Nathan, and Temprosa. PI
Nathan has been the chair of the DPPOS since its inception. PI Temprosa has been the leader of the DPPOS
coordinating center based at George Washington University. Contact PI Luchsinger has led the Cognitive
Coordinating Center of DPPOS since 2009, has co-led its Working Group on Aging, and has led NIA funded
AD/ADRD research and education programs for 20 years. The Administrative Core (AC) will achieve its goals
through the following specific aims: (1). Support the governance structure of the proposed U19; (2) Support all
cores and projects logistically and financially; (3) Ensure administrative and regulatory compliance; (4) Support
dissemination and collaboration; (5) Support mentorship and career development in T2D and AD/ADRD
research; (6) To evaluate the success of the proposed research program through measurable goals and

10814886,"Project summary
 Bacteria have evolved complex strategies to compete and communicate with one another. One
important mechanism of inter-bacterial competition is contact-dependent growth inhibition (CDI). CDI systems
are found in a wide variety of Gram-negative bacteria, including many important human pathogens. CDI is
mediated by the CdiB/CdiA family of two-partner secretion proteins. CdiB is an Omp85 outer-membrane
protein that is required for the export and assembly of the CdiA exoprotein onto the cell surface. CdiA binds to
receptors on susceptible bacteria and then delivers its C-terminal toxin domain (CdiA-CT) into the target cell.
These systems also encode CdiI immunity proteins, which specifically bind to the CdiA-CT and neutralize toxin
activity to protect CDI+ cells from auto-inhibition. CdiA-CT/CdiI sequences are highly variable, with >130
distinct toxin/immunity protein sequence types recognized in bacterial genomes. CdiA-CT toxins are modular
and can be exchanged between CdiA proteins to generate functional chimeras. These observations indicate
that many different kinds of toxic cargo can be delivered into the cytoplasm of target bacteria. This application
seeks to determine the molecular and structural underpinnings that enable this remarkable functional plasticity.
We will use a combination of genetic, biochemical and biophysical approaches to gain mechanistic insight into
the network of protein-protein interactions that govern CDI. This research will significantly increase our
understanding of the ecology and evolution of bacterial pathogens and could inform novel strategies for
antimicrobial therapy."
10808055,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The complexity of microbial communities inhabiting the healthy human skin have been illuminated in recent
years, as well as signatures associated with inflammatory skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis. However,
the molecular and biochemical mechanisms that mediate microbial symbiosis with the skin are not well
understood. We recently found that homeostatic skin barrier function, epidermal differentiation, and recovery
from injury are dependent on the microbiota in mice. These effects were mediated by the keratinocyte aryl
hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). The AHR is a ligand-dependent xenobiotic receptor of foreign/toxic substances
that is also known to regulate epidermal differentiation, tight junction/adhesion, and antimicrobial innate
immune responses. The objective of this project is to identify and characterize microbial ligands of the AHR,
and to test their utility in treating skin barrier dysfunction and infection. Epidermal barrier dysfunction is a key
feature of atopic dermatitis, a common skin disorder characterized by chronic and relapsing, itchy, inflamed,
skin lesions and dysbiotic microbiota. To test the hypothesis that commensal bacteria mediate AHR signaling
to promote skin barrier integrity and defense, we propose three aims. 1) Define microbial mechanisms of
keratinocyte AHR regulation that promote barrier repair; 2) Establish pharmacodynamic actions of microbial
AHR ligands to promote skin barrier function and antimicrobial defense; and 3) Evaluate microbial AHR ligands
in treatment of epidermal barrier dysfunction and S. aureus infection in murine models. Findings from these
studies will provide novel, accessible targets to promote skin barrier function and repair, while advancing
fundamental understanding of cutaneous host-microbiota interactions."
10808083,"Summary
 Amblyopia is a visual impairment due to the disruption of binocular vision during early childhood. This
disorder affects the function of fine-scale structures within visual cortex, such as ocular dominance columns in
the striate visual cortex (V1) and neural columns that comprise magno- and parvo-cellular streams within visual
area V2, V3, V3A, V4 and MT. This developmental disorder leads to a variety of perceptual impairments from
2D spatial distortion, to decreased acuity in 3D perception and abnormal global motion perception.
 Amblyopia is one of the most common visual disorders, affecting approximately 3% of the world’s
population (i.e. 10 million people in the US alone). Despite the high prevalence of amblyopia and its severe
impact on visual perception, our knowledge of its impact on visual cortical processing is largely limited to
findings based on invasive techniques (e.g. single cell recordings) in animals. This is mainly due to technical
limitations (e.g. low spatial resolution) of conventional neuroimaging techniques, commonly used in human
studies, compared to the size of those cortical structures affected by amblyopia.
 However, with recent advances in high-resolution neuroimaging techniques, based on using ultra-high field
scanners, it is now possible to localize and study functional properties of the fine-scale cortical structures,
affected by amblyopia, in humans non-invasively. Using these advanced techniques, we have already provided
one of the few direct in vivo evidence for ocular dominance columns in human V1 (Nasr and Tootell, 2016) and
depth- (Nasr et al., 2016; Nasr and Tootell, 2016) and color-sensitive (Nasr et al., 2016; Tootell and Nasr,
2017; Nasr and Tootell, 2018) neural columns within human extrastriate visual areas. These findings, plus our
preliminary results enclosed with this proposal suggest that, by taking advantage of these modern
neuroimaging techniques, neural impairments underlying amblyopia can be revealed and scrutinized directly in
humans with a spatial scale comparable to animal studies.
 During the course of this project, we will use the cutting-edge high resolution neuroimaging technology
available to us in the Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging to reveal impacts of amblyopia on visual system.
The results of this project not only fundamentally change the scale at which we can understand the neural
mechanisms underlying amblyopia in human, but also 1) introduces new biomarkers that can be potentially
used for amblyopia classification and 2) provides new tools to assess effectiveness of amblyopia treatments
which are still debated in the absence of any physiological evidence."
10808084,"Stem cells are necessary for tissue homeostasis, and are often localized to specialized niches that
control their function. In this manner, niches control virtually all aspects of stem cell dynamics, and
these properties of stem cells are essential to tissue maintenance. Recent work has shown that
precise cellular architecture is important in order for a niche to communicate with fidelity to the stem
cells it controls. A major issue is that the field does not understand how niches are initially formed in a
tissue, nor the key cell biological steps that constitute stem cell dynamics., and how these are
regulated by niche signals. Our lab made significant advances on these questions over the past five
years of GM funding.
First, after identifying key signals and transcriptional regulators of niche cell specification, we revealed
the dynamics of niche formation by live-imaging. This enabled us to suggest mechanisms underlying
niche morphogenesis that are so central to its function. We pursue the underlying mechanisms in this
proposal, capitalizing on our knowledge of cytoskeletal control over cell-cell organization, and in
particular the involvement of actomyosin contractility and RhoA signaling.
Second, we discovered that the niche imposes precise control over fundamental cellular processes
such as abscission and midbody inheritance in order to regulate stem cell dynamics during tissue
homeostasis and upon stresses, such as aging. We found that dysregulations of either of these
fundamental cell biological processes compromises tissue function. Furthermore, the control of
midbody inheritance as detailed in the proposal should have an impact generally on our
understanding of how normal and cancer cells deal with defects in centrosome number.
To address our hyptheses, we combine the powerful genetic and molecalur approaches available in
using Drosohila, with state-of-the-art assays in cellualr mechanics, which include high spatial and
temporal live-imaging, FRAP and laser ablation.
Collectively, our approaches should reveal the undelying mechnics that establish a niche properly,
and reveal important cellular features that allow stem cells to maintain tissues.

Candidate: Kristin Kan, MD MPH MSc is a pediatric physician and clinical investigator focused on designing
and implementing evidence-based, health-system interventions to support children with asthma. Dr. Kan’s
long-term goal is to be an independent physician-investigator and leading expert in implementation science
and health system interventions that improve the outcomes and quality of care for children with asthma.
Research Context: Of the 5.5 million US children with pediatric asthma, over half have uncontrolled
symptoms due in part to poor asthma self-management, leading to high rates of acute unscheduled care and
activity limitations. Supporting guideline-based preventive asthma care, especially adherence to medications,
is a critical step in reducing uncontrolled symptoms among high-risk asthma populations. There is evidence
suggesting that mobile health (mHealth) technologies can be part of an effective intervention to improve
adherence and symptom control. However, data from our previous mHealth asthma trial and other studies
suggest that limitations in mHealth use in real-world health care are partly attributable to the lack of optimizing
health system integration of the mHealth tool and the implementation strategy.
Specific Aims: (1) Optimize a mHealth pediatric asthma intervention and implementation plan with caregivers
and health system stakeholders through user-centered design workshops and interviews. (2) Conduct a
feasibility study of an adaptive, mHealth asthma intervention and multi-stakeholder implementation plan to
improve asthma symptom control and medication adherence.
Research Plan: To accomplish these aims, Dr. Kan will engage caregivers of children with asthma, clinical
staff, and health system administrators to refine the design of an existing mHealth asthma intervention, identify
health care services to integrate the intervention in health care delivery, and design an implementation
strategy. Dr. Kan will then conduct a feasibility trial with caregiver-child dyads, whom will be randomized to an
adaptive mHealth asthma intervention. Findings will help prepare for a future, full-scale hybrid implementation-
effectiveness trial.
Career Development Plan: Dr. Kan’s training goals include: (1) acquire experience in user-centered design
(UCD) methods, (2) develop expertise in clinical trial design & evaluation in health care settings, (3) increase
competencies in implementation science research methods, and (4) learn statistical techniques for analyzing
longitudinal data. Dr. Kan’s career development goals will be well-supported by an interdisciplinary mentorship
team, a planned series of didactic learning, and implementation of her research plan.
Environment: Dr. Kan has a NIH-funded core mentorship and advisory team, who are dedicated to
mentoring her to independence, and is also supported by Northwestern University and Lurie Children’s
Hospital, both with outstanding research infrastructures and commitments to supporting junior investigators."
10808192,"Project Summary/Abstract
There has been rapid escalation in adolescent-onset type 2 diabetes (T2D), particularly in females from
historically disadvantaged racial/ethnic groups. Prevention is critical because adolescent-onset T2D often shows
a more aggressive disease course than adult-onset, and effective treatment options remain elusive. Standard-
of-care for T2D prevention includes exercise training to ameliorate insulin resistance, a key physiological
precursor to T2D. Despite short-term benefits, exercise training shows insufficient effectiveness in adolescents
at-risk for T2D. Depression may be explanatory in a considerable subset of teenagers. Adolescence is notable
for increases in depression and decreases in physical activity, especially in females with obesity. Youths'
depression symptoms contribute to worsening insulin resistance over time, independent of BMI (kg/m2), likely
through stress-mediated pathways such as reduced physical activity and fitness. Also, adolescent depression is
associated with decreased physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness, even after accounting for adiposity,
and depression predicts greater non-adherence to exercise training. The central theme of this proposal is that
an intervention sequence of delivering cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) first, followed by intervening with
exercise training second, will offer a targeted, efficacious strategy for improving insulin resistance and
consequently, lowering T2D risk in adolescent females at-risk for T2D with depression symptoms. In a prior
NIH/NIDDK K99/R00 randomized controlled trial (RCT), we found that 6-week group CBT decreased depression
at 6-week follow-up in adolescent females at-risk for T2D with moderately elevated depression, compared to a
6-week didactic health education control group. Adolescents with elevated depression who were randomized to
CBT had lower fasting and 2-hour insulin at 1-year vs. controls. Our preliminary data suggest that CBT's focus
on enhancing frequency/enjoyment of physical activity to combat depressed mood partially explained why
decreasing depression lowered T2D risk. It is not known if CBT is just as efficacious as standard-of-care exercise
training, or whether CBT followed by exercise training results in a maximally potent alleviation of T2D risk in
adolescent females at-risk for T2D with depression symptoms. To address these gaps and directly build on our
prior work, we propose a four-arm RCT to: (1) Compare the efficacy of four 6-week-->6-week sequences for
improving insulin resistance in N=300 adolescent females at-risk for T2D with elevated depression symptoms:
(i) CBT-->exercise, (ii) exercise-->CBT, (iii) CBT only (CBT-->continue CBT), and (iv) exercise only
(exercise-->continue exercise); (2) Evaluate physical activity/fitness as mediators underlying the depression-
insulin resistance association; and (3) Evaluate underlying mechanisms by which decreasing depression
increases physical activity and improves fitness and insulin resistance using a mixed-methods process
evaluation. Findings will support our long-term goal to identify feasible, cost-effective intervention strategies with
high potential for effective dissemination to adolescents at-risk for T2D with elevated depression symptoms."

Very little is known about the mechanisms of these reactions, the understanding of which will facilitate the
synthesis of new anticancer drugs and antibiotics to which bacteria are not yet resistant. Very few well-
characterized FeIII-O2•– compounds have been reported, and only two include a thiolate in the coordination
sphere. Our group reported the first and only example of an RS-FeIII-O2•– capable of cleaving strong C-H bonds
on par with cysteine β-C-H bond cleaved by IPNS. The goal of the work proposed herein will be to determine
whether ligand constraints can be used to alter the reaction pathway of our RS-FeIII-O2•– from that of IPNS to that
of CDO. We will incorporate β-hydrogens into our aliphatic thiolate ligand and determine whether intramolecular
β C-H bond cleavage occurs, and β-deuteriums to see if that stabilizes the FeIII-O2•–, and if so, determine the
kinetic isotope effect to provide additional support for intramolecular β-C-H bond cleavage. We will determine
whether the trans thiolate influences the potency of our RS-FeIII-O2•– with respect to C-H bond cleavage by
exploring the O2 chemistry of our mixed alkoxide/thiolate-ligated FeII complex. We will use Mossbauer
spectroscopy and spectro-electrochemistry to provide evidence for the involvement of proton coupled electron
transfer in the conversion of our putative high valent O=(R)S-FeIV=O to the corresponding O=(R)S-FeIII-OH and
obtain the FeIIIO–H bond strength from the slope of the Pourbaix (pH vs E1/2) diagram. We will also examine the
effects of redox inactive Lewis acidic cations and protons on the ability of our crystallographically characterized
cis RS-FeIV=O to cleave strong C-H bonds, and determine how the thiolate affects this reactivity by synthesizing
the corresponding cis RO-FeIV=O compound and examining pH-dependent redox potentials using spectro-
electrochemistry and comparing the O–H bond strengths, obtained from the slope of the Pourbaix (pH vs E1/2)
diagram, for cis RO-FeIII-OH versus cis RS-FeIII-OH. We will insert a methylene group into the ligand scaffold of
our crystallographically characterized cis RS-FeIV=O to determine whether ligand constraints prevent
intramolecular oxo atom transfer. Lastly, we will determine whether the synergistic interaction between a 𝛑-
donating thiolate and 𝛑-accepting CO ligands facilitates hydrogenase (H2-ase) promoted H2 production and H2
cleavage."

In the United States, emerging adults (EAs, ages 18-29) consume alcohol at higher rates than
people in any other age group, and the number and rate of alcohol-related deaths increased
approximately 25% during the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic. Black EAs and EAs
who are not graduates of four-year colleges experience greater consequences from alcohol use
and have been identified as an understudied, high-priority group by both NIAAA and the US
Institute of Medicine. Funded by NIAAA, we have followed a diverse community-based cohort of
601 emerging adults since 2017 (mean age at inception = 22.5; 47% White, 42% Black; 35%
without a college degree). Phase one of Project BETA was the first to carefully examine
behavioral economic predictors of alcohol use trajectories in the mid-twenties and has
generated 34 publications and supported 4 funded secondary grants. We recently completed
data collection and have identified subgroups of emerging adults who have (1) reduced their
drinking since becoming involved with the study and report consistent low-risk drinking over the
past year based on the WHO Classification (N = 281) or (2) increased drinking or been relatively
persistent high-risk drinkers throughout the course of study (as defined by the WHO
Classification; N = 174). The proposed R21 will leverage these existing subgroups by having 40
participants from each of these subgroups (50% of participants enrolled will be Black) view a
summary of their individual drinking trajectories throughout their 3.5-year participation in the
parent study to facilitate a discussion of potentially modifiable factors associated with self-
change or persistent risky drinking, including behavioral economic variables and experiences of
discrimination. In addition to gaining an understanding of how participants successfully changed
their drinking, our interviews and qualitative analyses will also gain insights into how to design
and disseminate prevention and intervention programs to reduce alcohol risk for diverse
community-residing emerging adults. We will obtain feedback on preferred intervention content,
modalities, and locations/venues. Our team includes experts in emerging adult alcohol misuse,
addiction and recovery, brief interventions, qualitative methods, and cultural adaptation of
alcohol treatments for Black Americans and is thus ideally suited to successfully complete these
aims and to use the results to develop and refine effective, culturally informed alcohol
prevention approaches with high potential for dissemination in community settings in a
subsequent R01 application."

Developing minimally invasive and low-cost AD and AD-related dementia (ADRD) tests with
high sensitivity and specificity is an urgent and unmet need for early AD diagnosis, differential
diagnosis with other tauopathies, monitoring disease severity, predicting disease courses, and
assessing effectiveness of drug treatment. In this project we will develop phosphorylated tau (p-
tau) new biomarkers for early AD diagnosis and for differentiation of AD from other tauopathies.
Through a systemic site-specific p-tau antibody screening, we have identified several new and
highly selective p-tau AD biomarkers from postmortem brain tissues. They are not only able to
differentiate AD from non-AD tauopathies, but also able to diagnose mild cognitive impairment
(MCI), an early disease stage of AD, from cognitively normal subjects with better diagnostic
performance than those of existing p-tau biomarkers, p-tau181 and p-tau217. We intend to
validate our newly discovered p-tau biomarkers in accessible biofluid plasma and cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) by developing ultrasensitive single molecular array (Simoa) based tests for detection
and quantification. Two Specific Aims will be pursued. In Aim 1, we will develop novel biofluid p-
tau biomarkers for early AD diagnosis. In Aim 2, we will develop new p-tau biomarkers for
differentiating AD from other tauopathies. In both Aims, we will test our new biomarkers with
significant number of subjects, extend to premortem patient plasma and CSF samples, and
develop ultrasensitive Simoa biomarker tests. We anticipated our work has significant clinical
and translational values that may lead to AD and ADRD diagnostic tests with improved
sensitivity and specificity."
10792981,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Arsenic exposure from well water and food is a major public health concern. Early life (e.g., prenatal) exposure
to low level arsenic increases risk of developing psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety in
adulthood. Arsenic is an endocrine disruptor and available evidence suggests that its psychopathological effects
stem from interference with glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling; however, gaps remain in our understanding
of the underlying mechanisms. Krüppel-like factor 9 (Klf9) is a transcription factor important for neurogenesis
and metabolic regulation and is a regulatory hub at the junction of multiple endocrine and cellular stress signaling
pathways. KLF9 has been implicated in stress-induced psychopathology and neurodegeneration. We and others
have shown that Klf9 is a feedforward regulator of GR signaling. We have obtained preliminary data indicating
that the GR-Klf9 gene regulatory pathway is perturbed in zebrafish embryos exposed to low-level arsenic, This
exploratory/developmental research project will use zebrafish as a model system to test the hypothesis that
chronic early life exposure to low levels of arsenic increases risk of depression and/or other psychiatric disorders
by developmentally altering homeostatic setpoints to persistently impede GR- and/or Klf9-dependent stress
responsivity, resulting in long-term loss of plasticity and dysfunction. Zebrafish are an ideal model system for the
proposed studies as they share all the relevant genes and neuroendocrine signaling pathways with humans, and
are social, diurnal animals with complex behaviors that can be measured and related to human psychology and
stress-responsive behavior. Moreover, the larvae provide unsurpassed access for experimental manipulation
and observation, and transgenic reporter lines for monitoring GR and brain activity by fluorescence microscopy.
The proposed research will use those tools, as well as a klf9 and GR-knockout lines that we recently created
using CRISPR, to accomplish two specific aims. The first is to determine if chronic exposure to arsenic results
in long-term glucocorticoid resistance and increased neuroinflammation. To that end we will assess the effects
of chronic arsenic exposure during early development on basal and stress-induced activity of GR target genes
and inflammation markers in larvae and adult brain tissue, as well as on larval and adult cortisol levels. The
second specific aim is to determine if chronic developmental exposure to low level arsenic results in aberrant
brain activity and behaviors. To accomplish this, we will use fluorescence microscopy and automated movement
tracking to ask how chronic developmental exposure to low-level arsenic affect brain development, basal and
stress-responsive neuronal activity in parts of the larval brain that regulate neuroendocrine stress signaling, and
behavior of the exposed larvae across the lifespan. The project will open a new avenue for future research
focused on the mechanisms underlying the the pathophysiological effects of early life arsenic exposure on the
neuroendocrine stress system."

Exercise is a powerful strategy to improve skeletal muscle metabolism that can both prevent and reverse
disease. However, the complex signaling that drives the immediate and long-term changes in muscle metabolism
is incompletely understood. Skeletal muscle is composed of numerous cell types (e.g., myocytes, vascular
endothelial cells, pericytes, immune cells, etc.). In response to exercise stress, these cells ""talk"" to each other to
orchestrate the increased energy production needed by the skeletal muscle. Understanding the signaling initiated
and the pathways activated with cell type clarity will provide the molecular resolution necessary to unravel the
protective effects of exercise. Our long-term goal is to understand intercellular skeletal muscle signaling initiated
in response to exercise, thus informing strategies to promote health and prevent disease.
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are fast-acting, transient molecules recognized for their ability to initiate
signaling cascades. The current proposal builds upon our K01 research, where we have identified a ROSproducer,
NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4), as a critical initiator of skeletal muscle metabolic responses to exercise.
lmportanUy, this enzyme is most highly expressed in the vascular endothelial cells of skeletal muscle. If we
remove this enzyme from only the endothelium, we observe a blunted metabolic response to acute exercise. We
have previously shown that endothelial NOX4 increases expression and activity of endothelial nitric oxide
synthase (eNOS). Based on these observations, the current proposal seeks to understand if eNOS lies
downstream of NOX4 in mediating skeletal muscle responses to exercise. Therefore, we propose to uncover the
role of eNOS in skeletal muscle mitochondrial metabolism and determine whether eNOS and nitric oxide
production activate exercise-induced mitophagy. We will utilize innovative tools to address these questions and
expect this project to reveal novel information regarding exercise-endothelial signaling. These studies will
generate new hypotheses and will advance the Craige Lab research program by uncovering the underlying
pathways influenced by eNOS. Ultimately, we hope these findings will contribute to the development of targeted
exercise interventions and potentially even provide a foundation for treatment strategies based on exercise as
medicine."

Lyme disease is caused by infection with the spirochete Borrelia (Borreliella) burgdorferi. These spirochetes
are themselves infected by the phage ϕBB-1. Phages are viruses that infect bacteria and are the most
ubiquitous biological entities on the planet. ϕBB-1 is a temperate phage, which has two types of replication: the
lytic cycle involves assembly of phage particles followed by release outside of the bacterium and lysogenic
cycle involves incorporation of the phage into the bacterial genome. The ϕBB-1 prophage are the cp32s, a
large group of nearly identical 32-kb circular plasmids universally found in every species of Borrelia. The
central hypothesis of this application is that ϕBB-1 phage drive horizontal gene transfer of antigens between B.
burgdorferi strains and that this process maintains the spirochete in its reservoir host, allowing for reinfection of
individuals. There have been very few studies on the biology of ϕBB-1 and its role in transduction, the
movement of genetic material between individual B. burgdorferi spirochetes by the ϕBB-1 phage. We endeavor
to uncover the mechanism regulating ϕBB-1 replication and the effect of transduction on the ability of B.
burgdorferi to cycle between its tick vector and vertebrate host. The following specific aims are proposed to
accomplish these research goals: 1) Measure horizontal gene transfer between heterologous Bb strains in the
tick vector; 2) Define the role of ϕBB-1 in maintaining spirochete infectivity in previously infected mice; and 3)
dissect the mechanism of the ϕBB-1 lysis/lysogeny decision. Genetic, genomic, biochemical, and
transcriptomic approaches, as well as the tick-mouse model of Lyme disease, will be utilized to experimentally
pursue these aims. In this innovative application, the team of PIs have generated compelling preliminary data
and are in the unique position of having the experience, expertise, and experimental models to enhance the
mechanistic understanding of ϕBB-1 biology, including the regulation of replication decisions and the
consequences of transduction on the ability of B. burgdorferi to infect previously infected hosts. The long-term
objective of this proposal is to understand the role of ϕBB-1 phage on B. burgdorferi microbiology and Lyme
disease pathogenesis, which will lead to improved diagnostic, prevention, and treatment strategies because
genetic diversity is required for the maintenance of B. burgdorferi in its tick-vertebrate cycle as well as for the
reinfection of previous Lyme disease patients; this is relevant to the mission of the agency to “seek
fundamental knowledge” for the sake of alleviating human disease."
10801119,"Mutations in the dysferlin gene (DYSF) cause Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy Type 2B (LGMD 2B) and
Miyoshi Myopathy (MMD1) and affect ~1:100,000 individuals worldwide. Dysferlin is comprised of ferlin and
dysferlin domains flanked by C2 domains and it accumulates in t-tubule membranes (TTs) at triad junctions
(TJs). Our labs have been collaborating to learn how DYSF fulfills its two best understood functions in muscle,
repair of the sarcolemmal membrane and stabilization of the Ca2+ transient. We recently showed that DYSF’s
most N-terminal C2 domain, C2A, plays unique roles in both (Muriel et al., J Physiol. 2022): like WT DYSF,
DYSF missing the C2A domain accumulates in TTs at TJs but it fails to support DYSF’s repair or Ca2+ signaling
activities. In isolation, C2A has novel activities, including binding of phospholipids, Ca2+ and other proteins.
Here we show that, expressed alone as a soluble protein, the DYSF-C2A domain can support both membrane
repair and normal Ca2+ signaling, although unlike full length DYSF it does not concentrate at TJs. This effect is
specific, as other DYSF C2 domains and pathogenic mutants in C2A are inactive. Surprisingly, the C2 domain
of PKCα (C2-PKCα), which shares 58% homology with C2A, concentrates at TJs very efficiently but has no
repair or Ca2+ signaling activity. We adapted this TJ-targeting activity of C2-PKCα in a chimeric construct with
C2-PKCα to restore the localization of the DYSF-C2A domain localization to TJs. The chimera increases the
activity of C2A, especially at low expression levels. These and other data suggest: (i) C2-PKCα interacts with
proteins at TJs to promote its accumulation there; (ii) targeting C2-PKCα-DYSF-C2A to TJs, where it can bind
Ca2+ that leaks into the junctional cleft, may be sufficient to support Ca2+ signaling and membrane repair; and
(iii) AAV encoding an optimized chimeric construct of PKCα-C2 and DYSF-C2A may offer a therapy for
dysferlinopathies. We will test these ideas in 4 specific aims: (1) optimize the efficacy and specificity of
engineered constructs of Dysf-C2A to rescue the deficits in Ca2+ signaling and membrane repair in DYSF-null
muscle in vitro; (2) identify the mechanism of targeting of the effective chimeric constructs to TJs; (3) test if
Ca2+ binding at TJs is sufficient to account for the activities of these constructs, and to use other chimeric
constructs to measure the [Ca2+] in the TJ cleft under a range of conditions; and (4) determine if AAV encoding
the most potent of our constructs can rescue the phenotypes of dysferlinopathic mice in vitro and in vivo. Our
hypothesis is that the C2A domain of DYSF, targeted to TJs, is a potent, efficient and stable replacement
for WT DYSF in dysferlinopathic muscle. The goal of this multi-PI application is to critically test this
hypothesis and each of the concepts on which it is based. If we are successful, our approach will facilitate
AAV-mediated gene therapy by allowing effective packaging (our ORFs are all <1.8 kb) and thus improving
transduction efficiency. As dysregulation of Ca2+ and faulty membrane repair can underlie other diseases of
striated muscle, our approach may ultimately prove applicable to other muscular dystrophies as well."

In the course of developing cytomegalovirus (CMV) as a new vaccine platform for eliciting effector differentiated
T cell immunity, we observed that rhesus CMV (RhCMV) expressing simian immunodeficiency (SIV) antigens
elicit immune responses that control and ultimately clear highly pathogenic SIV. Surprisingly however, protection
was only observed with genetically modified vectors eliciting CD8+ T cells restricted by non-polymorphic, highly
conserved MHC-E instead of classical MHC-I. Targeting HIV peptides presented by HLA-E thus represents a
novel, unexpected and unconventional approach to AIDS vaccine development that has recently entered the
clinical phase. However, we have only a very limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms that render
CMV the only vaccine vector capable of eliciting these unconventional responses to any antigen and that render
lentivirus-infected cells vulnerable to T cell control. Our findings that MHC-E presents a wide variety of antigens
is unexpected because MHC-E predominantly binds the nonameric VMAPRTL(L,I,V,F)L (VL9) self-peptide
contained in the cleavable leader sequence of MHC-I. Here, our goal is to elucidate how MHC-E is loaded with
diverse non-canonical peptides in uninfected cells or in cells infected with HIV or CMV in vitro and to identify the
RhCMV-infected cells and molecular mechanisms required for the priming of MHC-E restricted CD8+ T cells in
vivo. These objectives will be accomplished by an international team of investigators with relevant experience.
Aim 1 is to use a unique set of MHC-E/peptide specific reagents to monitor MHC-E peptide loading and
presentation by myeloid and HIV-infected cells upon inhibiting specific cellular proteins and pathways. Cellular
targets will be selected from hits of preliminary CRISPR/cas9 screens or based on their known function in
vesicular traffic or peptide loading of classical MHC molecules. In aim 2, we will investigate how the extensive
reorganization of intracellular vesicular structures observed in CMV-infected cells contributes to the loading of
MHC-E with non-canonical peptides. A particular emphasis will be on the role of viral microRNAs which redirect
vesicular traffic by targeting vesicular sorting proteins and which seem to be required for MHC-E restricted T cell
stimulation by CMV-infected cells. The role of viral microRNAs as well as selected host pathways for the induction
of these T cells in vivo will be examined in aim 3. This will be accomplished by generating recombinant RhCMV
lacking microRNAs or expressing host gene-targeting small hairpin RNAs. Since recent results suggest that
priming of MHC-E restricted T cells requires infection of myeloid cells expressing micro-RNA142, we will identify
the infected cell type and characterize neighboring T cells by combining sophisticated imaging and spatial
transcriptomic techniques. We expect that the results of this research will impact basic and translational
immunology including the design of novel vaccines and immunotherapeutics."
10801510,"Pregnancy induced deacetylation of sialylated glycoproteins
Abstract. Pregnancy confers susceptibility to severe infection caused by intracellular pathogens, including the
prototypical perinatal bacterial pathogen, Listeria monocytogenes (Lm). Residence inside cells has traditionally
been thought to be exploited by microbes to evade antibody-mediated immunity since IgG cannot cross the
plasma membrane and directly enter cells. Our ongoing studies challenge this paradigm by showing vertically
transferred maternal IgG antibodies efficiently protect neonates against Lm infection. The key molecular
change enabling protection is deacetylation of terminal sialic acid residues in glycosylated anti-Lm IgG.
Expression of the deacetylating enzyme sialic acid acetyl esterase (SIAE) increases during pregnancy. This
enzyme is essential since anti-Lm antibodies in SIAE-deficient pregnant mice remain acetylated, and non-
protective upon vertical transfer into neonates. Sialylated glycoproteins normally stimulate host cells by binding
CD22, an inhibitory Siglec expressed by B cells. However, acetylation blocks CD22 binding, establishing the
framework whereby differential acetylation versus deacetylation of sialylated IgG and other glycoproteins can
profoundly impact immunity through CD22 binding, which in turn, controls activation and immune-modulatory
function of B cells and other cell types with regulatory potential. Although these results significantly broaden
the scope for how antibodies work, they also unveil important new knowledge gaps on whether deacetylated
IgG similarly protects against infection outside the neonatal window, including during pregnancy with similarly
increased susceptibility to Lm systemic infection, and after parturition when deacylated antibodies are still
present at high levels. Other questions include the maternal cell types expressing SIAE responsible for
antibody protective conversion, and the larger impacts on fetal tolerance and pregnancy outcomes controlled
by deacetylation considering many fetal alloantigenic glycoproteins also contain sialylated N-linked glycans.
Our overall hypothesis is that SIAE deacetylation unmasks a variety of sialylated glycoproteins as new CD22
ligands, which differentially modulate the suppressive properties of maternal immune cells, with context-
dependent impacts on infection susceptibility and pregnancy outcomes. Shared susceptibility to Lm infection
during pregnancy in humans and rodents will be exploited to further investigate how deacetylated antibodies
work, in concert with fetal alloantigenic glycoproteins, through the following specific aims: Aim 1, determine
whether deacetylated IgG protects against Lm systemic infection during pregnancy and after parturition; Aim 2,
establish the SIAE-expressing maternal cell subset(s) responsible for IgG protective conversion; Aim 3,
investigate how SIAE exposed CD22 ligands control fetal tolerance and pregnancy outcomes. Completion of
these aims will not only unveil important insights as to how antibodies protect against intracellular infection, but
also new information on the immune-pathogenesis of fetal wastage that occurs with Lm prenatal infection and
exciting ways for boosting antimicrobial immunity in this vulnerable physiological window."
10801511,"Mental health disorders are very common. Last year, 120 million Americans were treated with a psychoactive
prescription drug. The use of psychoactive prescription drugs is increasing despite their untoward side effects,
some of which are very serious and can result in hospitalization and death. These side effects may be substan-
tially amplified by concomitantly used medications, i.e., a harmful drug interaction (DI). This is concerning since
the use of multiple drugs is common and increasing among persons with mental health disorders, including in
older adults with multiple chronic conditions. In fact, harmful DIs are projected to result in nearly 5 million
hospitalizations and 150,000 premature deaths of older adults in the next decade. Unfortunately, nearly all
existing evidence on DIs with psychoactive prescription drugs comes from case reports or pharmacokinetic
studies examining drug concentration changes rather than clinical endpoints. Thus, DI compendia and clinical
decision support software surely fail to warn against unrecognized harmful psychoactive DIs, and falsely warn
against safe combinations that prevent appropriate use and contribute to alert fatigue.
 Of the very few studies of effects of psychoactive DIs on clinical endpoints, most examined injurious falls.
None have systematically examined venous thromboembolism (VTE) or serious bleeding, despite well
documented associations between VTE and antipsychotics and benzodiazepines, and between serious bleeding
and antidepressants. Biologically plausible mechanisms support both VTE and bleeding risks, including
antipsychotics’ dopamine antagonism increasing platelet aggregation and antidepressants’ serotonin reuptake
inhibition increasing gastric acid secretion, inhibiting platelet activity, and increasing bleeding time. Effects of
psychoactive DIs on VTE and bleeding have been hypothesized by many, but remain unstudied. Given high
rates of VTE and serious bleeding in older adults, it is imperative to identify drugs that increase patients’ risks of
these serious clinical endpoints when co-administered with commonly used psychoactive prescription drugs.
 We propose a triphasic strategy to: a) generate signals of psychoactive DIs resulting in VTE and/or
serious bleeding, via screening of longitudinal healthcare data; b) prioritize signals via multidisciplinary expert
panel focus groups; and then c) test, in an independent population, these prioritized signals in a series of rigorous
cohort studies built on a causal inference framework designed to emulate target trials. These complementary
phases ensure achievement of our broad objective to generate clinically-actionable psychoactive DI evidence to
prevent iatrogenic harm in patients. We will apply each of the three phases to each of the following specific aims:
1) generate signals for antipsychotics (by class and for individual agents) resulting in emergency department
treatment ± hospitalization for acute VTE (phase a), prioritize DI signals (phase b), then test their associations
via emulated target trials in independent data (phase c); 2) perform these steps for benzodiazepines and related
drugs and acute VTE; and 3) perform these steps for antidepressants and serious bleeding."
10801585,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Cisplatin is frequently used to treat squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), frequently in combination with other drugs
or ionizing radiation (IR). Tumor recurrence due to therapeutic failure occurs in approximately 8% of patients
within 5 years of treatment, and the 5-year survival for individuals with recurrent disease remains around 55%
despite the recent introduction of targeted immunotherapies. The mechanisms regulating cisplatin resistance
remain poorly understood, representing a significant gap in knowledge with high clinical relevance. This proposal
will elucidate novel mechanisms of cisplatin resistance in SCC, thus opening new avenues for much needed
treatment strategies for chemoresistant HNSCC and enabling rapid advancements in the field.
∆Np63α is a proto-oncogene implicated in cisplatin resistance and overexpressed in SCC of the skin, head and
neck, cervix, and lung. We previously published that the TIP60 acetyltransferase directly acetylates and
stabilizes ∆Np63α to promote SCC cell proliferation. Our preliminary data indicate that (a) chemoresistance to
cisplatin correlates with high ∆Np63α and TIP60 levels in HNSCC tumors and skin SCC cell lines, (b) TIP60
inhibits the ubiquitination and degradation of ∆Np63α while increasing its acetylation, (c) silencing TIP60 or
inhibiting its HAT activity using TH1834 downregulates ∆Np63α, reduces its acetylation, increases cell apoptosis,
and sensitizes cells to cisplatin, and (d) we demonstrated an increased efficacy of cisplatin-IR treatment and the
IR-TH1834 combination demonstrating that TIP60 inhibition increases sensitivity to IR. We hypothesize that
TIP60 promotes cSCC and HNSCC proliferation and cisplatin resistance via enhanced stability of ∆Np63α and
function. To test this hypothesis, we will (Aim 1) determine how acetylation of ΔNp63α by TIP60 impacts the
ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of ΔNp63α, (Aim 2) investigate how TIP60 mediated acetylation of
ΔNp63α alters transcriptional activity to impact apoptosis, the DDR and ultimately cisplatin resistance, and (Aim
3) elucidate the role of the TIP60/ΔNp63α axis in SCC progression and therapeutic response utilizing cell derived
xenograft models and efficacy studies in HNSCC PDX models to determine the effectiveness of a TIP60 inhibitor
as a potential therapeutic adjunct to standard of care chemoradiation (cisplatin and IR) treatment.
Together, the combined use of gain- and loss-of-function in vitro analyses, in vivo xenograft and PDX models of
cisplatin-resistant SCC will provide a statistically rigorous characterization of TIP60/∆Np63α signaling in cisplatin
resistance, apoptosis, and the DNA damage response in SCC; and will assess a potential novel therapy. This
will aid in the identification of additional potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of SCC and other epithelial
cancers, including nasopharyngeal and lung carcinomas and provide critical insights into the therapeutic
potential of acetyltransferase inhibitors."
10930139,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathophysiology seldom occurs in isolation, and it is widely established from the
neuropathology literature that the majority of individuals with dementia have multiple etiology dementia (MED).
MED is common but undetected in extant major cohort studies and treatment trials for AD; many studies
intentionally restrict clinical heterogeneity to an assumed single etiology by using narrowly defined clinical
enrollment criteria. A major gap in our field is the lack of validated tools to detect MED in-vivo. The next era of
large-scale imaging biomarker studies for AD and related disorders (ADRD) will require strategies commensurate
with the known but largely unaddressed problem of etiologic heterogeneity. The Alzheimer’s Disease Research
Centers (ADRCs) are uniquely positioned to meet this need. Collectively the 37 ADRCs follow ~14,000 active
enrollees with high brain donor and autopsy rates (>60%). The ADRCs recruit across the clinical severity
continuum and amply represent the several diseases comprising ADRD. Now, as a consortium, the centers will
conduct a uniform imaging protocol capable of elucidating individualized etiological profiles including
foundational PET imaging for AD proteinopathy (Amyloid and Tau), vascular burden with MRI and additional
structural MRI and FDG PET for assessing the several patterns of morphologic and metabolic
Neurodegeneration signatures of both AD and non-AD proteinopathies on deeply phenotyped patients. Design:
This is a longitudinal imaging study at 2-year intervals that is superimposed on and fully integrated with the
ongoing uniform cognitive and clinical data collection the 37 ADRCs already do. We will study 2,000
ethnoculturally diverse ADRC participants that are either clinically unimpaired (CU; N=800) or impaired
(N=1,200) where AD is a considered, though need not be the primary suspected etiology. Aim 1 creates the ATN
cohort through prospective imaging and plasma collection and establishes the foundational shared resource in
conjunction with the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC) with linkage to the vast clinical, cognitive,
and genetic datasets on these same participants. In Aim 2 we examine the temporal progression of the two most
common etiologies—AD and vascular disease. We examine onset ages and duration of each and their joint
effect on cognitive decline. Aim 3 focuses on other common proteinopathies. Classification and joint modelling
methods will be applied to estimate etiologic composition and the effect of multi-proteinopathy on clinical and
cognitive change. ATN imaging–a critical foundation for characterizing likely dementia etiologies—is needed on
this expertly-diagnosed, uniformly evaluated MED ADRD cohort where neuropathology can inform
clinicopathologic correlation, mechanistic underpinnings, and strategic diagnostic and therapeutic development.
The consortium of ADRCs have the expertise and capacity to conduct this study and will work together to ensure
its success and its impact on the field."
10932981,"Project Summary
 In this project we will study two important homeostasis/stress responses we have discovered in C.
elegans. Each of these responses is mediated by the conserved transcription factor SKN-1A, the ortholog of
human Nrf1 (NF-E2-related factor 1). SKN-1A/Nrf1 resides in the ER and canonically maintains proteasome
levels. However, in a pathway we term the SKN-1A/Nrf1 lipid homeostasis response, SKN-1A is activated
independently of proteasome activity by the monounsaturated fatty acid oleic acid (OA), through effects on ER
membrane and metabolic mechanisms. In turn, SKN-1A reduces fat levels, enhances proteostasis, and extends
lifespan. In the second response, SKN-1A is activated by ribosomal assembly stress which, unexpectedly,
induces a metabolic crisis in which lipids and specific amino acids (AAs) are depleted. SKN-1A counteracts this
stress by increasing AA levels, improving proteostasis, and supporting translation. Ribosomal stress can also
be ameliorated by AA feeding, which partially reverses these metabolic deficits. Our findings add a new
dimension to our understanding of protein synthesis homeostasis. They are also likely relevant to human
ribosomopathies such as Diamond Blackfan Anemia (DBA), a genetic disease resulting from ribosomal subunit
mutations, and suggest potential metabolic treatment strategies for such diseases. Each of these SKN-1A
functions provides a window into mechanisms that are fundamentally important for metabolism and aging.
 In Aim 1 we will focus on the SKN-1A/Nrf1 lipid homeostasis response. We will investigate how SKN-1A
acts through specific mechanisms and in certain tissues to promote health and lifespan in response to OA, and
perform cell culture experiments to test our model that key features of this response are conserved in humans.
 In Aims 2 and 3 we will further develop our models for how ribosomal stress affects the organism and is
counteracted by SKN-1A, and examine conservation of these mechanisms. In Aim 2 we will test our hypothesis
that the metabolic demands of impaired ribosomal assembly induce the metabolic crisis we have observed. We
will elucidate the cause(s) of these metabolic demands through collaborative stable isotope tracing metabolomic
pathway analyses, and lipidomics. Our metabolomics will be guided in part by identification of specific AA
combinations that can rescue effects of ribosomal stress and the lack of SKN-1A. We will also determine whether
the translation deficits that result from ribosomal stress and lack of SKN-1A are mediated in part through
decreased AA levels affecting mTORC1 signaling and/or ribosome stalling. In Aim 3 we will investigate the
importance of SKN-1A and AA availability for lifespan extensions induced by ribosomal perturbation. We will
also determine whether the SKN-1A/Nrf1 response to ribosomal stress is conserved in human cells, including
investigating collaboratively whether human Nrf1 and AA supplementation are beneficial in an in vitro human
erythroid DBA model."

Disorders of the nervous system are becoming more prevalent in our society, especially
considering the growing elderly population who are more vulnerable to neurodysregulation. To
meet the challenge of developing new and effective therapies to treat these disorders, we need
to consistently inspire intelligent and talented undergraduate students to enter careers in
neuroscience research. This need is particularly acute among populations of students who are
currently underrepresented in the field of neuroscience research. Published analyses have
made it clear that making students aware of research fields early in their college careers,
especially by involving them directly in the research process, is an extremely effective way of
developing a student’s interest in research as a future profession. For over 30 years, the
University of Minnesota has recognized and met this challenge by offering summer residential
research programs in biomedical sciences. This proposal is to fund a neuroscience component
of these summer programs in which we will train 8 undergraduate students who have completed
their freshman or sophomore years in college. We will recruit students nationally, focusing on
students from groups that are underrepresented within the neuroscience research profession,
including economically disadvantaged and disabled students. We will provide them with a 10-
week intensive residential research experience that will include professional mentoring
(academic survival skills and preparation for graduate school) as well as workshops on research
ethics. Our goals are to inspire a new generation of neuroscience researchers as well as to
create a national mentoring pool who will accept that responsibility for future generations of
students. In turn, we expect these individuals to become part of the research infrastructure
dedicated to solving medical problems of nervous system dysfunction."

Three-dimensional shape lies at the core of understanding the physical objects that surround us. The Shape
AnaLysis Toolbox (SALT) was created to be a dissemination vehicle for advanced shape modeling and
analysis methodology as an open-source, comprehensive and freely distributed software. Over the past four
years, we have been successful in increasing the ease of use and effectiveness of state-of-the-art shape
analysis methodology for biomedical researchers in need of such techniques.
We now propose necessary and novel enhancements to our methods and our dissemination model in order to
continue maximizing the success of SALT. We will also modify the architecture of SALT to better integrate
biomedical imaging research workflows by improving the efficiency and scripting capabilities so SlicerSALT
can be deployed in batch mode for large-scale sequential computations. We will also shift our focus from
shape modeling into state-of-the-art statistical shape analysis methodologies, necessary to serve clinical
applications and to increase the interpretability of shape biomarkers. We will continue to disseminate novel
example applications that best demonstrate how to use our tools to perform impactful research and will provide
fully digital documentation for user support.
The ultimate goal of SlicerSALT is to maximize the potential benefits of the geometric information contained in
medical data and to expand its use beyond simple visualization to support clinical research."

Cannabis (CB) use is prevalent amongst people with HIV (PWH) but its impact on HIV infection and the latent
viral reservoir has not been fully examined. In particular, the impact of CB on the HIV reservoir in solid tissues
such as the brain is completely unknown. As such, animal models in which dosing can be carefully controlled
and tissue samples can be analyzed will be important to fully understand how CB impacts HIV reservoir
characteristics in tissues. Our central hypothesis is that CB induces an immunosuppressive cellular state that
impacts viral transcription and maintenance of the HIV reservoir in tissues. The overall goal of this proposal is
to develop a humanized mouse model of CB exposure during HIV infection and to use this model to learn how
CB use affects characteristics of the tissue resident HIV reservoir. In the R61 phase, HIV infected humanized
mice expressing hIL-34 to promote microglial CNS reconstitution will be exposed to a range of THC doses
during infection, both before and after viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy (ART). The impact of THC
exposure on viremia, viral suppression, immune markers and cytokines in peripheral blood will be examined.
In the R33 phase, we will use this model to address three major questions. First, viral DNA (vDNA) and viral
RNA (vRNA) levels in the brains and spleens of infected mice that have been dosed with THC will be
quantified to determine the impact of THC on the size and transcriptional activity of the viral reservoir in these
tissues. Second, we will examine whether THC exposure affects HIV latency reversal in vivo. We hypothesize
that cross-talk between inflammatory signaling pathways activated by potent latency reversing agents (LRAs)
such as the non-canonical NF-kB agonist AZD5582 and anti-inflammatory pathways activated by CB use could
significantly alter the outcome of LRA dosing in vivo. To test this hypothesis, THC or control exposed HIV
infected mice will be dosed with AZD5582, and the impact of THC on viremia and viral reactivation in tissues
will be examined. Finally, we will use this model to perform a deep single cell characterization of infected cells
in the brains and spleens of ART-suppressed humanized mice in the presence and absence of THC exposure.
Spleen and brain tissues will be profiled using a combined single cell ATACseq/RNAseq method to identify and
characterize HIV vDNA+ or vRNA+ cells and to compare the abundance and phenotype of these cells between
CB dosed mice and controls. If successful, this proposal will reveal new insights into how CB affects HIV
infection and the characteristics of the tissue-resident HIV reservoir. This in turn will guide novel HIV cure
strategies that are optimized for CB-using PWH."
10814840,"With the majority of US states having adopted legislation to medically and/or recreationally legalize cannabis,
public perception of the drug is now overwhelmingly favorable. Increased access and prevalence of use are
accompanied by perceptions of low health risk and/or of therapeutic benefits associated with cannabis use.
Aside from evidence for symptom relief in certain medical conditions, evidence regarding therapeutic effects of
cannabis for many conditions remains elusive, leaving the decision regarding when and how to use cannabis
to the user. Both therapeutic and recreational reasons (motives) for CU are largely shaped through exposure to
messages about the effects of cannabis, yet little is known about the source of messaging, how it is transmitted
to users, how it shapes their thinking, and ultimately its association with CU patterns. The proposed study will
gather critical information about message sources, cannabis-promoting content, and risk warnings being
disseminated to cannabis users as well as the messages being received, their effects on CU motives, and
subsequent CU. The mixed-methods design will include two phases. Phase 1 involves semi-structured
interviews conducted with 1) cannabis users, as well as with message sources, including 2) cannabis
dispensary and retail outlet staff (budtenders), 3) growers, and 4) health care providers who discuss cannabis
with patients. Additionally, extraction and coding of messaging content will be conducted across internet and
social media messaging platforms. Observational coding of recreational/medical cannabis outlets will be
conducted using validated surveillance tools. Together, these data permit characterization of cannabis
messaging content across various types of sources and platforms (Aim 1) that will in turn inform Phase 2
methods. Phase 2 consists of a three-burst 4-week ecological momentary assessment (EMA) study with a
sample (N=300) of weekly 18-74 year-old cannabis users. Participants will complete brief smartphone-based
measures of exposure to messaging (source and content), cannabis motives, and use patterns in the natural
environment. With these quantitative data, this will be the first study to examine prospective associations
between a user’s exposure to cannabis messaging and motives and other cognitions (Aim 2). Further, we will
test whether cannabis motives are a mechanism underlying the association between cannabis messaging and
CU at both the between-person and within-person levels (Aim 3). Finally, we will explore user characteristics
and message source characteristics as potential moderators of the effects of cannabis messaging and CU
(Aim 4). This combination of complementary and highly rigorous data collection approaches will provide the
most nuanced understanding of the messages being disseminated about the effects of cannabis to the
cannabis user. Findings will arm policy makers and cannabis regulatory science with evidence-based
information about the impact of cannabis messaging that can ultimately reduce potential harms from misuse."

 ABSTRACT/PROJECT SUMMARY
The overarching goal of the Systems, Pathways & Targets (SPT) Program is to discover new critical mechanisms
of cancer proliferation, survival and drug resistance that can be exploited for the development of novel treatments
and diagnostics. SPT members include cell biologists, immunologists, geneticists, systems biologists,
computational scientists, and clinicians who leverage diverse perspectives to build collaborative teams that
tackle long-standing problems in cancer using bold and innovative approaches. SPT members work at different
scales, from molecules and cells to tissues and organs, to study the fundamental biology of individual cancer
cells and the interactions among cells in the tumor environment and metastatic sites. Several SPT members are
physician-scientists with independent research programs and are well-positioned to translate discoveries from
bench to bedside. Moreover, SPT leadership actively connects basic scientists with clinicians through Disease-
Oriented Teams (DOTs) and the annual CFCCC Scientific Retreat. These interactions lead to new clinical trials
and facilitate access to patient samples for research projects. A unique aspect of SPT is the integration of
systems biology approaches to the study of cancer. This emerging emphasis has resulted in productive intra-
and inter-programmatic collaborations and extramural funding including a NCI-U54 grant to support a Center in
Cancer Systems Biology. SPT maximizes progress toward the identification of targets for cancer therapeutics
and diagnostics by devoting resources to recruiting new faculty members, nurturing development of early career
faculty, and supporting mid-career faculty members with cutting-edge research programs focused on cancer cell
biology and therapeutic targeting. To promote collaboration, SPT supports working groups with shared
interests and sponsors conferences and workshops. The Specific Aims of SPT are: to identify key targets in
signaling networks, developmental pathways, and metabolic programs that are relevant to cancer initiation,
progression, and therapeutic resistance; to support multidisciplinary teams that study how heterogeneity at the
single cell level and cell-cell interactions can influence cancer progression and therapeutic resistance; and to
enable clinical-basic science multidisciplinary research via DOTs to accelerate the translation of preclinical
research. These efforts to discover critical pathways and survival mechanisms will reveal novel therapeutic
targets for testing and validation in preclinical models, and eventually in clinical trials.

10816417,"DEVELOPMENTAL FUNDS
PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center (CFCCC) utilizes Developmental Funds to support critical
priorities, aligned with strategic planning, in order to grow and enhance key scientific areas. Prior funds provided
support for staff investigators, faculty recruitment and pilot project funding. In the future funding period,
investments will continue to be focused in these three areas:
Faculty Recruitment: CFCCC has been extensively focused on the recruitment of cancer-focused faculty
recruitments during the current funding period and this remains a priority as outlined in the 2020-2025 CFCCC
Strategic Plan. CFCCC requests Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG) funds for partial support of strategic
faculty recruitments.
Pilot Project Funding: The investment in research proposals to pursue innovative ideas and stimulate high
priority research areas (e.g., population science, translational research, research on underrepresented
populations, and early phase clinical trials) are critical to ensure a high likelihood of future extramural grant
awards. CCSG Developmental Funds will supplement additional funds provided through the Anti-Cancer
Challenge (a peer-to-peer fundraising initiative established by Center Director Richard Van Etten, MD, PhD),
philanthropic, and other institutional funds.
Research Staff Investigators: CFCCC staff investigators are supported through CCSG Developmental Funds
to foster the advancement of key strategic objectives of the Center. Staff Investigators enable the advancement
of priority strategic objectives of the CFCCC. The funded researchers are CFCCC members who are important
contributors to the scientific, translational, and clinical research activities of the Center and who serve in a
significant role in helping the Center achieve scientific objectives above and beyond their own research. During
the future funding period, support will be provided for Farshid Dayyani, MD, PhD and Edward Uchio, MD who
are disease leaders of and significant contributors to clinical research activity, enrolling a large number of patients
in trials and developing and writing investigator-initiated trials with specific regard to CFCCC's Catchment Area."
10816480,"Co-use of tobacco and cannabis has been increasing, especially among young adults in the US, with more than
20% of young adults aged 18-24 reporting use of both substances in the past month. There is growing evidence
that co-use of these substances increases the health consequences and problematic psychosocial outcomes of
either alone, and that use of one product increases the probability of use and failure to stop the other. Co-use is
a broad term and may encompass using both substances within a given time frame (e.g., past month), within a
given episode (concurrent use), in sequence (chasing), or mixed together in the same delivery device (co-
administration). Until recently, co-use was also generally limited to combustible methods, either smoking each
product separately or combining them (e.g., in blunts or spliffs). With the increase in electronic nicotine delivery
systems (ENDS) as well as the increase in states legalizing recreational cannabis, there are new options for co-
use, and ENDS devices that vape e-liquids containing nicotine are becoming more popular methods to consume
cannabis. Although research on co-use is growing, there have been numerous methodological limitations of
prior work, including a lack of detailed data about differences in specific patterns of co-use and modes of delivery,
especially given the rising popularity of alternative tobacco products, as well as a reliance on survey data. Less
is known about the factors that may contribute to the different patterns of co-use in young adults, that may
maintain co-use, and that may be associated with different outcomes. The overall goal of this study is to examine
the situational, momentary factors associated with the different patterns of tobacco and cannabis co-use, how
they may vary by delivery mode, and how they are associated with changes in behavioral outcomes (e.g.,
dependence, changes in rates of use, problem behaviors). This project will use ecological momentary
assessment (EMA) to gather in-depth, real-time naturalistic reports of 425 young adult (aged 18-25) tobacco and
cannabis co-users’ daily experiences and product use behaviors. Across two waves of EMA, we will capture
episodes in which young adults use each product alone as well as when they use them concurrently (during the
same episode), either in a common delivery device (e.g., blunt or vaporizer) or in succession. We will examine
how the proximal context in which the combination of product use occurs and the individual's subjective, affective,
and neurocognitive reactions to those use experiences vary by delivery mode (combustible or vaporized) and
individual characteristics, and how these factors influence future tobacco and cannabis use patterns. Knowledge
gained will provide needed evidence about the behavioral and neurocognitive consequences of co-use use that
will help better inform prevention, intervention, and policy approaches to reducing harms of both products. This
project is also timely in that its data collection occurs in a state (Illinois) that will have just legalized recreational
cannabis use (effective January, 2020)."
10820554,"Kidney transplantation is a life-saving procedure for patients with end-stage kidney
disease. Although the short-term organ survival post-transplantation has improved dramatically
over the past decades, the long-term outcomes remain unsatisfied with the survival half-lives for
transplanted renal grafts still about 10 years. In addition, organ shortage is a global crisis which
has stimulated new approaches on expansion of the donor pool by using marginal organs.
However, the employment of marginal organs has a significantly higher incidence of delayed graft
function and lower graft survival rate compared with standard criteria donors. Therefore, there is
an urgent need for new strategies to improve the long-term graft outcomes.
 In this proposal, a novel hypothesis that rescue macula densa NOS1 expression by
renal alkalization with bicarbonate improves transplanted graft outcomes will be tested.
 The findings of the present proposal will provide a novel strategy with potential
translational significance that could be applied to either donors or recipients during kidney
transplantation. Additionally, the underlying mechanisms and potential targets will be examined.
Renal alkalization to enhance the expression of macula densa NOS1 expression in donors or
recipients is anticipated to be a simple and effective method that is used in the expansion of the
donor pool and improvement of long-term graft survival."
10818058,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Current cell expansion procedures for antigen-specific CAR T cells and CAR NK cells result in cells with
a broad repertoire of chemokine receptors. Upon infusion, they migrate to off-tumor healthy tissues and
exert toxicities by targeting antigens expressed at basal levels. The ability to produce therapeutic cells
with affinity to migrate into the tumor microenvironment (TME) is a critical unmet need. The investigating
team’s mission is to harness the immune system to treat solid tumors. In line with this mission, the
objectives of this R61 are to 1) develop a prototype of the bioreactor to selectively culture chemotactically
competent cell-based therapies (CAR T, CAR NK-92), and 2) demonstrate use of this subset for
migrating through a tissue-mimicking barrier and kill epithelial ovarian cancer cells in an antigen-specific
manner. The rationale for this effort is that it will disrupt the status quo of current cell manufacturing
technology, which generates therapeutic cells that traffic not only to tumors but also to healthy tissue.
The team will conduct the R61 project under two milestone-driven aims: 1) Develop bioreactor for
generating chemotactically competent CAR NK-92 cells; 2) Demonstrate utility of the bioreactor for
generating chemotactically competent CAR T cells. In a follow-on R33, the team will use the bioreactor to
scale up the production of these chemotactically competent cell therapies for preclinical mouse studies.
The impact of bioreactor will be in making treatments safer (by mitigating off-tumor migration of
therapeutic cells) and affordable (by reducing manual intervention in the closed-system bioreactor).
Mitigating off-tumor migration will reduce the burden of manufacturing because most of the therapeutic
cells will reach the target TME site. The significance of this project is also supported by its applicability to
other immune cells (CAR NK cells, CAR macrophages) that are currently in development for targeting
solid tumors."
10820440,"Abstract
 The overall goal of this multi-principal investigator proposal is to facilitate the transition from implication
of genetic variants identified in extensive genome wide association studies (GWAS) of Atrial Fibrillation (AF) to
the molecular mechanisms underlying AF risk. We hypothesize that a novel genomic and analytic pipeline
interrogating regulatory function of genetic variation will identify candidate causative variants and their target
genes, enabling the transition from simple associations to causative mechanisms for the arrhythmia. In
preliminary studies, we have applied novel single cell approaches to generate cell-type-resolved high-resolution
chromosome accessibility maps and taken advantage of coordinated genomic signals to link AF risk variants to
candidate causative AF genes. The results describe a highly interconnected gene regulatory network for cardiac
atrial gene expression. In our first aim we propose to generate multi-modal single-cell genomics data to provide
higher-resolution annotation of variant effects. We will improve our computational procedure to better leverage
these datasets for AF variant and gene discovery. In our second aim, we will interrogate the interconnected
gene regulatory network in molecular enhancer assays and genomic chromatin conformation capture
experiments, to directly examine the impact of nominated genetic variants and their physical association with
candidate target genes. In our third aim, we will examine the functionality of high confidence variant SNPs in
depth, including their impact on gene regulation in cis, their impact on human cardiomyocyte electrophysiology,
and their impact on cardiomyocyte gene expression and chromatin status in trans. We have established a
tractable strategy that will help enable the transition from AF risk variants to molecular mechanisms. We
anticipate that our approach will help translate the promise of AF genetics into meaningful biological insights for
AF and establish a paradigm for the molecular understanding of genetic association studies in any system."

The candidate's long-term objective is to enable optimal and customized intervention to improve mobility. Mo-
bility is an essential physical activity for maintaining an active lifestyle and functional independence and is a
common issue for older adults, where musculoskeletal diseases are the leading cause of mobility limitations.
While robotic orthoses, or exoskeletons, promise to improve mobility, the progress in research is slow as eval-
uation on the outcome of gait assistance currently requires extensive experiments with human subjects. In this
project, the candidate proposes to develop a computer simulation framework that can predict the gait dynamics
and performance of different ankle-exoskeleton assistances. The study will develop and evaluate how ankle-
exoskeleton assistance affects metabolic energy consumption, walking speed, and pain during walking in
healthy young and older adults as well as in older adults with knee osteoarthritis. The candidate will develop
the simulation framework based on a computational neuromechanical human locomotion model he has previ-
ously developed, and collect human gait data using an ankle-exoskeleton emulator developed in his laboratory
to validate the predictions of the framework. In addition to the simulation framework, the study will deliver an-
kle-exoskeleton strategies that can effectively assist healthy young and older adults and those with knee osteo-
arthritis to walk more efficiently, fast, and with less pain. During the K99 phase, the candidate will receive train-
ing in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Stanford University. The mentoring team consists of four
experts who can provide training in experimental human biomechanics, computer simulation of human move-
ment, musculoskeletal diseases in older adults, and gerontology. An advisory committee with three members
will provide additional expertise in optimality principles in human motion, and in non-clinical needs and surgical
trauma in the senior population. The training will prepare the candidate to become a leading independent in-
vestigator in the multidisciplinary fields of motor control and rehabilitation engineering, who produces theoreti-
cal and clinical impacts on improving mobility."

My long-term goal is to become a successfully funded, independent neurobiologist, conducting research aimed
at improving our understanding of learning and memory. This goal will be accomplished by the implementation
of a highly coordinated, thorough, and integrated career development plan including components of mentored
guidance and training, an adept research environment, and a complementary research project. First, a career
development plan comprised of a mentor, and co mentors, courses and conferences has been established to
provide the applicant with the skills and guidance to transition into a position of independence. The mentor, Dr.
Diego Restrepo, is a successfully funded researcher and leading expert in neuroscience and the co-mentor,
Dr. Jamie Peters, is a recognized leader in neural circuits controlling learned behaviors, primarily those
controlling drug seeking and fear in which the prefrontal cortex plays an essential role. They are well suited to
oversee my training. The mentoring team will provide critical guidance and feedback on aspects of career
development and technical components high density electrode recording with Neuropixels, data analysis, and
olfactory behavior tasks. The mentoring committee includes members at different levels of their career ranging
from young to senior faculty who will specifically assist the applicant in components directly related to career
transition. In addition, courses in MATLAB, python and conferences on neuroscience are included to facilitate
these components of the training program. Second, an adept research environment – the Department of Cell
and Developmental Biology at the University of Colorado, along with associated resources, core facilities, and
faculty members not directly involved in the applicant’s advisory committee – is established to provide
assurance of the applicant’s success. Third, a research project has been proposed to facilitate my training in
exciting new areas essential for my path to independence while simultaneously maintaining the key goals of
studying neuronal signaling networks as related to learning and memory. The research tests the important
hypothesis that altering local and long-range interneuron coupling and CaMKIIα-mediated plasticity
mediate changes in PAC that result in an increase in odor elicited change in high gamma phase
reference power and an increase in accuracy for decoding odorant identity during learning in the go-no
go task. Aim 1 will evaluate Closed loop optogenetic stimulation of local PV or SST interneurons or long-range
interneurons targeting hippocampus or mPFC in the peak or through of theta will cause coherence of
oscillatory coupling causing the mice to increase decoding accuracy. Aim 2 will evaluate transient disruption of
CaMKIIα expression in local SST interneurons or long-range interneurons targeting mPFC causes a change in
the transmission of information from the CA1 to mPFC disrupting the ability of these mice to learn to
discriminate odorants. Collectively, this comprehensive career development and research plan will ensure my
successful transition from a dependent research position into one of well-prepared independence."
10821451,"Project Abstract
Mutated clones in hematopoietic cells, also known as clonal hematopoiesis (CH) are present in healthy
individuals and expand with aging. In spite of normal hematopoietic parameters, individuals with CH have
increased risk of myeloid neoplasms, cardiovascular risk and all-cause mortality. We recently showed that the
aged microenvironment contributes to hematopoietic stem cell fate choices. While the presence of clonal
hematopoiesis in healthy individuals has been widely reported, and its expansion with aging is established,
whether the aging microenvironment modifies clonal dynamics and contributes to clonal selection leading to
progression to myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) remains unexplored. Sirtuin6/SIRT6 is a regulator of genome
and epigenome stability. SIRT6 is responsible for more efficient DNA repair in long-lived species. Moreover
SIRT6 plays a critical role in suppressing retrotransposon expression, demonstrating that retrotransposon activity
directly contributes to the progeroid phenotype in mice lacking SIRT6, in part through activation of innate
immunity. Nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) developed as HIV drugs, inhibit retrotransposition,
reduce inflammation, improve aging biomarkers in wild type mice, and extend the lifespan of progeroid mice
lacking SIRT6. We hypothesize that aging-associated de-repression of retrotransposons promotes pro-
inflammatory changes of specific hematopoietic stem cell-supportive niche populations (marrow macrophages
and multipotent stromal cells) which drive clonal progression to myeloid neoplasms. To test this hypothesis,
using relevant models of clonal hematopoiesis we will examine whether 1) pre-leukemic mutations form clones
and progress to MDS more readily in the aged microenvironment by transplanting them into young versus aged
recipient mice; 2) SIRT6 overexpression in key microenvironmental populations slows the rate of
microenvironmental and hematopoietic aging, clonal expansion and progression to MDS; 3) repressing LINE1
retrotranspositions with inhibitors of reverse transcriptases (NRTIs) slows clonal expansion and provides a
mechanism to discover novel microenvironmental regulators of clonal hematopoiesis progression."

Cognitive impairment is a major symptom among patients with post-acute sequelae of COVID-19. Older
individuals and those with dementia risk factors are particularly at risk. In our own prospective study of 4,491
hospitalized COVID-19 patients, the median age was 65 years, 606 (14%) developed new neurological disorders
(most commonly encephalopathy) during hospitalization, indicating a population at high risk for development of
Alzheimer’s Disease or Related-Dementia (AD/ADRD). Of this group, 48% of patients who were cognitively
normal pre-COVID had abnormal telephone MoCA scores (<18) 6-months post hospital discharge. We identified
significant elevations in plasma biomarkers of neurodegeneration/AD including total tau, p-tau-181, UCH-L1,
neurofilament light chain (NfL) and GFAP in hospitalized COVID-19 patients who developed encephalopathy
compared to those who did not. These biomarkers significantly correlated with IL-6, CRP, ferritin and D-Dimer
measures of inflammation. We hypothesize that older subjects with COVID-19, in particular those with
new post-COVID subjective or objective cognitive abnormalities, will have increased plasma and
radiographic AD/ADRD biomarkers, and a greater likelihood of abnormal cognitive testing and
progression to Alzheimer’s disease or related dementias over time. We will enroll 3 groups of patients aged
≥60 years including: 1) SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects who have a new subjective or objective cognitive
symptoms ≤6 month from index SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID+Cog+) 2) SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects without
subjective or objective cognitive symptoms ≤6 month from infection (COVID+Cog-); and 3) SARS-CoV-2
negative, neurologically/cognitively normal subjects, enrolled in the NYU ADRC Clinical Core (Controls). We will
exclude individuals with a history of MCI or AD/ADRD prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our primary outcome will
be the differences in trajectories of global cognition/function (Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes
[CDR-SB]) over the 5-year study across the 3 groups. Secondary outcomes will include: differences in plasma
and radiographic AD/ADRD biomarkers over time compared across the 3 groups. Aim 1: Characterize and
compare cognitive and neuropsychological abnormalities at enrollment and over time (every 12 months), among:
COVID+Cog+, COVID+Cog- and controls using the CDR-SB, and Uniform Data Set Version 3. Aim 2:
Characterize and compare plasma AD/ADRD-related biomarkers of neurodegeneration, inflammation and BBB
dysfunction at enrollment and over time (every 12 months), among COVID+Cog+, COVID+Cog- and controls.
Aim 3: Characterize and compare AD/ADRD neuroimaging biomarkers in COVID+Cog+, COVID+Cog- and
controls at enrollment and over time (every 18 months) using 3T MRI. Collectively, these studies will elucidate
predisposing risk factors and biomarkers for COVID-related cognitive abnormalities, provide mechanistic insights
into underlying pathogenesis, and provide data on long-term outcomes, including the development of AD/ADRD-
related disorders."

We will test Adapt2Quit, an innovative Machine-Learning, Adaptive Motivational Messaging System. Adapt2Quit
uses complex, machine-learning algorithms to adaptively select the best messages for a smoker, based upon
multiple attributes, including: 1) the smoker’s profile; 2) the smoker’s explicit feedback over time to the system;
and 3) data from thousands of prior smokers’ profiles and their feedback patterns. Adapt2Quit’s type of machine-
learning is called a recommender system. Outside healthcare, companies (like Amazon) use recommender
systems to continuously learn from user feedback (e.g.: liked product, products purchased) to improve, thus
enhancing personal relevance and customer engagement. Engagement is a huge challenge for digital health. In
the field of computer-tailored health messaging, Adapt2Quit is the first to use machine-learning to continuously
adapt to feedback and select new personalized messages to send to smokers. To evaluate the impact of the
recommender system, Adapt2Quit will be compared with a robust, active control, a simple but effective
messaging system. In our pilot experiment, Adapt2Quit outperformed the control, especially among socio-
economically disadvantaged (SED) smokers. SED smokers are harder to engage in interventions. Thus,
Adapt2Quit’s increased engagement will be of particular importance for targeting SED smokers. In addition to
the potential impact of the Adapt2Quit messages in inducing and engaging smokers in cessation, our goal is to
increase use of the state Quitline. We will recruit 700 SED smokers at two sites. All smokers will complete a
baseline interview and receive a paper brochure with information about the state’s Quitline. Smokers will then
be randomized to: Adapt2Quit or the standard messaging. As the system is designed to enhance engagement,
and through engagement lead to positive actions, Aim 1 will focus on engagement [Hypothesis (H1a) Among
Adapt2Quit smokers, those with higher engagement levels (completed more ratings) will have greater scores on
the perceived competence scale (PCS)]. Aim 2 compares (Adapt2Quit and control) behavior change processes
including perceived competence for smoking cessation and cessation supporting actions (calling a Quitline)
[H2a: Adapt2Quit smokers will have greater scores on the PCS than control smokers; H2b: Adapt2Quit smokers
will adopt more cessation supporting actions (Quitline, NRT) than control smokers]. Aim 3 will assess
effectiveness of the system [H3a: (primary outcome) Adapt2Quit smokers will have greater smoking cessation
rates (6-month point prevalence biochemically verified) than control smokers; H3b: (secondary outcome)
Adapt2Quit smokers will have lower time to first quit attempt than control smokers; H3c: (mediation analysis)
Measured internal and external processes will mediate the effect of Adapt2Quit on smoking cessation]. To
accomplish the above aims, we have brought together a multidisciplinary team with relevant expertise, and a
strong track record of collaboration."

An animal’s brain consists of interconnected neurons that are responsible for processing sensory information over
many timescales to guide behavior. The function of that brain is determined partially by the animal’s connectome
– the topology, strength, and valence of every connection in its brain. While a draft of the whole connectome for
an animal (the worm Caenorhabditis elegans) has been available for decades, recent work has found that this
connectome varies dramatically through development and between individuals. It is not stereotyped as expected.
We do not know how this large variability in connectivity manifests itself in brain activity through development
or between individuals. Nonetheless, the single connectome an animal has must somehow be able to support
every behavior that the animal may perform in a given instant. Each of these behaviors may engage overlapping
portions of the brain.
 This project aims to leverage calcium imaging to study how whole-brain activity in C. elegans varies through
development and between individuals. Our goal is to clarify precisely how large-scale structure and function
are related in a simple system. To do this, we will perform whole-brain imaging with cellular resolution in a
collection of behaving individual animals as they progress from newly-hatched larvae through a series of molts
and turn into adults. These long-term calcium recordings will be complemented by microfluidic measurements
of whole-brain responses to chemosensory cues at multiple developmental stages. Throughout this process, we
will focus on the following big questions: (1) How does the activity of every neuron in a worm change through
development? (2) How does brain activity vary between genetically identical individuals? (3) How are each of
the above questions affected by changes in environmental context? (4) How does the relationship between brain
activity and connectivity change over development, and how does it vary between individuals?
 If successful, this work could provide unprecedented insight into how brain function changes as an animal
adds neurons, connections, and synapses. It will show how inter-individual and intra-individual variation are
related to the brain’s connectome. This will have immediate value in guiding expectations about how brain activity
and brain wiring are related in other model systems and humans, where direct information about wiring is less
readily available."
10818352,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Repetitive elements (REs) compose ~45% of the human genome and are normally transcriptionally silenced in
somatic cells, although the mechanism had remained elusive. Through a high-content RNAi screen, we identified
the largely uncharacterized protein FBXO44 as an essential repressor of REs in breast cancer cells. FBXO44
bound repressive histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylated (H3K9me3) nucleosomes at the replication fork and recruited
H3K9me3 methyltransferase SUV39H1, ubiquitin ligase CRL4RBBP4/7, and histone deacetylase and chromatin-
remodeling complex Mi-2/NuRD to transcriptionally silence REs post-DNA replication. FBXO44/SUV39H1
inhibition transcriptionally reactivated endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) and retrotransposons (e.g. Alu, LINE-1)
in breast cancer cells, leading to extensive DNA replication stress and stimulation of RIG-I/MDA5-MAVS and
cGAS-STING intracellular antiviral pathways to promote enhanced immunogenicity and decreased
tumorigenicity. In silico analysis revealed the FBXO44/SUV39H1 pathway inversely correlated with DNA
replication stress, antiviral pathways, and cytotoxic T and natural killer (NK) cell infiltration in human breast
tumors. Importantly, FBXO44/SUV39H1 were found dispensable for RE silencing in normal cells and their
inhibition had no effect on H3K9me3 levels, DNA replication stress, or viability, suggesting a therapeutic window.
Our hypothesis is that FBXO44/SUV39H1-mediated RE silencing is an epigenetic vulnerability of breast
cancer cells that could be targeted to inhibit tumor growth/progression and enhance the efficacy of
certain antitumor therapies through the unique mechanism of induced viral mimicry. In this proposal, we
will evaluate 3 potential therapeutic applications of FBXO44/SUV39H1 pathway targeting in the treatment of
estrogen receptor (ER)+ breast cancers based on our preliminary data: 1) prevention of bone metastasis relapse
through stimulation of NK cell recognition and killing of dormant breast cancer cells; 2) enhancement of immune
checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy through stimulation of IFN signaling and intratumoral infiltration of cytotoxic
T cells; and 3) synergy with PARP inhibitors through induction of DNA replication stress and double-strand
breaks (DSBs) at REs. These studies could lead to the development of a safe and effective therapeutic approach
that selectively induces viral mimicry in ER+ breast cancer cells to prevent bone metastasis relapse and enhance
the efficacy of ICB and PARP inhibitor therapies, undoubtedly leading to a significant reduction in disease
mortality."
10818395,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Although next-generation androgen receptor (AR)-targeted therapies have increased survival in
prostate cancer patients, recent studies reveal that exposure to these therapies result in transdifferentiation
to an aggressive neuroendocrine (NE) phenotype in nearly one fifth of cases. The molecular determinants
of lineage plasticity in prostate cancer are poorly understood, and there is an unmet need for non-invasive
methods to study the emergence of treatment-induced lineage plasticity over time. Our team at the
Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) recently developed a novel microfluidic chip, the LPCTC-iChip, for
the high-throughput isolation of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from an entire leukapheresis product, thus
providing a non-invasive alternative to serial tumor biopsies for real-time molecular profiling. In this
extramural-intramural collaborative patient-centric translational research project, we propose to
incorporate the LPCTC-iChip into an NCI intramural clinical trials to investigate NE transdifferentiation in
prostate cancer. The overall objective of this application is to gain insight into the temporal development,
molecular determinants, and clinical impact of NE transdifferentiation by analyzing CTCs in comparison to
matched tumor biopsies from prostate cancer patients in a chemoimmunotherapy trial at the NIH Clinical
Center. Our central hypothesis is that CTC analyses can capture the dynamic lineage state of prostate
cancers during and after therapy, and that immune responses can delay the clinical impact of the NE
phenotype. To attain the overall objective, the following three specific aims will be pursued: 1) Evaluate
matched CTCs and metastatic biopsies from patients with heavily pre-treated metastatic castration-
resistant prostate cancer for hallmarks of NE phenotype; 2) Evaluate serial CTCs in patients with
metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer for NE transdifferentiation during therapy; and 3) Determine
the association between immune responses, NE phenotype, and clinical outcomes. The LPCTC-iChip will
be physically placed at the NIH Clinical Center, and serial CTCs and matched biopsies from mCRPC and
mCSPC patients enrolled in the chemoimmunotherapy study of M7824+M9241+docetaxel
(NCT04633252) will be analyzed for genomic, transcriptional, and protein markers of the NE phenotype.
The proposed research is innovative because it utilizes a novel microfluidic device, the LPCTC-iChip, for
the isolation of CTCs to interrogate a highly relevant problem in prostate cancer. The research is significant
because it is expected to provide a non-invasive alternative to tissue biopsy for monitoring treatment-
induced lineage plasticity, as well as provide a strong scientific framework for the design of future clinical
trials to prevent and treat lethal NE phenotype prostate cancers. This intramural-extramural collaboration
leverages unique resources from MGH and NCI to understand an important disease process, NE
transdifferentiation, with implications for prostate cancer treatment monitoring and therapy."
10818396,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
 CAREER GOAL: My long-term goal is to build a program of research integrating neuroscience,
neuroimaging, behavioral analysis, and genetics to study individual factors that shape vulnerability for
neurodevelopmental disorders and variability in phenotypic expression. Ultimately, I wish to improve outcomes
in children with neurodevelopmental disorders, with a focus on autism spectrum disorder (ASD), by contributing
work to the field that informs the timing and nature of early interventions through elucidation of pathogenic
mechanisms and their developmental time course.
 RESEARCH PROJECT: ASD is highly heritable and the majority of ASD cases are due to inherited,
common polygenic variation. Prospective studies following infant-siblings of older children with ASD, who are at
an increased likelihood of developing ASD themselves, have detailed aberrant brain and behavioral trajectories
beginning as early as 6 months of age in both infants that go on to develop ASD (20%) and 30% of the at-risk
infants who do not develop ASD. This suggests that genetic liability for ASD likely influences brain and behavioral
development in a graded fashion; however, to date, there have been no studies relating quantifiable genetic
liability for ASD to infant development. Given that the first year of life marks a highly plastic period of brain
development that precedes the emergence of the diagnostic features of ASD, determining mechanisms of action
and targeting interventions to this developmental period could yield optimal outcomes. The goal of the current
project is to determine if brain and behavioral development in infancy and toddlerhood are impacted by genetic
liability for ASD, as measured by inherited quantitative autistic traits (QAT) in parents and older probands and
infant polygenic risk scores (PRS) reflecting cumulative risk genes associated with ASD. Additionally, the nature
of associations between brain and behavioral intermediate ASD phenotypes from 6 months to 24 months of age
will be characterized. Specific Aims: (1) To determine if genetic liability for ASD is associated with infant brain
and behavioral development using both (1a) QAT in first-degree relatives and (1b) PRS, and (2) To define
associations between intermediate brain and behavioral phenotypes across early development.
 CAREER DEVELOPMENT: This K01 award will provide me with the necessary training in the areas of
genetic epidemiology and molecular genetics that I require before transitioning to an independent career.

10818482,"Project Summary/Abstract: The 5-hydroxytryptamine 7 receptor (5-HT7R) is a member of the G protein-
coupled 5-HT receptor family. Numerous studies have indicated that 5-HT7R plays a significant role in various
behavioral and psychophysiological functions such as mood stability, cognitive and motor functions, behavioral
inhibition, addictive behaviors, pain tolerance, sleep patterns, appetite, hormonal changes and thermoregulation.
Pre-clinical findings have established the role of 5-HT7R in autism spectrum disorders, Fragile X syndrome
(FXS), epilepsy, sleep disorders, neuropathic pain and migraine. Thus, 5-HT7R is emerging as a potential target
for the treatment of various psychiatric and other associated disorders. Meanwhile, several 5-HT7R agonists,
including AS-19, E-55888, LP-12, LP-44, LP-211, AGH-192 and compound 1g have been reported and their
potential use in various CNS conditions (pain, memory and cognition), neuropathic pain, sleep disorders,
alcohol and drug abuse are being investigated. However, the beneficial effects of activation or blockade of the
5-HT7R in each of these conditions is not often clearly established, primarily due to the lack of selective 5-
HT7R agents. Even more critical is the absence of biased ligands that could clarify several controversial
observations that relate to the 5-HT7R. Thus, our goal to design, synthesize and pharmacologically evaluate
new agents with biased signaling towards G-Protein or β-arrestin signaling pathways hold great promise in
understanding the 5-HT7R and its application to the treatment of various CNS disorders.
 There are three specific aims proposed in this application. Specific aim 1 will focus on extending our
studies on the lead compounds (44080, 55933 and 57544) for their drug-like properties including brain
penetration, pharmacokinetic studies, metabolic profiling, bioavailability assessments and cardiovascular
toxicity predictions (HERG, 5-HT2BR). Based on the metabolic evaluations of lead compound 55933 from our
preliminary studies, the synthesis and screening of new compounds is proposed in specific aim 2. This specific
aim will also focus on the optimization and design of new agents to address the metabolic stability issues such
as aromatization and glucuronidation observed in the preliminary studies. For this reason, aromatization
susceptible tetrahydroisoquinoline (THI) moiety will be replaced with isoindoline which could not undergo
aromatization and the CH2OH group will be replaced with substituents such as -F, -CONH2 to restrict
glucuronidation while maintaining good drug-like characteristics. In addition, bioisosteric replacement of
indanone with dihydronaphthalenone (DNO) moiety will be carried out. Furthermore, exploring the electron
donating/withdrawing (σ values) and hydrophilic/hydrophobic (pi values) space around the THI/isoindoline
ring systems with substituents such as Cl, OMe, CN, SOCH3 and NMe2, will reveal any improvements in their
drug-like characteristics. Simultaneously, docking studies will be carried out using homology models to identify
interactions with the key amino acid residues involved in inducing conformations associated with β-arrestin
recruitment to the 5-HT7R. Specific Aim 3 will cover functional selectivity studies of lead 5-HT7R ligands for
their agonist/antagonist properties and G-Protein or β-arrestin signaling bias followed by evaluation of their
effect on sleep architecture and NREM/REM sleep pattern under in vivo conditions. Finally, selected test
compounds will be compared with SB269970 (5-HT7R antagonist) and compound 1g, a 5-HT7R partial agonist
(as a positive control) for their effect on NREM/REM sleep pattern and correlation of β-arrestin biased activity
using a mice model."
10818483,"Prolonged activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) due to mitotic spindle disruption
can result in p53 activation, centriole disengagement and cell death. Indeed, one
chemotherapeutic strategy frequently applied to aggressive and hormone-independent cancers
is to target the mitotic spindle, a microtubule-based structure that is required for proper
chromosome segregation and cell division. Drugs such as vinblastine or Paciltaxel suppress the
normal microtubule assembly dynamics, leading to mitotic arrest and eventual cell death by
apoptosis. However, despite their decades-long implementation in the clinic, the mechanisms by
which prolonged mitotic delay results in cell death remains unclear. Further, despite the
universality of the requirement of the mitotic spindle for cell division, there is still a great deal of
heterogeneity in how cells respond to spindle disruption, which may reduce the efficacy of anti-
mitotic chemotherapeutic strategies. Using a combination of biochemical and live cell imaging
approaches, our preliminary data reveals that targeting both Kinesin Spindle Protein (KSP), a
molecular motor required for spindle bipolarity, and the Phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase
(PI3K)/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway dramatically accelerates the kinetics of mitotic cell death
relative to mitotic arrest alone. Moreover, it elicits a more homogeneous response from the
treated cells. PI3K signaling is involved in a variety of regulatory pathways that regulate cell
survival, metabolism and proliferation, but the mechanism by which PI3K activity promotes cell
viability during mitotic arrest is unknown. To better understand how PI3K signaling is involved in
the timing of cell death and variability of cellular responses of mitotic delay, we will continue to
apply high-throughput timelapse imaging, high-resolution 4D imaging and biochemical
approaches to a battery of cell lines differ in their sensitivity to mitotic delay as well as
dependence on PI3K signaling. The Specific Aims of this project will 1) Define the protective
role of PI3K in normal and cancer cells; and 2) Determine the mechanism by which PI3K
promotes cell survival during mitotic delay. If successful, these studies will lay the foundation for
future translational studies to further develop adjuvant therapies that will target mitotically active
tumor cells without the side effects associated with other microtubule disruptors."
10818353,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of cognitive impairment, but diseases of cerebral blood
vessels, particularly the small blood vessels that supply all cells of the brain, are also major contributors. No
effective therapies exist, and innovative approaches are needed. The proposed study introduces two conceptual
innovations to identify novel therapeutic strategies. First, the study focuses on cerebral small vessel ischemic
disease (SVID) induced by dyshomeostasis of amylin, an endocrine hormone that participates in the central
regulation of satiety and also known to form pancreatic amyloid in patients with type-2 diabetes. Recent empirical
findings advanced in part by our group suggest that axonal degeneration and maladaptation of small vessels,
such as gliosis, are linked by vascular deposits of amylin. Our preliminary data also show that amylin deposition
in brain capillaries correlates with accumulation of amylin in red blood cells. Working in non-AD rats, we showed
that pancreatic expression of human amylin (rat amylin is non-amyloidogenic) promotes vascular amylin
deposition leading to microhemorrhages, axonal degeneration and late-life onset neurological deficits. Second,
the study introduces a new paradigm that amylin dyshomeostasis modulates brain amyloid composition. Several
laboratories (including ours) report the presence of mixed amylin-β amyloid (Aβ) plaques in brains of individuals
with pathological AD. To study the amylin-Aβ interaction in vivo, we crossed AD rats with human amylin-
expressing rats. Our preliminary data indicate that human amylin-expressing AD rats have accelerated aging
and behavioral changes, whereas genetic or pharmacological suppression of amylin is protective. Here, we
propose to test these hypotheses by using red blood cell lysates, cerebrospinal fluid samples and clinical data
from the MarkVCID study, along with mechanistic studies and amylin-centric therapeutic interventions in rat
models of amylin dyshomeostasis-related dementia. Data derived from the proposed specific aims can directly
lead to human clinical translational studies for the prevention and treatment of vascular cognitive impairment
and/or mixed pathologic disease states that currently lack effective treatments."
10818355,"Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a complex disorder with endocrine, reproductive, and metabolic
features. With a prevalence of 5-15%, it is the most common form of infertility in reproductive age women.
Women with PCOS are also at increased risk of developing obesity, insulin resistance and Type 2 Diabetes.
Consequently, PCOS has a strong negative impact on the health of the population contributing >$5 billion to the
healthcare burden in the US annually. It is characterized by elevated testosterone levels, irregular periods, and
polycystic ovaries. Although PCOS is highly heritable, traditional genetic approaches have identified <5% of all
the genetic variation contributing to this syndrome. Rare genetic variants and regulatory element variation may
account for this “missing” heritability. In an unbiased whole genome sequencing screen of women with PCOS,
we identified missense mutations in the anti-Müllerian hormone gene (AMH). AMH is strong candidate gene for
PCOS. It is critical to two central features of PCOS: ovarian follicle recruitment and development and androgen
production. AMH is elevated in PCOS and has been proposed as a biomarker for PCOS. In follow-up studies, we
identified a total of 37 rare coding and regulatory variants in AMH and its type 2 receptor (AMHR2). These
variants had significantly reduced signaling capacity in 6.7% of our cohort. No variants with impaired activity
were observed in controls and no variants with increased signaling activity were observed in PCOS or
reproductively normal womrn. Our results are highly significant relative to reproductively normal women
(χ2=18.0, p=2.20E-05) and to non-Finnish European population-based controls (p < 10-8). Our findings are
the first identification of functionally validated variants for PCOS and provide strong evidence
for a critical role of the AMH signaling cascade in PCOS. However, to date we have only
comprehensibly screened AMH and its receptor AMH. Given that most genes are believed to
impact disease risk through highly connected cellular networks, it is our overarching hypothesis
that other members of the AMH signaling cascade are also impaired in PCOS To ascertain which
components of the AMH signaling cascade are impaired in PCOS and how they impact PCOS subphenotypes, we
will apply innovative, state-of-the-art genetic, molecular, and bioinformatic approaches. We will create a
comprehensive catalog of putative causal variants in ~30 members of the AMH signaling cascade in multiethnic
PCOS cohort and determined the functional consequences of these variants in PCOS and the general population.
Collectively, these studies will be the first comprehensive evaluation of functional genetic variation of this critical
signaling cascade in PCOS, ii. elucidate the role of members of the AMH signaling cascade in PCOS and female
reproduction in general, and iii. define the molecular mechanisms that underlie phenotypic heterogeneity of
PCOS identifying PCOS subtypes leading to improved treatment options. These studies are thus a critical step
towards the successful implementation of Precision Medicine in the context of PCOS and female reproduction."
10818397,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Approximately 20% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with EGFR mutations harbor atypical
mutations. Unlike NSCLC patients bearing “classical” EGFR mutations (L858R or exon 19 deletions), the patients
with atypical mutations in exon 18 or 20 are resistant to FDA-approved first-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(TKIs), with exon 20 patients presenting response rates of only 4-8% and a median progression free survival
(mPFS) of 2 months based on retrospective studies. Similarly, patients with atypical EGFR exon 18 mutations
have less clinical benefit than patients with classical EGFR mutations when treated with common EGFR- TKIs.
The population impacted by atypical EGFR NSCLC mutations is sizable: approximately 5,000 patients per year
in the US, 41,600 patients per year worldwide, and an even greater number of patients outside of NSCLC. We
recently reported the results of a detailed structural and functional analysis that led to the identification of the
TKI, poziotinib, as a potent and clinically active inhibitor of EGFR and HER2 exon 20 mutant tumors. Based on
this data we have conducted an investigator-initiated phase II trial testing poziotinib in EGFR and HER2 exon 20
mutant NSCLC patients, demonstrating that it is highly active drug for with confirmed objective responses
observed in 43% of patients. This clearly represents an advance for these patients, however, the drug has
significant limitations. Responses to poziotinib treatment were of limited duration, with a mPFS of 5.5 months,
and even less activity was observed in patients with mutations in the “far loop” of exon 20. Whereas patients
with classical EGFR mutations have a mPFS of 18.9 months to osimertinib. Furthermore, many patients receiving
poziotinib experienced >grade 3 adverse events, diarrhea and rash, related to the activity of this drug against
wild-type EGFR, resulting in dose reduction in >60% of patients. To address these limitations, we propose an
integrative analysis to understand the structural features of EGFR exon 18 and 20 mutations, so that more potent
inhibitors can be developed and that specificity for mutant to WT receptor can be enhanced. To achieve this, we
propose the following aims: Aim 1) we will study the structural features of EGFR exon 20 mutations that drive
differential sensitivity to TKIs to guide the development of novel compounds with increased potency. Aim 2) we
will analyze the structural features of atypical EGFR exon 18 mutations to use this information to rationally design
new compounds with enhance efficacy. Aim 3) we will develop novel TKIs with improved EGFR mutant vs wild-
type specificity to augment drug tolerability and clinical benefit of EGFR exon 18 and exon 20 mutant patients.
We have assembled a unique, multi-disciplinary team of physicians, laboratory scientist, structural biologist, and
medicinal chemists with unparalleled pre-clinical and clinical resources for who will work cooperatively to gain
insights into the structural features of EGFR exon 18 and 20 mutant cancers and to translate this into preclinical
and potentially clinical testing. Furthermore, insights gained from this study can help to accelerate efforts
worldwide aiming to target EGFR exon 18 and 20 tumors as well as other EGFR mutant caners."
10818400,"Project Summary/Abstract
In both invertebrate and vertebrate nervous systems, cell recognition molecules control assembly of synaptic
circuits during development. We discovered a network of interacting cell surface proteins (CSPs) through an in
vitro binding (“interactome”) screen for interactions among all Drosophila immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF)
proteins. In this network, 11 DIP proteins in one IgSF subfamily interact with 21 Dpr proteins in another
subfamily, with affinities ranging from 1 µM to 200 µM. Each DIP and Dpr is expressed by a unique subset of
neurons in each area of the developing brain. The connectome of the Drosophila pupal optic lobe (OL) is
assembled by activity-independent mechanisms. DIP::Dpr interactions are important for OL and neuromuscular
system wiring, and loss of individual DIPs or Dprs can alter synaptic connectivity and cause neuronal death. In
this proposal, we address the functions of affinity variation and avidity by examining how changes in DIP::Dpr
binding affinity and expression level affect synaptic terminal development in the neuromuscular system and
synaptic connectivity in the OL. We also examine other interaction networks that may be involved in
determination of the optic lobe connectome. Two such networks are the Beat/Side network of 22 IgSF proteins,
which we also discovered in the interactome screen, and a network of ligands for receptor tyrosine
phosphatases (RPTPs), which are neuronal signaling receptors that regulate axon guidance and
synaptogenesis. We will examine how these three networks work together in vivo to control synaptic
connectivity between specific lamina and medulla neurons in the OL. We will generate a comprehensive map
of interactions and measure binding affinities for all of the Beat/Side proteins using surface plasmon resonance.
To validate interactions in the RPTP network and identify inter-network interactions, we will develop a method
for multiplexed interactome screening using high-avidity 60-mer nanoparticles that may be able to identify
lower-affinity interactions missed in earlier screens. The objectives of the present application are to define how
the affinities of DIP::Dpr interactions affect synaptic connection patterns, to examine how DIPs and Dprs work
together with other families of cell recognition molecules, and to develop improved methods to detect and
characterize in vitro interactions among CSPs. We plan to attain these objectives through three Specific Aims.
Aim 1: Define the functions of DIP::Dpr affinity variation in control of muscle innervation. Aim 2: Examine the
roles of DIP::Dpr affinity and of interplay among cell adhesion and signaling molecules in determination of
synaptic connectivity in the OL. Aim 3: Map in vitro interactions among Beats, Sides, RPTPs, and other CSPs.
The expected outcome of the proposed research will be the acquisition of new insights into the mechanisms by
which interactions among cell recognition molecules control the assembly of neural circuits. This will have a
significant positive impact by increasing our understanding of conserved mechanisms involved in nervous
system development, some of which are affected by disease."
10818586,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Tobacco control policies targeting menthol flavoring could have a significant impact on public health. When
added to cigarettes, menthol increases addictive potential and dependence, leads to greater inhalation of
tobacco toxicants, and decreases the likelihood of cessation. These effects are particularly felt in the African
American (AA) community where targeted marketing has resulted in ≈85% of AA versus ≈20% of White
smokers using menthol cigarettes. The FDA’s decision to advance the rulemaking process to ban menthol
cigarettes is an important step toward closing the gap in tobacco-related disease and death disproportionately
experienced by AA smokers. The agency’s regulatory action stopped short of including menthol-flavored e-
cigarettes (ECs) and debate continues about whether more comprehensive enforcement priorities inclusive of
menthol flavored e-liquids should be enacted. While a ban on menthol flavored EC may reduce youth and
young adult initiation, it may also discourage adult menthol smokers to switch from tobacco cigarettes to EC.
This could slow harm reduction and result in a negative public health impact that would be concentrated in
racial/ethnic minority communities already disproportionately burdened by tobacco. FDA has identified the
impact of EC flavoring on smoking patterns as a research priority area, and there is an urgent need for studies
that examine possible unintended consequences of regulatory actions on tobacco-related health disparities.
Our recently completed randomized clinical trial (RCT) provided menthol EC or tobacco EC to adult smokers.
Among menthol smokers, we found equivalent rates of switching from tobacco cigarettes to EC, tobacco harm
reduction, EC product use, and acceptability between those who used tobacco EC versus menthol EC,
although the study was limited by a small sample size and was not prospectively designed for these
comparisons. These data are consistent with observational studies that have found that nicotine – not flavor –
drive use in adult EC users and provide strong preliminary evidence to support restrictions on menthol flavored
EC given potential benefit to youth and lack of evidence of harm to adult smokers. However, a prospectively
designed and fully powered RCT is needed to empirically answer this question. The objective of this application
is to provide much needed data to the FDA to guide regulatory action on EC flavoring. Menthol smokers (n=800),
stratified by race and gender, who are interested in switching to EC, will be randomized 1:1 into a 12-week open
label, non-inferiority RCT comparing menthol EC versus tobacco EC. Follow-up will continue through week 26.
The central hypothesis is that tobacco EC are not inferior to menthol EC at facilitating a switch to EC in menthol
cigarette smokers. We further hypothesize no difference in tobacco harm reduction, EC product use, or
acceptability between participants randomized to tobacco EC versus menthol EC. The study will provide critical
data to the FDA to inform regulatory action for menthol EC that could slow youth initiation with no resulting
negative impact on switching in adult combustible cigarette smokers."
10818638,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The US FDA has the authority to regulate the manufacture, marketing, and distribution of tobacco products.
Although the Tobacco Control Act banned the sale of cigarettes with characterizing flavors, menthol cigarettes
are currently exempt from this ban, and menthol cigarette use remains a serious public health problem. Use of
menthol cigarettes is associated with greater nicotine dependence and lower rates of quitting smoking, and rates
of menthol cigarette use are highest nationally among Black people, contributing to tobacco-related health
disparities. Evidence suggests that banning menthol flavor in cigarettes would benefit public health. However,
menthol flavor is also available in other tobacco products, such as e-cigarettes, which are the most commonly
used non-cigarette tobacco product among adults. When considering flavor restrictions on tobacco products to
protect public health, the FDA could decide to ban menthol in cigarettes, e-cigarettes, or both products. Research
is needed to understand how availability of menthol (vs. tobacco) flavored e-cigarettes would impact cigarette
use following a ban of menthol cigarettes. The current project will use an established paradigm to model the
impact of these menthol regulatory scenarios on real world smoking behavior. We will recruit 150 adults who
currently smoke menthol cigarettes and will randomize them to 1 of 3 conditions modeling different regulatory
scenarios. We will recruit equal numbers of participants who identify as Black vs. non-Black and will stratify
randomization by race. Participants will be provided with cigarette and e-cigarette products to use for 8 weeks
based on their assigned condition: 1) no menthol ban (menthol cigarette and menthol flavored e-cigarette), 2)
menthol ban in cigarettes only (non-menthol cigarette and menthol flavored e-cigarette), 3) menthol ban in both
cigarettes and e-cigarettes (non-menthol cigarette and tobacco flavored e-cigarette). A follow-up survey at week
12 will assess tobacco use outcomes once the study products are no longer provided. The study aims are to 1)
examine the impact of banning menthol flavor in cigarettes and e-cigarettes on smoking behavior and 2)
investigate whether outcomes differ by race to understand the impact of menthol ban policies on Black (vs. non-
Black) individuals given high rates of menthol cigarette use in this population. The primary outcome will evaluate
changes in the number of cigarettes smoked per day and will examine differences by regulatory scenario. We
will use mixed model analyses to evaluate changes in smoking behavior, regulatory scenario will be a between-
subject factor, and time will be a within-subject factor. Secondary outcomes will compare percent days smoke-
free, changes in nicotine dependence, and motivation, confidence, and intentions to quit smoking by the
regulatory scenarios. We will examine whether changes in the outcomes differ by Black vs. non-Black
participants to compare the magnitude of the effect of the various menthol ban scenarios by race. Results will
contribute critical information to inform regulatory policies regarding menthol in cigarettes and e-cigarettes in
order to maximally reduce the use of combustible cigarettes and promote health equity."

 Three integrated Cores will work in concert to impart LHS scientists with essential knowledge for conducting
rigorous and reproducible PCOR/CER and to effectively implement evidence-based practices within the LHS.
This will begin with intentional recruitment and selection of a diverse group of scientists through a national call,
coordinated by the Administrative Core (AC). The Research Education Core (REC) will guide the development
of the scientists’ knowledge and skills related to LHS competencies and PCORI methodology standards
through a tailored training plan to be carried out over 18 months with a primary mentor and mentoring team.
Experiential learning will involve the design and conduct of a LHS research project with the resources of the
Research and Data Analysis Core (RDAC), including the integration of resulting evidence-based practices into
the LHS. An environment of inclusivity and belonging will be fostered by creating a community of practice
through scientist’s participation in a Learning Collaborative designed to create a cycle of peer-to-peer learning.
 The Center’s specific aims are:
Aim 1: To accelerate the DH LHS through the recruitment and development of a diverse group of embedded
LHS scientists equipped with the knowledge and skills to transform rural healthcare with a focus on the
challenge of timely access to high-quality, equitable, person-centered care in rural settings.
Aim 2: To support embedded LHS scientists through tailored training, mentoring, and experiential learning and
in the conduct of PCOR/CER projects designed to advance rural health equity.
Aim 3: To disseminate knowledge gained within the Dartmouth LHS E-STaR Center throughout our broader
communities and to evaluate the Center’s progress in advancing the DH LHS toward meeting the healthcare
needs of northern New England.
 By growing the LHS scientist workforce, we plan to advance rural health and healthcare equity through the
study and implementation of evidence-based practices designed to make timely, high quality, person-centered,
goal-aligned care accessible to all."

SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assays, one of the two major testing modalities used for diagnosis of COVID-19, are
inherently quantitative. This has led to use of cycle threshold values for determining (a) if a tested individual
remains infectious; (b) whether therapeutic approaches are working in immunocompromised patients; (c)
whether a specific illness is more or less likely to be a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection or some other cause; and
(d) whether a positive PCR test represents a current infection or prolonged detection of residual SARS-CoV-2
RNA that may linger for months after an original infection. Cycle threshold (Ct) values are the first cycle during
PCR amplification during which fluorescence signal crosses a reliable instrument detection threshold.
Unfortunately, Ct values are both assay and instrument specific. In fact, for any given Ct value, viral loads (the
amount of virus in a nasal or nasopharyngeal sample) may vary over one thousand-fold depending on the testing
platform. Traditionally, quantitative PCR assays are calibrated with standards which allow conversion of a test
method-dependent Ct value to a test method-independent viral load. The latter directly reflects the amount of
virus in a sample. Therefore, there is strong impetus to develop calibrators covering the billion-fold range of viral
loads observed in COVID-19 infected individuals. Furthermore, these calibrators should be inexpensive and
accessible to diagnostic and research laboratories. However, currently available calibration standards are very
expensive, available in small quantities, labile, and/or do not reflect the higher viral load levels that identify
infectious individuals and signify ongoing infection in immunocompromised patients. Therefore, here we propose
to develop calibrators that address these needs. We identified the positive-strand RNA Qb bacteriophage as a
compelling vector in which to clone SARS-CoV-2 PCR target sequence for calibrator development. Importantly,
as an encapsidated single-strand RNA calibrator, such Qb derivatives will be able to assess inefficiencies in
extraction, reverse transcription, and amplification phases of PCR tests; are inherently stable; and can be grown
to high titers that encompass the upper range of viral loads observed in specimens. The proposal will examine
the ability of the Qb to tolerate heterologous SARS-CoV-2 PCR target sequence inserted into Qb A1 and RNA-
dependent RNA polymerase genes with or without complementation of phage functionality in trans. Lastly, we
will validate calibrators through interrogation of two major commercial platform diagnostic SARS-CoV-2 PCR
assays, and, as proof-of-principle, use these calibrators as a tool to establish their comparative analytical
measurement range and limit of detection. Taken together, we will establish a new set of inexpensive, readily
available reagents for use by the clinical and scientific community to enhance standardization and rigor of data
available from SARS-CoV-2 PCR diagnostics."
10819169,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common and second most deadly non-cutaneous cancer in men in the
USA, but five-year survival rates approaching 100% are possible if detected early. Prostate MRI has become
increasingly important in cancer detection and localization. Two-dimensional (2D) multislice T2-weighted
spin-echo (T2SE) and diffusion-weighted (DWI) acquisitions are mainstays of clinical prostate MRI, but radi-
ological interpretation is hindered because through-plane resolution is 3–8× coarser than inplane resolution.
This is particularly limiting in the transition zone (TZ) of the prostate where differences in relaxation times
between malignant and normal tissue are small, and interpretation is often based on sharpness-related criteria
such as encapsulation. Per PI-RADSv2.1, T2SE is the critical sequence. Reported sensitivity is far less than
ideal, 30 to 70%. In addition to the specific need for improved diagnostic accuracy in the TZ, there is an
initiative to make prostate MRI exams shorter and more efficient. Thus, there is a need to reconcile these
competing demands of improved resolution and contrast via reduced partial volume effects with higher effi-
ciency in prostate MRI. We have developed a super resolution (SR) method for T2SE which uses overlapped,
standard-thickness (3mm) axial slices to form 1mm slices with reconstruction in kZ-space, dubbed kZ-multislice
(KZM). We have shown in vivo the superior sharpness of the resultant images vs. 3mm slices for equal
inplane resolution. More recently we have developed methods which virtually eliminate the slice-to-slice in-
consistency disrupting current KZM reconstruction and degrading image quality. Our central hypothesis is
that this KZM approach shown in feasibility studies can now be markedly improved technically to simultane-
ously provide improved through-plane resolution and allow reduced scan time, resulting in an efficient tech-
nique enabling improved performance of clinical prostate T2SE and DWI MRI. We propose to:
1. Develop techniques for rapid, high quality, multislice acquisition suitable for SR prostate T2SE. We will
incorporate non-traditional RF excitation pulses for improved fidelity in kZ. We will use simultaneous multi-
slice (SMS) to reduce scan time and statistical reconstruction to retain SNR. We will develop means to
measure the small, 1-2 mm A/P prostate motion during the scan, allowing accurate motion correction.
2. Extend the SR methodology developed for T2SE to DWI of the prostate. Segmented acquisition will provide
for slice-to-slice positional consistency. SR reconstruction will be tuned to the individual b-values used. Sta-
tistical reconstruction will retain SNR, allowing thin-slice images of the ADC.
3. Apply SR techniques to multislice prostate MRI. We will evaluate our technical developments in clinical
evaluations, comparing conventional T2SE with our new SR method for a Super Abbreviated Exam (SAE).
We will also evaluate our T2SE KZM method on improved accuracy in detecting PCa in the transition zone."

Localized prostate cancer is often categorized as either indolent or aggressive based largely on
clinical and pathological features. Despite our understanding of genetic alterations that are
associated with different stages of prostate cancer (PCa), there is no clear molecular classification
system, which can predict the risk for developing aggressive PCa. As a result, it is currently
difficult to discriminate the aggressive and indolent PCa in their early stages, and develop
appropriate therapy for the patients with aggressive cancer. Surgery, radiation and less often
androgen deprivation therapies are the available treatment options for localized tumor, although
cancers of 30-35% of patients recur and some of them evolve into metastatic disease. There are
very limited treatment options for advanced stage PCa. It is therefore important to identify the
molecular mediators that promote the advancement of PCa. A comprehensive knowledge on the
function of these mediators will not only help us to determine the molecular factors that can
distinguish the aggressive and indolent PCa but also to establish effective treatment modalities
for those patients who are at high risk to develop metastatic cancer. Our preliminary results
indicated that Neuropilin-2 (NRP2) could be a mediator of aggressive PCa by regulating the global
transcription of genes required for cancer promotion. Mechanistically, NRP2 can translocate from
ER to nuclear membrane through retrograde transport and stabilize the transcription machineries
necessary for the expression of cancer promoting genes. Based on these novel observations, we
hypothesized that nuclear NRP2 is critical for the transcription of genes required for the
advancement of PCa. Hence, NRP2 is not only a predictor for aggressive PCa but also a target
for effective treatment strategy. Two specific aims have been proposed. In aim 1, we will study
the underlying mechanisms of how nuclear membrane-bound NRP2 interacts with the
transcription factors in PCa cells and facilitates their activity. We will also determine using a cohort
of human PCa tissues whether nuclear NRP2 can be a prognostic factor, which can discriminate
between indolent and aggressive PCa. Aim 2 will focus on the molecular mechanism of how
NRP2 migrates to nuclear membrane and determine whether inhibition of this translocation can
block the prostate tumor growth. Altogether, our proposal will determine how nuclear NRP2
promotes PCa and thus can be an effective predictor for aggressive PCa. Moreover, it will identify
whether targeting NRP2 axis such as blocking its nuclear transport is an effective therapeutic
approach to treat aggressive PCa."
10819205,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Cleft palate patients (1:1000 live births) all undergo palate repair; however, 60% de-
velop complications including oronasal fistula (ONF) formation. ONF formation leads to poor feeding and
speech. Cleft palate repair involves rotating palate mucosal flaps into the cleft and healing is affected by physi-
cal trauma from the tongue and a bacteria laden environment. Currently, cleft palate repair surgeries lack a
regenerative reconstructive option, require multiple re-repairs due to ONF and increase cost and morbidity.
Surgeons use allograft dermal implants, despite the risk of HIV/prion transmission, to act solely as a barrier to
reduce ONF. Our group has developed a novel murine phenocopy of ONF, and identified a unique immuno-
modulatory approach to directing the ONF healing process in a pro-regenerative program. FTY720, an active
biolipid, targets the sphingosine pathway to preferentially attract pro-regenerative monocytes and macrophag-
es to improve ONF healing. Our long-term goal is to develop an immunoregenerative approach to improve pal-
ate wound healing. The overall objective in this application is to determine the mechanism of ONF healing and
use FTY720 nanofibers to tune the monocyte and macrophage migration in a pro-regenerative fashion. The
central hypothesis is that inflammatory monocytes and macrophages are the predominant response during oral
cavity wound healing and that delivery of FTY720 preferentially attracts pro-regenerative monocytes and mac-
rophages leading to improved wound healing. FTY720 signals through the sphingosine pathway, increasing
the recruitment of pro-regenerative monocytes and macrophages. The rationale for the proposed research is
that a comprehensive and mechanistic understanding of the inflammatory response during ONF formation will
provide therapeutic targets aimed at altering pro-regenerative monocyte migration. Guided by strong prelimi-
nary data, including a paper demonstrating significant reduction in ONF following FTY720 nanofiber delivery,
the hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Determine the requirement, timing and mecha-
nistic contributions of the inflammatory response during ONF formation; 2) Engineer a nanofiber scaffold to
provide controlled delivery of FTY720 to improve oral cavity wound healing using an immunoregenerative ap-
proach. In Aim 1 we will identify the critical inflammatory cell recruitment to healing ONF, determine the re-
quirement of monocytes, and identify alteration in the cytokines and reparative gene pathways following ONF
formation. In Aim 2, we will test the optimal FTY720 delivery strategy, the ability of FTY720 nanofiber to direct
pro-regenerative ONF wound healing with and without monocytes, and determine the effects of FTY720 nano-
fiber on the cytokines and reparative gene pathways. The proposed research is innovative by mechanistically
describing monocyte migration in an ONF murine model that allows testing of immunomodulatory strategies.
The proposed research is significant because it that FTY720, an FDA-approved drug approved to treat multiple
sclerosis, could be fast tracked to clinical trials to reduce ONF formation."
10819206,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Gram negative bacteria are the most common pathogens implicated in nosocomial pneumonia in critically ill
patients. Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP) in particular has grown in prominence worldwide with increasing
prevalence of antibiotic resistance, hypervirulent strains, and invasive clinical syndromes. Mechanisms of host
defense responsible for effective clearance of KP infection from the lung in susceptible hosts are still unclear.
Cis-aconitate decarboxylase 1 (Acod1) is a mitochondrial enzyme robustly induced in murine and human alveolar
macrophages that catalyzes the production of itaconate. Itaconate suppresses inflammatory responses through
a proposed Nrf2-dependent mechanism. The goal of this proposal is to define the role of myeloid-derived
itaconate in pulmonary host defense during KP infection and to determine how it confers protection from local
tissue injury. In a murine model of pneumonia using KP as the pathogen, we have shown that Acod1 deficiency
is associated with decreased survival and increased bacterial dissemination. We have also shown that itaconate
depletion reduces expression of key proteins of the cellular integrated stress response (ISR) pathway during ER
stress, suggesting that it may regulate this pathway. Our proposal will address the following specific aims: 1) To
determine if myeloid cell-derived itaconate limits local KP infection and protects against extrapulmonary sepsis;
and 2) To determine whether itaconate is host-protective through the ISR and decreases cellular injury during
KP infection. We hypothesize that Acod1, and thus itaconate production, is protective against sepsis and
associated tissue injury in this model and increases host resilience. We also anticipate that macrophage-derived
itaconate increases protection from ER stress both in macrophages and lung epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo.
These studies will utilize in vitro and translational tools including an in vivo intrapulmonary KP infection model
using wild-type and Acod1-/- mice, bone marrow chimeras, RAW 264.7 macrophage cell lines (wild-type and
Acod1-/-), human and mouse precision-cut lung tissue slices, and human alveolar macrophages to address our
research questions. In addition, we will perform transcriptomic and metabolomic profiling across affected tissues
during disseminated KP infection, immunophenotype myeloid subsets, and execute complementary cell biology
studies to examine key targets of the integrated stress response pathway in the presence or absence of itaconate
in myeloid and epithelial cells. This work will elucidate novel immune mechanisms that may be exploited to
reduce mortality associated with this pathogen. The proposal incorporates a strong mentorship team led by Dr.
Janet Lee as Director of the Acute Lung Injury Center of Excellence and a robust career development plan.
Support of this proposal with a K08 Career Development Award will establish a foundation for success and
independence for the candidate as a physician-scientist in pulmonary and critical care medicine."

Despite advances in early detection and treatment, breast cancer remains a major cause of
morbidity and mortality in women and prevention a major unmet need. Non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), including aspirin (ASA), are among the most widely used drugs
for minor pain and arthritis that demonstrate anti-tumor activity. Based on epidemiological data,
low dose ASA is under investigation in clinical trials for the prevention of breast cancer
recurrence. We were previously funded to perform a clinical trial of the NSAID, sulindac (SUL)
at 150 mg BID, in postmenopausal women receiving aromatase inhibitor therapy as part of their
breast cancer care. In an interim analysis, SUL significantly reduced breast density determined
by MRI compared to an observation, control group after 12 months. Further, SUL reduced
collagen straightness in breast tissue by second harmonic generation microscopy (SHG)
microscopy and the change was significantly correlated with a decrease in breast density.
Additional MRI based imaging of breast adipose tissue suggest novel SUL effects consistent
with effects on anti-inflammatory/anti-tumor M2 type macrophages in adipose. SUL is a unique
pro-drug with cyclooxygenase (COX) and non-COX activities. Because of unique anti-cancer
activity in preclinical models and clinical trials, SUL has been studied for more than two decades
and recently granted Fast Track Status by the FDA in combination with CPP-1X for approval as
a chemoprevention agent for patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. Activity of SUL in
preclinical models to prevent epithelial cancers support similar anti-cancer action in the breast.
Our new data extend the preclinical findings to effects on breast density; an established risk
factor for breast cancer. Here we propose to follow our promising preliminary data with the
natural next step of a randomized, open label 3 arm study of SUL 150 mg BID, ASA 325 mg QD
and no treatment control in postmenopausal women at increased risk of developing breast
cancer. We will test the hypothesis that SUL at 150 mg BID for 12 months will significantly
lower breast density in at-risk women and be superior to ASA, a cheaper, more accessible, and
perhaps safer NSAID. Secondarily, paired breast biopsies (baseline and after 6 months) will be
used to test the hypothesis that SUL effects on breast density are partly mediated through
effects on breast tissue collagen alignment and collagen expression using highly innovative
SHG and whole tissue slide matrix assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI)-mass
spectrometry. In addition, we will explore SUL and ASA effects on breast adipose including
novel hypotheses that their action is in part mediated through activity on macrophages in breast
tissue."
10819225,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Peptide macromolecules represent the mainstay of treatment for conditions affecting hundreds of millions
of people across the globe. For example, insulin is the mainstay of treatment for many patients with diabetes
mellitus. In addition, several inflammatory autoimmune disorders (such as Inflammatory Bowel Disease – IBD,
systemic lupus erythematosus – SLE, rheumatoid arthritis – RA, and others) are often treated with monoclonal
antibodies (mAbs), such as infliximab or adalimumab. Both insulin and these mAbs are peptide macromolecules
and, as such, cannot be given by an oral route, instead requiring injection or infusion.
Intravenous and injectable delivery routes have been shown to have several critical downsides when
compared to oral delivery. First, patients have shown less compliance towards injectables, leading to subsequent
complications, escalating costs and worse outcomes. In addition, injectable medications are often associated
with complications (such as infection ranging from localized to sepsis, local tissue damage, thrombosis, allergic
reactions ranging from infusion reactions to anaphylaxis, and others). Furthermore, some of these regimens
require sterilization, storage, and administration in a medical setting, which is not readily available in some parts
of the world and if available, result in escalating cost to insurance payers and by extesion the healthcare system
and patients. The net effect is ultimately measured in higher price, and lower outcomes.
 Peptide macromolecules cannot be given orally because their (1) inactivation by pH and proteases in the
GI tract, and (2) negligible transport across the tight epithelial cell junctions in the intestine due to their large size
(5-150 kDa or more). Here we propose to develop a platform of drug delivery that is composed of (A) a capsule
that is swallowed, and that contains (B) multiple millimeter scale, autonomous microrobots (theragrippers) that
can carry the active peptide macromolecule drug, latch onto the GI mucosa and inject their active drug load into
the systemic circulation. We are developing the oral capsule as part of other efforts and will focus here on
developing theragrippers for peptide macromolecule delivery trans-intestinal mucosa to the systemic circulation.
 The proposal is built on 10+ years of successful and productive collaboration between the labs of Dr.
Selaru (gastroenterologist, scientist) and Dr. Gracias (engineer, scientist) at Johns Hopkins. The original
concept, as well as first-generation design and manufacturing of the theragrippers are a result of this
collaboration. The project has been supported in part by the NIBIB through an R01 (2014-2018) and a renewal
R01 (2018 - 2022). The current proposal builds on the prior results, brings compelling preliminary data, and
seeks a renewal R01 to validate the innovative hypothesis outlined here. The successful development of this
project will affect not only patients with insulin-dependent diabetes and autoimmune inflammatory conditions but
may be generalizable to other parenteral treatments as well."

 Central nervous system (CNS) inflammation as a result of viral infection, tissue injury, or autoimmunity is
associated with recruitment of various B cell subsets ranging from naïve, isotype class unswitched, isotype
switched memory B cells (Bmem) and antibody secreting cells (ASC). ASC have been a major focus of research
due to their reactivity to autoantigens in multiple sclerosis (MS), neuromyelitis optica and Ab encephalitic
diseases. However, beyond Ab secretion B cells are important modulators of immune responses by serving as
antigen presenting cells, producing pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, and participating in formation of tertiary
lymphoid structures (TLS) in non-lymphoid organs. TLS exacerbate local immune responses during chronic
inflammation. Their presence in the meninges correlates with subpial cortical demyelination and disability
progression in MS. An underlying feature of TLS is the activation of meningeal stromal cells, including follicular
reticular cells (FRC) which provide a structural network guiding leukocyte accumulation and orchestrating CNS
immune responses. Activated FRC are marked by upregulation of the mucin-type transmembrane protein PDPN,
lymphoid chemokines CXCL13, CCL19 and CCL21, extracellular matrix (ECM) and integrins, such ICAM-1,
which together support immune cell interactions in stromal niches. While some chronic inflammatory diseases
including MS are associated with sustained activated FRC dependent TLS formation, CNS viral infection elicits
transient FRC activation with no evidence for TLS despite ongoing inflammation during viral RNA persistence.
Context dependent plasticity and/or heterogeneity of FRC is supported by tissue and insult specific mediators of
stromal network activation and stabilization to form chronic TLS in distinct models. The mechanisms underlying
transient versus chronic meningeal FRC network activation and TLS during CNS infections remain
unexplored. The goal of this proposal is to define how B cell/stromal cell interactions shape adaptive antiviral
immune responses during acute and persistent infection established by neurotropic coronavirus. The Specific
Aims are to determine 1) the role of early CNS accumulating B cells in promoting meningeal stromal cell
activation and 2) signals sustaining CNS stromal cell activation and effects on local B cell differentiation and
diversity as well as control of viral persistence. We will test the hypothesis that IgD+ B cells participate in LTβR
dependent FRC activation by using select blocking approaches to define mediators activating stromal cells (anti-
PDPN and -CD20 treatment, LTβR blockade and cell type specific LTβ ablation) during acute infection. Aim 2
tests the hypothesis that sustaining FRC activation with distinct immune modulators during viral control retains
recruited B cells in stromal niches, thereby promoting local B cell maturation. A better understanding of reciprocal
FRC/B cell interactions within defined microenvironments will impact strategies to remodel FRC networks to
improve antimicrobial function, while minimizing pathological consequences."

Cigarette smoking causes cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and lung
cancer. The etiology of diseases caused by exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) is confounded by
the complexity of ETS as a mixture of >4000 chemicals, including direct-acting and metabolically-activated
toxicants. While all organisms respond to environmental exposures by regulating gene expression, we know little
about the translational mechanisms linking toxicant exposure to cell survival and disease. Here we seek to
understand the role of the dozens of modified ribonucleosides in tRNA – the tRNA epitranscriptome – in
regulating the cell response to ETS exposure. Using a unique computational and analytical platform, we have
shown that (1) toxicant exposures cause signature changes in the epitranscriptome of yeast and mammalian
cells, and (2) that toxicant-induced reprogramming of the tRNA epitranscriptome regulates protein levels by
promoting the selective translation of codon-biased mRNAs from families of stress-response genes in yeast. Our
studies in bacteria, yeast and mammalian cells1-7 also show that deficiencies in key epitranscriptomic writer
enzymes sensitize cells to killing by specific toxicants due to corrupted translation of stress response proteins.
We hypothesize that exposure to the complex mixture of ETS will reprogram the tRNA epitranscriptome
to reflect the predominant chemical stressors in ETS and that the altered RNA modifications will regulate
cell behavior by selective translation of codon-biased stress response mRNAs. In support of this, we have
observed agent-specific epitranscriptome reprogramming in the liver from rats exposed to drugs and toxicants
(e.g., arsenic; NTP DrugMatrix), and alkylation- and oxidation-specific signature tRNA modification changes in
yeast and human cells. Our epitranscriptomic writer-deficient (Alkbh8-null) mice showed that tRNA modification
systems required for translating oxidant-detoxifying selenoproteins are vital to surviving exposure to
naphthalene, a P450-activated, oxidant-generating, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) in ETS. In three aims
ranging from in vitro studies in cultured mouse cells to a mouse ETS exposure model, we test the idea that the
epitranscriptome and translational regulation play an important role in the cell response to ETS.

Globally, more than 3.5 million people are infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). In the United States, due to the
opioid epidemic, HCV cases have increased, especially among adults under 30. However, few young people
who inject drugs (PWID ≤30 years old) – who are at the center of the HCV epidemic in the US – are benefiting
from curative HCV therapy. A potentially promising, yet untapped avenue for increasing HCV treatment among
PWID is the leveraging of their injecting partners to successfully navigate the multiple obstacles between
diagnosis and treatment. Our team’s extensive research with dyads identified a potential action-point within
injecting partnerships that can be harnessed through behavioral intervention. Quantitative findings identified
specific injecting related interpersonal factors (i.e., trust, intimacy, cooperation) associated with increased
health and safety for injecting partnerships. Followed by qualitative results that in combination with
interpersonal factors, partner involvement (i.e., emotional, tangible, affectionate, and positive social support)
enhances a partnership’s ability to coordinate behavior (dyadic capacity). Interpersonal factors with partner
involvement was found to overcome barriers to HCV treatment.
Building on our extensive foundation of dyadic research and dyadic behavior change theories, we developed
the Partner Navigation Intervention a two-session injecting partnership intervention to enhance dyadic
capacity for HCV treatment initiation for young adult PWID. The proposed study is a randomized controlled
study (RCT) to assess the efficacy and mechanism of action of the first behavioral intervention to increase
HCV treatment initiation among young adult PWID. In partnership with our community-based HCV testing
organizations (CBOs), we will randomize young adult PWID with recently diagnosed HCV infection (250
partnerships, n=500) and their primary injecting partner to intervention or standard of care. Scalability was core
to the design of the two-session intervention. Session 1 expands on standard-of-care HCV infection diagnosis
counseling with counselor-led discussion with the HCV positive PWID to identify situational and personal
barriers to HCV treatment and identify an injecting partner to aid in their HCV treatment navigation. Session 2
is a dyad session with both the young adult PWID and their injecting partner. A counselor facilitated discussion
will develop strategies to respond to the identified HCV treatment initiation barriers and partnerships practice
strategies and concretize a plan involving both partners for addressing barriers, including a timeline and
potential alternative strategies in treatment navigation. During both sessions the counselor records key
information discussed onto a paper handout (Partner Navigation Map) serving as the intervention tool. A

Subretinal fibrosis, an end-stage fibrous scar of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD),
compromises highly organized anatomical layers and tightly coordinated cellular interactions, inevitably leading
to irreversible visual impairment. The current treatment for subretinal fibrosis is limited and therefore, new
therapeutic strategies for the inhibition of subretinal fibrosis are imperative.
 Multiple cell types, including endothelial cells (ECs), retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells, macrophages
and glial cells, contribute to subretinal fibrosis by either differentiating into mesenchymal-like cells and further
differentiating into α-smooth muscle actin-positive myofibroblasts and/or producing profibrotic and
proinflammatory factors. However, the underlying mechanisms for these cellular and molecular activities remain
poorly defined. Adenosine receptor 2A (Adora2a) has been implicated in various vascular diseases and
inflammation. Our preliminary data here show that (i) the level of Adora2a expression was increased in subretinal
lesions of laser-induced CNV in mice; (ii) the size of subretinal fibrosis was markedly decreased in lesions of
laser–induced CNV in Adora2a-deficient mice; (iii) endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) occurred to
choroidal ECs (CECs) and EndMT participated in the formation of subretinal fibrosis in laser-induced mouse
CNV; (iv) Tgfb2-induced EndMT was decreased for Adora2a-deficient CECs; (v) macrophage-to-myofibroblast
transition (MMT) in laser-induced subretinal fibrotic lesions was markedly reduced in Adora2a-deficient mice; (vi)
Adora2a-deficient bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) had a compromised production of profibrotic
factors after stimulation with Tgfb2; and (vii) the levels of hypoxia-inducible factor (Hif) 1a or 2a dynamically
correlated with those of Adora2a in the above pathological alterations. Thus, we hypothesize that Adora2a-
mediated Hif signaling in CECs and infiltrated macrophages enhance fibrotic effects leading to increased
formation of fibrotic lesions in CNV. To test our hypothesis, we have generated mice with inducible global
Adora2a deficiency in Vldlr-/- mice, endothelial lineage tracing mice, inducible endothelial Adora2a deficiency in
C57BL/6j mice, and myeloid Adora2a deficiency in C57BL/6j mice. We established an ex vivo approach to culture
mouse CECs and in vitro approaches to generate BMDMs. We will investigate the effect of Adora2a inactivation
in CECs and myeloid cells in subretinal fibrosis using specific genetic and pharmacological tools and assess
subretinal fibrosis using an integrated approach of in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro models. Our study will define the
role of Adora2a in the development of subretinal fibrosis and provide the basis for using ADORA2A inhibition as

Through the training outlined in this K23 award, Dr. Brian Stagg will become an independent investigator in
health services research using health information technology to decrease glaucoma blindness by enhancing
clinical decision making for glaucoma to ensure that patients receive appropriate glaucoma care.
CANDIDATE BACKGROUND: Dr. Stagg is an Assistant Professor specialized in glaucoma at the University
of Utah. Following ophthalmology residency, he completed a 2-year health services research fellowship at the
University of Michigan and earned a Master of Health and Healthcare Research degree, followed by a
glaucoma fellowship at Duke University. He has background experience in health services research, healthcare
delivery research, data science, and biostatistics. CAREER DEVELOPMENT PLAN: To succeed as an
independent investigator, Dr. Stagg needs additional training in: (1) Clinical Decision Support (CDS) system
workflow and implementation research, (2) CDS system design and human factors research, (3) CDS system
EHR integration using health informatics standards, and (4) research leadership and grant writing. The
training and mentorship outlined in this K23 will give Dr. Stagg this needed expertise. MENTORS: Through
the supportive research and mentorship environment at the University of Utah and his connections with
mentors from the University of Michigan and Duke University, Dr. Stagg has put together an innovative
interdisciplinary mentoring and advising team lead by Dr. Rachel Hess, his primary mentor. CLINICAL
PROBLEM: Up to 30% of patients who are actively treated for glaucoma continue to have significant visual
field loss and need intensification of treatment to lower eye pressure and prevent further loss. Proper
identification and management of such progressive visual field loss is vital to prevent blindness from
glaucoma. This is a challenge for clinicians caring for patients with glaucoma as they must incorporate large
amounts of longitudinal data from many data sources accurately and efficiently. Optimized, workflow-
appropriate CDS systems can help address this challenge. CDS systems present information to clinicians at the
point of care to improve decision making. SPECIFIC AIMS: Dr. Stagg will (Aim 1) understand differences
between ophthalmologic specialists and generalists in glaucoma clinical decision-making workflow and
workload, (Aim 2) iteratively refine the Glaucoma CDS System and evaluate its efficacy in a pre-clinical
setting, and (Aim 3) integrate the Glaucoma CDS System with the EHR and pilot for feasibility and usability in
clinics to deliver personalized recommendations to clinicians for visual field testing frequency. The completion
of these aims will result in (1) a rigorously developed, user-centered, scalable CDS system to help clinicians
determine a personalized visual field testing frequency for patients with glaucoma and (2) generalizable
knowledge that will support future CDS development for glaucoma and other eye conditions."
10808197,"Suicide is the second leading cause of death among 10-34 year-olds. Aligning with the NIMH's Prioritized
Agenda for Suicide Prevention Research, this K23 career development award seeks to advance what is known
about the brain/behavior mechanisms underlying self-critical rumination ─ defined as persistent negative-self-
evaluation ─ and self-reassurance ─ providing compassion to self. This K23's central hypothesis is that
circuit alterations in the dorsolateral and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, dorsal anterior cingulate, and insula
underlying self-critical rumination and self-reassurance is associated with increased suicidal thoughts and
behavior (STB) in adolescents. Our central methodology is to examine self-critical rumination and self-
reassurance using task-dependent and task-independent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and
ecological momentary assessment (EMA) in 90 12-15 year-old girls recruited on the range of STB. This age
group represents a critical developmental period for these self-referential processes and youth in this age-
group experienced a sharp increase in suicide rates over the last decade. Our focus on only girls is due to
greater prevalence of self-criticism among females compared to males, but we plan to examine potential sex-
differences in future studies. This K23's research goals are to: (i) test the associations between in vivo self-
critical rumination, self-reassurance, and STB; (ii) identify neural mechanisms underlying self-critical rumination
and self-reassurance; (iii) integrate the findings from the scanner with STB assessed in adolescents' real world
environment. This K23's career development goals are to gain hands-on mentorship with (i) task-dependent
and task-independent fMRI to assess circuit function; (ii) EMA for better real-world assessment of self-critical
rumination and self-reassurance; (iii) statistical approaches for imaging and EMA data; (iv) professional
development and collaboration skills. This K23 is significant, because identifying specific neural mechanisms
underlying the interplay between self-critical rumination, self-reassurance, and STB can help ascertain which
teens are at a greater risk for STB and contribute to development of novel, mechanistically-informed
interventions. This study, combined with the completion of proposed training goals, will effectively propel the
candidate towards establishing an independent program of research focused on identifying bio-behavioral
mechanisms and developing preventative interventions for youth suicide risk. This K23 is innovative because
this will be the first project to identify specific neural mechanisms of self-critical rumination and self-
reassurance in adolescents focusing on: (i) identifying construct-specific neural mechanisms; (ii) a trans-
diagnostic sample of teenagers selected on the range of STB; (iii) integration of imaging and EMA techniques.
The proposed mentors (Drs. Dickstein, Armey, Jones, and Brick) and consultants (Drs. Price and Maratos)
have extensive experience to support the proposed training goals. The Department of Psychiatry and Human
Behavior at Brown University is an outstanding environment for the proposed training and research."

The primary objective of this proposal is to characterize the most important genetic and proteomic pathways
that contribute to early stages of pulmonary fibrosis (PF_, with the goal of developing biomarkers for, and
improving our understanding of, the initial biological processes that result in early PF pathogenesis. Idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), the most common and severe form of PF, is increasing in prevalence, and has a
mortality rate worse than most malignancies. Given that even early stages of PF may benefit from interventions
there is more urgency to improve our understanding of early disease detection and to define the most
important pathways that result in early stages of PF progression. In the prior grant cycle, key results helped to
improve our understanding of early progressive PF, demonstrated the key genetic and genomic findings that
overlap, and that are distinct from, IPF, and identified important genomic findings correlated with early stages
of PF. Although these results provide important biologic signals, the predictive power of many of these
biomarkers is low, and they leave important questions unanswered. We hypothesize that comprehensive
proteomic and genetic assessments of ILA will lead to a better understanding of 1) the factors that best help
predict disease risk, 2) the most important pathways implicated in PF development, and 3) which proteins’
secretion is increased in response to higher risk genetic profiles thus implicating their role in early PF
pathogenesis. To address these hypotheses, we propose the following specific aims: Aim 1: Can peripheral
blood proteins be identified that are associated with, and help to predict, early and later stages of progressive
PF? Aim 2: Can polygenic risk scores (PRS) help predict early stage-stage PF and can this genetic data be
integrated with proteomic assessments to improve our understanding of early PF pathogenesis? Aim 3: Can
differentiated human airway epithelial cells (HAECs) demonstrate the role that high genetic risk (and
environmental stimuli) play in the expression of early-stage PF associated proteins? These results will not only
improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of both early and late stage PF, but will also identify candidate
pathways that could lead to targets for drug development, and will identify biomarkers for future interventional
trials designed to target those at the highest risk to develop IPF at a stage before the lung is irrevocably
damaged."
10801176,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
High sedentary behavior (SB) increases risk for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease (CVD),
cancer, and type 2 diabetes. However, mixed evidence on how much to limit SB or how to break up
SB to reduce its negative health impacts has inhibited specific quantified SB guidelines The ubiquity
of wearable sensors, able to collect data at fine granularity (e.g., 30Hz), enables rich, nuanced SB
assessment. Computational methods to accurately quantify SB accumulation patterns (e.g., long
uninterrupted bouts of SB versus fragmented SB with numerous breaks) are needed. Building on our
previous work, in this project we will implement deep learning methods to derive posture-based
SB measures for the widely used ActiGraph sensor from raw accelerometer (at 30 Hz
granularity) or processed count outputs from hip- or wrist-worn devices across a broad range
of population groups (Aims 1, 2). We will develop a deep-learned convolution neural network
(CNN) bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) model. We will use extensive training and
held-out testing to reduce overfitting and improve accuracy and reproducibility on future samples. To
develop our models, we will leverage data from seven existing separately funded studies
comprising 6390 unique free-living individuals with hip- or wrist-accelerometer data (>200,000
hours of device wear), and concurrent criterion posture assessment. We will apply deep transfer
learning, novel in SB research, which exploits the basic neural architecture of an existing model, and
finetunes it for a new cohort or application. Deep transfer learning can markedly reduce computational
complexity and avoids the need for large criterion datasets. We will apply our new classifiers to
quantify SB from hip- and wrist-worn ActiGraphs for participants from the NHANES and WHISH
Studies (N= 42,496), and evaluate cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between SB
patterns and cardiometabolic health in youth and adults (Aim 3). Enabling use of a single device,
i.e., the ActiGraph, to obtain posture-based SB metrics, as well as energy-expenditure based physical
activity measures, will obviate the need for multiple devices, and improve participant compliance. Our
publicly available algorithms and accurate SB metrics will advance SB research, allowing researchers
to transfer our models to other cohorts, enabling specific quantified public health SB guidelines
(similar to physical activity guidelines) and laying the foundation for future development of self-
monitoring tools for clinicians or interventionists to personalize SB goals for their patients, and
facilitate SB change."
10801239,"Since the pioneering work of Hubel and Wiesel, the mammalian visual cortex has been
used as a model for the rest of the cerebral cortex. In spite of this, little is known about
the detailed operations of its microcircuits. In fact, the cortex is composed of more than a
hundred cell types, and it is likely that each cell type has a particular circuit function.
 In a recently ended NEI award we studied the functional properties of the microcircuits
of mouse primary visual cortex and discovered that groups of coactive neurons, termed
“neuronal ensembles”, account for the majority of cortical responses to visual stimuli and
also dominate spontaneous activity. Further, using two-photon optogenetics, we found
that ensembles can be artificially imprinted into the cortex and they can be recalled by
stimulating individual neurons (pattern completion), even days after imprinting.
Confirming their functional role, activating ensembles with holographic optogenetics led
to predictable changes in visual discrimination in a Go/NoGo behavioral task. These
data, confirmed by others, and the widespread alteration of ensembles in mouse models
of disease, suggest that ensembles are microcircuit building blocks of cortical function.
To better understand ensembles we now propose to characterize their basic
phenomenology and cellular identity, understand their biophysical, synaptic circuit
mechanisms and explore the role of inhibitory interneurons. Our preliminary data support
the hypothesis that ensembles are due to increases in excitability and are sculpted by
inhibition. To test this, we will study primary visual cortex of awake behaving mice and
use a novel two-photon holographic microscopy method to image and optically
manipulate neurons in different cortical layers simultaneously. We will also use in vivo
patch clamping of ensemble cells and novel graph theory models to map the circuit,
identify key cells for manipulation and test their role in ensemble activation/suppression.
 Our work will provide a systematic description of ensembles in primary visual cortex,
how they work, how they regulate the activity of the cortex and how they can be
manipulated and reconfigured. Neuronal ensembles could constitute functional modules
of cortical function. Understanding the link between ensembles and cortical plasticity
could help design novel therapeutic strategies to treat amblyopia or cortical cerebral
visual impairment by reconfiguring pathological circuits."

Summary
Evolutionary conserved DNA repair mechanisms cooperate throughout the cell cycle to faithfully maintain
genome integrity. However, a minimal understanding exists for how damaged chromatin directs the series of
events that dictate ensuing repair mechanism. This gap in knowledge is particularly relevant to a poorly
understood homology directed repair mechanism that becomes active to maintain telomere length in
approximately 15% of human cancers. Alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) occurs by noncanonical
homology directed DNA repair mechanism in cancers of mesenchymal origin. The recombination mechanisms
responsible for telomere maintenance represent a unique vulnerability in ALT reliant cancers.
We have developed experimental systems that enable quantitative, real-time visualization of each step in the
homology directed repair of damaged telomeres. Our published studies reveal that ALT is initiated by DNA
damage dependent homology directed repair synthesis that proceeds unidirectionally to the end of the
chromosome. We named this mechanism Break Induced Telomere Synthesis and showed that it is critical for
telomere lengthening in cells that utilize ALT. Here, we examine the question of how DNA damage responses
assemble on telomeric chromatin to direct long-tract homology directed repair telomere synthesis.
We hypothesize that Break Induced Telomere Synthesis occurs by assembling elements of several different
DNA repair mechanisms on telomeric chromatin to achieve homology directed repair synthesis. Our unpublished
results definitively support this premise, showing extensive PCNA- ubiquitination and recruitment of the 5’-3’
nuclease SNM1A and 5’-3’ helicase FANCJ at damaged telomeres to promote DNA repair synthesis and
telomere integrity. We will investigate the basis for their damage dependent association with telomeres and
functions in recombination dependent repair synthesis at telomeres using a multifaceted approach that allows
us to examine each step of the telomere damage response in cells and in vitro in highly purified systems that
assemble the break induced replisome on defined substrates. These fundamental studies are designed to
understand the critical elements of Break Induced Telomere Synthesis and how it allows telomere lengthening
for sustained proliferation in cells that rely on ALT."

Emotion regulation (ER) impairments in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exacerbate social
difficulties, increase parental stress, and limit functioning. The preschool years mark a significant period in typical
ER development during which parent-child interactions play a critical role. This is also when ASD is typically
diagnosed and intervention begins. The research and training described in this K23 application will build on the
candidate’s existing expertise, adding conceptual and methodological skills needed to study complex, multi-
modal, and dyadic social processes important to ER development. Specifically, this innovative research will
examine dynamics of children’s physiological and behavioral responses to distress and parents’ regulatory
responses to their children as potential early markers of ER impairment in preschool-age children with and
without ASD. Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that children with ASD differ from non-ASD peers in communication of
negative emotion and in the degree to which their physiological arousal predicts observed emotion. Aim 2 takes
a dyadic view of development to examine how individual differences in child emotion communication relate to
parents’ adaptive co-regulatory responses. These aims will be achieved through integration of ambulatory
peripheral physiological measurement and detailed microanalytic coding of child emotion communication (e.g.
clarity, salience, directedness of emotional signals) and parent response. Machine learning techniques will
provide a data-driven approach to integrate multi-modal, dyadic data in examining predictive relationships
between physiology and behavior (Aim 1) and between child communication and parent response (Aim 2). Aim
3 will make use of longitudinal measures of child ER to examine how child emotion communication and parental
responsiveness relate to later ER. The candidate is a clinical psychologist with expertise in microanalytic coding,
bidirectional influences in parent-infant interactions, and early social-communication development in infants at
high risk for ASD. The proposed K23 application will provide the candidate with the training needed to develop
new knowledge and skills in; (1) collection, analysis, and interpretation of physiological data; (2) machine learning
methods for analyzing predictive relations between variables from multiple modalities; and (3)
conceptual/theoretical and methodological issues related to ER development in the preschool years. With these
new expertise, the candidate will be well-positioned to build an innovative program of research focused on
uncovering biobehavioral markers of disrupted social emotional development in children with ASD to act as
specific targets for interventions focused on parent-child interactions. Training will occur within the exceptional
scientific environment in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh and with the support of a
team of extremely well-qualified mentors (Drs. Mazefsky, Goodwin, Akcakaya, and Hipwell) and consultants
(Drs. Morgan and Lunkenheimer) whose complementary expertise is ideally suited to the goals of this K23
proposal and the candidate’s long-term goals."
10792151,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The burden of colorectal, cervical, and breast cancer cases and deaths are disproportionately greater among
individuals living in impoverished and underserved areas. Early detection of these cancers through screenings
and timely treatment among individuals diagnosed with precancers or cancers can reduce inequities in these
vulnerable groups. Actionable data to guide outreach efforts, and implement programs and policies are
urgently needed to reduce colorectal, cervical, and breast disparities among low-income and underserved
communities. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the American Cancer Society (ACS) recently
emphasized the promise of big data in improving knowledge and providing more accurate data for informing
practice and policies. This project draws from the NCI’s and ACS’s vision of the strategic use of big data and
integrates it within an interactive data visualization framework. We will utilize South Carolina state’s Integrated
Database System (covering health information of over 90% of low-income individuals) to determine colorectal,
cervical, and breast cancer disparities among low-income and underserved individuals and develop a user-
centered cancer disparities visualization tool through stakeholder engagement. Two end products (a web-
based interactive tool and a toolkit) will be disseminated to community organizations and stakeholders working
with low-income and underserved populations. Our goal is to provide useful, usable, understandable health
disparities data and form partnerships with community organizations and stakeholders to implement evidence-
based resources and achieve cancer health equity. Therefore, this proposal is directly responsive to PAR-20-
283 (Objective: Providing health information resources/services to community organizations involved with
health disparity population’). We plan to put the information generated from this study into immediate action by
deploying the Medical University of South Carolina’s fully operational mobile health units to provide cancer
screenings to communities and groups with urgent needs. A data-driven approach to population outreach,
combined with the implementation of evidence-based interventions, could translate into long-term public health
and economic gains."
10793858,"ABSTRACT/PROJECT SUMMARY
Psychotic symptoms that occur in advanced age in the absence of an acute medical condition or prominent
mood symptoms can represent the late appearance of primary psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia or
delusional disorder or can presage the appearance of a neurodegenerative condition such as Alzheimer’s
disease (AD). An episode of non-affective psychosis late in life more than doubles the risk of subsequent
neurodegenerative disease, with an average time from psychosis to AD diagnosis of 18 months. The biologic
mechanisms responsible for the increased risk of dementia in those who experience psychosis are unclear.
One hypothesis is reverse causality, in which inchoate neurodegeneration is responsible for psychotic
symptoms that emerge in the absence of traditional cognitive hallmarks of dementia. The psychosis then
heralds the inception of illness that will eventuate in cognitive decline. An increased burden of tau pathology
has been associated with psychosis in AD. In the current pilot study will utilize PI-2620, a novel tau positron
emission tomography (PET) ligand, together with single molecule array (SiMOA) peripheral fluid
immunoassays to investigate whether there is evidence of elevations in tau biomarkers in a cohort of late-onset
psychosis subjects without cognitive impairment. At the completion of this exploratory study, we will know
whether there is evidence of tau pathology from high-sensitivity biomarkers in late-onset psychosis that would
warrant a larger R01 study that would be focused on longitudinal outcomes assessing the influence of tau
biomarker positivity on the risk of conversion to dementia over time."
10800250,"Project Summary
Circadian rhythms are a critical component of behavioral and homeostatic function in nearly every organism on
Earth, including humans. Neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and epilepsy are often
accompanied by disruptions in circadian rhythms. In turn, this can exacerbate neuropathology symptoms and
worsen quality of life by causing insomnia, fragmented sleep, daytime hypersomnia, and perturbation of
metabolism. In fact, the links between metabolism and circadian function are becoming increasingly apparent.
Several components of the core molecular clock are redox sensitive or transcriptionally modified by
metabolites like NADPH, and mitochondria are known to exhibit circadian rhythms. Drosophila are an excellent
model organism in which to study circadian rhythms at behavioral, genetic, and neuronal level, possessing a
vast genetic toolkit and highly standardized methodology for assaying rhythmicity. We recently established that
the stable Drosophila model for mitochondrial diseases such as Maternally Inherited Leigh Syndrome, termed
ATP6[1], exhibits profound arrhythmicity in sleep/wake behavioral patterns and in specific behaviors such as
egg laying and eclosion under constant conditions, making it an excellent model system in which to study the
mechanistic links between altered metabolism and circadian rhythms. Here, we propose to determine the
mechanism by which mitochondrial disease leads to rhythm disruption by probing the molecular clock's
transcription-translation feedback loop, examining the physiology of the circadian circuit at the neuronal level,
and elucidating the consequences of perturbed bioenergetics and redox state. Importantly, we have also
recently discovered a successful treatment for the neurological consequences of mitochondrial disease in the
ketogenic diet, including significant improvement in rhythmicity. Therefore, we propose in Aim 2 to determine
the scope and mechanism by which this dietary therapy improves circadian function by examining
bioenergetics and physiology of neurons and glia, ion channel modulation in circadian neurons, altered gene
expression in the circadian circuit, and effects on the core clock. Additionally, we have found via a preliminary
genetic screen that disruption of glycolysis and of the Krebs Cycle also have a negative impact on circadian
rhythms. For example, RNAi knockdown and classical null alleles of citrate synthase have extremely poor
rhythmicity. We propose in Aim 3 to use the power of the Drosophila genetic toolkit to identify novel modulators
of circadian function in critical metabolic pathways including glycolysis, the Krebs Cycle, ketone body and lipid
metabolism, amino acid and neurotransmitter synthesis, and others. Overall, this project will contribute
significantly to our understanding of the links between metabolism and circadian rhythms in health and
neurological disease, as well as open new therapeutic avenues based on diet and metabolic targets."
10799878,"In 2017, decompensated cirrhosis caused more than 1.32 million deaths globally and 62,943 deaths in the
USA. A transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), an intraparenchymal artificial shunt created
between the hepatic vein (HV) and the portal vein (PV), is the most effective life-saving procedure to stop
acute variceal bleeding (AVB) that cannot be controlled endoscopically. TIPS is also effective to decrease the
risk of recurrence of tense ascites and improve renal dysfunction in patients with chronic liver disease.
However, Intrahepatic puncture for TIPS creation remains one of the most challenging and radiation-intensive
procedure, carrying high risks of various complications in up to 20% of cases even in the hands of experienced
Interventional Radiologists. Intraperitoneal hemorrhage caused by liver and extrahepatic portal vein rupture
is the most catastrophic major complication of TIPS creation. In children, TIPS has been employed to alleviate
symptoms of refractory ascites and variceal bleeding, but only adult TIPS puncture sets are available for kids
with portal hypertension. The intrahepatic puncture devices, complications and technical failure rate have not
changed since TIPS was invented by interventional radiologists (IR). To address the critical issues described
above, we are developing a novel in-plane IVUS/fiber optic imaging-integrated micro puncture balloon
catheter system for TIPS creation. Tests of the fine needle/balloon catheter system in pig cadavers for TIPS
creation resulted in 100% success of placing a 5Fr. catheter in the portal vein from the right hepatic vein. This
novel fine needle(22G)/balloon catheter system is expected to eliminate the risk and significantly lower the
difficulties of TIPS techniques, which will ultimately increase the availability of TIPS treatment. The in-plane
IVUS and/or fiber optic imaging guidance will further facilitate TIPS creation. Therefore, we need to implement
a series of experiments to bridge the gap between our laboratory innovation of a novel system for TIPS
creation and clinical translation for treating patients with portal hypertension. At first, we will optimize the key
components and parameters of the needle/balloon catheter systems using human excised cirrhotic liver
specimens. Secondly, we will develop the technique of using fiber optic imaging and/or in-plane IVUS-
integrated needle/balloon catheter system for TIPS creation in normal adult pigs, optimize the technical
parameters, and further validate the technique of using the system for TIPS in pigs with liver cirrhosis and
portal hypertension. At last, we will develop the technique of using this novel system for TIPS creation in baby
and young pigs, optimize the technical parameters, and further validate the technique of using the system for
TIPS in young pigs with portal hypertension. We are confident that the success of this project will lead to
significant breakthroughs in the procedure of TIPS creation and benefit millions of patients with
decompensated cirrhosis."
10803169,"Developing PARP-1 PET with companion tissue assay as a precision tool to guide PARPi therapy
PROJECT SUMMARY
When we give pharmaceuticals to patients with cancer, they deserve the best predictive measures we can
employ to tell them whether the therapy has a significant likelihood of killing the tumor and extending their life.
No one should have to suffer drug toxicity without benefit. If this proposal is successful, we will develop a
noninvasive predictive biomarker of sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (PARPi) that could potentially be used for real-
time dose modulation as well as patient selection. While our investigations will impact PARPi in any tumor type,
we largely focus on breast cancer where PARPi are currently used in the setting of metastatic disease and the
adjuvant setting. Here, the ability to predict response would also provide a critically needed biomarker to stratify
patients for clinical trials testing neoadjuvant PARPi/chemotherapy combinations, especially in the triple-
negative breast cancer population.
BRCA1/2 and HRD testing indirectly select tumors that may be susceptible to PARPi, leveraging the concept of
synthetic lethality, but do not directly measure drug-target density. The development of imaging-tissue markers
for PARPi binding and PARP-1 expression is innovative in the context that currently used companion diagnostics
for PARPi use genomic assays. Preliminary data in breast and ovarian cancer show that assay of the target
(PARP-1), binding by PARPi, and measures of drug-target engagement provide complementary information that
appears to add predictive value. In this proposal, we will develop a correlative tissue assay to a promising PARP-
1 radiotracer, using imaging, immunohistochemistry, and in vitro radioligand binding assay (Aim 1), test the assay
for predictive value in historical clinical trial sets from patients who received PARPi with known clinical outcomes
(Aim 2), and directly evaluate the hypothesis that tracer uptake predicts response in animal models of disease
(Aim 3). The validated imaging agent and tissue companion diagnostic would have planned clinical use similar
to fluoroestradiol imaging/estrogen receptor assessment. Clinicians could avoid futile therapy in cases where
the target is not expressed and also potentially identify additional patients who would benefit from PARP-1
targeted therapy and combination strategies.
Precision medicine is within our reach and needs to be employed for aggressive breast cancers. If successful,
this research could lead to a new way to functionally characterize breast cancer, guide targeted therapy selection,
and assess therapeutic response and resistance. The new imaging probe is immediately applicable to patients
at our center and production has been standardized to facilitate multi-center use."

 Children’s reading and math skills are critical to their future educational outcomes, career readiness, and
overall health and well-being (e.g., ACT, 2020; Cain & Oakhill, 2006; DeWalt et al., 2004; Geary, 2011;
Heilmann, 2020; Krajewski & Schneider, 2009; Ritchie & Bates, 2013), yet many children struggle with math
and learning to read (National Center for Education Statistics, 2020). Individuals who struggle with math or
learning to read often display weaknesses in executive function (EF) skills on behavioral measures (Peng &
Fuchs, 2014), which could underline one of the fundamental bases of their deficits in reading and math.
Conversely, individuals who struggle with reading or math may need to recruit additional EF skills to
compensate for their poor reading and math problem-solving to meet task demands (Martinez-Lincoln et al., in
review). By understanding the association between EF and domain-specific academic skills, we will have
greater insight into the development of reading and math, and how EF can hinder or facilitate academic
growth. This proposal aims to examine the recruitment of domain-general vs. domain-specific EF (Aim 1) and
the connectivity for domain-specific and EF brain regions (Aim 2) in 7-8 yo children. After EF recruitment and
connectivity have been established, behavioral correlates that influence EF connectivity to domain-specific
regions will be examined in a larger group of children, over-sampled for reading and math difficulty (Aim 3), to
facilitate a greater understanding of the underlying cognitive mechanisms of learning and how EF may vary by
reading and math skill level.
 This proposal integrates behavioral and neuroimaging approaches, to fulfill the candidate’s short-term
goals to distinguish the recruitment and connectivity of EF in reading and math for children and the behavioral
correlates that influence EF brain activity and connectivity to understand development. These findings will
support her long-term goals to use these complementary methodologies to develop effective interventions for
struggling learners and to identify how the recruitment of EF may differ across development. The proposed
training plan will provide skills necessary to have a successful, independent research career in academia by
enhancing the candidate’s research program, while also expanding her research skills in four key areas: (1) a
greater understanding of the underlying cognitive mechanisms of reading and math, (2) advanced
computational and statistical approaches to neuroimaging data, (3) scholarly productivity in educational
neuroscience, and (4) professional development. The candidate’s career and training plan will take place at
Vanderbilt’s University (VU), a consistent recipient of funding from the National Institutes of Health. VU has a
top-ranking Special Education Program with one of the few educational neuroscience programs and has
substantial resources to provide support to the candidate during the K99 phase of the award."
10810507,"Recent studies support the hypothesis that the host plays an active role in maintaining homeostatic symbiosis
with the gut microbiota. However, the host-specific mechanisms employed to sculpt the microbiota remain to
be fully elucidated, in part, due to shortcomings of current in vivo models. Data from our group and others
support that -defensins, abundant antimicrobial effector molecules of small-intestinal Paneth cells, help shape
the composition of the gut microbiota. Perturbations in Paneth cell function contribute to pathogenesis of
disease by disturbing the homeostatic balance of the microbiota (dysbiosis). Yet, little is known regarding the
role of Paneth cell effectors (e.g., -defensins) in mediating changes in the gut microbiota during dynamic
physiological (non-disease) processes. This proposal aims to develop two innovative mouse models valuable
for delineating host mechanisms that shape gut microbiota during processes intrinsic to mammalian biology.
During lactation, arguably one of the most strenuous physiological processes for mammals, intestinal biology
must adapt to the demands of reproductive biology. Our preliminary data demonstrate that in lactating dams,
rapid and dramatic changes in the small intestine at both the gross and molecular levels accompany a major
restructuring of gut-associated microbial communities. Concomitantly, during lactation a striking and
unsynchronized change in the expression of individual Paneth cell -defensins is observed at a scale far
greater than previously observed in other experimental settings, including enteric infection and inflammation.
We will address the hypothesis that during lactation, a period of extraordinary energy demand, a dramatic
alteration in α-defensin production drives changes in the microbiota that serve to benefit the dam (effective
energy harvest from foodstuffs). A corollary hypothesis that changes in the microbiota of the lactating dam
benefit the offspring (e.g., facilitation of vertical microbiota transmission) will be addressed in the future using
the model developed herein. Aim #1 will develop the lactating dam as a novel model to interrogate dynamic
and physiological host-microbiota interactions in mammals. Factors impacting dynamics of the host-microbe
interface will be systematically delineated to create a robust and reproducible model for study. Aim #2 will
develop a novel Paneth cell -defensin knockout mouse to explore the necessity of -defensins in driving
microbiota changes during lactation; this knockout model will also be invaluable to the field for other studies of
intestinal innate immunity. The paradigm of pronounced maternal intestinal remodeling during lactation and its
potential long-term influence on both maternal and offspring health has been largely unexplored. The
dynamically adapting intestine of the lactating dam may represent an ecosystem of host-microbe interactions
fundamental to mammalian life. Successful completion of these Aims will establish valuable models to better
understand host-mediated mechanisms to shape the gut microbiota, contributing insights on intestinal innate
mucosal immunity, as well as providing foundations for application to other disciplines."

Hypertension (HTN) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States and affects approximately
45% of US adults. Blood pressure (BP) is almost invariably higher during the day; however, the relative drop in
overnight BP is a better predictor of overall CV risk than daytime BP. Generally, patients with HTN are classified
into: (1) dipping, where the average nighttime BP drops by ≥10% from the daytime average; and (2) non-dipping,
where the average nighttime BP does not dip by 10%. More than 30% of patients with HTN have a non-dipping
BP profile, which is associated with a significantly increased risk for adverse outcomes, including end-organ
damage, and mortality, compared to patients with dipping HTN. It is unclear what causes non-dipping HTN, but
the circadian system and sleep likely play a role because both systems affect the day-night variation in BP. Our
goal is to determine, in patients with untreated HTN, the separate contributions of the internal circadian system
and sleep to the non-dipping BP profile and the day/night variability in associated CV variables, including
estimates of sympathetic and parasympathetic activity, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activity, and
vascular endothelial function.
Our specific aims are to determine: 1) if circadian rhythms in BP are altered in non-dipping HTN and 2) the role
of sleep in non-dipping HTN. We hypothesize that: 1) BP circadian rhythms are altered in non-dipping compared
to dipping HTN, resulting in a reduced nocturnal BP decline; 2) sleep duration is shorter in non-dipping than
dipping HTN, and 3) the absence of sleep attenuates overnight BP drop in dipping HTN more than non-dipping
HTN. An exploratory aim is to determine if two weeks of sleep regularization increases overnight BP dipping.
Thirty-two participants (16 dippers, 16 non-dippers, 16 females, and 16 males) will partake in all studies. We will
first quantify sleep duration using unattended polysomnography in participants’ homes. Second, we will uncover
circadian rhythms in BP by employing a 40-h constant routine protocol, where all participants will be monitored
in the laboratory during uninterrupted rested wakefulness in a semi-recumbent posture, dim light, and without
time cues. Third, we will conduct a randomized crossover trial in dim light in the laboratory, during which overnight
sleep is permitted or not. BP and mechanistic CV markers are continuously measured in the circadian study and
the crossover trial. In the crossover trial, we will also measure sympathetic activity using microneurography and
24-h BP on the days of the trials. Finally, we will pilot test a two-week sleep regularization schedule, including
maintaining a self-selected bedtime, to its impact on overnight BP dipping.
These highly controlled experiments will enable us to document the separate roles of the circadian system and
sleep in non-dipping HTN. Understanding underlying CV mechanisms will provide potential pharmacological
targets for evidence-based chronotherapy in HTN. Understanding the role of sleep will provide future
opportunities to formally test sleep extension or regularization as behavioral therapies for non-dipping HTN."
10815724,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT: Changing clinician practice is difficult but important. Traditionally,
strategies to attain sustainable practice change have followed one of two general paths: financial incentives
and practice redesign and implementation. Financial incentives, while often effective in aggregate, tend to have
heterogeneous effects across individuals and systems. Practice design and implementation, while allowing for
highly tailored local solutions, is resource intensive and thus difficult to scale across settings and populations.
We hypothesize that the two strategies can be deployed together, augmenting their respective strengths and
mitigating their weaknesses. The Principal Investigator, in her ongoing K08-award, identified preoperative
patient optimization as an ideal case study for new models effecting clinician practice change. Adherence to
best practices that manage obesity, smoking, and diabetes preoperatively can reduce surgical complications
by up to 40%. Despite the compelling clinical case, surgeon adherence to preoperative patient optimization
remains surprisingly low. Her work highlighted the most important barriers to surgeon adherence. First,
surgeons have little financial incentive to delay surgery, suggesting the potential for financial incentives to
quickly align surgeon practices with patient preoperative optimization. Second, barriers related to resources for
patient optimization, organizational culture, and established practice patterns were identified; highlighting the
need for additional behavior change strategies such as a clinician facing educational and behavior change
intervention PREoperative Program (PREP) and onsite facilitation to overcome organizational and practice
barriers. This proposal builds on these K08 findings to deploy and test a novel combination of: 1) a policy
creating a financial incentive (policy evaluation) with 2) implementation science strategies (by adding these
resources to policy non-responders) to create an effective and scalable program to improve practice. The
project will leverage the Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborative (MSQC), a well-established, statewide registry
and improvement consortium involving 70 hospitals in Michigan. We will take advantage of a unique
opportunity to conduct a natural experiment of a recently launched pay-for-performance (P4P) program (Aim 1)
combined with a non-responder Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) trial (Aims 2 and
3) to test the effectiveness of PREP and an onsite facilitator on augmenting site underperformance or non-
response to the P4P incentive. The SMART design allows for testing a strategy of applying higher resource
intervention only when the change was not facilitated with a lower resource intervention, explicitly recognizing
the trade-off between resource intensity and scalability. The proposed study will have immediate and
significant impact by developing and validating optimal strategies for improving adherence to patient
optimization across a statewide health system. More broadly, the project will inform novel adaptive
implementation strategies that could be scaled to other important practice gaps."

The development of therapeutic drugs to cure obesity has not been successful due to unwanted side effects
and limited efficacy. My long term research goal is to delineate neural pathways responsible for body weight
homeostasis, and provide a framework for effective and specific therapeutics against obesity. Despite exciting
progress has been made in understanding feeding behavior regulated by melanocortin receptors 4 (Mc4Rs)
and paraventricular hypothalamus, downstream neurons that mediate their action on feeding are not clear.
Our preliminary data showed that PVH neurons sent abundant projections to the ventral part of lateral septum
(LSv), where a subset of leptin receptor (LepR)-expressing neurons are located. In vivo optogenetic stimulation
of channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2)-expressing PVH→LSv fibers potently inhibited feeding, suggesting a previously
unappreciated role for LSv neurons in mediating the PVH action on feeding. Importantly, LSv local
administration of glutamate receptor antagonists increased feeding, suggesting an ongoing tonic glutamatergic
action in LSV on feeding inhibition. Based on our strong preliminary data and the established role for PVH
Mc4R neurons in feeding, we hypothesize that monosynaptic PVH Mc4R→LSv glutamatergic projections
regulate feeding through controlling LSv LepR neuron activity. Aim 1 will test the effects on inhibiting PVH
Mc4R-LSv firers on anxiety and anxiety related hypophagia. Aim 2 will determine the role of Mc4Rs and
glutamate release from LSv-projecting PVH neurons in body weight regulation. Aim 3 will determine whether
the role of PVH direct downstream neurons the LSv in body weight regulation.
This proposal utilizes a combination of optogenetics and mouse genetics to reveal a previously unknown
PVH→LSV neural pathway in feeding regulation and will establish LepR neurons in LSV as a novel direct
downstream target of PVH for feeding regulation. This novel circuit will potentially bridge hypothalamic feeding
regulation with functions associated with limbic LSV regions such as stress and anxiety, representing a
significant step in understanding the complex feeding behavior with more relevance to human obesity
associated with anxiety-related overeating."

Despite robust effects on depression and anxiety, access to mindfulness-based interventions is limited. The delivery of mindfulness training via mobile health is a promising approach for increasing access to optimized mindfulness interventions. However, for this work to move forward, it is vital to determine the necessary dose of mindfulness practice. The proposed project will begin to address this knowledge gap by evaluating an existing mobile health mindfulness intervention within a depressed/anxious sample and characterizing the association between dosage and outcomes. This Career Development Award will provide the candidate training in mobile health clinical trials and evaluation of intervention effects through ecological momentary assessment and intensive longitudinal data analysis. This new training will be leveraged to test the dosage-outcome relationship within a mobile health context. A sample of 90 individuals with elevated symptoms of depression and/or anxiety will be recruited from the community and provided with a smartphone-based mindfulness intervention providing instruction in practices central to established mindfulness-based therapies (e.g., mindfulness-based cognitive therapy). Participants will be randomly assigned to two dosages of mindfulness practice and followed for 4- weeks. Depression and anxiety symptoms and purported mechanisms (decentering, repetitive negative thinking, mindfulness) will be measured via ecological momentary assessments. Aim 1 will assess the feasibility, acceptability, and trends in changes in outcomes for the 4-week mobile health intervention using symptom measures and metrics drawn from implementation science. Aim 2 will establish the effect of experimental manipulation on mindfulness practice dosage. The ability to manipulate dosage is important for future studies seeking to determine an optimal dose of mindfulness practice. Aim 3 will characterize the association between practice dosage with symptoms and candidate mechanisms using pre-post and intensive longitudinal ecological momentary assessment data. Dynamic structural equation models will evaluate bidirectional cross-lagged relationships between dosage with symptoms and mechanisms. These models will clarify the dosage-outcome relationship and will provide estimates of effect size and heterogeneity for planning a future large-scale randomized controlled trial. All aims will be supported by didactic, experiential, and mentored training in the fundamentals of clinical research through the NIH-funded Institute for Clinical and Translational Research (ICTR) and the Center for Healthy Minds. Aim 3 will be facilitated by new training in advanced longitudinal data collection and analysis, supported by a training team with extensive expertise in these domains. Collectively, the research and training aims of this project seek to promote the development of acceptable and effective mindfulness-based mobile health interventions for depression and anxiety, providing new training in mobile health clinical trials and advanced quantitative methods. This award will enable the candidate to conduct future intervention studies aimed at reducing the burden of depression and anxiety through optimized mobile health technology."
10820498,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a national health epidemic impacting 30 million Americans, with a
disproportionate representation in racial and ethnic minority populations. In its most advanced forms, CKD is
associated with poor quality of life, overwhelming symptom burden, and a high mortality. Palliative, or
supportive care, is a specialty that has expertise in symptom management, assistance in medical decision-
making, and end-of-life care. In kidney disease, supportive care often is not integrated in the standard of care,
partly due to lack of evidence and failure to identify an optimal model for its delivery. This proposal, “Supportive
care in CKD: Scope of practice and pilot implementation” seeks to learn more about the integration of
supportive care in current nephrology practice and test the effectiveness of implementing an integrated care
model in advanced CKD, while I learn essential training skills to become an independent researcher.
Specifically, this is a three-aim study for a mentored career development award that 1) Describes the current
scope of integration of supportive care in the care of non-dialysis CKD patients and its association with patient
reported outcomes through analysis of a nationally representative database; 2) Tests the effectiveness of
integrating supportive care with usual nephrology care in CKD stage IV or V patients using a pilot randomized,
controlled trial conducted in an urban safety net hospital; and 3) Determines the mechanism of effectiveness or
unmet needs of the supportive care intervention through application of qualitative and mixed-methods
methodology. These three aims will be achieved while completing complementary training aims in comparative
effectiveness research with specific training in quantitative data base analysis, clinical trial execution,
qualitative, and mixed methods methodology.
The results of this proposal will provide essential information to the nephrology community about dissemination
of supportive care in the care of non-dialysis CKD care, a population with urgent supportive care needs.
Furthermore, this analysis will identify disparities in supportive care access in CKD and critical associations
between lack of supportive care access and patient reported outcomes. The second phase of this study will
move the field of nephrology forward by testing the effectiveness of implementation of supportive care in
advanced CKD in a multi-ethnic population representative of the demographics of CKD. The data obtained
from these three aims will provide essential data regarding supportive care resources in the community, the
potential impact of increasing access to kidney supportive care, the feasibility of implementing new models of
supportive care in this population, and the statistical information necessary for the design of larger multi-
centered trials. These aims will be accomplished while developing my skills as an independent researcher and
positioning me to apply these results in definitive trials with the potential to broadly improve the care of the
many Americans suffering from CKD."
10820507,"Summary
Aging represents a major risk factor for a broad range of diseases and declines in tissue homeostasis
and function. This is particularly true in the female reproductive system where the aging of stored
oocytes has been directly linked with an increased incidence of miscarriages and birth defects. Our
long-term goal is to identify and characterize the factors that contribute to reproductive aging. In
mammals, eggs can be stored months, years, or decades, making the analysis of reproductive aging
slow and experimentally difficult. Here, we seek to build upon previous efforts to establish the Drosophila
ovary as a powerful system with which to study reproductive aging. Interestingly, the decline in egg
quality has been correlated with lower levels of mRNA translation across species, from flies to humans.
Despite this common defect, we know surprisingly little about the mechanisms responsible for this
reduction of mRNA translation capacity within stored eggs. Here, we propose to use state of the art
genetic manipulation and biochemical analysis to systematically characterize how the machinery
required for mRNA translation changes with maternal age and during egg storage in Drosophila.
Moreover, we seek to genetically test whether manipulating ribosome levels and translation
initiation/elongation rates prolongs the quality of stored eggs. We have established an operational
pipeline for conducting all the experiments outlined under this proposal and seek to take advantage of
a number of innovative tools and techniques that have been adopted by our group. Under Aim 1, we
will use complementary molecular and biochemical approaches to comprehensively characterize the
extent to which protein synthesis and ribosome levels changes in the ovaries of aging females and in
eggs stored over two weeks. We will also use biochemical and innovative reporter based assays to
evaluate whether translation fidelity declines with age. In aim 2, we will test the extent to which
increasing or decreasing ribosome levels and translation initiation and elongation rates improves the
quality of stored eggs. Under aim 3, we will characterize how the ribosome oxygenase NO66 influences
egg quality. We believe this comprehensive analysis of in vivo oocytes during the course of aging will
provide key insights into why the quality of eggs declines with age and will reveal new molecular targets
for the development of therapies designed to improve and extend reproduction. Given our focus on the
role ribosomes play in this process, we believe our work will broadly impact the study of tissue
homeostasis and regeneration in aging organisms."
10821452,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Depression and anxiety are highly comorbid and costly diseases. Evidence-based psychotherapy is the first-line
treatment but is underutilized and not scalable. Digital mental health interventions (DMHIs), delivered via the
internet and/or mobile apps, have evolved as efficacious and potentially scalable treatments. To date, however,
effectiveness in routine care is limited by insufficient patient engagement. In order to achieve the transformative
potential of DMHIs, we must identify strategies to keep patients engaged without adding human support in a
form that would limit scalability. Automated motivational push messaging (AMM) and light-touch human coach
support (CS) offer two such strategies. The proposed research tests these strategies, while drawing preliminary
conclusions about a hypothesized model of DMHI engagement based on the technology adoption and treatment
adherence literature. The model posits that two systems-level constructs (social influence and facilitating
conditions) and three patient-level constructs (attitude, self-efficacy, habit strength) drive DMHI engagement. In
Study 1 (N=20), I will employ user-centered design to develop and refine a set AMMs targeting the three
hypothesized patient-level engagement-driving constructs (Aim 1). In Study 2, I will recruit N=76 primary care
patients with depression and/or anxiety via provider referral to an 8-week 2x2 factorial clinical trial whereby
participants will all receive access to a DMHI with known efficacy and be randomized to an engagement strategy
condition (i.e., a previously-validated CS protocol, newly-developed AMM, both or neither). To further understand
how AMMs function, message delivery in the AMM arms will be micro-randomized: each day participants will be
randomized to receive a message or not, such that they receive an average of 4.2 messages/week. Micro-
randomization allows causal inference about the near-term impact of message delivery (i.e., are AMMs a cue to
action) and the relationship between message impact and context (e.g., time of day the message is delivered).
Measured outcome data will comprise level of engagement (operationalized as minutes of DMHI use), weekly
self-reports on the five engagement-driving constructs, and weekly self-reports of clinical outcomes. I will test
im pacts of each strategy on m easured outcom e data (Aim 2) and explore the hypothesized relationships between
engagement-driving constructs and DMHI engagement (Aim 3). Clinical outcomes will be assessed, however,
consistent with the experimental therapeutics model, this research leverages a DMHI with known efficacy,
allowing the focus to be an upstream target (patient engagement) rather than the clinical outcomes themselves.
The overarching goal is to influence the target so as to ultimately enhance clinical effectiveness. This project will
build my expertise in clinical trial design and build my proficiency in user-centered design (i.e., rapid, prototype
testing via field studies) and data science (i.e., analysis of intensive, correlated longitudinal data) methods
commonly applied in DMHI optimization research. Findings will lay a foundation for R01s aimed at optimizing
DMHIs for engagement, and ultimately effectiveness, when integrated into routine care."

The goal of my research program is to understand how multifunctional protein complexes regulate gene
expression, especially during stress responses. Our current focus is the yeast Ccr4-Not complex, which has
been implicated in virtually all aspects of gene control, including transcription, mRNA decay, translational
repression and protein ubiquitylation. The complex is it is highly conserved in all eukaryotes. Our laboratory
has been a leader in understanding its role in transcription, especially RNA polymerase II elongation,
employing multifaceted approaches including genetics, molecular biology, reconstitution biochemistry and
genomics. Characterizing Ccr4-Not requires a flexible strategy and a willingness to move in new directions.
This proposal will tackle two disparate processes under its control, namely the role of its ubiquitylation activity
in gene expression and the mechanism of the reprogramming of Ccr4-Not mRNA targets during stress
responses as a means to balance mRNA synthesis and decay.
 Protein destruction during transcription and DNA damage responses is an essential process. The Not4
subunit of the complex contains an E3 RING domain and controls ubiquitin-dependent destruction of proteins.
We have shown that Ccr4-Not associates with elongation complexes and, recently, that it regulates the
destruction of RNAPII after DNA damage. Theme 1 will identify novel targets of Not4 using global proteomics,
identify the sites of modification and use molecular genetics and biochemistry to determine the consequences
of ubquitylation on the protein’s function. Identifying and characterizing the consequences of Not4 modification
of gene regulatory proteins will not only reveal novel functions of the complex, but lead to a greater
understanding of the importance of protein ubiquitylation in transcription and DNA repair.
 Gene expression buffering is a novel conserved phenomenon where reciprocal changes in the rates in
mRNA synthesis and degradation occur in response to stimuli to maintain similar levels of mRNAs to “balance”
the response. Ccr4-Not has been implicated in this process because it controls both the synthesis and
destruction of mRNAs. The molecular underpinnings of buffering are unknown and the mechanism behind it is
under intense debate. We have mapped the mRNAs associated with Ccr4-Not under resting and oxidative
stress conditions, which revealed extensive redistribution of Ccr4 from constitutive mRNAs to those induced by
oxidative stress, which is likely a key component of buffering. Theme 2 will reveal what accounts for the
reprogramming of the decay machinery during stress by identifying the cis- and trans- factors that control this
response, explore the interplay between the two cellular deadenylases and identify changes in protein
composition and localization of mRNAs undergoing buffering during stress. These studies will identify the
determinants of mRNA targeting during stress responses and undercover the molecular mechanism behind
gene expression buffering."

Cancer patients in rural areas have more limited access to specialized care, are less likely to receive certain
treatments, and have poorer outcomes than their counterparts in non-rural areas. Over recent years, many
rural hospitals have closed and a high proportion of remaining rural hospitals are in financial distress and at
risk for closure, exacerbating barriers to care for rural patients. At the same time, evidence that the volume of
surgeries performed in a hospital is associated with improved health outcomes, including mortality, has led to
efforts to regionalize surgical care. Although the advantages of regionalization are well documented, referring
cancer surgeries to high-volume centers presents challenges for patients, surgeons, and hospitals in rural
communities. Against this complex backdrop, the state of Pennsylvania has initiated the Pennsylvania Rural
Health Model (PRHM), an innovative program designed to provide hospitals with predictable revenue streams
through global budgets and encourage participating hospitals to redesign care delivery to best meet the needs
of their communities. This project will assess the impact of the PRHM on access to and outcomes associated
with cancer surgery. First, we will examine the impact of the PRHM on regional cancer surgery delivery
patterns by examining the location and characteristics of hospitals at which cancer patients receive surgery
using statewide hospital discharge data. By decoupling payment from volume, PRHM changes the incentives
for providers to perform surgeries locally versus referring patients to regional centers. We hypothesize that
patients in areas served by PRHM hospitals will be more likely to be referred to high-volume centers than
those in other rural hospital markets. Second, we will assess the effect of the PRHM on cancer surgery access
and outcomes using linked discharge and cancer registry data. The PRHM emphasizes changes in care
delivery that target improvements in population health, with a focus on access to specialty care. We
hypothesize that surgical cancer patients in areas served by PRHM hospitals may experience improvements in
receipt of recommended cancer surgery, time to surgery, and related health outcomes, including mortality and
readmissions. Third, we will use qualitative methods to understand the PA Rural Health Model implementation
process, including its impacts on resource utilization, hospital capabilities, staffing, care delivery, and financial
incentives for providers. We will conduct interviews with key informants and focus groups with community
stakeholders. Guided by a comprehensive conceptual model derived from implementation science, we will
granularly assess the mechanisms by which PRHM succeeded or failed to affect hospital processes and
outcomes for surgical cancer care. As the population in areas served by targeted hospitals continues to age,
cancer incidence and the demand for high-quality surgical care will increase. Lessons from this context will be
highly relevant for informing alternative payment models in rural hospitals and addressing the needs of surgical
cancer patients in rural communities throughout the United States."

Men who have sex with men (MSM), especially young Black and Latino MSM, have the highest rates of HIV
diagnoses in the United States (US), illustrating the need for efficacious HIV prevention tools for these
populations. In response to the burgeoning HIV epidemic in young MSM (YMSM), our study team adapted the
theory-driven, group-level, evidence-based MyPEEPS intervention for diverse YMSM (R34MH079707; PI:
Garofalo) into an mHealth intervention, MyPEEPS Mobile, to overcome challenges of an in-person group
intervention. MyPEEPS Mobile is a sexual health intervention delivered through peer avatars whose personal
backgrounds and sexual risk scenarios are composites derived from formative research among YMSM, which
identified personal, family-based, and relational challenges influencing sexual health. The MyPEEPS Mobile
Trial data have shown evidence of efficacy, feasibility, acceptability, and high satisfaction by participants 13-18
years of age. Despite very promising results, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) initiation to date over the course
of the study has been extremely low in our sample (3%), which we partially attribute to a dearth of information
on PrEP content in MyPEEPS Mobile and the very young age (13-18 years) of our study participants, for whom
PrEP was not approved at the time of data collection. In response, our study team proposes to expand
MyPEEPS Mobile to develop MyPEEPS Mobile Plus, a multi-level intervention comprised of MyPEEPS
Mobile with added PrEP content (based upon expert advisory and youth feedback) + PrEP E-Peer Navigation
to overcome the challenges of PrEP initiation, adherence, and persistence among YMSM. Peer navigation is
an evidence-based, widely recommended intervention for reaching youth and MSM for HIV-related care
outcomes, with evidence of acceptability among racial/ethnic minority YMSM for PrEP. Peer navigation
addresses common reasons for failing to begin or maintain PrEP use, including low perceived risk, structural or
logistic barriers to care engagement, and anticipated side effects. Relative to in-person and group-based HIV
prevention programs, behavioral interventions with digital and virtual components can have vast reach and
present unique potential to rapidly scale delivery to very large and hidden groups. Therefore, we propose to
conduct a randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of MyPEEPS Mobile Plus (a multi-level intervention
comprised of MyPEEPS Mobile + PrEP E-Peer Navigation) for promoting initiation, adherence, and
persistence of PrEP and decreased HIV risk behavior in YMSM. Building upon our team’s demonstrated ability
to enroll large numbers of young racially and ethnically diverse YMSM and extensive experience developing
mobile health interventions, the proposed study will test the efficacy of this expanded, multi-level mobile HIV
prevention intervention emphasizing PrEP. If efficacious, it will increase PrEP initiation, adherence, and
persistence and decrease overall HIV risk in diverse YMSM in the US."

This project seeks to contribute new insights into the role of heme metabolism in the pathogenesis of
anthracycline cardiac toxicity by leveraging studies in human patients and mouse models. The project will be
led by Aarti Asnani, MD, Cardiologist and Director of Cardio-Oncology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical
Center (BIDMC) and Assistant Professor at Harvard Medical School (HMS). Dr. Asnani will collaborate with a
multidisciplinary team that will provide expertise in heme and cancer biology. Anthracyclines such as
doxorubicin (Dox) are very effective chemotherapies, but their use is limited by cardiac toxicity. Current risk
stratification and cardioprotective strategies are inadequate in patients treated with anthracyclines, largely
because they do not reflect the underlying molecular mechanisms of toxicity. To address this unmet need, we
used aptamer-based proteomics to measure over 1,300 plasma proteins in a discovery cohort of women
treated with anthracyclines for breast cancer. In addition to changes in proteins previously associated with
anthracycline cardiomyopathy, we identified hemopexin (HPX) as a new biomarker of cardiac toxicity, findings
that were validated in a second patient cohort using an ELISA-based assay. HPX is a 57-kDa circulating
glycoprotein synthesized in the liver that has a high binding affinity for the iron-containing molecule heme,
which is pro-oxidant and inflammatory. Upon binding to heme, HPX undergoes receptor-mediated endocytosis
via LRP-1, which is expressed by circulating macrophages and enables heme recycling in the splenic
reticuloendothelial system. This heme detoxification pathway is largely mediated by intracellular heme
oxygenase-1. Intracellular iron overload and macrophage-mediated inflammation have been described as key
molecular mechanisms of Dox cardiac toxicity, underscoring the biological plausibility of HPX as a biomarker in
this setting. Motivated by these human findings, we used a mouse model of chronic doxorubicin
cardiomyopathy to assess the mechanistic implications of HPX induction in anthracycline cardiac toxicity.
Based on our preliminary findings, we hypothesize that HPX is not only a biomarker of cardiac toxicity, but also
a cardioprotective pathway that is activated in response to anthracyclines. We will address this hypothesis in
the following aims: (1) To characterize the effects of HPX gain and loss-of-function on cardiac phenotypes in a
mouse model of chronic Dox cardiomyopathy; (2) To define the role of HPX in Dox cardiac toxicity through
integrative analyses of HPX kinetics and biodistribution, heme/iron metabolism, and chemical and genetic HO-
1 modulation; and (3) To assess the generalizability of blood heme, HPX, and other mechanistic biomarkers of
cardiac toxicity in diverse patient populations treated with anthracyclines. In addition to establishing HPX as a
biomarker of anthracycline cardiac toxicity, this line of investigation will clarify the role of heme metabolism in
cardiovascular disease more broadly. Modulation of HPX and associated pathways could ultimately represent
a new therapeutic strategy to protect the heart during chemotherapy."

 Cancer therapy-induced ovarian insufficiency is a major public health problem affecting millions of women
over their reproductive life span. Our overarching aim is to understand and prevent the damage caused by
cancer treatments and to extend that knowledge to prevent ovarian aging. In the prior period, we successfully
achieved all specific aims and showed: i) Breast cancer chemotherapy but not tamoxifen alone induces a
significant decline of ovarian reserve; ii) Women with BRCA mutations have fewer primordial follicles in their
ovaries, which accumulate more DNA damage with age compared to controls, and, iii) they experience greater
ovarian reserve loss after chemotherapy; iv) Selective knock-down of BRCA1 renders oocytes more liable to
chemotherapy-induced death; v) Gonadotoxic chemotherapy causes primordial follicle death by inducing DNA
double strand breaks (DSBs), which prompts apoptotic follicle death in primordial follicles but not by activation
of their growth in the acute phase. In addition, vi) A ceramide-induced death pathway inhibitor Sphingosine-1-
Phosphate (S1P) prevents chemotherapy-induced human ovarian follicle death, likely by enhancing the ATM-
Pathway. Given the shared mechanisms through DNA damage and repair, these findings opened new avenues
in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced damage to gonadal function, and, to reverse, retard or prevent
reproductive aging. In the current renewal, we aim to further these studies with the following translational aims:
1. To determine whether the mutations in BRCA1 vs. BRCA2 or other key members of the ATM-mediated DNA
DSB Repair Pathway result in the increased susceptibility to chemotherapy-induced ovarian reserve loss and
oocyte death in women with breast cancer; 2. To determine differences in the molecular mechanisms of acute
and delayed chemotherapy-induced human primordial follicle loss; 3. To test the efficacy and mechanism of an
FDA-approved S1P analogue, FTY-720, in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced human ovarian reserve
loss. To achieve these translational aims we will combine clinical studies with studies of basic, translational
mechanisms using in vivo human ovarian xenograft models, laser-captured individual-oocyte RNA sequencing
and single-cell quantitative real-time PCR approaches which evolved in our laboratory during the past funding
periods. These translational studies with human material will be mechanistically strengthened with an in vitro
mouse oocyte gene-interference and genotoxicity assay (GTA), which we also developed and validated in the
past funding periods. This translational proposal will not only expand knowledge of the mechanisms and
prevention of chemotherapy- induced ovarian damage but also result in a paradigm shift in our understanding
of how ovarian germ cells mitigate genotoxic stress in general. The exploitation of such mechanisms, in addition
to leading to new fertility preservation strategies, will provide new insights into future discoveries to moderate
reproductive, and potentially, somatic aging."

Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), a cause of life-threatening complication in cancer patients following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation, causes reconstitution of donor plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) to fail, as pDCs are critical for immune protection and tolerance. However, little is known about GVHD-associated pDC molecular defects and the precise effect of donor pDCs on GVHD in cancer. We used both murine and human systems to uncover the mechanisms by which GVHD induces donor pDC defects. GVHD depleted donor multipotent progenitors (MPPs) that sustain pDCs, leading to impaired pDC generation. MPP loss was associated with decreased numbers of MPP-producing hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and oxidative stress-induced death of remaining proliferating MPPs; this correlates with the common clinical observation of low blood counts in the setting of GVHD. In our models, alloreactive T cells produce GM-CSF to inhibit MPP expression of Tcf4, the transcription factor essential for pDC development, subverting MPP production of pDCs. GM-CSF did not affect the maturation of pDC precursors. Notably, enhanced recovery of donor pDCs upon adoptive transfer early after allogeneic HSC transplantation (allo-HSCT) repressed GVHD and restored de novo generation of donor pDCs in recipient mice. pDCs suppress the proliferation and expansion of activated T cells via a type-I IFN signaling-dependent mechanism. They also produce PD-L1 and LILRB4 to inhibit T cell production of IFN-. Thus, MPPs represent an effective target to bolster pDC reconstitution for GVHD prevention. In spite of these promising preliminary findings, the mechanisms by which MPPs produce pDCs and GVHD impairs MPPs after allo-HSCT in cancer patients as well as patients undergoing allo-HSCT for other diseases remain unknown.
Our continuing studies suggested that Dot1l, which catalyzes H3K79 methylation, is crucial for pDC development. Dot1l appears to be critical for HSC and MPP differentiation into pDCs, PD-L1- and LILRB4-expressing pDCs (termed P/L+ pDCs) in particular. GVHD decreases Dot1l function in MPPs. Thus, impaired Dot1l activity may be the major contributor to pDC defects during GVHD. Successful harnessing of pDCs for GVHD prevention will rely on an understanding of how Dot1l regulates MPP generation, maintenance and pDC formation. We hypothesize that Dot1l promotes the generation and maintenance of MPPs and regulates pDC specification of MPPs. Alloreactive T cell responses can inhibit this Dot1l effect, inducing pDC defects and causing feed-forward GVHD exacerbation. Aim-1 will define the role of Dot1l in pDC reconstitution and the impact of GVHD on Dot1l action in HSPCs. Aim-2 will determine the molecular mechanisms through which pDCs repress alloreactive T cell responses. Aim-3 focuses on the impact of human pDCs on alloreactive T cell responses and assesses whether donor P/L+ pDCs in the allografts can be utilized to predict GVHD in cancer patients. Our proposal explores a heretofore unrecognized role of Dot1l in controlling pDC production and function. If successful, our work will open up new avenues to better understand pDC pathophysiology and translate pDC-based therapies to the clinic to help patients with hematologic malignancies and other blood diseases undergoing allo-HSCT."

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in the U.S., accounting for 142,670 deaths in 2019.
Lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) is a major subtype of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). Inflammatory
monocyte (IM) infiltration in LUSC is associated with higher mortality. Using LUSC mouse models developed in
our lab, we found that CCL2-mediated recruitment of IMs is necessary and sufficient for LUSC metastasis.
Preliminary RNA-seq data from our LUSC mouse models identify Spon1 upregulation in tumor bearing IMs
compared to IMs from healthy mice. Spon1 is an axonal guidance molecule for the developing nervous system.
Thus, I propose that neuronal axons are recruited into the tumor by IMs. Studies in prostate cancer have
demonstrated that patients with increased innervation have increased cancer growth and metastasis and poor
prognosis. While studies have shown worse prognosis with increased nerve recruitment, the mechanisms of
recruitment are unclear. Given that Spon1 is associated with tissue remodeling and innervation, and that tumor
neurogenesis mediates metastasis through neuronal axons, we hypothesize that (i) IMs release SPON1 into the
TME and (ii) SPON1 drives LUSC metastasis through the recruitment of neuronal axons to the tumor. I propose
to test this hypothesis through the following aims: 1.) Determine the role of SPON1+ IMs on recruitment of axons
into the TME. 2.) Determine the role of SPON1+ IMs have on LUSC tumor progression and metastasis. This
project will create an important intersection between two valuable disciplines to study how IMs, a component of
the immune system, may be recruiting neuronal axons into the tumor to drive LUSC metastasis and disease
progression. This understanding will then lend way for the development of targeted therapeutics against SPON1,
IMs or specific classes of neurons within the tumor. This project has the potential to create a meaningful impact
for patients by opening the door to multiple therapeutic targets. Furthermore, I believe this project and my
comprehensive training plan will prepare me for a successful career by starting me on the F-to-K-to-R pipeline
of an independently funded physician-scientist."

Prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a pivotal role in distributed neural networks orchestrating human behavior.
Notably, PFC dysfunction is observed in numerous debilitating developmental, neurological and psychiatric
disorders. This emphasizes the need for improved knowledge of the physiology implementing goal-directed
behavior to better understand these devastating neuropsychological impairments. The last two decades have
seen an exponential increase of PFC research in animals and humans but numerous questions remain.
Intracranial EEG recording (iEEG) in humans provides a powerful method to assess the spatial-temporal
structure of network activity enabling imaging of both local and inter-areal dynamics. Local neural activation is
measured with high frequency activity (HFA; 70-200 Hz) and single-unit activity (SUA). Inter-areal interactions
are assessed using connectivity metrics including phase slope index, directional phase amplitude coupling,
Granger causality, mutual information and single-trial HFA latency onsets. We combine these local and
network approaches with iEEG recordings to address four core areas of PFC dependent function including
attention, working memory, learning and interpersonal communication. Aim 1 draws on our prior iEEG work
documenting lateral PFC-hippocampal theta band engagement in working memory (WM) and rhythmic PFC-
Parietal attentional sampling in the theta range. Here we test the hypothesis that shared and distinct theta
networks support WM and attention. Critically, we record from the same individual utilizing identical stimuli
differing only in task requirements. In a second study, we employ a naturalistic slot machine gambling task
positing that orbital PFC-insular- anterior cingulate interactions track wheel-spinning expectations
determining both satisfaction and the motivation to spin again. The slot machine expectation manipulation
we employ is banned in casinos given its powerful drive to continue gambling. Aim 2 assesses feedback-
based learning in two studies. One posits lateral PFC-hippocampal interactions in rule-based concept
learning, the other proposes a central role for orbital PFC-hippocampal interactions in flexibly responding to
changing outcome contingencies. Aim 3 proposes novel dual iEEG studies examining how interacting
humans exchange knowledge. One task requires transferring knowledge about items and a second
examines non-verbal social communication. Dual iEEG involves recording from two interacting patients and
preliminary data indicates synchrony between patients in PFC-hippocampal-anterior cingulate circuits during
knowledge exchange. Taken together, the proposed work will advance our understanding of how PFC
dependent networks support goal-directed human behavior."

For clinical application, a critical remaining hurdle for natural killer (NK) cell-based adoptive transfer
immunotherapy (ATI) is the inadequate homing efficiency of ex vivo-expanded effector NKs to the targeted
tumor tissues. Another significant obstacle is the lack of well-established non-invasive tools for monitoring NK
cell trafficking to tumor tissues. Currently, NK cell-based ATI (NK-ATI) responders or non-responders are
identified by changes in serum biomarkers or tumor size, both of which may not occur until weeks or months
after therapy initiation. Serial monitoring of NK cell migration to tumors during ATI could alternatively serve as
an important early biomarker for timely prediction of longitudinal response, thus affording early adjustments to
each individual patient’s therapeutic regimen.
Recently, our studies have demonstrated that sorafenib not only inhibits tumor cell proliferation, but also
promotes antitumor activity of NKs. Therefore, concurrent administration of sorafenib may be critical for
sustained NK activation and cytotoxicity.
We have developed biodegradable sorafenib-eluting microsphere (SEM, with a diameter of 492 ± 34 nm;
nano-SEM) delivery platforms that significantly increase therapeutic efficacy via image-guided transcatheter
IHA delivery. We will develop a new image-guided interventional combination liver cancer immunotherapy
approach including a) image-guided transcatheter IHA infusion of NKs directly into the blood supply of targeted
liver tumor(s) and b) concurrent infusion of nano-SEMs to enhance sorafenib therapeutic efficacy (with minimal
side effects) and to strengthen NK antitumor activity."

Hexacago Health Academy 2.0 (HHA 2.0) builds upon the success of a prior Science Education Partnership
Award in which the Hexacago board, a game board depicting the city of Chicago with an overlay of hexagons,
was used to teach game design, enabling youth to design and play STEM/health games. For HHA 2.0, the
Hexacago board and board game suite will inform the design of Hexacago Health Academy 2.0 Game On (HHA
2.0 GO), a theory-based, game-based STEM/health pathway program for high-performing, rising 11th grade
students from groups currently underrepresented in STEM/health fields who attend Chicago Public Schools. The
multidisciplinary University of Chicago team shares a commitment to using game-based learning experiences to
empower youth with the skills, capacity, and support to achieve optimal health and wellbeing. The team will
design HHA 2.0 GO to incorporate game-based learning. They will also design The UChicago STEM/Health
Pathway Program (UC-SPP), a traditional pathway program, to serve as a comparison arm. HHA 2.0 GO will
rely on the Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT) and the extant literature on the SCCT for racial and ethnic
minorities and STEM careers. Both programs will include a two-week summer intensive and ten academic year
booster sessions. Educational content will cover STEM/health topics, STEM/health careers, and the College
Admissions process. Young people will be randomized to either HHA 2.0 GO (n=72) or UC-SPP (n=72). Youth
not randomized to either program will be asked to serve as a non-intervention control group (n=56). Surveys and
focus groups will be used to compare outcomes across the two intervention groups and the non-intervention
control group during, immediately post, and at one-year post intervention. The study hypothesis is that students
randomized to HHA 2.0 GO will score higher on a composite measure of knowledge, self-efficacy, interest, goals
and behaviors regarding STEM/health topics, STEM/health careers, and the college admissions process short
term and longitudinally compared to those randomized to UC-SPP and compared to those in the non-intervention

10819229,"The overall goal of this proposal is to dissect the molecular mechanisms of metabolic regulation of ATP-citrate
lyase (ACLY) and to characterize ACLY inhibitors for cancer therapy. ACLY is the predominant source of
nucleocytosolic acetyl-CoA, an essential building block for the production of fatty acids, cholesterol,
isoprenoids and protein acetylation. Elevated ACLY activity is found in metabolic disorders, cardiovascular
diseases and many cancers, prompting the development of several ACLY inhibitors. While many ACLY
inhibitors have been developed, only bempedoic acid, which forms an active bempedoyl-CoA adduct in
hepatocytes, has been approved by the FDA for therapeutic use. Risk of hepatocellular carcinoma is elevated
in individuals with metabolic disorders, many of whom may be candidates for treatment with bempedoic acid;
yet metabolic regulation of ACLY activity and its functional role in hepatocellular carcinoma remain poorly
understood. Elevated levels of ACLY acetylation at K540, K546 and K554 and phosphorylation at S455 and
S481, and retention of exon 14 encoding a region with S481, have also been correlated with cancer, thus also
suggesting roles for ACLY posttranslational and posttranscriptional modification in cancer metabolism. ACLY
is an ~500 kD multidomain homotetrameric enzyme that uses citrate, CoA and ATP cosubstrates to produce
oxaloacetate (OAA) and acetyl-CoA. Until recently, the lack of structural information on intact human ACLY has
hampered understanding of its molecular mechanism of catalysis and the structure-based development of
inhibitors. The Wellen lab recently reported on various disease-associated phenotypes associated with
dysregulated ACLY function; and the Marmorstein lab reported on the cryo-EM structures of ACLY in different
reaction states, along with associated biochemical and biophysical studies, to elucidate the molecular basis for
acetyl-CoA production by ACLY. The latter findings lead to several unresolved questions underlying the
metabolic regulation of ACLY and set the stage for the structure-based development of more potent and
selective ACLY inhibitors for therapeutic applications. These recent studies now position the Wellen and
Marmorstein labs to work together to resolve important gaps in knowledge in metabolic regulation and
inhibition of ACLY, through the following specific aims: (1) Evaluate the role of metabolic binders in ACLY
activity, (2) Determine the molecular mechanism of how posttranslational modifications and exon 14 retention
impact ACLY regulation, and (3) Evaluate the molecular mode of action of ACLY inhibitors. Together, these
studies will reveal the molecular mechanisms for how ACLY activity and regulation is mediated by the binding
of metabolites, and posttranscriptional and posttranslational modification and will lead to the rational
development of ACLY drugs to treat cancer."

This grant is in response to PAR-18-206, Bioengineering Research Grants (BRG). Our goal is to adapt a
cutting-edge proteomic network analysis platform, Quantitative Multiplex co-Immunoprecipitation or QMI,
to chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell signaling. We will then use CAR-QMI to characterize signal
transduction network activation downstream of the CAR, to both understand how the CAR instructs a T cell to
attack and destroy cancerous targets, and to make batch-specific predictions about efficacy and side-effect
profiles of CAR T cell products. CAR T cells are a breakthrough anti-cancer therapy that recently won FDA
approval for relapsed B cell lymphomas. A true “personalized medicine”, CAR T cells are manufactured for
each patient from that patient's own T cells by transducing T cells collected by leukopheresis with a viral vector
encoding a CAR. However, since each batch is unique, some batches perform better than others in terms of
producing remissions and/or deleterious and sometimes fatal side effects including cytokine storms and
neurotoxicity. The goal of this project is to develop a “personalized signal transduction network analysis
platform” that can screen each batch of CAR T cells and predict the efficacy and side-effect potential of that
specific batch. Because signal transduction networks integrate information from multiple input sources- for
example costimulatory and immunosuppressive cell surface receptors, patient genetic background, and T-cell
specific history of activation- we hypothesize that this readout will be a powerful predictor of function. Our
preliminary data show that small changes in CAR design parameters such as scFV binding domain affinity
produce measurable changes in signal transduction network state that correlate with functional variables such
as target killing ability and cytokine release. Further, we show that there exists considerable individual-to-
individual variation in batches of CAR T cells produced from different donors. Therefore, the two prerequisites
for an individualized predictive assay are present- variation in our measurement across the population, and the
functional relevance of our measurement to outcome parameters. Our interdisciplinary team consists of
experts in CAR development, signal transduction, proteomics, and bioinformatics. Our ambitious but
achievable goals are to expand the QMI panel to include CAR-specific components; to understand how CAR
design parameters influence both signal transduction network states and functional performance measures;
and to develop a predictive machine learning algorithm that translates QMI-derived signal transduction network
states into a functional biomarker of in vivo clinical efficacy. Successful completion these aims will (1) identify
specific proteins or protein interactions that determine clinically-relevant outcomes such as cytokine production
or cell killing ability, allowing CAR designers to rationally modify the design of CARs to target specific signaling
outcomes; (2) provide clinicians with a test to predict the clinical performance of CAR T cells on a batch-to-
batch basis; and (3) provide the community with a novel analytical platform to measure CAR activity."

Brain tumors (malignant and benign/non-malignant) affect approximately 25 persons per 100,000 people in the
United States annually. It is estimated that there were 1,323,121 people living with a central nervous system
tumor as of the end of 2019. The burden of these tumors is particularly large on children, adolescents and
young adults where brain tumors are among the top causes of cancer and sources of cancer death. With
improvements in treatment for several types of brain tumors, the proportion of this population that are long term
survivors is increasing. As a result, the experience and needs of survivors is increasingly relevant. The Brain
Tumor Epidemiology Consortium (BTEC) was initiated in 2003 to facilitate interactions among brain tumor
epidemiologists and clinicians. Since that date, BTEC has offered yearly meetings for its participants and
created working groups leading to the funding of several consortium projects. To help enhance participation
and increase accessibility of the conference to trainees and all participants, we offer a proposal to the NIH for
partial funding of the 2024 BTEC conference in Mainz, Germany entitled, “Evolving Epidemiology of Brain
Tumor Survivorship.” Our 2024 meeting will focus on brain tumor survivorship across the age spectrum, in
addition to our usual topics including improvements in predicting brain tumor risk and survival. The Mainz
conference follows the tradition of alternating between a North American and a non-North American site each
year."

Despite therapeutic advances, cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death worldwide.
There is thus an urgent need for innovation in CVD research and drug development. One class of molecules
thought to hold particular promise is noncoding RNA, the importance of which was largely unrecognized until the
last decade. The human genome is estimated to encode between 30,000 and 60,000 long noncoding RNAs
(lncRNA), far more than the number of protein coding transcripts, and yet the vast majority remain unstudied.
LncRNAs have been shown to play critical roles in genome organization and orchestration of gene expression
in normal cellular function and disease. Discerning lncRNAs with regulatory functions in cardiovascular health
and disease, and dissecting their molecular mechanisms is a paramount priority, and challenge, for the field.
Using a systems biology approach that relies on human tissues and animal models, clinical data, predictive
bioinformatics and deep molecular phenotyping, we have identified a conserved cis-acting lncRNA, which we
have named CASLR, that is highly expressed in human and mouse atherosclerotic plaques. In this proposal, we
aim to decipher the molecular mechanisms by which this novel lncRNA regulates inflammatory gene expression,
and innate immune responses that drive atherosclerosis progression and ultimately plaque rupture, which can
lead to myocardial infarction or stroke. Our studies will use novel mouse models and innovative 3-dimensional
human vascular explants to test the impact of CASLR inhibition on atherosclerotic inflammation and plaque
burden. Collectively, the proposed investigation into lncRNA CASLR will advance our knowledge of inflammatory
mechanisms of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and its complications, and provide foundational studies
for the design of new therapeutic strategies."

Chicago’s South and West Sides represent one of the nation’s most notable urban environmental justice areas,
facing significant disparities in disease risk and outcomes. The need for environmental health research in
Chicago is highlighted by the dramatic racial/ethnic health disparities observed for multiple diseases and
outcomes. In 2017, the “ChicAgo Center for Health and EnvironmenT (CACHET)” was established – the first
NIH P30 Environmental Health Core Center in the Chicago area. As the CACHET infrastructure to support
scientific equipment, facilities, and other resources that can be shared among environmental health researchers
has grown, so have prospective training opportunities. Because a key CACHET goal is to reduce environmental
health related disparities among residents of Chicago and beyond, our theme is Mitigating Disparities in
Environmental Health- the ideal context for encouraging individuals from diverse backgrounds to pursue careers
in environmental research. In recent years, CACHET has promoted multidisciplinary environmental health
research among clinician, laboratory, and population scientists to understand, evaluate, and ultimately reduce
environmental health related disparities among residents of the region and beyond. As such, a robust structure
is available to support the training of underrepresented undergraduates, with extensive research and mentoring
opportunities by CACHET investigators and ongoing research opportunities in conjunction with investigators
funded by the pilot projects program. Here, we propose to leverage CACHET infrastructure, energy, and its
growing research portfolio to support educational activities that encourage individuals from diverse backgrounds
to pursue further studies or careers in EHS research through the Chicago UP on the Environmental Health
Sciences Program (Chicago UP on EHS). To accomplish this goal, we will: 1) provide 2-year mentored
research experiences and career/skill development to individuals from underrepresented backgrounds at the
undergraduate level (rising juniors from institutions across Chicago) to inspire and prepare them for further study
in the environmental health sciences; 2) provide opportunities for dissemination in Chicago communities as well
as in academic publications or presentations; and 3) create a strong and long-lasting network of support for
students throughout their career journeys. In addition to assembling a dedicated mentor team for each individual,
proving hands-on research training, and engaging support communities, we will also develop a detailed tracking
system to facilitate ongoing communication with program alumni and personalized assistance as needed. The
experienced leadership team has the scientific, educational, and established research programs necessary to
ensure the success of Chicago UP on EHS. Through the Chicago UP on the Environmental Health Sciences
Program, CACHET leadership are committed to positively impacting the career development and leveraging the
exciting projects happening across Chicago to mitigate disparities for training and EHS workforce development."

Malaria continues to be a leading cause of death in many countries and the emergence of drug resistance to
artemisinin-based combination therapy, the last line of defence, poses a huge problem for malaria control.
To halt the spread of drug resistance and contribute to malaria elimination, new therapies with different modes
of action to drugs used clinically, and that are effective against multiple stages of the Plasmodium parasite
life-cycle are urgently required. Plasmodium kinases, essential to both asexual blood stages of the parasite
life-cycle responsible for disease symptoms and the sexual stages responsible for transmission of infection,
have been identified as vulnerable targets for drug discovery. The success of human kinase inhibitors for the
treatment of cancer and other human diseases has resulted in a large amount of chemical matter and
biological data giving insight into kinase function, structure and selectivity, which can be harnessed for the
development of kinase inhibitors against malaria. This project aims to identify a novel compound that is orally
efficacious in an in vivo model of malaria infection by repurposing human kinase inhibitor chemotypes. This
will include the optimization of two advanced compound series, originating from kinase-directed compound
libraries, that display potent antiplasmodium activity. In addition, a phenotypic whole cell screen of a library
of selective human kinase inhibitors will be carried out against Plasmodium falciparum asexual blood-stage
parasites to identify additional chemotypes to enter hit-to-lead medicinal chemistry optimization.
Complementary genetic and proteomic target-identification approaches will be carried out to identify the
target/s of compounds with potent whole cell activity. In cases where assayable Plasmodium kinases are
identified as the primary targets, hit-to-lead optimization will monitor both whole-cell and target activities,
incorporating computer-aided drug design approaches to optimise for potency and selectivity relative to
human kinase off-targets. Promising compounds based on antiplasmodium activity across multiple stages of
the lifecycle, favorable drug metabolism and pharmacokinetic profiles and low toxicity, will be tested in a
humanised mouse model of malaria infection. In addition to identifying a novel antimalarial drug, this research
will set out to identify and chemically validate novel Plasmodium drug targets."
10800341,"Beige adipocytes dissipate energy via non-shivering thermogenesis. Identifying these inducible
thermogenic adipocytes has raised the prospect of treating obesity and metabolic diseases.
Recent findings that beige adipocytes develop in neonatal inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT)
and can be reactivated into functional beige adipocytes in adulthood offer the potential for
targeting these cells in metabolic diseases. Our study focuses on gaps in understanding the
mechanisms of induction and functional characteristics of neonatal beige adipocytes. We
demonstrate that hepatic ketogenesis, which is temporally induced to support metabolic
demands, drives neonatal beige adipogenesis. Our new data showed that the metabolism of
ketone bodies is required to induce beige genes. Aim 1 will determine the role of ketone body
metabolism in iWAT in neonatal beige adipocyte homeostasis. Ketone bodies are potent
modifiers of histones by repressing class I histone deacetylases. Our ChIP-seq analysis in
neonatal iWAT showed higher acetyl histone H3 (H3K27ac), an epigenetic gene activation
marker in the chromatin regions of beige genes. The motif search of H3K27ac enriched
chromatin regions revealed a higher representation of GA binding protein a (GABPa) motifs. A
recent study showed that GABPa induces glycolytic beige adipocytes in adult mice. However,
GABPa target genes in adipocytes and its role in neonatal beige adipogenesis is unclear. Aim 2
will investigate whether GABPa is the molecular driver of neonatal beige adipogenesis. Further
analysis showed elevated levels of several glycolytic genes in neonatal iWAT. Given the limited
fat stores in neonates, we postulate that thermogenesis in neonatal beige adipocytes is fueled
by glucose. By extension, we propose that glucose utilization in beige adipocytes promotes
metabolic homeostasis in neonates. Aim 3 will characterize the thermogenic and metabolic
features of neonatal beige adipocytes. Overall, we hypothesize that ketone bodies
epigenetically activate GABPa in neonatal iWAT to induce beige adipocytes that utilize
glucose for thermogenesis, promoting metabolic homeostasis. Our study will provide
deeper insights into the trigger (ketone bodies), molecular driver (GABPa), and function of
neonatal beige adipocytes. Given that neonatal beige adipocytes could be rejuvenated in
adulthood, our study may lead to novel targets to induce them in treating obesity and metabolic
diseases."

Environmental stimuli (“cues” – sensory information such as sights, sounds, and smells) help organize reward
seeking and decision making. In disease states like addiction drug-related cues can acquire powerful control
over behavior, promoting exaggerated drug intake and relapse. Cues vary in their sensory modality, temporal
profile, and their relationship with one another and behavior. Within this complex sensory landscape, not all
individuals respond the same way to reward cues. For example, some rats, when trained to associate a
discrete, localizable cue with a food reward in a Pavlovian conditioning procedure, develop cue-directed
approach behavior, known at sign tracking. Other rats develop approach behavior directed at the location of
reward delivery, termed goal tracking. In preliminary studies we expand this notion to show that discrete
versus state-based drug-associated cues preferentially evoke relapse of drug seeking in different subsets of
rats. Here, we will investigate how Pavlovian reward-learning strategies (e.g., sign versus goal tracking) predict
an individual’s unique relapse trigger, for greater understanding of vulnerability to addiction. To explore the
neural mechanisms of these behaviors, we focus on the basolateral amygdala (BLA), a critical brain site for
the integration of sensory and emotional information to guide associative learning and goal-directed behavior.
Dopamine neurons, in addition to their classic striatal targets, also project strongly to the BLA, where densely
expressed D1-type dopamine receptors reside. Here, we will examine the role of BLA dopamine and D1
neurons in the emergence and expression of reward-based learning and addiction-like behaviors. In three
Aims, we will test the central hypothesis that individual differences in reward learning strategies reflect
biased responsivity to proximal vs state-based sensory information, resulting in unique vulnerabilities
to addiction-like behavior that are encoded and controlled by dopamine signaling within the BLA."

 Association cortex undergoes protracted development throughout childhood and adolescence. This
extended window of association cortex plasticity is understood to enhance executive and socioemotional
functioning, whereas experiences that diminish plasticity—such as environmental adversity—confer risk for
psychopathology. At present, the biological origins of prolonged association cortex plasticity in humans remain
under characterized, precluding a mechanistic understanding of how neurodevelopmental malleability interacts
with the environment to foster either resilience or psychiatric vulnerability. Animal studies of cortical plasticity
have identified maturational increases in inhibitory neurotransmission and cortical myelination as two key
biological regulators of plasticity. As inhibition and myelination increase and the murine cortex transitions from
plastic to mature, intrinsic cortical activity transitions from widespread and synchronized (producing high
amplitude neural recordings) to suppressed and sparse — producing low amplitude recordings. This
development-linked shift in intrinsic activity amplitude thus provides an animal model-informed, functional
readout of local circuit plasticity. We recently leveraged this functional marker in humans and found that
declines in the amplitude of intrinsic fMRI fluctuations (termed fluctuation amplitude) were coupled to the
maturation of cortical myelin and temporally unfolded along a hierarchical, sensorimotor-association cortical
axis (Sydnor et al., Nature Neuroscience 2023). Here we will map the normative progression of developmental
plasticity from sensory to association cortex and link precocious reductions in association cortex plasticity to
transdiagnostic overall psychopathology. Building upon our initial work examining plasticity measures in one
cross-sectional dataset, we propose to generalize our findings to two additional cross-sectional datasets (the
HCP-Development and the Healthy Brain Network; total n=6,530) and map within-participant change using the
ABCD study (n=11,563). These datasets will allow us to comprehensively map the development of our
functional measure of plasticity (Aim 1) and link it to both the development of a major plasticity restricting factor
(intracortical myelin; Aim 2). Next, we will determine whether lower socioeconomic status (SES) is associated
with accelerated closure of plasticity in association cortex (Aim 3), and finally delineate links to trans-diagnostic
overall psychopathology (Aim 4). This research program capitalizes upon a highly successful first project
period (>60 publications) and robust preliminary data and a highly cohesive team of UPenn investigators with
expertise in neurodevelopmental psychopathology and neuroinformatics (Satterthwaite), network science and
machine learning (Bassett), imaging statistics (Shinohara), psychometrics (Moore), and developmental
psychology (Mackey). Together, this innovative proposal will provide compelling evidence that development of
association cortex plasticity is critical for transdiagnostic psychopathology."

Depression affects half of those suffering from Parkinson's disease (PD), significantly reducing quality of life,
increasing disability and accelerating disease progression. However, traditional antidepressants are largely
ineffective in PD and there are no targeted, effective treatments for depression in Parkinson's disease (dPD).
Identifying new targets and evaluating new interventions for dPD is therefore critically important. A loss of
synapses in neural circuitry responsible for movement is central to the pathology of PD, secondary to a toxic
build-up of alpha-synuclein. Depression often occurs before the onset of motor symptoms in PD, reflecting the
presence of pathology beyond motor circuitry. dPD is therefore likely neuroanatomically distinct from PD and
from major depressive disorder (MDD). We will identify the synaptic- and network-level mechanisms that are
unique to dPD, which could represent important new treatment targets. Specifically, we will use PET to measure
synaptic density (Aim 1), and fMRI functional connectivity to measure network function (Aim 2) across dPD, PD
(no depression), MDD and HC groups, allowing for the identification of synaptic- and network-level mechanisms
that are unique to dPD. The proposed study builds on our existing PET/fMRI work in PD and in MDD showing a)
almost 50% lower synaptic density in the substantia nigra in PD compared to HCs and b) lower synaptic density
is associated with higher severity depression, as well as network dysfunction, in MDD. Further, our pilot data
supports our hypothesis that there is a distinct pattern of synaptic loss in PD depression – specifically in mood-
related circuitry. We also propose to target synaptic deficits in dPD using the rapid-acting antidepressant
ketamine, whose primary mechanism of action is thought to be an increase in synaptic connections (Aim 3). We
have shown that in MDD individuals with a synaptic deficit, a single dose of ketamine resulted in a robust increase
in synaptic (SV2A) density. This increase in synaptic density was associated with a reduction in depression
severity, providing the first in vivo evidence that an increase in synaptic connections underlies ketamine's
therapeutic actions in humans. We will use PET to quantify synaptic density before and 24-hours after a single
subanesthetic dose of ketamine in a subset of individuals with dPD to examine the antidepressant and
mechanistic effects of ketamine in PD for the first time. Taking together the strong mechanistic rationale, the
limitations of traditional antidepressants in PD and the substantial untapped potential of ketamine to alleviate
depression in PD, the proposed work is highly significant and timely. We firmly believe that this innovative work
will drive forward discovery of critically-needed targeted, effective treatments for depression in PD."

Long-term memories are often formed when the event involves a threat and triggers survival behavior. Sensory cues present
during the threat tend to elicit defensive behaviors when they occur in the future, indicating that a long-term association has
formed between the cue and the threat. While it is known for decades that the transformation of associative memories from
labile state to long-term form requires new protein synthesis in discrete brain regions, there is a knowledge gap in the
understanding of specific neural pathways that are recruited during memory consolidation and the mechanisms that control
the dynamics of protein synthesis in these pathways. This knowledge is important not only for gaining a deeper
understanding of spatiotemporally resolved protein synthesis in memory processes but also for targeted therapeutic
intervention in disorders of emotional memories such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is characterized by
over-consolidation of memory about the traumatic event, inability to discriminate innocuous stimuli from ones that predict
danger, and maladaptive coping strategies. Using Pavlovian and instrumental threat conditioning paradigms in mice, this
proposal aims to understand the neurobiological substrates for the modulation of emotional memories by threat intensity
and volitional control – both of which are disrupted in PTSD. Two key modes for protein synthesis, namely the eukaryotic
initiation factor 2 (eIF2) and eIF4E-dependent translation, are thought to be crucial for associative emotional memories.
The proposed study will use bidirectional strategies to regulate these modes of translation in specific prefrontal pathways
connecting with deep brain regions, including the basolateral amygdala and paraventricular thalamus. Furthermore, this
work will survey learning-induced physiological changes in the brain at the level of cellular-resolution molecular signaling.
Finally, the study plans to determine the changes in the translation landscape in specific prefrontal pathways during the
consolidation of diverse emotional memories that result in cue-elicited freezing or avoidance. To achieve these goals, mouse
models will be used in combination with viral-mediated gene transfer, chemogenetics, pharmacology, imaging, molecular
profiling, and behavior. Findings from this study have the potential to transform the field of memory research by elucidating
the molecular players that govern the consolidation of long-term memories in both healthy and diseased brain states."

 The proposed study will help substantially advance understanding of the immunology,
biology, and detection of syphilis, through the study of newly identified cases in Lima, Peru,
where syphilis is hyper-endemic. Syphilis remains a serious disease with significant adverse
clinical outcomes. Despite over 100 years of research in the biology of Treponema pallidum
sub. pallidum, the bacterial pathogen that causes syphilis, the use of modern methods to study
this infection is just beginning, with our team spearheading some of this work. Our study builds
on the research infrastructure and capacity created through two previously NIH-funded studies,
the “Picasso Study” (NIH/NIAID R01AI09972) and “Picasso 2” (NIH/NIAID R01AI139265) as
well as an SBIR grant (R43AI149804). In this proposal, investigators from USC, UPCH, UW,
and Antigen Discovery will work together to accomplish the proposed three aims and fill critical
gaps in the understanding of syphilis.
 Aim 1: Clinical cohort and epidemiology — Hypothesizing that those with a first versus
repeat syphilis infection will demonstrate different immunological profiles, we will conduct a
prospective study of incident syphilis cases, comparing those with and without a history of prior
syphilis infection. We will a) recruit, treat, and follow 50 individuals with incident syphilis without
prior infection and 100 individuals with repeat syphilis infection. We will compare individuals with
de novo versus repeat infection with two outcomes: 1.the proportion with clinical manifestations
of syphilis at diagnosis and 2. rates of re-infection during follow-up. Aim 2: Immunological —
Hypothesizing that the clinical manifestations and immunologic responses (antibody responses
and T cell activation) will differ between individuals with repeat infection versus de novo incident
syphilis infection (active versus treated infection), we will investigate antigens associated with
reinfection, identify TP proteins that activate a CD4 T cell response, and document the T cell
receptor response to infection and treatment. Aim 3: Transcriptomics — we will analyze the
host transcriptome to identify diagnostic signatures for syphilis. Assays for syphilis remain
limited in their ability to differentiate between active and resolved infection. In this study, RNA-
seq data from whole blood collected pre and post treatment will be used to identify transcription
pathways involved in functional immunity to syphilis.
 Building on our years of ongoing collaborative work in syphilis pathogeneses and
diagnostics, this proposal will focus on new areas of syphilis immunology to inform vaccine
discovery and novel diagnostic test development."

 As the average age of first-time mothers in the United States increases, the prevalence of assisted
reproductive technologies (ARTs) including oocyte cryopreservation, continues to rise. Cryopreservation has
been demonstrated to reduce expression of genes associated with cell cycle progression, and use of
cryopreserved ova is correlated with lower live birth rates compared with fresh eggs. Recently, extracellular
vesicles (EVs, lipid-bound vesicles secreted by cells which contain regulatory molecules) have shown promise
in supporting the recovery or function of damaged cells. In reproductive EVs, miRNAs have been of particular
interest owing to their potential ability to regulate key signaling pathways associated with developmental
competence. Supplementation of EVs from ovarian follicular fluid (ffEV) have been shown to improve in vitro
blastocyst production and, in our laboratory, enhance the domestic cat cumulus-oocyte complex’s (COC) ability
to resume meiosis following vitrification. In this proposal, we describe a series of studies aimed at elucidating
the physiological role(s) of miRNAs in ffEVs and exploring their therapeutic potential using the domestic cat as
a model for human ARTs. As exogenous gonadotropin stimulation protocols are known to modify follicular gene
expression and function, including composition of ffEVs, we will apply microfluidic technology to mimic
gonadotropin exposure patterns on granulosa cells in vitro. Specific Aim 1 improves our knowledge of the in vitro
generation of EVs by comparing the molecular (miRNA, mRNA, protein) composition of EVs produced under
‘natural estrus’ versus ‘ovarian stimulation’ conditions in vitro against in vivo derived ffEVs, and their efficacy in
modulating COC gene expression, developmental competence, and embryo quality. Beyond improving our
understanding of gonadotropin control of EV biogenesis, this approach aims to improve our ability to consistently
produce high quality EVs in vitro, which is vital to their future application to ARTs. Specific Aim 2 will elucidate
the functional relevance of miRNAs enriched in ffEVs using a two-pronged approach: selectively inhibiting three
highly expressed endogenous miRNA in ffEVs (via miRNA inhibitors), and loading three under-expressed
exogenous miRNA (via miRNA mimics). The proposal targets heat shock 70 kDA protein expression to modulate
the cell stress-response and developmental competence. We will evaluate the bioavailability and intracellular
localization of miRNA modified-ffEVs and (in single and multiple miRNA combinations) their ability to alter COC
gene and protein expression and subsequent influence on vitrified oocyte cryo-recuperation and embryonic
development. Cumulatively, these studies will generate new insight into miRNA-mediated intrafollicular
communication and the downstream effects of follicular fluid EVs on oocytes, develop a new system for
biomimetic reproductive EV production in vitro, and assess the utility of ffEVs for future therapeutic application
to ARTs, including oocyte vitrification.

 Hypertension (HTN) is the most prevalent modifiable risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and disorders
directly influencing CVD (i.e., diabetes, chronic kidney disease, obstructive sleep apnea, etc.). Despite lifestyle
changes and drug therapy advances, ~20-30% of patients with treated HTN are “resistant” to (require ≥3)
antihypertensive drugs. TRH is generally thought to originate through volume overload and autonomic nervous
system (ANS) dysfunction that impairs immune function and inflammatory response. However, few treatment
options are available for patients with TRH and promising procedures (e.g., renal artery sympathetic denervation)
remain inaccessible to most. Thus, a mechanism-based breakthrough is imperative to foster development of
novel medical-based strategies to better control blood pressure (BP) and potentially cure and/or prevent TRH.
 Our prior funding period provides strong evidence for an altered gut microbiota-gut leakiness-
neuroinflammation interaction hypothesis in which gut dysbiosis and gut leakiness, combined with
neuroinflammation, perpetuate neurogenic HTN and contribute to TRH and possibly to racial disparities in TRH.
We also showed that minocycline, an antibiotic with anti-inflammatory properties, appears to reduce BP in animal
HTN models as well as among patients with TRH. In this renewal application, we propose to elucidate
mechanisms that underlie the effects of minocycline on BP-lowering in White and African American individuals
with TRH. Our overarching objective is to test the hypothesis that minocycline rebalances gut dysbiosis, namely
by increasing butyrate-producing functional capacity, attenuating gut-mediated inflammatory response and gut
leakiness, and that these effects explain BP-lowering effects in TRH.
 Four specific aims are proposed to support/refute this altered gut microbiota-gut leakiness-
neuroinflammation interaction hypothesis in TRH: Aim 1 will investigate the hypothesis that minocycline alters
gut microbiota (primarily butyrate-producing capacity) that mediates minocycline-induced BP lowering in TRH.
Aim 2 will assess the extent to which minocycline alters gut-associated inflammation and gut leakiness, and their
response with BP changes after minocycline treatment. Aim 3 will evaluate the hypothesis that minocycline
reduces neuroinflammation in TRH. Aim 4 will evaluate the hypothesis that these effects of minocycline differ in
White versus African American individuals. Together, these studies will elucidate ANS-based mechanisms of
host-microbiota interactions in TRH, evaluate potential of minocycline to reduce TRH, and serve as proof of
concept for other therapeutic options that rebalance microbiota or mitigate TRH-associated inflammation, to
improve BP control in patients with TRH, who remain at high risk."

Aging is the principal risk factor for age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a neurodegenerative disease
characterized by the irreversible loss of vision. Clinical and mouse studies indicate that consumption of diets with
higher dietary glycemic indices increase AMD risk. Atrophy of the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) layer is an
AMD hallmark that precedes photoreceptor cell loss. However, the mechanisms underlying RPE impairment with
aging and exacerbation by poor diet are unclear. Thus, therapeutic approaches to maintain RPE function with
aging and prevent AMD are yet to be developed. Epigenetic processes (DNA modifications and chromatin
accessibility) in the RPE may play a central mechanistic role in the pathogenesis and progression of AMD. DNA
modifications, [cytosine base methylation and hydroxymethylation (mC and hmC respectively)], are fundamental
regulators of DNA accessibility and gene regulation/expression. A barrier to progress in understanding the role
of epigenetic mechanisms in RPE aging and DNA modifications in particular, has been the lack of quantitatively
accurate, genome-wide data in this specific cell type. Without the knowledge of the specific genomic locations
of altered modifications/accessibility with aging it is impossible to design mechanistic studies that unravel the
functional effects of epigenetic reconfiguration. Therefore, the critical next step for the field is to generate these
genome-wide maps of mC and hmC in CG and CH contexts and genomic accessibility in the primary cellular
site of AMD pathogenesis, the RPE, from both sexes across the lifespan. To address this critical issue, we have
developed a cell-type specific, tamoxifen-inducible Cre, transgenic NuTRAP model to allow isolation of nucleic
acids (DNA & RNA), specifically from RPE cells. In Aim 1, changes in mC/hmC and chromatin accessibility
patterns with aging will be examined by whole genome oxidative bisulfite sequencing (WGoxBS) and ATAC-seq
in RPE. In Aim 2, the RPE-specific differential changes in the translatome will be identified as a function of aging.
In prior studies we have determined that age-related DNA modification changes can be prevented by caloric
restriction. In aim 3, we will interrogate the potential of Western and ketogenic dietary patterns, in combination
with impaired oxidative stress resolution pathways, to exacerbate or ameliorate changes in the RPE epigenome
and gene expression profiles. Paired epigenomic and transcriptomic data from the same animals will be used
to: 1) assess aging with ‘epigenetic clocks’ in RPE, 2) determine the role of altered modification patterns in age-
and dietary/oxidative stress- related changes in gene expression, 3) determine enrichment of differential
modifications/accessibility in regulatory regions of the genome, and 4) identify and refine genomic loci for
epigenome editing. These studies will determine critical genomic regions with altered DNA modification patterns
that can be manipulated in future interventional studies. The ultimate goal of the research is to develop clinical
interventions that target the RPE epigenome to maintain visual function with aging and prevent AMD."

This R01 responds to PAS-20-160 (Small R01s for Clinical Trials Targeting Diseases within the Mission of
NIDDK, supporting “short-term exploratory clinical trials” to gather pilot data to “support a future larger fully-
powered trial affecting important health outcomes”). The objective of this application is to test the early effects
and implementation of an enhanced community health worker (CHW) model (T1DTechCHW) that encourages
and supports diabetes technology use in young adults from underrepresented minority groups (YA-URMs) with
type 1 diabetes (T1D). YA-URMs are the largest growing population with T1D in the United States, and
demonstrate wide racial-ethnic inequity in glycemic, hospitalization, and mortality outcomes. Emerging
evidence by our group and others has demonstrated racial-ethnic inequity in use of diabetes technologies,
such as insulin pump therapy and continuous glucose monitors (CGM), which may be contributing to poor
outcomes and represents a potential intervention target. Our work also highlights unique patient, provider, and
system-level barriers to technology use that go beyond insurance coverage. CHWs are an evidence-based,
cost-effective, scalable work force that can address multi-level barriers to diabetes technology use in YA-URMs
with T1D, but have not previously been tested in this capacity. CHWs are unique in their ability to share lived
experiences and advocate for patients from underserved communities, acting as links between community and
health system instead of being a part of the system in which YA-URMs have low trust. Building off our prior
research, grounded in self-determination theory, and our extensive clinical experience with YA-URMs with T1D
in the Supporting Emerging Adults with Diabetes (SEAD) program, our central hypothesis is that CHWs will
increase technology use by becoming part of the T1D team-based care approach, using their unique
position to engender trust, and increase YA-URM autonomy, competence, and social support, while also filling
provider workforce gaps. YA-aged CHWs will address commonly cited barriers to technology use by providing
YA-URMs with T1D technology education, goal-setting, peer support, and social needs management, while
shifting insurance approval work from providers and better aligning patient-provider priorities. We will conduct a
6-month randomized controlled trial in which YA-URMs will be randomized to T1DTechCHW or usual care. We
will recruit from endocrinology and primary care practices in a large safety-net health system in the Bronx, NY.
Our specific aims are to: 1) evaluate T1DTechCHW effects on technology initiation and continued use over 6
months and 2) evaluate T1DTechCHW implementation using Proctor’s Taxonomy of Implementation
Outcomes: feasibility, adoption, fidelity, and cost. To strengthen rigor: we leverage a preexisting integrated
CHW program; engage stakeholders to increase acceptability and uptake; and boost generalizability by
recruiting from primary care and endocrinology practices. This small R01 trial is the next step to test a
sustainable model aimed at root causes of disparities and will advance the field of T1D disparities research."

Surprisingly, platelets are capable of bidirectional interactions with their microenvironment
through basic cellular processes that are largely unexplored. In this R35 proposal, we expand on
our active research themes: one unraveling the mechanistic role of exocytosis in hemostasis and
the other investigating endocytosis as an entry pathway to define the role of platelets in innate
immunity. By linking these two areas, we can gain deeper insights into how platelet interact with
their microenvironments. Despite advances in understanding signaling from vascular damage
detection, our view of how activated platelets execute the steps needed for clot formation is
limited. We have probed the mechanisms of platelet secretion and how it affects hemostasis,
using genetically altered models, and determined that modulating secretion controls thrombus
growth without compromising hemostasis. To build on that advance, a better understanding of
platelet exocytosis is clearly needed so logical therapeutic strategies can be developed. Our work
on platelet endocytosis, endo-lysosomal trafficking, and processing of endocytosed cargo led to
the discovery that platelets take up pathogens, e.g., viruses, and are activated. Increasingly,
platelets are being associated with immune responses, yet the mechanisms underlying these
non-hemostatic functions are largely unknown. Very little is known about platelet endocytosis
and next to nothing is known about how platelets traffic and process endocytosed material. Our
R35 research program seeks to fill these gaps in knowledge by taking a holistic approach to the
study of platelet “cell biology”. Building on our innovative past work (>50 publications), we will
further define platelet membrane trafficking (endocytosis, exocytosis, cargo sorting/processing,
etc.). We hypothesize that bidirectional trafficking processes, endo- and exocytosis, are essential
for platelet-specific functions, specifically thrombosis and innate immune responses. To address
this hypothesis, we will examine platelet exocytosis and endocytosis at mechanistic and
physiological levels using an extensive suite of reagents, transgenic mouse strains, and
technologies. Going forward, we will use these powerful tools and approaches to define how
platelet membrane trafficking (both exo- and endocytosis) affects hemostasis/thrombosis and
immune responses at molecular and organismal levels. The data generated are directly
applicable to the understanding and treatment of human disease, especially thrombotic diseases
which accounts for 1 in 4 deaths world-wide and chronic viremia, e.g., AIDS/HIV1, which
increases CVD risk."
10815728,"The proposed research seeks to understand plausible biological mechanisms whereby different injectable
contraceptives may or may not affect susceptibility to infections such as HIV-1. High usage of injectable
contraceptives correlates with high prevalence of HIV-1 infection in sub-Saharan Africa and South Africa. A
strong gender bias for HIV-1 infection occurs towards young women in sub-Saharan Africa. Depo-
medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA-IM), a three-monthly, intramuscular (IM) injection of 150 mg MPA is the
most commonly used, while Norethisterone enanthate (NET-EN), a two-monthly, IM injection of 200 mg NET-
EN is widely used in South Africa, especially among young women. Higher quality observational clinical data
show a significant 40-50% increased risk of HIV-1 acquisition compared to no hormonal contraception for
DMPA-IM. Limited observational studies found no significant increased risk for HIV-1 acquisition compared to
no hormonal contraception for NET-EN, while two head-to-head comparisons found a potential 32-40%
increase in HIV-1 risk for DMPA-IM versus NET-EN users. Recent results from the randomized ECHO trial do
not inform on the risk of HIV-1 infection of DMPA-IM compared to NET-EN, or for DMPA-IM compared to no
hormonal contraception. However, they do suggest progestin-specific effects with a best estimate of 23-29%
increased risk for DMPA-IM compared to a levonorgestrel-containing implant over only 18 months. It is
possible that a 32-40% difference in HIV-1 risk between DMPA-IM and NET-EN, taking into account both
vertical and horizontal transmission, may have an important impact on the epidemic over a longer time period
in high risk populations and may be highly relevant for individual women who desire informed choice. Given the
potential for confounding factors in observational studies, a definitive answer as to the relative HIV-1 risks of
DMPA-IM and NET-EN remains elusive. Another approach to gaining insights into the relative risks of DMPA-
IM versus NET-EN is to obtain and evaluate high quality clinical biological data on responses strongly
implicated in HIV-1 acquisition from women randomized to DMPA-IM and NET-EN. We will obtain archived
samples from such a randomized trial (The WHICH (part 1) trial), and measure biomarkers of immune function
and other potential markers of HIV-1 susceptibility. We will also perform a series of in vivo and ex vivo
mechanistic studies to investigate plausible biological mechanisms for MPA and NET for HIV-1 acquisition and
determine how those results correlate with the clinical data. The results will provide insight into whether and
how DMPA-IM and NET-EN exert different biological effects, with implications for HIV-1 acquisition in women.
The results will contribute significantly to scientific knowledge in the contraception and HIV-1 fields. They are
likely to impact on clinical practice, health policy and international guidelines, to either reassure the
interchangeable use or suggest preferential use of one of these injectable contraceptives over the other in
populations at high risk of HIV-1 infection."

Objective: The principal mission of the Stanford K12 Clinician-Scientist Career Development Program is to
fund a premier clinician-scientist/clinician investigator training program, designed to leverage excellence in
basic, translational and clinical research to develop new clinician-scientists who will emerge as productive,
independent physician scientists and strong leaders across the eye and vision research community.
Rationale & Design: Through this institutional career development award, we will incorporate a rigorous
program with outstanding vision research faculty serving in various mentor and supervisor roles,
comprehensive eye and vision courses, and significant clinical ophthalmologic exposure to facilitate future
applications of vision research. The Byers Eye Institute along with the broader vision research community at
Stanford University has a proven record of success in mentoring, along with sufficient external support to
support all scholars.
Key Activities in the Training Plan: In this program, participating faculty will lend their expertise by serving
across Mentoring Groups, an Executive Committee, and an External Advisory Board to help build, review and
support each Scholar's career development plan. As recent K-awardees, additional junior faculty will also serve
in the Near-Peer Mentoring Committee to lend additional advice and guidance and build a community of
mutual support for Scholars. Scholars will be partnered with mentors appropriate to their scientific focus and
will be trained in basic or clinically relevant research, as well as additional essential skills meant to propel their
transition to independence, such as statistics, scientific writing, grantsmanship, ethics, leadership and the
responsible conduct of research. Each program will be customized for each Scholar according to their specific
interests, skills and background, needs, and career goals.
Planned duration of appointments and projected number of scholars: With an emphasis on recruiting
strong applications from women and under-represented minority applicants, a maximum of 3 postdoctoral
Scholars will be selected each year after their completion of a post-residency clinical fellowship in
ophthalmology. K12 Scholars will typically spend 2 years in the program.
Intended scholar outcomes: Successful outcomes will be measured by productivity in papers and
presentations, successful transition to independent K awards and later conversion to R-funded research, and
impact on the field of eye and vision research as well as clinical ophthalmology. Stanford has robust mentoring
systems, strong curriculum, and solid infrastructure in place to prepare Scholars for research independence.
Together, the program's myriad resources will create a supportive environment for K12 Scholars throughout
the duration of the program."
10815798,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Although smoking is a leading risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), other factors likely
contribute to disease pathogenesis since only a subset of smokers develop COPD. Tissue hypoxia related to
acute exacerbations or physical activity impairs gut epithelial barrier function in COPD and may result in microbial
translocation, or movement of microbes or microbial products across the intestinal mucosa. Once in circulation,
these microbial products may cause immune cell activation or direct lung injury, augmenting inflammation and
lung function decline in patients with COPD. Although studies of microbial translocation have largely focused on
the translocation of bacteria, we have preliminary data suggesting that fungal translocation occurs in smokers
and may contribute to COPD pathogenesis. We show that 1,3 beta-d-glucan (BDG), a pattern associated
molecular pattern that is a major polysaccharide component of the fungal cell wall, is elevated in COPD patients
in the absence of invasive fungal infection and correlates with lung function, symptoms, and exacerbations. In
vitro, BDG increases lung epithelial cell expression of inflammatory cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of
COPD. With this project, we will test the overarching hypothesis that impaired gut epithelial barrier integrity in
COPD patients leads to fungal microbial translocation that contributes to lung function decline and worse
respiratory morbidity through heightened immune cell activation and direct lung pathogenic effects. Aim 1 will
assess the relationship between gut epithelial barrier integrity measured by the lactulose/mannitol differential
sugar absorption test, lung function, respiratory morbidity (symptoms, exacerbations), and circulating BDG levels
in a cohort of current and former smokers with COPD. Aim 2 will determine the association between circulating
BDG levels, immune cell activation, prospective exacerbations, and two-year change in lung function, symptoms,
and CT indices of emphysema and airways in COPD. Aim 3 will determine whether BDG increases cytokine
expression and secreted protein levels by binding to the lung epithelial cell pattern recognition receptors Dectin-
1 and EphA2 in human bronchial epithelial cells in vitro, and if this effect is potentiated by co-exposure to cigarette
smoke. Aim 3 will also investigate if BDG effects on cytokine expression and secreted protein levels are
attenuated by treatment with metformin. At the completion of this project, we will have gained critical insight into
the role of microbial translocation in COPD pathogenesis and will have built the foundation for future clinical trials
targeting the gut-lung axis by either improving gut epithelial barrier function, blocking BDG’s actions, or
modulating BDG’s downstream effects as a novel approach to therapy in COPD."

Molecular-genetic studies have illuminated the primary pathway of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, a
relatively long chronic prodromal period of the disease, and the cascade of molecular events underlying the
AD-associated synaptic and neuronal loss and neurodegeneration in the aging brain, have not yet been fully
elucidated. Aging is the most common risk factor contributing to the decline of both the immune system and
brain function.
Recently, we, and others, demonstrated that, surprisingly, the adaptive immune system is involved in
Alzheimer’s disease. As this is a newly emergent field, the molecular mechanisms of interactions between
adaptive immunity and AD remains unknown. We hypothesize that harmful populations of γδT-cells or brain-
infiltrating αβT-cells (CD8+ T-cells) responding to aberrantly expressed antigens in the brain contribute to AD
pathology. In our recent report and in our preliminary data, we found that the depletion of B-cells or T-cells (
CD8+ T cells) in AD model mice reduces AD-associated pathology. Although we, and others, detected the T-
cells in the human and mouse brain, the hypervariable immunogene TCR-repertoires and molecular identities
of populations of T-cells in the brain have not yet been determined. This implies that the origin and functional
connections of adaptive immune and brain cells remain unknown. We have developed and applied highly
sensitive assays to track TCR repertoires in AD patients versus controls. On the other hand, we found highly
increased epigenomic chromatin accessibility and upregulation of adaptive immune response genes (MHC
complex and other genes) in the neuronal and non-neuronal residential cells in the AD brain. We will apply
large-scale, innovative, high-throughput genomic technologies for the analysis of AD-mouse models and a
large collection of clinically characterized brain specimens from both AD and non-demented subjects. We will
conduct a molecular dissection of the neuronal- adaptive immune- genomic axis to identify novel integrative
factors contributing to AD pathogenesis or to the protection of brain neurons in the aging process."

The objective of this project is to understand the role of the mechanistic Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) pathway
in the association between energy imbalance and prognosis in patients with breast cancer and the potential
benefits of targeting mTOR to inhibit its activation to improve clinical outcomes in these patients. Energy
imbalance is an important factor affecting breast cancer prognosis. Although behavioral interventions leading
to weight reduction have shown a potential to reduce breast cancer recurrence and mortality rates, the
biological mechanisms between obesity and breast cancer outcomes are not entirely clear. It is crucial to
identify mechanisms through which overall and central adiposity exert their effects. Lifestyle interventions may
not be applicable or effective for all women with breast cancer; targeting the underlying biological mechanisms
may open new opportunities to improve the prognosis for a greater number of patients. We propose that
mTOR pathway signaling in breast tumors is a significant and targetable mechanism mediating energy
imbalance and breast cancer prognosis. Our preliminary data show a positive linear association of body mass
index and waist circumference with mTOR pathway activation, as indicated by phosphorylated mTOR (p-
mTOR) expression levels, in patients with breast cancer overall and in estrogen receptor-negative (ER-)
tumors. Also, from the expression of several phospho-proteins, higher vs. lower levels of mTOR pathway
activities are associated with disease-free survival. The main weaknesses of these data are the lack of
information on treatment, and the number of patients in subtypes is small. We will address these research
gaps in our proposed Pathways Study, a prospective cohort study of 4,505 women who had received a
diagnosis of incident primary invasive breast cancer. In this cohort, we have documented 571 recurrences, 420
second primary cancers, and 880 deaths with data on ER status. We will assess mTOR pathway activities
using a 10-marker immunohistochemistry panel in tumor tissue samples. We will evaluate the association
between body size (BMI, waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio) and mTOR pathway activation in breast
tumors (Aim 1) and assess the association of mTOR pathway activation independently and jointly with body
size on breast cancer outcomes (Aim 2). To further understand the role of the mTOR pathway in prevention,
we will examine whether the status of non-obesity, exercise, and metformin use, as interventions of energy
imbalance, affects patient outcomes through mTOR pathway regulation (Aim 3). Our proposal is innovative in
employing a large panel of phospho-protein expression, comprehensive clinical and epidemiologic data, and
adequate statistical power for ER- breast cancer subtype. The results will improve our understanding of the
extent to which mTOR pathway activation, which is modifiable in early-stage breast cancer, may alleviate the
influence of energy imbalance on breast cancer prognosis and shed light on the potential for promoting energy
balance and using mTOR inhibitors as a combination strategy to improve clinical outcomes."

 The principal goal of this new grant cycle is to uncover the origin and nature of uniqueness
of the cerebral cortex of the human, and non-human primates (NHP), particularly the association
areas such as the prefrontal cortex, that underlie the highest level of our cognitive capacities
and are thought to be undermined in neuropsychiatric disorders including drug abuse. Although
basic principles of cortical development in all mammals are similar, there are important
quantitative and qualitative evolutionary innovations that were introduced in primates since their
split from the rodent lineage about 60 million years ago. Thus, our strategy will be to study in
parallel the developmental events in the NHP (macaque) and human skin-cell-derived iPSC
cortex-mimicking cultures by using the most advanced molecular and cell biological methods
available, including comparative high resolution single-cell mRNA sequencing, advanced
confocal and light-sheet imaging, and in utero and ex utero functional manipulation of neural
stem cells. We will complete and further augment our ongoing high-resolution single-cell mRNA
sequencing and gain insight through bioinformatic gene network analysis in three species:
macaque, human, and mouse. We will first investigate the genetic determinants of primate-
specific stem cell subtypes, using gene clustering analysis at the transcriptome level, and
determine how this impacts the cortical expansion process through functional studies (Aim #1).
As a next step, we will examine genes and regulatory elements involved in emergence of areal
and laminar specific distinction in monkey embryonic cortex and human iPSC 3D cortex
mimicking cultures, generated from skin fibroblasts, to identify unique signatures of human and
nonhuman primate-specific gene expression in evolutionarily new cortical areas such as
prefrontal cortex (Aim #2). Finally, we will examine how cortical neuropil and the growth and
patterning of white matter contribute to cortical area differences and drive primate-specific
cortical gyrification (Aim #3). Although the proposed research is time-consuming, logistically
difficult and costly, it is essential if we are to understand the biological basis of our humanity and
the pathogenesis of some high order cognitive disorders, including drug abuse. We have
established primate precisely timed breeding facilities at Yale, as well as mastered and modified
essential methodology and already have obtained a substantial amount of high impact
information which alone, or in combination, can give insight into elusive neuropsychiatric
disorders and neuronal susceptibility to prenatal exposure to drugs of therapy and abuse."

Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) is the largest long-term study of brain development and child
health in the United States. The ABCD Research Consortium consists of 21 research sites across the country,
a Coordinating Center, and a Data Analysis and Informatics Resource Center. In its first five years, under
RFA-DA-15-015, ABCD enrolled a diverse sample of 11,878 9-10 year olds from across the consortium, and
will track their biological and behavioral development through adolescence into young adulthood.
All participants received a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging,
neuropsychological testing, bioassays, careful assessment of substance use, mental health, physical health,
and culture and environment. A similar detailed assessment recurs every 2 years. Interim in-person annual
interviews and mid-year telephone or mobile app assessments provide refined temporal resolution of
developmental changes and life events that occur over time with minimal burden to participating youth and
parents. Intensive efforts are made to keep the vast majority of participants involved with the study through
adolescence and beyond, and retention rates thus far are very high. Neuroimaging has expanded our
understanding of brain development from childhood into adulthood. Using this and other cutting-edge
technologies, ABCD can determine how different kinds of youth experiences (such as sports, school
involvement, extracurricular activities, videogames, social media, unhealthy sleep patterns, and vaping)
interact with each other and with a child’s changing biology to affect brain development and social, behavioral,
academic, health, and other outcomes.
Data, securely and privately shared with the scientific community, will enable investigators to: (1) describe
individual developmental pathways in terms of neural, cognitive, emotional, and academic functioning, and
influencing factors; (2) develop national standards of healthy brain development; (3) investigate the roles and
interaction of genes and the environment on development; (4) examine how physical activity, sleep, screen
time, sports injuries (including traumatic brain injuries), and other experiences influence brain development; (5)
determine and replicate factors that influence mental health from childhood to young adulthood; (6)
characterize relationships between mental health and substance use; and (7) specify how use of substances
such as cannabis, alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine affects developmental outcomes, and how neural, cognitive,
emotional, and environmental factors influence the risk for adolescent substance use."

Dental caries, affecting over 3.5 billion people globally, are characterized by tooth demineralization, typically
starting with external enamel and progressing into underlying dentin. If left untreated, caries may result in
excruciating pain and tooth loss. Acid produced from plaque-forming bacteria contributes to demineralization of
the exterior tooth enamel which accelerates after the pH drops below a threshold value (e.g., pH of 5.1- 5.5) at
the enamel surface for extended time periods. Given this, rapid recognition of acid production of biofilms,
especially in hard-to-reach locations such as the pits and fissures of occlusal and interproximal regions, would
allow dentists to locate early-stage tooth decay and therefore assist the dental practitioner in preventing the
development of caries. Although this idea is currently employed via pH meter electrical probes, they are limited
in cost effectiveness, accuracy, speed, resolution, and ability to reach crucial high-risk areas such as between
teeth and within crevices on the biting surfaces of teeth.
To answer the market’s need for improved and rapid early-stage tooth decay detection that may even predict
caries and its severity, VerAvanti is developing an acid-measurement technique that relies on pH-sensitive
fluorescence dye (sodium fluorescein) that rapidly permeates the extracellular matrix of oral biofilms. By
identifying areas on teeth which are more acidic, dentists will be able to identify tooth decay at its earliest possible
stages. Through pre-production development and a pilot human subjects study, VerAvanti intends to put forth
an Optical pH (OpH) device for dental clinics which will be the first medical or dental imaging product to combine
full-color high resolution imaging with exact co-registration pH mapping through the oral cavity at video rates.
This project will include the initial pre-product development of the OpH device, and a first human subjects study
examining clinical utility of caries detection and prediction, ease of use, and integration into dental clinic workflow.
To this end, VerAvanti will first address the actual fabrication of a prototype OpH with pH measurement versatility,
full-color imaging, and initial user interface. Building from this, the quantitative accuracy and reproducibility of
the OpH device after technical calibrations will be tested in vitro, and the device’s efficiency will be assessed
subsequently in a pilot clinical study using up to 12 human subjects. By the end of the project, VerAvanti will
have demonstrated that accurate pH measurements and mappings can be acquired easily and quickly by the
hygienist, as well as be interpreted by dentists in forming site-specific caries management strategies. This project
will establish the feasibility of use of the OpH device in a clinical setting in adults and also propose future
implementation for children."
10909379,"The axonal connections between neurons are essential for their proper function. Disruption of these connections
in insults ranging from spinal cord injury to glaucoma to chemotherapy-induced neuropathy are frequently
debilitating. Whereas intrinsic capacity for axon regeneration offers hope for recovery in the PNS, its failure in
the CNS, along with injury-induced neurodegeneration, frequently results in permanent deficits. Our lab aims to
understand how neurons respond to axon injuries, with the goal of modulating this response for improved axon
regeneration and neuronal survival. In the current proposal, we capitalize on our recent discovery of an
unexpected second branch of the axonal injury response, a pathway that is also implicated in normal memory
formation and in neurodegenerative diseases. Understanding the impact of this pathway, known as the
Integrated Stress Response (ISR), on repair and survival in the tractable models of PNS and CNS axonal injury
may facilitate ISR-based therapies currently being explored for a variety of conditions. Previously, we and others
have demonstrated that both axon regeneration and neurodegeneration depend on a master regulator of the
axonal injury response known as the Dual Leucine-zipper Kinase (DLK). Injury-induced DLK activation leads to
a multifaceted transcriptional response, primarily through the initiation of a well-known MAP kinase (MAPK)
signaling cascade. Unexpectedly, we recently discovered that DLK is also necessary and sufficient to engage
the ISR. How do the MAPK and ISR branches of the DLK response interact to define the differential apoptotic
and regenerative fates of injured neurons in the CNS and PNS? Our ongoing efforts to address this question
have converged on one of the principal downstream effectors of the ISR, the Activating Transcription Factor 4
(ATF4), as a potential regulator of both regeneration and apoptosis. Our preliminary evidence suggests that
ATF4 may differentially impact regenerative potential in the CNS and PNS. In parallel, we have found that
inhibition of the ISR reduces neurodegeneration in a CNS model, though it is not yet known whether this results
from reduced ATF4 or from other aspects of the ISR. To understand the role of ATF4 within the ISR and within
the broader DLK response, we propose to combine in vitro approaches with in vivo CNS and PNS injury models.
First, to understand neuroprotection by ISR inhibition, we will determine the specific contribution of ATF4 to gene
expression changes and neuronal loss in the CNS in vivo. Secondly, we will test the in vivo roles of the ISR and
ATF4 in axon regeneration following peripheral nerve injury and following optic nerve injury, the latter in
combination with manipulations that partially overcome CNS regenerative failure. Thirdly, to discover
mechanisms by which ATF4 regulates axon regeneration, we will test the genetic interactions of ATF4 with its
putative binding partners, upstream mediators, and downstream targets in our established in vitro model. These
studies will expose the roles of the ISR-ATF4 axis of the DLK response in determining axon regeneration and
neurodegeneration, informing the therapeutic potential of these targets in axonopathies and other conditions."

 Flexible decision making, in which individuals adapt their decision strategies, is a hallmark of human
cognition. In particular, humans are able to shift between impulsive (fast, but inaccurate) and deliberative
(accurate, but slow) strategies based on situational demands. Observations that this capacity is disrupted in
neuropsychiatric disorders motivates the study of the neural mechanisms that regulate this type of flexible
decision making. Previous studies suggest that locus-coeruleus norepinephrine (LC-NE) system may play a key
role in flexibly switching between impulsive and deliberative decision making. However, we still lack a precise,
circuit-level understanding of how the NE-LC system alters information processing in downstream targets to
effect decision making.
 To address this gap in knowledge, we propose to utilize a rat model of flexible decision making to identify
how NE-LC alters information processing during flexible decision making. Specifically, we aim to test predictions
of a leading computational model, the adaptive gain theory model, which posits that high NE tone alters the gain
of information processing in neurons of the cerebral cortex leading to impulsive decision making. Our proposal
is separated into three aims. In the first aim, we will use cellular resolution imaging of LC-NE activity and NE
release to determine whether changes in NE signaling correlate with changes in impulsivity as organisms
respond to environmental demands. In the second aim, we will manipulate the activity of NE neurons in the LC
using chemogenics and evaluate whether artificial activation and silencing of LC-NE system is sufficient to drive
changes in impulsivity. In the third aim, we will use simultaneous imaging of neuronal dynamics and NE release
to determine whether NE tone predicts the strength of cortical responses to decision-related sensory inputs. If
successful, this project will achieve a circuit-level understanding of how NE signaling regulates flexible discission
making. This improved understanding will provide a critical advance in identifying the neural mechanism of
decision making and will provide a foundation for understanding how these mechanisms may be affected in
neuropsychiatric disorders."
10818485,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Positive affective reactions (i.e., ‘liking’) to pleasant life events are crucial to healthy psychological
function and well-being. Conversely, pathological hedonic dysfunction in ‘liking’ circuitry can cause
loss of positive affect (anhedonia), and excessive negative affect (dysphoria). These affective
dysfunctions have devastating consequences in mood disorders, such as major depression, bipolar
disorder, schizophrenia, etc.
It is therefore crucial to understand how normal brain affective mechanisms generate positive ‘liking’
reactions, and how dysfunction in brain ‘liking’ circuitry causes intense negative dysphoric affective
reactions, in order to develop better treatment for mood disorders. This proposal aims to make progress
towards those goals. Our previous studies identified a network of specialized brain mechanisms, or
pleasure-amplifying hedonic hotspots, that generate intense ‘liking’ reactions. These pleasure-intensifying
hedonic hotspots are small specialized subregions contained within limbic orbitofrontal cortex, insula,
nucleus accumbens and ventral pallidum, where optogenetic or neurochemical neural stimulations are
able to enhance ‘liking’ reactions. Our previous studies also identified dysfunction in hedonic hotspots
that produced excessive negative affect.
Yet the specific hedonic coding mechanisms within each brain hedonic hotspot that cause ‘liking’ still
remain unclear. Also unknown is how the hedonic hotspots functionally work together, to form a larger
and integrated hedonic brain circuit. Finally, it is unknown how particular neural dysfunctions in hedonic
hotspots cause intense negative ‘fear’ or ‘disgust’ reactions, or whether such excessive negative affect can
be successfully reversed. The studies proposed here will use sophisticated optogenetic and affective
neuroscience techniques to answer these questions. The results will provide insights into brain hedonic
circuitry, which in turn can provide a better scientific basis to guide development of future therapies for
anhedonia, anxiety and dysphoria disorders."

Sensory Deprivation profoundly impacts cortical circuits which in turn impact organismal
functioning from mouse to man. Traditionally research has focused on how neurons respond to
changes in sensory experience during development. Recently attention has been drawn to non-
neuronal elements such as microglia and the perineuronal net (neuron specific form of the
extracellular matrix). Microglia, the brains immune cells, alter their morphology in response to
whisker trimming evoked sensory deprivation, their somata enlarge and their process retract,
hallmarks of their activated state. Coincident with this, the perineuronal net is reduced
preferentially around parvalbumin positive GABAergic interneurons. Physiological studies have
shown that these neurons play a key role in regulating cortical excitability and following
perineuronal net digestion we found their intrinsic physiological properties become altered
(lower probability of spiking, lower input resistance). Our overarching hypothesis is that sensory
deprivation activates microglia which in turn shape the perineuronal net. We will investigate this
causal relationship by depleting microglia while trimming the animal’s whiskers and evaluating
the perineuronal net. The functional consequences of this relationship will be studied using
whole-cell patch clamp recordings in the thalamocortical slice and finally the behavioral
ramifications will be assayed using a texture based novel object paradigm."

 Sarcoidosis is a poorly characterized immune disorder that has often been called the “Great Imitator”
due to its similarity to a variety of other diseases and the difficulty of diagnosis. The disease causes
aggregates of immune cells called granulomas to form in various tissues, causing organ damage and eventual
death in severe cases. Sarcoidosis etiology remains largely unknown, with no clear trigger and symptoms that
can disappear on their own or worsen despite treatment. Current research has uncovered associations with
some common bacterial species as well as immune dysregulation, especially in the T helper 1, T helper 17,
and T regulatory cell populations. However, progress in the field has been hampered in part by the complexity
of the disease and limitations in current models.
 We hypothesize that distinct subpopulations of T cells drive immune dysregulation and progression in
sarcoidosis. We further hypothesize that this dysregulation differentiates sarcoidosis from other granulomatous
processes and provides a basis for disease specific modeling and drug discovery.
 Aim 1 will apply recently developed single-cell level sequencing techniques to better elucidate the
complex network of gene and cell interactions involved in pathogenesis. Samples of sarcoidosis patient
granulomas and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will be analyzed via single-cell RNA sequencing.
Their transcriptomes will be compared to the PBMCs of control subjects as well as control granulomas formed
by stimulation of control PBMCs with purified protein derivative. Cells will be identified by their gene expression
profiles, then assessed for differences in gene expression and regulation in sarcoidosis compared to controls.
We will use this data to develop a transcriptomic atlas of cell types and regulatory networks in sarcoidosis.
 Aim 2 will use this atlas to evaluate in vitro sarcoidosis models which successfully utilized patient
samples to elucidate differences between disease and controls. Granulomas created using each model will be
analyzed via single-cell RNA-seq and compared to our sarcoidosis transcriptomic atlas. This approach fosters
detailed evaluation of the sarcoidosis immune environment and the evaluation of the capability of existing
sarcoidosis models to mimic sarcoidosis.
 This project integrates recent advances in sequencing and bioinformatics to uncover mechanisms
involved in sarcoidosis. The single-cell transcriptomic atlas of sarcoidosis granulomas and PBMCs will
interrogate cellular interactions that regulate immune dysfunction in sarcoidosis, providing new points of focus
for further mechanistic research. Our analysis of sarcoidosis models will guide further model design, and
design of high throughput biomarker and drug screens for sarcoidosis. This project has the potential to improve
the specificity and efficacy of treatment, as well as the ease of diagnosis. The multidisciplinary research also
lays the groundwork for my training as a physician scientist while exploring a key clinical question."

Rare diseases are defined as those diseases affecting less than 1 in 5000 patients in the US. Although singularly
rare, combined there are over 7000 rare disease that affect approximately 1 in every 10 Americans. For these
patients, it is often difficult to find or build patient support networks or gain access to the latest research on their
particular rare disease. The team in the Sanford Research's Coordination of Rare Diseases at Sanford (CoRDS)
registry program has a nine-year history of hosting an annual rare disease symposium for medical professions,
scientists, rare disease patients, and patient advocates. This event, which started as a grassroots effort, serves
as a collaborative research summit drawing attendees from across the Great Plain states. With this proposal,
our goal is to grow this once one-day event into a multi-day Great Plains Rare Disease Summit that will provide
access to the highest standard of scientific and clinical research in a format that is accessible to patients,
advocates and community members. Incorporating this mix of attendees encourages communication between
the research and patient communities. Investigators will come away from the meeting having heard the patient's
story and have a better understanding of how the disease impacts the person. Likewise, patients and advocates
will come away with a better scientific understanding of their condition and can go back to their communities as
more effective and energized advocates for rare disease research and awareness. Although rare disease events
are held across the US, none are held consistently in the Great Plains region. For families and patient advocacy
groups with high medical costs and health barriers, attending these events can be cost prohibitive or logistically
challenging. By bringing the conference to the region in which they live, we are providing a much needed,
mutually beneficial connection to the research world.
Our objective is to establish the Great Plains Rare Disease Summit as a destination conference for scientists,
medical professionals, patients, advocates, and industry throughout the US. Each year, the conference will
promote groundbreaking research in rare diseases and provide an important avenue for conversation between
scientists, clinicians, and those affected by the diseases they study and treat. We will achieve these objectives
by 1) providing rural rare disease patients, caregivers and advocates access to a high quality rare disease
education and support; 2) providing a forum for experts to present cutting edge research; 3) building up the rare
disease community in the region for patients, caregivers, and advocates; and 4) developing an innovative new
program that promotes rare disease education and research in the Great Plains."
10819204,"Recent studies have established MED1 (Mediator Subunit 1, also named TRAP220, DRIP205, or
MED220) as a key transcriptional coactivator for ERα in breast cancer. Significantly, the MED1 gene is
located at the chromosome 17q12 region, also known as the HER2 amplicon, and co-amplifies with HER2 in
nearly all instances in breast cancer. We have further confirmed MED1 overexpression and correlation with
HER2 status at the protein level using human breast cancer tissue microarrays. Importantly, we found that
MED1 serves as a crosstalk point for the HER2 and ERα pathways in ERα-mediated transcription. During our
last funding period, we have established MED1 as a key mediator of HER2-driven tumorigenesis using our
newly generated MED1 mutant knockin and MED1 overexpression mouse models. Here, we have provided
further preliminary data supporting Jab1 as a key MED1 direct downstream target gene by unbiased RNA-seq
analyses and further experimental validations. Interestingly, we found that Jab1 can also in turn regulate MED1
stability and is required for ER-dependent gene transcription and functions. The overall objective of this
application is to elucidate the role and underlying molecular mechanism of Jab1/MED1 axis in HER2-mediated
breast cancer. Our hypothesis is that the crosstalk between Jab1 and MED1 plays key roles in HER2-mediated
breast cancer metastasis and treatment resistance. We have provided strong preliminary data, generated
essential reagents, and assembled an outstanding team of collaborators to pursue the following specific aims:
1) elucidate the role and molecular mechanisms underlying Jab1 functions and regulations in breast cancer
metastasis, 2) determine the role of MED1 turnover and its regulation by Jab1 in breast cancer metastasis, and
3) test the efficacy of targeting Jab1 and MED1 on breast cancer metastasis and treatment resistance.
Through these studies, we expect to make an important positive impact not only by filling key knowledge gaps
on the role of previously uncharacterized Jab1/MED1 regulatory loop in HER2+/ER+ breast cancer, but also by
providing potential novel strategies for the future treatment of this difficult to treat subtype of breast cancer."

Notch1 signaling is an important mediator of stem cell self-renewal and therapeutic resistance, and the most
prevalent oncogene (~60%) in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) - an aggressive neoplasm of T cell
progenitors that affects both children and adults. Although current intensive chemotherapies can suppress the
disease, they come at the cost of serious side effects and are insufficient to eliminate Notch1-driven leukemic
cells. One in five children and one in two adults with T-ALL do not survive due to either unresponsive or
relapsed disease. Efforts to target oncogenic Notch1 with small-molecule inhibitors have been hampered by
their inherent cytotoxicity. Overcoming these difficulties will require improved understanding of the oncogenic
mechanisms controlled by Notch1 and a better appreciation of the genes and pathways that regulate Notch1-
driven leukemogenesis as potential targets of T-ALL therapy. Through Drosophila studies and the generation
of mouse models for T-ALL, we have discovered that, T-ALL-associated Notch could be degraded by an
unconventional endo-lysosomal module through a physical interaction with the autophagic tumor suppressor
UVRAG, which reshapes Notch activity and resultant Notch-dependent cellular response. Thus, the central
hypothesis of this proposal is that the endo-lysosomal titration of Notch activity by UVRAG represents a unique
mechanism governing Notch1 before proteolytic processing, and that disruption of this regulatory module
impacts T-cell homeostasis and contributes to T-ALL. Specifically, we propose experiments to
comprehensively dissect the molecular mechanism of UVRAG-mediated endo-lysosomal inhibition of Notch1 in
T-ALL. Furthermore, we will elucidate the unequivocal impact of this mechanism on the self-renewal and
stemness of leukemia-initiating cell function in human T-ALL primary samples. Finally, we will use the mouse
models to test the concept that boosting this mechanism could restore Notch homeostasis and achieve
sustained T-ALL remission. These aims will be addressed using multidisciplinary innovative approaches that
integrate state-of-the-art genetic, biochemistry, high-resolution imaging, and physiological assays in cells and
transgenic mouse models. We now bring within this proposal a collaboration of world-wide leaders in T-ALL
pathology and molecular biology along with clinicians and pathologists. Our use of patient-derived T-ALL
samples will maximize the relevance of our findings for eventual translation to T-ALL patients in the clinic.
Overall, this project will lead to an in-depth understanding of Notch1-driven leukemogenesis, and provides a
critical trajectory for the development of optimal anti-leukemia strategies against this aggressive lymphoid
malignancy."

According to the National Eye Institute, there are currently over 12 million Americans suffering
from diseases affecting the retina. To present, therapeutic attempts to reduce retinal death or
replace lost neurons have been met with limited success, highlighting the need for an alternative
approach to this problem. The zebrafish is becoming an increasingly popular model to study
mechanisms of stem-cell based tissue regeneration. In response to extensive retinal injury,
zebrafish are able to completely regenerate the retina. This is accomplished through the induction
of Müller glial cells which undergo an asymmetric division to generate a pool of progenitor cells
that go on to regenerate all cell types of the retina with no evidence of the glial scarring observed
in mammalian species. While the remarkable capacity of the zebrafish to regenerate tissues has
been known for years, our understanding of the comparative biology between mammalian and
teleost responses to retinal damage remains poorly understood. To present, studies of retinal
regeneration in the zebrafish have largely focused on identifying signaling pathways and
individual genes involved in retinal regeneration. The epigenetic orchestration of these pathways,
however, remains to be investigated in the zebrafish. DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts) have been
studied extensively in mammals and have been identified as critical in the homeostatic
maintenance of adult stem cell processes such as hematopoietic stem cell development. The
limited literature of epigenetic regulators in zebrafish reveals that teleost species appear to utilize
the same mechanisms of epigenetic regulation as mammalian species, with zebrafish Dnmts
baring considerable sequence homology to mammalian Dnmts. It is known that immediately
following retinal injury in the zebrafish there is an initial global DNA hypomethylation and
subsequent increase in DNA methylation as the pools of progenitor cells begin to differentiate,
indicating the importance of the epigenetic landscape during these processes. With the
experiments planned in this proposal, we aim to identify the role of Dnmts in orchestrating the
process of adult retinal regeneration in the zebrafish, with the goal of elucidating pathways
regulated in Müller glial derived progenitor cells at the epigenetic level. We also plan to develop
a new tool that will be an important addition to the zebrafish community for investigation of the
consequences of targeted epigenetic modulation of specific genes. These proposed studies will
illuminate candidate genes for targeted therapeutic approaches to identify and “unlock” pathways
in mammalian systems that are epigenetically silenced, opening new avenues for future studies
in the field of regenerative medicine."

Genetics
Project Summary
Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive, disabling neurological disorder. Studies
investigating the features of the disease in Black populations are uncommon, with some
suggesting that Blacks with PD are more disabled, with greater disease severity, and
with different clinical features compared to White PD patients. These health disparities
are likely to influence the quality of care for AA with PD. The specific aims of this study
are to investigate 1) PD symptoms and signs in Black participants, 2) the management
of PD in these participants, and 3) to determine genotype-phenotype relationships.
Based on prior studies, the main study hypotheses are that Blacks with PD have more
severe motor features, greater impact on their quality of life, less therapeutic options,
and dissimilar genetic variation compared to Whites with PD. Aim 1 investigates motor,
non-motor, and quality of life scales in 400 Black and 200 White participants recruited at
seven different US sites. Aim 2 investigates management in the same participants
including medication, non-medication and surgical treatments. As part of this Aim,
clinical guidelines will be developed for PD treating clinicians to raise awareness of racial
disparities in PD. In collaboration with PD foundations, educational programming will be
developed for the Black PD community to improve self-management skills and reduce
disparities. In Aim 3, a collaboration with the Global Parkinson’s Genetics Program will
be utilized to determine genotype-phenotype relationships in the Black participants. The
overall goal of this study is to investigate racial disparities in Blacks with PD by studying
key components of the disease and then disseminate the findings to the neurologic and
patient community with targeted education and guidance. This study will result in new
scientific knowledge with in-depth characterization of racial disparities in PD, and will
change clinical practice by raising awareness of differences in the PD clinical phenotype,
patient-reported outcomes, and PD recognition and management. The results will also
impact public health since recognition of differences in disease manifestations and
management in Black patients will improve healthcare delivery and quality of care in this
underserved and understudied population."

Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease, also known as hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (HMSN), is the
most common form of inherited peripheral neuropathy, with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 2500 people,
equating to approximately 125,000 people in the United States. CMT affects peripheral nerves in a length-
dependent manner and is characterized by weakness and wasting of the distal limb muscles leading to
progressive motor impairment, sensory loss, and skeletal deformities. No therapy is available for CMT patients.
The largest gene family implicated in CMT encodes aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs), which are essential
enzymes that catalyze the first reaction in protein biosynthesis, namely, the charging of transfer RNAs (tRNAs)
with their cognate amino acids. However, understanding the connection between CMT and aaRSs is a challenge.
Because aaRSs are essential players in protein synthesis, it is believed that the CMT-causing mutations in tRNA
synthetases must affect protein synthesis in some way. Curiously, CMT-causing mutations do not necessarily
affect the aminoacylation function of the enzyme; and almost all tRNA synthetase mutations that are CMT-
associated have autosomal dominant inheritance, suggesting a gain-of-function disease mechanism. Lastly, as
protein synthesis is essential for all tissue types, the extreme tissue specificity associated with the CMT
phenotypes has complicated the biological understanding of the role of aaRSs in CMT disease. Intriguingly,
cytosolic aaRSs are also detected in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. While the initial hypothesis was that aaRSs
function here in proofreading newly-synthesized tRNAs, later findings suggest that the nuclear-localized aaRSs
are involved in regulating a wide range of biological processes including vascular development, inflammation,
and stress responses mainly due to their distinctive abilities to interact with the transcriptional machinery.
However, the biological function of nuclear TyrRS has never been investigated in vivo in a mammalian system.
The goal of this project is to explore the physiological functions of aaRSs in the nucleus and their relationship to
CMT. Our main focus is on TyrRS, because of the established reagents and knowledge necessary for exploration
in a mammalian system and because of the recent evidence from a Drosophila model for the involvement of
nuclear TyrRS in CMT. Although the main focus is on TyrRS, we will probe commonality with other subtypes of
peripheral neuropathy as well as other neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s
disease, Huntington’s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This is because the nuclear function of TyrRS
is likely to be generally related to oxidative stress and to other important pathways and gene regulators that are
relevant to the neurodegenerative process independent of CMT mutations."

The canonical functions attributed to telomeres in textbooks are to protect chromosome ends
from degradation and fusion, both of which are confirmed drivers of genome instability and
tumorigenesis. We have discovered two new and unforeseen roles for telomeres that are crucial
for safeguarding the genome.
First, we found that by interacting during meiotic prophase with the LINC complex (linker of
nucleo- and cyto-skeleton), which spans the nuclear envelope, telomeres promote the nuclear
envelope breakdown needed for spindle formation and the meiotic nuclear divisions.
Remarkably, centromeres perform this function analogously in mitotic cell cycles, and indeed
sporadic contacts between centromeres and LINC during meiotic prophase can rescue the loss
of telomere-LINC contacts, indicating a surprising instance of telomere-centromere
interchangeability. What features of telomeres and centromeres endow them with the capacity
to control nuclear envelope breakdown and therefore cell cycle progression? Here we propose a
series of experiments to answer this question.
Second, we found that by providing a nuclear microdomain conducive to centromere assembly,
telomeres rescue a surprising tendency of centromeres to become dismantled upon meiotic
onset by the very factors (the meiotic endonuclease Spo11 and the meiosis-specific cohesin
Rec8) that define meiosis. Indeed, we found that expression of Spo11 or Rec8 (which are
normally meiosis-specific) in proliferating cells induces centromere dismantlement and
chromosome missegregation. Here we propose to determine the mechanisms of Spo11- and
Rec8-mediated centromere dismantlement, how telomeres promote the reassembly of
dismantled centromeres, and whether these observations are relevant to the growing list of
human cancers that mis-express meiotic proteins.
These studies will open up new frontiers by defining at the molecular level unanticipated
features of two key lynchpins of chromosome stability, telomeres and centromeres."

to ART. We have used novel technology-based adherence measures of ART developed in the past two decades,
including the cutting-edge ingestible sensor (IS) technology to obtain non-inferred, real-time adherence
monitoring by Proteus® Digital Health Feedback (PDHF) system. Despite its validation reported in our recent
publications, the PDHF system has been limited by the lack of incorporation of SBDOH. For many years, a major
focus in HIV clinics has been to have multidisciplinary teams of nurses, social workers, and case managers to
address SBDOH; however, timing of interventions are often weeks to months after such problems have been
identified. This study will develop and test an integrated intervention that combines IS technology and adverse
SBDOH alerts to maximize adherence and viral suppression. Using real-time IS monitoring, our integrated
intervention will be able to immediately trigger the existing multidisciplinary team at clinic to address SBDOH
issues as soon as predefined patterns of poor adherence are observed. A cohort of 110 adult patients who have
or are at high risk for sub-optimal adherence will be recruited from a LA County safety net HIV clinic, located in
a geographic HIV hotspot, dealing many adverse SBDOH issues. Participants will be randomized into the
intervention or usual care. The integrated intervention will run for 20 weeks, followed by a 10-week period to
assess sustainability. The primary end points include acceptability of the integrated intervention, frequency and
timeliness of SBDOH interventions, level of challenges of SBDOH in HIV treatment, and adherence to ART. The
secondary end points include viral load, high-risk sexual activity defined by self-report, and detection of sexually
transmitted infections. The overarching goals are to evaluate (i) acceptability of the integrated intervention,
frequency and timeliness of SBDOH intervention, and level of challenges of SBDOH in HIV treatment; (ii) the
efficacy of the integrated intervention for monitoring, facilitating, and improving adherence to ART; and (iii) the
efficacy of the integrated intervention for improving virologic outcome and reducing high-risk sexual activity.

 Recent studies suggest that in the U.S. prostate cancer is over-detected and over-treated resulting in
significant morbidity and financial costs. These problems are the product of poor sensitivity and specificity
serum Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) as a screening tool, leading to unnecessary biopsies that find small and
predominantly indolent prostate tumors. While many prostate cancers should be managed with active
surveillance, uncertainties surrounding available clinical tools of aggressiveness (such as PSA, Gleason score
and clinical stage) will often drive patients and physicians to treatment. Attempts to improve prognostication
using candidate biomarkers, mostly discovered from genomic analyses of large pieces of cancers, have had
few successes, and available molecular tools provide only modest prediction, at best.
An alternative to the genomic driver focus is that a combination of molecular events, under the influence of
the tumor microenvironment, drive tumor’s molecular evolution and progression. Consequently, analysis of
tumor characteristics detectable in pathomic data, such as heterogeneity of expression subtypes, amount of
stroma, extent of microenvironmental heterogeneity, extent of immune infiltration, or extent of hypoxia, may
ultimately lead to better patient stratification. Our proposal fundamentally centers around the most critical
clinical question in early prostate cancer that is the basis for clinical decision making: Can we identify
proteomic, imaging, and/or microenvironment features that distinguish those aggressive cancers that
will progress to cause harm from benign cancers that can be safely monitored by watchful waiting?
 To examine the links between the heterogeneity of early, screen-detected prostate cancers and likelihood of
progression, we will interrogate a retrospective set of 225 prostatectomy patients. In Aim 1, we will use GE’s
hyperplexed immune-pathology platform (Cell DIVE) to profile over 50 proteins at the cellular and subcellular
level along with matrix components that define the microenvironments with the cells present in this matrix. In
Aim 2, we will focus on single-cell level data and systematically extract the prevalence of the diverse cell
subtypes found within these tumors. Cells will be typed along traditional axes (e.g. epithelial, CD4+ T-cells). In
addition, we will use molecular and structural characteristics to define novel subtypes. Features associated
with cell types (e.g. existence, prevalence, diversity) will be used alone and in combination with Gleason
grading to distinguish patients with aggressive tumors that are likely to progress. Aim 3 will focus on
neighborhood and regional analyses, particularly on developing approaches to extract tumor
microenvironmental characteristics that have demonstrated linkages to progression (hypoxia, stromal
reactivity, immune cell patterning). Using a diverse set of these features, alongside deep learning techniques
on primary images, we will develop classifiers distinguishing aggressive and benign tumors. Finally, in Aim 4
we will validate classifiers in large cohorts."
10877163,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Flaviviruses are single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses that include dangerous human pathogens like
dengue, West Nile, Yellow Fever, Zika, and many others. During infection, these viruses produce a set of non-
coding RNAs called ‘subgenomic flavivirus RNAs’ (sfRNAs) that interact with cellular proteins to manipulate the
cellular environment, to include inhibiting the antiviral response. sfRNAs have been directly linked to cytopathic
and pathogenic outcomes, and viruses that cannot produce sfRNAs are attenuated, motivating efforts to
understand the mechanism of xrRNA production. sfRNAs are made when cellular 5’à3’ exoribonucleases (in
particular, Xrn1) processively degrade the viral genomic RNA but then halt at specifically structured RNA
elements in the viral 3’ UTR called exoribonuclease resistant RNAs (xrRNAs). By solving the structures of
multiple xrRNAs by x-ray crystallography and combining this with biochemistry, biophysics, and virology, we
showed that xrRNAs fold into a unique ring-like topology that creates a mechanical block the exoribonuclease
cannot pass through. Furthermore, we used our discoveries to classify xrRNAs and to find new examples
associated with both non-coding and coding RNAs. These successes now define several new questions. First,
xrRNAs are often found in multiple copies ‘in tandem’ where their function is coupled in some way, but the
structural basis of this coupling, and the effects of breaking the coupling on both sfRNA formation and viral
infection kinetics, are unknown. Second, although we have a good understanding of several classes of xrRNAs,
we have yet to solve the structure of an xrRNA from a tick-borne flavivirus, which appear to have interesting and
unique properties. Third, although we have found many new examples of xrRNAs, it appears there are many
more that are undiscovered, and we also do not understand how the various classes of xrRNA relate
evolutionarily. How do these structures diversify and evolve in 3-D given the tight constraints on their folding?
Here, we propose to answer these questions in three aims, employing a strategy that combines biochemistry, x-
ray crystallography, cryo-EM, virology, and in vitro selections coupled with computational tools. The research
described here will contribute significant basic knowledge regarding an important molecular process of broad
applicability to viral disease, a necessary step between the discovery of a mechanism and the targeting of it for
therapeutic intervention."
10814771,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
 Over 90% of adult males develop lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) secondary to bladder outlet obstruction
by age 80, rendering benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) the most common proliferative abnormality in humans.
LUTS secondary to BPH negatively impact the quality of life of 210 million men globally, accounting for significant
life years lost. In this study we propose to clinically evaluate the mechanisms of resistance to 5α-reductase
inhibitor, finasteride, one of the more common drugs used to manage BPH and associated LUTS.
 Ongoing work in our lab has focused on steroid 5α-reductase 2 (SRD5A2, aka: 5α-reductase 2 [5AR2]), the
enzyme responsible for prostatic development and growth. Our investigations have revealed that expression of
SRD5A2 is variable, and in fact, 30% of men do not express SRD5A2 in prostate tissues. In previous work, we
showed that somatic suppression of SRD5A2 during adulthood is dependent on epigenetic changes
associated with methylation of the promoter region of the SRD5A2 gene. Our studies indicate that (1)
methylation of the SRDA2 is regulated by direct binding of the DNA-methyl transferase 1 (DNMT1) protein to
the SRD5A2 promoter; (2) the inflammatory mediators TNF-α, NF-kB, and IL-6 regulate DNMT1 binding and
subsequent methylation of the SRD5A2 promoter region; (3) clinical conditions associated with increased
inflammation, age, and obesity, are associated with decreased expression of SRD5A via epigenetic
modification; (4) in the absence of prostatic SRD5A2, where androgenic pathways are blocked, alternate
estrogenic pathways are upregulated, leading to an androgenic-to-estrogenic switch in the prostate gland, thus
creating alternate pathways for prostatic growth. Therefore, we hypothesize that absence of SRD5A2 as a
result of somatic methylation is directly responsible for lack of sensitivity to 5ARI therapy in men with
BPH. To demonstrate the clinical significance of epigenetic changes to SRD5A2 and confirm its role in
regulating sensitivity to 5ARI treatment, we propose the following aims: Specific Aim 1: To assess the role of
5-AR2 expression in the development of resistance to 5-ARI therapy. Specific Aim 2: To demonstrate that
SRD5A2 methylation turns on estrogen pathways and affects sensitivity to 5ARI therapies in men with BPH.
Specific Aim 3: To determine that prostatic inflammation is associated with methylation of SRD5A2 promoter.
Our findings have broad implications for the development of predictive biomarker assays that can be used to
evaluate resistance to BPH-related therapies and allow clinicians to select alternate therapies for managing the
most common proliferative disorder affecting men worldwide."

The opioid crisis has escalated dramatically among women: from 1999 to 2019, the rate of opioid-related
overdoses among females increased from 1.4 to 9.3 per 100,000 population. Women face many unique
challenges in obtaining treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD). These barriers include caretaking
responsibilities and child custody concerns. Additionally, through a phenomenon known as “telescoping,”
women have a shorter duration of opioid use before meeting the clinical criteria for OUD compared to men.
Further complicating the treatment landscape for women with OUD is that they often present for treatment with
more severe comorbidities than men do. These gendered differences highlight the importance of women-
centered strategies for engagement in care, a critical step in the OUD Cascade of Care. To address these
gendered needs and barriers to care, a novel women-centered recovery navigation system is proposed.
Patient navigator programs are an evidence-based intervention that address disparities and destigmatize
seeking care for vulnerable populations. While available for a range of chronic health issues, they have not
been widely implemented or evaluated for women with OUD. Ultimately, the proposed recovery navigation
system will combine a web-based platform with personalized, women-centered recovery navigator services,
and will use a hybrid approach that connects women to both virtual and in-person services. This recovery
navigation system will serve as a gateway to services that meet women’s unique needs through increasing
awareness of service and resource availability, as well as normalizing and destigmatizing seeking treatment for
OUD among women. Women in recovery from OUD will guide development through a structured community-
engaged intervention development framework. The objectives of this project are to advance understanding of
barriers to engagement in care for women with OUD and to create a women-centered recovery navigation
system. These objectives will be achieved through the following specific aims: 1) identify key barriers to
engagement in care for women with OUD, as well as potential solutions; 2) develop and evaluate a pilot
women-centered recovery navigator program; and 3) develop and evaluate a web-based recovery platform to
engage women with OUD in care. Analyses will be completed using both qualitative and quantitative methods.
Upon completion of the proposed 5-year project and under the guidance of my mentorship team, I will advance
my expertise in (1) community-engaged research strategies, (2) the theory and neurobiology of opioid
dependence among women, and (3) intervention design. I will also have the data necessary to scale up and
refine this women-centered recovery navigation system, and will submit an R01 application to do so by the
beginning of year 5 of the award period. Taken together, I will be in a position to establish myself as an
independent investigator focused on developing and adapting evidence-based, women-centered interventions
that tangibly improve the health outcomes of women struggling with OUD and addiction across the life course."

With support from my primary mentor Dr. Borba, my co-mentors Drs. Freier, Dorsey, and Gelaye, and my
collaborator Dr. Bird, I propose a comprehensive interdisciplinary research and training plan focused on
developing my expertise in clinical intervention research and qualitative assessment of cross cultural
adaptations of mental health treatments for people who have migrated due to forced displacement. The
proposed study investigates the potential avenues of treatment for mental health disorders that arise due to
forced displacement in people from Venezuela who have migrated to Peru. My research program goal is to be
an independent researcher and examine mental health treatment for the purpose of understanding treatment
seeking and retention for mental disorders in stigmatized and marginalized populations, such as forcibly
displaced peoples. Preliminary findings from Venezuelans who have migrated into Peru due to the recent
Venezuelan exodus suggest that there are risk factors for mental health particular to the migration journey
context. Thus, this proposal utilizes qualitative methods to examine, and subsequently target, context specific
migration factors that facilitate treatment seeking and retention for forcibly displaced populations in Peru with
mental disorders. Framed within implementation science this proposal will include in person interviews with
people who have been forcibly displaced from Venezuela and migrated into Peru. These interviews will be
leveraged to adapt the Common Elements Treatment Approach, a transdiagnostic intervention, for the unique
challenges of forced displacement. In collaboration with my mentors, I have developed a comprehensive
training plan that will prepare me with the requisite skill set for a research career in global mental health. My
training and career development goals are to cultivate skills in: (1) qualitative methods, (2) cross cultural
adaptations of mental health treatments, and (3) analysis of clinical interventions. These skills will allow me to
become an independent scientist focused on global mental health."

 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the clinical manifestation of a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by
pervasive and progressive cognitive decline with impairment in activities of daily living. According to the
Centers for Disease Control the number of Americans with Alzheimer’s disease or dementia will grow to 13.9
million (2018 report) by 2060, making it an urgent public concern. Research in the last decade has focused on
early identification of the disease and revealed a prodromal phase prior to the onset of functional impairments,
known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Despite early identification, there are few treatment options to slow
down progression from MCI to AD. Recent studies suggest that cognitive deficits may arise from abnormal
synchronization of distributed neural networks.
 Synchronization or synchronous firing of neurons, binds cortical areas into functional networks in a task
and state-dependent manner. Specifically, neural synchrony in the gamma band (30-45Hz) plays a central role
in top-down attention, multisensory processing, perceptual binding and working memory (WM) in healthy
individuals. Gamma band responses (GBR) are impaired in individuals with AD spectrum disorders, and animal
studies in AD models targeting GBR have shown positive effects on cognition. Thus, developing similar
treatments targeting GBR are expected to improve cognition in individuals with MCI. Our group has
administered EEG-neurofeedback (EEG-NFB) targeting GBR in SCZ patients, with promising early results
(research strategy). NFB is a low-cost, safe, easily administered closed-loop neuromodulation technique where
subjects are shown their brain activity as a visual metaphor and asked to modulate it in a given direction. EEG-
NFB has been employed in multiple disorders ranging from ADHD, depression, to anxiety and in multiple
populations including children and older adults. Based on these encouraging results, we are proposing a study
to 1) test the efficacy of EEG-NFB targeting GBR in individuals with amnestic MCI compared to a
sham/placebo, 2) explore the mechanism underlying change in cognition and 3) explore pre-treatment
characteristics that predict treatment response."
10815690,"Project Summary/Abstract
Cardiac cell death by apoptosis and/or necrosis is a hallmark of cardiac ischemic injury, pathological remodeling,
and end-stage heart failure. In contrast to apoptosis, the role of necrosis in the pathogenesis of heart disease
has been largely understudied. Emerging evidence has identified several forms of “programmed necrosis”, such
as death receptor-mediated necrosis (termed “necroptosis”), mitochondria-mediated necrosis, and oxidative
stress-induced necrosis. How programmed necrosis is regulated in the heart remains largely unknown, and
preventing necrosis is still an important challenge. Moreover, currently no molecular strategies are available to
simultaneously target multiple cell death processes in heart disease. Here, our preliminary studies identified an
unexpected role for CYLD (cylindromatosis), a lysine 63 (K63)-specific deubiquitinase, as a key regulator of
multiple cell death pathways in cardiomyocytes, including apoptosis, necroptosis, and oxidative stress-induced
necrosis. Intriguingly, CYLD expression was markedly upregulated in the heart following ischemic injury. Using
Cyld knockout and transgenic mouse models, our preliminary data further show that ablation of CYLD
attenuated, whereas overexpression of CYLD exacerbated, cardiac ischemic injury. Importantly, ablation of
CYLD inhibited apoptosis, necroptosis, and necrosis in cardiomyocytes, whereas overexpression of CYLD
showed the opposite effect. Mechanistically, our data reveal a K63-linked polyubiquitination (K63-Ub) dependent
cell death signaling mechanism whereby CYLD controls the ubiquitination status and activity of three cell death
regulators: TRAF2, TAK1 and AKT/PKB. Therefore, we hypothesize the deubiquitinase CYLD is a key regulator
of multiple cell death pathways and a promising therapeutic target for cardiac ischemic injury and remodeling.
Using genetic loss- and gain-of-function strategies, we will address two specific aims: Aim 1) To investigate the
novel role of CYLD as a key regulator of myocardial cell death, ischemic injury, and remodeling using Cyld
knockout and transgenic models and AAV9-shCYLD vectors. Aim 2) To define a CYLD-mediated, K63-Ub
dependent cell death signaling network regulating apoptosis, necroptosis, and necrosis in cardiomyocytes. This
project investigates a novel CYLD-mediated cell death signaling network in the heart and its functional relevance
in cardiac ischemic injury and remodeling. Moreover, the proposed studies will define a K63-Ub dependent
mechanism regulating apoptosis, necroptosis, and necrosis, which constitutes a new paradigm of cell death
regulation. These studies also have important translational implications by providing new anti-cell death
strategies, given our preliminary results revealing CYLD as a molecular target for multiple cell death processes."
10815696,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT:
Background: There are currently more than five million Americans living with Alzheimer’s disease and related
dementias, a number expected to increase to nearly 14 million by 2050. Among the most common symptoms of
persons living with dementia (PLWD) are behavioral and psychological disturbances. PLWD require care
partners who themselves face challenges including guilt, depression, and emotional and physical stress due to
the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). Guidelines by the American Geriatrics Society
currently discourage antipsychotic prescriptions to treat BPSD, instead encouraging non-pharmacological
approaches. While some non-pharmacologic strategies for addressing BPSD have shown to be effective,
adherence is challenging. Novel concepts from behavioral economics (BE), a field that combines insights from
economics and psychology to recognize that humans often make predictable decision errors, has shown promise
in promoting appropriate disease management in a variety of healthcare settings. Mobile health (mHealth)
technology is one mechanism for delivering non-pharmacologic care; however, no strategies to date have
incorporated BE principles to improve adherence to non-pharmacologic strategies for managing BPSD.
Research: This study will leverage the power of BE with mHealth to develop, user-test, and pilot a digital health
tool aimed at improving adherence to non-pharmacologic strategies for BPSD. A thorough review of the
literature, stakeholder interviews, and a design-thinking workshop will aid in the development of the BE nudges.
Visits with PLWD-care partner dyads and semi-structured telephone interviews will be conducted to user-test
and refine the BE-mHealth digital tool prototype. The culmination of this work will be an intervention ready for
testing via a single-arm, 6-month pilot study within the New York University Langone Health (NYULH) system.
The primary study outcome will be adherence to the non-pharmacologic strategies, and secondary outcomes
will include changes in BPSD, care partner burden, and prescriptions for anti-psychotic medications. Socio-
demographic, clinical, and primary/secondary study outcomes will be measured using care partner reported
outcomes and patient electronic health records embedded within the BE-mHealth tool for ease of data capture.
Training: The candidate’s proposed training plan builds upon prior research in the design and testing of BE
digital health interventions via embedded pragmatic clinical trials. The candidate will receive training in the fields
of dementia, digital health innovation, implementation science, and mixed-methods research through one-on-
one mentorship, coursework, seminars, workshops, and conferences in disciplines of high relevance to the
proposed research. The mentorship team is composed of discipline-specific experts with a history of working
together and with the candidate on NIH funded grant proposals and peer-reviewed publications. The candidate’s
long-term goal is to become an independent investigator in the development and testing of BE-inspired digital
health interventions for chronic disease management in persons living with dementia."

 Vascular injury resulting from hemolysis or ruptured red blood cells is an important clinical issue
associated with numerous hemolytic pathologies including sickle cell disease (SCD), sepsis and iatrogenic
issues in cardiopulmonary bypass surgery, ventricular assist devices and valve replacement. During hemolysis,
red cells release hemoglobin that subsequently discharges heme leading to an oxidative milieu in the
intravascular space. Interestingly, substantial elevation in circulating levels of xanthine oxidase (XO) is also
reported to be associated with numerous hemolytic diseases. While elevated levels of heme are well
characterized in hemolysis pathobiology, the relationship between heme and increased XO activity is unclear.
Here, we provide new data connecting a murine model of intravascular heme injury to excessive amplification in
circulating XO levels (>20-fold). This is important as decades-long bias in the literature would suggest this level
of XO amplification in the circulation to be considered deleterious. Contrary to this long-standing dogma, our new
data suggest XO instead assumes a protective role during heme overload. Pilot studies demonstrate inhibition
of XO with febuxostat during heme overload decreases survival, accelerates organ damage, and elevates
inflammatory responses compared to controls. Consistent with this, plasma from both SCD patients and a murine
model of SCD demonstrate elevation in circulating XO. Importantly, biochemical studies have identified a novel
function for XO: the “splitting” of heme via H2O2 production and subsequent chelation of heme-derived free iron
via uric acid in order to protect the endothelium from overt heme damage. As such, we hypothesize that following
hemopexin saturation, hepatic XO is released to the circulation, binds to endothelium, and assumes a vaso-
protective role during heme overload and SCD-associated heme crisis due to its ability to degrade heme and
subsequently chelate free iron by producing uric acid. We will test this hypothesis using three specific aims:
Aim 1: Define if XO mediates protection during intravascular heme overload. Aim 2: Determine if XO facilitates
“heme splitting” and subsequent iron chelation via XO-derived uric acid. Aim 3: Investigate whether elevated
XO in SCD protects against heme-induced vaso-occlusive crisis. Filling this knowledge gap may uncover new
strategies to address the vascular dysfunction allied to intravascular hemolysis, in general, and SCD, in specific."

Cadmium (Cd) is a known human carcinogen and risk factor for prostate cancer (CaP). The human prostate is
composed of three anatomic zones, namely the peripheral zone (PZ), transition zone (TZ), and central zone
(CZ). CaP arises primarily in the PZ of the prostate and followed by the TZ. Our in vivo studies suggest that
Cd-exposure induced different types of prostate malignances such as, Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in TZ
and poorly differentiated carcinoma (PDC) in PZ of the prostate. Hence, the goal of the study is to understand
the pathobiology and the molecular landscape of Cd-induced SCC in laboratory models (in vitro and in vivo)
and clinical specimens. Chronic exposure of plasma concentrations of Cd in TZ of prostate cells formed
tumors (SCC) in xenotransplanted mice that differed from Cd-induced tumors (PDC) in the PZ of the prostate.
Subsequent, analysis of the mechanism of action revealed that Cd exposure induced the expression of zinc-
finger of the cerebellum 2 (ZIC2) in the benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH: TZ) cells but not in RWPE-1 (PZ)
cells. At a molecular level, ZIC2 interacts with glioma-associated oncogene family zinc finger 1 (GLI1), a
downstream target of sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling, which activates the pro-survival machinery in Cd-
exposed BPH1 cells. Similarly, overexpression of ZIC2 in RWPE-1 cells resulted in spheroid formation,
confirming the oncogenic function of ZIC2. Also, we found ZIC2, and GLI1 expressions were correspondingly
increased in different grades of CaP as compared to BPH or adjacent healthy tissue (Chandrasekaran et
al.,2020 Oncogenesis). Based on these results, we hypothesize that the activation of ZIC2 and GLI1 is
responsible for the malignant transformation (SCC) of Cd exposed BPH cells. Aim 1: Dissect the mechanism
by which Cd activates ZIC2 and determine whether ZIC2 activation is essential for the malignant
transformation of BPH1 & BPH/hTERT1 cells. Aim-2: Determine the molecular interplay between ZIC2 and
GLI1 activation and examine their function in Cd exposed BPH1 & BPH/hTERT1 cells. Aim 3: Study Cd-
induced tumorigenesis in mouse models and validate molecular markers in human CaP specimens. The
successful completion of the studies will not only contribute new information towards filling the lacunae of
knowledge regarding the pathobiology of Cd-induced SCC, but also provide an insight into the molecular
mechanisms (MTF-1, ZIC2 and GLI1 signaling) pertaining to SCC as well as other metal induced
malignances."

Both resident and peripheral immune cells are increasingly implicated in the pathophysiology of various
neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism, but the mechanisms by which these non-neuronal cells impact
the brain is largely unknown. Infiltrating immune cells in the brain readily respond to environmental triggers,
promoting persistent proinflammatory signaling that permanently alters developing cells and damages non-
renewing populations. The resident immune cells of the brain, microglia, regulate normal physiologic processes
to guide brain development, but little is known about the contribution of infiltrating immune cells to these same
processes. In my preliminary studies, I found thousands of mast cells, a component of the innate immune system,
inhabiting the lateral ventricles adjacent the hippocampus, throughout perinatal stages of brain development.
This raises the question – what role might such proinflammatory cells serve in the developing brain? Mast cells
(MC) are both highly sensitive to a variety of stimuli and reflexively produce a wide assortment of vasoactive
molecules, cytokines, and growth factors, making them a potential neuro-immune hub during neurodevelopment.
Moreover, since mast cells are so exquisitely responsive to inflammatory signals, they may serve dual functions:
potentially supporting cell genesis and maturation, or perpetrating damage. This proposal seeks to address gaps
in our understanding of MC recruitment, heterogeneity, and function in the developing brain to assess how this
population may contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders. We have shown, for the first time, that brain MC
are replicating along the hippocampal fissure and are maintained in this region for the first two postnatal weeks,
paralleling neurogenesis and microglial maturation occurring nearby. Advanced flow cytometric techniques will
test the hypothesis that they are locally proliferating, which MC do not typically do outside of the bone marrow
(Aim 1.1). To elucidate their functional and molecular identity in the developing CNS, we will perform single cell
RNA-sequencing of brain MCs and compare their transcriptome to prototypical MCs from the skin and bone
marrow (Aim 1.2). Findings from transcriptomic analyses will guide exploration of their mechanism of influence
on typical developmental processes in the hippocampus. Lastly, MC are well known to coordinate with microglia
in the injured adult brain, but this relationship has not been thoroughly explored during development. We will test
our hypothesis that MCs release signaling factors that promote microglial maturation in the hippocampus (Aim
2). These findings will reframe understanding of the developing brain as an immune-enabled site requiring
nuanced neuro-immune interactions to sustain developmental processes. This project fosters training in
bioinformatics and immersion in two historically independent fields to prepare me for a career investigating
neural-immune communication in health and disease. Scientific mentorship from neuroscientist Dr. Margaret
McCarthy and immunologist Dr. Nevil Singh, paralleled by clinical mentorship from neuroimmunologist Dr. David
Benavides, will establish a strong foundation for my life as a physician-scientist in the field of child neurology."
10808169,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Allergic asthma affects approximately 300 million people worldwide. As the incidence of asthma continues to
rise, studies linking immune and pathophysiologic mechanisms to asthma endotypes are of great importance
to establish more targeted and effective therapies. Severe, steroid-insensitive (non-eosinophilic) asthma
accounts for greater than half the current disease burden, but few studies have focused on modeling this
disease subset. In severe refractory disease, allergen-specific, steroid-insensitive T helper (Th) 17 and/or Th2
cells are thought to critically orchestrate asthma pathogenesis, resulting in pulmonary inflammation, mucus
hypersecretion, and airway hyperresponsiveness. The Th17 immune cytokine interleukin (IL)-22 plays a vital
role in maintaining epithelial integrity and promoting repair. IL-22 receptor alpha-2 (IL-22Ra2), a soluble
receptor for IL-22, inhibits its activity. The significance of IL-22 and endogenous IL-22Ra2, as well as the
pathways that regulate them in severe asthma, are unknown. Aside from IL-22Ra2, type I interferons (IFN),
consisting of IFNα subtypes and IFNβ, are immunomodulators that alter IL-10 and IL-22 signaling in certain
inflammatory disease contexts. Based on our preliminary and published findings, we hypothesize that IL-
22Ra2 and type I IFNs perpetuate severe allergic airway disease (AAD) by blocking IL-22 signaling,
which is necessary to alleviate AAD and maintain epithelial integrity in the lung. The following aims will
investigate this hypothesis: 1) Investigate whether IL-22Ra2 modulates severe AAD by altering IL-22
bioavailability in the lung, 2) Determine if type I IFNs promote severe AAD by inducing IL-22Ra2 and limiting
IL-22 activity in the lung, and 3) Examine if IL-22 signaling in the epithelium of the lung alleviates severe AAD
and maintains epithelial integrity in the lung. The proposed work in this application will pioneer investigations
into the role of IL-22Ra2 and type I interferons as regulators of allergic disease and will uncover the potential
molecular mechanisms by which the IL-22 axis protects the lung epithelium during AAD. This novel work in a
preclinical animal model and human samples will uncover new therapeutic targets for the treatment of severe
asthma that is poorly responsive to standard therapies."
10808064,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Individuals receiving maintenance hemodialysis (HD) have exceedingly high mortality, driven largely by
cardiovascular events. The rate of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in the HD population exceeds that of the
general population by more than 20-fold. Risk factors for SCD such as structural heart disease and conduction
abnormalities are common among people with end-stage kidney disease, but traditional preventive strategies,
such as antiarrhythmic medications and implantable cardioverter defibrillators, do not lower SCD risk in HD
patients. However, medication-provoked SCD may be preventable, and, to-date, has been understudied in HD
patients. Dialysis patients are often prescribed medications that have the undesirable, off-target effect of
delayed ventricular repolarization, which manifests as QT-interval prolongation on an electrocardiogram, and
can trigger fatal arrhythmias. Although more than 50% of dialysis patients are prescribed medications that can
prolong the QT-interval (e.g. certain antidepressants, antibiotics, antiemetics), there are critical knowledge
gaps about the cardiac safety of these medications. In fact, their safety profiles rest on data obtained from
healthy volunteers and have not been explicitly evaluated in HD patients. By executing the proposed studies,
we will provide a comprehensive understanding of the essential safety data relevant to the prescription of non-
cardiac QT-prolonging medications to HD patients. In Aim 1, we will determine the relative SCD risk of the
most commonly prescribed non-cardiac medications with higher QT-prolonging potential vs. clinically relevant
comparator medications with lower QT-prolonging potential among HD patients. In Aim 2, we will identify
modifiable clinical factors (e.g. dialysate composition and concurrent prescription medications) that may be
targeted to mitigate SCD risk from QT-prolonging medications. In Aim 3, we will identify prescribers of higher
risk QT-prolonging medications and associated encounters that should prompt medication reconciliation and
decision support tool use. Then, in Aim 4, we will develop individualized decision support tools for QT-
prolonging medication prescribing that integrate many comorbid conditions, HD treatment, and medication-
related risk factors. This work will yield decision support tools that facilitate personalized SCD risk
assessments and safer prescribing of QT-prolonging medications to reduce SCD risk among HD patients.
Moreover, the decision support tools generated in this project will serve as the subject of future pragmatic trials
testing the impact of tool implementation on cardiovascular outcomes."
10808065,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a genetically heterogeneous group of diseases affecting about 100,000 people in
the United States. RP causes progressive death of rod, then cone, photoreceptors resulting in relentless vision
loss and ultimate blindness. There are no cures, and effective treatments are extremely limited. Complicating
treatment efforts is the fact that mutations in over 65 genes cause RP. As such, therapies that target common
mechanisms of photoreceptor death and promote photoreceptor survival are attractive alternatives to gene-
specific methods. Although rods are lost earliest in RP, it is the subsequent cone degeneration that is
particularly devastating for patients. This cone degeneration may be due in part to oxidative stress, and
treatments that reduce oxidative damage such as N-acetylcysteine (NAC) have been shown to improve cone
function and survival in animal models. Recently, a single-center study in patients with RP (FIGHT-RP)
demonstrated improvement in visual acuity at all NAC doses studied, and improvement in macular sensitivity in
patients who received the highest dose. These promising results have motivated the development of a
multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial (NAC Attack) to test the efficacy of NAC to slow
progression of RP. The NAC Attack trial may provide clinical evidence of the role of oxidative stress and lead
to improved understanding of cone degeneration mechanisms in RP. Although the NAC Attack trial aims to
impact clinical management of RP by demonstrating improved photoreceptor survival, standard outcome
measures have limited sensitivity to detect effects of treatments on individual cones, the target of NAC.
Adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscopy (AOSLO) allows non-invasive imaging of the cone mosaic with
single-cell resolution. Preliminary studies using AOSLO showed reduced cone loss in eyes with RP treated
with ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) compared to contralateral sham-treated eyes; however, CNTF-treated
eyes showed no improvement in vision (illustrating the low sensitivity of clinical measures of visual function).
These data demonstrate a critical role for AOSLO in clinical trials. The objective of this AOSLO Resource
Center is to support the evaluation of the safety and efficacy of NAC in patients with RP. Forty patients
enrolled at 6 sites with AOSLO systems will be imaged at baseline, 9, 27 and 45 months after randomization to
receive oral NAC 1800 mg or a placebo twice a day. AOSLO images will be used to measure changes in cone
density, cone spacing, cone mosaic regularity and cone reflectivity in NAC-treated compared to placebo-
treated eyes between baseline and 45 months. Successful completion of the proposed studies described here
would support FDA approval of NAC for treatment of patients with RP. The results will also provide quantitative
data to support validation of AOSLO images of cone structure as objective, sensitive outcome measures of
disease progression which could significantly reduce the time and numbers of patients required to demonstrate
whether other experimental therapies are safe and effective for patients with rare IRDs."
10808070,"This is a competitive renewal application to further characterize the immunoregulatory function of
mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in ocular inflammation. Renowned for promoting tissue regeneration and
immune quiescence, studies have demonstrated the therapeutic potential of MSCs in human disease.
Nevertheless, fundamental questions remain unanswered regarding their immunomodulatory mechanisms.
This proposal employs a well-characterized transplant model of the murine cornea to systematically
investigate how MSCs directly interact with T cells to suppress alloimmunity.
 Over recent years the work of several laboratories, including our own, has made substantial
progress in understanding how MSCs regulate ocular inflammation. With respect to corneal transplantation,
we and others have shown that exogenous administration of MSCs suppresses alloimmunity and promotes
graft survival. Reports from our lab provide evidence that MSCs: (i) specifically home to the ocular surface
following corneal transplantation, where they act to (ii) limit antigen-presenting cell (APC) maturation, and
(iii) decrease graft-destroying IFNγ + T helper-1 (Th1) cell responses. Moreover, our preliminary data and
reports from other groups indicate that administration of MSCs following transplantation induces Foxp3+
regulatory T cells (Tregs). Despite these observations, the exact mechanisms by which MSCs suppress
Th1 generation and induce Tregs are not known. Our preliminary investigations indicate that, in addition to
indirect modulation via APCs, MSCs exert a direct immunomodulatory effect on alloreactive T cells.
 We define 3 specific aims to answer the following questions: Aim 1: What are the mechanisms by
which MSCs inhibit generation of alloreactive Th1 cells? Aim 2: What are the mechanisms by which MSCs
inhibit effector function of alloreactive Th1 cells? And finally Aim 3: How do MSCs promote the generation
of tolerance-inducing Tregs? Our preliminary data implicate specific soluble and surface-bound
immunoregulatory molecules. Based on these data, we propose 3 hypotheses: (1) MSCs negatively
regulate early T cell activation via the surface-bound molecule ALCAM, resulting in decreased generation of
Th1 cells; (2) MSC-secreted IL11 suppresses Th1 function by antagonizing IFNγ and Tbet expression; and
(3) MSCs skew the differentiation of naïve T cells toward Foxp3+ Tregs via CD80/CTLA-4 interaction. The
principal objective of this project is to define the molecular mechanisms by which MSCs directly interact
with T cells to regulate alloimmunity. Given the considerable expense of delivering MSC-based cell
therapies, identifying the factors that mediate the immunoregulatory activity of MSCs is a research priority. It
is anticipated that completion of these entirely novel aims will elucidate as-yet-unknown mechanisms by
which MSCs regulate T cell responses, and may conceivably provide a framework for the development of
new therapeutic approaches in transplantation and other T cell-mediated inflammatory disorders."
10808170,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Whole chromosomal losses and gains (aneuploidy) that arise during meiosis and/or mitosis are major
contributors to embryo loss and spontaneous miscarriage in natural and assisted reproduction, and their
prevalence varies drastically in mammals across the Boreoeutheria tree. Although human, non-human primate,
and bovine embryos all have a relatively high incidence of aneuploidy, murine embryos rarely exhibit aneuploidy,
and equine and porcine embryos still await investigation with high-resolution, whole-genome methods. It is now
well-established that meiotic and mitotic chromosome segregation errors are equally prevalent, but the specific
contribution of mitotic aneuploidy to embryo loss amongst mammalian species is still unclear. Cellular
fragmentation (CF), the dynamic process by which cytoplasmic bodies pinch off of embryos during cytokinesis,
is often associated with aneuploidy and has been observed in both in vitro and in vivo-derived embryos from
several mammals, albeit to varying degrees. While primate and equine embryos exhibit a high incidence of CF,
porcine and bovine embryos show intermediate and a low frequency, respectively, and mouse embryos do not
typically display CF. We recently demonstrated with human and rhesus macaque embryos, that CFs can enclose
DNA that likely originated from the encapsulation of mis-segregated chromosomes into micronuclei during
meiosis or mitosis. However, it remains unknown if chromosome sequestration via CF is an evolutionary shared
process to correct embryo aneuploidy, or if there are species differences in CF dynamics. The overall goal of
this proposal is to leverage the natural diversity in the aneuploidy and CF frequency across mammals and study
the molecular mechanisms underlying micronucleation, aneuploidy, and CF using high-resolution sequencing
approaches. For Aim 1, we will perform a combination of live-cell imaging, single-cell/CF DNA-sequencing, and
copy number variation (CNV) analyses to establish the precise frequency of aneuploidy and chromosome
encapsulation by CF in primate, equine, porcine, and bovine embryos. Aim 2 will focus on identifying differentially
expressed genes between fragmented and non-fragmented embryos within and across the same mammals
using RNA-sequencing. In Aim 3, we propose to manipulate the expression of previously discovered and/or
newly identified differentially expressed CF-related genes in murine and bovine embryos. We will then assess
the impact of gene knockdown or overexpression on preimplantation embryo development in vitro using real-
time imaging and single-cell/CF CNV assessment. Implantation potential and subsequent embryogenesis will
also be evaluated in vivo by transferring murine embryos with or without gene manipulation to pseudo-pregnant
female recipient mice. Overall, the proposed study will greatly advance our understanding of the molecular
mechanisms involved in chromosome mis-segregation during early mammalian embryogenesis, the findings
from which can be applied to improving reproductive efficiency in agriculturally important species and human in
vitro fertilization (IVF) success by reducing the incidence of embryo loss."

 In part A we demonstrate that we have the personnel and facilities to conduct ADRN network-wide and
CRC center-specific research on pediatric and adult AD patient populations recruited from the allergy and
dermatology clinics at Boston Children's Hospital and collaborating adult centers at the Brigham and Women's
Hospital Mas General Hospital and Boston University Medical Center and Hospital, and from our just

capable of processing, storing and shipping human samples, a state-of-the-art immunology research laboratory
with a 25 year focus on AD, and a data management facility with quality control plans, and capability to upload
data into the NIAID designated repositories and biostatistical support.
 Project I in part B will draw on an already genotyped local population of AD patients to test the
hypothesis that the IL-4Rα R576 polymorphism is associated with increased AD severity and alterations in the
function and gene expression of epidermal and immune cells. We will also use a mouse model of AD to test
the hypothesis that both epidermal and immune cells contribute to the increased antigen allergic skin
inflammation observed in mice with the IL-4Rα R576R polymorphism.
 Project II in part B will test the hypothesis that S. aureus skin decolonization in AD will reduce disease
severity and favorably alter the function and gene expression of epidermal and immune cells that contribute to
disease severity. We will also test the hypothesis that S. aureus skin colonization promotes the development of
antigen-driven allergic skin inflammation, and its reactivation, using a mouse model of AD.
 Our proposal will contribute extensively to the ADRN as a Clinical Research Unit and, as an ADRN-CRC will
help elucidate the role of genetic and microbial modifiers in AD.

10808088,"Project Summary: Autoimmunity is a leading cause of chronic illness that encompasses more than 80
individual diseases. Due to the rising prevalence of these diseases, autoimmunity associated health problems
currently affect over 20 million individuals only in the USA, constituting a health crisis that requires immediate
attention. Autoimmune diseases stem from disturbances in the tolerance of immune system against self-tissues.
Immune tolerance is achieved in part by the elimination of self-reactive T cells during their development in the
thymus. The self-reactive clones that escape thymic elimination are actively silenced in the periphery by a
subset of T cells called “regulatory” T (Treg) cells. Because Treg defects result in fatal autoimmunity,
increasing Treg number and activity in the body appears to be a desirable strategy to prevent and treat
autoimmune diseases. However, we have a major gap in our understanding of how Tregs perform their
inhibitory roles at the molecular level and this hinders the development of effective therapeutic strategies.
Recently, I demonstrated, for the first time, that Tregs can inhibit effector T cells in an antigen-specific manner.
I reported that Treg antigen receptor (TCR) can remove class II major histocompatibility complex bound
antigenic peptide (pMHCII) from surface of antigen presenting cell (APC), dendritic cell (DC) in particular, thus
deplete the antigenic stimulus that effector T cell needs to receive to get activated. I revealed that this
happens during Treg-Dendritic cell (DC) contact, whereby cognate pMHCII laden DC membrane is captured
by Treg in an elegant way that does not reduce the presentation of non-cognate pMHCII by the same DC. I
hypothesize that this highly specific mechanism can be exploited to effectively reduce pathological presentation
of self-antigen by APC as a promising strategy to combat autoimmunity. I will test this hypothesis by taking the
following steps: 1) Determining the antigen specificity of Treg suppression and pMHCII removal in human
Tregs and visualizing their interactions with DCs that present self-antigens. 2) Characterizing the molecular
machinery employed by Tregs to perform pMHCII depletion and dissect the molecular switches that can be
targeted to tune Treg activity. 3) Determining the functional significance of antigen capture by Tregs to
reveal potential mechanisms whereby Tregs present captured pMHCII complexes to prime naive T cells
resulting in the spreading of antigen specific tolerance. By uncovering novel pathways of antigen-specific
immune suppression, this New Innovator Award will identify new targets for immune system modulation
that can be utilized for the treatment of chronic diseases such as autoimmunity and cancer. Findings from this
project will be instrumental in generating future antigen-targeted immunotherapies, thus the objectives of this
New Innovator Award serve the strategic mission of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases."

Aging is the major risk factor for multiple chronic diseases and two-thirds of individuals over the age of 65
suffer from multiple age-related conditions. Rather than trying to cure each individual disease, healthy aging
can be promoted by targeting the biological pathways that regulate the rate of aging. The mTORC1
(mechanistic target of rapamycin complex I) signaling pathway promotes cellular growth and development
when nutrients are abundant and its inhibition extends lifespan in a range of species. However, the promise of
mTORC1 inhibition as an anti-aging therapeutic is limited by the associated negative side effects such as
stunted growth, development, and fertility. The overarching goal of this project is to understand the
mechanisms and key tissues through which mTORC1 specifically regulates aging in an effort to
identify ways to target the mTORC1 pathway that can uncouple longevity from adverse health effects.
Previous work in C. elegans found evidence that mTORC1 regulates aging through the neurons. In a long-lived
mutant with decreased mTORC1 signaling throughout its entire body, restoring mTORC1 signaling only in the
neurons suppressed the lifespan back to wild type. However, this neuronal mTORC1 rescue had no effect on
the impaired growth or development of the null mutant, suggesting that targeting mTORC1 in key tissues may
be a strategy to uncouple aging regulation form other mTORC1 functions. Lastly, this work found that restoring
neuronal mTORC1 signaling induced changes in the expression of multiple neuropeptide genes and altered
the shape of the mitochondrial network in peripheral tissues. Building on these findings, we have recently
generated new data showing that neuron-specific mTORC1 inhibition in C. elegans extends lifespan without
impairing growth or development. Thus, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that mTORC1 regulates
aging, independently of other functions, through the neurons by modulating neuronal signaling and
inducing metabolic changes cell-nonautonomously in peripheral tissues. We will use a suite of tissue-
specific tools to investigate this hypothesis and probe the mechanisms of aging regulation by mTORC1 with
unprecedented specificity. In Aim 1, we will assess how neuronal mTORC1 inhibition affects phenotypes
associated with whole-body mTORC1 inhibition – such as growth, development, reproduction, and stress
resistance – and test whether there are changes to the mitochondrial network in peripheral tissues. We will
also identify downstream biological pathways that are required for neuronal mTORC1 longevity. In Aim 2, we
will identify the specific neuronal signaling molecules and types of neurons through which mTORC1 acts to
regulate aging. Altogether, this work will deepen our understanding of how metabolic pathways regulate aging
and allow us to design strategies to target these pathways in a manner that promotes healthy longevity."
10808090,"Project Summary / Abstract
Formation of cortical circuits during fetal cortical development involves the assembly of glutamatergic neurons and
GABAergic interneurons. After their specification, GABAergic interneurons migrate dorsally to reach the cortex and
undergo activity-dependent maturation and integration into glutamatergic circuits. Genetic perturbations of this process can
lead to miswiring of early cortical circuits and to excitation/inhibition imbalance which is thought to underlie various
disorders such as schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders and epilepsies. The neurobiological basis of how disease-
associated gene variants affect the assembly of early cortical circuits in humans remain unknown. This is mainly due to the
lack of patient tissue available for functional studies. In response to this, we have recently developed a 3D in vitro platform
of forebrain development, termed forebrain Assembloids, where region-specific forebrain cultures derived from human
induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are functionally assembled. Using this platform, we showed that GABAergic
interneurons migrate towards and integrate with glutamatergic neurons forming cortical ensembles that exhibits
glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic activity. When we surveyed for differentially expressed genes in interneurons that
migrated in the cortical network, we identified TCF4, a basic loop-helix-loop transcription factor, potentially indicating a
role in interneuron functional maturation. In line with this idea, several TCF4 variants have been identified across clinically
distinct disorders that have been frequently associated with interneuron dysfunction, such as schizophrenia, autism spectrum
disorders, intellectual disability and epileptic encephalopathies. TCF4 is a major transcriptional hub that, through its cell-
type-specific dimerization partners regulated by intracellular calcium levels, can assume different roles at various stages of
fetal brain development. As such, TCF4 dosage is thought to be tightly regulated during development. It has been
hypothesized that the degree by which each TCF4 variants affects its dosage is correlated with specific clinical outcomes,
although this has not yet been thoroughly tested in humans. The goal of this proposal is to understand mechanisms by which
distinct TCF4 variants affect the TCF4 regulatory network and lead to molecular and cellular deficits in human interneurons
during assembly of early cortical circuits in the forebrain Assembloids. During the K99 phase, I propose to generate and
characterize hiPSC lines harboring various disease-associated TCF4 mutations using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing through
training in the Porteus lab. I will then generate forebrain Assembloids from these lines and interrogate whether migration,
intrinsic properties, synaptic integration and functional connectivity of cortical interneurons are disrupted in cortical
ensembles, through training in the Huguenard lab. During the independent R00 phase, I will investigate molecular deficits
TCF4-related gene networks related to deficits uncovered in Aim 1 and 2 and explore pharmacological targets for rescue
experiments. Comprehensive training with Drs. Pasca, Huguenard and Porteus at Stanford University will provide me with
the skills required to further pursue this line of research as an independent investigator. These efforts will lead to mechanistic
insights into a major biological pathway that is potentially shared across a diverse array of psychiatric disorders."
10808204,"Project Summary
Experience shapes cortical sensory representations in a remarkable manner during development, but after
maturation capacity for plasticity becomes limited. The tightly regulated plasticity of the mature cortex enables
learning but impedes the brain’s capacity to regain appropriate function after injury, stroke or prolonged sensory
loss. Studying mechanisms that underlie perceptual learning in the adult stage will advance our understanding
of perception and will provide the foundation to develop novel approaches that promote plasticity in the adult
brain. Recent studies in the tree shrew (tupaia belangeri), a highly visual mammal that shares cortical
organization features with primates, show that learning a reward-based orientation discrimination task leads to
long lasting changes in excitatory responses that increase discriminability between task relevant stimuli in the
mature primary visual cortex (V1). However, we lack a clear understanding of the underlying circuit mechanisms
that are responsible for these changes. I will combine my previous experience studying mechanisms of synaptic
plasticity with new training focused on expanding my technical expertise in cutting edge optical approaches to
uncover the mechanisms underlying perceptual learning in the tree shrew. Preliminary data suggest that a
transient and feature specific decrease in the inhibitory network response precedes changes in the excitatory
neuronal population associated with enhanced performance, showing that the learning process in tree shrew V1
layer 2/3 is a precise one where circuit elements are engaged with both feature and temporal specificity. I will
employ chronic 2-photon imaging in combination with novel genetic enhancers and precise RNAscope
technology to determine changes in the response properties of V1 inhibitory neural subpopulations during
perceptual learning (Aim 1). Additionally, I will define changes in the functional synaptic architecture of excitatory
neurons that undergo learning-related changes (Aim 2) by applying calcium imaging of dendritic spines through
the learning process. Finally, I will establish the spatiotemporal recruitment of acetylcholine release during
discrimination learning (Aim 3) by taking advantage of a recently developed cholinergic sensor that can be
imaged chronically through learning stages. This project capitalizes on the functional organization of the tree
shrew V1 area as a unique model to address how perceptual learning is implemented in highly structured cortical
networks akin to those found in the primate cortex. The studies will take place in a collaborative environment at
Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience (MPFI) known for developing innovative approaches to address
fundamental questions about neural circuits and hosting one of the few tree shrew colonies in the world.
Completion of these aims and training plan will lead to a comprehensive framework describing the progression
of learning-related plasticity in a functionally structured cortex upon which I will build an independent research
program in the future."
10808205,"Cholesterol is abundant in the retina, which maintains cholesterol homeostasis by balancing the pathways of
cholesterol input and output. Retinal cholesterol input includes local biosynthesis and uptake from the systemic
circulation. Retinal cholesterol output is realized via photoreceptor phagocytosis, metabolism to oxysterols by
cytochrome P450 enzymes, and transport to the systemic circulation by lipoproteins. Elaborate mechanisms
control and coordinate retinal cholesterol input and output to maintain lipid steady-state levels. Accumulating
data implicate retinal cholesterol dyshomeostasis in the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration
(AMD), the leading cause of vision loss in the elderly of the industrialized world. The details of the cholesterol-
AMD link are, however, still unclear, due to insufficient knowledge about retinal cholesterol maintenance. During
the previous grant period, we ascertained: 1) the relative contributions of retinal cholesterol biosynthesis and
uptake of systemic cholesterol to the total retinal cholesterol input; 2) retinal significance of cholesterol transport
and storage; and 3) the effect of different pharmacologic treatments on lowering retinal cholesterol. Specifically,
we found that local biosynthesis is the major source of retinal cholesterol in mice, and a pathway, which can be
inhibited by a cholesterol lowering drug simvastatin. Furthermore, we established that apolipoproteins E and D
are important for retinal cholesterol transport, a pathway which could be targeted pharmacologically as well and
lead to retinal cholesterol lowering. Finally, we discovered that cholesterol excess could be esterified in the retina
and form lipid droplets, i.e., identified a mechanism for managing retinal cholesterol overload. In this renewal we
will continue to delineate the unknown aspects of retinal cholesterol maintenance that are of unquestionable
importance for our understanding of how to combat AMD. Aim 1 will evaluate hamsters as a model for studies
of retinal cholesterol. Among rodents, hamsters are much closer to humans than mice in terms of their whole
body cholesterol maintenance. Hence, we will investigate whether there is any advantage in using hamsters for
establishing the details of retinal cholesterol homeostasis as well as pharmacologic treatments. Aims 2 and 3
will still use mice as studies under these Aims should not be affected by potential interspecies differences in
retinal cholesterol maintenance. Aim 2 will focus on 2-hydroxypropyl-b-cyclodextrin, the FDA-approved
pharmaceutical that targets cholesterol distribution. The pharmacologic potential of this cholesterol-related
process for retinal cholesterol lowering has not yet been investigated and will be tested on several mouse
models. Aim 3 will establish retinal significance of apolipoprotein J for the pathway of retinal cholesterol
transport. Several apolipoproteins appear to be necessary for cholesterol trafficking in the retina, including
apolipoprotein J, a protein with unique functions. Collectively, the three Aims will provide principally new
information about cholesterol in the retina and facilitate the development of new therapeutics for the diseases
associated with deleterious accumulations of cholesterol in the retina and Bruch’s membrane."
10808206,"Project Summary: Genomic Diversity and the Architectures of Adaptation and Incompatibility
 This research program addresses fundamental yet unresolved questions at the interface between genetic
variation and evolutionary processes. In particular, it focuses on three interconnected research themes: (1)
The Genetic Complexity of Adaptive Trait Evolution, (2) The Genetic Basis of Early Stage Reproductive
Isolation, and (3) The Determinants of Genomic Diversity and Adaptive Potential. It fuses ambitious but
cost-effective Drosophila experiments with novel approaches to the analysis of large genomic data sets.
 D. melanogaster offers critical advantages for this work. The global expansion of this species enables the
study of adaptive trait differences, and partial reproductive isolation, between populations that diverged in the
last ~10,000 years. Due to this recent time-scale, adaptive differences may be detected from genetic variation.
The experimental efficiency of Drosophila allows the study of large lab populations across many generations.
Its compact genome allows economical sequencing. Once relevant genes are found, functional confirmation
and study are aided by a well-annotated genome and a wealth of genetic resources and transgenic tools.
 This research will bolster understanding of The Genetic Complexity of Adaptive Trait Evolution. Initial
findings have suggested a portrait of adaptation that often begins with standing genetic variation, includes
variants with larger effect sizes, and features variable genetic architectures among individuals. Proposed work
will solidify and extend these inferences in multiple respects, including by launching scaled-up mapping studies
for a wider range of adaptive traits, and pursuing previous hints of epistasis involving adaptive variants.
 Proposed work will also open up a promising new system for studying The Genetic Basis of Early Stage
Reproductive Isolation. African and European D. melanogaster show evidence of incompatibilities impacting
viability and reproduction, but these have received no genetic study. This research will deploy a combination
of incompatibility mapping and population genomics to identify specific incompatibility genes for further study,
and it will advance understanding of the genetic architecture of the earliest stages of reproductive isolation.
 Finally, this research will clarify The Determinants of Genomic Diversity and Adaptive Potential. This
work will feature experimental and computational studies on the relative roles of neutral and adaptive genetic
diversity in future adaptation, and the most relevant ways to quantify each. It will also investigate the relative
importance of different types of natural selection in shaping genomic diversity, including by probing the utility of
genetic differentiation between populations to separate the signals of positive and negative selection.
 Collectively, this research is highly consequential for basic evolutionary genetics. It also holds strong
medical relevance in terms of the relevance of local adaptation and epistasis for the genetic basis of human
disease and infertility, and for understanding the evolutionary dynamics of insect disease vectors."
10810275,"SUMMARY
In 1973, millions of Michigan residents were exposed to polybrominated biphenyls (PBB), a flame-retardant
chemical, in what is considered one of the largest environmental disasters in US history and led to the creation
of the Michigan PBB Registry. At 50 years old, this environmental epidemiology cohort (EEC) is one of the
longest running multigenerational cohorts in the US with over 7,500 participants, making it uniquely situated
for studying the health effects of an endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) across the lifecourse and across
generations. Since 2011, the Michigan PBB EEC has had strong community-researcher partnerships with the
Pine River Superfund Citizen Task Force, PBB Citizen Advisory Board, and Mid-Michigan District Health
Department. The Michigan PBB EEC primarily consists of rural, White residents who were exposed to PBB as
adults. In this proposal, we seek to expand community engagement and participation in the PBB EEC to
include Detroit residents and the younger generations through community meetings and focus groups. The
expanded and diversified cohort will facilitate future research on the trans-generational impacts of EDCs,
including biological mechanisms, and the role of EDC exposure in combination with other aspects of the
exposome, particularly social factors such as structural racism. To date, the Michigan PBB EEC has produced
>150 scientific contributions with continuous federal research funding since 1996. We now propose to expand
collaboration with participants and scholars from historically underrepresented groups. We will ensure that this
valuable cohort is accessible to trainees and researchers beyond Emory University, especially those at
minority and undergraduate serving institutions. We will update the participants’ health status and link PBB
EEC data to several cancer registries. We will enhance the Researcher and Participant Portals, improving
communication, documentation and metadata, harmonizing standard language and common data elements for
optimal data sharing, building family pedigrees to enable trans-generational research, and disseminating our
continuing medical education course on EDCs to healthcare providers. The Michigan PBB EEC has trained
diverse students since 1996, training 12 postdoctoral fellows and 89 students at multiple colleges and
universities. Finally, we will leverage the Michigan PBB EEC to recruit, train, and partner with scholars from
populations that are historically underrepresented groups within environmental health research. We will
collaborate with Spelman College, a historically Black college in Atlanta, GA, and Alma College, an
undergraduate serving college in rural Michigan, to mentor students in environmental health. To diversify
researchers who work with the Michigan PBB EEC, we will promote the Researcher Portal at scientific
conferences that prioritize scholars from historically underrepresented communities. Overall, this infrastructure
grant will allow the Michigan PBB EEC to continue, expand, and diversify not only its participants, but trainees
and researchers who can learn and generate new scientific knowledge from this unique cohort."

10793474,"The goal of this proposal is to continue our successful development of TOPAS-nBio, a Monte
Carlo simulation toolkit specifically designed to connect research disciplines. TOPAS-nBio
simulates the initial energy deposition events (physics), then follows the diffusion and reaction
of chemical species (chemistry) to infer biological observables at the cell and organelle scale
(biology). The developed application already lays the foundation to investigate biological ef-
fects of radiation in cell organelles using a mechanistic systems biology modeling approach.
However, with constant advances in our understanding of cellular repair processes, the ques-
tions asked by the radiation biology community are increasing in complexity. These advances,
including more detailed information of various cells lines/types, deficiencies in DNA repair
pathways and potential contributions of non-nuclear cell components, need to be considered to
correctly describe cell response to radiation damages. Accordingly, in this renewal application,
we focus on improving the accuracy of the simulations by including more representative chem-
ical reactions and transitioning towards a predictive model that can be applied to specific cell
types. To further extend the reach of TOPAS-nBio, we will include changes in the microenvi-
ronment across tumor volumes and move towards mechanistic modeling of radiation effects in
vivo. Thus, the new developments of TOPAS-nBio will offer predictions of biological outcome
from the initial radiation track structure for various cell types for in vitro and in vivo experiments,
and thereby drive hypothesis generation at the forefront of bio-physical research. TOPAS-nBio
provides an ideal framework to include and test new effect models, cell lines or microenviron-
mental conditions. Overall, TOPAS-nBio will continue the mission to advance our under-
standing of the fundamental response of tissue to radiation."
10793476,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Small molecule inhibitors targeting the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway have become potent tools in precision medicine,
but their clinical efficacy is highly variable across the diversity of RAS- and BRAF-mutated cancers. Even in
susceptible cancers, these inhibitors rarely give durable responses. Studying the causes of resistance, which
include ‘paradoxical’ ERK pathway activation by RAF inhibitors, has revealed complex molecular adaptations in
the complicated networks comprised of RAF and ERK pathway kinases. These complexities limit our ability to
understand and predict effectiveness of targeted therapies, especially in combination – despite decades of
intense study, including mathematical modeling. Accurate predictions require understanding not only of the
molecular complexities of protein kinase regulation and the intricate systems-level behavior of the networks that
kinase constitute, but also of how these two levels of control are coupled. The challenge of accurately predicting
effectiveness of targeted therapies and their combinations therefore demands an amalgamation of molecular
and systems biology approaches. The systems biology project proposed here aims to identify optimal
combinations of kinase inhibitors through mechanistic models that integrate understanding of both:
1) Conformation selectivity of kinase inhibitors – affecting structural, thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the
targeted kinase(s); and 2) Systems-level network properties, including feedback loops, mutations and
kinase/scaffold abundances, which can modify feedback loops and allow normally inconsequential kinase
isoforms to compensate for isoform-specific kinase inhibition. Combining these features necessitates novel
approaches to modeling cell signaling that directly link molecular/structural and network facets to predict which
inhibitors and their combinations can efficiently suppress oncogenic signaling while disabling or delaying signal
recovery, growth, and drug resistance. We propose to develop such next-generation multiscale models of
oncogenic ERK signaling and drug responses, and to establish a new conceptual foundation for discovering
effective drug combinations by integrating structural, thermodynamic and kinetic information – and combining
short time-scale molecular dynamics (MD) with long time-scale modeling of systems-level dynamics. We will test
our model predictions rigorously by integrating and iterating modeling and experimental studies. Experimental
studies will begin in paired isogenic cancer cell lines with defined mutational differences. Once model predictions
are suitably robust, we will progress to panels of cancer cell lines, then to cell line-derived xenografts in vivo,
and then to patient-derived xenografts and genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of melanoma – as
a presage to clinically integrated predictions. We will determine if the strategy of hitting a kinase by two (or more)
inhibitors with distinct conformation selectivity – as appears promising in our preliminary data – is generally
applicable, can be combined with inhibition of different targets within a pathway, and can be understood at a
detailed mechanistic level using our multiscale models."
10791492,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States, and non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) comprises over 80 percent of all types of lung cancer. The tumor microenvironment plays an
important role in cancer progression and tumor endothelial cells (TECs) are critical components of this
microenvironment. TECs harbor molecular abnormalities that keeps them in a persistent “activated” state and
are also chronically stimulated by cytokines in the tumor microenvironment. In this proposal, we will study the
significance of a molecular abnormality in TECs, that is induced by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
and regulates the levels of microRNAs (miRNAs).
 MiRNAs are small (21-22 nucleotides) noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression by recruiting
messenger RNAs to the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). MiR-1 is a flagship example of a tumor
suppressor miRNA. We have previously shown that miR-1 levels in TECs isolated from NSCLC patients are
significantly lower than endothelial cells isolated from the non-cancerous lung tissues. Moreover, overexpression
of miR-1 specifically in endothelium decreased tumor burden and vascularity in KRAS-mutant, P53 knock-out
(KP) mice, showing that the downregulation of miR-1 is critical for NSCLC tumor angiogenesis and progression.
 A mechanistic investigation on miR-1 downregulation in endothelial cells showed that VEGF
downregulates mature miR-1 without altering the transcription, processing, or loading of its precursors on RISC.
i.e it degrades mature miR-1. One of the main mechanisms of selective mature miRNA degradation is the
modification and trimming of its 3' end. This process produces 3’ miRNA variants (isomiRs). A small RNA
sequencing analysis on VEGF-stimulated endothelial cells revealed the emergence of unique 3’-adenylated and
-trimmed isomiRs in these cells, suggesting that 3’-adenylation triggers miR-1 degradation. In accord with this
finding, VEGF stimulation selectively increased the expression of terminal nucleotidyltransferase 2 (TENT2), the
main enzyme known to adenylate miRNA 3’ end. TENT2 expression was also increased after VEGF stimulation
in TECs isolated from NSCLC patients. We preliminarily assessed the role of TENT2 in miR-1 regulation and
angiogenesis by testing the effects of its knockdown. These experiments showed that TENT2 knockdown
increases miR-1 levels, inhibits endothelial cell proliferation, and decreases the tumor burden in KP mice. Based
on these findings we have hypothesized that: TENT2 triggers miR-1 degradation in TECs via the non-templated
addition of adenines to its 3' end and through this mechanism regulates tumor angiogenesis and progression in
NSCLC. To test this hypothesis, we propose following aims:
Aim 1: To determine the role of TENT2 in miRNA adenylation and degradation in the tumor endothelium.
Aim 2: To determine the role of endothelial TENT2 in NSCLC tumor angiogenesis and progression"
10791694,"ABSTRACT
Adolescence is a critical period for the onset of depressive symptoms. During the transition from childhood to
adolescence, friends become increasingly salient conversation partners and a primary source of social support.
Notably, evidence now suggests that adolescent friends’ levels of depression can predict change in each others’
levels over time, in a process called ‘depression contagion’. The current project aims to advance knowledge on
the process of depression contagion in adolescence by studying granular, and potentially modifiable
interpersonal processes that may contribute to depressive contagion, as well as factors that may moderate risk
for contagion, with an eye toward informing development of preventative interventions. Using an experience
sampling design in the natural environment of best friend dyads, we propose four aims: (1) examination of
momentary contagion of affective states between best-friend dyads, with a focus on dysphoric and positive affect,
as those most strongly relate to depressive conditions; (2) examination of friends’ communication in both online
and offline contexts as mechanisms driving contagion, considering communication in the context of negative (co-
rumination) and positive (co-dampening) affect and experiences as mediators of the contagion process; (3)
investigation of individual difference characteristics as potential moderators (sex, empathetic distress,
empathetic joy) of affective contagion, to identify factors which create vulnerability; and (4) to conduct a
preliminary examination of the extent to which affective contagion may mediate change in depressive symptoms
within a brief longitudinal design.
To achieve our aims, we will first do a depression screening in classrooms in grades 9-12 to obtain a sample
with varying levels of depressive symptoms. Based on screening levels, one hundred dyads (n = 200) of true
best friends in grades 9-12 will be signaled on their smartphone daily for 14 days to answer questions about thier
affective states (depressed and happy affect) since their previous report, contact with best friend since previous
report, and in instances in which contact occurred, context of contact and ratings of co-rumination and co-
dampening since previous report. They will further complete two assessments (baseline and follow-up after 7
weeks). A rigorous dyadic approach is used in both the design and analysis plan. Specifically, data will be
analyzed using longitudinal actor-partner interdependence model, allowing the capture of state-level, momentary
changes in both friends due to contagion.
This project has the potential to offer unprecedented insights which will be crucial to better characterize the
process of depression contagion. Furthermore, it can provide more precise and nuanced understanding of
interpersonal friendship behaviors for tailored, “just in time” prevention and intervention efforts."
10793764,"Dementia is most prevalent in Black and Hispanic older adults who are increasingly cared for in nursing
homes (NHs). Staff shortages and lack of dementia care skills limit care quality, especially in NHs with high
proportions of ethnoracially diverse residents. Care for persons living with dementia (PLWD) in NHs is
complicated by behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) when residents cannot express
unmet physical and psychosocial needs. BPSD increase staff stress and time to complete care, contribute to
staff turnover and injury, and lead to use of inappropriate psychoactive medication to control resident BPSD.
 Our team demonstrated that BPSD occur when staff use elderspeak (speech that sounds like baby
talk). Elderspeak features inappropriately intimate terms of endearment (diminutives such as “honey”), belittling
pronoun substitutions that imply dependence (“we” need a bath), and harsh task-oriented commands (“sit
down”). Elderspeak conveys a message of disrespect and incompetence to PLWD who react with withdrawal
or BPSD. Our prior research established that elderspeak use more than doubled the occurrences of BPSD
responses in NH residents with dementia. We later confirmed that the three-session Changing Talk (CHAT)
communication education intervention reduced staff elderspeak use that significantly reduced resident BPSD.
 CHAT in online format (CHATO) has demonstrated communication knowledge and confidence gains
and is currently being testing in a national clinical trial. However, NHs serving higher proportions of diverse
residents have not shown interest in participation, despite having more frequent and serious care deficiencies
including higher rates of BPSD and antipsychotic medication use. Research has established that tailoring and
intensification approaches are often needed for interventions across care settings to reduce care disparities.
 We will first engage staff in six NHs caring for diverse residents and our expert stakeholder panel to
adapt the current CHATO intervention using the ADAPT framework to increase cultural competency. We will
test the adapted intervention (CHATO-I) in a waitlist-controlled trial in 40 NHs that care for high proportions of
minority residents (<75% White, non-Hispanic). NHs will be randomized to four groups and staff will complete
the adapted intervention with high-intensity implementation support (i.e., weekly meetings, troubleshooting,
expert consultation, leadership/champion training, incentives, tablets, and technology support). We will
evaluate feasibility and acceptability (participation and completion rates) and use mixed modeling of electronic
medical record data to assess preliminary effects on resident BPSD and psychoactive medication use.
 The NIA Health Disparities Framework will guide adaptation and testing in NHs serving diverse
residents with a goal of reducing health disparities (BPSD and psychoactive medication use), addressing
National Plan to Address Alzheimer’s disease goals, NIA’s milestones for nonpharmacological interventions,
and the National Academy Imperative to Improve NH care equity through culturally tailored interventions."
10793903,"Project Summary
Age of puberty is one the most reliable predictors of later mental health outcomes in girls, with early menarche
greatly increasing the risk of depression in early adulthood. Environmental exposure to endocrine disrupting
compounds (EDCs) has been linked with early puberty onset in girls. Despite this, the neurobiological
consequences of EDC exposure, and how they might predispose to depression, remain poorly understood. In a
series of preliminary studies, we showed that peripubertal exposure to a model EDC, bisphenol-A (BPA),
accelerates puberty onset in female rats, and predisposes to behaviors in early adulthood that are reminiscent
of anhedonia, a core symptom of clinical depression. These changes were associated with a persistent
impairment in the functioning of the orexin neuropeptide system, the activity of which is normally important for
translating motivational states into reward behaviors. Specifically, BPA was associated with reduced reactivity
of orexin neurons to reward-predictive stimuli, as well as reduced orexin terminals in ventral tegmental area
(VTA), a key region through which orexins initiate reward-directed actions. Based on these data, we hypothesize
that: at doses that promote early puberty onset, BPA produces a persistent impairment in the functioning of the
orexin-VTA circuit. We predict that these changes are causally linked to the anhedonia-like phenotype observed
in early adulthood in BPA-exposed rats. Here, we propose three distinct, yet interrelated aims to begin testing
our hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will characterize the baseline activity (using electrophysiology) of VTA-projecting
orexin neurons in BPA-exposed rats and determine how this is related to the expression of anhedonia-like
behavior in early adulthood. In Aim 2, we will use fiber photometry recordings of a novel orexin sensor to measure
orexin signaling in VTA in response to reward-predictive stimuli. Finally, in Aim 3, we will use chemogenetics to
stimulate the orexin-VTA circuit to test its causal role in the expression of anhedonia-like behavior following BPA.
These studies will be the first to determine the effect of EDC exposure on orexin neurons and their circuits, and
will determine their mechanistic involvement in depression outcomes in a model of early puberty onset. The
proposed project is thus highly relevant to the goal of NIEHS to understand the impact of environmental chemical
exposures on psychiatric illness. Moreover, these studies are a critical first step for developing novel strategies
to improve mental health outcomes in young women."
10793915,"Project Summary
Listeria monocytogenes (LM) is the causative agent of listeriosis, a fatal foodborne infection in humans and
animals. Invasive form of listeriosis has a mortality rate that ranges from approximately 20%-30% or higher
despite antibiotic treatment. Penicillin or ampicillin are reportedly bacteriostatic for LM infections and require
effective host defense mechanisms for bacterial clearance. New effective strategies for successful treatment of
LM invasive infections are urgently needed. The ability of LM to counteract oxidative stress and reactive
oxygen species (ROS) is essential for survival in phagocytic cells and established infection. However, less is
known regarding how LM manages or detoxifies ROS encountered during systemic infection. The goal of this
proposal is to understand how LM adapts its metabolism and metabolic pathways to alleviate deleterious
effects of oxidative stress and adapt to the host environment. The working hypothesis of this application is
that FruR alters LM metabolism by shifting metabolic flux from glycolysis to PPP, this metabolic switch is
critical for LM’s ability to counteract oxidative stress. This hypothesis will be tested with the following three
specific aims: (Aim 1) Explore whether FruR regulates an LM shift from glycolysis to the PPP to combat
oxidative stress. In this aim, we will use metabolomics analysis to identify glycolysis and PPP metabolites
impacted by FruR upon exposure to oxidative stress. We will also determine the role of FruR in rerouting flux
from glycolysis to PPP using 13C-perturbation. (Aim 2) Determine the role of FruR in generating NADPH and
protecting against host oxidative burst. In this aim, we will verify if the ΔfruR strain could be complemented by
expression of NADPH enzymes. We will investigate the contribution of FruR to LM resistance against ROS
produced by the host respiratory burst. (Aim 3) Decipher the role of the oxidative branch of PPP in resistance
of LM to oxidative stress via regulation of redox status. In this aim, we will determine the role of two NADPH-
producing enzymes in maintaining intracellular redox balance using redox-sensitive green fluorescent protein
(GFP) reporter, roGFP2. This study is innovative because it will test a novel mechanism by which LM
responds to oxidative stress and host respiratory burst. This mechanism involves upregulation of PPP,
focusing on metabolic regulation as a mechanism of LM pathogenesis is a highly innovative approach and
could be widespread among other human pathogens. The proposed project is significant because it will (a)
delineate the role of FruR on protecting LM from oxidative stress and innate host defenses, (b) provide an
opportunity to investigate a new connection between metabolism and virulence, (c) provide a set of metabolic
proteins that could be targeted to develop novel therapeutic agents, and (b) enhance understanding of survival
mechanisms and oxidative stress response of other intracellular pathogens."
10794140,"Abstract
Molecular oxygen (O2) plays a crucial role in shaping Earth's biosphere. It is generally accepted that the rise of
oxygen in the atmosphere led living systems to evolve a sophisticated respiratory chain, which allowed
organisms to harvest energy by oxidative phosphorylation. Oxygen is an indispensable aspect of the eukaryotic
life and is a reactant in many enzymatic reactions beyond oxidative phosphorylation. However, it has frequently
been an overlooked variable in biochemical and cellular studies. Recently, there is increasing evidence that
oxygen tension is a crucial parameter of tissue, cellular and even subcellular metabolism. Oxygen (as O2)
concentrations directly influence physiology, redox signaling, the manifestation of a wide range of pathologies,
as well as developmental and differentiation programs in eukaryotic cells and tissues. A significant obstacle to a
comprehensive understanding of how different O2 tensions control and modulate these phenotypes is the
absence of versatile and reliable technology to monitor oxygen gradients in living cells. This proposal aims to
address this technological gap by developing a protein-based fluorescence biosensor to monitor O2 levels in
mammalian cells. Based on currently available biochemical and structural information, we will engineer
conjugates between naturally occurring heme-based protein scaffolds that bind oxygen reversibly (sensing unit)
and a fluorescent protein UnaG (reporter unit). The sensor constructs will be designed so that the UnaG-based
reporting unit relays and visualizes conformational and absorption changes occurring upon O2 binding within the
heme-based sensing unit. Our approach takes advantage of the fact that maturation of the chromophore of UnaG
is not oxygen dependent and therefore UnaG can be used as a reporter unit at various oxygen tensions.
Biosensor candidates will be rigorously characterized using biochemical, spectroscopic, and imaging
approaches, both as purified recombinant proteins as well as in mammalian cell culture systems. Finally, we will
apply our genetically encoded biosensor to elucidate intracellular O2 concentration dependent metabolic
remodeling in renal cancer cell lines with either intact or deficient von Hippel–Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL)
gene. Overall, the technology we are developing will provide transformative opportunities for understanding the
role of O2 metabolism in cancer and beyond by directly visualizing oxygen gradients at sub-organellar resolution
within living cells."
10794144,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
80% of patients with Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) develop cachexia, which results in dispropor-
tionate skeletal muscle mass loss, relative to caloric deficits. Cachexia causes functional impairment and ineli-
gibility for anti-tumor therapeutic interventions, leading to drastically lower patient quality of life and increased
mortality. Supplemental nutrition is not sufficient to prevent tissue loss, and there is an abject lack of targeted
anti-cachectic therapeutics. This is largely due to an incomplete understanding of how effectors, such as inter-
leukin 6 (IL-6), drive cachexia, and mechanistic studies that poorly reflect the clinical scenarios of PDAC survi-
vorship. Improving the quality of life and survivorship of patients with PDAC requires that we address a funda-
mental knowledge gap in the mechanisms of cachexia persistence after cancer recovery. Our recent work shows
that systemic inflammation in PDAC prevents the liver from adapting to ketogenic metabolism during nutritional
scarcity, which leads to muscle loss. Loss of hepatic signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)
is sufficient to restore ketogenic potential and prevent muscle loss in PDAC mice. This work is the first to show
that improving hepatic fatty acid oxidation prevents cachexia progression. To improve the translation of these
findings we must address two unmet needs: 1) the mechanism of STAT3-driven down regulation of lipid oxidation
and 2) studies that address cachexia recovery in cancer survivors. Based on our prior work, we hypothesize that
STAT3 signaling acts on the liver to induce metabolic changes that persist after cancer recovery, at the detriment
of the muscle. This project is innovative because it uses advanced epigenetic techniques combined with a novel
mouse model of PDAC survivorship to clearly define the epigenetic reprogramming events that persist after
tumor clearance and increase vulnerability of muscle to nutritional stress. The significance of this project lies in
pre-clinical testing of metabolic interventions to protect muscle during PDAC recovery, defining a previously
undescribed action of STAT3 in hepatic metabolism control, and linking long-term metabolic dysfunction to epi-
genetic reprogramming during PDAC cachexia. The long-term goal of our research is to improve the quality of
life, from diagnosis through survivorship, of patients with cancer cachexia through a mechanistic understanding
of inter-organ metabolic events."

Noise exposure damages synaptic connections between cochlear inner hair cells and innervating auditory
nerves. Data from mammalian models and humans indicate that loss of some inner hair cell synapses can be
permanent, leading to the slow degeneration of detached auditory nerves. Yet recent research also supports
that the mammalian cochlea possesses the intrinsic capacity for hair cell synaptic repair following noise
damage. Defining the cellular mechanisms of synapse repair following traumatic noise is a critical step toward
identifying therapeutic targets to promote repair of hair cell synaptic contacts and prevent loss of auditory
nerves.
The overall goal of this proposal is to understand the molecular basis of morphological and functional hair cell
organ repair and recovery following noise-induced damage. Current gaps in our understanding of how hair cell
synapses repair following traumatic noise are in large part due to our inability to define the cellular processes
that promote synaptic repair in mammalian model systems. This project will circumvent these issues by
investigating mechecaniclly induced hair-cell synapse loss and subsequent repair in the zebrafish lateral line—
a mechanosensory organ which is made up of clusters of innervated hair cells. Zebrafish lateral-line hair cells
are comparable to mammalian hair cells at the molecular and cellular level, including a shared mechanism of
hair cell synapse loss and de-innervation following traumatic overstimulation. Yet lateral line hair cells rapidly
and unambiguously repair lost synaptic connections within hours following stimulus-induced damage. Aim 1 of
our proposal will test the hypothesis that hair cell activity governs synaptic repair, while Aim 2 will define the
contribution of inflammation to synaptic recovery and reinnervation. The results of each of our Aims will provide
information on how hair cell synaptic connections are restored following traumatic overstimulation and will help
identify strategies to promote endogenous repair in noise exposed cochlea, thereby preventing subsequent
auditory nerve degeneration and hearing loss."

 Genomic variants in an individual may be either inherited (i.e., transmitted through the germline) or
generated by mutagenesis in post-zygotic cells. Widespread genomic mosaicism in somatic cells of
phenotypically normal individuals is now well established. In certain cases, it is known that mutations have
causative role in diseases and contribute to neuropsychiatric disorders. But generally, little is known about to
what extent natural mosaicism influences an individual’s susceptibility to disease.
 In our recent study we discovered a phenomenon of hypermutability in adult brains. Hypermutability was
not related to diagnosis but increased with age, reaching at least 3% population frequency (95% confidence
interval) for brains over 40 years old. The phenomenon of hypermutability could have implications for a number
of conditions. Since it correlates with aging, it could be important for age-related neurodegenerative diseases;
or, as it involves mutations in cancer-related genes, it may be related to predisposition for brain cancer.
Alternatively, hypermutability may reflect imbalances (expansion/contraction) between cell lineages in the
developing brain.
 We have three hypotheses explaining hypermutability. The goal of the proposed study is to firmly
establish the origin(s) of hypermutability. To conduct the study, we will first expand the set of hypermutable
brains (Aim 1). The ultimate judgement about the origins will be made from the regional distribution and
frequency of mutations in the brains (Aim 2), the cell type(s) carrying the mutations (Aim 3), and proving (or
disproving) that mutations in the hypermutable brains arose from a clonally expanded cell lineage (Aim 4).
Proving the hypothesized origins of hypermutability will be a fundamental contribution to understanding brain
development and aging in humans and will lay the foundation for future studies of the underlying mechanisms."
10801608,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Azithromycin mass drug administration (MDA) to children 1-59 months old reduces child mortality and is being
considered for inclusion in child survival programs. However, azithromycin MDA leads to emergence of
antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The World Health Organization (WHO) thus suggests azithromycin MDA be
limited to children 1-11 months old to reduce the risk of AMR. Several high mortality West African countries
have since initiated azithromycin MDA, though key questions about its impact on AMR remain. In particular,
the impact of long-term selection pressure is not well understood – trachoma studies treating all ages found
that AMR continues to increase with additional distributions, but studies treating only children suggest that
resistance may plateau after an initial increase. Understanding AMR patterns with long-term MDA is essential
to define the duration of future programs. In addition, spillover of AMR from treated to untreated groups is
plausible, though has yet to be demonstrated in this context. If present, the risks of AMR with this intervention
may be greater than anticipated. Similarly, previous studies on the impact of azithromycin MDA on co-selection
for resistance in non-macrolide antibiotic classes have had mixed results. The emergence of co-selection with
azithromycin MDA would amplify the risks of this intervention as well, threatening the efficacy of other essential
antibiotics. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation-funded AVENIR trial is a large trial that randomizes more than
3,000 communities in Niger to 4 years of biannual MDA of 1) azithromycin to 1-11-month-olds with placebo to
12-59-month-olds, 2) azithromycin to 1-59-month-olds, or 3) placebo to 1-59-month-olds. AVENIR’s primary
endpoints are mortality and AMR compared across the 3 arms. The trial will also collect rectal and
nasopharyngeal samples from several treated and untreated groups in 150 communities after 2 and 4 years of
distributions. In addition, AVENIR includes a subset of communities that received 5 years of azithromycin MDA
in a prior study, resulting in very long-term distributions between the two studies. This presents a unique
opportunity to study key questions beyond the scope of the main trial but essential to understanding how MDA
drives community AMR. Our large sample size enables adequate power to elucidate the relationship between
antibiotic use and population-level AMR emergence, including long-term effects, spillover effects to non-target
groups, and co-selection in other antibiotic classes. Moreover, this project proposes metagenomic deep
sequencing to characterize the respiratory and gut resistome in order to complement the proposed phenotypic
AMR monitoring. We propose to leverage this trial-based infrastructure, large sample bank, and our lab’s high-
throughput genomic approaches to provide evidence to directly impact mass azithromycin programs and the
WHO guidelines on this intervention."
10931629,"PROJECT ABSTRACT:
Rising rates of injection drug use in the United States have led to a crisis of serious injection-related infections
(SIRI) affecting people who inject drugs (PWID), such as endocarditis, osteomyelitis, and spinal abscess. SIRI
are associated with high severity and mortality, often needing long hospitalizations, and need for intensive
health services. Addiction treatment interventions, such as addiction specialty consultation or initiation of
medications for opioid use disorder, have shown benefit in smaller studies and in commercially insured
populations. Evidence generated in Medicaid populations is needed to inform Medicaid program policies. In
this proposal, our overall objective is to comprehensively understand addiction treatment delivery for patients
with SIRI, including variation and disparities in treatment intervention delivery, and the associations of those
interventions with clinical and economic outcomes. Specifically, we aim to 1) Use national Medicaid
administrative data from 2015-21 to determine if delivery of addiction treatment interventions to PWID
hospitalized with SIRI is associated with clinical and economic outcomes, 2) how hospital- and area-level
capacity to provide addiction treatment explains the variation in treatment delivery, and 3) use qualitative
methods to determine the factors that promote or hinder addiction treatment interventions in hospital settings.
To improve outcomes for PWID with SIRI, we first need to understand the current landscape of healthcare
delivery, and the motivating factors that will transform healthcare practices to better meet the needs of PWID.
Understanding the gaps in evidence-based healthcare delivery for SIRI in the United States are critical first
steps for implementing system change to improve care for PWID with SIRI."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a major leading cause of death in the developed world and there are few preventative
or disease-modifying treatments. Genetics and cell biology point to deficiencies in the endo-lysosomal network
as a driving factor in AD pathogenesis. Therefore, this proposal is in response to NOSI (NOT-AG-21-034):
Genetic Underpinnings of Endosomal Trafficking as a Pathological Hub in AD/ADRD. We will use human
induced pluripotent cell lines (hiPSC) and patient tissue to define how endo-lysosomal dysfunction impacts cell-
type specific functions and how high genetic burden of risk in endo-lysosomal pathways manifests in the AD
brain.
In Aims 1 and 2 we will perform experiments in neurons and microglia harboring AD-associated variants in the
endosomal gene SORL1. SORL1 is a highly pathogenic AD risk gene and mutations in SORL1 that lead to
haploinsufficiency are considered causal for AD. SORL1 is also a strong risk factor late onset AD. The protein
product of the SORL1 gene, SORL1/SORLA interacts with the multi-protein sorting complex retromer to traffic
various cargo essential for cellular function. Understanding the impact of SORL1-retromer trafficking in diverse
cell types of the central nervous system is essential to determine whether this is a valid therapeutic pathway. We
will differentiate neurons and microglia from hiPSCs harboring AD-associated variants in SORL1, along with
isogenic controls. In these cells we will perform assays to specifically interrogate neuronal and microglial
functions that rely on efficient endo-lysosomal trafficking. For neurons we will test neuronal synaptic function and
analysis of protein-protein interactions at the neuronal synapse. For microglia we will test phagocytosis,
lysosomal degradation, receptor recycling and cytokine levels. In both cell types, we will test whether aberrant
phenotypes can be rescued by using small molecules that enhance retromer function and by genetically
expressing specific components of the SORL1-retromer pathway.
For Aim 3 we have also generated a cohort of patient-derived hiPSC lines from late onset AD subjects and
controls and matched brain tissue stratified by polygenic risk in the endo-lysosomal network (ePRS). We will
analyze endo-lysosomal phenotypes in brain tissue as well as in neural cells differentiated from the matched
hiPSC lines. We will test whether rescue of ELN trafficking via the SORL1-retromer pathway will also be
beneficial in these cell lines. These experiments will significantly advance knowledge in this area by generating
patient-specific data on global gene expression and morphology in a cohort representative of the genomes of at-
risk individuals. These experiments will also be critical in determining whether this pathway can be a strong
target for AD therapeutic development."
10808092,"ABSTRACT
One in five Americans has chronic pain. Many pharmacological pain interventions exist but increase risk of opioid
abuse. There is a critical need to find safe, accessible, and effective treatments for patients to self-manage pain.
Neurofeedback, or electroencephalogram (EEG) biofeedback, treats pain by training patients to regulate brain
states linked to physiological relaxation. Although neurofeedback has traditionally required travel to clinics, in
the past decade, portable EEG headsets have been validated that read brainwaves and send signals via
Bluetooth to mobile devices. We developed a mobile health (mHealth) platform enabling patients with chronic
pain to conduct neurofeedback at home to self-manage pain. Patients with chronic pain, most with low back pain,
were able to conduct mobile neurofeedback independently, and after three months of use, reported significantly
lower pain intensity and lower pain interference. In the current R01 application, we will conduct a double-blind
randomized controlled trial to test the effects of mobile neurofeedback on pain outcomes. N=150 adults with
chronic low back pain will be randomly assigned to mobile neurofeedback or a placebo-control condition. Each
participant will receive a portable EEG headset and mobile device outfitted with a mobile application (app) called
‘Mobile Neurofeedback’ and be asked to complete 10-minute sessions at least 4 days per week for 12 weeks.
The experimental condition involves a mobile app that provides auditory feedback signaling EEG alpha power
above a threshold level and denoting a physiologically relaxed state. The control condition involves a visually
identical mobile app yoked to a pre-recorded set of actual neurofeedback sessions (i.e., placebo). Data will be
collected at 0, 3, 6, and 9 months. We hypothesize that participants randomized to the experimental condition
will show greater decrease in pain intensity and pain interference and greater increase in speed on a test of
physical function and EEG alpha power at 3, 6, and 9 months compared to participants in the control condition.
We also hypothesize that pain self-efficacy will mediate changes in pain outcomes among participants
randomized to the experimental condition. This research is innovative because it tests a novel mHealth tool that
uniquely enables self-management of pain to be performed easily and safely by patients. This study advances
the field by rigorously testing effectiveness of a cutting-edge, practical mHealth tool to improve quality of life for
patients with chronic low back pain. Mobile neurofeedback enables patients to be active participants in managing
their own health and therefore shows promise to reduce clinic visits. The expected outcome is development of a
portable, low-cost, non-pharmacological intervention pioneering a new framework to treat pain. By applying
mHealth technology to a self-management pain treatment, this study furthers strategic goals of NINR and the
NIH National Pain Strategy. If this study yields positive results, it would demonstrate that mobile neurofeedback
has potential to fundamentally change patients’ ability to effectively self-manage chronic pain."

Heart failure is defined as the inability of cardiac output to meet demand. Moreover, heart failure causes
significant morbidity and mortality, affecting over 6 million Americans, with ~50% mortality at five years despite
current pharmacologic and device-based therapies. Cardiac hypertrophy, defined as an increase in
cardiomyocyte size and heart muscle mass, leads to maladaptive remodeling and is a significant precursor of
heart failure. Thus, intervening early during cardiac hypertrophy has the potential to improve the health and
outcomes of patients. For decades, investigations have characterized individual intracellular molecular
regulators of cardiac hypertrophy; however, effective clinical therapies specifically targeting cardiac hypertrophy
remain elusive. We aim to overcome the past obstacles of focusing on a single signaling molecule by employing
a systems approach that considers the more extensive network of signaling interactions and FDA-approved
drugs that are viable candidates for drug repurposing. Our overall goal is to identify drugs and network
mechanisms as therapeutic targets to control cardiac hypertrophy. To achieve this goal, we will test the overall
hypothesis that a systems pharmacology network model can accurately predict the context-dependent effects of
drugs on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in vitro and in vivo. In Specific Aim 1, we will apply a systems pharmacology
model to predict drugs and drug combinations that cause context-dependent regulation of cardiomyocyte
hypertrophy. We will develop a computational model that integrates the cardiomyocyte signaling network with
the pharmacologic mechanisms of FDA-approved drugs. We will then use this model to predict the drug
combinations and network mechanisms that inhibit cardiomyocyte hypertrophy under distinct environmental
contexts. In Specific Aim 2, we will validate our model predictions of candidate drugs using cultured rat and
human cardiomyocytes to test the context-dependent inhibition of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. In Specific Aim 3,
we will translate the model and cell-based experimental data to in vivo mouse models of cardiac hypertrophy
and determine whether the modeling accurately predicts the effects of drugs in a context-dependent manner.
Overall, these studies will establish a systems pharmacology model, new computational insights into how drugs
modulate cardiac hypertrophy, and a wealth of new experimental data that will validate these predictions."
10808098,"The dentate gyrus (DG) is one of two brain regions acknowledged to sustain neural stem cells (NSCs)
continuously producing neurons (termed “neurogenesis”) beyond development. Newborn neurons produced in
the DG are involved in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory. Thus, factors regulating establishment
of the NSC pool during development and their life-long maintenance are crucial for hippocampal function.
 The fate of NSCs is governed by local microenvironmental factors, including neural circuit activity.
Hyperexcitation in the hippocampus caused by epileptic seizures aberrantly increases neurogenesis in the
adult DG, leading to consumption of many NSCs and results in exhaustion of the NSC pool. Despite
accumulating evidence that neuronal activity regulates NSCs dynamics, still little is known about the
responsible niche cells and signaling molecules connecting neural activity and NSC dynamics. Similar to the
adult DG, NSCs in the developing DG may also be influenced by activity, but whether NSCs are regulated by
early neural activity during circuit establishment in the developing DG has not been directly addressed.
In the previous funding cycle for this grant, we found that Shh is a key niche signal for the initial production of
specialized NSCs populating the DG and for their postnatal expansion to establish the size of the NSC pool for
later adult neurogenesis. In more recent preliminary data we have found that Shh signaling is upregulated after
seizures in the adult DG and that seizure-induced aberrant neurogenesis is attenuated in Shh deficient mice.
We previously showed that Shh is produced from excitatory neurons in the dentate hilus (mossy cells) but have
now extended this to show that mossy cell activity enhances neurogenesis. On this basis we have formulated
the hypothesis (for Aim 1) that Shh derived from mossy cells is crucial for neuronal activity induced DG
neurogenesis. We have also investigated the neuronal circuit in the developing DG and found that the entorhinal
cortex projection to the developing DG is established by the first postnatal week coinciding with the appearance
of quiescent NSCs in the DG. We have also found that NSCs receive direct inputs from local neurons in the
developing DG in this same period. Based on these preliminary results we formulated a second hypothesis (for
Aim 2) that development of cortex-dentate-NSCs circuits and their activity control the proliferation state and
transition to quiescence of NSCs in the developing DG."
10807211,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Kidney disease is a major contributor of death in the U.S. Chronic inflammation is common among
individuals with chronic kidney disease. A diet high in salt or low in potassium is associated with
increased inflammation and kidney injury. The renal handling of salt and potassium within distal
segments of the nephron is linked to the circadian clock. Recently, distal segment cells have been
linked to initiating tubulointerstitial inflammation. The research goal is to determine the
mechanistic links between BMAL1 and activation of the immune system within distal segment
cells of the kidney. Preliminary data identifies BMAL1 as a driver of inflammation in the kidney in
response to a low K+/high salt diet, leading to kidney injury. Studies will use novel conditional
knockout mouse models to reduce expression and re-express BMAL1 specifically in distal
segment cells. The first aim will test the hypothesis that mice with decreased BMAL1 expression
within distal segments display lower immune mediated kidney damage in response to low
potassium with high salt diet. The second aim will test the hypothesis that BMAL1 within distal
segments stimulates pro-inflammatory cytokine production in mice fed a low K+/high salt diet. To
test these hypotheses, experiments to determine the localization and extent of renal injury,
cytokine/chemokine production, immune cell recruitment and activation in response to a low
K+/high salt diet are planned. These studies will establish a novel line of investigation aimed at
understanding the link between the clock gene BMAL1 and activation of the immune system in
the kidney. The long term goal of this work is to The training plan was carefully designed to build
upon career development skills of the project leader focused around research advancement,
education, and service to the scientific community. The experiments and career development will
take place at the University of Florida, a top ten public research university that provides an
outstanding environment for conducting biomedical research. Together, data from this award will
provide a foundation for identifying new targets to treat renal inflammation/injury in order to
improve the quality of life in individuals with kidney disease. The mentored training plan will
provide the project leader with necessary technical and professional skills training needed to
become an independent investigator."
10811581,"PROJECT SUMMARY. Synaptic integration and plasticity are the cellular mechanisms of information pro-
cessing, learning, and memory. How these fundamental processes are disrupted in epilepsy is not understood.
Generalized Epilepsy with Febrile Seizures Plus/Dravet syndrome (GEFS+/DS) is a spectrum of epilepsy disor-
ders linked to mutations of the SCN1B gene which cause seizures, neurodevelopmental delays, and early death.
To develop treatments for seizures/cognitive deficits of GEFS+/DS epilepsies, there is a critical need to identify
mechanisms by which SCN1B mutations disrupt cellular-level information processing and learning. Our long-
term goal is to define general principles linking genes to disrupted synaptic integration and plasticity in such
neurodevelopmental disorders. The overall objective of our proposal is to define how the interplay between syn-
apses, dendritic physiology, and somatic physiology impair synaptic integration and plasticity in the Scn1b knock-
out (KO) mouse model of GEFS+/DS. Our central hypothesis is loss of Scn1b dysregulates ion channels and
dendrite excitability, disturbing integration and plasticity. To test this hypothesis, we will complete three Aims:
 Aim 1: Determine the mechanisms of somatic and dendritic hyperexcitability in Scn1b KO neurons.
Based on preliminary data, our hypothesis is that both dendrites and somata of Scn1b KO CA1 pyramidal neu-
rons exhibit intrinsic hyperexcitability in part due to abnormal HCN channel activity. We will test this hypothesis
with whole cell somatic and dendritic recordings, immunohistochemistry, and cell morphology analyses.
 Aim 2: Determine the mechanisms of altered synaptic integration in Scn1b KO neurons. Based on our
preliminary data, our hypothesis is that loss of Scn1b fundamentally alters the translation of inputs into outputs,
with both temporal and spatial synaptic integration abnormally enhanced due to dendritic hyperexcitability and
disrupted synaptic physiology. We will use whole cell recordings to test how temporal and spatial features of
input/output functions are altered in Scn1b KO neurons in response to naturalistic patterns of synaptic inputs.
 Aim 3: Test the hypothesis that Scn1b disruption alters synaptic learning rules and gating by GABA
that dictate plasticity. Based on our preliminary data, our hypothesis is that synaptic learning rules governing
LTP and LTD induction are re-shaped due to interplay between suppressed excitation, hyperexcitable intrinsic
properties, and abnormal gating by aberrant depolarizing inhibition after loss of Scn1b. We will test how input
patterns that evoke LTP and LTD shift after loss of Scn1b, and how inhibition influences this plasticity.
 Upon successful completion of the proposed research, we will have defined detailed mechanisms by which
changes in neuron intrinsic and synaptic physiology and their interactions re-shape the cellular forms of neural
processing and learning in the Scn1b KO mouse model of GEFS+/DS. This contribution will provide mechanistic
links between genetic changes, primary neurophysiology phenotypes, and neuronal processing deficits underly-
ing seizures and the learning, memory, and cognition impairments in GEFS+/DS epilepsies."

The toll of spinal cord injury on people and society is substantial, and particularly so when hand function
is impaired and independence lost. We use well defined spinal cord injury (SCI) models in nonhuman
primates and rodents to delineate the responses of major ascending and descending tracts, that
reorganize post-injury and that mediate the recovery of hand function. Our past work shows that spinal
injuries that remove sensory input from the opposing digits, can cause an initial deficit in hand function,
from which monkeys recover over weeks and months post-lesion. This recovery occurs despite the
permanent loss of most of the original sensory innervation to the hand. We have shown that spared
primary motor (M1) and somatosensory (S1) cortical subdivisions of the corticospinal tract (CST) sprout
extensively and bilaterally beyond their normal terminal territory within the cord following a
deafferentation injury, but only when the injury involves the central nervous system. Similar responses
can be demonstrated in rats which indicates the response is robust and conserved across mammalian
species. In this grant, we will address some major gaps that remain in our understanding of the
recovery process. We will do this by determining what happens at the neuronal circuit level, at the
periphery, and following a more clinically relevant lesion involving both sensory and motor components.
Our main focus is on monkeys, where our findings are directly translational, and on sub-chronic and
chronic time points following injury. These are times when patients are more accessible to intervention,
and the chronic time point in particular is poorly understood. Our specific aims in summary are as
follows: 1. What happens to the central neuronal circuitry following a deafferentation injury? Here we
will target the major inputs to the spinal cord (from the hand and cortex) and their connections, to
assess how they reorganize to mediate the recovery of hand function. 2. How do peripheral nerves and
receptors compensate for lost innervation to support significant recovery of sensation in the hand? 3.
How does the addition of a small motor component to our lesion model, alter the recovery process and
underlying connections? The lesion models to be used are particularly well defined, and involve
peripheral and central, as well as sensory and motor components, which makes them clinically relevant.
We use behavioral, electrophysiological, and a range of neuroanatomical techniques (including high
resolution confocal microscopy), as well as powerful multifactorial statistical modeling to assess
changes. Our findings will improve our understanding of the changes that occur in clinical injuries, and
better enable the future development of effective treatments for people with spinal cord injury. Findings
will be set in a broader context of behavioral recovery and system wide neuronal responses."

The primary aim of this new University of Colorado transdisciplinary training program is to prepare outstanding
pre-(PhD) and post-(PhD, MD/PhD, MD) doctoral fellows for science careers that address cutting-edge basic
and clinical research questions that represent the future of biomedical research. The training program will
foster transdisciplinary research with state-of-the-art technologies and methods used by participating faculty
laboratories, and will evaluate and enhance the mentoring skills of early career faculty. The program is novel in
that it exposes trainees and faculty from diverse biomedical research backgrounds to collaborative sleep and
circadian science. Similarly, current sleep and circadian trainees and expert faculty benefit from meaningful
interactions with investigators from different research backgrounds, particularly those from biomedical research
areas that are of high importance to the NIH/NHLBI. The research training activities of the 22 participating
faculty emphasize transdisciplinary training in sleep and circadian physiology with research programs focused
on cardiovascular, genetics/genomics, metabolomics, proteomics, biomarker development, bioinformatics,
biostatistics, epidemiology, stress physiology, immunology, endocrinology, metabolism, obesity, diabetes,
neuroscience, pediatrics, development, aging, psychiatry, and pulmonary and behavioral sleep medicine.
Because our goal is to provide transdisciplinary and translational research career training, major program
components of this T32 include the Department of Integrative Physiology, the Department of Psychology and
Neuroscience, and the Institute for Behavioral Genetics at University of Colorado Boulder, and multiple clinical
departments and divisions at University of Colorado School of Medicine Anschutz Medical Campus. The
existing fruitful and collaborative environment is a strength of this training grant. Of the existing T32s at the
University of Colorado, this would be the only one dedicated to transdisciplinary sleep and circadian science.
Also, it would become the first sleep and circadian T32 in the Western United States.
The specific aims of the training program are to recruit, select and retain outstanding trainees; promote
inclusive excellence; provide high quality training, educational, and career development experiences to prepare
trainees for research-intensive and research-related careers; shape tomorrow’s scientific leaders; foster
rigorous and collaborative sleep and circadian science; ensure successful progress of trainees toward
predetermined milestones defined in Individual Development Plans; enhance the mentoring skills of faculty
through a formal mentoring training plan; ensure conscientious program evaluation; and expand the number of
investigators conducting transdisciplinary sleep and circadian science. We request support for one pre-doctoral
and one post-doctoral trainee in year 1, and two pre-doctoral and two post-doctoral trainees in years 2-5."

Title: Synthesizing Image-derived Heterogeneity with Genomic Measurements for Assessing Disease
Aggressiveness in Lower Grade Gliomas
WHO Grade II low grade gliomas (LGGs) are a type of brain tumor with an average incidence of 1/100,000
person-years within the population. Approximately 4000 people are diagnosed with this disease each year. It
has been observed that even after the first line of therapy (surgery, chemo-radiation), this disease inevitably
recurs. Further, it eventually transforms to a higher grade (WHO Grade III/IV) over time, a process referred to as
malignant transformation (MT). Even though MT is almost inevitable, the time-to-MT can be quite variable. In
aggressive cases, the LGG can undergo MT quite early in disease course, while in other (less aggressive) cases,
the duration to MT is much longer. This variability in time-to-MT can spell very disparate prognoses for the
patient. Such uncertainty in the disease evolution of LGGs also creates significant challenges for treatment man-
agement. Apart from creating uncertainty for the oncologist as how to appropriately manage the disease, this
also creates an anxiety-ridden scenario for the patients and their caregivers who try to understand their individual
condition. A rational strategy to understand and characterize the aggressiveness of LGGs can provide valuable
insight into the appropriate approach of treatment and surveillance for these patients.
In this proposal, we will address three specific aims that build a comprehensive, integrative statistical model,
which incorporates novel, complex imaging predictors, in addition to standard clinical and genomic characteris-
tics, for informing time-to-malignant transformation of LGGs. This tool can provide an assessment of anticipated
disease course that will help the patient and physician make suitable treatment decisions as well as to design
appropriate monitoring methods to track the progression and status of the tumor. Such a tool can also help
ameliorate some of the uncertainty and anxiety for the patients and their caregivers who will be better equipped
to understand their individual disease, in addition to enabling a more effective collaboration between patient and
physician to determine the most appropriate treatment approach. In particular, we will develop novel tumor het-
erogeneity objects, which efficiently capture inter- and intra-tumor variation in morphology and intensity-distribu-
tion characteristics. These objects are functional in nature and lie on nonlinear spaces. This introduces a signif-
icant challenge in statistical analysis such as defining association measures between the tumor heterogeneity
objects and genomic covariates, or incorporating these objects as predictors in an integrative statistical model.
To address these goals, we will use data on WHO Grade II LGG patients treated at the University of Texas MD
Anderson Cancer Center to identify imaging, genomic and clinical characteristics of malignant transformation.
This dataset is unique because, aside from imaging (radiographic) and genomic information, there is carefully
curated clinical data about the disease course of every patient (such as overall survival and time-to-malignant
transformation)."
10812216,"Summary
Glycosyltransferases generate covalent glycosidic linkages that include post-translational modifications to the
vast majority of secreted and cell surface glycoproteins. Mammalian sialyltransferases are a highly conserved
family of glycosyltransferases that attach sialic acids at distal and terminal positions during glycan synthesis
mostly as a2-3 and a2-6 anomeric linkages. Sialic acid linkages can form ligands of various receptors including
the Siglec receptors of immune cells. Siglecs bind sialic acids in cis and trans at cell surfaces thereby
controlling the assembly and signaling of immune cell receptor complexes. For example, Siglec binding to cell
surface sialic acid linkages induces immunological tolerance with the induction of B lymphocyte anergy and
apoptosis, which can block autoantibody induction and inhibit the onset of lupus-like autoimmune disease in
mouse models. The pathogenesis of autoimmune disease reflects defects in immunological tolerance but
remains poorly understood. Most mammalian cell surfaces are covered with glycoproteins bearing sialylated
asparagine-linked (N)-glycans. Unexpectedly, we have observed low levels of sialyltransferase expression and
sialic acids among normal mouse and human pancreatic beta cells. This intrinsically low level of sialylation
limits the expression of Siglec ligands and may be disadvantageous in the presence of a dysfunctional
hyperactive immune system. In Type 1 diabetes (T1D), a defect in immunological tolerance results in the
destruction of pancreatic beta cells. Although dysregulation of the immune system is believed to represent the
origin of this disease, the reason why pancreatic beta cells are targeted is not known. This research proposal is
focused on a unique hypothesis reinforced by significant supporting data that the susceptibility of pancreatic
beta cells to immunological attack in autoimmune diabetes reflects low levels of toleragenic sialic acids. To
identify the mechanistic features of immunological tolerance to pancreatic beta cells, we have initially studied
the Non-Obese Diabetic ShiLT/J (NOD) mouse because of its well-defined disease signs that include
spontaneous insulitis progressing to beta cell destruction, insulin deficiency and diabetes, and because of the
large body of immunological knowledge that has been acquired using this model of human T1D. We have
generated and analyzed transgenic syngeneic NOD mice bearing increased expression of sialic acids on
pancreatic beta cell glycoproteins. Remarkably, augmentation of sialic acid linkages protects NOD mice from
insulitis and the immunological destruction of pancreatic beta cells. The research proposed herein will compare
disease protection afforded by transgenic sialyltransferase expression augmenting a2-3 and a2-6 sialic acid
linkages and Siglec ligands in NOD beta cells, and complete transplant studies to gain mechanistic insights of
how sialic acids participate in immunological tolerance. Discovering the roles of glycosyltransferases in tissue-
specific autoimmunity will enhance the understanding of immunological tolerance mechanisms and is likely to
aid in the development of preventative and curative approaches to autoimmune diseases such as T1D."

methodological gaps exist that limit the accuracy of Lp(a) measurements at the both the clinical laboratory
and clinical level. The major limitation is the lack of widely available, globally standardized, diagnostic
methods, and specifically monoclonal antibodies that bind only once to Lp(a) that can be used to accurately
quantitate Lp(a). This lack of standardization may have adverse clinical sequalae by mis-assigning Lp(a) risk
thresholds or targets for therapy. Due to the limitations noted above, the FDA has yet to approve any Lp(a)
assay in molar concentration. The NHLBI Working Group on Lp(a) organized 2 workshops in 2017 and 2019
and recommended constructive collaboration among all stakeholders to ensure standardization and
harmonization of Lp(a) assays and to develop assays that are isoform independent using monoclonal
antibodies that are specific to one site on apo(a). To address these gaps in the care of patients with elevated
Lp(a), we propose the following specific aims: 1- to develop and validate an isoform independent Lp(a) assay
with a recently generated isoform-independent, monoclonal antibody; 2- to generate a second, isoform-
independent, monoclonal antibody to facilitate the development of a first, isoform-independent non-ELISA
methodology adaptable to hospitals and commercial laboratories. We will collaborate with the CDC/IFCC to
validate this new ELISA at the clinical laboratory interface; and 3- to apply these novel assays to clinical
datasets for translatability to human disease, including studies of racial/ethnic differences, antisense Lp(a)-
lowering therapy and in CVD outcome studies."
10814877,"The incidence of the pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (PNETs) has increased over the past two
decades. The principal treatment for localized PNETs is surgical resection; however, there is no effective
therapy for patients with advanced unresectable or metastatic disease. The progression-free survival rate is at
the best 11 months with FDA approved agent Everolimus compared to 4.6 months with the placebo. However,
the majority of the patients develop drug resistance and there is a void in our understanding of the
mechanisms of resistance in PNETs. Frequent mutations in MEN1 (44%), DAXX/ATRX (43%), mTOR (15%)
pathway genes and Von Hippel Lindau disease (VHL) alongside several other hereditary disorders are
observed in PNETs. Loss of VHL has been linked to enhanced tumor aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect). In
this scenario, cancer cells rely more heavily on Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD) pool that is a crucial
co-factor in the redox reactions of metabolic pathways of cancer cells with high aerobic glycolysis. This over-
dependence on NAD may provide actionable therapeutic avenues within the NAD salvage pathway. Our
preliminary studies in PNET cell lines and patient derived tissue demonstrate activation of VHL regulated NAD
biosynthesis rate-limiting enzyme Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) alongside the over-
expression of the mTOR promoter p21 activated kinase 4 (PAK4). PAK4 protein by virtue of its ability to
engage multiple ligands has been shown to regulate a repertoire of signaling pathways including PNET
resistance molecules. Significantly, PAK4-NAMPT dual RNAi suppressed proliferation in PNET cell lines. The
CRISPR/Cas9 validated PAK4-NAMPT dual inhibitor KPT-9274 (a Phase I drug) shows antitumor activity in
vitro, in PNET xenograft and could synergistically enhance the cytotoxicity of Everolimus. Molecular analysis of
combination treatment showed down-regulation of known Everolimus resistance promoter suppression of ATP
and NAD. Normal cells can utilize Nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase (NAPRT1, an enzyme often absent in
tumors due to promoter methylation) to generate NAD through nicotinic acid. Therefore, nicotinic acid co-
treatment can allow KPT-9274 dose escalation without undue toxicity to normal tissue. We hypothesize that
targeting of PAK4-NAMPT signaling could become a broad and clinically viable therapeutic strategy for PNET.
Aim1: Profile the PAK4 and NAMPT aberrations in PNET patient tissue. Aim 2: Demonstrate the role of PAK4-
NAMPT in PNET therapy resistance. Aim 3: Demonstrate the preclinical in vivo efficacy of PAK4-NAMPT dual
inhibitors in PNET xenograft and define a biomarker of therapeutic response in biopsies from an ongoing
Phase I trial. Clinical impact: Our studies will enhance the fundamental understanding of PAK signaling and
NAD metabolism in PNET subsistence. This work will also uncover the ideal patient population based on their
NAPRT status for best treatment response. Our preclinical studies will lead to the development of a novel
tailored regimen for therapy-resistant and by far incurable PNETs."

Mass spectrometry is an extraordinarily powerful bioanalytical technique that has
had a profound impact on our molecular understanding of human health and
disease. Major advances in mass analyzer technology, dissociation techniques,
lasers, and ionization methods are largely attributed to the central role that mass
spectrometry plays in the field of systems biology. While mass spectrometry has
evolved over the last century into a highly effective analytical tool, there remain
significant opportunities for innovation, allowing an even more diverse array of
biological questions to be addressed. This proposal is centered on the
development of new ionization methods for biological mass spectrometry to
enable tissue imaging across several classes of biological molecules. The short-
term objective of this proposal is to further develop and fundamentally
understand this innovative ionization method using real biological systems.
These results will provide a solid foundation from which biological applications
will directly benefit. In this mindset, we will develop and apply these new
ionization methods to tissue imaging in model organisms to gain mechanistic
insights into, 1) ischemic stroke; 2) wound healing; and 3) cardiometabolic
disease. The long-term objective is to establish these new ionization methods as
an enabling bioanalytical technology to effectively address questions in human
health and disease.
Public Description of Proposed Research
Mass spectrometry (MS), the science related to the “weighing of molecules”, has
had a profound impact on the study of human health and disease including
cancer, heart disease, neurodegenerative diseases, neural development, and
auto-immune diseases. A prerequisite of MS is to convert neutral molecules into
charged species (ions) such that they can be “weighed” by the mass
spectrometer and identified by advanced analytical techniques. The focus of this
research is to develop new ionization methods allowing a more diverse array of
contemporary biomedical questions to be addressed. This will include the
imaging of tissues to ultimately provide new biological insights into stroke, wound
healing and cardiometabolic disease."

Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) is the largest long-term study of brain development and child
health in the United States. The ABCD Research Consortium consists of 21 research sites across the country,
a Coordinating Center, and a Data Analysis and Informatics Resource Center. In its first five years, under
RFA-DA-15-015, ABCD enrolled a diverse sample of 11,878 9-10 year olds from across the consortium, and
will track their biological and behavioral development through adolescence into young adulthood.
All participants received a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging,
neuropsychological testing, bioassays, careful assessment of substance use, mental health, physical health,
and culture and environment. A similar detailed assessment recurs every 2 years. Interim in-person annual
interviews and mid-year telephone or mobile app assessments provide refined temporal resolution of
developmental changes and life events that occur over time with minimal burden to participating youth and
parents. Intensive efforts are made to keep the vast majority of participants involved with the study through
adolescence and beyond, and retention rates thus far are very high. Neuroimaging has expanded our
understanding of brain development from childhood into adulthood. Using this and other cutting-edge
technologies, ABCD can determine how different kinds of youth experiences (such as sports, school
involvement, extracurricular activities, videogames, social media, unhealthy sleep patterns, and vaping)
interact with each other and with a child's changing biology to affect brain development and social, behavioral,
academic, health, and other outcomes.
Data, securely and privately shared with the scientific community, will enable investigators to: (1) describe
individual developmental pathways in terms of neural, cognitive, emotional, and academic functioning, and
influencing factors; (2) develop national standards of healthy brain development; (3) investigate the roles and
interaction of genes and the environment on development; (4) examine how physical activity, sleep, screen
time, sports injuries (including traumatic brain injuries), and other experiences influence brain development; (5)
determine and replicate factors that influence mental health from childhood to young adulthood; (6)
characterize relationships between mental health and substance use; and (7) specify how use of substances
such as cannabis, alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine affects developmental outcomes, and how neural, cognitive,
emotional, and environmental factors influence the risk for adolescent substance use."
10931745,"Project Summary/Abstract
Minnesota HealthSolutions Corporation (MHS) proposes to develop a child safety seat with a novel intuitive
harness tensioning system to improve the rate of proper harnessing of children into child safety seats. Children are
harnessed into child safety seats via a 5-point harness with shoulder straps that buckle at the crotch. The entire
harness assembly must be properly tensioned to ensure safety. Loose harnesses are a common misuse in child
safety seats. Several large studies have observed that only 10% to 20% of children are correctly harnessed into
correctly installed seats. Improper use of child restraints substantially reduces their effectiveness and is a major
public health concern. The proposed child safety seat will utilize an all mechanical, intuitive system to improve
proper use of the child safety seat harness. We hypothesize that a child safety seat that provides an intuitive and
easy-to-use harness system will significantly improve the rate of proper child safety seat usage and reduce vehicle
crash-related child injuries and deaths. An interdisciplinary team of researchers has been assembled to define,
build, and evaluate a prototype system."

Many mammalian organs with high cellular turnover (e.g. skin, intestine and blood) are composed of short-lived
cells that require continuous replenishment by somatic stem cells. Aging results in the inability of these tissues
to maintain homeostasis. Evidence accumulated over the past decade has found measurable and successive
age-dependent decline in stem cell activity from adulthood to old age, in various organs, including
hematopoietic, intestinal and muscle. This age-associated decline in stem cell function leads to a decline in the
regenerative capacity in humans and mice, which may limit lifespan. Identifying mechanisms under which aged
stem cells become phenotypically and functionally similar to young stem cells may be a first step towards
designing rationale approaches to ameliorate stem cell aging in the clinics. Based on our preliminary results we
hypothesize that the declining beta-catenin signaling and associated microbiota changes play a causal role in
ISC functional changes upon aging in both mice and humans. To pursue this hypothesis, we will perform three
aims. In aim 1, we will determine the extend of changes in beta-catenin signaling in single ISCs upon aging via
single-cell sequencing approaches and the impact of Wnt expression changes on beta-catenin signaling and a
decline in the function of ISCs upon aging. In aim 2, we will investigate the contribution of various niche cells to
aging-associated changes in beta-catenin signaling in ISCs in vivo. In aim 3, we will determine the role of
microbiota in Wnt ligand expression in the niche cells and in regulating beta-catenin signaling and the function
of ISCs upon aging. The proposed studies will unveil a new mechanism of changes in associating beta-catenin
signaling and microbiota with the physiologic aging process of intestinal stem cells and alterations in tissue
homeostasis. The findings of the proposal may lead to future therapeutic interventions preventing or reversing
tissue aging."

Project summary
 Two-photon laser scanning microscopy is indispensable for imaging the structure and function of the
mammalian brain with subcellular resolution. However, the resolution and efficiency decreases with tissue
depth as a result of scattering and optical aberrations. Adaptive optics can improve multi-photon imaging by
synthesizing a distortion to the wavefront of the excitatory beam that compensates for aberrations in the
wavefront that are created by the tissue. Our system utilized adaptive optics to enable investigators to probe
subcellular dynamics in individual synapses along the full depth of cortex. This is a crucial advance, particularly
as layer 5 and 6 cortical output neurons lie deep to the surface of the brain. Many contemporary studies within
the neuroimaging community are limited by the current inability to record synaptic dynamics within output
regions of cortex, e.g., layer 5, as opposed to within the dominant input layer, i.e., layer 4, and the intermediate
levels, e.g., layers 2/3. We will remove this limit and thus open up a new subfield of in vivo studies on
subcellular determinates of cortical output.
 Our proposed work incorporates ""good engineering practice"" in the design of our current adaptive optics
two-photon microscope design. We will disseminate accurate plans and construction details to enable other
laboratories to duplicate this system. We will further educate the neuroimaging community on the principles of
adaptive optics and the design and utility of adaptive optics-based two-photon microscopes. This effort includes
workshops at UC San Diego. Throughout the period of the proposed grant, we will continue to advance the
adaptive optics two-photon system and update and expand our user base. Proposed new directions include a
rapid shift in focus together with aberration correction for diffraction limited focus over planes separated by as
much as 300 µm and the incorporation of a resonant scanner for fast cell-based imaging. Lastly, we will form a
team effort among users and incorporate feedback from the team to extend adaptive optics into new areas of
inquiry in neuroscience as they arise."
10819183,"The current pandemic highlights a growing imperative to understand how the distal lung epithelium repairs
after injury. While surfactant producing-alveolar type 2 pneumocytes (AT2 cells) also give rise to gas-exchange
promoting alveolar type 1 pneumocytes (AT1 cells), recent studies reinforce the vulnerability of this
morphogenetic step. Mouse injury studies reveal that AT2 cells convert to an AT1 fate through an intermediate
transition-state manifesting activation of integrated stress response (ISR) pathways, a transcriptional state also
found in alveolar epithelial cells from patients with fibrosis or injury secondary to viral pneumonia. We have
discovered that an Inhibitor of the Integrated Stress Response (ISRIB) can facilitate the AT2-to-AT1 transition
step, ultimately attenuating fibrosis in murine models (Watanabe et al., PNAS, 2021). While these data suggest
persistent activation of the ISR in AT2 cells can thwart alveolar epithelial repair, conceptual gaps remain: What
are the upstream morphogenetic events driving this stress response after injury? And how does modulating the
ISR improve the AT2-to-AT1 morphogenetic transition? We have discovered that injury leads to AT2
hypertrophy and polyploidization—notably binucleated AT2s—during the acute injury response. Ex vivo
analysis suggests the route to polyploidy is via failed cytokinesis during the AT2-to-AT1 flattening process.
Attenuating the ISR inhibits the abundance of hypertrophic, polyploid AT2 cells. Based on our published and
preliminary data, we hypothesize lung injury persistently activates the ISR in AT2 cells as they enlarge and
flatten to repair the alveolar epithelium, increasing the susceptibility to mitotic slippage into polyploid AT2 cells.
Accordingly, Aim 1 will determine whether activation of the ISR underpins AT2 polyploidization during the
development of lung fibrosis in mice and humans. Aim 2 will determine whether AT2 polyploidy is necessary or
sufficient to worsen fibrosis in response to subsequent injury. Aim 3 will determine whether AT2
polyploidization results from failed cytokinesis downstream of injury-induced signals that collapse the actin
cytoskeleton. We use treatment with ISRIB throughout to understand molecular processes that guide AT2 cells
through the morpho-genetically stressful AT2-to-AT1 transition required for repair. Overall, we propose AT2
cell divisions are intrinsically vulnerable to injury-induced signals that target F-actin organization, leading to
mitotic failures that promote the polyploid state. A key consequence of AT2 polyploidization is loss of the AT2
stem cell daughter, compromising future regenerative potential."
10819192,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Human papillomavirus (HPV)-driven cancers are common and lethal. There are no biomarker-selected,
molecular targeted therapies for HPV+ cancers. Most of those who progress after initial therapy with radiation
and chemotherapy die within 3 years, demonstrating a significant translational knowledge gap and an unmet
clinical need. Anti-PD1 immune checkpoint therapy (ICT) is effective for recurrent HPV+ cancers, but with
response rates of <20% and a one-year survival rate of <40%. To address the unmet need for biomarker-
driven therapy for HPV+ cancers, we tested the efficacy of 721 unique drugs in 16 HPV+ and 17 matched
HPV-negative cell lines and identified Aurora kinase inhibitors as more effective in HPV+ than HPV negative
cancers. We demonstrated that Aurora kinase inhibition leads to apoptosis in HPV+ cell lines in vitro and
reduced the growth of an HPV+ HNSCC patient-derived xenograft tumor in vivo. HPV+ cancer cells may be
sensitive to Aurora inhibition because of their low Rb expression. RB1 loss and Aurora inhibition are
synthetically lethal in a variety of cancer cell lines and preclinical mouse models. Although the mechanism
underlying this synthetic lethality is unknown, the fact that multiple mitotic genes were identified in screens
suggests that Rb's roles in mitosis and genomic stability are a central part of this mechanism. HPV+ cancers
may rely on mitotic kinases such as Aurora to maintain mitotic fidelity. We hypothesize that Aurora kinase
inhibition results in cell death in HPV+ cancers due to Rb loss-induced genomic instability. Furthermore, we
hypothesize that this cancer cell death will stimulate the cGAS/STING pathway producing type I interferons
and the resulting immunogenic cell death will lead to host T-cell engagement and increased sensitivity to ICT.
This second hypothesis is crucial because cancers nearly always develop resistance to even highly effective
targeted therapies, limiting their long-term benefits. In contrast, ICT results in durable responses in some
patients, making it imperative to seek strategies that enhance the efficacy of ICT. To meet our long-term goal
of improving cure rates for those with HPV+ cancer, we propose mechanistic studies to elucidate the role of Rb
loss-induced genomic instability in Aurora kinase inhibition mediated cancer cell death (Aim 1); in vivo
experiments with the combination of Aurora kinase inhibition and ICT in HPV+ murine model (Aim 2); and to
leverage tissue from a clinical trial to dentify biomarkers predicting response to the combination of immune
checkpoint and Aurora kinase inhibition in patients with recurrent HPV+ cancers. Our proposed research will
have a positive impact because it will address an important problem, the lack of curative therapy for recurrent
HPV+ cancers, and may shift current clinical practice paradigms for these cancers by identifying rational ICT
and targeted drug combinations."
10819194,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Young adults with cancer experience more emotional distress and greater impairments in health-related
quality of life (HRQOL) than older patients. Cancer diagnosis during young adulthood interferes with participation
in normal developmental tasks such as obtaining higher education, starting a career, establishing financial
independence, and developing romantic partnerships. This disruption in normal activities coupled with the
unfamiliar and challenging demands of cancer treatment results in emotional distress and reduced HRQOL.
There is an urgent and critical need to develop, test, and implement evidence-based interventions to support
these young adults as they navigate perhaps the most challenging and debilitating period of their lives.
 Current psychosocial care does not adequately address the unique concerns of young adults. An optimal
solution would give young adults the skills to deal with diverse and numerous stressors, address underdeveloped
problem-solving ability characteristic of this age group, and be relatively simple to learn and use during the highly
stressful time following a diagnosis of cancer. To address these clinical care gaps, this project will evaluate the
efficacy of a problem-solving skills training intervention developed specifically for young adults and grounded in
the core tenets of problem-solving therapy. “Bright IDEAS-Young Adults” (Bright IDEAS-YA) draws upon and
notably extends prior research demonstrating the efficacy of a cognitive-behavioral problem-solving skills training
program for reducing emotional distress in caregivers of pediatric patients. Bright IDEAS-YA is a 6-session, one-
on-one face-to-face intervention that teaches patients a systematic approach to overcome personal challenges
across any life domain. It aims to enhance patients’ problem-solving ability in the face of significant stressors
such as cancer. In preliminary work, young adults with cancer found Bright IDEAS-YA acceptable, relevant, and
useful. Patients who received Bright IDEAS-YA showed improvements in problem-solving ability and reductions
in symptoms of depression and anxiety. In the proposed project, we will conduct a multi-site randomized
controlled trial of Bright IDEAS-YA compared with enhanced usual psychosocial care with 300 YA patients (ages
18-39 years) undergoing cancer treatment. We will evaluate efficacy and examine mediators and moderators of
intervention effects using assessments at baseline, post-intervention (3 months), and follow-up (6 and 12
months). We hypothesize that young adults who receive Bright IDEAS-YA will report improved problem-solving
skills, lower distress (i.e., depression and anxiety), and better HRQOL compared with enhanced usual
psychosocial care. The proposed study aligns with the National Cancer Institute’s Division of Cancer Control and
Population Sciences mission to reduce the burden of cancer and enhance the quality of life of patients and
survivors, particularly among vulnerable groups such as young adults."

Chronic Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) affects 240-300 million people including up to 2 million Americans. Chronic
HBV leads to about 800,000 deaths each year, mainly from liver failure and liver cancer. While HBV spread
can be controlled by vaccines, there is no cure. Chronic HBV can be treated with reverse transcriptase
inhibitors to suppress virus production and improve liver health. But, even after 5+ years of treatment, reverse
transcriptase inhibitors do not lead to a cure. Now, Door Pharmaceuticals, an Indiana-based small business,
proposes to take advantage of the fact that HBV tags viral nucleic acid with its capsid protein (Cp). Based on
this, Door can target these nucleic acids for destruction. Door builds on its extensive experience with Cp, Cp-
binding small molecules, and capsid assembly modulators (CAMs), to invent a new class of antiviral: reactive
CAMs (rCAMs). rCAMs use a Cp-binding moiety to associate nucleic acid-reactive chemistry to viral DNA
and RNA. This association concentrates the reactive component in the vicinity of viral nucleic acid by up to
10^5-fold greater than the bulk concentration. Furthermore, because the reactive group is targeted, it can be
used in very low dosages to minimize off-target effects. Studies with purified Cp have supported our proposed
rCAM mechanism. The long-term goal of this SBIR is to develop and commercialize an rCAM that is curative
for chronic HBV. Door Pharmaceuticals has built a highly qualified team of scientist to develop this promising
technology. In this Phase I SBIR, Door will work with its research partners at Indiana University (Zlotnick and
VanNieuwenhze) to demonstrate the feasibility of Cp-specific targeting to damage HBV RNA and DNA with
the following Specific Aims: Aim 1. Door will develop new rCAMs based on a single Cp-binding scaffold. In
conjunction with other aims, this will support a systematic exploration of the structure-activity relationship
(SAR) to optimize rCAMs. Aim 2. Determine rCAM activity with purified Cp and virus-like particles. This Aim
will mitigate the risk of off-target activity with biochemical assays to test rCAMs for Cp- and capsid-binding
and the ability to damage nucleic acid packaged in HBV capsids. These studies will establish the rCAM
mechanism of action (MOA), a critical topic in an application for Investigational New Drug (IND) status. Aim
3. Determine rCAM efficacy in HBV-expressing cells. Door will test rCAMs in cell culture for the ability to (i)
inhibit production of new virus, (ii) inhibit infection by existing virus, (iii) induce defects in packaged DNA, and
(iv) damage viral covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), the basis of chronic infection. Proposed
experiments will complement chemistry and biochemical results, leading to efficacious candidates for
optimizing pharmacology. At the end of this SBIR Phase I, Door will have determined and documented a
mechanism of action, selected candidate molecules for further pre-clinical testing in Phase II and filed new
patent applications. Phase II will include additional studies leading to the submission of an IND application to
the FDA, and the identification of potential industry partners to support commercialization."
10818404,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and ultimately fatal disease. Within IPF, however, there
exists marked disease heterogeneity as some patients experience a rapidly progressive course while others
experience prolonged periods of stability or stepwise declines triggered by disease exacerbations.
Unfortunately, there are no accepted means by which patients can be clinically “phenotyped” into these
different disease courses at the time of diagnosis. The ability to predict an individual patient’s pace of
progression would greatly impact patient care by enabling better prognostication, individualization of treatment
plans, and early evaluation for lung transplantation for those at highest risk of rapidly progressive disease.
Such knowledge could also be utilized as a cohort enrichment strategy allowing new IPF therapies to be
evaluated in patients at greatest risk of progression thus improving clinical trial feasibility. We hypothesize that
disease activity in IPF is driven by ongoing lung injury and that measurements of ongoing lung injury could be
utilized to predict prognosis and treatment response. Vascular leak, a cardinal response to tissue injury, has
been implicated in the development of IPF. Alveolar-capillary permeability is increased in the lungs of IPF
patients, and the extent of this increase has been shown to correlate with disease progression and mortality.
We will use the advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique of dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)
MRI to assess vascular permeability in the lungs of IPF patients and healthy volunteers and prospectively
evaluate if these MRI-derived measures of lung vascular permeability predict subsequent IPF disease
progression. We will also evaluate whether increased plasma levels of soluble Ephrin-B2 (sEphrin-B2), a novel
molecular biomarker of lung injury in fibrosis, can identify IPF patients most likely to experience disease
progression. Lastly, we will perform lung DCE-MRI prior to and after initiation of anti-fibrotic therapy with
nintedanib, which we hypothesize will decrease lung vascular permeability by inhibiting vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF), to assess whether our MRI-derived lung vascular permeability measures are decreased
with treatment. This research will be performed by Dr. Sydney Montesi, a pulmonary and critical care physician
at Massachusetts General Hospital, an Instructor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, and a specialist in
the care of patients with pulmonary fibrosis. She will receive first-rate training in advanced lung imaging and
biomarker development. She will be exceptionally mentored by Dr. Peter Caravan, a pioneer in molecular
imaging of fibrosis, and co-mentored by Dr. David Christiani, an expert in biomarker development for lung
injury. She will perform her research in a world-renowned academic center with all required resources available
to her. Dr. Montesi’s goal is to become a physician-scientist in patient-oriented research of pulmonary fibrosis.

Young adults have the highest prevalence of waterpipe tobacco smoking (WTS) of any age group in the U.S.
Extensive evidence shows that they consistently misperceive WTS as less harmful and less addictive than
cigarette smoking, and these misperceptions are positively associated with WTS. Despite these widely held
misperceptions, WTS is associated with serious acute and chronic harms, even among infrequent users. In
addition, WTS is prospectively associated with cigarette smoking initiation putting young adults at greater risk
for cancer. Considerable evidence shows that cigarette warnings effectively convey health information to
consumers, resulting in increased motivation to quit and quit attempts. Waterpipe warnings have the potential
to convey accurate information about health harms to consumers, but the currently-mandated text warning,
focused solely on nicotine addiction, is likely to have limited impact. The goal of this project is to develop
warnings to promote greater understanding of harms and to reduce WTS behavior among young adults. We
will use a systematic, evidence-driven, rigorous approach to develop waterpipe warnings and test these newly-
developed warnings in two contexts: (1) on waterpipe tobacco packaging; and (2) in an ecologically-valid
waterpipe café setting. In Aim 1, we will develop text and pictorial waterpipe tobacco warnings to effectively
communicate a broad range of health harms. We will first develop 30 text warnings based on the most
robust science; then vet warnings with experts in WTS epidemiology, toxicity, and regulation. We will next
conduct a national survey to determine the five most effective text warnings, which will then each be paired
with three different images creating 15 pictorial warnings. We will conduct a second national survey to
determine the most promising image for each of the five text warning statements, resulting in five text and five
corresponding pictorial warnings to be carried forward to Aim 2. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the effect of text or
pictorial warnings on waterpipe tobacco packaging on WTS intentions using a nationally representative sample
of 1,500 young adults and will determine the two text and two corresponding pictorial warnings with the highest
perceived effectiveness for use in Aim 3. In Aim 3, we will determine the impact of text and pictorial warnings
displayed at waterpipe cafés on WTS behavior. We will conduct a three-arm (text, pictorial, no warning control)
cluster randomized crossover trial in 18 waterpipe cafés to determine the effect of warning type on young
adults' WTS behavior using an objective, biological marker of waterpipe tobacco consumption (expired carbon
monoxide). This study will contribute to a growing body of research on how best to design health warnings to
discourage WTS, and will identify important behavioral antecedents, which may include negative affect,
cognitive elaboration, perceived risks, and knowledge. The proposed research has the potential to make a
significant contribution towards cancer prevention by reducing WTS through the development and testing of
warnings that could influence local, state, and federal policies."
10818508,"The vertebrate enteric nervous system (ENS), the largest portion of the peripheral nervous system,
mostly derives from the vagal neural crest which arises in the caudal hindbrain, migrates to the foregut
and along the entire length of the gut, differentiating into many different neuronal subtypes. In humans,
defects in ENS formation cause Hirschsprung’s Disease, or colonic agangliogenesis. While ENS neurons play
critical roles in regulating gastrointestinal motility, surprisingly little is known about how or what controls neuronal
lineage specification in the ENS. The recent advent of single-cell technologies promises to help elucidate
identification of neuronal cell types and molecular mechanisms underlying enteric neuronal differentiation.
 Zebrafish offer several advantages for tackling important questions in ENS development due to their
simplified enteric nervous system, accessibility to genetic manipulation and facility of imaging. Similar to
amniotes, the zebrafish gut contains neural crest-derived neuronal subtypes, ranging from serotonergic,
cholinergic and dopaminergic neurons to VIP, Substance P and Nitric Oxide (NO)-containing neurons. Here, we
propose to perform single cell RNA-seq of individual enteric precursors and neurons at different developmental
stages (2-6 dpf) within the developing ENS. The function of candidate transcription and signaling factors in ENS
neuronal specification will be tested by CRISPR-Cas9 perturbation experiments in both zebrafish and chick.
Finally, single cell ATAC-seq will be used to identify and then dissect enteric enhancers to build an ENS gene
regulatory network. We propose to perform the following aims:
Aim 1: Transcriptional profiling of the enteric neural crest-derived cells at individual cell resolution using
single cell RNA-seq and multiplex fluorescent in situ hybridization. We will perform single cell RNA-seq on
thousands of cells per time point (2-6 days post-fertilization) of enteric precursors and neurons dissected and
sorted from the zebrafish embryonic gut. We will validate expression of genes of interest, in particular
transcription factors and signaling molecules, using hybridization chain reaction (HCR) and infer developmental
trajectories from progenitor to neuronal differentiation.
Aim 2: Role of transcription factors in differentiation of ENS neuronal subtypes in zebrafish and chick.
We will mine the scRNA-seq to identify transcription factors whose expression correlates with the progenitor
state (e.g. hey1a) and various neuronal subtype markers (e.g. ebf1a, etv1, Klf6a, Insm1a) for functional validation
using CRISPR-Cas9 mediated knock-out in zebrafish and in chick.
Aim 3: Identifying active enhancers associated with neuronal differentiation in the ENS using single cell
ATAC-seq. We will use single cell ATAC-seq to identify and test putative regulatory elements functioning in
neuronal precursor and differentiating neurons in the developing zebrafish ENS. Putative enhancing regions will
be tested for their ability to drive ENS expression in zebrafish, mutated and tested for conservation with amniotes."
10818511,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 A decline in mitochondrial quality and activity has been associated with normal aging and correlated with
the development of a wide range of age-related diseases. Therefore, rejuvenating mitochondrial function or
improving mitochondrial quality control might be an effective strategy to combat aging. Mitophagy is an essential
mitochondrial quality control mechanism that mediates the lysosomal clearance of damaged mitochondria.
Increasing lines of evidence have established the longevity-extending effects of enhanced mitophagy in various
model organisms. Interestingly, recent studies suggest that augmented mitophagy may counteract aging-
associated cardiac dysfunction. Therefore, identifying more efficient and specific agents that can modulate the
clearance of defective mitochondria via mitophagy are likely to have significant therapeutic benefits. We
conducted high-content image-based assays for mitophagy modulators using the pH-dependent fluorescent
mitophagy reporter, mt-Keima. We identified the selective neddylation inhibitor, MLN4924, to be the most
effective mitophagy activator. Neddylation is a posttranslational modification that attaches ubiquitin-like protein
NEDD8 to protein targets via NEDD8-specific E1-E2-E3 enzymes. Of note, our mechanistic studies suggest
MLN4924 effectively blocks neddylation of Cullin 2, a component of the elongins B/C-Cullin 2-Rbx1 (Ring-Box
1)-VHL (Von Hippel-Lindau protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (CRL2VHL). The inhibition leads to an
accumulation of the Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1 Subunit Alpha (HIF1α), a CRL2VHL substrate, and subsequent
activation of the BCL2-interacting protein 3 (BNIP3), a mitochondrial receptor for mitophagy induction. These
results provide a novel connection between neddylation and mitophagy. This project aims to delineate the novel
mechanistic link between mitophagy and neddylation, and to determine whether mitophagy represents a novel
mechanism and therapeutic target for treating age-related cardiac dysfunction. These studies will be facilitated
by our recently described mt-Keima mouse model to monitor in vivo cardiac mitophagy. Additionally, we will
utilize a set of innovative reagents to genetically and pharmacologically modulate neddylation. To directly assess
the role of neddylation in the heart, we have generated mice with the cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of NAE1,
encoding a subunit of the E1 neddylation activating enzyme. In Aim 1 of the proposed studies, our goal is to
determine the mechanisms by which inhibiting neddylation regulates mitophagy in cardiomyocytes and the heart.
In Aim 2 of the proposed studies, we will genetically and pharmacologically manipulate neddylation in the adult
heart using mouse models that lack NAE1 or are treated with MLN4924. We will determine whether restoring
mitophagy via inhibiting neddylation ameliorates age-related cardiac dysfunction. Completing the proposed
studies will produce critical insights into the role of mitophagy in age-related pathological conditions, and will
fundamentally advance our understanding of the mechanisms of mitochondrial quality control in the heart."

Developmental programming of neural circuits modulating metabolic state is critical to maintain homeostasis.
Despite an increasing prevalence of metabolic disorders, our understanding of the developmental integration of
neural circuitry linking homeostatic drinking and feeding states remains rudimentary. Agouti-related peptide
(AgRP) neurons are ideally positioned, both anatomically and functionally, to mediate direct communication
within metabolic circuits. Importantly, AgRP neurons respond to developmental cues to project to the
paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH) and the median preoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus
(MePO) during the second week of life. The PVH integrates a variety of neuroendocrine signals, and the MePO
modulates fluid intake with neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS)-expressing neurons activated in response to
thirst to drive drinking. Recent evidence suggests the MePO and PVH are linked by distinct neural connections.
However, the anatomical organization and functional integration between the MePO and PVH has not been
determined, nor has the organization and integration of their neural projections during development been
defined. Evidence in rats suggests circuits controlling drinking function early in life, prior to AgRP projections
reaching hypothalamic targets, suggesting milk intake is controlled by activation of thirst rather than hunger
during the early developmental period. Further, disruptions to developmental cues by over- or undernutrition
appears to decrease AgRP inputs to the PVH. Moreover, prolonged dehydration in adults results in decreased
feeding and body weight until blood osmolality has been restored, implicating close integration of feeding and
drinking. Because the PVH receives inputs from AgRP and nNOS-expressing neurons, it may represent a core
neural node that functions to integrate drinking and feeding states. However, a detailed understanding of the
mechanisms of developmental integration of feeding and drinking is lacking. Because early perturbations specify
the organization of feeding circuitry during critical periods of development, and feeding and drinking have
integrated responses in adults, it is possible that exposure to hypertonic saline during these periods may cause
permanent changes in the architecture of AgRP-regulated circuits in the PVH, and consequently, metabolic
physiology. The overall hypothesis of this application is that activation of neural circuits regulating drinking during
a critical period of development impacts the architecture of feeding circuits with lasting consequences for energy
balance regulation. As a first step toward testing this hypothesis, the following specific aims will be pursued: 1)
Define the developmental time course of neural circuits controlling thirst in neonatal mice; 2) Define how early
exposure to repeated dehydration impacts the development of AgRP inputs to the PVH, and 3) Determine the
subsequent effects on the dehydration-induced anorexia response and neuronal signaling in the PVH in adults.
Completion of these aims will establish a novel framework for understanding how the brain integrates drinking
and feeding with new insight into the developmental events that impact metabolic phenotypes throughout life."

procedures, efforts to identify strategies that can effectively prevent reintubation are of critical importance.
Career Development: Dr. Freundlich's career development plan integrates formal coursework with
personalized training with his mentors and collaborators to 1) strengthen his methodologic foundation in the
conduct of pragmatic comparative effectiveness trials; 2) develop expertise in the implementation of EHR-
embedded clinical trial design; 3) advanced statistical modeling techniques to improve risk prediction; and 4)
bolster his skills as a leader of a multi-disciplinary research team.
Environment: VUMC is an established leader in biostatistics, perioperative informatics, and pragmatic clinical
trial design and conduct. It is the ideal environment to foster Dr. Freundlich's development into a national
leader in his field. Dr. Freundlich has identified experts at VUMC, each of whom is a leader in his or her field
and will help mentor Dr. Freundlich towards his goal of research independence. Vanderbilt's Clinical and
Translational Science Award (CTSA) funded “Learning Healthcare System”, intended to facilitate research that
uses novel methods to integrate clinical research into clinical care, will help Dr. Freundlich as he works on the
proposed research and career development plans."
10819222,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic inflammatory disorder affecting approximately 1.5 million people in the
United States. Although parenchymal lung disease, which encompasses interstitial lung disease (ILD) and
emphysema, is a common lung complication of RA with increasing prevalence and mortality, no strategies
currently exist for early detection or risk stratification of progressive disease. This is an area of unmet need that
could lead to improved opportunities for intervention and a decrease in the considerable morbidity and
mortality of RA-associated parenchymal lung disease.
 In this proposal, we aim to fully characterize early parenchymal lung disease in RA and establish risk
factors for progressive disease. We hypothesize that clinical and molecular risk factors can predict the
development and progression of RA-associated parenchymal lung disease, including preclinical ILD (preILD)
and emphysema, and that the molecular profile of progressive RA-preILD will overlap with fibrotic RA-ILD. To
test this hypothesis, we will propose the following: In Specific Aim 1, we will determine the prevalence and
progression of RA-associated preILD and emphysema using visual and objective radiologic approaches and
correlate these measurements with functional capacity, respiratory symptoms, and health-related quality of life
assessments. In Specific Aim 2, we will define clinical and molecular determinants that predict the
development and progression of RA emphysema and compare the molecular profile of emphysema with
preILD to provide mechanistic insight into the divergent patterns of parenchymal lung injury caused by RA. In
Specific Aim 3, we will demonstrate that progressive RA-preILD and fibrotic RA-ILD have similar molecular
signatures, suggesting phenotypic and mechanistic overlap. To achieve the aims of this proposal, a
longitudinal cohort of 200 RA patients without a history of ILD will be followed for up to 6 years with detailed
clinical, functional, radiologic, and molecular phenotyping.
 The successful completion of this research will provide us with a better understanding of the early
characteristics and natural history of RA-associated ILD and emphysema and establish novel non-invasive
ways to identify those at risk for progressive disease. This will enable closer monitoring and earlier
opportunities for intervention, potentially leading to decreased morbidity and mortality in individuals afflicted
with RA-associated parenchymal lung disease."
10815699,"Deployment and combat exposure substantially increase the risk for insomnia and other sleep disorders
in military personnel. These findings match with the 6-fold increase in the diagnosis of sleep disorders in the
VA in recent years. The most prevalent sleep disorder, insomnia, is associated with an increased risk for
suicide. Furthermore, disrupted sleep and abnormal cortical activity are common in severe neuropsychiatric
conditions affecting veterans such as dementia and schizophrenia. Thus, a better mechanistic understanding
of the brain circuitry controlling sleep-wake cycles and cortical oscillations are urgently needed to develop
novel treatments for veterans and other vulnerable populations. Accordingly, the broad objective of this
research program in mice is to identify new therapeutic targets to correct abnormalities of sleep and cortical
electrical activity. We will use an innovative approach in mice which characterizes subgroups of neurons based
on their developmental origin and identifies the transcription factors which control their activity in adults,
allowing targeted therapies which recalibrate their activity to restore normal sleep and cortical rhythms. We
focus on the basal forebrain, a region involved in sleep-wake activity, attention and reward which degenerates
in dementia, and on the largest group of neurons in this region which release the inhibitory neurotransmitter,
gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA). We target neurons which express three transcription factors linked to
insomnia and other neuropsychiatric disorders common in veterans by genetic and postmortem studies.
 The roadmap to helping veterans is: We will identify new groups of neurons based on their
developmental origin (Aim 1). We will use transgenic mice which allow manipulation of their activity to
determine how they affect sleep-wake behavior and cortical oscillations (Aim 2). Finally, we will state-of-the-art
genetic techniques to identify the transcription factors which control their activity in adults (Aim 3), allowing us
to correct abnormal sleep-wake behavior and cortical electrical activity in neuropsychiatric disorders by
designing viral vector based therapies which act on those transcription factors (long-term goal).
 Forebrain GABAergic neurons are generated in the subpallium, an area of the developing brain
implicated in the risk for developing diverse neuropsychiatric disorders affecting veterans. Within the
subpallium, different groups of GABAergic neurons are generated by progenitors in the caudal, medial and
lateral ganglionic eminences and embryonic preoptic regions. In each region, different transcription factors
specify unique groups of neurons. We will use genetically modified mice which express an enzyme, Cre
recombinase (Cre), under the control of these transcription factors to identify them and manipulate their
activity. Crossing these mouse strains with another mouse strain which expresses a red fluorescent protein in
the presence of Cre, in combination with immunostaining will allow us to map their location and phenotype
(Aim 1). In Aim 2 we will study their function by increasing their activity or ablating them using injections of viral
vectors which express proteins in the presence of Cre. These experiments will reveal the role of these neurons
in sleep-wake behavior and control of cortical electrical activity for the first time and set the stage for
translational studies to alter their activity. Finally, in Aim 3, we will begin the first step towards a translational
approach by using state-of-the art genetic techniques to modulate the activity of one of these transcription
factors, Lhx6, whose expression is altered in a GABAergic cell-type implicated in schizophrenia. We will use a
state-of-the-art gene editing technique called Clustered Regularly Interspersed Short Palindromic Repeats
(CRISPR), which is currently being tested in clinical trials for various disorders.
 If successful, as suggested by our strong preliminary data, this project will allow novel translational
approaches to study and correct disease-related abnormalities in veterans by manipulating the activity of basal
forebrain neurons and genes which regulate sleep-wake behavior and cortical electrical activity."
10801241,"Graft versus host disease (GVHD) is the major complication associated with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation (HSCT). During the acute phase of this disease, a restricted set of organs is affected of which the
gastrointestinal (GI) tract is the most clinically significant. Proinflammatory cytokines play a critical role in the
pathophysiology of intestinal GVHD, in part, by activating donor innate and T cell populations which
subsequently induce tissue damage. We previously demonstrated that CD4+ T cell production of granulocyte-
macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) plays a critical inflammatory role in the pathophysiology of GI
GVHD. More recently, we have identified two CD4+ GM-CSF+ T cell populations within the GVHD colon
microenvironment that possess distinct transcriptional profiles, employ non-overlapping gene regulatory units,
emerge with divergent temporal kinetics, have differential responsiveness to IL-7, and are distinguishable by the
presence or absence of IFN-γ co-expression, suggesting that they may have different pathogenic roles in
mediating GVHD in the GI tract. In addition, our preliminary studies have uncovered a previously unappreciated
interleukin 34 (IL-34)-mediated regulatory pathway that inhibits the emergence of CD4+ GM-CSF+ T cells in
the GI tract, indicating the existence of a potential therapeutically targetable cytokine to reduce GM-CSF-
mediated inflammation in this tissue site. The overall goal of this proposal is therefore to delineate mechanistic
pathways by which CD4+ GM-CSF+ T cells promote pathological damage in the GI tract and define how these
populations are regulated by IL-34. Our overall hypothesis is that there exist discrete CD4+ GM-
CSF+ T cell populations that have distinct functional roles in mediating pathological damage
in the GI tract and that are regulated by the host production of IL-34. Studies in Specific Aim 1 will
define the pathogenicity of CD4+ GM-CSF+ T cell populations during GVHD. To address this question, we will
employ a recently created GM-CSF fate reporter mouse model that faithfully identifies viable GM-CSF-
expressing CD4+ T cells in GVHD target organs. Experiments in Specific Aim 2 will identify key transcription
factors and define the role of IL-7 in the development of CD4+ GM-CSF+ T cells. We will employ genetically
modified murine models that will ascertain the extent to which specific transcription factors are required for the
development and pathogenicity of CD4+ GM-CSF+ T cells and determine the dependency of these cells on IL-7
receptor signaling. Studies in Specific Aim 3 will characterize how IL-34 regulates GM-CSF-responsive innate
immune cell populations in the GI tract during GVHD and affects the emergence of CD4+ GM-CSF+ T cells.
Experiments will identify mechanistic pathways by which IL-34 regulates GVHD and determine whether these
pathways can be therapeutically targeted to reduce disease severity. The overall objective of this proposal is to
develop new insights into the pathophysiology and regulation of GVHD within the GI tract that will foster the
development of clinically relevant strategies to mitigate this complication in allogeneic HSCT recipients."
10801647,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Skin sensory neurons are essential for detecting noxious environmental threats and inducing pain and itch.
Neurotransmitters released from skin nerve endings not only mediate these forms of neural sensation but also
drive or regulate inflammatory responses. Several members of the Mas-related G-protein coupled receptor
(MRGPR) family are expressed in sensory neurons and thought to play a crucial role in neuroimmune
interactions. It remains unclear, however, which MRGPRs serve to transduce itch- and inflammation-inducing
signals in atopic dermatitis and other allergic skin diseases. Evidence from our published and preliminary studies
points to mouse MrgprA1 and its human counterpart, MRGPRX2, as the physiologically relevant receptor for
substance P (SP), a neuropeptide with a well-established role in itch and neurogenic inflammation. This finding
challenged the widely held notion that SP stimulated dorsal root ganglion neurons via the neurokinin-1 receptor
and prompted us to investigate whether MrgprA1/MRGPRX2 serves as a key mediator of neuroimmune
interactions and contributes to atopic dermatitis (AD) where itch and inflammation manifest as major
pathophysiologic features. The proposed research will test the hypothesis that MrgprA1/MRGPRX2 expressed
on sensory nerves serves as the SP receptor and plays a crucial role in itch and allergic skin inflammation. For
this investigation, a newly developed mouse model of skin inflammation will be used that closely recapitulates
AD pathophysiology and visualizes peripheral nerve fiber dynamism with exquisite clarity. We will pursue the
following specific aims during the project period: to elucidate the role of MrgprA1 in neuronal SP sensing and
inflammation-associated itch (Aim 1); to determine the contribution of Mrgpr-expressing sensory neurons and
MrgprA1 signaling to shaping the skin immune microenvironment and driving allergic skin inflammation (Aim 2);
and to assess the potential of antagonizing MrgprA1 action and MrgprA1+ nerve dynamism for AD treatment
(Aim 3). The proposed research tests novel ideas and seeks to close knowledge gaps in neuroscience,
immunology, and skin biology. If successful, this research project will establish new molecular mechanisms by
which neuronal Mrgpr signaling mediates neuroimmune interactions and contributes to AD and other allergic
skin diseases. This knowledge will translate into effective clinical strategies for the treatment of itch and skin
inflammation."

The global objective of this research is to elucidate the mechanisms underlying tissue homeostasis and
regeneration in mammalian skin and to understand how this process goes awry in human disorders, including
cancers. Central to achieving this goal is the characterization of the different stem cells (SCs) within skin,
determining their relative contributions to tissue homeostasis and wound-repair, and elucidating how changes in
their niche microenvironments impact these events. Past AR050452 research led to purification of hair follicle
(HF) bulge and basal inter-follicular epidermal (Epd) cells and established them as long-lived, self-renewing SCs
that function in tissue regeneration and wound-repair. However, both in their biology and their tissue regenerative
tasks, these SCs display distinct behaviors predicated by their unique microenvironments (niches). The field still
lacks a comprehensive knowledge of the constituents of these niches, the nature of SC:niche interactions, and
how they help SCs cope with stressful situations. Past AR050452 research set the foundations to tackle the next
key questions: (1). What are dynamics in bulge niche components that drive HFSC behavior during the hair
cycle? (2) What are the key niche:HFSC interactions that maintain quiescence and drive tissue (hair)
regeneration and how do they differ from the niche: short-lived progeny interactions that drive hair differentiation?
(3) How are HFSCs spared during the destructive phase of the cycle when hair growth ceases and most follicle
cells below the bulge apoptose? Does eating confer increased SC fitness? (4) How do HFSC:niche interactions
change when skin is injured and the SCs become repurposed to repair the wound? How do SCs protect
themselves against immune/pathogen attack so that they can orchestrate the re-epithelialization process? (5)
How does the natural process of wound-repair differ from the behavior of a SC when it acquires an oncogenic
mutation that will ultimately lead it down a path to cancer? To answer these questions, we'll use FACS, single
cell spatial transcriptomics and chromatin landscaping, conditional gene knockout and RNAi screens in vivo and
employ these methods to explore skin stem cells in their native, wound-induced and tumorigenic environments."
10793475,"Abstract
COVID-19 severity/lethality is associated with a dysfunctional inflammatory immune response and a hyper-
engagement of pathways driving hemostasis and thrombosis, but the link between the two manifestations is not
understood. Compared to patients with mild symptoms, severe COVID-19 patients have stronger IgG reactivity
to SARS-CoV-2 virus and its spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) and a robust B-cell response with a
marked increase of the CD11c+CD21- B cells and plasmablast compartments. The incidence of thrombosis and
inflammatory disease in severe COVID-19 is unprecedented, manifested by increased plasma inflammatory
markers, such as IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha, C-reactive protein, and activation of compliment pathway
etc., and dysregulated activation of cellular components participating in inflammatory and coagulation responses
that include platelets, endothelial, monocytes, and neutrophils. The thrombotic manifestation ranges from
arterial, venous, and tissue micro thrombosis to thromboembolism and is predominated by venous
thromboembolism. Similar manifestations are observed in catastrophic thrombosis associated with heparin-
induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HIT). Patients with catastrophic HIT have the sudden onset of
multiple arterial and venous thrombi with, but sometime without, heparin exposure, due to prothrombotic platelet-
activating IgGs that recognize platelet factor 4 complexed with heparin polysaccharide (PF4/H). Using methods
employed in previous studies of HIT, we studied patients with severe COVID-19 patients and identified PF4/H-
reactive, pro-thrombotic IgG antibodies that closely resemble pathogenic antibodies found in patients with HIT
in their ability to activate platelets. Surprisingly, levels of PF4/H antibodies in the patient plasma correlated with
levels of antibodies specific for the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We cloned
RBD-specific antibodies that are able to activate platelets. Compared to those that recognize RBD alone,
significantly more B cells recognizing both RBD and PF4/H were CD11c+, CD21- and CXCR3+, which mark a
subset of extrafollicular B cells robustly expanded in severe COVID-19. Based on these findings, we hypothesize
that SARS-CoV-2 infection drives a subset of RBD-specific B cells to respond via an extrafollicular
pathway and generate platelet-activating antibodies that contribute to thrombotic complications but not
virus neutralization in severe COVID-19. To test our hypothesis, we will 1) investigate the prothrombotic
activity of RBD-specific antibodies in the plasma of hospitalized COVID-19 patients; 2) investigate the expansion
of B cells that make RBD-specific platelet-activating antibodies in severe COVID-19; 3) investigate the
developmental pathway that governs affinity maturation of RBD and PF4/H cross-reactive B cells. Our proposal
studies a novel B-cell/platelet axis in thrombotic complications in COVID-19 and should unravel a large portion
of the complex pathogenesis of morbidity/mortality in this disease and suggest new treatment."

This proposal seeks support for a translational grant funded continuously by NICHD for the past 26 years. Altered
partitioning of fat, independent of obesity, during adolescence carries a high risk for insulin resistance (IR), T2D
and Fatty Liver. Over the last decade, we formed “The Yale Study of Body Fat Patterning in Obese Adolescents”
cohort, assessed the role of body fat distribution as a modifier of glucose/insulin metabolism and described a
distinct “metabolic phenotype” typified by a thin superficial layer of abdominal SAT, increased VAT, fatty liver
and marked IR . Recently, longitudinal follow-up of this cohort revealed that the High VAT/(VAT+SAT) phenotype
is the best predictor of fatty liver in youth. To unravel the cellular mechanisms underlying the inefficient fat
storage in abdominal SAT we began, in the current cycle, with Marc Hellerstein to employ the 2H2O labeling
method to measure in vivo the dynamic fluxes of triglycerides, De Novo Lipogenesis (DNL) and adipocyte
turnover in the abdominal and gluteal SAT . Highlights: Obese adolescent girls with High VAT/(VAT+SAT)
display: a- Increased in vivo rates of lipolysis in abdominal and gluteal SAT; b- higher adipocyte turnover; c- the
increased lipolytic rates related strongly to Fatty Liver. Building on these findings, the overarching goal of this
proposal is: To unravel the underlying molecular mechanisms by which impaired insulin-mediated
suppression of lipolysis from two SAT depots occurs and its link with Fatty Liver, in obese adolescents
with the unfavorable pattern of abdominal fat distribution. The Specific Aims & Hypotheses (H) are:
Aim 1 & H1 - To determine the underlying molecular mechanisms causing the increased in vivo lipolysis
flux in the abdominal and gluteal SAT depots of obese with High VAT/(VAT+SAT) compared to BMI, age,
and gender matched obese youths with Low VAT/(VAT+SAT). H1: Increased WAT lipolysis in obese youth
with High VAT/(VAT+SAT) will be associated with decreased insulin-stimulated insulin receptor kinase (IRK)
phosphorylation leading to increased ATGL, CGI-58, PLIN1 and HSL phosphorylation. Aim 2 & H2a- To test
whether increased rates in gluconeogenesis (GNG) associated with the excessive WAT lipolysis in the
SAT contribute to hepatic IR in obese youths with High VAT/(VAT+SAT) compared to BMI, age, sex
matched obese youths with the Low VAT/(VAT+SAT). H2b- Increased rates of WAT lipolysis in obese youth
with High VAT/(VAT+SAT) will correlate with increased rates of hepatic GNG, which in turn can be attributed to
increased hepatic acetyl-CoA content as reflected by increased rates of β-OHB turnover. Aim 3 & H3: To
determine the mechanisms mediating the temporal development of fatty liver we will test the hypothesis
that changes in De Novo lipogenesis (DNL) over time will be associated with changes in fatty liver in
obese youths.

Overall Approach: In lean and obese youth recruited for this study we will use a combination of
cellular/molecular techniques (G.I Shulman), clamp+isotopes, MRI and in vivo measures of lipid
fluxes (S. Caprio & N. Santoro) and adipocyte turnover (2H2O labeling method) (M. Hellerstein) in SAT depots."

Obesity has reached epidemic proportions in the USA, with more than 40% of the population classified as obese
(body mass index (BMI) > 30 kg/m2), and nearly 10% as severely obese (BMI > 40 kg/m2). Cardiovascular
disease (CVD), especially heart failure, is highly associated with obesity. Reliable non-invasive cardiovascular
imaging tests are needed to provide accurate diagnosis and prognosis in this patient group. Unfortunately, obese
patients present a diagnostic challenge to current non-invasive cardiovascular imaging modalities. Computed
tomography and single-photon emission computed tomography can require excessive radiation for successful
imaging of obese patients, while echocardiography suffers from limited windows and signal attenuation leading
to degraded image quality. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of obese patients at conventional field strengths
(1.5T and 3.0T) is primarily limited by narrow patient bore and table weight limits. As lower field strength allows
greater flexibility in magnet design, a new low-field (0.55T) MRI with a unique, ultra-wide 80 cm bore and 700 lb.
table weight limit that can accommodate severely obese patients was recently announced by Siemens. One of
the first such systems in the USA will be installed at our institution this summer. In this project, we will develop
cardiovascular MRI techniques for this system, and demonstrate their clinical value in severely obese patients.
Our group and others have recently shown initial feasibility of cardiovascular imaging at low field. We believe
that this new low-field MRI platform, when combined with the advanced pulse sequences and image
reconstruction methods developed by our team, can unlock the potential of this novel system as a more reliable
means to provide non-invasive cardiovascular imaging to patients with severe obesity. Furthermore, the reduced
field strength will make MRI safer and more effective in the growing number of patients with implanted devices.
We will prove low-field MRI utility for CVD assessment. Aim 1 will establish the feasibility of low-field
cardiovascular MRI regardless of body habitus. We will develop image acquisition and reconstruction techniques
specifically designed to compensate for the reduced MR signal at 0.55T compared to higher field. This will offer
a comprehensive assessment of cardiovascular structure and function, and myocardial tissue. Aim 2 will validate
these techniques in normal weight to severely obese healthy individuals and CVD patients, by head-to-head
comparison with standard 70 cm bore 1.5T MRI in those able to safely fit in both machines. Aim 3 will apply the
validated techniques to evaluate the efficacy of a low-field cardiovascular MRI exam in heart failure patients who
are severely obese (BMI > 40 kg/m2) and cannot be safely imaged on standard MRI systems. We will compare
the comprehensive diagnostic value of 0.55T MRI against echocardiography, and will correlate MRI markers to
clinical symptoms of heart failure severity determined by a six minute walk test in these patients.
The cardiovascular techniques that we develop for this imminent novel 0.55 T MRI system provides a timely
solution for effective clinical care and management of the increasing population of severely obese CVD patients."
10931487,"Despite federal prohibition on the sale or prescribing of cannabis and cannabinoids (CAC), their medical use
has been legalized in 37 states. Although there is limited evidence of its effectiveness, 18-42% of persons with
cancer report using CAC to help manage symptoms,
most of whom obtain advice from local CAC dispensaries
rather than their oncology providers. Almost 50% of oncologists recommend CAC for their patients, but <30%
feel sufficiently informed to make specific recommendations. Thus, there is an urgent need for more research
to guide both patients and providers on the optimal use of CAC in oncology care. There is strong evidence on
the benefits of CAC for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting and for mitigating general
chronic pain. There is weaker evidence on the effectiveness of CAC to help manage other symptoms that
many persons with cancer report using it for, including appetite loss, depression, anxiety, and insomnia. No
studies have been done on whether CAC use by cancer patients changes their use of standard palliative
therapies, such as opioids to manage pain, and the mechanism by which this occurs. Well-known negative
effects of CAC use have not been well studied, and may include an increased risk of infections, injuries,
reduced memory and concentration, cannabis use disorder, and increased use of tobacco and alcohol. In
response to these knowledge gaps, we propose a longitudinal observational study in a community-based
health care setting comparing CAC users to non-users on the safety and effectiveness of CAC. We will enroll
persons with incident colorectal or non-small cell lung cancer, or with non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, who are
initiating systemic primary or adjuvant cancer therapy. We anticipate that 25% of the study cohort will report
using CAC based on prior surveys and our preliminary data. We will survey persons soon after therapy is
started, and conduct follow-up surveys 2, 4, 6, and 12 months later. We will use validated survey instruments
to collect CAC use, and use PROMISÒ measures to capture patient reported outcomes (PROs). To obtain
more granular details on CAC use for symptom control, we will also conduct brief (5 minute), weekly, daily
assessments in a subset (n=500) of subjects, including all CAC users. We will conduct our study within the
Kaiser Permanente Southern California health plan to capitalize on the availability of a high volume of eligible
cases and comprehensive electronic health records containing essential clinical data. Our specific aims are to:
1. Assess the effects of CAC use on PROs, focusing on pain, nausea, anxiety, depression, insomnia, appetite
loss, and overall HRQOL (defined by physical, emotional, social functioning) among persons undergoing active
systemic cancer therapy; 2. Assess whether and how CAC use affects the use of standard palliative therapies,
such as reducing the use of opioids; and 3. Assess the negative effects from CAC use. The rapid increase in
CAC use by cancer patients has occurred despite the lack of evidence about its effectiveness and safety. Our
study will inform the best clinical strategies and policies for limiting potential harms and enhancing benefits."
10790891,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in adolescence are common and robustly associated with adult CVD
events. Clinical capacity for intensive behavioral intervention is insufficient to meet demand, and moreover,
standard behavioral interventions have had limited efficacy in adolescents. Pediatric guidelines identify critical
gaps: we need more effective adolescent interventions, with a greater focus on CVD risk factors beyond BMI,
and we need to build lean, effective and scalable treatment packages using the multiphase optimization strategy
(MOST). In response, we propose to develop and pilot-test a novel Cardiovascular Health (CVH) Promotion
Program (CPP) precisely tailored for adolescents with CVD risk factors. Our preparatory work systematically
identified intervention components expected to be effective based on theory, evidence, and user preferences.
We propose to overcome efficacy limitations of standard interventions by adding novel components to engage
emotion and identity mechanisms of adolescent behavior. These core motivational mechanisms are highly sali-
ent in adolescence, which is marked by self-identity formation, heightened emotionality, and emotion regulation
difficulties. Concurrently, we propose to overcome scalability issues through protocolized, remote, and largely
self-guided delivery methods, based on our successful adult interventions. We will employ the MOST framework
to systematically optimize CPP for efficacy while balancing the need for scalability. The current R34 will be the
Preparation phase of MOST, yielding refined intervention components and operational guidelines for the Opti-
mization-phase RCT. In Aim 1, we will adapt and iteratively refine existing intervention content, including the
Diabetes Prevention Program for standard behavioral content, the Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treat-
ment of Emotional Disorders in Adolescents for emotion regulation content, and academic interventions for iden-
tity content. We will tailor content for the target population and adapt it for remote delivery via self-guided videos
and worksheets, brief 1:1 coaching, and group sessions. Our person-centered iterative design process will en-
gage adolescents to refine intervention prototypes and protocols via think-aloud/interview sessions, with further
input from our Teen and Adult Community Advisory Boards. In Aim 2, we will randomize 42 adolescents with
CVD risk factors to 1 of 3 arms in an 8-week pre-post pilot trial. Arms will vary 4 components added to standard
behavioral content: emotion content (yes/no), identity content (yes/no), group sessions (yes/no), and coaching
dose (high/low). The 3 arms will test conditions with the highest burden (all yes/high), lowest novelty (all no/low),
and greatest contamination risk (mixed). Mixed quantitative/qualitative data will establish feasibility, acceptability,
and fidelity against predefined benchmarks. This R34 will fully prepare us to conduct the Optimization-phase

testing. This work directly responds to NHLBI’s calls (NOT-HL-21-020) and is expected to ultimately produce a
scalable, accessible intervention that empowers diverse adolescents to enter adulthood with favorable CVH."
10793483,"Abnormal neuronal activity in the brain leads to epileptic seizures that, when repeated or prolonged, can cause
neuronal damage resulting in delayed psychomotor development and intellectual disability. Most genetic
variants associated with epilepsy are in genes encoding ion channels, including potassium channels that
regulate neuronal excitability such as IKM channels. Inherited mutations in the IKM channel cause a wide
spectrum of early-onset epileptic disorders. The long-term goal of this research program is to understand the
mechanisms by which the wt IKM channel work, how epilepsy-causing mutations lead to dysfunction of IKM
channels and to design drugs that correct IKM dysfunction. The objective of this application is to determine how
epilepsy-inducing mutations in the IKM subunits KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 cause channel malfunction. Because
polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have been shown to alleviate the symptoms of intractable epileptic
seizures, we will investigate the mechanisms by which these compounds reverse channel malfunction and
therefore improve neuronal function. The overarching hypothesis is that that epilepsy-causing mutations in
KCNQ channels affect voltage sensor movement and that PUFAs can restore normal voltage dependence of
voltage sensor movement in mutated KCNQ channels. The rationale for the proposed research is that
understanding the molecular basis by which different mutations in the IKM channel are linked to epilepsy will not
only help explain epilepsy pathogenesis but also provide clues for intervention strategies. Guided by
preliminary data, we will test our hypothesis by pursuing three specific aims: (1) determine the mechanisms by
which epilepsy-causing mutations affect IKM channels function. (2) determine how PUFAs affect voltage sensor
and gate movements of IKM channels bearing epilepsy-associated mutations and to identify which PUFA
variants restores channel function, and (3) determine whether PUFAs reduce hyperexcitability on neurons
bearing epilepsy-causing mutations in IKM channels. Under the first Aim, we will combine cysteine accessibility
and VCF approaches to simultaneously measure voltage sensor movement and gate opening in the wt IKM and
a set of epilepsy-associated mutants. This will allow us to determine how mutations affect the movement of the
voltage sensor and the activation gate in KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 channels. We will also incorporate unnatural
amino acids (UUAs) into mutated channels (UUAs mutagenesis) to further map the molecular determinants of
channel dysfunction. Under Aim 2, we will test PUFA variants with different chain lengths, different acyl chains
and different types of polar head groups to determine the molecular mechanism of PUFA’s effects on these
mutations. Under the third Aim, we will test PUFA variants that can correct channel function and restore activity
in iPSC-derived cortical neurons bearing epilepsy-associated mutations in KCNQ2 and/or KCNQ3. The
proposed research is significant because the anticipated results will provide the mechanistic basis for how
mutations cause IKM channel defects and will show proof-of-concept that PUFAs can act as antiepileptic drugs."
10793486,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is an aggressive malignancy that remains largely incurable. The dismal
prognosis of PDA reflects its advanced disease stage at diagnosis and its profound resistance to existing
therapies. The KRAS oncogene is mutated in 95% of PDAs and acts as a potent driver of PDA growth and
maintenance. Oncogenic KRAS induces transcriptional upregulation of NFE2L2, which encodes the NRF2
transcription factor, a master regulator of redox homeostasis that protects cells from the cytotoxic/cytostatic
effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Importantly, we found that genetic ablation of NRF2 suppresses the
growth of pancreatic cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo (2). Although elevated levels of ROS are generally
believed to induce cytotoxicity through irreversible damage to macromolecules, particularly DNA and lipids, we
discovered that genetic ablation of NRF2 did not lead to DNA or lipid damage (2). Instead, both protein synthesis
and tumor cell fitness were compromised as a consequence of reversible and selective oxidation of cysteine
residues on key regulators of protein synthesis (2). Based on these observations, we hypothesize that NRF2
promotes pancreatic tumorigenesis through its ability to regulate oxidative post-translational
modifications (oxPTM). Herein, we propose to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this process, determine
the functions of redox control in PDA, and identify potential therapeutic targets. To this end, we will use ChIP-
seq and RNAseq to identify direct Nrf2 targeting genes that govern cysteine oxidative modification (Aim 1). In
addition, we will use a variety of biochemical approaches to delineate the mechanisms through which cysteine
oxidation contributes to protein synthesis in PDA. We will further define transcript-specific effects of redox-
dependent translation regulation through ribosome profiling (Aim 2). In addition to cysteine, we recently
discovered that perturbation of NRF2 activity also leads to the reversible oxidation of the other sulfur-containing
amino acid, methionine. Various biochemical and genetic approaches will be taken to assess the functional role
of methionine oxidation in pancreatic tumorigenesis (Aim 3). We anticipate that our results will explain
fundamental aspects of redox homeostasis in PDA and will inform the development of more effective therapies
for pancreatic cancer and potentially other KRAS-driven malignancies."

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) exerts a disproportionate burden of morbidity and mortality on African
Americans in the rural southeast. Much of this excess has been attributed, directly and indirectly, to social
determinants of health and resulting health-related social needs. While CVD prevention interventions have
reduced overall disease burden, they have failed to eliminate racial and geographic disparities in CVD. New
models of care, such as Accountable Health Communities, address health-related social needs through
screening, referral, and community navigation services and have begun to demonstrate improvement in health
care cost, use, and CVD risk factors. Rural minority communities, where the burden of CVD risk factors and
social needs are high, healthcare facilities may be more fragile and density of resources may be lower, have
even greater need for effective and scalable solutions to addressing health and social needs. Our proposal is
anchored by Bandura's Self-Efficacy theory, Grey's Self and Family Management Framework, and Andersen's
Behavioral Model of Health Services Use. We will use the Consolidated Framework for Implementation
Research to study implementation and effectiveness of integrating health-promoting community resource data
into the EMR via CommunityRx (CRx). The CRx-CVD intervention is a digital solution that links patients with
community-based resources to address health-related social needs and cardiometabolic health in rural AA
patients. Our overall objective is to identify factors that influence implementation and assess the health
impact of a closed-loop referral system to community health-promoting resources in a rural setting. We use a
hybrid II implementation effectiveness design to conduct a controlled pragmatic trial of patients (adults 18
years and over, children 2-17 years; N=750) in a system of federally qualified health centers in rural North
Carolina. We hypothesize that integration of closed-loop referrals will increase patient knowledge of community
resources, enhance self-efficacy to manage CVD risk factors, increase utilization of community resources and
improve markers of cardiometabolic conditions. To our knowledge, this trial will be the first to evaluate the
implementation and health impact of a low intensity, scalable, clinic-initiated intervention targeting AA adults
and children at risk of CVD. Furthermore, we will conduct cost-effectiveness analysis related to implementation
of CRx-CVD to inform scaling the intervention. The long-term goal is to identify scalable interventions to
reduce CVD risk and health-related social needs of African Americans using a “whole person” approach to
health."
10793579,"Abstract
Functional genomics studies have unraveled many of the instructions encoded in the human genome. Taking
advantage of significant advances in parallel sequencing and a wide diversity of other protocols, studies are
proposed in this application to resolve gene-environment interactions that determine variations in the
susceptibility to lung cancer. These studies are timely in light of the worsening levels of environmental pollution
in many US cities that contribute to the development of respiratory disease and to disparities across populations.
Of concern is the persistence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) contaminants, such as benzo(a)pyrene
(BaP), and their ability to damage the DNA of lung epithelial cells. While the mutagenicity of BaP has been
extensively characterized, questions remain about the degree to which DNA damage intersects with epigenetic
disruption in driving the overwhelming carcinogenic response of BaP. Genome-wide assessments of BaP toxicity
in the Ramos Laboratory revealed that the parent hydrocarbon and its metabolites activate LINE-1
retrotransposons in lung epithelial cells via epigenetic mechanisms. LINE-1 (Long Interspersed Element-1)
activation is associated with oncogenic signaling, changes in chromatin structure, disruption of epigenetic
control, and malignant transformation. LINE-1 is a family of mobile elements with the ability to copy their own
DNA and use these complementary sequences to randomly insert at other locations within the genome. This
process can be highly mutagenic and associated with genomic instability. We posit that alterations in the lifecycle
of LINE-1 retroelements is a key missing link in our understanding of the complex genetic and epigenetic deficits
associated with BaP carcinogenicity. Of ~100 full-length LINE-1 elements that remain competent for
retrotransposition, nine are recognized as “hot” LINE-1s responsible for the vast majority of pathogenic events.
These hot elements are polymorphic in humans and may therefore contribute to heterogeneity in genetic
susceptibility to environmental PAH toxicity. In response to RFA-ES-20-018, we propose to use in vitro functional
genomics for discovery and validation to test the hypothesis that polymorphic LINE-1 elements differentially
regulate oncogenic signaling in lung epithelial cells and account for differences in susceptibility to BaP. In Aim
1, we will examine hot LINE-1 elements and their constitutive and inducible expression in normal lung and
cancerous epithelial cells by targeted DNA sequencing and single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). In Aim 2,
we will use CRISPR/dCas9m to edit the LINE-1 promoter to either enhance or silence retrotransposition and its
impact on chromatin structure and transcriptomic landscapes. In Aim 3, we will use computational approaches
to study genetic relationships across variable networks defined by polymorphic LINE-1 variants, with a focus on
TP53, AHR, and RB. These studies will reveal important mechanistic insights into the activation of LINE-1 by
PAH carcinogens and illuminate our understanding of the human variability in carcinogen susceptibility. This
knowledge will lead to better biomarker designs and novel therapies to combat environmental toxicities."
10793582,"PROJECT ABSTRACT With the career goal of becoming an independent health services researcher, Dr.
Susan Calcaterra describes a mentored research project and a rigorous career development plan which will
prepare her to become a leader in the integration of opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment in the hospital setting
with linkage to OUD care post discharge. Nearly 200 people died every day from an overdose in 2017 in the
United States (US). In 2012, there were 527,000 hospitalizations due to opioid use which cost more than $15
billion in medical care. For patients with OUD, there are proven benefits to initiating buprenorphine in the
hospital with treatment referrals and prescribing naloxone at discharge. Unfortunately, OUDs are often not
addressed in the hospital resulting in a missed opportunity to provide patients evidence-based treatment.
There are 50,000 hospital-based physicians (hospitalists) caring for hospitalized patients in the US. This vast
workforce offers a potential solution to initiate buprenorphine in the hospital, provide naloxone at discharge,
and ensure patients are referred to ongoing OUD treatment. There is a critical need to determine why
buprenorphine and naloxone are not routinely prescribed to hospitalized patients with OUD and to sustainably
integrate evidence-based OUD treatment in the hospital using the existing workforce. Without this knowledge,
many hospitalized patients will fail to receive lifesaving medication. The proposed research centers on the
hypothesis that hospitalist’s knowledge and beliefs impact OUD treatment and the hospital’s current structures
and processes do not support OUD treatment. Study Aims include: 1) a qualitative investigation into key
barriers to the integration of evidence-based OUD care into hospital practice in three academic hospitals with
hospitalists, psychiatrists, pharmacists, social workers and nurses; 2) the development of a multicomponent
intervention that adapts evidence-based OUD treatment to the hospital setting by addressing reported barriers
in Aim 1 and by systematically meeting the needs of hospitalists, nurses, pharmacists and social workers
within their workflow; and 3) pilot test a multicomponent intervention to improve OUD treatment in one hospital
over 12 months. Use the RE-AIM framework to measure changes in buprenorphine and naloxone prescribing
(Reach) and changes in the number of providers licensed to prescribe buprenorphine (Adoption) pre/post
intervention implementation. Interview hospital providers to identify ongoing Implementation barriers and to
learn about adaptations made to the intervention to improve its efficiency and ease of use. To accomplish
these aims, Dr. Calcaterra will pursue training in 1) qualitative research methods to inform the intervention
development, 2) intervention development to modify healthcare provider behaviors, and 3) dissemination and
implementation science for future intervention dissemination. Upon completion of these activities, along with
intensive mentorship, Dr. Calcaterra will be positioned to conduct a larger comparative effectiveness trial to
further implement, test and refine the intervention’s fidelity (future R01)."
10791552,"Amyloid diseases afflict 10 million patients worldwide. This project is focused on AA amyloidosis, a life-threatening complication of chronic inflammation wherein deposition of serum amyloid A (SAA), and its fragments causes kidney and liver damage and, if untreated, death. There is no cure for AA and the treatment options are very limited. To help design amyloid-specific therapies, we will determine how lipids and GAGs, the major ligands of SAA, influence its misfolding. Our prior research revealed that SAA clears diverse lipids from the sites of injury by sequestering them into nanoparticles that facilitate sPLA2 lipolysis; we established the structural basis for this SAA action. Our goal now is to determine how this lipid-scavenging function is linked to pathologic amyloid deposition. Our hypothesis rooted in extensive pilot studies is that lipoprotein formation by SAA is antagonistic to amyloid formation while GAG binding is agonistic. Our powerful approach integrates an array of biochemical, biophysical and computational methods to test this and other new ideas in 3 complementary Specific Aims. Aim 1 will determine how biochemical composition of SAA-lipid complexes influences amyloid formation. Murine or human recombinant SAA will be reconstituted with diverse lipids in complexes that will be selectively hydrolyzed, and amyloid formation will be explored by spectroscopic, electron microscopic, immunochemical and other tools. The results will help identify key steps in SAA-lipid homeostasis that critically influence amyloid formation, and will test a fascinating idea: lipid-modifying strategies may help treat AA amyloidosis. Aim 2 will dissect the amyloidogenic pathways of lipid-bound and free SAA and how GAGs affect these pathways. We will explore the interplay between SAA binding to lipids and GAGs, lipolysis, and formation of amyloid oligomers and fibrils. The results will help target SAA-GAG interactions in AA and other amyloid diseases. Aim 3 will utilize our new versatile ELISA-based assay that uses micrograms of protein to quantify the binding to amyloid modulators during fibrillogenesis. SAA binding to various GAG mimetics and small-molecule drugs will be used as a model; key results will be validated by other methods. Our pilot studies explain the failure of prior clinical trials for AA and suggest that larger molecules can block the SAA-GAG binding. Moreover, we will use our new assay to determine how other amyloid proteins (A, -synuclein, tau, TTR, etc.) interact with diverse amyloid modulators (GAGs, apoE, etc.) Impact: this project will advance AA research and therapeutic targeting to a new level. Moreover, it will develop new tools and concepts that can be extrapolated to other systemic and neurodegenerative amyloid diseases, such as Alzheimer’s and other major diseases."
10791616,"A wide variety of environmental stressors, from pesticides to common anticancer chemotherapies, result in
protein damage. This damage underlies diseases such as cancer and neurodegeneration, and when caused by
prescription drugs, leads to toxic side effects limiting usage. To cope with these proteotoxic stresses, cells
express molecular chaperones, co-chaperones, and a variety of additional support proteins – collectively referred
to as the proteostasis network (PN) – that are integral for the proper synthesis, folding, stability and degradation
of the cellular proteome. Thus, understanding the regulation and function of the PN is critically important in
understanding its role in the interface between disease susceptibility and exposure to environmental stressors.
We previously developed a broadly applicable framework and online resource (FIREWORKS) to interrogate
biological networks using unbiased genetic screens. Using our FIREWORKS framework, we mapped the
constituents of and relationships between stress response pathways in human cells coping with growth-related
molecular stresses revealing a network of 146 genes with vital functions spanning diverse stress contexts. Here,
we propose to expand this resource to create an unbiased and global map of the response to environmental
proteotoxic stress. We will integrate our cutting-edge chemical-genetic screening platform with our FIREWORKS
computational pipeline to identify components, function, and regulatory nodes critical for the cellular response to
environmental stressors. In parallel, we will identify transcriptional changes that occur immediately and
throughout longer periods of environmental stress exposure, to provide a framework for understanding cellular
adaptation to these stressors. Collectively, this map will serve as a major resource for the research community,
provide a more complete understanding of cellular environmental stress response programs, and lead to insights
into the large variability in the risk of adverse events that arise from exposure to these insults."
10793537,"Veterans with fractures suffer from injury-associated pain as well as post-operative surgical pain. The
occurrence of a fracture contributes to acute pain and is largely manifested by mechanical, inflammatory, and
neuropathic components. The LEAP study of high-energy lower extremity trauma showed that acute pain, in
the recovery period after severe trauma, is the single largest predictor of long-term chronic pain 5-10 years
after injury. There are 2 main strategies to treat trauma-induced and post-surgical pain: opioids and
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Neither drug class completely alleviates pain, and both have
negative side effects. Opioids, beyond eliciting cognitive impairment, are commonly associated with tolerance
and addiction. NSAIDs are commonly used in combination with opioids following thoracic/abdominal surgery
but use of this drug class for fracture pain is discouraged in the U.S. due to negative effects on skeletal health
and healing of the injured skeleton. It is unclear which drug class is less destructive to the bone repair process
but prevention of nonunion is paramount in the treatment of fractures as it places additional burden on the
patient and the healthcare system due to prolonged pain and disability. Therefore, identification of therapies
which improve both the bone healing process and diminish the fracture-associated pain is warranted. Our
recent data demonstrate that mRNA levels of Sirtuin-1 (Sirt1, an NAD+ class III histone deacetylase) are
robustly elevated during fracture healing. Fracture healing is impaired with age, bone loss, inflammation, and
with neurodegeneration. Importantly, Sirt1 improves all of these conditions; however, to our knowledge, with
the exception of our studies, nobody has specifically examined the effects of Sirt1 on fracture repair. Here we
show that pharmacological activation of Sirt1 by SRT1720 allows for improved fracture healing while reducing
pain behaviors. Based on these observations we hypothesize that activation of Sirt1 in mesenchymal
lineage cells and associated nervous system interactions will enhance bone healing and reduce pain in
mice by regulating inflammation. The proposed work will test this hypothesis, and may provide evidence that
pharmacologic activation of Sirt1 could serve both as a novel bone healing agent and post-fracture analgesic
agent. In Aim 1, we will demonstrate that SRT1720 can improve bone healing and reduce pain behaviors and
inflammation in mice, and determine which cells require Sirt1 activation by SRT1720 for successful bone
healing, reduced pain behaviors, and reduced inflammation. In Aim 2, we will determine how SRT1720
treatment, mesenchymal lineage cells, and primary afferent sensory neurons (PANs) regulate inflammation,
and we will examine the crosstalk between mesenchymal lineage cells and PANs. Successful accomplishment
of these Aims will demonstrate the utility of using Sirt1 activators as novel bone healing and post-fracture
analgesic agents. The latter, could replace the necessity of opioids for pain management, serve as an
important step in fighting the opioid crisis, and could significantly improve patient outcomes."
10793542,"ABSTRACT
Protein kinases orchestrate signal transduction pathways that are essential for most normal cellular functions.
Importantly, dysregulation of protein kinase signaling is both a cause and consequence of several human
diseases, especially cancer. Due to their druggability, more than seventy small-molecule therapeutics that
block the ATP-binding site of kinases have been approved, mostly for oncological diseases. Since the ATP-
binding site is relatively conserved, most targeted therapeutics can simultaneously inhibit on- as well as off-
target kinases, impacting efficacy as well as toxicity. Remarkably, chemical proteomic profiling has now
revealed that along with off-target kinases, protein kinase inhibitors can also bind and inhibit non-kinase
proteins. Particularly, the mitochondria-localized heme biosynthesis enzyme, ferrochelatase (FECH) has
emerged as a common target which can be inhibited by more than 10% of kinase inhibitors. How FECH
inhibition influences drug responses, especially toxicities, nevertheless remains unknown. Given their
widespread clinical use, there is a clear unmet need to understand the mechanistic basis of kinase inhibitor
toxicities, especially related to inhibition of non-kinase proteins. In this regard, our recent study has provided
the first evidence that off-target FECH inhibition by BRAF-kinase inhibitor vemurafenib contributes to renal
tubular epithelial cell (RTEC) death in vitro and nephrotoxicity in vivo. However, there is a knowledge gap in
our understanding of how kinase inhibitors are transported into normal cells, how the subsequent FECH
inhibition drives mitochondrial dysfunction, and how these pathways are differentially regulated in males versus
females. To address these questions, we have performed genome-wide RNAi and CRISPR based screens,
which have provided two key insights: (i) we have identified putative mechanisms responsible for vemurafenib
uptake, FECH inhibition, mitochondrial dysfunction, and RTEC cell death. (ii) We have uncovered a unique
gender-specific difference in toxicity, wherein vemurafenib treatment induces a female specific FECH
upregulation in RTECs imparting resistance to nephrotoxicity. In the current application we propose to utilize a
suite of in vitro and in vivo chemical genetic and gene knockout approaches to further illuminate the regulatory
mechanisms that govern toxicities associated with vemurafenib-induced FECH inhibition. Using this approach,
in Aim 1 we will employ RTEC-specific conditional knockout mice, primary cells, and CRISPR-based knockout
cell lines to examine the role of cubilin-dependent endocytosis in vemurafenib uptake, FECH inhibition, and
mitochondrial dysfunction. In Aim 2 we will utilize conditional knockout mice and primary cells to examine the
role of RUNX1 in female specific FECH upregulation and resistance to vemurafenib nephrotoxicity. These
studies are expected to provide broad insights into the pharmacological action of kinase inhibitors in normal
tissues including cellular uptake, non-kinase target inhibition, mitochondrial dysfunction, and transcriptional
mechanisms underlying gender differences in toxicities."
