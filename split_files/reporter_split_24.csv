Almost one million newborns die each year from failure to breathe at birth. Nearly all of these deaths occur in
low and lower-middle income countries (LMICs). These deaths result when life-saving bag mask ventilation
(BMV) is delayed or interrupted. Simulation-based training is commonly used to improve BMV, but gaps in
performance remain. There is strong scientific premise for improving BMV with feedback strategies. In
randomized simulation trials, feedback during BMV (real-time guidance) and after BMV (debriefing) improves
performance. Feedback during bedside resuscitations may reduce delayed and interrupted BMV, but requires
expert clinician-educators. Mobile health (mHealth) technology could enable implementation and evaluation of
feedback strategies at the bedside in LMICs. The overall goal of this study is to reduce newborn mortality by
improving BMV in LMICs through bedside feedback using an innovative mHealth application called
LIVEBORN. The specific aims of this study are to 1) develop LIVEBORN, an mHealth application to improve
BMV, 2) design and evaluate feasibility of feedback strategies for LIVEBORN, and 3) evaluate effectiveness of
LIVEBORN in a hybrid, randomized trial. This proposal will take place in 10 health facilities in Kinshasa,
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) with midwives. LIVEBORN will identify depressed newborns using
heart rate from a new heart rate monitor and data on provider action’s entered by an observer. After comparing
actions to recommended care, LIVEBORN will deliver real-time guidance and support debriefing. LIVEBORN
will be developed through a scientifically rigorous process involving formative research, technical development
and usability testing. Integrated mHealth strategies for feedback with LIVEBORN (one for real-time guidance
and one for debriefing) will be designed in collaboration with Congolese midwives from two facilities using trials
of improved practices. The final strategies will be evaluated in a 3-month feasibility test in preparation for a
hybrid, randomized trial. In a hybrid, randomized trial, eight facilities will be cluster randomized to real-time
guidance or debriefing with LIVEBORN. After a period of baseline data collection, midwives will implement their
assigned feedback strategy with LIVEBORN. The effectiveness of feedback with LIVEBORN on BMV will be
evaluated comparing baseline and intervention data. If feedback with LIVEBORN is effective, the relative
effectiveness of real-time guidance versus debriefing will be evaluated. The primary outcome will be the time to
initiation of BMV. Secondary outcomes will be interrupted BMV and 24-hour newborn mortality. Feasibility and
acceptability of feedback with LIVEBORN will be evaluated using a mixed methods approach. This study will
be executed by a strong collaboration of five institutions: the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC),
the Kinshasa School of Public Health (KSPH) in the DRC, Laerdal Global Health, RTI International and
Jhpiego. KSPH’s capacity to conduct mHealth research will be strengthened through the development of an
mHealth Implementation Science course and establishment of a KSPH-UNC Implementation Science Core."

Improving alcohol use disorder (AUD) treatment access and outcomes among Veterans is an urgent public
health priority. The lifetime prevalence of AUD among Veterans is twice that of civilians. Veterans also incur
more severe and persistent AUD symptoms with more lengthy and complex treatment courses and negative
outcomes compared to the general population. Despite the critical role that family members play in the etiology,
course, and treatment of AUD, and the robust evidence base supporting the efficacy of several existing family
AUD treatments, family treatment protocols are lengthy and burdensome for patients and clinicians. Thus, there
is a critical need to develop efficacious family AUD treatments that are both brief and highly accessible to
Veterans. Members of our team developed and refined the Brief Family Involved Treatment (B-FIT) protocol in
an NIAAA-sponsored pilot trial among civilians. B-FIT is a 3-session cognitive behavioral therapy designed to be
implemented in combination with any existing alcohol treatment program. The goals of B-FIT are to 1) increase
reinforcement of treatment-facilitating behaviors, 2) increase the perceived reinforcement value of abstinence by
increasing anticipated positive rewards from abstinence, and 3) reduce drinking cues by decreasing negative
communication and increasing positive communication with family members. This study resulted in findings that
support feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of B-FIT. In a separate study, our team has
demonstrated excellent feasibility and acceptability of delivering dyadic AUD treatment via home-based
telehealth. Thus, the primary objective of this Stage II trial is to examine the efficacy of B-FIT in combination with
treatment as usual (TAU; VA Substance Treatment and Recovery [STAR]) versus TAU alone in 1) reducing
alcohol consumption, 2) improving family functioning, and 3) improving STAR treatment satisfaction, adherence,
and retention among Veterans. To accomplish this, we will employ an open randomized controlled design and
examine standardized, repeated, dependent measures of change at multiple time points. We will also leverage
our team’s standard operating procedures for fully remote study implementation, close collaboration with regional
VA STAR clinics, and a robust national VA telehealth infrastructure which is prepared to efficiently translate
positive findings into treatment. The proposed study is directly aligned with NIAAA’s mission and Strategic Plan
in that it will 1) employ electronic health technology to improve the effectiveness and accessibility of AUD
treatment for Veterans, 2) will advance AUD treatment access among rural and underserved Veterans, who are
a health disparity population, 3) focuses on Veterans in a real-world treatment setting (i.e., VA STAR clinics), 4)
examines B-FIT for home-based telehealth delivery, and 4) will identify characteristics of Veterans and family
members most likely to benefit from the addition of B-FIT to their recovery program. Our findings will directly
inform clinical practice and accelerate treatment in this important but understudied area."

Arsenic is a widespread toxin in drinking water that affects millions of people, increasing the risks of
neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases and cancers. High doses of arsenic cause DNA damage and
genome instability. However, the health effects associated with low-dose arsenic are controversial. Recently,
we discovered that large networks of DNA damageome proteins (DDPs) promote DNA damage and genome
instability (Xia et al. Cell 2019). We also found that Aquaporin 3 (AQP3) is a new lung cancer-associated DDP.
This application describes the mechanism by which AQP3 interacts with low-dose arsenic to promote DNA
damage, an approach to map AQP3, arsenic-induced double-strand break (DSB) hotspots, and associated
mutation signatures in human cells and populations. Specifically, it will (1) provide mechanistic insights into
how AQP3 potentiates arsenic-induced DNA Damage, (2) map DSBs caused by AQP3 and low-dose arsenic
interactions, and (3) identify AQP3 and arsenic-induced genome instability and mutational signatures. The
proposed studies will bring function to endogenous DNA damage and the DNA damageome proteins when
interacting with environmental toxicants. Mechanistic insights into how low-dose arsenic interacts with risk
genes are critical knowledge for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of arsenic-associated diseases. This
project will identify early biomarkers to predict the long-term health impacts of arsenic, and uncover mutational
signatures to infer cancer etiology and reveal past arsenic exposure. Lastly, the platform developed in this
proposal will be useful for uncovering the effects of environmental toxicants and/or carcinogens with host
genes. In addition to its scientific proposal, this application also lays out a comprehensive training plan that will
help the candidate achieve his career goal of becoming an independent investigator who will apply his unique
background in endogenous DNA damage to better understand genes-exogenous environmental agents (e.g.
arsenic) interactions. Further interdisciplinary knowledge in environmental health, formal bioinformatics, and
quantitative genomics training, as well as CRISPR and organoid training will put him in a unique position to
tackle challenging environmental health research problems. Dr. Chris Amos, Director of the Institute for Clinical
and Translational Research at the Baylor College of Medicine will lead a group of co-mentors and advisory
committee members to provide advice on research and career development with advancement to a tenure
track position."

Cancer vaccines have significantly advanced cancer immunotherapy; and recent successes of mRNA
vaccines have raised prospect of generating potent anti-tumor response by specifically delivering mRNAs
encoding tumor-associated antigens to antigen presenting cells (APCs). However, APC activation elicited by
nanoparticles containing antigen mRNAs is rather limited. Circulating monocytes offer a promising cell target as
an abundant APC precursor that can be deposited to spleen, lymph nodes, and tumor tissue following
polarization and activation. The overall objective of this study is to engineer
kinetically assembled poly(beta-
amino ester) (PBAE)
/mRNA nanoparticles (KaNPs) that can specifically deliver mRNAs encoding tumor antigens
and immunoadjuvants into circulating monocytes in vivo and demonstrate the safety and efficacy of this new
mRNA cancer vaccine platform. This study is built on the preliminary results showing biodegradable
PBAE/mRNA KaNPs with an optimized size of 400 nm mediated preferential transfection of circulating
monocytes following intravenous (i.v.) injection, leading to more effective transfection and deposition of
circulating monocytes and a higher level of tumor-killing activity compared to the standard small size
PBAE/mRNA nanoparticles. In this proposed study, we plan to pursue four specific aims: (1) optimize the
composition, size, and surface functionality of PBAE/mRNA KaNPs to improve targeted mRNA delivery efficiency
into circulating monocytes in vivo, (2) characterize pharmacokinetic profile of PBAE/mRNA KaNPs and define
functions of transfected circulating monocytes in vivo, (3) assess the immunotherapeutic efficacy of PBAE/mRNA
KaNPs in suppressing tumor growth in combination with TLR9 and STING agonists in mouse tumor models, and
(4) develop an GMP-compliant, shelf-stable, lyophilized PBAE/mRNA KaNP formulation and validate the efficacy
in a mouse model. If successful, this study will uncover structure-function relationships in a previously
inaccessible size range (200–1000 nm) for gene therapy carriers, demonstrate circulating monocytes as a potent
mRNA therapeutic target and the role of KaNP-transfected circulating monocytes in potentiating antitumor
immune responses, and inspire rational design of new mRNA-based immunotherapies for treatment of solid
tumors and metastatic cancers."

The Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are chronic
inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract with no cure. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have
found >250 genomic loci associated with IBD, but variant contributions to mechanisms driving IBD pathogenesis
and disease prognosis remain unclear. Each locus typically contains tens to hundreds of variants, the vast
majority of which are in non-coding regions suggesting a role in gene regulation. For most loci, the causal variant,
the affected regulatory element, and the target gene being regulated are unknown. We hypothesize that
regulatory variants contribute to IBD phenotypes by altering gene transcriptional programs driving phenotypic
heterogeneity. We propose to identify putative casual regulatory variants using two, orthogonal, high-throughput
analyses. Aim 1: Regulatory quantitative trait loci (QTL) for chromatin accessibility (caQTL) and transcription
factor binding (tfQTL) associate genetic variation with alterations in regulatory activity. For variants in GWAS
loci, these analyses will identify regulatory variants with potential contributions to regulation in disease-relevant
cell types and tissues. Aim 2: Alternatively, massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA) systematically interrogate
allelic effects on transcriptional regulation of thousands of genetic variants. MPRA using vectors of human DNA
regulatory elements containing IBD associated variants of interest can be performed in mouse cells or organs
due to the well-established conservation of transcription factor motifs between human and mouse. We will use
MPRA to determine variants that alter regulatory activity in colon, ileum, and mesenteric lymph nodes under both
normal and LPS-stimulated inflammatory states. Aim 3: Integrating results from QTL and MPRA assays, we will
select high confidence putative IBD regulatory variants for intestinal epithelial cell focused functional validation
in patient derived 2D intestinal monolayer systems. The long-term goals of this project are: 1) To fill the gap
between our ability to detect genetic, gene regulatory, and gene expression variation linked to IBD and our ability
to explain how that variation ultimately contributes to IBD; and 2) To provide a unique data resource for IBD
investigators to access for their own studies."

Exosomes, also referred to as small extracellular vesicles, play important roles in cellular communication under
physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Exosomes contain a wide range of both short and long non-
coding RNAs that regulate many aspects of gene expression including epigenetic processes that modulate
cellular fate, phenotype, polarization, and morphogenesis. Despite the important functional roles played by
exosomal RNAs, there are currently no methods that allow live exosomal RNA tracking. This is because RNA is
by nature non-fluorescent and difficult to label while maintaining its intended biological function. Access to
exosomal RNA is further complicated by the fact that each RNA species is present at extremely low copy
numbers in exosomes. This emphasizes both the need for a novel marker capable of tracking the intercellular
movement of exosomal RNA, and the need to enhance loading of RNAs into exosomes.
Given the central importance of exosomal RNAs in dictating cellular behavior, there is a need and demand for
exosomal RNA imaging methods to determine how (a) cells use exosomes and their cargoes to communicate
with each other and (b) how exosomes modulate their microenvironment and travel to distant organs and tissues.
Existing methods focus on tracking exosomes by labeling the lipid membrane via a lipid-based fluorophore or
exosomal protein labeling. None of these methods allow the tracking of exosomal RNA via genetic encoding or
barcoding without exogenously modifying the exosomes after extensive collection and alteration steps.
The overall goal of this proposal is to develop genetically encodable RNA EXO-Code probes that allow
multimodal tracking and imaging of exosomal RNAs. The EXO-Code probe will allow multimodal tracking of
exosomal RNA via (1) genetic encoding, (2) non-destructive labeling with fluorescent dyes, and (3) unique
identification and quantification based on barcoding. This combination is powerful as it allows tracking of
exosomal RNA via multiple modes for high content biodistribution mapping. Because EXO-Code barcodes are
composed of unique nucleotide sequences, they can be accurately decoded using sequencing with sensitivity in
the attomolar range. The combination with a fluorogenic RNA aptamer allows for complementary tracking of
exosomal RNA via simple incubation with dyes. The fluorescent exosome toolkit will be developed for
investigators to detect disruptions in membrane stability, exosomal fusion events, and endocytic processes as a
result of exosome biogenesis, distribution, and uptake. This will enable researchers to track exosomal RNAs
through organisms, cells, and their ultimate destinations within subcellular compartments."

Chronic insults, such as inflammation and replicative stress, impair and exhaust blood-sustaining
hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), leading to dysfunction and selection for leukemia-associated mutations. We
propose to study HSC insults in sickle cell disease (SCD), a chronic hemolytic anemia with a large
inflammatory component and increased hematopoietic demand. Hematopoietic abnormalities in SCD include
increased circulating hematopoietic stem and progenitors (HSPCs), increased numbers of BM HSPCs with
perturbed phenotypes and damage to the bone marrow (BM) niche. Older SCD patients also mobilize HSPCs
poorly and can become refractory to hydroxyurea. Mounting evidence indicates that SCD patients may have
enhanced rates of clonal hematopoiesis, as well as MDS and AML at baseline and following allogeneic HSC
transplantation or autologous HSC gene therapy. Considering that these are the only curative therapies for
SCD, it is important to better understand and prevent SCD-induced insults to HSCs and their micro-
environment. Thus, here we will examine the fitness of the HSC pool in individuals with SCD. Pilot
data reveals a dramatic loss of both phenotypic and functional HSCs in middle-aged mouse models of SCD.
HSCs in these mice also display evidence of increased cell cycling. Paradoxically, RNA-sequencing reveals
senescence-related changes in SCD HSCs. Indeed, substantially more SCD HSPCs were positive for biomarkers
of senescence in both mice and individuals with SCD, relative to age-matched controls. Based on our
preliminary findings, we hypothesize that premature senescence driven by pathologic stress
contributes to HSC dysfunction during SCD. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will interrogate HSCs isolated
from mice with SCD for molecular and functional hallmarks of senescence using high-resolution microscopy,
single cell transcriptomics and quantitative assays for HSC function. We will also test if treating SCD mice with
drugs that eliminate senescent cells can restore function to the HSC pool. In Aim 2, we will interrogate BM
HSCs from pediatric SCD patients for molecular and functional hallmarks of senescence, relative to age-
matched controls. We will define more precisely the age of onset of damage to the HSC pool in these young
individuals with SCD using quantitative limiting dilution xenotransplantation and ex vivo single cell assays for
lineage potential. HSPCs isolated from peripheral blood before and after plerixafor-mobilization will also be
studied, as pilot studies suggest that plerixafor mobilizes senescent HSPCs in these patients. Aim 3 will focus
on investigating mechanisms that contribute to premature senescence in SCD HSCs. Here, we will employ
high-resolution microscopy, ex vivo culture, and single cell functional assays to specifically test the hypothesis
that replicative stress and hemolysis contribute directly to premature senescence in SCD HSCs. We will also
test if treatment with hemopexin, which eliminates free heme, can alleviate HSC senescence and restore
function to the HSC pool in mice with SCD."
10931396,"PROJECT SUMMARY – PROJECT 4
The ultimate goal of this proposal is to develop a novel, effective, and safe oncolytic herpes simplex viral (oHSV)-
based immunotherapy for the treatment of glioblastoma (GBM), a highly fatal and the most common malignant
brain tumor. oHSV treatment of GBM relies on cancer-specific replication of the virus leading to tumor destruction
with minimal toxicity to adjacent non-neoplastic tissue. Its safety in patients has been proven, yet efficacy remains
to be improved. Project 4 will focus on enhancing anti-tumor immune responses by arming oHSVs with powerful
immune-modulation payloads by testing two newly generated novel oHSVs, termed OV-Cmab-CCL5 and OV-
αCD47-IgG1, designed to induce immune infiltration and block a checkpoint, respectively, as monotherapies in
addition to their combination. The two oHSVs are expected to synergize with each other to maximize immune
responses in the GBM microenvironment by targeting both immune stimulation and immune suppression to
create an overall pro-inflammatory tumor microenvironment, which has been demonstrated to positively correlate
with patient survival in the rQNestin34.5 clinical trial of Project 2. We generated OV-Cmab-CCL5, an oHSV
expressing a secretable single-chain variable fragment of the epidermal growth factor receptor (anti-EGFR) IgG1
antibody cetuximab linked to CCL5 by an Fc knob-into-hole system that produces heterodimers and prevents
homodimers. To target a checkpoint on innate immune cells, we also engineered oHSV to express a full-length,
soluble anti-CD47 antibody with a human IgG1 scaffold (so-called OV-αCD47-G1), for locoregional control of
GBM. The antibody αCD47-IgG1 secreted by virus-infected GBM cells blocks the CD47 “don't eat me” signal
and exerts additional functions of Fc receptor-mediated antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis by
macrophages and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity by NK cells. Our data show that in GBM mouse
models, both oHSVs reduced tumor size and prolonged survival, owing to enhanced anti-tumor immune
responses. We hypothesize that OV-Cmab-CCL5 is a safe and effective agent that can improve GBM therapy
with multiple mechanisms of action, and the combination therapy of OV-Cmab-CCL5 and OV-αCD47-IgG1 will
have better efficacy than the respective monotherapies. We have manufactured Good Manufacturing Practice
(GMP)-grade viruses at our in-house GMP facility and now propose to conduct Investigational New Drug (IND)
enabling studies so that our innovative oHSVs will be ready for testing in future clinical trials. Project 4 has three
Specific Aims: (1) dissect systemic and regional immune responses, identify a marker(s) in the peripheral blood
of mouse models or clinical samples from Project 2 that correlates with anti-tumor activity, and improve the
efficacy of rQnestin34.5.v2 in GBM mouse models after OV-Cmab-CCL5 treatment; (2) perform IND-enabling in
vivo efficacy and toxicity studies using GMP-grade OV-Cmab-CCL5; and (3) determine the preclinical efficacy
and safety of OV-Cmab-CCL5 combined with OV-αCD47-IgG1. We are confident that our approaches will
provide a novel, effective, and safe oncolytic virotherapy against GBM."

one is to produce transgenic flies, solve the backbone assignments, and find experimental conditions for Cryo-
EM experiments for the LEP-R complexes using transfer electron microscopy (TEM) at the MICRO core at UH.
The long-term aim is to understand LEP-signaling and the role of the diet and microbiome in driving the signaling
behavior. We will define the signaling-complex's molecular details, effects of the gut microbiota’s secreted
enzymes on this complex, and, reciprocally, leptin’s impact on microbiome composition. In this project, we will
characterize human LEP (hLEP) and hLEP-R’s, elucidating the molecular details of LEP-signaling to set the
stage for studies of the links among diet, microbiota, and LEP-R."
10890823,"PROJECT SUMMARY - Determinants of Microbiome Stability Following Pathogen Infection
The human microbiome (i.e., the consortium of microbes that reside in and on the body) affects human health
and development. Microbiome composition (the microbial species that are present) and diversity (the number
of species) can affect microbiome function. Disturbances such as antibiotics, dietary shifts, environmental
stress or pathogen infection can cause changes (perturbations) in the microbiome, which can affect
microbiome function and human health. The impacts of disturbances on the microbiome and human health can
be mitigated by microbiome stability, which is the microbiome’s capacity to maintain stable structure (diversity
and composition) and function despite disturbances. Understanding the factors that control microbiome stability
is therefore important for human health. Infectious disease and temperature stress are two disturbances of
growing concern to human health due to recurring disease outbreaks and human-induced climate change. The
long-term goal of the proposed research is to understand how climate and disease affect the microbiome and
what factors control microbiome resistance and resilience to these disturbances. The specific aims are: (1) to
determine how microbiome diversity and composition affect microbiome stability during pathogen infection; (2)
to determine how long-term temperature change affects the microbiome’s response to pathogen infection. The
project will leverage the model organism Drosophila melanogaster for its tractability and relevance to human
health and wild Drosophila species for their diversity and ecological realism. In Specific Aim 1, Hawaiian
Drosophila species, which have naturally diverse microbiomes, will be used to identify relationships between
microbiome structure (diversity and composition) and stability during infection by a bacterial pathogen. Next,
causal relationships between microbiome structure and stability will be tested by manipulating the microbiome
of D. melanogaster and exposing the flies to the pathogen. Specific Aim 2 will use populations of a single
Drosophila species, which have naturally evolved under different temperatures, to test if adaptation to
temperature affects how the microbiome and host respond to pathogen infection. In both specific aims,
microbiome structure will be measured by DNA sequencing of microbial phylogenetic markers (16S, ITS),
which identify the microbial taxa present and their relative abundances. Microbiome function will be assessed
using shotgun metagenomics and transcriptomics, which predict functional capacity based on gene
orthologues. Pathogen-induced microbiome perturbation will be measured as the change (before and after
infection) in microbiome structure and function. Stability is the inverse of perturbation, i.e., the ability to avoid
change despite disturbance. Effects of microbiome structure on stability will be determined by testing how
microbiome structure prior to infection affects the magnitude of perturbation after infection. This project will
generate knowledge on microbiome structure-stability relationships, which will provide a foundation for future
research to understand the mechanisms underlying stability and resilience and consequences for host health."
10890826,"PROJECT SUMMARY - Social Determinants and Vaginal Microbiome Effects on Preterm Birth in Hawaii
 Preterm Birth (PTB) (delivery of a neonate before 37 weeks gestation) occurs at high rates in Native
Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders in Hawaii (NHPI), resulting in significant long term neonatal morbidity of their
offspring. Strong biologic markers for PTB are present within the maternal vaginal microbiome. A particular
signature of anaerobic species abundance, depletion of Lactobacillus crispatus, and predominance of
Lactobacillus iners results in inflammatory cytokines and metabolites theorized to set off a molecular cascade
leading to preterm labor. Women with Lactobacillus Crispatus predominance have a 75% lower risk of PTB
compared those with vaginal microbial community primarily of Gardnerella or other anerobic species. However,
ethnic variation also exists in vaginal microbiome composition, and it is unknown if this same high risk vaginal
microbiome profile portends similar risk of PTB in NHPI communities. In addition to racial and ethnic variation,
social determinants of health such as income, nutrition, access to healthcare, or effects of systemic racism also
play a role in microbial community composition, and may subsequently contribute to PTB risk.
 The initial goal of this project is to establish vaginal microbiome profiles of women at risk for PTB in
Hawaiʻi. The long-term goal is to create a point of care test to predict PTB using vaginal molecular signals, and
understand inflammatory pathways affected by vaginal dysbiosis that could be modulated with targeted therapy
to prevent PTB. As foundational steps toward this goal, our project will address the following Specific Aims:
1.) Compare vaginal microbial composition in women at risk of PTB among low-risk multiparous women.
Hypothesis: Women who deliver preterm will have higher abundance of Lactobacillus iners or anerobic species
along with inflammatory markers and associated metabolites in early pregnancy. Research Approach: Pregnant
women at risk for PTB and healthy controls will collect vaginal swab samples during mid-gestation (14-22 weeks).
16S sequencing will be performed, alpha and beta diversity profiles assigned, and Community State Types
(CSTs) or predominant species designated. From vaginal swabs, inflammatory cytokines levels will be measured
with multi-plex ELISA; and metabolites measured with mass spectroscopy. These metrics will be compared
among women who did and did not deliver preterm. 2.) Determine the association between social
determinants of health and vaginal microbiota in women who do and do not experience PTB. Hypothesis:
Increased social adversity and stress, unmitigated by resiliency (ability to endure hardship), leading to poor diet
quality, are associated with increased vaginal microbial dysbiosis, and subsequent PTB. Research Approach:
Participants will complete a compilation of surveys including questions pertaining to stress, anxiety, dietary
intake, food insecurity, perceived racism and resiliency. Machine learning techniques will be used to identify a
PTB risk pattern profile incorporating environmental exposures and predominant microbial species."
10897853,"PROJECT SUMMARY
An individuals’ biological sex significantly affects their ability to repair and regenerate tissue. A clear example of
this is the reduced ability for women to heal and regenerate new, healthy tissue after menopause, which results
from a significant loss of sex hormone signaling. This reduction in hormone levels disproportionately enhances
the risk for many degenerative diseases including osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, cardiovascular disease, and
degenerative brain diseases in which the rate of tissue breakdown exceeds the rate of tissue repair. While it is
known that several factors contribute to sex differences in tissue repair including biomechanics, nutrition,
physical activity level and sex hormones, the interplay between these parameters is not well understood.
Specifically, it is unknown how the native sex differences in tissue structure and the resulting differences in
mechanical function dictate cell phenotype and behavior and how this effect interacts with estrogen signaling to
overall control tissue repair. Thus, a fundamental, mechanistic understanding of how a cell responds to the
spatial and mechanical cues of its environment while mediating estrogen signaling is critical to understand why
sex differences occur in tissue repair and homeostasis and for future patient-centered repair and regeneration
strategies. The overall goal of our research program aims to develop biomaterial tools to interrogate sex
differences in tissue repair and homeostasis. Theme 1: Do male and female MSCs respond to spatial and
mechanical properties of the cell microenvironment differently? There is evidence in many tissues that
extracellular matrix structure, organization, and resulting function differs between age-matched males and
females. However, there are no studies showing how this affects cell response. Biomaterials engineered to mimic
both the fibrous properties of structural collagens and the viscoelastic properties of proteoglycans in the native
extracellular matrix will be used to assess sex differences in cell response to controlled changes in matrix
properties. Theme 2: How does estrogen presentation to the cell affect downstream transcription and behavior?
While estrogen is known to play a role on cell processes, these results are dependent on the concentration and
the temporal presentation of estrogen to the cell. To address this limitation, we will use concentration gradient
generator microchips to quickly and accurately determine the effect of estrogen concentration and timing on cell
transcriptional activity. Theme 3: Can we engineer biomaterial systems to control release and presentation of
estrogen to the cells? Release rates in a range of hours to months will be controlled by modulating diffusion out
of the biomaterials via material chemistry and architecture. The ability to control the rate of release and localize
to a specific tissue in the body is critical to promote the estrogen effects at the site while reducing the negative
and potentially deadly off-target effects. Results from these studies will provide future avenues of study to
understand how estrogen and the cell microenvironment drive sex differences in stem cell behavior which is
critical for tissue repair and homeostasis in both women and men."

 Adolescent cannabis use is a major public health crisis. Marijuana laws (ML) carries significant health impli-
cations for American youth. Decriminalization, medicalization, and legalization of cannabis by a majority of US
states over the past 25 years has dramatically shifted societal perceptions and adult use patterns. How mariju-
ana policy changes have affected population-wide health of US youth and the downstream public health impli-
cations of ML remain topics of significant debate. Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit drug by US ado-
lescents and the main drug for which US teens obtain substance use (SU) treatment. Adolescent cannabis use
is associated with negative long-term consequences on mental health outcomes, risk-taking behaviors (eg,
motor vehicle accidents: MVA), and academic/job achievement. Currently, 36 states and the District of Colum-
bia (DC) have enacted medical ML (MML); of these, 18 states and DC have enacted recreational ML (RML).
While studies have assessed the association between MML and marijuana use in youth, little is known about
the impact of ML on mental health outcomes for American youth. No studies to date have evaluated the impact
of MML and RML enactment on youth mental health or mortality outcomes. This represents a major knowledge
gap in research that, if answered, will provide critical information to guide ML policymaking.
 The overarching goal of this NIDA RFA-DA-22-037 application is to characterize the effects of state-level
MML and RML, including degree of ML restrictiveness and the effect of varying provisions, on changes in can-
nabis use disorder (CUD), serious mental illness (SMI), non-cannabis substance use disorder (NCSUD), sui-
cide-related outcomes (SROs), all-cause mortality (ACM), and treatment utilization for SU and MH services,
including prescription medication, in American youth. Our central hypothesis is that ML will increase CUD, SMI,
NCSUD, SROs, and ACM, with less restrictive ML being associated with worse health outcomes. To achieve
study objectives, a difference in difference (DID) quasi-experimental design will be implemented. The main in-
tervention of interest is ML, specifically, enactment of MML and RML. We will use national Medicaid data from
all 50 states and DC for the period 1/1/2008 to 12/31/2020 merged with the National Death Index data. The
study population will include a 20% random sample of all US adolescents (12-17 years) and young adults (18-
25 years) (N=55 million). Medicaid-enrolled adolescents and young adults have higher prevalence rates of
mental health and substance use disorders and poorer physical and mental health outcomes compared to age
matched peers; thus, they are a large and vulnerable population in whom MML and RML effects are unknown.
Multilevel models will be fit to obtain estimates of before vs. after changes among adolescents and young
adults in states enacting MML and RML compared to changes in other states, controlling for Individual and
state-level covariates."

Individuals with criminal justice involvement experience elevated rates of Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) and are
at significantly higher risk of death from opioid overdose in the first year following release from jail/prison.
Medications for OUD (MOUD) are an evidence-based approach to treating OUD and offer extensive benefits
including lowering rates of mortality, illicit opioid use, HIV transmission, violent crime, and arrest. While many
correctional settings have started to implement MOUD, there are significant challenges to continuing
medication/treatment while transitioning back to the community. Intersectional stigma related to addiction and
history of incarceration is associated with greater difficulties with reintegration, increased isolation, and
heightened feelings of loneliness. Lack of social connectedness further serves as a risk factor for decreased
retention in treatment, discontinuation of MOUD, and a return to substance use. Peer support is a key
component of many evidence-based OUD recovery programs. When used in conjunction with MOUD, it has
the potential to improve perceived social support, self-efficacy, and treatment engagement. However, access
to live peer support has been challenged by COVID restrictions, highlighting a critical need for digital health
platforms to deliver peer support. The Marigold Mobile Peer Support (“MPS”) App is a dedicated, secure,
mobile application that employs structured, live peer moderation to guide text-based conversations with groups
of participants and behind-the-scenes natural language processing (NLP) to automatically identify “red flag”
content within peer chats. While initial work demonstrates the utility of deploying the MPS App in outpatient
treatment settings for OUD, it has yet to be tested in correctional settings or among justice-involved
populations. The goal of the proposed application is to advance evidence-based and scalable treatments for
OUD, by decreasing loneliness and enhancing perceived social support via novel application of an established
mobile app among individuals with a history of engaging in MOUD while in jail/prison. The study will be
accomplished through two primary aims: (1) develop an implementation manual to guide delivery of the MPS
App for those with a recent (past year) history of engaging in MOUD while in jail/prison by conducting in-depth
interviews with prospective app users and other key stakeholders; and (2) conduct a randomized controlled
trial to assess feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the MPS App relative to enhanced treatment-
as-usual among individuals with a recent (past year) history of engaging in MOUD while in jail/prison. Findings
from this study will be used to develop a R01 application to conduct a fully-powered Hybrid Type 1
Effectiveness-Implementation study."

Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) affects as many 57% of critically ill children, with mortality rates
as high 67% in those infected. The long-term goal of this proposal, Antibiotics in MODS: PersonaLizing
Exposures (AMPLE), is to leverage the well-established infrastructure from our PARADIGM study
(R01HD095976) to identify optimal antibiotic dosing strategies for this highly understudied, high-risk
population. Infection is a common occurrence in children with MODS, either as an inciting insult or as a result
of a new, nosocomial infection. However, management of children with MODS and infection is complicated by
the development of immune paralysis (IP), which has deleterious effects on immune function. Unfortunately,
antibiotic management strategies and how they should be modified as a function of host immune status are
key knowledge gaps in pediatric MODS. Timely attainment of target antibiotic concentrations is a crucially
important, modifiable intervention to increase survival in these children, yet we currently have limited data on
antibiotic pharmacokinetics (PK) in children with MODS with which to develop personalized dosing strategies.
We will quantify antibiotic PK in 400 subjects enrolled in the PARADIGM study, an ongoing, NIHfunded, 22-
center, prospective study of the epidemiology and risk factors for IP in 1,400 children with MODS.
The objectives of this application are to use samples and clinical data from PARADIGM subjects to
characterize the variability of concentrations for the antibiotics most commonly used in pediatric MODS; to
investigate the relationships between antibiotic target attainment and outcomes in pediatric MODS with and
without IP; and to develop model-based dosing approaches that rapidly achieve and maintain target antibiotic
concentrations. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that precision, PK-driven antibiotic dosing
strategies can be developed that adequately account for organ dysfunction and immune function in children
with MODS. We propose to pursue the following AIMs: 1) To create and evaluate sophisticated population PK
models for the 6 most commonly used antibiotics in pediatric MODS. 2) To define antibiotic target windows
outside of which children with MODS (with and without immunoparalysis) who are being treated for infection
are at increased risk for death and prolonged organ failure. 3) To use simulations to identify dosing strategies
that achieve and maintain antibiotic concentrations within defined therapeutic windows. The proposed studies
will answer the following key questions about the pharmacology of pediatric MODS: 1) What proportion of
children are under- or over- exposed using the current standard dosing approaches?, 2) How does MODS
impact antibiotic PK and outcomes in children?, 3) How does IP impact necessary target concentrations in
pediatric MODS? This research is expected to be significant as it will result in first-of-its kind data that are a
crucial and a necessary step toward developing Precision Antibiotic Dosing strategies for children with MODS."

Engineering trafficking circuits that drive therapeutic T cell infiltration into immune-excluded tumors
Engineered chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have yet to achieve efficacy against solid cancers.
Particularly challenging are immune-excluded “cold” tumors, which fail to accumulate large numbers of infiltrating
T cells. In such cases, even if therapeutic T cells recognize and kill tumor cells in vitro, they will fail in vivo if they
cannot infiltrate the tumor. We propose to engineer synthetic circuits that regulate T cell trafficking as a
general strategy to drive therapeutic T cell infiltration into immunologically cold tumors.
Immune cells naturally rely on complex trafficking behaviors. They patrol the body to surveil for diseases. Once
diseased tissue is identified, they establish local residence and focally expand. Cell trafficking programs largely
rely on regulation of three core cellular functions: 1) chemotaxis (modulating cell ingress and egress), 2) cell-cell
adhesion (reducing cell egress), and 3) local proliferative signaling (cytokine signaling). While these mechanisms
are naturally exploited by T cells, the evolved pathways are susceptible to suppression by numerous tumoral
mechanisms. We hypothesize that synthetic regulatory circuits that directly wire tumor antigen signals to control
therapeutic T cell chemotaxis, adhesion, and local proliferative signaling will improve targeted infiltration of
immune excluded tumors. We propose to develop synthetic trafficking circuit designs through cycles of in silico
modeling and in vitro experiments. We will test if synthetic trafficking circuits can improve CAR T cell efficacy, in
vivo, using an immunocompetent murine model of immune-excluded pancreatic cancer. The resulting cell
trafficking circuits should be applicable to a broad range of solid cancers, as well as other diseases.
AIM 1. Design and characterize synthetic T cell trafficking circuits that coordinately regulate chemotaxis,
adhesion and local proliferation in response to tumor antigen recognition
1.A. Use multi-scale computational modeling to explore design space of possible T cell trafficking circuits. Use
model to identify circuit architectures and parameters that robustly increase tumor-selective infiltration
1.B. Construct a toolbox of modular trafficking circuits using synNotch receptors to control chemotaxis, adhesion,
and proliferation in response to tumor antigen recognition; Construct combinatorial library of circuits.
1.C. Test synthetic trafficking circuits in vitro using multicompartment tissue models that measure T cell trafficking
and migration. Evaluate circuits in vivo by measuring T cell trafficking in bilateral tumor xenograft mouse models.
AIM 2. Use engineered trafficking circuits to improve anti-tumor efficacy in an immune excluded
immunocompetent murine model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.
Leverage synthetic trafficking circuits to improve murine α-Mesothelin CAR-T cell infiltration and clearance of
KPC pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma syngeneic mouse model. Use single cell analysis to assess impact on
tumoral suppressor cells, stroma, host immune cell infiltration, and CAR T cell exhaustion."

research, educational ingenuity and provide substantial resources. This Program offers a spectrum of
training in the following Thematic Focus Areas: Basic Science (training in fundamental mechanisms of
inflammatory vascular injury and repair and oxidative stress/free radical injury); Translational Science
(translation-to-humans, testing basic science discoveries for clinical applicability); Clinical Science (research
to improve knowledge and implementation of new therapies); Population Science (analysis of large-scale
population-based cohort studies). Of the 41 trainees in the past 15 years (12 female, 29 male, 39%
underrepresented minority (URM), 9 MD, 25 PhD, 6 MD/PhD, 1 DrPH), 30 (73%) hold academic positions
(Full, Associate or Assistant Professor, Instructor/Researcher), 8 (20%) are pursuing further training and 3
pursued other positions (physician-scientists). These trainees have 161 peer-reviewed publications, 93 as
first-author, many in leading journals (Circulation, Circ Res, J Biol Chem, Hypertension, J Clin Invest, PNAS

10825434,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Stress is known to dysregulate a range of behaviors, impacting normal responses to environmental stimuli, and
producing long-lasting internal state changes. Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is a stress-associated
neuropeptide and CRF signaling underlies many stress-induced neurobiological changes. Studies have focused
on CRF signaling in the PVN and amygdala. However, within the basal ganglia circuitry, the ventral pallidum
(VP) contains high expression of CRF receptors (CRF1). Yet, CRF-CRF1 signaling within VP remains unstudied.
Stress-induced changes to reward-consumption have been described, but the neurobiological mechanism(s)
underlying these alterations are not fully understood. Activity of a GABAergic VP population projecting to the
nucleus accumbens (ventral arkypallidal) has been shown to potentiate reward consumption. Our preliminary
data suggests that VP CRF1+ cells are part of this ventral arkypallidal population; thus, VP CRF-CRF1 signaling
represents one potential mechanism by which stress potentiates reward consumption behaviors.
This proposal investigates the neurochemical, connectivity, and functional properties of VP CRF1+ neurons. The
central hypothesis of this proposal is that CRF1+ VP neurons are a GABAergic arkypallidal population, and that
CRF1 signaling in these cells increases their overall activity following acute CRF application or stress exposure.
I will determine the abundance, distribution, neurochemical composition, and connectivity of the VP CRF1
population (Aim1). This foundational investigation is important as the identity and connectivity of VP populations
have been shown to impact behavioral output. To probe the electrophysiological properties of this novel
population, I will measure intrinsic excitability and excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in VP CRF1+
and CRF1- cells, both basally and following acute application of CRF (Aim2). This will provide the first evidence
that VP CRF1+ cells are functionally distinct from CRF1- cells and that VP neurons are directly sensitive to CRF.
The mechanism underlying stress-mediated adaptations of VP circuitry is important, as these changes may have
negative consequences for individuals. I will investigate the impact of stress on intrinsic excitability and synaptic
strength of VP CRF1+ and CRF1- populations, and the dependence of these alterations on CRF1 signaling (Aim3).
This will provide evidence that VP is sensitive to stress and undergoes CRF1-mediated functional adaptations
following stress exposure.
With the guidance of my sponsor, Dr. Julia C Lemos, and co-sponsor, Dr. Kevin Wickman, completion of the
proposed study will not only address a crucial scientific question but provide me with extensive technical,
conceptual, and professional training. This research will contribute to the long-term goal of elucidating the
mechanism underlying motivational deficits following stress and my development as an independent researcher."

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune condition that destroys the insulin-producing beta cells within the
pancreatic islets of Langerhans. Although the treatment for T1D is aided with new technology like continuous
glucose monitoring and automated insulin pumps, exogenous insulin administration is the core management
strategy and T1D remains a life-changing and lifelong diagnosis. T1D can be cured by beta cell replacement
through pancreatic islet transplantation, however the need for chronic systemic immunosuppression greatly limits
the applicability of this procedure. Encapsulation of islets within selectively permeable hydrogels prior to
transplantation may eliminate the need for chronic immunosuppression by blocking direct recipient cell and
antibody contact with allogeneic islets. The Tomei lab has developed a unique encapsulation method, “conformal
coating,” that addresses several considerations of traditional encapsulation methods. Altogether, islet
encapsulation has been shown in animal models of T1D to be capable of restoring blood glucose regulation,
however recipient innate and adaptive immune cells including macrophages and T cells still initiate a local
inflammatory and pericapsular response and limit the long-term efficacy of encapsulated islet transplantation.
Given the selective permeability of the hydrogel layer, soluble alloantigens shed by the transplanted islets are
likely triggering an indirect allorecognition pathway, where recipient professional antigen-presenting cells
scavenge and present alloantigens shed by transplanted islets to alloreactive T cells while simultaneously
providing co-stimulatory signal activation. The overall goal of my project is to capitalize on this mechanism by
blocking the co-stimulatory pathways required for T cell activation. I hypothesize that combining encapsulated
islet transplantation with (1) localized and targeted nanoparticle delivery of biologic co-stimulatory blockers
(cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 immunoglobulin) or (2) co-transplantation with immunomodulatory non-
professional antigen presenting cells (that present antigen but do not provide adequate co-stimulation) will induce
deletion/anergy of alloreactive T cells and promote tolerance to transplanted islets, thereby improving and
prolonging their efficacy in restoring physiologic metabolic control."

Giardia lamblia is a single-cell eukaryote that infects hundreds of millions of people every year. Because Giardia
has many molecular pathways that are simplified compared to other eukaryotes, it has potential as a
nontraditional model system for studying the diversity and evolution of key biological processes.
 We recently serendipitously discovered that the 2A ‘self-cleaving’ peptide sequences work very poorly in
Giardia, surprising because 2A peptides are thought to work universally in eukaryotes. Found in picornaviruses
like foot-and-mouth disease virus and poliovirus, 2A peptides are an essential part of the viral life cycle because
they enable two polypeptides to be produced from one open reading frame. Although often referred to as ‘self-
cleaving,’ 2A peptides operate by causing the ribosome to skip a peptide bond. The mechanism of this is
unknown but must involve specific interactions between the 2A nascent peptide chain and the exit tunnel of the
ribosome. Thus, our discovery that 2A peptides work poorly in Giardia points at fundamental differences in its
ribosomes compared to other eukaryotes and can be exploited to understand the mechanism of 2A action.
 Examination of our recently solved structure of the Giardia 80S ribosome reveals a compelling difference
in the structure of ribosome protein uL4 in the exit channel: Giardia lacks a specific loop in uL4. We hypothesize
that this loop is important for the peptide bond-skipping mechanism of 2A peptides, and its absences can partially
explain why 2A peptides operate poorly in Giardia. Here, we will test this hypothesis and in so doing (1) define
the mechanism by which 2A peptides induce bond skipping and (2) determine why it fails in Giardia. We will
combine genetic, biochemical, and structural approaches in two aims. In the first aim, we will determine the
extent to which 2A sequence variants can function in Giardia, with the goal of finding novel efficient and functional
sequences that will serve as powerful tools for Giardia researchers. In the second aim, we will directly test the
functional role of the uL4 loop and solve the structure of a T2A-ribosome complex by cryo-EM with the goal of
describing the mechanism of peptide bond skipping in eukaryotes. Overall, this work will provide critical
knowledge about the function of the Giardia ribosome, the fundamental workings of the eukaryotic translational
machinery, and the mechanism of 2A peptide function. Our discoveries will facilitate the development of Giardia
as a model organism and help lay the foundation for new anti-viral therapeutics that block 2A peptide activity."
10819138,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 In E. coli, cell division occurs at the midcell via initial assembly of the division apparatus into a septal ring
and subsequent septal ring closure. The septal ring contains essential proteins including FtsZ (tubulin homolog
an GTPase), FtsW (glycosyltransferase), FtsI (transpeptidase), and regulators including FtsN and the FtsBLQ
complex. Together FtsW and FtsI form a septal peptidoglycan (sPG) synthase complex (FtsWI) that is essential
for new septum synthesis. Recently, single molecules imaging studies in live E. coli cells revealed three different
states of FtsWI along the septum: two processive moving states and one immobile state. The slow processive
movement of FtsWI is driven by their own sPG synthesis activities by which PG-substrate (Lipid II) is continuously
polymerized and crosslinked to the existing septal cell wall (termed on sPG track). The fast processive movement
of FtsWI is driven by FtsZ’s treadmilling dynamics but not active in sPG synthesis (termed on the Z-track).
Additionally, some FtsWI molecules can display an “immobile” state whereby they remain stationary at septum,
but can transition into the fast- and slow-moving populations. These different mobility states of FtsWI complexes
signal different states of their activities, and hence providing a new way to investigate the activity regulation
pathway of FtsWI at the septum and the corresponding spatiotemporal coordination in septum synthesis.
 The broad goal of this work is to characterize the spatiotemporal regulation of FtsWI in live E. coli cells
and investigate how such regulation impact septum cell wall synthesis and pole morphogenesis. In Aim 1, I will
determine the kinetic pathway of FtsWI activation in live cells by developing a single-molecule imaging and
analysis pipeline and measure transition frequencies between different states and the corresponding state
lifetimes of FtsWI. Using this pipeline, I will investigate how lipid II levels or protein modulators of FtsWI
differentially feed into the regulatory pathway. In Aim 2 I will investigate how the relative distributions of FtsWI
on the sPG and Z-tracks are related to division progression and cell pole morphogenesis. Using a combination
of single molecule tracking, Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM), Scanning Electron Microscopy, and
genetic and growth conditions known to unbalance the ratio of FtsWI on the two tracks, I will determine to what
extent the two tracks are required to maintain balanced rates of septum closure and septum symmetry that give
rise to cell pole shape. Elucidating the kinetic pathway for FtsWI regulation will reveal novel insights regarding
how molecular inputs feed into this dynamic system."
10929995,"SUMMARY | Cellular immunotherapy such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells involves engineering and
adoptive transfer of cells to directly target tumor cells in patient, and demonstrated clinical success. However,
current cell forms of cell therapies face multiple major hurdles, centering around efficient generation of potent,
specific and safe therapeutic immune cells. This R33 will address this significant problem, by developing
and rigorously validating two sets of versatile gene delivery and cell engineering toolkits, to ease the
therapeutic cell generation issue, and to offer a simple yet distinct approach to achieve high potency. Aim
1. Advanced development of MAJESTIC, a highly efficient composite gene delivery system. A vital part of
cellular immunotherapies is therapeutic cell generation. Current approaches, including lentiviral or g-retroviral
vectors, AAV, mRNA, DNA transposons, and genome editing such as CRISPR/Cas, all have their own
limitations. In the first part of this R33, we will perform advanced development and validation of MAJESTIC
technology (mRNA AAV-Sleeping-Beauty Joint Engineering of Stable Therapeutic Immune Cells). This system
can transduce diverse immune cell types with minimal cellular toxicity, leading to highly efficient and stable
therapeutic cargo delivery. Aim 2. Advanced development of synthetic fusion tails to enhance therapeutic
cell function. Despite success in CAR-T therapy in hematopoietic malignancies, major challenges still exist
such as tumor antigen loss, T cell exhaustion, T cell dysfunction, and poor in vivo persistence that hampered its
widespread clinical potential. We seek to develop and validate a distinct approach for cellular engineering to
add to the armamentarium of tools to enhance CAR immune cells against cancer. In the second part of this R33,
we will advance the development of TAILFUSE technology, a novel and unique CAR engineering approach by
cytoplasmic tail (CT) fusions, which reprograms CAR-T function and substantially enhanced in vivo anti-tumor
efficacy. We achieved proof-of-concept development of the technologies (R21/R61 equivalent). In this project
we will perform robust validation, optimization, extension and advanced development (R33). This R33 will mature
these versatile tools for gene delivery and synthetic cell engineering, including quantitative performance
measures, benchmarking, new capability extension, and validation of broader applications to cancer-related cell
types. Success of this R33 will lead to novel technologies that will bring new capabilities, with substantial
improvements over existing technologies. We anticipate wide-spread use of such technologies in laboratory
research and therapeutic development settings by the field to reach transformative impact."

Background: We propose to continue a successful three-day virtual workshop on cancer research skills for
early-career PIs, which we developed as part of the NCI Awardee Skills Development Consortium (UE5
CA246746). The workshop aims to address worrisome declines in the size and retention of the early-career
research workforce by providing training to improve performance and sustainability, grounded in the Job
Demands-Resources Model. The need for this training is clearly demonstrated by the overwhelming demand
for the workshop (three times as many applications as spots), and we observed significant improvements in
targeted skills at 6 months. Based on feedback from all participants and pre-course skills assessments, we
plan to enhance the workshop by including additional content in the form of two elective tracks tailored to
different needs across research areas. Early-career clinical and supportive oncology PIs have a greater need
for additional training in advanced research methods and early-career basic science and translational PIs have
a greater need for training in management skills. Adding elective tracks will allow for targeted content based on
needs, greater contextualization, and increased opportunities for potential collaborations among participants.
Approach and setting: Over the course of five years, we will train 180 early-career PIs with eligible grants in
oncology research. The proposed workshop targets three skill areas that we believe will contribute to long-
term, productive research careers in oncology: 1) advanced research methods to successfully complete funded
studies and grow programs of research in oncology; 2) leadership skills drawn from the Dana-Farber Cancer
for early career faculty; and 3) resiliency skills using the framework of
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). The clinical and supportive oncology elective track will include
recruiting strategies, managing multi-site studies, and building multi-disciplinary teams. The cancer research
management elective track will include training on the financial management of labs, communication with
teams, and managing challenging personnel. The Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) will host this three-day
workshop on Zoom in collaboration with Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), another Dana-
Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (DFHCC) institution. Each day of the workshop, participants attend interactive
didactic sessions and meet in small discussion-based groups with coaching from R01-funded investigators in
oncology. We will work with the Harvard Center for Palliative Care on the promotion, production, and
evaluation of workshop. Faculty: We have assembled an outstanding team of experts in oncology research
training (established independent researchers, grant reviewers, and journal editors) to continue to serve as
workshop faculty. As leaders of highly-productive and well-known programs at DFCI and MGH, the PIs (Drs.
Pirl and Greer) possess the requisite experience and leadership skills to organize this workshop."

While a growing arsenal of drugs is available to treat specific molecular abnormalities across cancers, therapy
effectiveness can now be predicted by detecting specific genomic circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in plasma.
While next-generation sequencing (NGS) can provide a comprehensive readout of genomic tumor variants that
may provide biological and clinical efficacy insights, its cost, complexity, and sample-to-answer timeframe are
not compatible with frequent, routine, point of care diagnostics. Meanwhile, currently available laboratory-based
methods for quantifying strategically-selected ctDNA biomarkers in plasma for liquid biopsy lack sensitivity,
multiplexing, and workflow simplicity required for clinical needs. A genomic liquid biopsy that can be rapidly
performed in a clinical setting in the timeframe of an office visit offers a compelling alternative for identifying the
presence, absence, and concentration changes in circulating nucleic acid molecules whose specific base
sequences represent mutations that drive cancer-associated cellular processes. Such an approach would
enable therapy selection to be performed at the earliest time while facilitating more frequent remission
monitoring. To address the gaps in current technology, we seek to develop and rigorously validate a novel assay
method called “Activate, Cleave, Capture, and Count” (AC3) that combines two innovative elements. First, we
apply a recently-demonstrated photonic crystal (PC) biosensor microscopy technology with digital resolution
capability for quantifying surface-captured gold nanoparticle (AuNP) tags. Second, we utilize the CRISPR/Cas
system with target-specific guide RNA probes that selectively activate cleavage of ssDNA tethers linking AuNPs
to a surface, generating many released AuNPs for each ctDNA molecule. The released AuNPs are subsequently
captured on a PC biosensor, where they are digitally counted. Our ”amplify-then-digitize” strategy offers a
compelling alternative to digital PCR-based technologies while also circumventing the limitations inherent with
thermal amplification, microdroplet partitioning, and fluorescence-based detection. Based upon preliminary
results for the detection of cancer-associated ctDNA, AC3 offers a detection limit of 50 zM and a measurement
of mutant allele frequency of <0.001%. Importantly, AC3 utilizes a small and inexpensive (~ $7K) detection
instrument. In this project, we will apply AC3 for characterization of plasma ctDNA biomarkers across six
mutations and characterize performance using spiked-in calibration standards, and in banked human plasma
samples. We will rigorously characterize the sensitivity, selectivity, and repeatability of AC3 compared to droplet
digital PCR (ddPCR). We envision AC3 as a complement to tissue-based NGS, applied to routine initial cancer
screening for therapy selection, monitoring the effects of treatments, and as a remission monitoring tool.
Compared with alternatives, the inherently greater sensitivity of AC3 offers opportunities to perform earlier cancer
detection, integrate higher levels of multiplexing, and reduce plasma volume requirements."

The proposed project will provide critical information to inform the development and implementation of
interventions to improve the receipt of preventive services among children with sickle cell anemia. National
guidelines strongly recommend that children with sickle cell anemia receive routine screenings and be offered
preventive medications to reduce the risk of serious complications including infections, strokes, and pain
crises. Although these complications are associated with increased health services utilization and cost, and
reduced quality of life, only 40% of children receive routine screenings and less than 20% receive preventive
medications. Significantly, the mechanisms driving quality gaps in the receipt of preventive services are
unknown, limiting our ability to develop and implement impactful interventions. The overall objective of this
study is to shed light on these mechanisms and identify opportunities to optimize receipt of preventive
services among children with sickle cell anemia, thus reducing disease burden and improving quality
of life. The proposed study directly impacts the following AHRQ priority populations: children, racial and ethnic
minorities, low-income patients, and those with special healthcare needs. As such, it aligns with AHRQ’s
mission to improve efficiency and quality of health care delivery for vulnerable populations.
 Using a mixed methods approach, we will (1) identify critical targets within the healthcare delivery
system, as well as key subgroups of the population, through which intervention can improve the receipt of
preventive services for children with sickle cell anemia; (2) identify barriers to and facilitators of receipt of
preventive services, and (3) integrate the quantitative findings of patterns of care and adherence deficiencies
with the qualitative findings of barriers and facilitators to preventive services to identify intervention targets and
strategies that are most likely to improve receipt of preventive services. The mixed methods approach includes
analyzing data from three large complementary, nationally representative datasets, combined with primary
qualitative data collection. The datasets provide a novel opportunity to provide a population-based perspective
on the care of children with sickle cell anemia, as well as national data on prescribing practices. Quantitative
methods, including machine learning and time-dependent survival analysis, will enable us to characterize
patterns of care associated with receipt of preventive services, as well variation in adherence across providers,
patients, caregivers, and insurance type. Qualitative, key informant interviews with provider teams, caregivers,
and patients will identify potential barriers to and facilitators of adherence to each preventive service, as well as
opportunities for intervention. Finally, the visual integration of the quantitative analysis with the qualitative
findings through a joint display will provide essential information regarding which intervention targets and
strategies are most likely to improve receipt of preventive services and ultimately reduce morbidity among
children with sickle cell anemia."

African Americans (AAs) have a high prevalence of hypertension and suffer a disproportionately
high risk for cardiovascular disease compared to whites. Apparent treatment-resistant
hypertension (aTRH) is a severe form of hypertension defined as requiring ≥ 4 antihypertensive
medications to achieve blood pressure (BP) control. An estimated 9 million US adults have
aTRH. Given the rigorous clinical work-up needed to rule out pseudoresistance and therefore,
diagnose true TRH, the population prevalence of TRH is not known. We propose an ancillary
study to the Jackson Heart Study (JHS), a large prospective cohort of AA adults (n=5,306) that
will deeply phenotype participants with aTRH, ruling out pseudoresistance (i.e., inaccurate clinic
BP measurement, presence of a white coat effect, suboptimal antihypertensive therapy, and
poor medication adherence) and secondary causes of hypertension (i.e., primary aldosteronism,
obstructive sleep apnea, and kidney disease). The JHS provides a highly feasible setting for
the proposed study as it includes a large population of AAs with a high prevalence of
hypertension and extensive data collection as part of an upcoming fourth parent study visit,
which will facilitate the screening and recruitment of participants for our ancillary study. Based
on data collected during the fourth JHS exam, we will identify 400 participants with aTRH and
200 treatment-responsive controls. These participants will undergo a clinical evaluation for TRH
including assessment of existing ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) data to detect white coat
effect and urinalysis of antihypertensive drugs and metabolites to assess medication adherence.
Also, participants with aTRH will be compared to treatment responsive controls with respect to
secondary causes of hypertension and lifestyle factors. Clinical translation of the study findings
will be facilitated by an external panel of experts who co-authored the American Heart
Association 2018 Scientific Statement on Resistant Hypertension. Overall, the diagnosis and
treatment of TRH is limited by our understanding of pseudoresistance and other factors
underlying aTRH. The proposed study is urgently needed to more efficiently diagnose and
better treat this severe form of hypertension among African Americans."

 The renal maintenance of acid-base homeostasis is critical for optimal health. Collecting duct intercalated
cells play a central role in this process through adaptive changes in proton secretion, bicarbonate secretion, and
Rh glycoproteins-mediated ammonia transport. Our current paradigm is that the primary determinant of this
response involves direct effects of extracellular pH on intercalated cells.
 We suggest a new paradigm. Deletion of the proximal tubule-specific basolateral bicarbonate
transporter, NBCe1-A, causes severe metabolic acidosis, yet inhibits intercalated cell phenotypic characteristics
of acid secretion and inhibits the intercalated cell plasticity response to acid-loading. This is not an off-target
effect of the TALEN gene-editing procedure; identical effects were seen with NBCe1-A/B deletion generated
using Cre-lox techniques. Published work shows that the K+ disorders, hypokalemia and hyperkalemia, alter
intercalated cell phenotype and plasticity in a pattern which cannot be explained by extracellular pH. The effects
of NBCe1-A or NBCe1-A/B deletion, or of K+ disorders likely involve ammonia. Each alters proximal tubule-
derived ammonia generation in a pattern which parallels the observed intercalated cell responses. Isolated
perfused collecting duct studies show ammonia acutely and directly regulates intercalated cell H⁺ and
bicarbonate transport. Thus, we propose a new paradigm, that proximal tubule-derived ammonia, which is
concentrated in the renal interstitium by the TAL, is a primary determinant of intercalated cell phenotypic
characteristics and plasticity response. Our proposed studies investigate this new paradigm in detail.
 Specific Aim 1 will determine the effect of gene deletion maneuvers which directly and specifically alter
proximal tubule and thick ascending limb ammonia metabolism on intercalated cell phenotype and plasticity. We
will use a combination of gene deletion approaches, including proximal tubule-specific deletion of PDG, the initial
and the rate-limiting enzyme in ammoniagenesis, and TAL NHE4 deletion, which directly impacts ammonia
concentration into the renal interstitium where we propose it regulates intercalated cells. We will study the effect
of these gene deletion so in a variety of conditions, including basal state, acid-loading, and abnormal potassium
homeostasis, both hypokalemia and hyperkalemia.
 Specific Aim 2 will determine the signaling mechanisms through which proximal tubule regulates
intercalated cell phenotypic characteristics and plasticity. We will identify whether this is direct stimulator of
pathways or acts parallel to and independent of signaling pathways known to alter intercalated cells, including
GDF15, hensin, GPR4, and SDF1.
 These studies will substantially advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating
thereby acid-base homeostasis."

The Molecular Biology Shared Resource (MBSR) was created in 2009 to bring together into one consolidated
operation the Genomics Facility and the Molecular Biology/High-Throughput Screening (MB/HTS) Facility. The
merger enhanced the communication between the cores, maximized the utilization of staff expertise, and
raised the quality of services used by representatives of all Cancer Center programs. The MBSR offers: 1)
next-generation sequencing (Illumina), single-cell genomics (10xGenomics), NanoString targeted gene
expression assays, and Sanger sequencing; 2) genome-wide siRNA and small-molecule chemical (>100K)
HTS screening, 3) high-content imaging and analysis, and 4) multi-analyte profiling using Luminex xMAP
technologies. The resource provides free consultation to every researcher regarding experimental design,
budget estimates, results, and data assessment, and is a significant resource for molecular biological reagents,
information, and training in molecular biological techniques and analysis software. The MBSR is under the
direction and oversight of two Co-Directors who manage the day-to-day activities of the Facility. In this regard,
Dr. David Kelly oversees the MB/HTS Facility located in the BCC, and Dr. James Eudy oversees the Genomics
Facility located in the Durham Research Center II, both on the UNMC campus. Six technical staff members are
employed in the MBSR with personnel extensively cross-trained to perform virtually all services and to operate
virtually all instrumentation and equipment. The MBSR is one of the most widely used BCC Shared Resource,
supporting over 184 biomedical laboratories in the UNMC research community, of which approximately 53%
are laboratories led by BCC investigators in the BCC research programs (Targets, Probes, and Delivery,
Cancer Biology Program, and Gastrointestinal Cancer Program). To meet the rapidly changing needs of and to
inform BCC investigators, the MBSR personnel conduct workshops, speak at local seminars, attend Cancer
Center program meetings and multi-investigator project meetings, and present at laboratory meetings.
Moreover, they attend national and regional technology conferences to learn the latest technologies,
techniques, and methods."

10897791,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This R01 application is responsive to the NIH initiative PAR-19-253 “Focused Technology Research and
Development”. Automated liquid handling technologies are valuable in many areas of biomedical research. For
example, robotic pipetting systems have been extensively utilized to automate assays, thereby eliminating errors
associated with manual pipetting and significantly improving reproducibility. However, the majority of automated
liquid handling technologies suffer from a fundamental constraint: they rely on physical contact with a solid
structure in order to manipulate liquid reagents. Therefore, traces of a reagent inevitably adsorb onto the contact
surface and can possibly later dissolve into another liquid sample. Thus, the risk of cross-contamination due to
this undesirable “fouling of the surface” limits the transport surfaces to a single type of working liquid plus reagent
combination. Recently, we invented digital acoustofluidics (DAF), an acoustic-based, programmable, contact-
free, liquid handling technology, which overcomes the key obstacles associated with the existing liquid handling
methods. In this R01 project, we will develop and validate a DAF fluid processing system with the following
features: (1) Rewritability, programmability, and ability to perform complex, cascade reactions: We will
demonstrate the ability of DAF to transport and mix ‘fluidic bits’ (i.e., droplets) along prescribed, arbitrary routes
without cross-contamination, leading to a 104-fold increase in the number of allowable combinations of reagent
inputs on a single device (as compared with conventional platforms); (2) Biocompatibility: Instead of being
directly subjected to strong acoustic pressure or high electric fields, the droplets are manipulated in a
contactless, gentle manner. Our preliminary results show that the DAF platform has no significant effect on the
viability of cells; (3) Versatility: DAF is not restricted to fluids with specific acoustic, electrical, hydrodynamic, or
magnetic properties. This versatility makes DAF suitable for handling a wide range of liquids, even for challenging
samples such as low-polarity fluids (e.g., organic solvents), sticky or viscous samples (e.g., blood and sputum),
and solids (e.g., fecal samples and model organisms); (4) Miniaturization and convenient integration: Our
DAF platform provides an unprecedented level of miniaturization and cost-effectiveness compared with existing
robotic liquid handling systems. In addition, it is designed to be integrated with a variety of multi-well plates,
enabling it to be seamlessly integrated into existing biomedical research laboratories. With the aforementioned
advantages, the proposed DAF technology has the potential to exceed current industry standards, address
unmet needs in the field, and provide a compelling platform for the development of a robust, rewritable, high-
throughput, and digitally-programmable fluidic processor. We will validate its performance across two established
biomedical applications: protein crystal chemistry, and high-throughput drug screening. In this regard, we aim to
demonstrate the far-reaching potential of DAF to enable improved research in areas ranging from clinical
chemistry to fundamental biology."

 The suffering caused by Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the greatest medical challenges of our time.
With a heightened sense of urgency, numerous AD prevention trials are being launched, requiring an
unprecedented number of healthy older adults to be screened to identify the thousands eligible to participate.
At the same time, the number of trials in affected individuals and their care partners continues to rise. In 2019,
there were 156 trials for the treatment of AD, an increase from 2018. Notably, this number does not include
observational studies, which are also important to understanding AD and developing new interventions to treat
or prevent it. Improving participant recruitment methods has become a critical priority for the field. Initiatives
such as the National Plan to Address AD call for greater attention to increasing enrollment into clinical trials
and other clinical research. An outgrowth of the National Plan is the National Strategy for Recruitment and
Participation in Alzheimer's Disease Clinical Research which enumerated four goals, one of which is focused
specifically on the need to “build and improve research infrastructure of registries in order to recruit and retain
more and more diverse qualified study participants.” The objective of this proposal is to develop, deploy,
optimize and automate new website design/content, infrastructure and functionality to support and sustain
online recruitment, engagement, and retention of adults interested in participating in AD-focused studies,
creating a sustainable and enduring resource to researchers. To accomplish this, we will build off our
successful Alzheimer's Prevention Registry (APR), an online registry launched in 2012 with >350,000
members, including ~90,000 enrolled in its GeneMatch (GM) program launched in 2015 via the following aims:
1) develop, deploy, optimize and automate a refreshed and sustainable website platform for the recruitment
into and engagement of members in the APR and its GM program; 2) develop, deploy, optimize and automate
a refreshed website platform supporting researchers' efforts to recruit APR and GM members; and 3) develop,
deploy, optimize and automate new functionality and processes for referring APR and GM members to AD-
focused studies. We hypothesize that the a) refreshed website will increase enrollment into the APR and GM
as well as engagement and retention of members; b) enhanced AD-Researcher experience will increase the
number of researchers / study sponsors leveraging the APR/GM for their participant recruitment needs,
allowing them to complete enrollment faster; and c) new functionality will increase the percentage of APR and
GM members screening for and enrolling in AD-focused studies."
10909277,"Abstract
Microglia are tissue macrophages that reside in the central nervous system (CNS) and perform unique and
critical auxiliary functions important to CNS development, homeostasis, immunity and repair. These roles, along
with the progressive appreciation that microglia can contribute to neurological disease processes, provides a
compelling case to more clearly understand the mechanisms that regulate their development and functions.
Major unanswered questions include determining the combination of signals within the brain that trigger the
differentiation of erythromyeloid progenitor (EMP) cells to become mature microglia and how alterations in these
signals specify distinct microglia phenotypes in health and disease. Studies performed under the support of this
grant for the past four years provide the foundations for addressing these questions. Four Specific Aims are
proposed. Specific Aim 1 is to define expression and chromatin Quantitative Trait Loci and collaborative
transcription factors in human microglia. These studies will generate a valuable resource for the neuroscience
community and inform studies in Aims 2, 3 and 4. Specific Aim 2 is to define cis regulatory elements that mediate
brain environment-dependent regulation of microglia gene expression, focusing on the microglia-specific lineage
determining factor SALL1. Importantly, our experimental plan will exploit the recent ability to achieve an in vivo
human microglia phenotype within the mouse brain as the context for analysis of the function of environment-
dependent enhancers. Specific Aim 3 is to test the hypothesis that brain environment-dependent genes can be
activated in iPSC-derived microglia in vitro by conditional expression of environment-dependent transcription
factors. Forced expression of these factors in human iPSC-derived microglia in vitro will provide insights into
their molecular functions and may enable development of improved in vitro microglia model systems. Specific
Aim 4 is to perform in vivo ASO-mediated loss of function experiments to identify transcriptional mediators of
brain environmental factors. This aim is based on advances in anti-sense oligonucleotide (ASO) chemistry that
now make it possible to use ASOs to significantly alter gene expression in microglia and other cell types of the
brain in vivo. In concert, the proposed studies are intended to qualitatively advance understanding of
mechanisms that establish the brain environment dependent program of human microglia gene expression."
10889193,"Project Summary/Abstract
This project aims to develop a novel MRI-compatible robotic system with an integrated imaging coil array to
enable in-bore real-time interventional procedures, improve the targeting accuracy, shorten the pre-operative
path planning time, and intra-operative surgery time. Currently, neurosurgeons often use pre-operative MRI to
plan the path manually and place the instrument in the brain outside of the MRI room either manually using a
passive stereotactic frame, or by using non-MRI compatible robots such as ROSA. Performing neurosurgical
procedures using real-time MRI-guidance requires an enabling technology for in-bore interventions. Although an
MRI-compatible commercial device has been recently introduced, ClearPoint, for real-time MRI-guided
targeting, it is passive and thus requires time consuming manual adjustment. It is also not appropriate for multi-
target application as it is locally mounted on the skull. For tumor biopsy and ablation, path planning currently
requires the neurosurgeon to perform extensive manual preoperative planning which can require one hour or
more. Despite extensive pre-planning, intra-operative re-planning is sometimes required once the skull is
opened. Lastly, current imaging head coils have been designed specifically for diagnostic procedures,
encompassing the patient’s head and limiting access to the surgical area. Consequently, current procedures are
time-intensive, especially for multi-target procedures. There are no existing medical device technologies that can
address all the major neurosurgery challenges of: 1) lengthy blind procedure time for single-/multi-target
procedures, 2) limited brain access due to the MR imaging coil, and 3) extensive manual path planning. We
propose to develop an MRI-compatible and low-profile novel robotic system with embedded movable coil array
for real-time in-bore application featured with automatic path planning techniques. The specific aims of the
proposed research are to (1) Design, construct, and test an MRI-compatible robot with an automatic path planner,
(2) Develop an embedded MR coil array, and (3) Integrate the system components and evaluate the system
accuracy. The successful completion of the proposed project will provide the necessary technical feasibility and
workflow validation information to support development of clinically viable system for human trial in the next
phase."
10906346,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PNCD) affect about 25% of patients in the period
following surgery, and can persist for months or years in 10% of geriatric surgical patients. The
presence of acute cognitive disturbances post-surgery increases the risk of patients eventually
developing dementias such as Alzheimer's disease. Poor cognitive outcomes lead to longer
hospital stays, decreased quality of life, and increased morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately,
about half of elderly individuals require a surgical procedure at some time in their remaining
years, and no interventions exist to prevent PNCD because the etiology is unclear. One of the
main challenges in identifying the factors leading to chronic cognitive impairment is the lack of
routine, comprehensive cognitive testing in the surgical care plan. This shortcoming is in part
due to the lack of mobile, easy-to-use cognitive testing platforms. To establish the perioperative
biomarkers contributing to cognitive decline, we will (1) integrate routine, comprehensive
cognitive testing pre- and post-surgery, and (2) build a database and an analysis platform to
mine this multidimensional dataset. Together, this aims to yield accurate models to pre-identify
patients at risk and create targeted therapeutic interventions.
We propose to build the foundational infrastructure for a precision medicine approach in
geriatric surgical patients. In the R21 phase, we will build a novel comprehensive database of
demographic and risk factor questionnaire responses, banked blood specimens, intraoperative
electroencephalography (EEG), and inclusive cognitive testing. These data will be collected
throughout the patient interaction, from the preoperative appointment through a year following
the surgical procedure and available to other research teams. We will incorporate cognitive
testing and collect large-scale data in the geriatric surgical setting, establishing a new precedent
for subsequent multidisciplinary studies. This structure will afford us the opportunity to
accurately track cognitive decline towards chronic conditions, such as dementia.
In the R33 phase, we will develop an analysis platform capable of mining this multidimensional
dataset. This phase will include EEG analysis and deep immune profiling using mass cytometry.
Layered on these analyses we will build innovative machine learning tools to identify features
and interactions contributing to both acute and chronic PNCD pathology. Our novel machine
learning tools use prior knowledge to refine feature selection, thus addressing a common
challenge faced by clinical research studies (having many measurements in a limited patient
population), and will thus be of broad interest to other clinical research projects."
10910910,"With current treatment regimens, long-term remission rates for adult patients with high risk
Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) are 15-25%. RUNX1 is the DNA-
binding subunit of the core-binding factor (CBF) complex and a master-regulator transcription factor
involved in hematopoiesis. Majority of mutant (mt) RUNX1 are missense, large deletions or truncation-
mutations, behaving mostly as loss of function (LOF) mutations. Presence of mtRUNX1 confers relative
therapy-resistance and poorer survival in patients with MDS/AML. The germline mutations and deletions
in RUNX1 cause the highly penetrant (~40%) Familial Platelet Disorder with a propensity to evolve into
MDS or AML. Lack of specific targeted therapy, coupled with resistance to standard therapy may account
for poorer prognosis and outcome in MDS/AML expressing somatic or germline mtRUNX1. Therefore,
there is an unmet need to develop novel targeted therapies for MDS/AML expressing mtRUNX1. Our
preliminary studies demonstrate that knockdown of RUNX1 induces significantly more in vitro lethality in
AML blasts expressing mtRUNX1 versus wild type (wt) RUNX1. Utilizing RNA-Seq signature of RUNX1
knockdown and querying the LINCS1000-CMap (Connectivity-Mapping) datasets, we identified
homoharringtonine (HHT) among the top expression mimickers (EMs). Consistent with observations that
presence of mtRUNX1 impairs ribosomal biogenesis (RiBi), treatment with HHT or its semisynthetic
analog omacetaxine mepesuccinate (OM), which inhibit protein translation, preferentially exerted more
lethality in vitro and efficacy in vivo in models of AML expressing mtRUNX1. This was associated with
repression of RUNX1 and its targets, as well as attenuation of short-lived proteins including c-Myc and
MCL-1. Notably, co-treatment with OM and venetoclax (Ven) induced synergistic lethality and superior in
vivo efficacy in xenograft models of AML expressing mtRUNX1. Therefore, our Overarching hypothesis
motivating studies proposed is that targeted combination of OM and Ven will yield high remission rates
and improved survival, correlating with specific genetic and gene-expression signatures in patients with
high-risk MDS/AML expressing mtRUNX1. Specific aims of studies proposed are: AIM 1: To conduct a
Phase Ib/II clinical trial of co-treatment with OM and Ven in patients with high risk MDS or AML expressing
mtRUNX1. AIM 2: To determine correlates of efficacy/resistance to co-treatment with OM and Ven,
including genetic-lesions architecture (via NextGen and scDNA sequencing), epigenetic and gene-
expression signature (via RNA-Seq, RPPA and CyTOF analyses) and impaired RiBi features in MDS/AML
cells of patients enrolled on the Phase Ib/II trial. AIM 3: To determine pre-clinical efficacy of additional
OM-based combinations with BET or CDK9 inhibitor, as well as with novel targeted agents directed
against druggable hits nominated through an in vitro protein domain-specific CRISPR-gRNA screen."

Lipids represent a diverse class of biomolecules that are the building blocks of cell membranes. In recent years,
alterations in lipid composition have been identified as hallmarks of numerous diseases, ranging from type 2
diabetes to neurodegenerative disorders. However, understanding the functional roles of bulk membrane lipids
has long been a challenge, in part due to the difficulties of manipulating and imaging them in cells. Our laboratory
applies genetic and chemical tools to study lipid function and develop biophysical models for membrane-
associated cellular processes. The proposed research program will carry out this approach to identify how two
disease-associated lipid perturbations alter the behavior of cellular compartments. In the first thrust, we will use
effects of saturated phospholipids on membrane viscosity to uncover how structure and dynamics control
respiratory metabolism. Specifically, we will engineer inner mitochondrial membrane composition in both yeast
and mammalian cell lines and use this perturbation to dissect the contributions of diffusion and supramolecular
assembly to the electron transport chain. This effort will uncover the function of conserved features of mammalian
mitochondria, such as respiratory supercomplexes, and test how increases in saturated lipids caused by
metabolic disorders could directly contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction. In the second thrust, we will use a
genetic system to interrogate the function of 1-deoxysphinglipids, non-canonical products of serine-
palmitoyltransferase that have been associated with several genetic and metabolic disorders. We will focus on
how synthesis of 1-deoxysphinglipids dysregulates the endomembrane system in retinal pigment epithelium
cells, which have been linked to adult-onset blindness caused by 1-deoxysphinglipid accumulation. Development
of new imaging approaches will broaden the impact of this thrust to the emerging biomedical roles for these
enigmatic lipids. If executed, the research program will thus generate models for two sets of lipids molecules and
their cellular points of action in both healthy and diseased cells. Our long-term goal is to understand how changes
in lipid composition across organelles, cells, and tissues arise and function, and use this knowledge to uncover
the molecular mechanisms underlying membrane biology."

Approximately 10% of reproductive-aged women are diagnosed with endometriosis, an inflammatory, estrogen-
dependent disorder characterized by endometrial tissue outside the uterus. This is likely an underestimate of the
frequency. In the absence of molecular biomarkers of this disease, the “gold standard” for diagnosis is histologic
confirmation of the lesions via invasive surgical procedures (laparoscopy or laparotomy), which delays diagnosis.
Accordingly, Project 2 will use mass spectrometry (MS)-based, global approaches to compare the proteomes
of endometriotic lesions with eutopic endometrium from patients or women without disease with the goal of
identifying protein biomarkers that enable better stratification of the disease phenotypes. Additionally, we will
apply innovative computational methods to correlate the results with multiple molecular profiles (proteins,
environmental chemicals [ECs] and metabolites) in patient and control sera, which could enable novel diagnostic
strategies. This experimental strategy reflects the fact that endometriosis significantly alters the proteome of the
affected cells. Also, ECs have been associated with the disease. For example, Drs. Giudice and Fisher reported
alterations in the tissue proteome (fat) of women with endometriosis that correlate with EC exposures. With
regard to other small molecules, recent studies suggest shifts in tissue metabolites may manifest in the blood of
endometriosis patients. As such they may be linked to the disease process. Our overall strategy derives from
the fact that MS-based analyses at a global level are transforming investigators' ability to explicate complex
disease phenotypes. In this context, Specific Aim 1 will identify differentially expressed (DE) proteins in lesions,
eutopic samples and sera that are associated with endometriosis using a MS-based approach for relative
quantification. Specific Aim 2 will identify metabolomic and exposomic features in banked serum samples from
endometriosis patients vs. control individuals. Specific Aim 3 will apply machine learning-based approaches to
the -omic datasets generated in this project to define phenotypic molecular signatures of endometriosis that
could aid in disease classification and diagnosis. The major significance of the proposed experiments is that we
are redefining the landscape of endometriosis, using a precision medicine approach. Moreover, our data will
reveal effectors with roles in the heterogeneous clinical manifestations of endometriosis that can be targets for
diagnostic modalities and therapeutic interventions. As shown by the preliminary data, the members of the
Project 2 team have extensive experience with the proposed technologies and computational strategies in other
contexts. Regarding innovation, to our knowledge this is the first time that a multi-dimensional, multi-disciplinary
approach to endometriosis will be pursued by using advanced computational, machine learning-based
unsupervised methods to coalesce high order data sets. We believe the results will enable a predictive, non-
invasive approach to detect endometriosis and reveal potential biomarkers, contributing factors underlying
disease, and therapeutic targets."

Endometriosis is a common, estrogen-dependent, inflammatory disorder that causes debilitating chronic pelvic
pain including severe dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia, infertility, and a reduced quality of life for 176 million
women and teens worldwide. Treatment of endometriosis-associated pain is mainly surgical and/or medical.
Surgical removal of disease results in 50% relapse of pain within 2-5 years. Medical treatments, largely
unchanged over decades, comprise nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and hormones that lower
estrogen levels or oppose its actions, and result in variable symptom relief. The development and availability of
large-scale genomic, transcriptomic, and other molecular profiling technologies, in combination with the
deployment of the network concept of drug targets and the power of phenotypic screening, provide an
unprecedented opportunity to advance rational drug repurposing and data-driven development of drug
combinations. The goal of Project 3 is to leverage endometriosis transcriptomics data combined with publicly
available drug screening data and apply a computational drug-repurposing pipeline to identify single agent and
combination therapies from existing drugs based on expression reversal perturbing molecular networks away
from disease-associated cellular dysfunction, and validate select drugs in human endometrial cells in vitro and
an animal model of endometriosis pain. In Aim 1, we will use transcriptomic-based computational drug-
repurposing to identify potential new single agent and combination therapeutics based on expression reversal
leveraging public transcriptomics data. Our hypothesis is that the inverse expression profiles between the drug
repositioning candidates and the disease signatures will result in therapeutic predictions. In Aim 2, we will
determine the capacity of compounds of interest (COIs) to inhibit inflammatory signaling responses in primary
human immune and endometrial cells through the use of an ex vivo high-throughput mass-tag barcoding assay.
We hypothesize that the most promising COIs identified in silico (Aim 1) will improve endometriosis symptoms
by inhibiting pro-inflammatory signaling responses in endometrial and/or immune cells. Finally, in Aim 3 we will
determine the efficacy of compounds of interest to alleviate pain in a preclinical endometriosis model. We
hypothesize that the COIs identified for the treatment of endometriosis will alter the endometriotic
microenvironment to alleviate pain. We anticipate this study will serve as the basis for studies on newly
discovered novel targets and drug-repurposing as well as functional validation in endometrial tissue as well as
testing in preclinical models, and if successful, clinical trials for endometriosis-associated pain in women. We
hope that this novel approach will change the paradigm of “one size fits all” hormonal treatment for
endometriosis-associated pelvic pain and expand therapeutic options to new therapies and established therapies
repurposed to improve the lives of millions of affected women and teens and expand the research pipeline in
this space."

AI4ALL high school initiative. Through these programs, we will continue to provide an innovative, formal,
intensive summer research and didactic experience that educates and trains students in various aspects of
endometriosis research. A specific focus of our outreach core will be understanding the needs of various
stakeholders and promoting the inclusion of diverse and underrepresented communities in our research projects,
training programs, and dissemination of ENACT project findings. As such, partnering with our UCSF Center of
Excellence in Women's Health and Black Women's Health and Livelihood Initiative, we will create a cross-
disciplinary advisory board and use their input and the results of an advisory board informed questionnaire to
understand the needs of the endometriosis community and advocates to inform our above efforts. All projects

 Opioids acting at the mu opioid receptor (MOR) remain the gold standard for treatment of
moderate to severe pain relief, but their use is limited by serious side effects, particularly abuse
liability. The opioid epidemic has grown steadily in the past three decades, resulting in 137
deaths per day. In this program, we will test modifications of the core pharmacophore of an
endomorphin analog that has been shown to provide pain relief comparable to morphine while
exhibiting reduction of several side effects, including abuse liability. A series of glycosylated
analogs of endomorphin, designed to enhance blood-brain-barrier penetration, will be tested.
Preliminary tests indicate highly effective acute antinociception/pain relief for 2 of these
compounds. We will identify 3 candidate compounds and assess them for low abuse liability in
rodent models that correlate with human abuse liability. We will then test for reduction of
tolerance and respiratory depression relative to currently used opioids, and effective relief of 3
forms of pain ranging from moderate to chronic duration. Pharmacokinetic profiles will enable
planning of human studies. The goal of this project is to show proof-of-concept that these novel
endomorphin analogs can provide effective treatment of pain without rewarding properties and
other key adverse effects. Successful outcomes of this project will support development of these
compounds for clinical use as novel treatments for pain and potentially for opioid use disorder."

conceptualization and feasibility assessment through to the final verification of targets identified in the screens. 
The Core utilizes the extensive amount of HTS equipment available in the Prebys Center and the Chemical 
Library Screening Core. In addition to the wealth of expertise brought by the staff, the Core serves as a repository 
for reagents, assays, and technical information, which are shared with Cancer Center researchers. The Core 
provides a variety of libraries for functional genomics analysis, including a genome-wide siRNA library, and 
comprehensive miRNA activator and inhibitor libraries, broad shRNA libraries, as well as targeted arrayed and 
genome-wide pooled CRISPR libraries. The Core's primary effort is dedicated to genetic screening via RNAi and 
CRISPR-Cas9, although significant time is also currently dedicated to engineering of cell lines. Within the Core, 
the main laboratory focuses on cellular genetics, while the viral vector laboratory specializes in high-quality vector 
preparation in a centralized facility with expert staff, and produces an array of sophisticated viral systems to 
enable nucleic acid delivery. Both laboratories are also actively involved in developing tools tailored to the

through GC-MS analysis or a 96-well YSI analyzer. In the past funding period (the first for this Shared Resource), 
a variety of enhancements have been made in quantification of metabolites such as fatty acids (including short- 
chain fatty acids), cholesterol, sugars, and sugar phosphates, as well as more standard detection of glucose,

where(13C, 15N, 2H)-labeled substrates can be traced to metabolites such as TCA cycle intermediates and fatty 
acids, which provides information on metabolic pathway flux that provides insight beyond metabolite 
quantification alone. The third major analytical platform in the Core is a Seahorse XFp Extracellular Flux 
Analyzer, purchased in 2015, which allows real-time measurement of cellular oxygen consumption and 
extracellular acidification. Mitochondrial function and the relative contribution of glycolysis and oxidative 
phosphorylation to ATP production can be measured in live by sequential addition of various mitochondrial 
inhibitors or uncouplers. Over the last 5 years, the Cancer Metabolism Core has provided services to 24 Cancer 
Center members, and supported at least 20 publications"
10862847,"ABSTRACT – DEVELOPMENTAL FUNDS 
Developmental Funds are critical for implementing and advancing the strategic initiatives and addressing the 
growing needs of the Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute Cancer Center. Developmental 
Funds are distributed after requests undergo evaluation and review by the Cancer Center Leadership Team 
(CCLT), with the final decision to approve funding being made by the Director. Developmental Funds are often 
combined with, and used to leverage, institutional and philanthropic support, thereby maximizing their impact. In 
the previous grant cycle, funds were used to support the recruitment of six new faculty members, to fund 25 new 
collaborative pilot projects, and to continue support for three pilot projects initiated in the prior funding cycle. As 
such, Developmental Funds are an essential part of the plan to achieve the Center's strategic goals. Pilot projects 
are funded based on the quality of the science, the anticipated contribution to one or more strategic goals, and 
the potential for securing federal funding, especially from NCI. Projects funded by this program have brought 
together scientists with diverse expertise and introduced a new cadre of scientists to cancer research. The pilot 
projects offer a tangible mechanism for promoting research in priority areas established by the CCLT. In the last 
cycle, the funded projects resulted in 15 publications and 12 awarded grants in the amount of $14.8M (total 
costs). The newly recruited faculty successfully obtained peer-reviewed funding during this period, with direct 
grant revenue of $12.9M (total costs). Thus, an initial investment of CCSG funds of $1.9M yielded a return of 
$27.7M, representing a ratio of 14:1. During the next project period, support is requested for four pilot projects 
annually. In addition, we plan to recruit 13 new investigators based on the Cancer Center's new 5-year Strategic 
Plan, focusing on the priority areas designated by each of the three programs. We are requesting CCSG support 
at less than 15% of the expected total recruitment costs for two new faculty members per year. The balance of 
the recruitment costs, including all capital equipment, will be provided by SBP as part of the Institute's 
commitment to Center initiatives. The current request for Developmental Funds in combination with the continued 
commitment of institutional funds will allow the Director and CCLT to continue the strategic development of the 
Cancer Center faculty and research."
10862849,"ABSTRACT – LEADERSHIP, PLANNING AND EVALUATION 
The goal of the Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute Cancer Center's planning process is to 
strategize and prioritize programmatic development, intra- and inter-programmatic activities, and Center-wide 
activities. Effective planning and evaluation processes enable the Center to fulfill its vision of making paradigm- 
shifting discoveries that will underlie novel therapeutic modalities by creating, translating, and disseminating 
exceptional cancer basic science. The Cancer Center has established a coordinated and multilayered planning 
and evaluation process. The de facto Cancer Center Executive Committee is the Cancer Center Leadership 
Team (CCLT) chaired by the Director and comprising the Deputy Director, the three Associate Directors (Shared 
Resources, Education and Career Enhancement, and Administration), and the three Program Leaders, who 
provide scientific guidance, direction, and advice to the Director. The CCLT receives input from the Shared 
Resources Team chaired by the Associate Director for Shared Resources, and the Administrative Team chaired 
by the Associate Director for Administration. Advice on programmatic and thematic development, recruitment, 
and funding of pilot projects is solicited from the Cancer Center External Advisory Board (EAB) through an annual 
meeting and on an as-needed basis. Review shows that the goals of the 2014 Cancer Center 5-year Strategic 
Plan were fully achieved in terms of recruitment of seven new faculty in four defined growth areas (metabolism, 
epigenetics, immunology and bioinformatics), increased access to human tissues through arrangements with 
two local hospital systems, GEM models, and 21 translational pilot grant awards. A new five-year Strategic Plan 
was developed at a retreat attended by nearly all Center members in late November 2018, which established 
future scientific direction for the Programs and target areas for the recruitment. The new Strategic Plan is a 
shared-governance document that combines bottom-up input from the Center faculty with elements of top-down 
planning by the Director and CCLT, and is in concordance with the Institute's 10-year vision of building on existing 
strengths in research discovery (new targets) and early small molecule lead discovery (therapeutics). The CCLT 
holds monthly meetings at which among other activities, it evaluates the Center's progress in achieving goals 
established by the 5-year Strategic Plan, and in other areas including education, team science, and minority 
representation. Future growth areas identified by the new Strategic Plan are for 13 recruitments in the next grant 
period in chemical biology, structural biology, bioinformatics and immunology/vaccinology, while needed 
resources identified were improved access to animal models, new immunology targets and the need to adapt 
more rapidly to developing technologies. Progress toward providing for these needs has already begun. Several 
recruitments are underway or planned for the coming year, in many cases as joint recruitments by two or more 
Programs. A single cell sequencing technology initiative led by the Cancer Center to serve all three San Diego 
NCI cancer centers is well established."
10925312,"Project Summary
The Administrative Core will assist in all the aspects of administration, communication, and overall
conduct of the partnership between the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (MSSM) and
Hampton University (HU). It will act to promote the integration between the two Institutions,
organize meetings of the faculty and Advisory Committees, and facilitate participation in the
cancer education training program. The Administrative Core will provide support for personnel
involved in the administration, scientific oversight and coordination, communication, budgetary
oversight, and clerical functions associated with the overall research program proposed in this
partnership grant application.
The Core will facilitate and foster communication, coordination, and collaboration between HU
and MSSM in genetics and genomics training and education, both at the site and long distance.
It will also contribute to engage faculty members in cutting edge genetics and genomics
translational cancer research, with the overarching goal to build the bases for a sustainable
Center for Genetics and Genomics Cancer Research at HU.
The Core will be responsible for the coordination of the Program. Although the investigators have
previously developed long-lasting established collaborative interactions, achieving the integration
needed for a successful and sustained collaboration in genetics and genomics research, with
federally funded grant support will require a higher level of communication and interaction among
the PIs, trainees and staff, as well as the two partners Institutions as a whole.
The approach to coordination will include electronic communication (video conferencing and a
web-based content management system for document sharing, messaging, and calendaring) as
well as in person meetings. These will include meetings of the project investigators and their team,
meetings of the Leadership and Internal Advisory Committees, as well as distance learning for
the education segment of the program."
10925318,"PROJECT SUMMARY: TRAINING AND EDUCATION PROGRAM
 While minority faculty in the clinical and translational sector may provide an innovative perspective from
which we identify problems disproportionately plaguing populations of color, they often lack the research
capacity needed to both rigorously evaluate the causal predictors of these problems and identify mechanistic
modes of intervention for the elimination of health disparities. Moreover, minority investigators encounter major
barriers to successful competition for federal research funding, which include but are not limited to: inadequate
research training, a lack of opportunities for professional development, insufficient mentorship, and inadequate
support for research focused on minority populations (Shavers, 2005).
 Thus, in response to PAR-18-911, our goal is to partner with Hampton University (HU) faculty in order
to provide hybrid training and education to increase HU research capacity in the area of cancer genomics and
health disparities, while also providing a rigorous curriculum in introductory and advanced biostatistics and
data science, clinical genome science, epidemiology, community-engaged research, health disparities
research, and clinical research methods. The curriculum will be administered through online asynchronous and
synchronous lectures coupled with intensive on-site training sessions in Years 2 through 4 of the proposed
four-year partnership. Our objectives are to: 1) successfully implement the online cancer genomics research
training and education program; 2) design and successfully implement the on-site research training education
program; and 3) conduct a rigorous evaluation of the impact of the proposed training and education program
on building research capacity and increasing research engagement and productivity. Additionally, HU will be
providing extensive insight and guidance to help foster a culture of inclusion, diversity, and equity among
members of the ISMMS research workforce through a series of in-person and virtual lectures.
 In summary, we are confident that our proposed, comprehensive, online and on-site training and
education program will increase the competitive success of federal grant submissions by HU faculty for cancer
health disparities genomics research projects, while also providing them with an optimal skill-set that they can
disseminate to the larger HU community of faculty and students."

postdoctoral scholars with outstanding research and teaching experiences while improving the
recruitment of underrepresented groups into the fields of biomedical and behavioral research.
 The MERIT Program is facilitated through a partnership of the University of Alabama at
Birmingham, Oakwood University, Lawson State Community College, and the University of
Montevallo; all schools are located in Alabama within a 100 mile radius. During the current
funding period, assessment of the MERIT Program has indicated i) MERIT scholars have
progressed in their research productivity, teaching abilities, and faculty placement opportunities;
ii) increased programmatic impact on the Partner Institutions via the MERIT Research Seminar
Series, science-related curricula development, and summer research experiences; and iii)
productive collaborations with Partners as evidenced by receipt of federal grant awards.
 In this third competitive renewal, the research component continues to incorporate
laboratory-based instruction together with research ethics training and professional skills
development, including instruction in grant writing and time and laboratory management. The
teaching component remains comprised of four key elements: i) teaching-related coursework; ii)
one-on-one mentoring of an undergraduate student; iii) course development; and iv) class-room
and on-line teaching experiences. New programmatic elements for the next funding cycle
include enhanced recruitment approaches and academic job preparation; newly developed
formal mentor training; increased resources for current MERIT Scholars and Alumni; new and
expanded faculty collaborations at Oakwood, Lawson State and Montevallo through launch of a
shared teaching-as-research project; and increased UAB institutional commitment. Currently,
the MERIT Program funds nine training slots each year; in this application, we request to retain
this same number of training slots per year."
10893535,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The malaria parasite is one of the most deadly eukaryotic pathogens and more than 40% of the world's population
is at risk of contracting malaria. Due to growing resistance to currently available medications, there is a pressing
medical need for new drugs to prevent and treat malaria infection. This grant application focuses on the
optimization of two novel antimalarials (2a and (R)-3a) to target multiple life stages of the parasite that emerged
from our previous work on the Malaria Box compound MMV008138 that targets the apicoplast. These
compounds were identified using a combination of atomic property field-based virtual ligand screening (VLS) of
a library of 5 million publicly available compounds and synthetic chemistry campaigns. Although 2a and (R)-3a
bear a structural resemblance to MMV008138 and kill asexual blood-stages, their mechanism of action is
independent of the apicoplast. In addition, whereas MMV008138 only affects asexual blood-stages, 2a also kills
Stage V gametocytes, and (R)-3a weakly kills Plasmodium berghei liver-stages. For each of the two novel
compound series, we will explore: i) structure activity relationships that control potency, cellular selectivity, and
efficacy; ii) structure property relationships that govern adsorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion; and
iii) their potential mechanisms of action and resistance. The overarching goal of this project is to prioritize
preclinical leads having novel mechanism of action, high selectivity for Plasmodium versus the human host, and
physiochemical properties that are compatible with development of an orally available drug candidate. The two
principal goals of this R01 proposal are to: 1) structurally modify 2a (lead) and (R)-3a (hit) to optimize in vitro
asexual blood-stage potencies in addition to gametocicydal and/or liver stage activities, drug-like properties, and
pharmacokinetics, achieving in vivo P. berghei-infected mice efficacy with a single oral dose ED90 ≤ 10 mg/kg
for the 2a analogs (late lead) and an ED90 ≤ 40 mg/kg/day with 1-3 oral doses for the (R)-3a series (early lead),
and 2) identify the antimalarial mechanisms of action and resistance of 2a and (R)-3a (or their more potent
analogs) by chemoproteomic and resistance-selection approaches, respectively. The ancillary goal of this
proposal is to develop structure-activity relationships (SAR) for the P. falciparum gametocytocidal potency and
P. berghei liver-stage potency of these two series, and to determine consensus pharmacophores for multi-stage
activities (asexual blood-stage potencies plus gametocytocidal and/or liver-stage potencies). Efficacious
compounds identified in this way will thus be well-positioned for further preclinical development."

10867335,"Overweight and obesity are highly prevalent in the U.S. and are associated with increased breast cancer risk,
reduced treatment efficacy, and increased risk of recurrence, medical comorbidity and mortality. Breast cancer
survivorship is increasing, and is associated with weight gain, increased fat mass, insomnia, and disease risk,
making breast cancer survivorship a major healthcare priority. Weight loss is a standard treatment guideline for
individuals with breast cancer with overweight/obesity; however, achieving clinically significant and sustained
weight loss is challenging in general, and particularly for those who have undergone breast cancer treatment.
While several trials have tested the effects of behavioral weight loss (BWL) in breast cancer survivors, a
significant percentage of patients do not achieve clinically significant weight loss. Insomnia disorder is also highly
prevalent in individuals with breast cancer and, like obesity, predicts breast cancer risk, progression and death.
Research demonstrates that inadequate sleep may directly contribute to obesity and impair weight loss efforts
via many behavioral and biological pathways. Several studies demonstrate that cognitive-behavioral therapy for
insomnia (CBT-I) is efficacious in treating breast cancer survivors. One approach that has yet to be tested in a
large scale study, however, is adding an intervention to improve sleep quality before a BWL intervention. Our
preliminary data suggest that CBT-I may enhance weight loss outcomes in women with early stage breast cancer
(ESBC). Although the complex, inter-related mechanisms linking sleep, obesity and dietary/physical activity
behaviors are only beginning to be explored, we hypothesize that improving insomnia will catalyze weight loss
efforts and enhance the effects of BWL on dietary and physical activity behaviors. We propose a randomized
controlled clinical trial to test whether a 6-session CBT-I intervention delivered over 8-weeks combined with a
one-year BWL intervention (CBT-I+BWL) delivered via telehealth (audio-video) is superior to a sleep education
control condition (EDU) combined with BWL (EDU+BWL) among 250 adult female survivors of ESBC who are
overweight or obese and have insomnia. Assessments will be conducted at randomization, after CBT-I/EDU,
and at 3-, 6-, and 12-months of BWL. We have the following aims: Aim 1: Evaluate the short (3 mo), intermediate
(6 mo), and long-term (12-mo) effects of CBT-I+BWL compared to EDU+BWL on weight loss (% TWL 12-months,
primary) and body composition (secondary). Aim 2: Evaluate the extent to which 12-month weight loss is
mediated by pre to post sleep treatment changes in sleep parameters (Sleep Efficiency, SE; Total Sleep Time,
TST). Exploratory Aim 3: Determine whether CBT-I+BWL alters caloric intake, diet quality and/or physical activity
relative to EDU+BWL and evaluate the extent to which these factors are associated with sleep continuity and
weight loss at 3, 6 and 12-months. This novel approach to addressing sleep disturbances in weight loss treatment
has the potential to substantially impact the treatment of obesity and to advance the management of survivors
of ESBC."

 The study of mammalian immune cells and their interactions with tissue in situ is critical for understanding
how they regulate processes ranging from wound healing to autoimmune disease initiation to cancer and for
designing better therapeutic strategies to treat these prevalent conditions. Intravital multiphoton microscopy
(MPM) combined with a rich repertoire of fluorescent reporter mouse models and in vivo cell and tissue labeling
techniques have made it possible to visualize immune cell-tissue interactions at a subcellular level in skin and
other organs. However, there are significant differences in the structure and immune milieu of human skin that
limits the translatability of these findings to the human cutaneous immune response. Our group has recently
developed a fast large area multiphoton exoscope (FLAME), a unique imaging platform optimized for efficient
clinical skin imaging to rapidly generate macroscopic images (mm to cm-scale) with microscopic resolution (0.5-
1µm) based on label-free molecular contrast (fluorescence intensity and lifetime). In this application, we leverage
our extensive experience in MPM technology development and clinical imaging of more than 400 patients over
the past several years to develop the first MPM-based clinical device (iFLAME) as a research imaging tool
optimized for, and dedicated to, in vivo label-free imaging of immune cell populations and their dynamics in
human skin. In Aim 1, we develop iFLAME as a clinical research tool for efficient in vivo label-free imaging of
dermal cell populations and their dynamics in human skin. This work involves development of detection and
analytic approaches as well as optical and computational methods to enable rapid fluorescence lifetime detection
and analysis necessary to automate measurements of the cellular morphological and metabolic signatures. In
Aim 2, we validate iFLAME performance by demonstrating in vivo characterization of immune cells in normal
and inflamed human skin. In Aim 3, we develop quantitative morphological and metabolic MPM imaging
endpoints to assess immune infiltrates and their dynamics in human skin in the context of monitoring wound
healing. This work represents the first attempt to use intrinsic sources of MPM contrast to image, identify, and
quantify key immune cells in human skin in vivo based on their optical signatures and migratory behavior. Our
long-term goal is to develop iFLAME as a clinical research tool for rapid, label-free imaging of immune cells in
skin based on cellular morphologic and metabolic imaging endpoints. These can be used to better understand,
evaluate and optimize wound healing, autoimmune skin diseases and therapeutic responses."
10778627,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystemic autoimmune disease characterized by sustained
interferon (IFN) signaling and high titer autoantibodies leading to immune-mediated tissue damage. An abnormal
accumulation of nucleic acids derived from retrotransposons, a class of transposable element, has been linked
to diseases characterized by sustained IFN-I production, such as SLE. In particular, retrotransposons of the non-
LTR LINE1 (L1) family have been shown to be activated in patients with SLE. More recently, it was found that
the RNA-binding protein (ORF1p) and the ORF2p endonuclease/reverse transcriptase encoded by L1s are SLE
autoantigens, supporting the notion that L1 elements may play a role in SLE pathogenesis. This proposal is
focused on the study of a recently discovered antisense open reading frame (ORF) found in the L1 5’UTR,
termed ORF0. ORF0 encodes for a small nuclear protein (ORF0p) of 71 amino acid residues, which increases
L1 mobility. ORF0 has several unique features, which may have critical implications on the potential mechanistic
role of L1s in SLE pathogenesis. First, the number of ORF0 loci capable of encoding full-length ORF0p (~781
loci) is ~8-10 times higher than ORF1 and ORF2 (~80–100 active copies). Thus, in the setting of L1 activation,
such as in SLE, it is expected that the antigenic load of ORF0p would be more robust than ORF1p and ORF2p.
Second, ORF0 has two prominent splice donor sites that act in concert with splice acceptors in downstream
genomic sequences, generating ORF0p-fusion proteins. This is, the N-terminus of the “host” protein would be
replaced by the ORF0p N-terminal sequence, producing hybrid proteins. Based on this premise, our central
hypothesis is that L1 activation in SLE leads to ORF0 dysregulation, which drives the production of anti-ORF0p
antibodies and an abnormal expression of hybrid ORF0p-fusion proteins, generating neoantigens targeted in
SLE. Indeed, our preliminary studies demonstrate that ORF0p is an autoantigen in SLE. The major goal of this
exploratory/developmental research grant is to investigate the clinical significance of anti-ORF0p antibodies in
SLE and to address the hypothesis that patients with SLE have an abnormal production of ORF0p-host fusion
proteins containing lupus autoantigens."
10833207,"Project Summary:
 The overarching goal of the proposed research is to understand the mechanism of hair
follicle stem cell (HF-SC) maintenance and aging. HF-SCs reside in an anatomically distinct
region, called the bulge. During the lifespan, HF-SCs go through a multi-stage process, called
the hair cycle, to generate hair shaft and self-renew. During the anagen phase of hair cycle, HF-
SCs and their hair germ progenitors give rise to a large number of transit-amplifying cells in the
Matrix of hair bulb, where precursors to terminally differentiated hair shaft are produced, to fuel
hair growth. During the catagen phase, most cells in the lower portion of hair follicles, including
the Matrix, undergo apoptosis but a few cells survive and move upward to help to form the new
bulge compartment. Upon the formation of the new bulge compartment, HF-SCs usually rest in
the quiescent telogen phase before initiating the next anagen hair growth. Although many
studies have examined mechanisms that regulate self-renewal and differentiation of HF-SCs, it
remains poorly understood how these stem cells quantitatively control hair growth and how their
functions decline during aging. In the first funding cycle, we have established skin specific,
Foxc1 and Nfatc1 double knockout as a premature aging model for HFs and revealed the
escape of HF-SCs from their bulge niche as a new mechanism for the reduction of HF-SCs and
HF miniaturization. In our preliminary study, we have generated a hair cycle stage-specific
single-cell atlas and a longitudinal single-cell atlas during aging. These rich single-cell
transcriptomic datasets have identified a unique cell population of migratory niche (migNiche).
Using intravital live imaging to track the duration of hair growth for individual HFs across multiple
hair cycles in our mutant model, we have obtained experimental evidence that the size of HF-
SC bulge controls the duration of anagen hair growth and the size of HFs and, in turn, define the
size of the next-generation bulge. In this proposal, we will utilize our innovative intravital
imaging, single-cell genomic tools and genetically engineered mouse models to understand cell
extrinsic and cell intrinsic mechanisms of hair follicle stem cell maintenance. We will Investigate
the formation of new HF-SC compartment and its effect on hair growth (Aim 1). We will then
elucidate FOXC1/NFATC1-mediated gene expression control in the migratory niche (Aim 2).
Finally, we will elucidate the mechanism and consequence of HF-SC escape (Aim 3). Together,
our renewal application will provide conceptual and mechanistic insights into the maintenance of
HF-SCs through a cell extrinsic mechanism mediated by migNiche and a cell intrinsic
mechanism controlled by HF-SC adhesion."

Critical to the evaluation of potential therapeutics (pharmacological, gene, or cell therapies) are sensitive and
repeatable physiological assessments of muscle function applied to mouse models of dystrophy. Therefore,
we are proposing to continue a research core that performs ex vivo, in situ, and whole animal assessments
of muscle integrity and function. This core will not only support the needs of the projects within the center, but
will also serve as a national resource for performing functional evaluation of potential therapies for the
muscular dystrophies. The Physiological Assessment Core resources are housed in the laboratory space
designated to Dr. Barton, the Core Director. Dr. Barton is a muscle physiologist with extensive experience
evaluating muscle function in mice. This includes all instrumentation for muscle physiological measurements,
specialized equipment for hindlimb suspension experiments, documented free wheel running, and treadmill
running, as well as interim storage of samples in both –80C and liquid nitrogen freezers. We propose to
collaborate with neighboring colleagues to assess whole animal respiratory function, which will complement
ex vivo assessment of the diaphragm.
We believe that this Core has provided a previously unmet need in the past 15 years of its existence, and will
continue to be a valuable resource that will enable the entire muscular dystrophy research community to
utilize these assays to assess the potential benefits of a large number of approaches to the treatment of
different forms of muscular dystrophy."
10888340,"Abstract
The multifaceted pathologies associated with muscular dystrophies, particularly Duchenne muscular dystrophy
(DMD), represent major challenges to the development and clinical implementation of effective therapeutics for
these diseases. AAV gene therapy, delivering a µdystrophin construct to all striated muscles, is now poised to
bring about transformative alterations in DMD disease course. However, a number of significant hurdles
remain before it can be successfully applied to all DMD patients. There is a need to prevent and resolve
fibrosis in order to improve the efficiency of delivery and enable the use of lower viral doses. Additional
therapeutics may be needed to slow the skeletal muscle disease progression that remains after µdystrophin
therapy. Perhaps the most critical issue facing AAV gene therapy for DMD is that current µdystrophin designs
and vector doses are optimized for skeletal muscle without sufficient evaluation of the potential impact on
cardiac muscle function. The aims of this project are motivated by our observations in the D2.mdx model of
DMD: (1) µdystrophin overexpression is highly beneficial for skeletal muscle, but it does not completely prevent
progressive fibrosis, especially in the diaphragm; (2) AAV delivery is markedly less efficient in highly fibrotic
muscle; (3) µdystrophin fails to rescue the heart; and (4) countermeasures can compensate for deficiencies of
the µdystrophins, and may form the basis of combination therapies for DMD.

Project 2 of this Wellstone Center has been studying modifiers of muscular dystrophy and its associated
cardiomyopathy. Through the first funding period of this Wellstone Center (2010-2015), we evaluated latent
TGF-b binding protein 4 (LTBP4) as a modifier of muscular dystrophy, discovering human genetic variation that
correlated with prolonged ambulation in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). The Ltbp4 modifier data from
mice demonstrated that LTBP4’s hinge is critical for stabilizing latent TGFb and myostatin and preventing their
release and activity. From this work, we are advancing anti-LTBP4 antibodies as a potential biological agent to
treat DMD. We identified a second modifier, Anxa6, encoding annexin A6. Using high resolution, real-time
microscopy we found that annexin A6 functions as a mediator of membrane repair. We also uncovered a
critical interaction between glucocorticoid steroids and annexin A6, demonstrating that intermittent low-dose
glucocorticoid steroids promote membrane resealing, in part, by upregulating annexin A6. Glucocorticoid
steroids are a pharmacologic modifier of DMD, but their mechanisms of action in DMD are incompletely
understood. In mouse models of muscular dystrophy, we found that intermittent low dose steroids enhanced
muscle repair and muscle performance without the same adverse side effects elicited from daily steroids.
Furthermore, we found that intermittent steroid use improved strength and function in several mouse models of
Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy, prompting a pilot clinical trial in patients with muscular dystrophy types not
normally treated with steroids. We will now focus on defining how steroid use alters muscle inflammatory cells
and how this is reflected in serum and cytokine profiles. These studies are specifically designed to translate
into the human setting. We will also explore a novel compound that leads to CaMK activation, a key feature
seen after intermittent steroid use. We plan to test models for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy as well as Limb
Girdle Muscular Dystrophy. In the last aim, we will test a putative new modifier for the heart in muscular
dystrophy, as this modifier is expected to promote similar metabolic shifts seen in muscle after intermittent
steroid use. Overall, these experiments are designed to identify dosing strategies, pharmacodynamic
biomarkers, and novel treatments that can be used in muscular dystrophy patients on their own or as adjuncts
to gene therapy. The outcomes from these experiments will be used in translating these findings to patients
with multiple forms of muscular dystrophy. This Project is conducted jointly with investigators from
Northwestern and UCLA with collaboration from investigators and core facilities at the University of Florida."

Project 3 serves as the translational project for this Center application, complementing preclinical
therapeutic development in Projects 1 & 2. Building on our expertise in noninvasive magnetic
resonance (MR) biomarker development, we will examine metabolic remodeling in patients with
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) treated with emerging therapies and the most common
form of limb girdle muscular dystrophy, LGMDR1 (also referred to as LGMD2A). Effective clinical
management in both forms of muscular dystrophy will likely require multiple concomitant
treatment strategies, which can have positive or negative metabolic consequences.
Our central hypothesis is that disease progression in dystrophic muscle is associated with
metabolic remodeling, which can be modulated by different pharmacologic strategies and
exploited to provide novel biomarkers for therapeutic development. Obesity and an increase in
metabolic risk factors have been recognized as hallmark features of DMD, exacerbated by
chronic use of glucocorticoid steroids (GC). Micro-dystrophin (µDys) gene therapy has emerged
as a promising treatment strategy, with significant restoration of dystrophin protein and
favorable clinical data in early stage clinical trials. However, due to the truncated nature of the
µDys protein, impaired nNOS localization and/or aberrant calcium handling are expected to
persist post gene therapy (Focus of Project 1). In addition, immune response management
requires concomitant chronic use of GC. To gain further insight into the effects of µDys gene
therapy in individuals with DMD, Aim 1 will examine MR biomarkers of muscle metabolism,
inflammation, and composition in DMD patients treated with AAV-µDys. The disease course will
be characterized in multiple muscles and compared with the disease trajectory in untreated, age
matched DMD (historical data) and Becker muscular dystrophy patients; the latter patients are
expected to mirror the phenotypic profile post-gene therapy. In Aim 2, we will leverage
extensive natural history data/biosamples and access to ongoing clinical studies to examine the
effect of different GC dosing regimens (Synergy with Project 2) and chronic GC exposure on
both muscle and whole-body metabolism in DMD. Finally, in Aim 3, we will extend our
biomarker work to LGMDR1, an underserved patient population in therapeutic development. We
will use a combination of MR biomarkers and metabolomics to characterize the natural history of
disease progression and help identify therapeutic targets and novel biomarkers for future clinical
trials."
10897254,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Cardiac contractility is regulated by Ca2+ release form the sarcoplasmic reticulum through ryanodine receptor
(RyR2), a protein with multiple regulatory domains for Ca2+, Mg2+, protein kinase, caffeine and FKBP12.6. Since
a number of RyR2 missense mutations associate with lethal cardiomyopathies, a detailed understanding of
regulatory mechanisms of RyR2 is essential for treatment of these pathologies. Two strategies of heterologous
expression of recombinant RyR2 mutants in HEK293 cells and transgenic mouse models, have been used to
study structure/function relationship of RyR2 and the functional consequences of disease-linked RyR2 mutations.
Although these approaches have provided new insights into RyR2 regulatory mechanisms, they have inherent
drawbacks of cells with non-cardiac genetic background and differences in human and mice hearts. We have
therefore established an alternate research platform where RyR2 mutations are introduced in human induced
pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs)-derived cardiomyocytes (CMs) using CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing. Mutant
myocytes are then cultured in media that matures them structurally and functionally toward adult cardiomyocyte
state. Using this human myocyte platform, we propose to examine molecular mechanisms underlying Ca2+,
caffeine, and FKBP regulation of RyR2 associated with CPVT1 pathology. Specifically we aim: 1) To compare
Ca2+-signaling consequences of domain specific CPVT1-associated RyR2 mutations expressed in
“mature” hiPSC-CMs , rescue their phenotype by back-mutagenesis, and determine their drug
specificity; 2) To characterize the functional consequence of mutating the RyR2 Ca2+ and caffeine
binding sites, predicted from near atomic structure and determine their interaction; and 3) To
characterize mechanisms underlying loss-of-function CPVT1-associated RyR2 mutations and identify
the difference between Ca2+ leaky and non-leaky mutations. To accomplish these aims we propose to create
multiple mutant lines of our more mature hiPSC-CMs carrying the different RyR2 mutations and examine their
Ca2+ signaling aberrancies. Membrane currents and intracellular Ca2+ signals of wild type and mutant hiPSC-
derived cardiomyocytes will be quantified in patch-clamped myocytes imaged by confocal/TIRF microscopy
using genetically encoded Ca2+ probes targeted to various nodes of Ca2+ signaling pathway. We will also use
[3H]ryanodine binding assay, to determine possible alterations in affinities of Ca2+, caffeine and accessory
proteins. To assure the reliability of our hiPSC-platform, we will compare the Ca2+ signaling aberrancies of
mutagenesis in hiPSC-CMs with in vivo knock-in of RyR2 mutations in mouse models. We hope that our novel
approach will make it possible to systematically characterize the phenotype of the CPVT1 mutants, as well as
non-CPVT1 mutants with implication to atomic structure of RyR2, in human myocardium, thus providing a novel
and synergistic human platform for studies of RyR2 regulation."
10908517,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Secreted serine proteases are abundant in the intact CNS and become deregulated by injury and disease, yet
we lack knowledge regarding their physiological functions and contributions to pathology. Several years ago, the
discovery of a set of enzyme-activated G protein-coupled receptors, the Protease Activated Receptors (PARs),
led to a new conceptual framework for understanding the physiological impact of proteases. PARs permit
activating enzymes to signal in a hormone-like fashion to modulate key cellular functions, but when overactivated
can contribute to pathology. The PI’s team recently discovered that mice with global PAR1 gene knockout exhibit
significant improvements in locomotor recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI). Functional improvements were
accompanied by reductions in inflammation and astrogliosis and improvements in the appearance of myelin and
axons, all integral substrates to support restoration of function. We also documented that CNS injury relevant
proteases, such as thrombin and kallikrein 6 elicit Ca2+, MAPK and STAT3 signaling linked to neuroinflammation
and pro-injury responses across neurons and neuroglia in a PAR1-dependent manner. Together, these studies
highlight the likely multifactorial roles played by PAR1 in key cellular and molecular events positioned to govern
outcomes after SCI. These findings also highlight the potential to target PAR1 for neural protection and repair.
Despite these encouraging findings the cellular mechanisms by which blocking PAR1 improves recovery after
SCI have not been defined and this knowledge gap hampers progress towards translation of existing FDA
approved and orally bioavailable PAR1 small molecule inhibitors. Additionally, whether blocking PAR1
therapeutically at acute or chronic time points after SCI are both capable of improving neural recovery is
unknown. Based on recently published findings, taken with new preliminary results, we propose 3 integrated
Aims to test the Central Hypothesis that PAR1 is an essential regulator of reactivity across the microglial-
astrocyte compartments and can be selectively blocked to improve glial-neuronal trophic coupling,
neuroprotection and repair after SCI. In Aim 1, we will determine the impact of pharmacologic PAR1 inhibition
initiated at acute or chronic time points after injury on signs of neuroprotection, neural repair and recovery of
sensorimotor function and use ribosomal mRNA capture techniques to document cellular and molecular
mechanisms engaged across the astroglial, microglial/monocyte and neuron compartments. In Aim 2, we will
determine whether conditional deletion of PAR1 selectively in astrocytes, microglia or peripheral monocytes is
sufficient to enhance recovery. In Aim 3, we will use glial-neuron co-cultures as bioassays to establish PAR1-
regulated glial-neural trophic coupling mechanisms relevant to neuroprotection and repair. The studies proposed
address key mechanistic questions regarding the functional roles of PAR1 in neural injury and will provide new
information needed to optimize therapeutic targeting strategies for recovery of function."
10912628,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
The overall goals of the Route 66 Endometrial Cancer SPORE Developmental Research Program (DRP) are
to support innovative, early-stage research in endometrial cancer, to develop pilot projects to the point of
inclusion as full SPORE projects, to increase the number of investigators committed to endometrial cancer,
and to diversify the workforce. This last goal is important because less than 3% of oncologists and less than
4% of academic obstetricians and gynecologist identify as Black. Moreover, although over 80% of those
working in obstetrics and gynecology are women, fewer than 30% of tenured faculty members in Departments
of Obstetrics and Gynecology are women. To achieve these goals, the Route 66 Endometrial Cancer SPORE
DRP will provide one- to two-year pilot funding for projects in basic, translational, clinical, epidemiologic, and
cancer prevention and control research. The DRP will be open to all three participating institutions in the
SPORE (Washington University in St. Louis, University of New Mexico, and University of Oklahoma). We will
encourage investigators to submit collaborative proposals with investigators from other SPOREs. We will use
both NCI and institutional funding to support up to three DRP projects each year throughout the life of the
SPORE. Requests for applications for DRP projects in endometrial cancer research will be released once per
year. All applications will be reviewed by a Grant Review Committee consisting of scientists (representing
basic and applied science) with expertise in endometrial or related cancers or relevant science, a
biostatistician, a patient advocate, and ad hoc members, as necessary. Once a DRP project is funded, we will
provide dedicated support to ensure success of the project, evaluate progress regularly, assess outcomes, and
decide whether DRP projects should be recommended for funding as a full SPORE project in this or a future
funding cycle. As a result of the DRP, bold new ideas in endometrial cancer research will be funded at the pilot
stage and developed to lead to new treatment or prevention strategies. We fully anticipate that one or more
DRP projects will be elevated to full SPORE projects in the next funding period. Additionally, new investigators
will leverage DRP support to develop their projects, obtain preliminary data, and secure external funding and
thus establish their careers in endometrial cancer research. Finally, established investigators who are new to
the field will apply their knowledge and expertise to the field of endometrial cancer."
11070284,"Humoral immunization to alloantigens on red blood cells (RBC alloimmunization) remains a major complication,
and in some cases barrier to transfusion therapy for myriad diseases. However, the tendency to become
alloimmunized is not evenly distributed; rather, patients tend to become alloimmunized to multiple alloantigens
(responders) or none at all despite chronic transfusion (nonresponders). However, the factors that regulate
responder vs. nonresponder status remain poorly defined. Rates of RBC alloimmunization is increased in
patients with autoimmune pathologies, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We have recently
discovered that mice with SLE-like biology (i.e. develop anti-nuclear antibodies (ANAs)) have an increased rate
of RBC alloimmunization. These mice develop ANAs due to a specific cluster of variant genes (NBA2) that
contains multiple orthologues to human genes associated with SLE. Importantly, the NBA2 mice do not display
organ pathology associated with SLE, leading to the hypothesis that ANA are an isolated component of SLE that
affects RBC alloimmunization. Moreover, in NBA2 mice, toll like receptor 7 (TLR7) and TLR9 are known to
regulate ANA formation through mutual antagonism (TLR7 promotes and TLR9 suppresses). These findings
lead to the central hypothesis of this project: Central Hypothesis: Anti-nuclear antibodies cause increased RBC
alloimmunization through activation of B cells as a result of dysregulated TLR7 and TLR9 signaling. This
hypothesis is tested using a novel B cell receptor transgenic mouse that recognizes an authentic human blood
group antigen (Kpb epitope) on the human KEL glycoprotein. The anti-Kpb mouse is combined with NBA2 mice
that are then transfused with transgenic RBCs expressing the KEL-K2 variant of human KEL, which contains the
Kpb antigen. This approach allows an in vivo mechanistic study of early activation and differentiation of naïve B
cells specific for an RBC antigen on transfused RBCs. Specific aims 1 and 2 test the role of ANAs on RBC
alloimmunization, including the manipulation of TLR7 and TLR9 signaling to rigorously test the central
hypothesis. Specific aim 3 uses the human cohort of SCD patients studied in project 4. Patients with SCD
have high rates of ANAs. The presence or absence of ANAs in patient plasma will be correlated with patterns
of alloimmunization. Patient leukocytes will be stimulated in vitro, in the presence or absence of ANA containing
plasma and/or TLR7 and TLR9 agonism or antagonism, using an assay that measures B cell activation and
differentiation in response to CD4+ follicular T cell help. Synergy between projects comes from crosstalk between
purinergic signaling (project 2) and TLR7 and TLR9, that reticulocytes (project 3) provide agonists for TLR7 and
TLR9, and the prediction that genetic variations known to predispose humans to ANA formation will emerge as
associations in the prospective GWAS study on RBC alloimmunization in patients with SCD (project 4). The
proposed studies have the capacity to both identify novel predictors of RBC alloimmunization (i.e. ANAs) and to
provide novel mechanistic insight that can serve as the basis for development of new therapeutics."
10888979,"Project Summary
Immunological memory is a defining characteristic of vertebrate immune systems, and is encoded in part by populations of T lymphocytes that respond rapidly and potently to repeat exposures to pathogens. These populations are remarkably diverse in their phenotypes and trafficking patterns, and collectively form an ecosystem that reflects a lifetime's exposure to pathogens and to our environment. Yet a fundamental and pressing problem remains - we have a very limited quantitative grasp of how immunological memory is established and maintained, how new memories to infections are integrated with existing memories, and how and why these wane over time. A detailed understanding of these phenomena would guide the design of vaccines that induce durable immunity, and the development of therapies to revive and sustain T cell responses in the settings of chronic infections and cancer.
The memory encoded by circulating T cells is highly dynamic. It is sculpted by self-renewal, differentiation, loss, and supplementation or competition with newly-recruited cells. Further, in both mice and humans, memory induced by pathogens co-exists with abundant 'natural' memory T cells, which are specific for commensal and environmental antigens but provide cross-protection to new infections; and with regulatory T cells, that limit inappropriate responses. We have very little understanding of how these three populations relate.
In this project we will integrate together a powerful set of modeling and experimental approaches to confront these uncertainties. Specifically, we will develop a structured population modeling (PDE) approach to use with a fate-mapping system that tracks T cell populations throughout their life-histories. We will then combine the fate mapping system with a DNA labeling method and ODE models to define memory T cell dynamics in detail. Together, these approaches will map the development, structure, and rules of replacement of circulating memory T cell subsets in mice. We will also use data from a novel division-reporter mouse strain to model the emergence and long-term dynamics ofT cell memory to influenza infection. Finally, we will combine modeling with fate-mapping and division-reporter mice to understand how regulatory T cells are maintained, and how they impact both natural and influenza-specific memory populations."
10897959,"DNA sensing by the cGAS-STING pathway is essential for recognizing pathogens, tumor cells, and mitochondrial
or nuclear DNA under certain conditions, leading to homeostatic responses, such as immune control of
pathogens and cancer. Under some conditions, such as loss of the nuclease TREX1, excess DNA triggers cGAS-
STING and causes a chronic inflammation (e.g., Aicardi Goutierès Syndrome, or a constitutively active STING
allele, causes SAVI, an inherited vasculopathy). Upon activation by its ligand, cGAMP, STING translocates from
ER → Golgi → endosomes where it signals through TBK1 and IRF3 to activate interferons, and is then degraded
via lysosomes. These trafficking patterns are central to STING’s function, and yet we lack knowledge of many of
the genes regulating these processes. To identify regulators of STING activity, trafficking and degradation, we
performed two genome-wide CRISPR knockout screens, as well as a proximity-ligation mediated proteomic
analysis, and a focused CRISPR screen. Studying the dozens of factors found, we made two significant
discoveries that provide the basis for this proposal. First, we found that ESCRT-dependent endosomal
microautophagy requires recognition of ubiquitinated STING on endosomes, and is critical for STING
degradation, autophagosome sealing and signaling regulation. Disruption of this pathway by a pathogenic
ESCRT subunit mutant (found in a human disease) leads to constitutive STING signaling at steady state.
Second, we uncovered a novel interaction of ER-localized STING with endosomal protein DNAJC13, leading to
restriction of STING ER exit and activation. Loss of DNAJC13 or disruption of ER-endosome contact sites
dramatically boosts STING activity. Having defined a model of STING ubiquitination controlling autophagy
resolution, and DNAJC13 restricting STING ER exit, we propose to further our understanding of this pathway by
studying the mechanisms underlying these processes, including identifying E3 ubiquitin ligases that modify
STING and induce ESCRT-dependent autophagy, and determining the impact of STING-induced endosomal
microautophagy on viral infections. We will also determine how DNAJC13 blocks STING activity by altering
STING trafficking. We will test the roles of DNAJC13 and ER-endosomal contacts in limiting STING activation
by restricting STING ER exit to the TGN. To define the biochemical mechanisms of STING interactions, we will
use deep mutational scanning to find motifs on STING that are responsible for interactions with DNAJC13 and
for the effects of DNAJC13 on STING trafficking, as well as motifs that control other aspects of STING localization
and signaling. Finally, we will study how mutations in genes involved in human pathologies that regulate STING
trafficking, impact inflammation and death of cells of the central nervous system. A better understanding of
STING trafficking, degradation and signaling will help us develop therapeutic approaches to dampen
autoimmunity or boost pathogen and tumor immunity."
10891403,"Summary
Crohn’s disease and Ulcerative colitis collectively referred as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
are diseases in which an aberrant intestinal immune response leads to chronic inflammation. IBD
affects an estimated 1.5 million Americans, 2.2 million people in Europe and hundreds of
thousands in the rest of the world. The pathogenesis of IBD, while not completely elucidated, is
thought to be multifactorial and caused by the interplay of genetics, the microbiome and the
environment. One of the major environmental factors associated with increasing the risk for IBD
is the diet that an individual consumes. Therefore, the ability to harness nutrition to treat disease
is a unique opportunity for profound intervention in IBD progression. The major challenge for
implementing dietary therapy for IBD is the lack of understanding of detailed mechanistic
pathways to explain the impact of dietary interventions on IBD severity or progression.
Epidemiological studies of IBD have shown dietary fiber as the most consistent macronutrient
associated with changing risk of IBD. Fiber affects several aspects of the digestive process.
Notably, it is also a main energy source for several bacterial species of the microbiome, and
differences in fiber consumption strongly affect the microbiome composition and metabolic
behavior. However, very few studies have systematically addressed the role of fiber consumption
in fluctuations of the microbiome that lead to specific changes in the intestinal immune response.
The overall goal of this project is to discover relevant dietary fiber-microbe-immune cell
interactions that prevent, induce or alter the course of gut inflammation. We will analyze the
changes in microbiota composition and intestinal cell populations caused by the lack of
fermentable fiber intake using a model in which mice are fed a complex diet that contains
fermentable and non-fermentable fiber or semi-purified ingredients diet lacking fermentable fiber.
Moreover, we will select purified fibers representing different fiber types and supplement them in
the non-fermentable diet to identify those whose consumption modulate intestinal responses in a
healthy state and during inflammation. Finally, to assess the impact of consuming a diet lacking
fermentable fiber on the immune system in the context of human microbiota, we will colonize germ
free mice with healthy human donor fecal samples and feed them either a mixed fiber, a non-
fermentable fiber or a non-fermentable fiber diet supplemented with specific fibers to identify
specific fiber supplementations that result in the modulation of immune responses by human
microbiota, as well as the bacterial members mediating this interaction."

The clinical management of coronary artery disease (CAD) and the prevention of acute coronary syndromes
(ACS) require knowledge of the underlying atherosclerotic plaque pathobiology. Current intravascular
standalone imaging techniques are limited in their ability to evaluate processes that lead to plaque progression
and sudden changes in plaque structure (e.g. rupture or erosion) conducive to ACS in humans. Hybrid
intravascular imaging systems hold premises for a more comprehensive evaluation of plaque pathobiology in
patients and are urgently needed. Our goal is to address this need through the development of an intravascular
imaging approach capable of simultaneous assessment of changes in plaque biochemical composition and
morphology associated with critical pathobiological processes in patients. We propose to advance an
intravascular imaging system combining two complementary label-free optical techniques, specifically,
Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging (FLIm) and Polarization Sensitive Optical Coherent Tomography (PSOCT) via
an innovative bimodal imaging catheter suitable for percutaneous coronary imaging (PCI). This dual-modality
approach should 1) yield great insight into the interplay of biochemical-morphological features that have a key
role in plaque progression, destabilization and/or remodeling and 2) enable immediate display this information
in near real-time, in a visual format useful for guiding personalized management of coronary lesions at the time
of cardiac catheterization. The proposed technique will be able to perform safe and rapid co-registered
measurement of (1) time-resolved fluorescence decays in multiple spectral emission bands, and (2) polarization-
resolved optical tomographic data in a single pullback. To achieve our goal, we will first construct a FLIm-PSOCT
catheter system including a freeform reflective optic providing optimized optical performance for both FLIm and
PSOCT (Aim 1). Second, to demonstrate FLIm-PSOCT’s performance for fast and simultaneous/synergetic
assessment of critical biochemical features associated with distinct morphological features, we will use the
proposed hybrid system to image human coronary samples (ex vivo), with histopathology corroboration (Aim2).
Finally, we will deploy this system in patients (first-in-human) to evaluate plaques during cardiac catheterization
and determine clinical feasibility (Aim 3). The successful completion of this study will demonstrate the clinical
feasibility and utility of intracoronary FLIm-PSOCT for assessment of critical plaque features likely to cause ACS.
If such features can be reliably detected, the patients undergoing PCI procedures may benefit from personalized
treatment of these plaques and improved outcome."

 Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are pentameric ligand-gated ion channels responsible for excitatory
signaling throughout the nervous system. The α7 nicotinic receptor subtype is a widely expressed subtype that
is unique among nicotinic receptors in that it forms a functional homopentamer, desensitizes rapidly, and is
exceptionally permeable to Ca2+. It plays a prominent role in human disease with dysregulation of α7 linked to
Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia, and inflammation. α7’s unique characteristics and involvement in disease
have made it an attractive therapeutic target leading to the development of numerous compounds aimed at
enhancing α7 activity. Among the most promising strategies are positive allosteric modulators (PAMs). PAMs
increase receptor activity while maintaining the spatial and temporal characteristics of endogenous
neurotransmission. Despite strong functional characterization, precise modulator binding sites and structural
mechanisms of potentiation remain unknown, representing a major roadblock towards rational drug design.
Moreover, while α7 can uniquely assemble as a functional homopentamer, it can also associate with other
subtypes forming a heteromer, yielding increased diversity and altered channel properties. The degree of α7
channel diversity in native tissue is unclear. Thus, the major goal of this application is to resolve key questions
related to the α7 subtype by elucidating receptor modulation mechanisms and determining the molecular
structure of native α7. Building on previous work defining major gating cycle conformations, I aim to determine
high resolution structures of α7 complexed with numerous allosteric modulators. In parallel, I will develop a
method to purify native α7 from brain tissue and determine the structure of α7-containing channels using single
particle cryo-EM. Taken together, this work will define mechanisms of receptor modulation and native α7
structure and subunit stoichiometry, enhancing our understanding of α7 biology and pharmacology. Furthermore,
this work will provide a foundation for future native receptor purification and aid drug development towards the
entire nicotinic receptor family."

Mucopolysaccharidoses type I (MPS I) is a devastating lysosomal storage disorder that affects approximately 1
in 100,000 newborns. MPS I is characterized by mutations in the α-L-Iduronidase (IDUA) gene that lead to an
accumulation of glycosaminoglycans in lysosomes. While treatment is available, it is non-curative, monetarily
costly, and time-consuming. To this end, alternative therapies to MPS I have been highly sought after and one
such approach is gene therapy. While several vector systems have been explored in the pursuit of a gene therapy
treatment for MPS I, adenoviral vectors have been highly understudied. Adenoviral vectors offer several
advantages to other vectors such as the ability to transduce both replicating and non-replicating cells, the inability
to integrate into the host genome without the use of gene editing technology, and recent modifications leading
to the ability to transduce previously unreachable cell types. Thus, investigating the consequences of adenoviral
mediated gene therapy for MPS I could lead to new treatment avenues for MPS I. In order to understand the
consequence(s) of adenoviral gene therapy for MPS I, I will employ the MPS I murine model and develop an
adenoviral vector to deliver the open reading frame for IDUA. I plan to modify our vector using a myeloid-binding
peptide to favorably transduce endothelial cells. I hypothesize that a non-liver cellular source can subserve
the role of cellular production of IDUA and traverse liver targeting, and, through employment of gene
editing technology, long-term correction can be achieved. I will address this hypothesis and achieve the
goals of this proposal by employing a myeloid binding peptide modified adenoviral vector expressing IDUA and
using in vivo assays to determine IDUA levels in serum post-infection. I will also determine the ability to achieve
long-term correction through the use the gene editing technology CRISPR/Cas9. The findings of this proposal
will better determine the feasibility of utilizing modified adenoviral vectors as gene therapy vessels and as a
treatment method for MPS I and other inherited, monogenic disorders."
10886514,"A critical barrier to reducing S. aureus infections is identifying nonantibiotic methods to reliably prevent S. aureus
nasal colonization. There is no vaccine against S. aureus, and S. aureus is a major healthcare burden. A third
of adults have S. aureus nasal colonization, and this is a risk factor for developing serious infection at distant
body sites, with an individual’s nasal strain responsible for infection ~80% of the time. My goal is to address the
urgent need for new, nonantibiotic approaches to prevent S. aureus nasal colonization by identifying host factors
(mucins) and beneficial bacteria (Dolosigranulum pigrum) with the potential to prevent S. aureus nasal
colonization. High levels of D. pigrum are associated with lower levels of S. aureus nasal colonization in
microbiota composition studies, and D. pigrum inhibits S. aureus on agar medium. Using an innovative model
system, human nasal epithelial organoids (HNOs), I have successfully colonized HNOs with each bacterium for
48 hours at physiological nasal-passage temperature. My preliminary data shows that D. pigrum influences
epithelial expression of MUC2, a mucin associated with bacterial tolerance in the gut. HNOs produce a thick
mucus layer that is circulated by functional multiciliated cells. My overarching hypothesis is that D. pigrum alters
S. aureus colonization in the context of a mucus-covered nasal epithelium. Mucus is a key factor in mucosal
bacterial colonization; however, its impact on S. aureus nasal colonization is poorly understood. My objective is
to determine how each bacterium affects mucus production, how this in turn influences colonization, and whether
D. pigrum influences S. aureus colonization of HNOs. In Aim 1, I will define how D. pigrum and S. aureus affect
HNO mucin profiles by quantifying mucin protein expression during colonization. I will determine colonization
success by each bacterium when key differentially produced mucins are present vs. absent using the CRISPR-
Cas9 system to generate two homozygous mutant HNO lines, each lacking one specific mucin. In Aim 2, I will
determine how D. pigrum influences S. aureus colonization and fitness on HNOs. I will first characterize the
biogeography of each organism alone and together on HNOs. I will then define S. aureus colonization success
during mono- vs. cocolonization by 1) quantifying CFUs; 2) using RNAseq to compare its transcriptome; and 3)
using transposon mutant fitness profiling (Tn-seq) with an existing S. aureus Tn-library to identify genes
important for fitness on HNOs. I will use bacterial genetics to determine if 2 of these candidate S. aureus genes
are influenced by D. pigrum and/or greatly contribute to fitness on HNOs. The significance of this project is that
it addresses gaps in knowledge as to how nasal mucus production influences bacterial colonization and how S.
aureus responds to host and bacterial signals in a complex, mucus-covered epithelium. This F31 will train me to
investigate host-microbe and microbe-microbe interactions in the context of a new model of nasal respiratory
epithelium. It will prepare me to achieve my long-term goal of becoming a Principal Investigator working at the
intersection of microbe-microbe interactions, host-microbe interactions, and mucosal biology."
10691647,"VA has recognized that Agent Orange exposure is associated with development of bladder
cancer, chronic B-cell leukemia, Hodgkin’s and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, multiple myeloma,
prostate cancer, respiratory cancer, and a subset of soft tissue cancers including fibrosarcoma.
More recently, burn pit exposure has also been implicated in development of several cancers including
fibrosarcoma. Patients with advanced cases of fibrosarcoma have poor long-term survival because of
resistance that cancer cells develop to chemo, radiation, and biologic therapies. An effective solution is
to target multiple components in an essential cancer growth and metastasis pathway. Hypoxia Inducible
Factors (HIF) are transcription factors that are activated by hypoxia and other environmental stresses
present in solid tumors. The enzyme acyl-CoA synthetase short chain family member 2 (Acss2) also
responds to oxygen or glucose deprivation. Acss2 and HIF-2 are independent components of a
signaling axis that is usurped by cancer cells to promote tumor growth and metastasis.
Acss2/HIF-2 signaling favors cancer spread, whereas depleting Acss2 or HIF-2 reduces growth
and metastasis of fibrosarcoma-derived tumors in mice. Not surprisingly, Acss2 and HIF-2 are
over-expressed in cancers including soft tissue tumors. Because of its dual role in cytosolic
intermediary metabolism and nuclear signaling, Acss2 is considered a high value therapeutic target.
Indeed, reducing Acss2 levels blunts cancer growth in cell and mouse models including fibrosarcoma.
Although usually very stable, select mutations in the Acss2 carboxy terminal hinge region dramatically
shorten Acss2 half-life, which is due to unmasking of potent protein destabilizing elements (PDE) in
Acss2 that are normally hidden within an intra-molecular cage. When these PDE in Acss2 are
unmasked, the otherwise stable Acss2 protein is rapidly eliminated. Instability of Acss2 has functional
consequences as fibrosarcoma-derived cells expressing unstable Acss2 protein have markedly
reduced tumor growth and metastases in mice with flank tumors derived from these cells.
Our goal is to develop first-in-class drugs to treat fibrosarcoma and other cancers associated
with Agent Orange and burn pit exposure. In this proposal, we will identify small molecules that
unmask PDE in Acss2 and induce its elimination from cancer cells. To identify inducers of Acss2
degradation, we will screen a large chemical diversity library in collaboration with the Columbia
Genome Center High-Throughput Screening Facility using stable cell lines expressing enzymatic
(primary screen) or orthogonal fluorescent (secondary screen) reporters fused with portions of stable or
unstable Acss2 proteins. We will use cell-based assays to assess the impact of hits from this screen on
Acss2-specific features including protein levels, lipid synthesis, and cancer cell properties. Select
candidates will be further developed into compounds that ultimately will be tested for their ability to
reduce growth and metastasis of fibrosarcoma flank tumors in mice. Our overall objective is to use
these novel small molecule drugs as stand-alone or supplemental treatment for Veterans with
advanced stage fibrosarcoma and other cancers associated with Agent Orange and burn pit exposure."

Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a heterogeneous syndrome of lung inflammation, alveolar
capillary barrier dysfunction, and micro-thrombosis that is common in sepsis. Mortality is above 30% and no
pharmacotherapies exist for ARDS. We previously identified a reproducible association between ABO blood
type A and an approximately 14% higher absolute risk of ARDS compared to blood type O in sepsis. ABO
blood type is genetically determined by the ABO gene, which encodes a family of glycosyltransferases
responsible for catalyzing specific carbohydrate modifications on glycans and glycoproteins on erythrocytes,
endothelial cells, and platelets. The genetic variation that determines blood type is associated with risk to
multiple coagulopathic diseases, including myocardial infarction and venous thromboembolism, as well as
plasma levels of multiple endothelial-derived glycoproteins. Our published preliminary data, demonstrate an
association between the genetically determined A1 subtype of blood type A, distinguished by 30-50 fold higher
“A” transferase activity relative to the A2 subtype, and highest ARDS risk. Additionally, we identified an
association of blood type with plasma levels of two proteins measured early in sepsis and important in
endothelial activation and coagulation, von Willebrand factor (vWF) and soluble thrombomodulin (sTM), as well
as with risk of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). These same proteins have been implicated in
ARDS. On vWF, A antigens reduce degradation by ADAMTS13, resulting in a pro-coagulant effect, suggesting
septic blood type A patients may require higher ADAMTS13 levels. Therefore, we hypothesize that there is an
endotype of ARDS influenced by ABO blood type that can be identified and targeted clinically. The goals of the
research proposed in this application is to obtain critical information necessary to identify a population most
likely to benefit from therapies targeting ABO-influenced vascular biology and to understand the effect of ABO
glycans on injured lungs. We will accomplish this through the following Aims; Aim 1 will determine the
association of genetically determined ABO blood type A1 and mortality in sepsis and sepsis-associated ARDS,
in two large cohorts of critically ill sepsis patients. Aim 2 will derive and validate a predictive tool that includes
ABO genotype, plasma levels of vWF and sTM, and components of the DIC score to identify a population at
high risk for an ABO-defined coagulopathic endotype of ARDS in sepsis. Aim 3 will determine the longitudinal
physiologic effects of ABO blood type on lung injury recovery in an ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) model and
test if these effects are modified by the administration of recombinant ADAMTS13. The multidisciplinary team
of investigators includes a translational scientist and genetics expert (Meyer), two molecular epidemiologist
with expertise in ARDS and predictive modeling (Christie, Ware), an EVLP expert (Cantu), a bio-statistician
with a history of collaboration in critical care research (Feng), and the PI (Reilly), a translational epidemiologist
who first identified an association between ABO blood type and ARDS risk."
10927402,"PROJECT SUMMARY: PRECLINICAL IMAGING SHARED RESOURCE
Understanding complex biological phenomena often governing life and death in cancer patients requires
analysis and understanding at the single cell or molecular level, as well as a whole organ and/or systemic level
approach/understanding. The Preclinical Imaging Center (PIC) at UNMC houses specialized imaging
equipment from three complementary research cores (IVIS Optical Imaging, Ultrasonic Imaging, Multiphoton
Intravital and Tissue Imaging) to allow PFBCC researchers to readily transition across imaging modalities and
generate multi-level, multi-dimensional datasets. When used individually, or in combination to maximize impact
and rigor, the PIC provides researchers with all the tools necessary to evaluate critical morphological,
physiological, and/or cellular changes responsible for disease onset, progression, and response/resistance
across a diverse set of biological samples.
Within the PIC, innovative, comprehensive, and cost-effective imaging resources pertinent to a diverse
collection of cancer studies are available to BCC researchers. The IVIS Optical Imaging Core (IVIS Spectrum
In Vivo Imaging System) provides high throughput 2D and 3D imaging of both bioluminescent and fluorescent
reporters in live animals that can be evaluated in an anatomical context using the Digital Mouse Atlas or co-
registered with MRI or CT images. The Ultrasonic Imaging Core (US) houses multiple ultrasonic and
photoacoustic imaging technologies allowing researchers to perform basic ultrasound, contrast imaging,
Doppler, 3D and 4D imaging, and photoacoustic imaging in live animals. The Multiphoton Intravital and Tissue
Imaging Core (MITI) combines intravital microscopy and multiphoton excitation/imaging to provide both high-
resolution (submicron) and whole organ/tissue imaging in live animals, tissue explants, organoids, and various
fixed samples in 2D and 3D.
The PIC is a cancer-focused research center housed within a larger Small Animal Imaging Facility (SAIF)
providing BCC researchers with access to additional small animal imaging resources including, small animal
MRI, SPECT/CT, and Optical Surgical Navigation. Additional affiliated research cores (Advanced Microscopy,
Electron Microscopy, Image Guided Irradiation, Animal Behavior) provide complementary resources further
extending the research repertoire and data integration capabilities of our researchers. In addition to its
instrumentation, by providing custom-tailored, one-on-one training, and expertise/experience in experimental
design, image acquisition, and data analysis, the PIC provides cancer researchers with all the tools necessary
to achieve new insights into the most daunting of research challenges. Furthermore, with the shared resources
available at the PIC, BCC researchers have the exceptional opportunity to actively integrate imaging data
obtained from various translational animal models using multiple imaging technologies which both parallel, and
expand, clinical imaging modalities available on campus."

Atomic images of the arrangement of amino acid side chains in three dimensions give the atomic detail needed
to visualize the active sites of enzymes, see the DNA-binding sites of transcription factors, and view the
protein-protein interactions of signaling molecules. Function can be understood through the determination of
atomic structures by X-ray crystallography. Modification of the function of macromolecules is key to developing
specific therapies without side effects. In the absence of crystals, the molecular envelopes of macromolecular
complexes, individual proteins, and their gross conformational changes upon ligand binding can be determined
using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The SBF (Structural Biology Facility) was initiated many years ago,
through funding from the Nebraska Research Initiative (NRI) and the UNMC Vice Chancellor for Research
(VCR). Its expanding use by Cancer Center members and its important role in supporting the science of the
Cancer Center led to its designation as a Cancer Center core facility beginning in 2008. In the years 2013
through 2015, $1,741,452 was obtained from the NRI and VCR for upgrades. The SBF has four main
laboratory services:
1. Protein expression and purification (PrEP).
2. Crystal screening and growth (CSG).
3. X-ray (Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and single crystal diffraction).
5. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data collection.
The PrEP laboratory provides high-quality purified recombinant protein samples that can be isotopically labeled
for NMR data collection, ready for crystallization, or other experiments. The CSG laboratory includes state-of-
the-art robotic crystallization instruments with microscale capabilities. SAXS, single-crystal X-ray
crystallography, and NMR are used for structure determination. The SBF has two co-directors (one with
expertise in protein chemistry and X-ray methods and the other with expertise in NMR) who share the decision
making and have experience in structure determination. Two managers, a technician, and one postdoc are
employed to develop protein purification and crystallization protocols, maintain the high-tech instrumentation,
ensure that the best data is collected/processed, and train users/students."
10895370,"DEVELOPMENTAL RESEARCH PROGRAM (DRP): ABSTRACT
The Developmental Research Program (DRP) is an essential component of the Prostate SPORE, providing
yearly funding to 4-6 projects that are peer reviewed and deemed to have promising translational potential.
Funding is flexible, supporting projects for a period of two years or less. It is expected that DRP investigators
will develop and advance their pilots sufficiently to either replace main projects that are not progressing or will
secure independent funding in prostate cancer research. Of note, all three projects presented in the renewal
have emanated from pilot projects and propose translating discoveries made in the investigators’ labs to the
clinic. The DRP follows a highly structured process to solicit projects from investigators who are interested in
developing projects in the area of prostate cancer, to review projects according to NIH review criteria and to
monitor projects for scientific progress. The DRP is maintained throughout the entire period of SPORE funding.
The specific aims of the Developmental Research Program are:
• Specific Aim 1: To solicit, review and select innovative and translational pilot projects through the highly
 structured process. A request for applications (RFA) is sent out to investigators at the Northwestern University
 (NU), University of Chicago and its affiliated NorthShore University HealthSystems. The Scientific Review
 Committee reviews pilot projects based on the quality and importance to the overall SPORE mission.
• Specific Aim 2: To monitor progress of pilot projects within the context of the overall SPORE goals. Pilot project
 investigators are required to present their results twice per year at SPORE investigators meeting. They also
 meet twice per year with the Directors of the DRP to obtain translational insight and to ensure that scientific
 milestones are being achieved. DRP investigators are required to submit a written progress report that is
 rigorously evaluated by the SPORE PI and members of the Executive Committee.
• Specific Aim 3: To encourage and recruit additional investigators to pursue research in prostate cancer through
 a SPORE web site and by widely distributing the RFA announcing the availability of funds. Women and minority
 investigators are strongly encouraged to submit pilot projects.
• Specific Aim 4: To maintain the administrative process for the Developmental Research Program throughout
 the SPORE funding period."
10896473,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Walking is important for maintaining independence and is highly valued by older adults. Evidence continues to
accumulate on the positive impact of group exercise programs on the health of older adults. Our team
developed On the Move (OTM), a group exercise program to improve walking in older adults. A PCORI-funded
cluster randomized trial demonstrated that OTM was superior to a usual care exercise program for improving
walking ability. Though we and others have demonstrated the benefits of improving mobility through exercise,
the programs are seldom used outside of the research setting (i.e. evidence-practice gap). In our PCORI trial,
we began to address this evidence-practice gap by conducting OTM in community settings, however, the
intervention was delivered by research personnel. The next step in the development of OTM as a fully
implementable intervention is to conduct an effectiveness (Stage IV) study in which the intervention is
delivered in community settings by community providers. Interventions tested in highly controlled trials often do
not yield the same outcomes when applied in a real-life context in effectiveness trials. Poor intervention fidelity
may cause this dilution of effect, as it can reduce intervention potency and potentially lead to faulty conclusions
about (lack of) effectiveness. When transitioning from more controlled to less controlled environments it is
imperative to monitor and measure intervention fidelity to accurately interpret the research findings. Therefore,
we propose a Hybrid I trial, which blends effectiveness and implementation (i.e. intervention fidelity) research
aims. Using a cluster-randomized trial, we will test the effectiveness of OTM in terms of improving mobility
among 502 older adults in 44 senior community centers (Aim 1) and evaluate intervention fidelity, including
adherence and competence, and the impact of organizational, instructor, and participant level factors on
intervention fidelity (Aim 2). We will also determine the extent to which intervention fidelity moderates the
effectiveness of OTM (Aim 3). This study is significant in that it addresses walking limitations, a common and
costly problem for older adults and it transitions a clinical exercise program to the community. Clinical and
research programs are available to a select group of individuals. Transitioning to a community-based program
delivered by community instructors will greatly increase the reach of OTM. By meeting older adults where they
live (urban, rural, high/low resource areas), OTM will have a much wider impact on walking and health. Our
results will impact the field by demonstrating the real-world effectiveness of OTM as a health promotion
program for improving mobility in older adults thus decreasing the research-practice gap."
10688036,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall goal of this proposal is to identify fundamental mechanisms controlling allergic responses by the long
non-coding RNA (lncRNA) Morrbid. Type 2 allergic responses are characterized by the generation of CD4+ T
helper type 2 (Th2) cells, and the recently identified IL-13+ T follicular helper (Tfh13) cells, which drive production
of high-affinity anaphylactic IgE. Given their central role in allergy, understanding how T cells are programmed
to become Th2 and Tfh13 cells could allow manipulation of T cell responses to mitigate allergy. Recent work has
revealed a critical function for lncRNAs in immunity, opening up an exciting area of research that may uncover
new targets and pathways for therapeutic intervention. lncRNAs do not encode proteins; rather, many produce
functional RNA transcripts that are powerful regulators of cellular identity, function and survival. Our preliminary
data show that the lncRNA Morrbid controls CD4+ T cell function and is required for type 2 immune responses
in vivo. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq) of CD4+ T cells revealed Morrbid to be most highly expressed
in Il13-expressing Th2 and Tfh13 cells, and Tfh13 cells are reduced during type 2 responses in Morrbid-/- mice.
Our hypothesis is that Morrbid is an epigenetic regulator of Th2 and Tfh13 differentiation during allergic
responses. In Aim 1 we will identify cell types that require Morrbid to generate type 2 immune responses. Using
mice with a conditional Morrbid allele crossed to different Cre-expressing lines, we will test the function of Morrbid
in dendritic cells, B cells, T cells, and Tfh cells during type 2 responses in vivo. We will analyze expression of
human MORRBID in T cells from donors with or without allergies using scRNA-Seq, to determine whether Th2
and Tfh cells overexpress MORRBID in allergy. Finally, using CRISPR/Cas9-based epigenome editing in primary
human T cells, we will determine the impact of MORRBID silencing and overexpression on CD4+ T helper cell
polarization in vitro. In Aim 2 we will dissect molecular mechanisms by which the Morrbid locus regulates gene
expression in T cells. To this end we have developed a novel genetic targeting strategy based on pre-tRNA
processing to ablate lncRNA transcripts without blocking transcription in vivo. In Aim 3 we will map the Morrbid
interactome to determine how Morrbid controls T cell function. To identify genes directly bound by Morrbid, we
will employ a novel method that allows simultaneous mapping of both lncRNA-chromatin interactions and
lncRNA-associated chromatin loops genome-wide, called RNA ChIA-PET (RNA-Chromatin Interaction Analysis
by Paired-End Tag sequencing). To identify regulatory proteins interacting with Morrbid, we will use RAP-MS
(RNA Antisense Purification coupled with Mass Spectrometry). Through completion of these Aims, we will
elucidate new regulatory pathways controlling type 2 immunity that could potentially be exploited to treat allergy.
In addition, we will have established and validated two novel tools of significant benefit to the research community
which suffers from a dearth of standard methodology for analyzing lncRNA function; a lncRNA-specific gene-
targeting approach, and a method to map genome-wide lncRNA-associated chromosomal interactions."

Cutting-edge technologies are generating large datasets across biological processes, including those following
viral infection and host responses. However, lack of computational tools that can extract meaningful insights,
and lack of ability to integrate information across different model systems and data modalities, are roadblocks to
deriving biological and mechanistic understanding of these processes. The recent rise of devastating viruses
including SARS family viruses reveals that a deeper, basic mechanistic understanding of viral infection is still
lacking. Specifically, new insights into early viral infection (asymptomatic replication phase) and early-responding
genes that govern infection and disease outcome are critical for understanding progression of infection and host
responses. During my postdoctoral research, I developed several widely-used algorithms for biomedical machine
learning and single-cell data analysis, and applied these to a broad range of biological systems, including
infectious disease. Here, I propose to develop a completely new approach that is founded in cross-modal
computational analysis and can be applied to dynamic processes across living systems. In this proposal, the
method will be trained upon and applied to uncovering virus infection dynamics. By leveraging single-cell
technologies, combinatorial CRISPR perturbation, and advanced machine learning, this new approach will learn
the gene regulatory logic that governs infection. By spanning model systems, I will extract information that can
be derived more cleanly from in-vitro systems, such as early infection timepoints. Through cross-integration of
these data with in-vivo data from mouse models we will bring the precision questions that can be asked in human
organoids together with the physiological environment of animal models, powering our ability to derive relevant
insights into gene networks underlying a complex, dynamic process. I will build a single-cell atlas of virus infection
and train a machine learning algorithm to obtain a predictive model of infection dynamics. By also integrating
data from single-cell combinatorial CRISPR perturbation, I will infer causal gene networks as well as synergistic
gene interactions that govern infection dynamics. This combination of advanced machine learning methods,
large-scale single-cell analysis, and gene perturbation data will allow discovery of the drivers of infection,
signatures of both susceptibility and protection, and gene networks that can ultimately be targeted for therapeutic
intervention. Synergistic gene interactions will open up future paths to potentially more effective, specific, and
even combinatorial therapies. The innovative coupling of computational methods and deep data collection to
extract information, particularly during early infection phases, has the potential to fundamentally change our
understanding of viral infections, as well as provide a framework that can be applied to a broad range of biological
processes and diseases to obtain deep mechanistic understanding."

In East Asia and Oceania Plasmodium vivax is the most common cause of malaria. Relapses occur in over half
the infections and comprise the main burden of P. vivax malaria. Relapses are the major cause of morbidity,
particularly in children and pregnant women. In recent years targeted malaria elimination has driven down
Plasmodium falciparum malaria in these populous regions, but P. vivax malaria has re-emerged rapidly
because of relapse. Preventing relapse (radical cure) requires administration of an 8-aminoquinoline – which
until recently meant a 7-14 day course of primaquine. Tafenoquine is a recently registered slowly eliminated 8-
aminoquinoline with the substantial operational advantage of providing single dose radical cure. However,
Phase 3 randomized controlled trials showed that the currently recommended 300mg adult dose (~ 5mg/kg) of
tafenoquine had low radical curative efficacy against P. vivax malaria. Tafenoquine doses up to 14mg/kg have
proved safe and well tolerated in adults and children with >70% G6PD activity. We obtained the individual
participant (N= 1102) data from the Phase 3 pre-registration trials (DETECTIVE and GATHER; see
Bibliography, references 22-24). Individual patient data meta-analysis (see Bibliography, reference 32) shows
clearly that a) the dose response curve is steep around the currently recommended dose (5mg/kg) and b) the
odds ratio for P. vivax recurrence (<4 months) is 0.69 (95% CI 0.64 to 0.75; p=10-21) for each mg/kg increase in
dose. Thus, increasing the dose by half (i.e., to 7.5mg/kg) is predicted to result in an overall >90% reduction of
P. vivax recurrence. To test this prediction, we propose conducting a multi-center double-blind randomized
clinical trial in five countries in the Greater Mekong sub-Region. Aim 1 compares the radical curative efficacies
of the current tafenoquine dose and a 50% higher dose (e.g., 300mg versus 450mg in persons ≥35kg) in adults
and children with acute vivax malaria and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity >70%.
Relapses will be distinguished from reinfections probabilistically based on parasite genotyping and time to
event information. To detect very low-density P. vivax parasitemias which might be suppressed by tafenoquine,
ultrasensitive polymerase chain reaction (uPCR) will be performed. Aim 2 assesses plasma, urine, and red
blood cell tafenoquine concentrations and explores potential tafenoquine metabolites. Genotyping for CYP2D6
mutations and measurements of methemoglobinemia will be included as exposure correlates of radical
curative efficacy. Aim 3 assesses safety and tolerability of the higher tafenoquine dose. Tolerability,
gastrointestinal symptoms, hematocrit, and elevated blood methemoglobin concentrations will be monitored.
This study will provide definitive evidence to guide tafenoquine dosing for the radical cure of P. vivax malaria.
An efficacious, safe and well tolerated single dose anti-relapse therapeutic will substantially improve the
treatment of P. vivax malaria and accelerate malaria elimination."

Infectious diseases are a growing threat to public health owing to increasing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and
stagnation in new antibiotic development. Left unchecked, the annual number of deaths attributable to AMR is
estimated to reach 10 million by 2050, exceeding deaths due to cancers and diabetes. Thus, there is an urgent
need to develop innovative approaches to tackle this serious global crisis. We aim to develop a new class of
dual-stimuli responsive polysaccharide-coated nanoparticles (NP) capable of encapsulating a wide range of
FDA-approved antibiotics to effectively treat multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial infections. The polysaccharide
NP shell ensures good stability and long blood circulation time, thus leading to high NP accumulation in the
infected tissues via the enhanced permeation and retention effect. Furthermore, polysaccharides enable the NP
to physically bind the pathogens due to multivalent affinity for bacterial lectins. The uniquely engineered NP is
activated by high levels of ROS and/or low pH in the inflammatory microenvironment to release both cationic
antimicrobial polymers and antibiotics that show a strong synergy to combat MDR pathogens. The cationic
polymers can induce pores on the bacterial cell membrane, and significantly diminish the intrinsic resistance of
the pathogens by enhancing the transport of antibiotics into the bacteria and allowing them to bypass the efflux
pump. The cationic polymers released in the infected tissues can also agglomerate the pathogens and shape a
microenvironment entrapping a high level of antimicrobial materials, thus leading to high antimicrobial efficacy.
Moreover, the NP can penetrate through bacterial biofilms, and enhance the uptake of antibiotics by macro-
phages, thereby effectively eliminating notoriously challenging biofilm and intracellular infections, respectively.
Finally, the cationic polymer contains GSH-cleavable bonds in its main chain, which can be readily degraded in
the cytosol of mammalian cells, thereby sidestepping the problem of dose-limiting toxicity with other cationic
polymers. Following on our successful pilot studies, we will systematically optimize and characterize NPs tailored
to treat four different MDR pathogens. In Aim 1, we will determine the optimal polysaccharide NP shell, antibiotics,
and NP formulation for each of the four MDR pathogens. In Aim 2, we will study the candidate NPs’ antimicrobial
and antibiofilm efficacy, drug resistance development profile, and biocompatibility to gain a fundamental
understanding of the design rules for efficacious and safe antimicrobial NP against pathogens of interest. In Aim
3, we will determine the maximum tolerated dose, systemic toxicity, immunological consequences, in vivo
biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, and antimicrobial efficacy of the selected NPs in healthy mice and three
clinically relevant animal infection models. Altogether, this study will lead to a new class of antimicrobial NPs
based on disease-specific stimuli, a unique dual-stimuli responsive and biocompatible cationic polymer we
engineered, polysaccharides targeting MDR pathogens, and FDA-approved antibiotics. If successful, it will offer
a general, yet effective and safe solution to effectively eliminate the most prevalent MDR pathogens."

The Washington University Specialized Program of Research Excellence (SPORE) in Pancreatic Cancer is a
highly translational cancer research program focused entirely on the deadliest form of the disease, pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Our outstanding investigators have complementary expertise in basic and
clinical studies, and our teams leverage individual expertise in immunology, cancer biology, drug development,
genomics, and clinical care to develop novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for PDAC.
 This SPORE application includes three research projects, an administrative core (Core A), two shared-
resource cores [Biospecimen Core (Core B) and Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core (Core C)], and
developmental research (DRP) and career enhancement (CEP) programs. In collaboration with our External
(EAB) and Internal (IAB) Advisory Boards, we intentionally selected projects with the greatest potential to impact
the outcome for patients with PDAC. Basic research at WUSM and UPenn has led to the development of the
following three research projects, all of which feature innovative investigator-initiated therapeutic trials for PDAC.
All projects deemed to have the most potential for translational impact and share an immunologic theme in their
approach. This immunologic theme leverages institutional strengths and highlights our team’s expertise and
leadership in this field. Thus far, the immunologic and metabolic therapies that have been increasingly successful
for controlling other cancer types have not been impactful in PDAC. Our project leaders have made noteworthy
contributions to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this immunologic resistance and drug resistance in PDAC
and developed several exciting strategies with potential to overcome these obstacles. The three projects in this
application are designed to have significant potential to change clinical practice within 5 years.
Project 1. Employing CD11b-agonists to render PDAC responsive to immunotherapy
Project 2. Mechanisms of Resistance to Neoantigen Vaccines in PDAC
Project 3. Targeting Stress-induced MK2 as Novel Strategy in Pancreatic Cancer
 Our long-term goals are to improve the survival and the quality of life of patients diagnosed with PDAC. To
achieve this goal, we will promote institutional and inter-institutional collaborative research, with an emphasis on
translation. We anticipate that no singular approach will solve PDAC and fully commit to supporting the
development of novel research concepts as well as highly promising young investigators. Our SPORE will
provide access to pancreatic cancer–specific resources to facilitate this mission."

Project Title: Development of a Small Molecule Inhibitor of Fortilin for Atherosclerosis Treatment and
Prevention. Atherosclerosis affects more than 18 million Americans and is a major cause of cardiovascular
diseases and acute cardiovascular events, such as heart attack and stroke. Current interventions include
changes to diet and exercise, smoking cessation, and treatment with statins, but many patients struggle to
adhere to lifestyle interventions and can experience significant side effects while taking statins. Although lipid
lowering drugs have benefited patients with atherosclerosis, the idea that lipid lowering halts the progression of
atherosclerosis is not valid because factors other than hypercholesterolemia have been shown to promote
atherosclerosis. Therefore, there is a clear need for novel therapeutics that can directly inhibit plaque formation
through a mechanism other than lipid lowering. Fortiscience, Inc. is developing an alternative therapeutic
approach that inhibits fortilin, a key protein involved in atherosclerotic plaque formation. Fortilin protects
macrophages against apoptosis in atherosclerotic intima, allowing them to proliferate and produce inflammatory
cytokines. Strikingly, global knockdown of fortilin protects hypercholesterolemic mice against atherosclerosis
without lowering cholesterol. Three small molecular weight compounds identified in preliminary work at the
University of Washington have been shown to have activity in relevant in vitro and in vivo models, and these
compounds have been used as the basis for designing and synthesizing 52 additional compounds with higher
binding affinity through a medicinal chemistry approach. In this Phase I STTR project, to be conducted in
collaboration with the University of Washington and the University of Notre Dame, 10 prioritized compounds will
be evaluated using cell-based fortilin degradation and foam cell formation assays to assess activity (measuring
the EC50) and cell death assays to determine cytotoxicity (LC50). Based on an analysis of the structure–activity
relationship for these compounds, computational virtual docking assays will be performed to design and
produce 3-5 new compounds with improved fortilin binding affinity. The binding affinity, activity, toxicity, and
stability of these compounds will then be measured, and the data will be used to select a lead compound with a
single-nanomolar dissociation constant, a lower EC50 value than the previous best-performing compound, and
low clearance in liver microsome assays (CLint below 15 mL min-1kg-1). Further, pharmacokinetic and toxicity
profiles will be determined for the lead compound in a 15-day oral dose range finding study in C57BL/6 mice.
Finally, the anti-atherosclerotic activity of the lead compound will be determined in the aortae of
hypercholesterolemic mice following 12 weeks of oral administration, with the goal of achieving a 50%
reduction in atherosclerosis. This work is designed to provide the necessary proof-of-concept data to support
further pre-clinical studies in Phase II and a future first-in-human clinical trial to establish the safety of the drug."

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating interstitial lung disease characterized by progressive lung
function decline survival worse than most cancers. Despite high mortality, the trajectory of IPF progression is
highly heterogeneous. This heterogeneity hampers drug development, as large sample sizes are required when
conducting IPF clinical trials to ensure enough patients experience forced vital capacity (FVC) decline to detect
a treatment effect. The ability to predict IPF progression trajectory, however, remains elusive. Emerging
proteomic platforms provide a valuable opportunity to address this gap in knowledge. In Aim 1, we will validate
proteomic biomarkers of IPF progression. Using a high-throughput, semi-quantitative proteomic platform, we
will determine plasma concentration for ~3000 analytes in the UK-based PROFILE cohort (n=550) and perform.
targeted analysis of 258 preliminary biomarkers of one-year categorical IPF progression identified in a discovery
cohort from the Pulmonary Fibrosis Foundation (n=813). In aim 2, we will derive and validate a proteomic
signature of FVC trajectory. Machine learning will be applied to semi-quantitative proteomic data to select
proteins for quantitative signature development. A custom, quantitative platform will be developed and used to
quantify selected proteins, with data used to develop a proteomic signature of one-year FVC trajectory. This
signature will then be assessed in three prospectively recruited IPF cohorts. In aim 3, we will determine whether
anti-fibrotic therapy modulates biomarkers of IPF progression. Quantitative proteomic data will be
generated for 240 treatment-naïve patients and repeated at 12-months after 80 patients each received
pirfenidone, nintedanib or no therapy. Longitudinal change in biomarker concentration and test performance
characteristics will be compared between treatment groups before and after anti-fibrotic initiation. Successful
completion of this proposal will identify novel molecular mediators of IPF progression and result in a highly
significant biomarker signature to predict IPF progression trajectory. This tool has high potential to speed drug
development through clinical trial enrichment, making precision medicine a reality in patients with IPF."

Aura is a digital health platform that uses Epilog™, a miniature, wireless, wearable EEG sensor worn on the
scalp below hairline that can record clinical and subclinical seizures. After an initial diagnosis of epilepsy, an
epileptologist will use known information about patients’ seizures to guide the best scalp location to place the
Epilog EEG sensor (A). EEG data is continuously transferred (B) to the Aura app on a person’s smartphone (C)
using secure BluetoothTM where it communicates over WiFi (D) to the Aura cloud platform (E). Epilog EEG is
analyzed for seizures and a daily digital seizure diary is shared with epileptologists (F) and pushed back to the
Aura app (G). Epilog is recharged daily, and reusable for a year. Epilog is designed to be discreet, allowing for
continuous use in all facets of daily life.
Data are a 10 s snippet of the beginning of a focal seizure with motor impairment and intact awareness (ILAE
1A1) recorded from Epitel’s single-channel Epilog sensor placed on the left forehead. The patient was admitted
for video-EEG monitoring as standard-of-care. This seizure was verified independently by three epileptologists.
In Phase I, automated, machine learning-based seizure detection algorithms will be designed to first work in the
Aura cloud to detect seizures in Epilog EEG, including seizures a person may not consciously know they are
having (>50% of all seizures), such as while sleeping. Aura will run these algorithms developed exclusively for
Epilog’s single-channel of EEG to provide a daily digital seizure diary.
In Phase II, the Aura system will enter clinical validation trials for FDA clearance as an EEG-based automated
home seizure detection and alerting system. Early in Phase II Aura will be commercialized as a medical
device-enabled-service business model. Out-of-pocket costs for a person living with epilepsy is an average of
$380/year. Armed with long-term, reproducible EEG, epileptologists will now have a more precise, quantitative
record of seizure counts, enabling them to adapt patient treatment more rapidly and successfully to improve
quality of life. Aura will give people living with epilepsy their lives back. Aura provides certainty where you are
and when you need it. Throughout Phase II, physiological, psychological, behavioral, and environmental factors
will be combined in the Aura app to collect 27,000 days of multi-modal data from 300 patients to create an
unprecedented dataset of features known to precipitate seizures.
These data will be used in Phase III to create a robust, wearable seizure forecasting system using artificial
intelligence that combines multi-modal seizure precipitating factors, creating an hourly seizure probability.
Aura will profoundly disrupt how epilepsy is managed and improve the quality of life of people living with epilepsy."
10890108,"The Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory proposes to continue two courses in molecular
biology, molecular genetics and biochemistry, whose methodologies are central for
modern cancer research, to be held in 2023 - 2027. These short, intensive courses include
Mouse Development, Stem Cells & Cancer (three weeks) and Chromatin, Epigenetics
and Gene Expression (three weeks). Each course prepares the student to enter directly
into research that makes use of advanced and/or specialized techniques and concepts
that can be applied to studies of growth and regulation of normal eukaryotic cells and their
oncogenic counterparts. Each course has a different emphasis and serves a different
need. The course on Mouse Development, Stem Cells & Cancer trains scientists to study
gene regulation and development in the context of the whole organism, as well as mouse
models of human disease such as cancer. The course provides in intensive hands-on
introduction to engineering of mouse models, stem cell technologies and tissue analyses.
Lectures provide the conceptual basis for contemporary research in embryogenesis,
organogenesis in development and disease, embryonic, adult and induced pluripotent
stem cells and cancer biology. The course on Chromatin, Epigenetics and Gene
Expression aims to expose students to a broad array of methodologies to study gene
regulation, chromatin structure and epigenetics, including both well-developed and
cutting-edge methods, such as ChIP, CRISPR and Next Generation Sequencing. The
faculty is chosen on the basis of their contributions to and knowledge of the field covered
in each course. The faculty invite lecturers who have made significant contributions to
their fields and can provide up-to-the-minute reports on current research. The trainees
range from graduate students to senior investigators who are chosen by the course faculty
from a large number of applicants. Because of the short duration of the courses, senior,
as well as junior, individuals can attend and receive an intense period of training in an
environment remote from other demands on their on their time and attention. The courses
provide an unusual opportunity for scientists to retrain in another specialty or to apply the
work of a new field to their own research."
10897332,"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) are two age-related
neurodegenerative diseases that share genetic and pathological underpinnings. Recently, disruptions to the
composition and function nuclear pore complex (NPC) have been identified as a prominent and early
pathomechanism underlying neurodegenerative diseases including ALS, AD/FTD, and HD. As the NPC and
surrounding nuclear envelope (NE) environment critically control fundamental cellular processes including
nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT), gene expression, and genome organization, NPC and NE homeostasis is
essential for neuronal function and survival. Using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived neurons
(iPSNs) and postmortem human CNS tissues, we have recently identified a significant injury to the NPC
characterized by the reduction in specific Nups from the human neuronal NPC that culminates in impaired
nuclear protein import and contributes to the dysfunction and mislocalization of the RNA binding protein TDP-
43, a prominent pathological event in neurodegeneration. This NPC injury cascade is initiated by the aberrant
nuclear accumulation of CHMP7 in sALS and C9orf72 ALS/FTD neurons. CHMP7 is an ESCRT-III protein that
while normally localized predominantly to the cytoplasm, is thought to function primarily in ESCRT-III mediated
nuclear surveillance events. The cell biological events and molecular mechanisms underlying CHMP7’s
contribution to NPC and NE surveillance and homeostasis are beginning to be understood in yeast and non-
neuronal mammalian cells during cell division, NE breakdown, and NPC insertion. However, little is understood
regarding CHMP7’s role in maintaining NPC and NE homeostasis in long-lived, non-dividing human neurons
where NPC components are infrequently exchanged, and NE breakdown does not routinely occur. Our
preliminary data highlight the fact that the molecular events that regulate the nuclear localization and activation
of CHMP7 mediated nuclear surveillance in neurons are not perfectly concordant with those recently identified
in yeast and dividing mammalian cells suggestive of distinct neuronal mechanisms that give rise to CHMP7
initiated pathogenic cascades in ALS/FTD. In the proposed studies, we will employ iPSNs from a large number
of sALS and C9orf72 ALS/FTD patients and appropriate controls and utilize a combination of candidate based
siRNA knockdown, biochemical protein interaction techniques, recently developed and optimized live cell and
super resolution imaging strategies, and expression of a newly generated CHMP7 variant plasmid library.
Collectively, these studies will identify the molecular mechanisms that facilitate the nuclear entry (Aim 1) and
nuclear export (Aim 2) of CHMP7 as well as the initiation of CHMP7 mediated NPC injury (Aim 3) to give rise to
NPC injury cascades in ALS/FTD. Therefore, these studies will provide an essential understanding of the cell
biological and molecular events that facilitate CHMP7 mediated NPC injury in human neurons and provide
insights into therapeutic strategies for alleviating this early and significant pathogenic cascade in ALS/FTD."

 Administrative Core: Abstract
The overall goal of the administrative core is to provide oversight to all administrative, fiscal, and
communication/partnership needs for the P20 collaboration between the California State University, Fullerton
(CSUF) and the University of California, Irvine, Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCI-CFCCC). The
specific aims are the same as the overall component, and include the following: to plan, implement and evaluate
a highly integrated and interactive cancer health disparities partnership between CSUF and UCI-CFCCC; to
conduct pilot cancer health disparities research projects involving at least one investigator at each institution that
advance knowledge regarding cancer health disparities, leading to the submission of competitive grant
applications by NIH/NCI and other federal/non-federal agencies; and to provide cancer research education to
underrepresented undergraduate and graduate students to increase their understanding of cancer health
disparities, leading to a larger pool of highly talented future scientists from diverse backgrounds.
To accomplish this we will undertake a set of activities organized under four components. The Adminstrative
Core will be responsible for the overall administrative and fiscal aspects of all P20 activities, and will include the
Executive Committee and Internal Advisory Committee. Activities will be implemented in three stages: initial
planning, implementation, and evaluation. The evaluation effort will be spearheaded by an external evaluator
with expertise in multi-component center reviews. The long term goals of this collaborative partnership are to
diversity the cancer research workforce and ultimately increase our scientific impact to address the cancer health
disparity needs of the large geographic areas between CSUF and UCI-CFCCC that comprise the cancer center's
catchment area."
10907504,"Pilot Project 2: Project Summary
Ovarian cancer is a highly fatal disease with a five-year relative survival of less than 50%. However, ovarian
cancer survival is not the same for all women. Asian American ovarian cancer patients have the highest survival
across all major racial groups, however the Asian American population is heterogeneous. Studies have shown
that analyzing Asian Americans as a single group overlooks important ethnic-specific disparities, and this has
been observed for ovarian cancer. Hence, this pilot project aims to better understand these disparities using data
from the California Cancer Registry (CCR). The CCR is an ideal data source for this project given that it includes
detailed demographic, socioeconomic, tumor, and treatment information by Asian subethnic group and covers
the geographic region in the United States that is home to the largest number of Asian Americans.
Our preliminary analyses of Asian American ovarian cancer patients using data in the CCR showed ethnic-
specific percent differences for several survival-related characteristics. To clarify these differences, Aim 1 of this
project will examine the association between Asian subethnic group and ovarian cancer tumor characteristics.
Certain Asian subethnic groups may be more likely to present with ovarian cancers of a particular grade, stage,
or histology, hence the ethnic-specific survival disparities may be attributed to the tumors themselves. Aim 2 of
this project will examine whether receipt of National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline adherent
care and its association with ovarian cancer survival differ across Asian subethnic groups. NCCN guideline
consensus statements reflect the most current and accepted standard for cancer treatment, hence the ethnic-
specific survival disparities may be attributed to the treatment and care received. Certain Asian subethnic groups
may be more likely to receive NCCN adherent care and receipt of that care may be differentially associated with
survival.
Given the fatality of ovarian cancer, understanding why some women die from ovarian cancer while others do
not is a public health priority. Few ovarian cancer studies have focused on Asian Americans, hence this pilot
project will not only shed light on an understudied segment of the population, but will do so in a way that
recognizes the importance of the population’s heterogeneity so ethnic-specific disparities are not overlooked.
Understanding how ovarian tumors and treatment care may differ by Asian subethnic group will inform the future
work that is needed to understand the underlying factors contributing to ovarian cancer disparities and survival
overall."

 Cancer Research Education Program (CREP): Abstract
The long-term goal of the Cancer-Related Education Program (CREP) is to increase the diversity of the cancer
research workforce by training undergraduate and master’s graduate students in cancer health disparities-
related research efforts, especially those from underrepresented groups. This objective will be accomplished
through providing education in the cancer health disparities field, including established facts as well as the
newest research exploring the interrelationships of biological components, socioeconomic factors, cultural
aspects, nutrition, stress, and the environment that result in certain groups bearing a disproportionate burden
of cancer. A profound understanding of the biological bases of cancer as well as of cancer disparities aspects
such as differences in incidence, prevalence, morbidity and mortality, quality of life while on treatment, length
of survivorship, and access to diagnosis will inspire students to pursue research career on these topics and
result in a highly diverse pool of highly talented future scientists from different backgrounds. The proposed
CSUF/UCI-CFCCC partnership is particularly suited for this goal because of our ethnically diverse student
populations and the high number of students from low socioeconomic backgrounds. CREP will consist of a 5-
term (undergraduates) or 3-term (graduates) path that will provide a comprehensive education. The specific
aims of the CREP are to: 1. Develop coursework paths and research experiences focused on cancer disparities
and other cancer topics; 2. Create synergistic educational components such as community building activities
and travel to research conferences; and 3. Establish outreach opportunities that help prepare CREP students
to succeed in transitioning to higher degree programs and inform faculty and students outside of the program
about the need to research and mitigate cancer health disparities. To accomplish these aims, we will undertake
a robust association between the two institutions. The educational paths will include instruction in basic
concepts and the newest research on cancer and cancer disparities. CREP scholars will also experience
summer research training in a laboratory of their choice within a rich list of opportunities at CSUF or UCI. In
addition to the documented benefits of supplemental coursework and research training, CREP students will
benefit from opportunities and experiences, offering them a variety of identity and community building activities
as well as travel to research conferences. Several outreach activities will be organized at CSUF and UCI to
disseminate information about the program and the importance of cancer research and cancer disparities. The
evaluation will capture the number of students progressing through these activities, monitor their progress and
relationships with faculty mentors, and track their future careers. CREP activities will increase the pool of
talented underrepresented students who enter the cancer-related research workforce in the future.

10741835,"PROJECT SUMMARY
American Indian (AI) populations have had the largest increase in suicide rates of any ethnic group in that past
decade and have high rates of mental health concerns such as post-traumatic stress, substance use, anxiety,
and mood disorders. However, previous research and preliminary analyses demonstrated that AIs actually
display lower levels of mental health concerns than broader populations when accounting for increased levels
of risk factors, (e.g., trauma exposure). Extant literature indicates that factors associated with AI culture are
protective against poor mental health. Yet, little is known about how cultural factors (e.g., enculturation, social
support) play a protective role. There are no published studies examining neural underpinnings of the
protective role of AI cultural factors. Filling this gap is a critical step in supporting an experimental therapeutics
approach to developing culturally informed prevention and intervention efforts. Cognitive control is a
neurocognitive function that is implicated across numerous psychiatric disorders, can be assessed with
validated behavioral and neuroimaging tasks, and has been well-delineated in regard to underlying neural
circuitry. The aims of the proposal are to (a) determine whether cultural protective factors relate to behavioral
and neural indicators of cognitive control, as measured during electroencephalography and functional magnetic
resonance imaging and (b) develop an experimental, cultural identification paradigm to serve as the basis for
future culturally-informed neuroscientific research and intervention/prevention efforts.
A community based participatory research (CBPR) framework will be used to recruit participants who have
completed multimodal neural and behavioral indicators of cognitive control, clinical interviews, self-report
measures of psychopathology symptoms and global functioning as part of a previous study. They will complete
self-report measures of enculturation, social support, global functioning and a cultural enhancement induction
paradigm developed using a CBPR framework. These data will provide an essential foundation for developing
culturally informed, evidence-based intervention and prevention efforts aimed at reducing the mental health
disparities among AIs. The proposed training plan will expand Dr. White expertise in neuroscientific
mechanisms of cognitive control through mentorship, coursework, and hands-on training in advanced statistical
methods, multimodal (EEG/fMRI) neuroimaging, clinical neuroscience, and culturally informed research. He
has assembled a team of mentors well suited to provide the required diversity of expertise he needs to achieve
independence. Dr. Martin Paulus will provide expertise neuroimaging and advanced data analytic expertise.
Dr. Aupperle will bring extensive experience related to neuroimaging and clinically relevant neuroscience
approaches. Dr. Lowe will provide expertise and experiences in AI culturally informed research. The training
and associated research will be conducted at LIBR, a state-of-the-art institute dedicated to neuroimaging
research aimed at developing more effective treatments for neuropsychiatric disorders."

This Administrative Core has been managing the activities of the Seattle MDCRC since May 2014. The Core
will continue to provide oversight, coordinate activities and manage budgetary activities. We will assume
responsibilities for outreach activities, help promote a seminar series in coordination with a Training Core.
The Core will be directed by Jeffrey S. Chamberlain, Ph.D. with assistance from Stephen Tapscott, M.D./Ph.D.
Daily operations of the Core will be handled by Ms. Roberta Miller. The Core will be responsible for overseeing
all activities of this Center. This includes budgetary oversight, ensuring compliance with regulatory
requirements, managing resource and data sharing, coordinating travel, managing progress reports and
facilitating access and interaction with the Resource (Vector) Core. This Administrative Core will also work
closely with the Training Core to facilitate mentoring, seminars, lectures and attendance at meetings and
symposia. Coordination will be aided by a Center Executive Committee composed of the PIs and key
members of each Core and Project. We will also seek advice and critiques from our current Center Advisory
Committee. Integration and oversight will also be facilitated by a Center web site managed by this Core. This
publically accessible web site will promote the Center’s mission with summaries of activities and progress,
provide links to publications and events, advertise opportunities related to training and research, provide a
portal to affiliated lab web sites, and links to contact Center members with questions, requests for

10922771,"Training Core – Project Summary:The major goals of this MDSRC Training Core are to 1) train the next
generation of scientists/clinicians to perform translational research and implement clinical studies in muscular
dystrophies (MD), 2) provide educational and outreach activities to patients and their families, and 3) to serve as
a liaison between the muscular dystrophy clinical and research communities and patient advocacy
organizations. We propose a training core to 1) provide a mentored research training program in translational
and clinical research and ethics that will inspire and prepare talented new investigators to address the critical
needs of individuals with MD, 2) develop programs that engage researchers in the Pacific Northwest and our
affiliates in MD research, and 3) increase awareness in the public and patient communities of MD clinical and
related research efforts. The cost of training researchers continues to rise while funding to support training
programs has remained stagnant. Our approach to mitigate this issue within our training program will be to
leverage other University of Washington (UW) departments/institutes and private sector partners to provide
trainee fellowships, and to use established UW resources to provide educational opportunities. Members of our
MDSRC are involved in UW’s Institute of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Center for Translational Muscle
Research (CTMR), and the Institute of Translational Health Sciences (ITHS); many of us are also part of the
Bioengineering, Cardiovascular Training Program (BCTP), Cellular and Molecular Biology Program & the
Biochemistry graduate programs, all of which provide trainee programs that we utilize. In addition to an
MDSRC-specific symposium highlighting speakers from UW and outside institutions, cross program symposia
and training programs will expand the training we can provide our trainees. ITHS’s career development
programs, ITHS and Dept of Neurology grant writing programs, and a cross-institute Biomedical Research
Integrity program will round out the training for clinician and researchers. Our MDSRC will also initiate an annual
workshop open to students/trainees at all levels in all disciplines to educate them on muscular dystrophy and
the research we undertake, and we sponsor a seminar series. To encourage interactions between basic
scientists and clinicians, our research labs work closely with MDA clinics and clinicians at UW and Seattle
Children’s Hospitals (Wang), as well as with the Medical Centers affiliated with Project 2 at the Universities of
Kansas (Statland), Nevada (Jones) and Rochester (Tawil). We also organize workshops to bring patients and
their families to joint sessions with clinicians and researchers, increasing our outreach and providing a space for
patients to educate and impact trainees on their perspectives and concerns. Overall, our plan is to foster an
environment of communication, collaboration, and career development mentoring that encourages participation
in muscular dystrophy research. This goal will be coupled with outreach and communications to families and by
working with patient advocacy groups to disseminate research and clinical updates."

Summary
The In Vivo Imaging (IVI) Module is a new module that replaces the previous Multiomics
module. This module addresses increasing requests for instrument adaptations to tailor
technology to specific research needs by our faculty and we anticipate extensive usage by
multiple NEI-funded PIs. The IVI module will support research studies and projects relying on
imaging animal and human subjects. The IVI module provides state-of-the-art instruments for
imaging of the retina, lens, choroid, tumors, microcirculation, tear film and measurement of
mechanical properties of the eye in patients and animal models of ocular disease. Specific Aims
are: 1) To provide cutting edge in vivo imaging capabilities for clinical and basic science
research in patients and animal models of ocular disease using instruments that are beyond
reach of individual laboratories, 2) To provide dedicated personnel for training investigators and
staff on advanced imaging techniques and operating specialized equipment and the associated
analytic tools for in vivo image analyses, 3) To serve as a centralized resource for development
of new instrumentation, adapting existing instruments for new uses and developing custom
algorithms for image analysis. The main goal of the IVI module is that it will formally address
users’ increasing imaging needs under the leadership of a module director and with a dedicated
module manager, which will centralize imaging and analysis expertise to facilitate usage,
maintenance and scheduling, training on and ensuring availability of the instrumentation. The
IVI module will allow expanded application of imaging methods to additional researchers
through collaborations, facilitate new collaborative projects with development of new
instruments and specific adaptations of existing instruments with Department-subsidized
customizing fees, allow more consistent scheduling of the instruments and training, provides
technical expertise for grant proposals, and provides software for image processing and
analysis. Custom-built modifications to imaging instruments will be charged a fee-for-service
that includes components, raw materials, disposable supplies, equipment hire and a composite
engineering fee. The fees will be reduced for NEI R01 holders to support novel research
directions and collaborations by the Dept. Ophthalmology subsidizing 50% of the cost for IVI
(see Chair’s letter). Equipment now consolidated in the IVI module has enhanced collaborations
among NEI-funded investigators and was used to generate data that was reported in numerous
publications and included in new grant awards. The IVI module will be an essential resource
that supports highly innovative research at the forefront of translational research and allows
collaborations among basic scientists and clinical faculty at BPEI, throughout UM and in other

within this larger milieu. The respective teams of clinicians and researchers at these institutions bring
considerable scientific depth, breadth, creativity, and vision required for confronting the most challenging
problems blocking progress in our ultimate goal of reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with prostate
cancer. This SPORE proposal enlarges the blueprint for a well-built, distinctive and coordinated translational
prostate cancer research effort spanning the entire PNW.
All participating institutions have made substantial commitments toward supporting the SPORE and its
innovative, translational projects: 1) Molecular predictors of prostate cancer progression and mortality; 2)
Understanding and targeting prostate cancer lineage plasticity; 3) Modulating androgen receptor signaling to
enhance the efficacy of CAR T cell therapy for advanced prostate cancer; and 4) Clinical development of
therapeutic strategies targeting DNA repair. We also propose three Cores to support these projects: 1)
Leadership and administration; 2) Biospecimen and Pathology; and 3) Biostatistics and Bioinformatics. In
addition, we propose a Developmental Research Program and a Career Enhancement Program that will
substantially strengthen the translational goals of our prostate cancer research program and expand
opportunities for engaging young as well as established investigators in our multidisciplinary environment."
10884871,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 When bacteria invade the eye, the resulting damage is rapid and irreversible. This type of infection, called
endophthalmitis, is the most severe complication of intraocular surgery. Patient outcome is heavily dependent
on the pathogenicity of the bacteria, its susceptibility to antibiotics, and the extent of inflammation. These
factors can influence progression to the worst-case scenario, where the infected eye must be completely
removed. Even in milder cases, some amount of permanent vision loss is common. Therefore, there is need
for a treatment which targets both contributors to vision loss: bacterial growth and neurotoxic inflammation. All
bacteria require iron for survival and proliferation. During infection, they must obtain iron from host tissues. In
response, host cells will import iron to shield it from bacteria, initiating a competition for iron acquisition.
However, iron accumulation within immune cells can promote inflammation. In animal models of diverse
infections and diseases, iron chelation is both anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory. My preliminary ex vivo
data suggests that iron chelation inhibits bacterial growth in vitreous (fluid from within the eye), and that acute
iron chelation is nontoxic to the retina. Aim 1 will expand on these results to determine the effectiveness of an
iron chelator at preventing endophthalmitis in mice. I will examine the extent to which bacterial growth is
inhibited and retinal structure is preserved over time. Although reducing bacteria would naturally reduce
inflammation, the direct anti-inflammatory contribution of iron chelation would be unclear. Therefore, Aim 2 will
investigate the link between iron accumulation and retinal inflammation. Using the murine endophthalmitis
model, I will examine iron levels within retinal macrophages/microglia, and to what extent an iron chelator
reduces retinal inflammation. The result will determine the anti-inflammatory potential of iron chelation
treatment for endophthalmitis. The overall goal of this proposal is to prevent vision loss caused by bacterial
infection."

Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) are a promising immunotherapy that can be incorporated in many
strategies for the treatment and/or cure of HIV-1. There is a clear association between the neutralization
sensitivity of virus and how effective bNAbs are in suppressing virus replication during clinical trials, but the
precise nature of this relationship is still not clear. Individual clinical trials have reached different conclusions
about the utility of pre-screening participants’ virus for in vitro neutralization sensitivity before enrollment into
clinical trials mainly due to two obstacles: length of assay time and difficulty in obtaining the correct samples to
test. The Bosque lab has recently published an ultrasensitive method to detect p24 gag protein down to the fg/ml
level, and the assay was validated in ex vivo cells from PLWH. Here we will apply this novel methodology to
address these 2 obstacles by developing an assay that gives an indirect readout of neutralization sensitivity but
in a very short amount of time and directly in cell lysates. We will achieve this ultra-sensitive Env binding assay
by developing it in three parts for the first R61 phase: Aim 1 will optimize the capture and detector antibodies by
testing a matrix of bNAbs against diverse pseudoviruses with known neutralization sensitivities, Aim 2 will
optimize biological matrices by testing Env detection in plasma and cell lysates, and Aim 3 will determine assay
precision for ratios of sensitive and resistant virus in a diverse viral quasispecies. We will validate and qualify
this ultra-sensitive Env binding assay during the second R33 phase in two parts: Aim 4 will validate the assay
through post-hoc testing of well-studied clinical trial samples. Aim 5 will implement correct quality systems for
this assay to prepare for CLIA qualification. Our multi-disciplinary team has all the expertise necessary to achieve
these aims that, when completed, result in an ultra-sensitive binding assay for Env protein to screen clinical trial
participants that is time-efficient, accurate and qualified."
10903730,"ABSTRACT
 Diet is a modifiable risk factor for one of the most serious threats to global public health: cardiovascular
disease. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern is one example of a high-
quality diet that is high in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products and low in sodium, saturated fat, and
cholesterol. The DASH diet is widely recognized as an effective approach for the prevention of hypertension,
cardiovascular disease, and related cardiometabolic diseases. Existing biomarkers of dietary intake are few
and represent single nutrients rather than a holistic dietary pattern. Metabolomics and proteomics are high-
throughput methods for efficient measurement of compounds in biological specimens. The metabolome
reflects the breakdown products of food that is consumed and can represent not only food items and their
components but also dietary patterns. The proteome represents biological function and activity, which
complements the metabolomic profile. We propose to conduct untargeted metabolomics and proteomics for
the discovery of novel biomarkers of the DASH diet as well as biomarkers of DASH diet mediated blood
pressure reduction. Findings will be replicated in two independent study populations and validated by using
targeted, quantitative assays of candidate biomarkers. This cost-effective proposal leverages the existence of
study data and biospecimens in the NHBLI BioLINCC repository as well as existing omics data. The study
team is led by a K01-funded, early stage investigator who has been trained in metabolomics of diet and chronic
disease outcomes. Study team members are established, senior investigators who have a history of
collaboration with the Principal Investigator and complementary expertise in nutritional biochemistry,
untargeted metabolomics and proteomics platforms, laboratory methodology, biostatistics, dietary intake, blood
pressure, and deep knowledge of the study populations to be investigated. This proposed research will
advance the current methods for assessing dietary intake and will provide insights for clinically-important, diet-
modifiable metabolic pathways."
10863844,"Adapting to climate change requires countermeasures that can protect public mental health and community well-
being. Cities and states increasingly incorporate population health promotion into urban planning decisions, yet
the impacts of such decision decisions on mental health outcomes remain largely unstudied. With respect to
climate change cities have significant capacity to help offset the adverse effects of increasing temperatures and
enhance community resilience, through altering the design of natural and built environments. However, such
decisions require empiric evidence on the health effects of both increasing temperature and offsetting designs
to increase shade, particularly given the racial and socioeconomic inequalities in shade access. On a given day,
significant spatial variation in temperature can occur within a city or urban region, mostly driven by local
differences in shade. Temperature and shade exposure have been linked to psychopathology for centuries, with
ample biological plausibility, but few modern studies have provided comprehensive data. We propose to utilize
a cohort study of 3,396 high school students, with substantial diversity in race, income, and neighborhood,
recruited in 9th grade in 2013 in Los Angeles County, and followed up eight times with <1% attrition at each wave,
to innovatively study how intra-city differences in temperature, access to shade, and green space influence the
incidence of internalizing and externalizing symptoms and transdiagnostic psychopathological traits. We will link
geocoded residential, commuter, and school location information to remotely sensed data and local land use to
create high-resolution estimates of neighborhood surface temperatures, tree canopy cover, other built
environment sources of shade, and green space of each of the cohort participants. We will also measure
neighborhood-level factors known or hypothesized to influence psychopathology risk, including air quality,
neighborhood economic conditions, and crime. State-of-the-science confounder control strategies using multi-
dimensional g-formula mediated moderation models will generate robust associations. Through these
assessments we will construct neighborhood typologies of health risk that include social, environmental, and
physical factors. We will: 1) intensively characterize the home and school neighborhoods of >3,000 longitudinally
followed adolescents and identify transdiagnostic psychopathological symptoms and trajectories; 2) determine
the impact of neighborhood surface temperature, shaded areas, and greenspace on internalizing and
externalizing dimensions, transdiagnostic traits; and 3) construct and compare neighborhood typologies of
psychopathological risk incorporating physical and social environmental data and novel latent variable
techniques. Our research team has extensive expertise in spatial and psychiatric epidemiology and experience
in translating science to policy. This work will provide critical missing data on the effects of green infrastructure
on psychopathology among adolescents. Such data are needed to support decision-making around urban
planning, investment, and climate change mitigation to improve population health for local communities."
10904690,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and hazardous drinking (HD: heavy alcohol use and negative alcohol-
related consequences) commonly develop and co-occur following trauma exposure. The individual and public
health burden of PTSD and co-occurring HD is substantial. Although there are evidence-based behavioral
treatments for co-occurring PTSD and HD, they have limitations that result in many individuals not accessing
these treatments and limited intervention reach – i.e., existing interventions tend to be complicated,
burdensome, and require contact with an in-person therapist. Thus, there is a need to develop additional, novel
interventions that use evidenced-based strategies and that have greater portability and reach. There is a
nascent, scant literature evaluating such types of interventions for veterans, and we know of none aimed at the
general public. The current application, therefore, seeks to refine and test a brief, self-directed, intervention for
individuals from the general public with PTSD and co-occurring HD that can be delivered via text-messaging.
The proposed intervention draws on evidence-based strategies from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for
treating PTSD and co-occurring HD, and it yielded promising findings in a recent pilot study conducted by the
research team. This application seeks to refine the intervention further by testing whether theoretically-driven,
evidence-based strategies from basic cognitive psychology (message framing) and social psychology
(facilitating growth mindsets) result in better outcomes for PTSD symptoms and HD by addressing pilot
participant feedback related to avoidance and motivation. We will identify the most efficacious intervention and
test it in a fully-powered RCT. Thus, Study 1, which will recruit an adult community sample (N = 500), will test
the efficacy of enhancing the CBT text message intervention with message framing (protect against loss vs.
imagine future gains vs. no framing) and mindsets (provide growth mindset message for using skills vs. simple
reminder to use skills) via a fully-crossed 3x2 factorial design. Study 2 will build on Study 1, by conducting a
fully powered (N = 333) randomized controlled trial (RCT) that will test the comparative and long-term efficacy
of the most efficacious CBT-based text message intervention from Study 1 versus an assessment only control
in a community sample of adults with co-occurring HD and PTSD. This proposal is innovative in its approach to
adding to the menu of treatment options for co-occurring PTSD and HD and with its evaluation of the utility of
integrating basic social and cognitive psychology strategies with those from CBT. If successful, it will result in
an efficacious, novel, theory-driven, low burden behavioral intervention co-occurring PTSD and HD that is
readily scalable. Such an intervention could be implemented as a stand-alone intervention or be integrated into
stepped-care approaches, including following mass trauma exposure (natural disasters, mass casualty events,
pandemics) and thus, has the potential for a substantial impact on public health."
10873072,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Mechanistic studies of learning and memory have traditionally focused on the neuron and account for early
scientific advances in the field of neuroscience as well as the current therapeutic approach in neurology and
psychiatry. However, this perspective leaves potential therapies untapped for stubborn cognitive diseases by
neglecting the intimate relationship of glia, namely oligodendrocytes, that facilitate the memory forming actions
of neurons. Recently, myelin and the myelin producing oligodendrocyte have been shown to influence motor,
fear, and social learning through a process termed myelin plasticity. Aptly named, myelin plasticity refers to the
sculpting of myelin networks to fine tune the neuronal networks that mediate learning. Our lab has shown that
kallikrein 6 (Klk6), a secreted serine protease highly expressed by myelinating oligodendrocytes, has the
power to control oligodendrocyte differentiation as well as shape myelination patterns. Further, we find global
Klk6 knockout enhances fear memory and motor learning. Early preliminary data suggests it is the loss of Klk6
in oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPC) that drives these changes. The long-term goal of this research is to
determine the role(s) of Klk6 in adult CNS homeostasis and white matter pathology to develop new therapeutic
targets. The objective of this grant is to understand oligodendrocyte-specific mechanisms of Klk6 in fear
memory and motor learning in young adult mice. The central hypothesis to be tested is that Klk6 regulates
myelin plasticity such that reduced levels promote learning and memory by unleashing myelin synthesis. We
plan to test this hypothesis with two specific aims. Aim 1 seeks to understand if OPC Klk6 loss is sufficient to
replicate the behavioral findings in the global Klk6 knockout animals. We will characterize myelin networks in
key anatomical brain regions and study OPC dynamics with pulse labeling. Aim 2 examines the mechanistic
role of Klk6 in myelin synthesis and plasticity. First, we will generate single cell RNA sequencing data in OPC-
specific Klk6 knockout mice to determine Klk6 signaling pathways. Then we will measure the impact of Klk6
loss on the territory of myelinating oligodendrocytes as well as OPC differentiation. Finally, we will probe if Klk6
acts in tandem with discovered signaling pathways. This proposed research is innovative because it is the first
to examine Klk6 as a molecular mediator of myelin plasticity, a new and exciting branch of neuroscience
research. The proposed research is significant because we expect to expand on our fundamental knowledge of
adult myelin production, elucidate new mechanisms of memory formation, and uncover a differential impact of
Klk6 in males and females. Ultimately, this work will open new avenues for treatment of white matter pathology
in neurology and psychiatry by improving the field’s understanding of mechanisms regulating myelin
homeostasis and plasticity in the adult central nervous system."

Metabolic syndrome is on the rise as the leading cause of morbidity and mortality, affecting more than a third
of all U.S. adults. If untreated, patients who develop type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) are at high-risk for major
adverse cardiovascular events, including stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular related deaths.
Despite chronic screening and monitoring for patient-specific prediction and prevention for cardiometabolic
disease, there remains a bottleneck to detect and monitor the metabolic risk factors underlying the rising
epidemic of obesity-associated with hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes. For these reasons,
developing wearable molecular sensors, which allow for seamless screening, monitoring, and potentially
enables timely intervention, is clinically significant to confront the rising endemic of cardiometabolic disorders.
In this project, we propose to continuously monitor a panel of key metabolic biomarkers including glucose,
uric acid, branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs: leucine, isoleucine, and valine), and insulin using an
integrated Molecular Sensing System (iMSS). We hypothesize that seamless detection of cardiometabolic
biomarkers accelerates our capacity to identify metabolic risk factors in our prediabetic patients with obesity
for early nutrition intervention to reduce health disparities in the U.S. In addition to integrating with our existing
glucose and uric acid sensors, we propose to develop novel laser-engraved wearable sensors for continuous
monitoring of BCAAs and insulin based on a novel nanobiosensing approach that combines high-throughput
laser-fabricated graphene, molecular imprinting based ‘artificial antibody’, and in situ sensor regeneration
technique. This approach will enable large-scale, low-cost fabrication of highly sensitive and selective sensors
for continuous monitoring of clinical meaningful cardiometabolic analytes in human sweat at ultralow
concentrations (such as BCAAs). The use of laser-induced microfluidics and numerical simulation-guided
design optimization enables efficient fluid sampling with minimized effects from the sensing delay and fluid
evaporation. Harnessing the power of concurrent multiplexed cardiometabolic sensing, adjusted
electrochemical measurements based on pH, electrolytes, temperature, and sweat rate calibration minimize
the systematic uncertainties persisted in the current generation of wearable sensing systems. We will validate
the correlation of the sweat/blood biomarkers in healthy subjects using the iMSS and deploy these epidermal
sensors to the high-risk patients. We envision that the iMSS system will provide an entry point to identify pre-
diabetes and obesity at risk for conversion to T2D, and will have translational significance to mitigate clinical
manifestation of major adverse cardiovascular events."
10954247,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Nucleic acid therapies provide a promising pathway for the treatment of diseases that are not amenable to target-
ing by traditional small molecule drugs. Reduction in toxicity and improvements in delivery and specificity have
been achieved through covalent modifications to naturally occurring RNAs, and these advances have recently led
to the regulatory approval of several nucleic acid therapies. For example, small interfering RNA (siRNA) silences
the expression of disease-causing messenger RNAs (mRNAs). However, this strategy can cause deleterious
silencing of off-target mRNAs with partial complementarity to the siRNA guide strand. A strategy for mitigation of
off-target silencing is destabilization of base pairing in one end of the duplex by substitution of the siRNA guide
strand by glycol nucleic acid (GNA), a nucleic acid analogue with an acyclic backbone. The precise mecha-
nisms of many covalent modifications, as well as their dependence on features such as sequence position and
structural motifs, are still poorly understood. Physics-based atomistic simulations can interrogate the impact of
these modifications on the conformational ensembles of nucleic acids and expedite the trial-and-error process for
molecules that are difficult to synthesize in the laboratory. The success of such simulations relies on the accuracy
of the force field, a parameterized function that uses classical physics to estimate potential energies from atomic
coordinates. A major obstacle to the application of physics-based simulations to therapeutic nucleic acids is the
difficulty in developing accurate force field parameters for covalently modified nucleotides. This proposal aims
to advance the role of simulations in the design and mechanistic understanding of therapeutic RNAs
with covalent modifications by developing an open source workflow to derive force field parameters and
run simulations of duplex hybridization for realistic therapeutic siRNAs. In Aim 1, a force field for nucleic
acids with arbitrary covalent modifications and backbone chemistry will be parameterized using a systematic and
reproducible workflow based on open source software infrastructure maintained by the Open Force Field Initia-
tive. In Aim 2, the force field parameters will be validated against experimental measurements of duplex melting
temperatures by performing melting simulations for RNA duplexes containing substitutions of GNA. In Aim 3,
the weighted ensemble enhanced sampling method will be applied to study the duplex association process for
guide siRNAs containing GNA substitutions pairing with target and off-target mRNAs. The proposed research will
enable reliable atomistic simulations of therapeutic RNAs, expanding the available toolkit for rational design of
such therapies. The systematic workflow for developing and validating nucleic acid force field parameters will be
easily generalizable to other covalent modifications beyond those in the siRNAs studied here, facilitating similar
studies of other therapeutic platforms. This research plan will prepare the applicant for a productive indepen-
dent research career by developing technical and management skills appropriate for leadership of an academic
computational chemistry lab studying biophysical and pharmacological properties of therapeutic RNAs."
10899483,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection (HFpEF) is one of the largest unmet needs of all cardiovascular disease.
Although it now is the most common form of heart failure, to date, it has little to no specific effective therapy. An
obesity pandemic has now changed its phenotype, with obesity and metabolic syndrome now significant drivers
of the disease. We recently reported that an obese-HFpEF phenotype exhibits striking depression of right
ventricular myocyte tension generation at higher (contraction-related) levels of calcium. Critically, the mechanism
by which this occurs is unknown. Myocyte tension is regulated by both the thick filament, consisting of myosin,
and the thin filament, consisting of actin, tropomyosin, and cardiac troponins. In the thick filament, approximately
half of all myosin heads are in a conformation known as the super-relaxed (SRX) state, and the proportion of
myosin in this state is an important regulator of tension. The thin filament regulates tension by altering calcium
sensitivity, and one regulator is phosphorylation of cardiac troponin I (cTnI). In exciting new preliminary data, I
find that thick filament structure and phosphorylation of myofilament proteins are altered in obese-HFpEF. This
proposal derives from these data and aims to elucidate how obesity alters the thick and thin filament in human
HFpEF. In Aim 1, I will test the hypothesis that structural inactivation of the thick filament in obese-HFpEF results
from an excess of SRX myosin. To assess thick filament structure, I use small angle x-ray diffraction, a technique
that leverages the ordered structure of cardiac muscle to quantify distances between sarcomere proteins. This
technique is performed at the synchrotron at Argonne National Laboratory, one of few locations globally that can
perform the assay, and this proposal describes the first application of this technique to endomyocardial biopsies
from human HFpEF patients. While informative, X-ray diffraction on its own cannot prove the presence of excess
SRX myosin. For this, I will measure the myosin ATP turnover from single cardiomyocytes from HFpEF patients.
I will then explore whether obesity is a driver of excess SRX myosin by measuring both assays in HFpEF patients
with both obesity and hypertension/hypertrophy. In Aim 2, I explore the mechanism underlying how
hyperphosphorylation alters calcium activated tension. My preliminary data finds that the exposure to
enzymatically active protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) partially reverses the deficit observed in calcium activated
tension in obese HFpEF, but the mechanism is unknown. I will test if this is from thick filament activation by
measuring x-ray diffraction patterns and myosin ATP turnover after PP2A exposure. I also test if this results from
thin filament hyperphosphorylation, specifically at cTnI, in HFpEF. We have identified a novel threonine 181
residue of cTnI to be hyperphosphorylated in HFpEF, but its function is unknown. Phospho-null/mimetic
transgenic cTnI Thr181 will be swapped into skinned myocytes from HFpEF patients, and myocyte tension
measured. These studies will advance our understanding of the thick and thin filament in HFpEF and could pave
the way for new therapies with small molecule sarcomere enhancers that target these mechanisms."
10997307,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 In the United States (US), the incidence of early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC), defined as colorectal
cancer (CRC) diagnosed among individuals <50 years of age, has been increasing rapidly. Compared to late-
onset CRC (i.e., CRC diagnosed among individuals ≥50 years of age), EOCRC is characterized by more
aggressive pathology and distinct genetic profiles, indicating that the etiology of EOCRC may be distinct. There
have been a limited number of studies examining the risk factors of EOCRC, and none have focused on early
life risk factors, which could be particularly relevant to early-onset diseases. Over the past few years, the
American Cancer Society and the US Preventative Services Task Force reduced the recommended age of CRC
screening from 50 years to 45 years, and the COVID-19 pandemic influenced the provision of preventative
services across the country. These events could impact the temporal and geographic patterns of screening for
EOCRC, but no study has systematically assessed such impacts in a large sample of the US population. The
proposed study aims to 1) identify early-life risk factors of EOCRC and 2) evaluate spatiotemporal patterns of
EOCRC screening in the US. For the first aim, we will conduct a nested case-control study within the California
birth cohort and compare the birth characteristics between 1200 EOCRC cases and 60,000 control subjects
matched on year of birth. In addition, we will obtain birth address matched social, behavioral, lifestyle, and
environmental factors from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Environmental Protection
Agency and compare these neighborhood-level factors between the 1,200 cases and 60,000 controls. Two key
methodological challenges will be addressed: a) spatial autocorrelation, the tendency of adjacent geographic
units to share similar attributes; b) the modifiable areal unit problem, a biasing effect that occurs when observed
associations between exposures and outcomes vary based on the scale of the chosen geographic unit. For the
second aim, we will assess temporal patterns in EOCRC screening and identify factors associated with potential
regional variation in screening by leveraging unique claims data from Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS), the largest
insurance provider in the US that covers one-third of all Americans. Approximately 4 million beneficiaries aged
45-49 years are enrolled in BCBS each year, allowing us a great opportunity to assess both stool-based and
structural CRC screening tests. With a rigorous design and unparalleled sample sizes, the proposed study
addresses research questions with clear public health significance, is very innovative, and will probably yield a
high impact on our knowledge about the etiology and screening of EOCRC – a critically understudied field
according to the National Cancer Institute. In addition, by bringing together a multidisciplinary team of experts in
cancer epidemiology, health services research, spatial statistics, gastrointestinal oncology, and geographic
information systems science, this study will contribute to the training of a promising minority predoctoral fellow
with aspirations to pursue a career in cancer epidemiology research and improve the health status for all."

The Statistical Core, led by Drs. Gottesman and Wruck, will provide key analytic plans and completion of key
analyses, power and sample size calculations, and design of the cognitive evaluation and cognitive outcome
assessment. This core will support the DISCOVERY Network application and associated cores in the design of
the study and also for the detailed cognitive measurement that is a key component of the overall study design,
as well as in the ultimate evaluation and communication of the final study results. This Core will facilitate the
study aims, and for its cognitive assessments and classification, it will use methods previously used in the
Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, where the Core PIs Drs. Gottesman and Wruck have
previously collaborated, and which are relevant to disparity populations in the assessment of long-term cognitive
trajectories and outcomes. In addition to standard methods to consider, time-to-dementia and longitudinal
cognitive trajectory analyses, this Core will propose novel methods for predictive modeling, including the use of
machine learning and deep learning techniques. The DISCOVERY Statistics Core will: 1) develop and implement
a feasible neurocognitive battery at the DISCOVERY Network clinical sites, with repeated measurements over
at least a 2-year follow-up period; 2) conduct adjudication of cognitive events, including MCI and dementia, using
the neurocognitive battery described in Aim 1, and to perform validation of dementia classification using the
shorter battery in those participants undergoing both the shorter and more comprehensive battery; 3) contribute
statistical expertise to the design and operation of the DISCOVERY project. This will include power calculations
and sampling plans to ensure optimal representation of disparity populations and stroke subtypes for the overall
cohort and for sub-studies, semi-annual quality control checks of study data, a quality assurance plan for the
neurocognitive battery, and statistical input on OSMB reports; 4) develop an analytic strategy and perform
statistical analyses for the specific aims and sub-aims of the DISCOVERY project. Statistics core investigators
will provide methodological expertise in analysis of time-to-event endpoints (dementia, MCI); cognitive change
analyses; domain-specific performance and change analyses; and novel machine learning approaches to
predictive modeling of PSCID, incorporating neuroimaging, biomarker, “omics” and cognitive longitudinal
measurements. Through this Core, state-of-the-art cognitive measurement methods and statistical analysis
methodologies will allow unbiased consideration of cognitive outcomes in this proposed cohort of stroke patients."
10929425,"ABSTRACT (RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION CORE)
The Recruitment and Retention Core (RRC) will serve as the engine propelling successful formulation and
operation of our DISCOVERY (Determinants of Incident Stroke Cognitive Outcomes and Vascular Effects on
RecoverY) Network. Post-stroke cognitive impairment and dementia (PSCID) affects over 30-40%, leading to
devastating disability and death. Currently, a major obstacle in the field is the lack of statistically robust studies
based on patients admitted to the hospital with acute stroke, including acute ischemic stroke, intracerebral
hemorrhage, aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, and recruited to participate in systematic assessment of
early and late mechanisms of PSCID. To overcome this challenge, a large-scale scientific effort is required,
driven by a unifying hypothesis and an overarching goal to identify and characterize stroke subtypes that increase
PSCID risk and the additional clinical factors and comorbidities that contribute to or protect diverse US
populations from this devastating disability. We propose a new NINDS-funded DISCOVERY Network: a large,
multi-center national network of excellence designed to address the gap in knowledge of the clinical predictors
and biological causes of PSCID. The engine of recruitment and retention behind this project is the proposed
RRC led by a clinical trialist with proven record of success of executing multi-site, large-scale hospital-based
studies with robust stroke subtype phenotyping and post-stroke outcome assessment model. We will employ
highly developed recruitment and retention (R&R) techniques typically reserved for phase III multicenter
randomized trials to assemble large numbers of well-characterized cohorts of stroke patients. We have
assembled a team of experts in cerebrovascular clinical trials with established records of hospital-based
enrollment of acute stroke patients, as well as experts in enhancing recruitment of health disparities populations
within trials. Utilizing the vast multi-site stroke study R&R experience, RCC Core leadership, working closely with
StrokeNET and other NINDS-funded initiatives, will adapt successful and validated CREST-2 processes for site
selection and patient recruitment and retention. Further, we will develop a novel and efficient centralized phone-
based outcomes assessment hub and training modules for clinical site personnel, assuring high-quality control
and high-efficiency acquisition and transfer of clinical data, imaging and biospecimens to the DISCOVERY
Repository. The DISCOVERY RRC will establish a valuable resource for the wider scientific community, and this
new knowledge will be used to develop novel therapies to prevent cognitive impairment and promote cognitive
recovery following stroke."
10909999,"Gulf War Veterans’ Illness (GWVI) is characterized by multiple chronic symptoms including wide-spread pain
and sleep disturbances. This project will focus on brainstem structures and white matter pathways that
specifically link the hypothalamus, periaqueductal gray and locus coeruleus (along the hypothalamic-pituitary-
adrenal axis), and investigate their role in modulating pain and sleep disturbances associated with GWVI. We
hypothesize that GWVI is associated with damage of specific brainstem white matter circuits and nuclei known
to modulate pain signaling and sleep-wake cycles resulting in dysregulation of these critical functions. We
propose state-of-the-art brain imaging techniques to assess the brainstem fiber integrity and volume changes
of key brainstem nuclei and correlate these imaging measures with GWVI-related pain and sleep measures,
specifically. To test the novel hypothesis of pain modulation deficits in GWVI, we will additionally use
conditioned pain modulation (CPM) to evaluate the efficacy of descending pain modulation stimulated by a
noxious peripheral stimulus. The translation of our findings into new therapeutic trials is very probable given
that there are several novel candidate interventions that would allow the targeting of these brainstem
structures.
Our hypotheses will be tested in an observational study comparing 50 GWVI Veterans and 50 non-
symptomatic Gulf War era (GWE) Veterans. After screening, confirmation of eligibility, and consenting all
Veterans will undergo a 2-day assessment. Day 1 will comprise a battery of cognitive / functional tests and a
conditioned pain modulation (CPM) test. On Day 2, MRI exams will be performed on each patient and the
remaining cognitive/functional testing will be completed. Both visits will be no more than one week apart. This
4-year proposal will include 100 participants (2 groups of 50 each) with outcome measures collected at
appropriate time points."

uses several mechanisms to recruit these investigators including emails, letters to department chairs and web
site announcements. In addition, the Directors of the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center and the
University of Chicago Comprehensive Cancer Center advertise the CEP when recruiting junior investigators
to their respective Institutions. CEP investigators are selected after careful review of their credentials, their
proposed projects and their potential to develop an independent career in prostate cancer research. Career
Enhancement investigators are clinicians or basic scientists from biomedical science departments at
Northwestern University, University of Chicago and NorthShore University HealthSystem. The fact that the
awardees come from a variety of departments provides a source of diversity and scientific expertise to
members of the SPORE Program.
The Career Enhancement Program has flexibility in terms of offering awards and the length of the award.
However, there is a consistent and highly-structured process for solicitation and selection of CEP investigators
and a good tracking system for monitoring their progress. The specific aims of the Career Enhancement
Program are:
1. To solicit and select career enhancement investigators through a highly structured process
2. To mentor and continuously evaluate career enhancement investigators through individual meetings with

The primary goal of our training program in “Cardiovascular Biomechanics and
Imaging” is to continue attracting, training, and graduating highly qualified, multi-
disciplinary scientists in the area of cardiovascular bioengineering at pre- and
post-doctoral levels. The program was created 15 years ago in response to: 1)
the dearth of training opportunities available at the intersection between
cardiovascular medicine and bioengineering at the University of Colorado and
indeed within the Greater Rocky Mountain region; and 2) the strong institutional
commitment to build bioengineering research and training within the University of
Colorado. We believe the first 15 years have produced outstanding outcomes,
with all pre-doctoral (except one) and post-doctoral graduates of the program in
research positions within academia or industry, and many successfully receiving
research grants and trainees of their own. Further, NHLBI T32 funding has been
important in leveraging a large amount of additional funding from the University
of Colorado, which will be used to help support our next cycle of trainees. We
believe the combination of outstanding outcomes, significant and continuing
institutional support, and growing reputation continue to make a compelling
argument to continue this program."

10881997,"Project Summary
HIV infection is a chronic viral infection that if untreated leads to progressive loss of the CD4 T cell compartment
and eventually AIDS. In addition to loss of HIV-susceptible CD4 T cells, chronic HIV infection is characterized
by robust systemic immune activation including B and T cell activation and proliferation and elevated levels of
pro-inflammatory molecules. Indeed, the level of immune activation is strongly associated with HIV disease
progression. Even upon antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation and viral suppression, chronic HIV infection is
associated with dysfunctional circulating immunity rather than a return to immune quiescence. Further, immune
activation in mucosal compartments such as the gut can persist in chronically infected individuals, even with
long-term ART. This chronic immune activation during HIV infection was first identified largely through study of
men with HIV, though more recent studies have suggested that HIV-associated immune activation may manifest
differently in women. Given that women are increasingly affected by HIV, with UNAIDS reporting that 53% of
people living with HIV are women and girls as of 2020, it's evident that there is a gap in our understanding of
immune activation and dysfunction in women, particularly within the female genital tract (FGT) mucosa. A few
initial studies have suggested that immune activation is elevated in the FGT of women with HIV, and that ART
does not restore FGT immune status to homeostatic levels within the initial month of treatment. Thus, we propose
to comprehensively evaluate immune activation and dysfunction in the FGT in settings of HIV infection with or
without viral suppression for up to 24 months. In a well-characterized cohort of women with and without HIV
infection in Mombasa, Kenya, we will test two primary hypotheses: 1) We hypothesize that HIV infection leads
to increased immune activation in the FGT that persists after ART initiation and viral suppression, and 2) We
hypothesize that that chronic and persistent HIV infection leads to exhaustion of mucosal tissue T cells within
the FGT. We will advance the prior research by including a more thorough investigation of immune activation
including a focus on regulatory T cell (Treg)-mediated immunoregulatory mechanisms, and T cell exhaustion
through use of high-throughput single-cell analysis, and we will examine the effects of longer-term viral
suppression on immune activation and dysfunction in both the circulation and FGT. This will allow us to better
understand how HIV infection may lead to negative FGT health outcomes."

Parasitic diseases caused by protozoans, helminths, and arthropod-vectored infectious diseases continue
to plague much of the developing world. Even in industrialized nations, poorer communities are deeply
affected by parasitology and arthropod-vectored infectious diseases, especially in the southern Gulf Coast
region of the United States. What is needed to combat these devastating infections is a new generation of
researchers focused on parasitology and arthropod-vectored infectious diseases; however, there are only a
few NIH T32s focused on parasitology and vector-borne infectious diseases. One of these T32s is the
Parasitology and Vector Biology (PVB) Training Program at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The PVB
training program aims to attract and train the next generation of parasitology/vector biology investigators by
providing opportunities to study significant, cutting-edge research problems associated with these important
neglected tropical diseases. This goal will be accomplished by trainees acquiring a solid foundation of
advanced knowledge through coursework and seminars, and then combining this knowledge with the latest
technologies available in the laboratories of our 16 faculty trainers. Funding for this renewal is requested for
5 years to support 4 predoctoral trainees per year. After matriculating into one of three main graduate
degree programs and successfully completing the first year of graduate school, PVB trainees will be
appointed for 2 years. In addition to meeting their degree program requirements, trainees are required to
complete courses in research ethics, rigor and reproducibility, and general parasitology, as well as complete
an individual development plan, update it yearly, and present their research annually in the PVB seminar
series. In an effort to increase the diversity of graduate students seeking advanced degrees in parasitology
and vector biology, plans are described to identify and recruit under-represented minority (URM) students.
This plan has been successfully active during the last two cycles of the PVB and has increased our number
of URMs trainees in the program. Providing cutting-edge and well-rounded training in molecular
parasitology and arthropod-vectored infectious diseases for predoctoral trainees has been and will continue
to be our mission. Given the worldwide need to combat these infections, we must train the next generation
to think broadly about parasite and arthropod-vectored diseases so that novel solutions to these devastating
problems they cause can be found."

is an essential step for HK-induced inhibition of NCC. Conversely, LK-induced stimulation of Kir4.1/Kir5.1
of the DCT is an essential step for LK-induced stimulation of NCC. The mechanism by which the
basolateral Kir4.1/Kir5.1 in the DCT regulates NCC activity depends on Cl--sensitive with-no-lysine kinase
(WNK). The role of Kir4.1 and Kir5.1 in the regulation of renal K+ excretion has been demonstrated in the
mouse models: The deletion of Kir4.1 inhibits NCC activity and causes renal K+ wasting, whereas the
deletion of Kir5.1 increases NCC activity and reduces renal K+ excretion ability during HK intake. Thus,
Kir4.1 and Kir5.1 in the DCT serve as two important members of “potassium-sensor” mechanism. Although
the role of Kir4.1/Kir5.1 in regulating NCC and renal K+ excretion is well established, the regulatory
mechanism by which dietary K+ intake modulates Kir4.1 and Kir5.1 is not completely understood. We now
propose to examine the role of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORc1) and mTOR
complex 2 (mTORc2) in mediating the effect of dietary K+ intake on Kir4.1/Kir5.1 of the DCT. We
hypothesize 1) Activation of mTORc1, partially via insulin-like-growth factor 1 (IGF-1), is critically
involved in mediating LK-intake-induced stimulation of Kir4.1/Kir5.1 of the DCT and NCC; 2)
Activation of mTORc2 inhibits Kir4.1/Kir5.1 by PKC during HK and is involved in HK-intake-induced
inhibition of NCC. The proposal has three specific Aims: 1)To test the hypothesis that mTORc1 regulates
Kir4.1/Kir5.1 of DCT and NCC under control conditions (normal K+) and plays a role in determining the
baseline renal K+ excretion; 2) To test the hypothesis that activation of IGF1-mTORc1 plays a key role in
mediating LK-induced stimulation of Kir4.1/Kir5.1 in the DCT and NCC and in suppressing renal K+
excretion; 3) Test the hypothesis that Activation of mTORc2 mediates HK-induced inhibition of Kir4.1/Kir5.1
via PKC and NCC in the DCT thereby enhancing ENaC-dependent renal EK. The significance of our
proposal is to explore the novel role of mTORc1/mTORc2 pathways in mediating effects of LK or HK on
Kir4.1/Kir5.1, NCC, ENaC and ROMK in the DCT and connecting tubule."

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) maintain life-long blood production and acquire somatic mutations leading to
premalignant clonal expansion and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Eukaryotic genomes are hierarchically
organized at distinct spatial levels. However, it is largely unclear how this higher order three-dimensional (3D)
genome organization orchestrates coordinate regulation of gene expression underlying developmental fate
decisions. Nuclear lamins are structural proteins that establish genome architecture and play a prominent role
in stem cells and disease. Lamin B1 is the most abundant nuclear lamin in hematopoietic cells, and its expression
is broadly decreased in aging and due to recurrent 5q deletions in MDS. However, we lack a fundamental
understanding of how lamin B1 regulates genome organization, how this 3D organization impacts HSC fate
decisions, and whether 5q deletion of LMNB1 contributes to MDS pathogenesis and progression.
Here, we propose to systematically answer these outstanding questions to gain a fundamental understanding of
how lamin B1 contributes to normal and MDS hematopoiesis. Our team consists of a stem cell biologist with
expertise in hematologic disease modeling (Doulatov), a molecular biologist with expertise in 3D genomes
(Duan), computational biologist with expertise in 3D genomes (Noble), and a biochemist with expertise in
chromatin regulation (Escobar). In preliminary studies, we examined the molecular and functional consequences
of lamin B1 loss on human hematopoiesis. These experiments revealed that lamin B1 loss alters chromatin
organization and nuclear morphology and promotes HSC and myeloid cell fates at the expense of lymphopoiesis.
We propose to build on these preliminary studies as follows: Aim 1, Determine the role of lamin B1 and LBR in
human HSC function and clonal dynamics in vivo; Aim 2, Define how lamin B1 regulates chromatin architecture
and gene expression to control HSC fate; Aim 3, Determine whether 5q deletion of LMNB1 underlies impaired
hematopoiesis in del5q MDS. The significance of these studies is that they will elucidate how lamin-dependent
3D genome regulates HSC fate. The health relevance is that the proposed work may identify lamin B1 as a
tumor suppressor in del5q MDS. Since 5q deletion is often associated with high-risk MDS, these studies will help
identify a major genetic driver and explore therapeutic vulnerabilities for this disorder."

 GI side effects, such as ulcers and diarrhea, represent the most common source of adverse events for
pharmaceuticals. GI stem cells are responsible for repairing and replenishing GI epithelium, and pharmaceutical
inhibition of these functions likely contribute to adverse event risk. Currently there are no high-throughput and
cost-effective means of screening candidate therapeutics for effects on GI stem cells. Animal models are fraught
with confounds (e.g., rats generally do not exhibit diarrhea until death is imminent) and current in vitro models
like the Caco-2 tumor cell line do not include a normal stem cell population. While 3D-organoid cultures have a
stem cell component, access to the apical aspect of the monolayer for compound exposure is not possible
without low-throughput microinjection. Altis Biosystems, Inc. has developed a proprietary culture platform,
RepliGut® Planar, enabling primary human GI cells to form an epithelium for drug screening. In preliminary
efforts, we initiated development of a GI stem cell-specific platform called RepliGut® StemScreen to address the
unmet need for high-throughput, cost-effective GI stem cell screening, including a range of assays to measure
properties that might lead to adverse events. These included assays related to stem cell proliferation, self-
renewal, and differentiation competency.
 In our Phase 1 studies, we developed a 5 day, 96-well, plate-based screening assay (termed StemTox)
and tested a panel of pharmaceutical agents known to trigger GI side effects. The results revealed a highly
sensitive and dose-dependent inhibition of stem cell proliferation and impairment of intestinal barrier formation.
Furthermore, our assay detected “adverse” concentrations for compounds that closely paralleled the clinical
plasma Cmax associated with human clinical outcomes. In this Phase 2 application, we propose to complete
optimization of the StemTox screen, generate a commercial validation data set (using multiple tissue donors and
cell lots of transverse colon), and expand the model to integrate cell differentiation and long-term drug exposures.
Collectively, this work will result in the commercial launch of the StemTox assay, as well as, enable several
follow-on experimental paradigms to more comprehensively assess off-target drug mechanisms and repeat-
dosing experiments (to parallel current IND-enabling nonclinical study requirements)."

NLRC4 is a member of the Nucleotide-Binding Domain and Leucine-Rich Repeat Receptor (NLR) family of
cytosolic pattern recognition receptors and is primarily expressed in innate immune cells. The canonical NLRC4
pathway is activated following the recognition of components of Gram-negative bacteria by NAIP proteins
resulting in NLRC4 oligomerization and assembly of the inflammasome complex. Activation of the NLRC4
inflammasome culminates in caspase-1-mediated processing and release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-
1. We have found that NLRC4 plays a protective role in mice challenged subcutaneously with either B16F10
melanoma cells or in a model of influenza A virus infection. In both models, Nlrc4-deficient (Nlrc4-/-) mice had a
loss of effector CD4+ T cells. Generation and maintenance of robust T cell responses relies on T cell interactions
with antigen presenting cells. Evaluation of Nlrc4-/- macrophages and dendritic cells (DC) revealed a
downregulation of AKT1 and FoxO3a phosphorylation, which in turn resulted in the upregulation of the apoptosis-
inducing ligand FasL on Nlrc4-/- myeloid cells that triggered cell death in co-cultured T cells. Importantly, unlike
the canonical NLRC4 pathway, the anti-tumor and anti-viral roles of NLRC4 were inflammasome-independent,
suggesting a novel non-canonical NLRC4 signaling pathway. In this proposal we will expand on these novel
findings and utilize innovate technologies to probe unanswered questions. We hypothesize that endogenous
danger signals activate NLRC4 in myeloid cell, which in turn maintains effector T cell responses by preventing
FasL upregulation. We will define the mechanism by which NLRC4 is activated in antigen presenting cells and
the novel non-canonical pathway through which NLRC4 modifies subsequent T cell responses. We will also
determine what factors downregulate NLRC4 expression and how this downregulation can be exploited by
pathogens and tumors. These studies will identify novel pathways in innate immune cells that can be targeted to
either augment specific anti-tumor or anti-viral responses or inhibit pathogenic T cell responses."

 Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) typically starts in childhood, leads to lifelong morbidity, and
costs the economy $2.1 billion (direct costs) and $6.2 billion (indirect costs such as lost productivity) annually.
OCD often responds inadequately to serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs). Moreover, the typical SRI response
is only partial and is delayed by 2-3 months. Given the dysfunction OCD imposes on millions of U.S. adults,
exploring whether SRI non-responders are helped by adding drugs with different mechanisms of action is
urgently needed. Emerging data support ketamine’s rapid and sustained anti-obsessional effects in OCD. We
seek to understand the mechanisms underlying ketamine’s rapid OCD effect and thereby to speed
development of more effective agents for OCD.
 For several reasons, this proposal focuses on ketamine’s action on the mu-opioid system and OCD
neural circuits. First, our prior work found that the mu-opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone blocks ketamine’s
acute, dramatic antidepressant effects. Second, naltrexone also worsens OCD symptoms, while morphine (a
mu-opioid receptor agonist) diminishes OCD symptoms. Third, in major depression, attempts to develop follow-
on agents that work via NMDA antagonism have not been successful. One possible explanation is that NMDA
antagonism may not fully explain ketamine’s rapid and enduring antidepressant effects. To assess the neural
targets modulated by mu-opioid receptor antagonism, we focus on fronto-striatal cognitive control circuits
which neuroimaging studies show are directly influenced by the mu-opioid system. Indeed, mu-opioid receptors
are distributed throughout the fronto-striatal circuits associated with OCD. Drawing on this rationale, the
proposed mechanistic trial would be the first to probe the role of ketamine’s opioid properties in modulating
fronto-striatal circuitry and bringing about anti-obsessional effects in OCD.
 We will test, by administering pre-treatment with naltrexone, whether opioid receptor antagonism blocks
ketamine’s effects on control and reward circuits and circuit connectivity. Low-cost markers of opioid system
engagement that predict anti-obsessional response are needed. We will therefore explore two promising, low-
cost markers of opioid system engagement in humans. The proposed projects combine experimental
medication and neuroimaging approaches in order to open a new avenue for therapeutics to transform
psychiatric treatments."

10890041,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Immune systems across kingdoms of life recognize pathogen-associated molecules through germline-encoded
innate immune receptors. Receptor repertoires in plants have evolved to detect an especially diverse set of
ligands due to massive expansion of the receptor kinase gene family with specialized ligand recognition
functions. Pairing receptor sequence diversity with specific recognition functions across 100 million RK genes
(350,000 plant species * 500 receptors per genome) is a grand challenge in plant molecular biology. It also
presents the opportunity to develop a new class of protein-based sensors for biotechnology. The Steinbrenner
lab aims to characterize and deploy this vast plant immunodiversity for ligand-induced modulation of
engineered signaling pathways.
First, we will define the full ligand space that is monitored by plant receptors by focusing on the large subfamily
of leucine-rich repeat receptor kinases (termed receptors here) which bind small peptide epitopes to initiate
immune signaling. We will combine evolution- and structure-guided approaches to decode the basis of
receptor:ligand specificity, including an extensive phylogenomic analysis, peptide variant libraries, and
ancestral sequence reconstruction. We hypothesize that transitions in ligand specificity are marked by amino
acid substitutions in predicted ligand binding sites among ancestral receptor genes. For “orphan” receptors
lacking defined functions, we will conduct a genomic screen using synthetic DNA libraries encoding candidate
pathogen epitopes using both plant and yeast models as reporters for receptor activation. We hypothesize that
most receptors involved in plant innate immunity will be activated by specific pathogen-derived peptide
sequences. Combined, these approaches will provide basic insights into receptor:ligand specificity as well as a
toolkit of extracellular sensor domains responsive to specific peptide agonists.
Second, we will leverage the unique network architecture of plant immune networks to engineer synthetic
signaling pathways that do not interfere with endogenous animal signaling pathways. The plant receptors
studied here signal through heterodimerization with a common co-receptor called BAK1. Co-receptor activation
culminates in phosphorylation of substrates based on defined phosphocode motifs. We are currently
engineering the human inflammation signaling pathway to accept orthogonal input from plant receptors by
incorporating plant kinase substrates into specific, phosphoregulated signaling factors. In parallel, we will use
plant receptor:co-receptor heterodimerization as a platform to scaffold endogenous human immune signaling
domains from Toll-like receptors. We hypothesize that engineered pathways will allow modular tuning by
diverse peptide ligands, providing an alternative to current immunoglobulin or GPCR-based synthetic tools. In
summary our lab is poised to deploy tools for receptor de-orphanization and signaling pathway engineering to
leverage the immense diversity driven by plant-pathogen co-evolution. (30 lines)"
10833213,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Prescription opioid therapy plays a critical role in the clinical management of pain in multiple acute and chronic
settings. The challenges of effective pain management have led to over 2 million adults in the US, and over 12
million globally, with an opioid use disorder (OUD). OUD accounts for over 120,000 deaths annually worldwide.
The dominant target of therapeutic opioids is the µ-opioid receptor (MOR). The analgesic effects of MOR
agonists are due to Gα,i/o/z-protein signaling, and it has been proposed that undesirable side-effects of MOR
agonists, such as respiratory depression and tolerance, can be mitigated through partial recruitment of Gi/o/z-
protein subtypes. Thus, it is of clinical interest to determine the relationship between MOR signaling and
analgesia versus side-effects to guide the design of therapeutic agonists that selectively activate the desired
signaling pathway. G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), including MOR, are known to adopt a range of
different functionally distinct configurations upon engaging orthosteric modulators and/or intracellular effector
proteins. These induced-fit structural rearrangements cannot be modeled with existing computer-aided drug
discovery algorithms during docking or design due to the time and resources required.
It is the objective of this proposal to develop a customizable, multi-purpose computer-aided drug
design (CADD) platform that can efficiently model largescale induced-fit conformational changes
during small molecule and/or receptor sequence design. Completion of the proposal will enable structure-
based design of biased agonists and DREADDs (Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer
Drugs). This proposal will include innovative algorithms that leverage deep learning protein structure prediction
methods and ultra-large make-on-demand chemical libraries to rapidly screen synthetically accessible
molecules for those that can induce conformational changes required to activate G¬i¬-protein signaling in
MOR. In collaboration, I will synthesize (Dr. Craig Lindsley), functionally validate (Drs. Craig Lindsley, Heidi
Hamm, and Vsevolod Gurevich), and structurally characterize (Drs. Beili Wu and Matthias Elgeti) designed
molecules and DREADDs. Experimentally validated partial and biased agonists and DREADDs will be fed back
into the computational platform to be used as starting points for subsequent rounds of optimization. In this way,
we will establish a computational-experimental iterative feedback loop."
10930049,"Myc proteins are essential for normal cellular growth and proliferation. However, when its normal regulation
is compromised (i.e. deregulated) Myc promotes initiation and progression of a broad spectrum of human
cancers. Myc has been long known to be a transcription factor that heterodimerizes with the Max protein in
order to specifically recognize DNA. When deregulated, Myc-Max alters gene expression programs resulting
in metabolic and growth related changes that in turn support tumor progression. Recent studies show Myc-
Max does not function alone, but is part of a larger transcriptional “network” of related, yet functionally dis-
tinct, factors that heterodimerize with either Max or the Max-like protein MLX, or both. In order to understand
and control Myc's role in the etiology of cancer it will be essential to define how Myc both depends on and
influences the extended network. This application builds on 3 broad aspects of our ongoing studies:
Transcriptional reprogramming of metabolism: We had earlier uncovered a critical role for Mlx, and its hetero-
dimeric partner MondoA, in the metabolism and survival of several Myc-driven tumors. Focusing on pancre-
atic adenocarcinoma we will examine cross-talk and functional dependencies involving Myc in the context of
its extended network that may be exploited to identify new therapeutic strategies. Moreover, Myc and the
other network proteins are transcription factors and we will determine their shared target genes and their co-
operative effects on chromatin modifications and higher order structure as well as gene expression.
Tumor suppression mediated by Mga, a member of the Myc Network: Mga is a large and unusual transcrip-
tion factor with two distinct DNA binding domains, one of which dimerizes with Max, binds DNA, and is fre-
quently subject to deletion or mutation in a wide range of neoplasms. However, little is known about Mga's
oncogenic functions. Our very recent findings that Mga loss of function results in altered cell motility in vitro,
and rapid lung adenocarcinoma formation in mice provide a biological system to elucidate Mga's capacity to
suppress cancer. We will define regions in Mga essential for DNA binding, identify transcriptional complexes
associated with Mga, and assess how loss of Mga leads to tumor initiation, progression and metastasis.
Molecular alterations driving Myc oncogenicity: we introduced a point mutation (T58A), associated with B cell
lymphomas and AML, within the phosphodegron of the endogenous murine myc gene. In these mice, Myc-
T58A is regulated normally with no overt changes in tissue growth or proliferation. Yet we find that myc-T58A
mice display increased hematopoietic progenitor cell self-renewal and resistance to apoptosis, and develop
long-latency AML or lymphoma. Our data show that the Myc-T58A mutation alters the association of Myc
with a specific co-regulatory complex. We hypothesize that this altered binding modifies expression of a sub-
population of Myc target genes during hematopoiesis, resulting in production of tumor initiating cells. We plan
to elucidate the underlying molecular basis for the T58A phenotype in these tumor-prone mice."
11070285,"RBC alloimmunization occurs when patients make antibodies to foreign antigens expressed on allogenic donor
RBCs, and remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality among chronically transfused patients.
Though the vast majority of RBC transfusions express foreign antigens, only a subset of transfused patients
will make alloantibodies. Indeed, patients tend to stratify into those who make multiple alloantibodies
(responders) and those who never make an alloantibody despite multiple transfusions (non-responders).
However, the molecular factors that regulate responder vs. non-responder status are poorly defined. RBCs
have long been known to secrete of ATP and regulate endothelial cell function via resultant purinergic
signaling, but the impact of purinergic signaling on RBC alloimmunization has not been previously addressed.
We hypothesize that RBC driven purinergic signaling tends to suppress the antibody response to transfused
RBCs, and further that inherent differences in purinergic signaling sensitivities among patients can impact their
responder status. Using a mouse model of RBC alloimmunization, our preliminary data demonstrate that
multiple different steps in the purinergic signaling pathway (P2X7R, CD73, and ADORA2b) do indeed regulate
anti-RBC alloantibody production. This proposal sets out to determine the exact cellular and molecular
mechanisms by which purinergic signaling regulates RBC alloimmunization, and further determine whether the
known gain and loss of function polymorphisms of purinergic receptors can dictate whether a given patient will
make anti-RBC IgG alloantibodies. Specifically, Aim1 of our proposal will test the hypothesis that B cell binding
to transfused RBCs induces PANX1 mediated ATP secretion, and this extracellular ATP drives P2X7R
activation. We further hypothesize that P2X7R activation suppresses IgG class-switching and germinal center
formation by inducing ectodomain shedding of key B cell surface proteins. Aim2 of our proposal will test the
hypothesis that CD73 expression on B cells regulates the balance of AMP and Adenosine signaling on
responding B cells, ultimately altering B cells responses by regulating intracellular cyclic-AMP signaling.
Finally, Aim3 of this proposal will test the hypothesis that known polymorphisms in the P2X7R, ADORA1 and
ADORA2b genes can account for some of the phenotypic differences observed among responder and non-
responder patient populations. Synergy between projects comes from crosstalk between our focus on
purinergic signaling and (a) the known interactions between P2X7R signaling and immune complex signaling
through TLR7 and TLR9 (Project 1), (b) the fact that P2X7R is highly expresses on RBC precursors but
decreases as RBCs mature (Project 3), and (c) the known enhancement of soluble CD73 and increased levels
of ATP, ADP, AMP and Adenosine in patients with sickle cell disease (Project 4)."
11070286,"Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is the most common therapeutic modality given to patients in America, with
approximately 1 out of every 70 Americans being transfused each year. Although RBC transfusions save lives,
some patients develop alloantibodies against donor RBC blood group antigens. Clinically significant
alloantibodies have adverse effects in transfusion, pregnancy, and transplant settings. There are very few
effective therapeutic interventions to prevent RBC alloimmunization, in general, and/or to eliminate
alloantibodies in already sensitized patients. Thus, there is an unmet clinical need to understand the risk
factors that can identify (1) which RBC units are immunogenic and (2) which patients are at high risk for
alloimmunization; this knowledge will lead to novel strategies to prevent and/or alleviate these adverse events.
 Alloimmunization risk may be impacted by (1) the donor RBC unit and (2) the transfusion recipient’s immune
system. Observationally, higher reticulocyte counts are observed in RBC units from repeat blood donors
because compensatory reticulocytosis lasts longer than the interval between donations. Additionally,
transfusion recipients at highest risk of alloimmunization also have ongoing reticulocytosis (e.g., patients with
hemolytic anemias). Thus, we generated tractable murine models to test the hypothesis that reticulocytes
modulate alloimmunization rates. Herein, we provide robust preliminary data that identify reticulocytes as a
significant risk factor for RBC alloimmunization at both the donor and recipient levels: higher alloimmunization
rates/alloantibody levels are seen upon transfusion of RBC donor units containing high reticulocyte counts as
well as upon allogeneic RBC transfusion into recipients exhibiting reticulocytosis. Because reticulocytes differ
from mature RBCs (e.g., reticulocytes have mitochondria), we hypothesize that reticulocytes contain and/or
express ligands that activate immune cells and initiate alloimmune responses. We use both pre-clinical models
and samples from humans to elucidate the mechanisms underlying reticulocyte-mediated enhanced
alloimmunization. To that end, we developed 4 murine models to study reticulocytes that reflect human settings
(e.g., hemolytic anemia, repetitive phlebotomy) as different types of stress erythropoiesis may result in
reticulocyte differences. To elucidate how reticulocytes enhance alloantibodies, we will leverage sophisticated
methods to identify, track, and measure immune responses to reticulocytes in an RBC unit and/or upon their
induction in a transfusion recipient. To translate our findings to humans, we will also study how reticulocytes
modulate the function of B cells collected from patients with reticulocytosis (e.g., hemolytic anemia) as
compared to healthy controls. Elucidating how reticulocytes enhance alloimmunization will (1) aid in identifying
potentially immunogenic donor RBC units and (2) predict which transfusion recipients are at higher risk of
developing alloantibodies; together these will prevent future alloimmunization events. Additionally, this
knowledge will provide insights into potential therapeutic targets to prevent and/or treat alloimmunization."

11136621,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Up to 40% of critically injured trauma patients will develop a serious infectious complication during their inpatient
hospitalization and respiratory infections are the most common cause of sepsis in injured patients. While it is known
that traumatic injury triggers a sterile inflammatory response that can result in acute lung injury (ALI), the mechanism of
this and its contribution to the development of secondary infections such as pneumonia is not well understood. The
overarching goal of this research is to understand the role of the innate immune system in trauma induced lung injury in
order to provide new targets for treatment and prevention. We have recently established a mouse model of polytrauma
that recapitulates the increased susceptibility to gram negative pneumonia seen in critically injured patients. In
preliminary studies, we demonstrate that trauma alone induces both an acute lung injury and increased susceptibility to
Pseduomonas pneumonia. We further find an increase in neutrophil NETosis following a second insult with
pseudomonas bacteria. Neutrophil NETosis is a strong antimicrobial neutrophil response whereby activated neutrophils
extrude a web of DNA studded with cytotoxic granules which function to immobilize and kill invading pathogens. While
NETosis is a critical anti-infective pathway, excessive NETosis has been demonstrated to result in collateral damage to
host tissues. We also show that serum from traumatically injured mice can prime unactivated neutrophils for NETosis.
Based on these data we hypothesize that trauma primes neutrophils for NETosis causing ALI and an overexuberant
response to gram negative bacterial pneumonia after trauma. To test this hypothesis we propose two specific aims.
Aim 1: Determine if neutrophil NETosis triggered by polytrauma-induced ALI exacerbates pneumonia.
Aim 2: Define the the role of GCSF in promoting NETosis after polytrauma
AIM3: Define the contribution of neutrophil NETosis to the dysregulated immune response induced by a secondary
infection after trauma.
The knowledge gained from successfully achieving these aims will provide a novel pathway to prevent and treat ALI after
trauma and are clinically translatable as several current FDA approved therapeutics are known to have activity against
key enzymes required for NETosis and multiple specific therapeutics are currently being developed. This knowledge is
crucial so that Dr. Leonard’s laboratory can translate these to development of mechanistic therapies that may improve
patient outcomes."
10896000,"Project Abstract
ADHD is one of the most common childhood disorders and often persists into adolescence—a period in which
many individuals get licensed to drive. The ability to drive is important to an individual's participation in modern
society, as it enhances independence and social and economic opportunity. However, motor vehicle crashes
are the leading cause of death among teens. Skills that are critical in driving, including executive functioning, are
frequently impaired in individuals with ADHD. Thus, research is critically needed to establish the scientific foun-
dation for driving risks among teens with ADHD so that evidence-based countermeasures to reduce crash risk
can be developed. Our initial R01 project established that the risk of crash involvement for newly licensed teen
drivers with ADHD is 30%-40% higher than same-aged drivers without ADHD (Curry 2017 and 2019). This R01
renewal directly addresses the next logical critical gap: understanding why crash risk is elevated for teen drivers
with ADHD. Our overall objective is to identify specific factors that heighten driving risks for teen drivers with
ADHD. We will accomplish this with three specific aims. In Aim 1 we will identify distal factors (outside vehicle
environment) that heighten risk of adverse driving outcomes for teens with ADHD. In Aim 2 we will identify prox-
imal factors (within vehicle environment) that heighten risk. Finally, in Aim 3 we will examine (among drivers with
ADHD) the association between ADHD-related factors—including medication use, current ADHD impairment,
and the presence of co-occurringdisruptivebehavioral disorder—andadversedriving outcomes. To achieveAim
1, we will conduct a prospective cohort study of 1,000 teen-parent dyads (500 with ADHD, 500 without ADHD).
Participants will complete a baseline and four wave surveys that span from the learner phase through the first
15 months of independent driving. Survey data will be linked to objective driving outcomes captured via a
smartphone data logger and existing state-level administrative data on moving violations and crashes. To
achieve Aims 2 and 3, we will conduct a naturalistic driving study that will include 90 teens from Study 1 as they
obtain an intermediate license (10 without ADHD, 40 with ADHD and prescribed ADHD medication, 40 with
ADHD and not prescribed ADHD medication). Innovative in-vehicle technology in teens' vehicles will continu-
ously monitor driving patterns, behaviors, and performance for the first 12 months of licensure. We will also
collect daily medication use for the first 3 months of licensure utilizing innovative ecological momentary assess-
ment methods via text prompts. This will enable us to conduct the first examination of how ADHD medication
use influences real-world naturalistic driving performance. We expect that the rich foundational information gen-
erated from this project will provide critical knowledge about driving risks for teens with ADHD. The project will
make a positive impact in that it will enable us to begin addressing the pressing need for targeted interventions
for teens with ADHD and their families during the learning-to-drive period—ultimately optimizing their safety as
independent drivers."
10802329,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The colon is a responsive tissue, and the epithelium replaces itself every 3-4 days. The colon has dedicated
stem cells that divide for self-renewal and differentiation into specialized cell types. Differentiated colon cells
perform distinct functions including water absorption and mucus secretion. In many tissues, differentiation is
driven by epigenetic mechanisms including histone modifications. Methylation of histone H3 at lysine 36 (H3K36)
is associated with gene bodies at sites of transcriptional activity. H3K36 methylation contributes to differentiation
and stem cell maintenance in rapidly renewing tissues including blood and testes. Based on preliminary data, I
hypothesize that H3K36 methylation governs cell fate decisions and reinforces cell identity in colon epithelial
cells, specifically colonocyte and goblet cell lineages. To address this hypothesis, I will pursue two specific aims.
First, I plan to characterize the H3K36 methylation signature in colon epithelial cells. Second, I will determine the
functional role of H3K36 methylation in colon cell identity. Although, establishing a direct connection between
specific histone modifications and cellular processes is challenging due to redundancies in the system, I can
overcome this obstacle by taking advantage of a lysine (K)-to-methionine (M) mutation first discovered in cancer
patients to precisely suppress H3K36 methylation. I will combine multiple cutting-edge tools to specifically trace
and manipulate H3K36 methylation in mice and organoid model systems to advance the understanding of
chromatin and lineage specification in the colon. I will also utilize novel sorting protocols to purify distinct colon
cell populations for comparative epigenetic and transcriptional analysis. Collectively, this work is significant
because it will establish the role of H3K36 methylation in controlling cell-type specific gene expression and
lineage decisions in the colon. Revealing the role histone modifications play in colon homeostasis is the first step
to understanding how these regulatory mechanisms break down in diseases such as colitis/cancer and could
impact human health."
10836559,"In response to RFA-AI22-024 Limited Interaction Targeted Epidemiology: Viral Suppression
(LITE-VS), we propose “Exploring, Predicting, and Intervening on Long-term Viral suppression
Electronically (EPI-LoVE)” with a cross-cutting, interdisciplinary scientific team with strong
expertise in longitudinal cohorts to enroll a large, digitally maintained cohort of people living with
HIV (PLWH) in the US who are not adequately virally suppressed (>200 copies/mL), report prior
gaps in HIV care engagement, or lack of sustained viral suppression (VS). The cohort will
investigate trajectories of HIV care engagement and VS applying a theoretical approach and
analytic strategies that recognize the cyclical nature of retention in HIV care and VS. We will
examine the syndemics underlying these outcomes including substance use, mental health, and
barriers to HIV care including stigma and rural isolation. Our strategy includes multiple recruitment
methods such as a) social media recruitment in partnership with digital advertising companies
employing unique tools, websites/apps and artificial intelligence (AI)-based models to optimize
outreach/recruitment; and b) a partnership with AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF), the largest
HIV medical provider in the country. We will enroll a diverse cohort of PLWH enriched with those
living in rural areas, Black, under 25 years of age and experiencing substance use challenges.
An evidence-based digital platform (HealthMpowerment, HMP) deployed in 10 studies, including
other limited interaction targeted epidemiology (LITE) initiatives, will be used for data collection,
real-time analysis and participant communication and will be supplemented with semi-annual
blood specimens collected with a multi-pronged strategy (i.e. local laboratory, clinics, and home-
based collection options) to facilitate participation. We will develop a sophisticated risk
assessment tool to optimize when PLWH in our cohort are most at risk for VNS and deliver
tailored, real-time intervention components based on their personalized needs at the time they
need them most. Our investigative team from three leading institutions The University of California
at Los Angeles and Irvine, and University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill has decades of
experience with recruitment, engagement, and care of PLHW and large-scale longitudinal cohort
studies, as well as long-standing expertise developing digital and AI-based tools in collaboration
with HIV stakeholders. We capitalize upon productive partnerships and expertise to articulate the
drivers of the ongoing HIV epidemic among the most vulnerable populations in the US and to
identify the most effective, expeditious and scalable digital strategies to address this ongoing
public health crisis."
10907514,"Mechanisms of microvascular endothelial cell injury caused by extracellular histones
Abstract
Despite the recent progress towards understanding of the basis of increased vascular permeability and
inflammation caused by circulating vasoactive peptides, lipids, and exogenous agents (bacteria, toxins,
particulate matter), the impact of intracellular compounds released by injured tissues and known as danger-
associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) on severity of ongoing acute respiratory syndrome caused by sepsis
or traumatic injury remain poorly understood, and molecular mechanisms underlying deleterious effects of
DAMPs warrant further investigations. This translational study will investigate effects of nucleus-associated
DAMPs, histones, on vascular endothelial function and test a new hypothetical mechanism by which circulating
histones target lung microvascular endothelium and worsen lung injury. The central hypothesis tested in this
application is that circulating histones elevated during acute lung injury, sepsis, trauma, severe inflammation,
or major surgery target vascular endothelium and contribute to overall vascular dysfunction, organ damage and
mortality. This may be achieved through: 1) histone-induced engagement of scavenger receptor cluster of
differentiation 36 (CD36) leading to propagation of endothelial inflammation and barrier dysfunction; and 2)
CD36-induced activation of death signaling by circulating histones contributing to augmentation of ongoing
endothelial dysfunction and lung injury. The proposed study may have a broader impact on the other aspects
of vascular responses to inflammatory or pro-angiogenic stimuli. Proposed studies will provide mechanistic
insights offering better understanding of factors that define severity of sepsis and trauma. These studies may
lead to identification of molecular targets and developing new therapeutic approaches to mitigate such
deleterious effects of circulating DAMPs."
10830924,"PROJECT SUMMARY The number of people over age 65 has more than tripled over the past century, placing
great burdens on families and the healthcare system. Extending healthspan, the portion of the life that is relatively
free from major deficits that impair quality of life, may be the most efficacious way to prevent or delay aging and age-
related diseases to reduce such burdens. However, without fully understanding the mechanisms driving aging,
identifying and developing effective and translatable interventions to improve health and longevity in humans will
likely remain limited.
 A hallmark of aging, cellular senescence (CS), is an apoptotic-resistant, cell-cycle arrested state induced by
various stressors. Senescent cells release pro-inflammatory soluble factors collectively called the senescence-
associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which can induce premature CS in healthy cells and promote age-related
pathologies. CS can be cleared by genetic or pharmacological (i.e., senolytic drugs) methods, which leads to
improvements in metabolic health and reductions age-related diseases.
 Protein restriction (PR) improves many aspects of metabolic health in both humans and mice, and extends
mouse lifespan, specifically through the reduced consumption of the branched-chain amino acids (i.e. leucine,
isoleucine and valine; BCAAs). In preliminary studies, I have found that a diet low in BCAAs (BCAA-R) reduces CS
in aged and diet-induced obese mice as well as cell culture. The mechanisms by which protein promotes CS, and
conversely the mechanisms by which PR and BCAA-R promote healthy aging and reduce CS, are unknown.
 One mechanism by which BCAA-R may function to reduce CS is the protein kinase mTORC1, which is
stimulated by protein and BCAAs. mTORC1 activity promotes the SASP, while the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin inhibits
the SASP. BCAA-R has been shown to reduce mTORC1 signaling in the liver and muscle of male mice. Another
factor required for PR is fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), which is also induced by BCAA-R. In vitro, FGF21 has
been shown to protect against CS burden. In this proposal, I will test if diet affects CS clearance by assessing if
senolytics will have the greatest effect on metabolic health and frailty in aged mice eating a high protein diet. I also
will test if BCAAs drive high-protein-induced CS and metabolic dysfunction through activation of mTORC1 in vivo and
in vitro. Finally, I will test if the action of BCAA-R on FGF21 in the whole body or in specific tissues mediates the
effects of a BCAA-R on metabolic health and CS in diet-induced obese mice.
 Together, these aims will examine multiple mechanisms by which dietary protein and the BCAAs modulate to
impact CS burden. I will be completing this fellowship under the mentorship of my sponsor, Dr. Dudley Lamming, an
expert in aging biology and metabolism, and my co-sponsor, Dr. Paul Robbins, a world-leading expert in CS.
Completing these aims and the accompanying individualized training plan will help me develop the skills necessary
to become a successful tenure track faculty member focused on the biology of aging and cellular senescence."
10938611,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The retina is comprised of neural circuit ensembles that communicate through connections called synapses to
generate visual perception and behavior. Retinal diseases cause signaling deficits that derail this communication
and block information flow traveling from the retina to the brain. Severe congenital stationary night blindness is
of particular interest because despite complete suppression of signal transmission through the on retinal pathway
that signals light increments, the on neural circuitry is anatomically intact. Alpha ganglion cells, the primary output
neurons of retinal pathways that code for specific visual features, receive excitatory and inhibitory synaptic
inputs, integrate these inputs across their dendritic compartments, and generate and transmit trains of action
potentials to the brain. We know that neural circuits can adopt diverse strategies to conduct precise synaptic
computations and generate response properties, however, the cellular and synaptic factors prone to alteration
during retinal diseases are not well understood.
This proposal seeks to address important unanswered questions about the mechanisms of neural compensation
that occur in response to specific signaling deficits in well-defined alpha retinal output circuits. Using a set of
neurophysiological and anatomical approaches, these experiments will define how intrinsic properties and
synaptic computations of alpha retinal ganglion cells are altered when the synaptic inputs and balance of
excitation/inhibition that a neuron receives is perturbed. Two CRISPR-edited knockout models of the principal
glutamate receptor of the on retinal pathway, mGluR6, will be used to study neural compensation in the inner
retina across homozygous (100% block) and heterozygous (50% block) conditions. We will correlate single cell
electrophysiology with high resolution imaging and visual behavior assays to complement observations across
the cellular, synaptic, and behavioral levels. Together, the proposed experiments stand to significantly deepen
our mechanistic understanding of the substrates of neural compensation in the inner retina and define the cellular
and synaptic deficits of severe congenital stationary night blindness."
10856903,"Project Summary
The human intestine is colonized by a diverse array of almost 100 trillion bacteria that are critical for health.
Intestinal mucus is the critical interface between the host and the gut microbiome; it is a barrier between
humans and pathogenic microbes, and it is also an attractant for beneficial microbes, supporting vital
commensal microbes with nutrients and attachment sites. The main components of intestinal mucus are highly
O-glycosylated mucins and other glycoproteins. Inflammatory bowel diseases, such as ulcerative colitis and
Crohn’s, are characterized by gut inflammation that results in dysbiosis of the microbiome and alterations in
intestinal mucus glycan structures. The molecular structure of mucus has functional significance. Fucosylation
is abundant in mammalian intestinal mucus, and it has been shown to regulate commensal microbe
colonization and maintain host-microbe symbiosis. Additionally, fucosylation has been shown to alter the
quality and quantity of intestinal mucus in ulcerative colitis patients. Mucin sulfation has also been implicated in
ulcerative colitis. β1-3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 7 (B3GNT7) is an O-glycosyltransferase present on
the Golgi apparatus membrane that transfers GlcNAc to glycan substrates and participates in polyLacNAc
chain biosynthesis. Importantly, these polyLacNAc chains can go on to be further modified by fucose and/or
sulfate. We previously reported that that IL-22, a cytokine critical for maintaining intestinal epithelial
homeostasis, promotes B3GNT7 expression, increases fucosylated O-glycans, and increases polyLacNAc
chains on a model of the human intestinal epithelium. Furthermore, we found that overexpression of B3GNT7
is sufficient to increase cell surface fucosylation. The research outlined in this proposal that B3GNT7 functions
to maintain healthy intestinal mucus and support beneficial commensal gut microbes. This proposal will 1)
Define the impact of B3GNT7 on the biophysical properties of intestinal mucus in cell lines and mice; and 2)
Determine the effect of B3gnt7 expression on host-microbiome interactions. Regulation of intestinal mucus and
the microbiome is poorly understood, and the experiments outline above will elucidate how changes in
glycosylation regulate the microbiome at the molecular and tissue level. Importantly, it will lay the foundation
for future studies of how glycosylation of intestinal mucus contributes to both human health and disease."
10861733,"ABSTRACT
Proper physiological development relies on cell-to-cell communication via secreted morphogens. These
potent signaling molecules signal at both short and long range in temporal- and tissue-specific manners
to determine cell fate and pattern tissues. Sonic Hedgehog (SHH), a well-studied vertebrate
morphogen, plays an integral role in a variety of developmental processes including neural tube
patterning and limb development. Defects in the pathway result in developmental malformations, while
aberrant activation has been associated with developmental disease and malignant transformation.
SHH-producing cells extend thin, actin-based projections to transport SHH to receiving cells. These
specialized filopodia are termed “cytonemes” due to their thread-like appearance. Cytonemes are
proposed to play a key role in tightly regulating morphogen concentration gradients during
development. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms driving cytoneme formation.
This is mostly due to the difficulty to study the delicate structures using conventional fixation methods.
To permit mechanistic studies in vitro, our lab developed a modified electron microscopy fixative (MEM-
fix) protocol that preserves cytoneme integrity for confocal analysis. Using MEM-fix, along with a
combination of advanced imaging and biochemical techniques, our lab has found that expression of
SHH can promote cytoneme initiation in cultured murine fibroblasts. Furthermore, we identified a
requirement for the SHH coreceptors and adhesion proteins, Cell adhesion-associated, Down-
regulated by Oncogenes (CDON) and Brother of CDON (BOC), along with Dispatched (DISP)
deployment receptor in SHH-mediated cytoneme formation and stability. These findings along with
identification of interactions between SHH, DISP, and BOC as well as DISP and CDON point towards
cytoneme-initiating signaling occurring downstream of SHH binding to these transmembrane proteins.
However, the specific interactions and intracellular signaling pathways that initiate cytoneme outgrowth
have yet to be identified. My proposed project is focused on determining the SHH-activated signals
occurring in response to its association with BOC and DISP that drive cytoneme initiation in SHH-
producing cells. The first goal of my project is to elucidate the specific cell surface interactions between
DISP, BOC, CDON, and SHH that signal to intracellular cytoskeletal regulators. The second aspect of
my project is to elucidate the regulatory molecules that directly promote actin nucleation and
polymerization in response to SHH. To address these outstanding questions, I am combining targeted
genetic and biochemical techniques with advanced imaging approaches to methodically interrogate the
signal cascade resulting in SHH-mediated induction of cytoneme formation. I will confirm findings in
vivo by using our recently developed protocol facilitating imaging of cytonemes in mouse embryos."
10869901,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Despite the rapidly growing rate in obesity and tremendous efforts in weight loss research, the development of
safe and effective therapeutics has progressed significantly, yet is still limited, largely due to insufficient
understanding of how the brain manages body weight and feeding. Lorcaserin, a 5-HT (serotonin) receptor
agonist, showed great promise for effectively reducing weight, but was withdrawn due to increased risk for cancer
development. 5-HT remains an excellent potential target for an anti-obesity therapeutic, but more work needs to
be completed to determine the most effective way for targeting 5-HT. Previous work in this area has shown that
GABA and dopamine inhibition of 5-HT neurons is critical for mediating food intake in mice. In fact, my preliminary
work has revealed that 2 (GABA receptor subunit) deletion in TPH2 (rate limiting enzyme for 5-HT synthesis)
neurons causes a decreased meal number and increased meal interval compared to wild-type mice, indicating
a potential dysfunction in meal initiation. Furthermore, DRD2 (a dopamine receptor) deletion reduced miniature
inhibitory post synaptic current (mIPSC) in TPH2 neurons, indicating that DRD2 plays an essential role in
mediating 5-HT neuronal response to GABA inhibitory input. Finally, I found that in hungry mice, the selective
activation of 5-HT neurons in the Dorsal Raphe Nucleus (DRN) which project to the Arcuate Nucleus (ARH) in
the Hypothalamus during food approach significantly reduces food intake compared to control mice. Taken
together, these preliminary data led me to the hypothesis that GABA inputs to 5-HTDRN neurons are regulated, in
part, by DRD2 and may contribute to the regulation of meal initiation. The focus of this proposal is to 1) determine
whether the 5-HTDRN→ARH circuit regulates meal initiation and 2) to determine whether DA influences GABA
signaling to ARH-projecting 5-HTDRN neurons for meal initiation. To achieve these goals, I will examine (1)
whether photostimulation or photoinhibition of the 5-HTDRN→ARH circuit during food approach alters meal
initiation and food intake, and (2) the dynamic activity of ARH-projecting 5-HTDRN neurons before or during food
approach, at meal initiation, eating and meal termination using fiber photometry. Further, I will generate mice
with a selective deletion of either the GABAA γ2 subunit or DA receptor DRD2 in ARH-projecting 5-HTDRN neurons
and perform metabolic and meal pattern studies, and (2) examine the electrophysiological properties (mIPSC,
resting membrane potential, action potential firing, and their responses to GABA or DRD2 agonists) of ARH-
projecting 5-HTDRN neurons in which either the GABAA γ2 subunit or DA receptor DRD2 is deleted. With support
from this fellowship, I will utilize the extensive resources at Baylor College of Medicine to expand my expertise
so that I can advance in my career and learn more novel and comprehensive approaches to studying the
mechanisms underlying meal initiation. This opportunity will provide me with the necessary tools to enhance my
training and move toward my career goal of becoming an independent research scientist at an academic
institution."

Intervention Core will synthesize project-specific findings regarding the implementation and effectiveness of
standing orders support (Project 1), financial incentives (Project 2), and clinical champions (Project 3) into the
Announcement Approach Training (AAT) Intervention Package. AAT is a brief communication workshop that
helps primary care teams improve the way they recommend HPV vaccine and address parents' concerns. In a
prior randomized clinical trial, AAT increased HPV vaccine coverage by 5 percentage points over the control
within just 3 months. The proposed Program Project seeks to amplify AAT's impact by combining it with the
interventions to be tested in Projects 1-3. The Program Project will then compare the population impact and
cost-effectiveness of these interventions, including in rural areas (Project 4). The Intervention Core will support
the four research projects in the P01 to maximize the quality and comparability of AAT interventions delivered
and evaluated over the 5-year study period. Aim 1 is to convene a Clinical Advisory Board to provide
projects with multi-disciplinary implementation support. Our board includes leaders in pediatrics, family
medicine, nursing, quality improvement, and patient and family advocacy. Through quarterly meetings, the
board will support the development of intervention materials, the recruitment and retention of clinical sites, and
the interpretation and dissemination of study findings. Aim 2 is to prepare AAT facilitators and training
materials for intervention delivery. To achieve the highest-quality interventions, we will centralize (1) the

10907635,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Microplastics (MP, plastic particles < 5 mm) are pervasive in the environment and an emerging health
concern. MPs have the ability to accumulate chemical pollutants from the environment and contribute to
bioaccumulation of pollutants, making their consumption potentially hazardous. MPs have been found in nearly
all human tissue and specifically, nanoplastics (NPs, ≤ 1 µm) are of alarming concern due to the ability to enter
mammalian cells. Current research into the physiological or pathological effects of nanoplastic pollutant exposure
is limited, and the human risks of ingestion of NPs alone or combined with environmental chemicals are unknown.
The long-term goal is to understand the impact of NP exposure on biological systems. The overall objectives in
this application are to (i) establish Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) as a novel model system for NP-chemical
mixture research and (ii) to test the ability and impact of NPs as a delivery vehicle for environmental chemicals.
The central hypothesis is that NPs, which have absorbed environmental chemicals, will promote DNA damage
and subsequent changes in physiology. The rationale for this project is that chemical pollutants like pesticides
and phthalates are genotoxic and become concentrated in nanoplastics in the environment. Furthermore, model
organisms such as C. elegans can consume NPs and the chemicals contained in them are absorbed by the
animal. Two specific aims are proposed to test the central hypothesis: 1) Determine DNA damaging effects of
NPs and absorbed environmental chemicals and 2) Determine the physiological consequence of NPs and
absorbed environmental chemical exposure. Under the first aim, protocols will be established to quantify
chemical absorption in NPs, and to verify absorption and metabolism of ingested chemicals in C. elegans.
Additionally, we will evaluate DNA damage induced by NP-chemical mixtures by assessing frequency and
location of mutations using an established fluorescent-based reporter. For the second aim, C. elegans exposed
to NP-chemical mixtures will be observed for known physiological defects due to the NPs and chemicals alone,
with the hypothesis that combined effects will be more severe. Furthermore, we will correlate the presence of
DNA damage in specific tissues, with the observed phenotypic changes after NP-chemical exposure. The
research proposed in this application is innovative, in the applicant’s option, because it focuses on systematic
and rigorous methods to assess and determine the combined effects of NP and environmental chemical
toxicology on the cellular level in vivo and in a whole animal, a system that is currently not available. The
proposed research is significant because it is expected to provide strong scientific justification for continued
studies to prevent negative health outcomes due to NP-chemical mixture exposure and will inform exposure
limits on nanoplastics and environmental chemical pollutants. Ultimately such knowledge has the potential to
greatly add to our understanding of the additive toxicology of NPs and environmental chemicals and their risks
to human health."
10907752,"Chloropicrin (CP) and phosgene (PG) are widely available chemical threat agents, yet the
mechanisms of in vivo acute toxicity and long-term pathophysiologic impacts are not well
understood. CP, which is in current use as a soil fumigant to sterilize fields before planting high
value crops and is widely available. CP is known to cause a biphasic death response
characterized by lung edema that occurs either in the first 24 hrs or after 8-10 days. This suggests
immune cell mediated and tissue repair responses are key to determining outcomes. However
our new data also suggests that there is conducting airway and olfactory epithelial injury in the
acute phase of toxicity. The cellular targets and the LC50 for mice is not firmly established. The
pathogenesis is likely through tissue damage from binding of CP/PG or their metabolites to
sulfhydryl (SH) groups in proteins impacting cell viability and potentially modulated by elements
of xenobiotic metabolism in various cellular compartments, as well as instigation of an influx of
immune cells into the lung, including both macrophages and neutrophils. Our team is well
positioned to address the mechanism of action of these chemical threat agents due to our strong
research backgrounds in lung injury and repair (Van Winkle), inhalation exposure science of toxic
chemicals (Bein) and relation of tissue inflammation to biological responses (Vogel). The central
hypotheses are that PG is more potent than CP in inducing toxicity in mice and that adequate
repair is dependent on macrophages with functional CYP19A1, the estrogen synthesis enzyme.
The hypotheses will be addressed in three Specific Aims that will 1) Define the dose response
and acute injury pattern 2). Define the temporal pattern of lung injury and repair and 3) Test the
hypothesis that macrophage estrogen synthesis is important for lung tissue repair following CP
or PG exposure. These studies will advance our understanding of how acute injury, local
metabolism and target cell type and estrogen synthesizing macrophages contribute tooutcomes
following in vivo exposures to CP or PG. This will advance our understanding of tissue specific
responses, a research area that is, of necessity, best investigated in animal models and which
sets the stage for medical interventions."
10897953,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic pancreatitis (CP) results from progressive inflammation and fibrosis, most commonly from acute
pancreatitis (AP) and recurrent episodes of AP (RAP), and is associated with long term complications of diabetes
and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Pain is one of three diagnostic criteria for AP and multiple studies have
now confirmed that pain is also the most significant symptom for patients with CP (77-93%). While there
are a variety of interventions available to treat pain, many of which are not efficacious in CP patient: only ~25%
chronic pancreatitis patients achieve meaningful pain relief with current standard of care for pain
management. As of now, there are no chronic pancreatitis pain biomarkers to stratify pain based on severity
and/or type, which would guide physician decision making or monitor therapeutic responses. This contributes to
the immense burden of pain in this CP patient population.
To address this gap in knowledge, we will leverage the PROspective Evaluation of Chronic Pancreatitis for
EpidEmiologic and Translational StuDies (PROCEED) which has been realized under the auspice of the NIDDK-/
NCI-funded Consortium for the Study of Chronic Pancreatitis, Diabetes, and Pancreatic Cancer (CPDPC).
PROCEED, which will be a key resource for this proposal, is the first prospective longitudinal CP cohort in the
U.S. It has enrolled 1638 (and counting) participants with CP, AP, and RAP, as well as healthy and non-
pancreatitis symptomatic controls. All participants of this unique cohort undergo deep phenotyping, provide
detailed information on clinical symptoms, and general QoL variables. Furthermore, 10 pain-associated variables
are recorded providing detailed information about pain types, severities and interventions. Due to the size and
multi-site nature of PROCEED, the cohort was split into independent discovery and validation cohorts to enable
FDA-compliant biomarker validation. In Specific Aims 1 and 2 of this proposal, we will use plasma and urine
samples from the PROCEED discovery cohort (n >500) to generate quantitative multi-omics datasets of the
proteins, chemokines, cytokines and neuropeptides. Mass spectrometry-based discovery proteomics and
multiplexed antibody-based assays will be used for the biomarker identification.
Upon discovery of promising pain biomarkers, we will transition to the validation phase (Specific Aims 3 and 4).
In this phase, we will use the urine and plasma samples from the independent PROCEED validation cohort (n
>500) to validate the potential biomarkers identified in the Specific Aims 1 and 2. We will use targeted liquid
chromatography/mass spectrometry methods as well as antibody-based method for the validation. The large
number of PROCEED samples and their superb annotation will allow for an exquisitely granular pain-focused
analysis of the resulting large scale proteomic and cytokine/chemokine assay data."
10909123,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Macrophage polarization is involved in the progression of normal physiological and pathological
processes. The near universal importance of macrophage has led to widescale assessment of
the genomic and proteomic to classify their function. However, it is still a challenge to measure
macrophage polarization in real time such as in the context of assessing the status of a biomaterial
implant or the efficacy of a nanoparticle drug delivery system in a solid tumor. Our preliminary
data show that bioluminescence microscopy is able to deliver the protein expression data valuable
for macrophage polarization combined the cell tracking capability of traditional imaging system.
This research program will address the current gap in real-time assessment of macrophage
polarization by 1) further developing the technology to measure macrophage polarization
dynamics using bioluminescence microscopy and 2) assessing the intrinsic and extracellular
environmental stimuli that are most important for sensing macrophage polarization in a diseased
environment context. To accomplish these goals, we will employ ex-vivo culture systems and live
bioluminescence imaging. This work will identify novel strategies for measuring macrophage
polarization and validate the importance of analyzing polarization in a disease context. Ultimately,
this research will lead to new strategies for synthetic biology development, enhancement of
diagnostic testing and development of new therapeutic targets. In addition, the knowledge and
tools developed can be applied to other cells where polarization is paramount such as stem cell
differentiation, chemoattraction, and cell metabolism."
10929402,"Neurons in adults are essentially irreplaceable and especially vulnerable to the
accumulation of protein aggregates, dysfunctional mitochondria, and similarly distractive
agents. The most important pathway available to neurons to limit such damage is
autophagy. This pathway, initially described in the context of the mTor-regulated
starvation-induced metabolic rescue pathway in yeast and mammalian cells, is initiated
by the formation of an isolation membrane followed by its expansion, the engulfment of
cytoplasmic content into a closed autophagosome and its fusion to the lysosomes and
degradation of autophagosomal content. Beyond its importance in the starvation
response, starvation and mTor-independent autophagy is increasingly recognized as an
important quality control mechanism that reduces degeneration of neurons and
photoreceptor cells and has implications for cancer and infectious diseases. Therefore,
the distinct cellular signaling pathways that adjust the rate of autophagy to the cell’s
physiology are important to understand. Because excessive autophagy is lethal to cells,
the different signaling pathways inducing autophagy must be careful coordinated and
calibrated. For one such pathway, the Acinus protein is as a critical regulator. The
Acinus protein integrates signals from multiple pathways to modulate the function of core
autophagy proteins and stimulate the induction of starvation-independent autophagy.
This grant aims to understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate the levels of Acn
protein and its activity. For this purpose, in Aim 1, we propose to define upstream
regulators of Acinus including the phosphatases and kinases responsible for regulating
its activity and explore their potential as possible drug targets. In Aim 2, we will analyze
the mechanistic link between Acinus and its effector Atg1, the master regulatory kinase
of the autophagy pathway. In Aim 3, we will explore physiological consequences of
disrupting the Acn-Atg1 signaling module in the context of visual system."
10841558,"Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) detects foreign DNA during infection or self-DNA leading to
autoinflammatory diseases such as Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome. cGAS signals via STING, a receptor for cyclic
GMP-AMP generated by cGAS. A series of gain-of-function mutations resulting in constitutive activation of
STING have been associated with a debilitating autoinflammatory disease called STING-Associated-
Vasculopathy with onset in Infancy (SAVI). SAVI patients suffer from severe vasculitic lesions and interstitial
lung disease (ILD) and frequently succumb to respiratory failure. Like the lung conditions associated with other
autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic sclerosis, very little is known about the
mechanisms that promote inflammation in these patients. To gain insights into the mechanisms of STING driven
inflammation in the lung, we have developed a murine model for the most common SAVI mutation, STINGV154M
(VM), and found that mice heterozygous for this mutation develop immune abnormalities and lung disease. Lung
endothelial cells are among the highest STING-expressing cells in the lung and based on our preliminary data
we believe that auto-inflammation in the VM lung results from the direct effects of the SAVI mutation on “initiator”
radioresistant cells (endothelial cells, and/or fibroblasts) resulting in stromal cell activation, differentiation,
chemokine production and expansion. Lymphocytes (VM or WT) are then recruited to the lung. The recruited
effector T cells further promote the pathogenic activity of both radioresistant cells and myeloid cells, leading to
chronic inflammation; IFN plays a key role in this process. How the VM SAVI allele mediate disease
pathogenesis in stromal cells remains unknown. We will focus on STING activation in endothelial cells and how
these events lead to lymphocyte recruitment, activation and pathology. Aim 1 will determine the lymphocyte-
independent effect of SAVI mutations on lung innate immune function. Aim 2 will define the role of infiltrating T
cells in the development of VM ILD while Aim 3 will define VM-driven signaling events in ECs and the impact of
STING-targeted therapeutics on ILD. There is an urgent need to identify better therapies for patients afflicted
with autoimmune and autoinflammatory lung disorders and the studies proposed in this application should
provide critical insights that will enable us to design the best therapies. Further, these studies will also provide
an opportunity to study the impact of STING activation on stromal cell types more generally, an emerging area
of research as STING activity in endothelial cells has recently been linked to the development of severe
COVID19."
10833682,"Project Summary Protein synthesis and ribosome biogenesis are the two most energy -intensive
processes in a cell, resulting in their regulation through tight controls. EpoR, a member of the cytokine receptor
superfamily, and its downstream mediator Stat5, are essential for erythropoiesis. The current proposal
addresses novel regulation of ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis by EpoR and Stat5 signaling during a
key erythroid developmental decision. In recently published work we found that EpoR/ Stat5 stimulate shorter
and more numerous cycles in early erythroblasts, while also promoting formation of larger erythroblasts that
mature into larger red cells, in both mice and humans. This surprising finding suggests that EpoR/ Stat5
signaling alters the relationship between cell cycle duration and cell size, simultaneously inducing shorter
cycles and exceptionally fast growth in biomass. In preliminary data supporting this hypothesis, single-cell RNA
sequencing of Epor-/- and Stat5-/- fetal livers show dysregulated expression of ribosome biogenesis and
translation genes. Further, we identified an EpoR/ Stat5-dependent sharp spike in the rate of rRNA
transcription (~2.5 fold), protein synthesis rate (~4 to 6 fold) and rate of growth in cell size (~3 fold), that
coincides with a key cell fate decision. It takes place as early erythroid progenitors known as CFU-e transition
from self-renewal to erythroid terminal differentiation (ETD), becoming erythroblasts. The spike in protein
synthesis at this time also coincides with an unusually short cell cycle. Immediately following the CFU-e/ETD
transition, the rates of ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis begin to decline back to baseline together
with the decline in cell cycle speed, even though erythroblasts continue to divide and synthesize hemoglobin
for an additional 3 to 5 cell divisions. The coincidence in the spikes of protein synthesis and ribosome
biogenesis with cell cycle shortening at the CFU-e/ETD switch suggests that these processes are linked and
may be functionally relevant to the switch. We will investigate the EpoR/Stat5- induced spike in protein
synthesis with the following aims: Aim 1: Investigate the EpoR /Stat5 -induced spike in ribosome biogenesis &
protein synthesis, determining the intracellular signaling pathways that are mediating this spike and identifying
a potential subset of transcripts whose translation rate spikes. Aim 2: Determine causal relationships between
the cell cycle, ribosome biogenesis, protein synthesis and cell size. The regulatory interactions between cell
cycle duration, protein synthesis rate and cell size in mammalian cells are not well understood and yet are
critical in development and in cancer. Aim 3: Test the hypothesis that the EpoR /Stat5 -induced spike in protein
synthesis is required for erythroid differentiation. We will determine whether the EpoR-induced spike in protein
synthesis is an 'Achilles heel' in mice deficient in the ribosomal protein Rpl11, a model of Diamond Blackfan
Anemia, potentially explaining the selective sensitivity of the erythroid lineage to ribosomopathies."
10903856,"SUMMARY (Core B)
One of the key strengths of this Program Project is the powerful reciprocal relationship of in silico modeling and
simulation with targeted structural and functional experimentation. Thus, experimental results can be
channeled back into in situ studies to iteratively improve models. The overarching goal of the Computational
Biology Core (Core B) is to take advantage of information from the literature, experimental results from our
Program, and ab initio modeling to create, and continually improve, molecularly detailed structural models and
functional hypotheses for each step, and each major player, in cholesterol efflux. The core is structured to
provide the following services: 1) create model structures and perform several varieties of molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations of molecular models—SMD, CGMD, STMD—relevant to each Project; 2) refine structures of
ABCA1, APOA1, and various HDL particles generated during the previous PPG cycle; 3) provide a platform for
comparing molecular models to experimental data (chemical crosslinking, HDL particle sizes derived from ion
mobility analyses, HDL composition, etc.). One primary tool will be construction of protein contact maps; 4) use
LOCATE to analyze and refine the molecular basis for interactions of amphipathic helical domains of APOA1,
APOA2, and other apolipoproteins with each other as well as their interactions with ABCA1; 5) use Rosetta for
ab initio modeling and docking (e.g. APOA1’s interactions with ABCA1; APOA2’s interactions with APOA1,
etc.). Core B will be led by Jere Segrest, MD, PhD, working closely with Hyun Song, PhD, at Vanderbilt
University Medical Center campus, near where Project 3 is located. Both investigators have extensive, well-
documented expertise in all areas of the Core’s proposed services. In the previous PPG cycle, the Core
executed thousands of hours of computer simulations that generated dozens of detailed molecular models for
experimental testing by all three Projects. Many of these models will contribute critically to the ongoing studies
proposed in this renewal cycle."

10922773,"Project Summary – Resource (Vector) Core
The Viral Vector Core was established in 2003 to meet the emerging interest in using AAV & lentiviral vectors
for muscle gene transfer. The required specialized techniques and reagents prevented most labs from being
able to generate the high titer and enormous quantities of vectors needed for systemic gene delivery, challenges
that remain today. Consequently, a Viral Vector Core was established to generate vectors for Wellstone Centers,
but which has been expanded to allow access to a broader range of users via a recharge mechanism. This
Vector Core is our Scientific Research Resource Core. The Core provides high quality preparations of viral and
plasmid vectors to facilitate research related to the muscular dystrophies. Services offered by the Core include
vectors, reagents, consulting, and training related to vector production. This includes production of adeno-
associated and lentiviral vectors and muscular dystrophy related reagents (cell lines, vector backbones,
protocols, antibodies etc) for members of this Center as well as laboratories in the US and across the World to
support their efforts related to gene transfer and gene therapy for the muscular dystrophies. The Principle
Investigator is Dr. Joel Chamberlain, who has worked closely with Core personnel on AAV and retroviral vectors
for more than 15 years. The Core has established protocols and acquired reagents for lentiviral and adeno-
associated viral vectors, particularly AAV6, 8 and 9, but also for other pseudotyped vectors including AAV1, 2,
5, 7 and several recently identified myotropic (e.g. AAVMyo) capsids. We also have numerous muscle cDNAs,
such as for dystrophin and utrophin, muscle regulatory cassettes and antibodies that are available via this Core
lab, as well as DM1, DUX4 and associated RNAi vectors. We provide high quality, high titer preparations of AAV
and lentiviral vectors and also encourage users to visit the Core to learn, or request, our methods. Vectors and
reagents are provided to members of our Wellstone Center using funds from this Core, and to other muscular
dystrophy researchers on a recharge basis at cost. Training services allow investigators to apply methods for
production and purification of viral vectors in their own labs as desired, and will be advertised via the Center Web
site. Consulting will be available to guide the use of AAV and lentiviral vectors. Finally, we provide reagents (such
as vector backbones, plasmids, antibodies) that have been developed by members of this Wellstone Center to
outside labs."
10922780,"Gene therapy is a promising treatment for the muscular dystrophies. Our Center has played major roles in
advancing the use of AAV for muscle disease. These include extensive characterization of dystrophin and DUX4
expression and function, the discovery that AAV can be used for systemic gene delivery to muscle, and
generation of numerous small, muscle-specific expression cassettes (MSECs), micro-dystrophins (μDys) and
RNAi cassettes. These advances have enabled multiple gene therapy trials for DMD, LGMDs, XL-MTM1and
other muscle disorders. We have also developed and advanced many skeletal and cardiac muscle testing
platforms and tools useful for muscle gene therapies, including 3D DMD human iPSC-derived engineered muscle
tissues and a DMD rat model. However, current AAV- μDys therapies are not as effective as hoped, and AAV-
RNAi therapies for FSHD and other dominant disorders have not advanced to the clinic. Here we propose two
related aims to address limitations of AAV gene therapies: (A) Testing new AAV capsid variants for cardiac and
skeletal muscles, iterative testing of novel micro-dystrophins, larger split-intein dystrophins, and MSEC designs
to minimize immunogenicity and increase cardiac and skeletal muscle potency; (B) Application of enhanced
cassettes and vectors for DUX4 transcript knock-down in FSHD therapy. In Aim 1, we develop vectors to improve
DMD clinical interventions that have been limited by the levels and functionality of therapeutic dystrophins, and
by very high vector doses that have caused serious adverse events (SAEs) in some patients due to
immunological reaction to the vector and/or transgene. We will compare multiple myotropic serotypes, which
show significantly increased muscle transduction to deliver novel transgene cassettes that have been designed
for reduced immunogenicity and increased potency, especially in cardiac muscle. A major focus will include the
testing of novel, split-intein AAV vectors to produce mini- and full-length dystrophins. We also test a dual vector
strategy to recover depressed function in the heart via overexpression of an enzyme (RNR) that elevates cardiac
dATP, a small molecule myosin activator. Studies of immune response to dystrophin will be augmented by
screening patient blood cells for immune reactivity. In Aim 2 we combine the myotropic vectors with enhanced
RNAi cassettes to advance gene therapy for FSHD. This experimental plan combines vector developments from
Aim 1 with new FSHD animal models and FSHD clinical studies from Project 2. Genetic and phenotypic changes
in the FLExDUX4 mouse model of FSHD will be targeted via local and systemic delivery of AAV-DUX4 RNAi,
while further studies will evaluate these AAV-DUX4 RNAi vectors in the Göttingen minipig model of FSHD that
is being characterized in Project 2. DUX4 gene silencing and reduction of inflammation in the minipig will be
measured by MRI, muscle structural changes, and biomarkers based on clinical results from Project 2. Together,
experimental strategies in Projects 1 and 2 will facilitate the potential for gene therapy by addressing current
limitations resulting from vector potency, immunity, transgene expression, and animal model deficiencies."
10919786,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The androgen receptor (AR) is the main driver of prostate cancer (PC) development and progression, which has
led to a concerted effort to develop pharmacological agents to ablate AR activity and extend survival in men with
metastatic prostate cancer. However, paradoxically, increasingly potent AR pathway inhibitors (ARPI) therapies
have shaped the emergence of highly aggressive lineage plastic tumours with markedly distinct epigenetic
profiles, low canonical AR signaling, and activation of neuronal and developmental/stem cell-associated
transcriptional programs. Recent clinical observations support that ~20% of advanced PCa patients with distinct
genomic alteration including loss of TP53, RB1 and PTEN and upregulation of EZH2 are more primed to develop
lineage plasticity and neuroendocrine phenotype. Notably, prognosis remains poor due to a lack of our
understanding of the molecular and functional cell states underlying lineage reprogramming. Hence it is crucial
to improve our understanding of these emergent resistance mechanisms in genomically segmented populations
in order to better inform future development of novel therapeutic strategies. We developed a novel clinical and
translational neoadjuvant platform as a framework to understand the molecular basis for responses to intensive
ARPI therapy. This adaptive multi-stage, multi-arm trial, named the Genomic Umbrella Neoadjuvant Study
(GUNS, NCT04812366), will evaluate ARPI-based therapeutic combinations in biomarker pre-selected patients
with high-risk localized PC. We hypothesize that genomic alterations determine depth of response to ARPI, and
that co-targeting the AR with other contextually relevant targets defined by specific genomic subtype will increase
rates of pCR and minimal residual disease in high-risk localized PCa. Certain PC subtypes with loss (isolated or
combined) of TP53, RB, PTEN, BRCA or gain in MYC and upregulation of EZH2, are better primed to survive,
adapt, develop linage plasticity, and progress after ARPI.
We will test our hypothesis in the following aims:
Aim 1: Define the genomic predisposition of response to potent neoadjuvant ARPI in the GUNS trial.
Aim 2: Assess fidelity of response and pathways activation to ARPI with targeted therapies in PDX models with
 analogous genomic alterations matched with subprotocols in GUNS.
Aim 3: Conduct sub-protocol 5 in GUNS to evaluate combined ARPI with EZH2 inhibitor, tazemetostat, in PCs
 with defined genetic subtypes."

respond to the dynamic nature of the catchment area, and potential resultant shifts in research priorities. COE
also integrates the real-world experiences of the community and other strategic partners with HDFCCC
research activities. This is done by engaging and sustaining community partnerships and facilitating
bidirectional collaboration across the Center. COE ensures that the priorities, functions, and accomplishments
of the Center are informed by and responsive to the burden of cancer, the center's priority cancers, and the
needs and characteristics of the individuals and populations living in the catchment area. Meaningful
community engagement underlies all aspects of the Center’s mission-driven themes of Impactful Discovery,
Effective Translation, and Implementation and Dissemination. COE will impact the HDFCCC mission of driving
scientific discovery and developing tailored interventions to improve cancer outcomes in its catchment area

engaged, relevant to the catchment area, or both; and increased capacity for engaged research of the
community and HDFCCC. Long-term, this will result in strengthened relationships between UCSF and the
community; increased access to cancer clinical trials; and changes in institutional, regional, and state level
policies that aim to reduce the burden of cancer, promote equity, and improve cancer survival. To accomplish
these goals, COE seeks to (1) understand the demographics and cancer burden of the catchment area; (2)
engage the community and catalyze bi-directional collaborations and research; (3) support equitable access to

PLAN TO ENHANCE DIVERSITY - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Montefiore Einstein Cancer Center’s overarching mission is to become a national model for reducing cancer
incidence and disparities in the most diverse and impoverished catchment area of all NCI-designated cancer
centers in the U.S. Our Plan to Enhance Diversity will ensure that all groups that are underrepresented in the
cancer workforce, including individuals from very different demographic, racial, ethnic, religious, gender and
sexual orientation backgrounds, etc., currently not represented in visible numbers in cancer research, education
and clinical care delivery given the population of our catchment area in the Bronx, have the opportunity and are
supported to participate and be included in all aspects of our Cancer Center activities. We plan to achieve this
goal by establishing, sustaining, and continuously monitoring our investments in institutional infrastructure and
implementing programs to establish, promote, and sustain a culture of diversity, equity and inclusivity, increase
participation of women, racial/ethnic minorities, and other underrepresented groups in the cancer workforce and
in leadership through pipeline program with key stakeholders in the Bronx, and building, by strengthening and
evaluating the capacity of the workforce to integrate a culture of diversity, equity and inclusivity excellence in
research, clinical care delivery and community engagement. It is essential that an effective plan to enhance
diversity must be cross-cutting, and for this reason, we will synergistically coordinate all activities among other
components of the Cancer Center such as Community Outreach and Engagement (COE) and Cancer Research,
Training and Education Coordination (CRTEC) components, Cancer Epidemiology, Prevention and Control

time employees to 75+, including existing and planned recruits, who support nine Disease and Modality Teams
and over 80 investigators. Since the prior review, the CPDM has undergone a leadership restructuring. Balazs
Halmos, MD, was appointed Associate Director for Clinical Science and interim Medical Director of the CCTO in
2021, and Nicholas Shuman, MSN, was recruited in June 2022 to serve as the Senior Director, Cancer Clinical
Research Administration and oversee the daily operations of the CCTO. During the last funding period,
interventional accruals remained strong in 2019 (559) but due to the COVID-19 pandemic and staff shortages,
had a precipitous decline in 2020 (281). In 2021, Interventional accruals rebounded to 447. The CCTO continues
to prioritize MECC science and investigator-initiated clinical trials. In 2021, 23.5% of treatment accruals and 36%
of interventional enrollments were to institutional trials. The CCTO also supports participation in multiple National
Clinical Trials Network studies (38% of treatment accruals in 2021) under the Minority Underserved NCORP
grant and our involvement in the NCI Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network (ET-CTN). New
initiatives beyond the creation of the CCTO as a separate business unit include: (1) the development of a
Feasibility Committee to increase operational efficiencies and decrease time to activation, (2) through our
collaborative efforts with Community Outreach and Engagement we demonstrated continued success in the
enrollment of underrepresented groups (URG) (>80% of accruals identify as URG), (3) a restructuring of the
Data and Safety Monitoring Committee to conduct monitoring of MECC investigator-initiated trials on a risk-
based approach to align with the NCI CCSG PAR, (4) expansion of the Quality Assurance Program, with
dedicated staff - Assistant Director of Quality Assurance, and (5) key faculty clinician investigator recruitments
in hematology, neuro-oncology and Phase I.

PROTOCOL REVIEW AND MONITORING SYSTEM - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS) provides scientific oversight of all clinical and translational
research performed at the Montefiore Einstein Cancer Center (MECC). In 2022, the PRMC has undergone
significant leadership changes and the development of a second review committee, PRMC-A, which focuses on
interventional trials involving drugs or devices and basic science protocols, and PRMC-B which focuses on
population health studies. PRMS functions are carried out via a two-stage review. The Disease and Modality
Teams (DMT) and the Feasibility Committee (FC) conduct Stage-1 reviews and the Protocol Review and
Monitoring Committee (PRMC) conducts the scientific review in Stage-2. The PRMC committees are composed
of multidisciplinary groups whose members have expertise and experience in therapeutics, drug development,
population health science and translational science. The two-stage review process is conducted to eliminate
inefficiencies: reducing the number of studies of lesser scientific merit or deemed not feasible being submitted
and reviewed by the committee, reducing staff effort in preparing submissions, and allowing the PRMC to focus
on the scientific merits of a study. The PRMC performs a complete scientific review of all institutional investigator-
initiated and industry- sponsored cancer-related protocols. The PRMC does not duplicate traditional peer review,
which includes peer-reviewed protocols supported by the various NIH mechanisms, other approved funding
agencies, and clinical research protocols supported by NCI’s Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program or Cancer
Control Protocol Review Committee. All NCI-sponsored protocols that have undergone prior peer review undergo
an expedited administrative review by the FC and PRMC. Over the prior 3-year period (1/1/2019-12/31/2021)
there have been 242 studies reviewed at the full board and 94 expedited reviews. Functions of the PRMC are
complementary to the Institutional Review Board (IRB), which focuses on the protection of human subjects, and
separate from those of the MECC Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC). The PRMC ensures that all trials
have appropriate data safety and monitoring plans in place; data and safety monitoring functions are the
responsibility of the DSMC. The PRMC is also charged with the ongoing monitoring of accruals, scientific
progress and continued scientific relevance of all clinical studies conducted at the MECC. With the PRMC
leadership changes in 2022, there has been significant focus placed on closing low accruing trials and studies
that are no longer clinically relevant. Over the prior 3-year period, 178 studies have been queried by the PRMC
for low accrual and 25 studies closed by the DMT and PRMC for low accrual.

STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY SHARED RESOURCE - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Structural Biology Shared Resource (SBSR) supports a wide range of technologies for identifying new
targets, defining molecular mechanisms, and generating tool compounds and therapeutic leads. Services
include: 1) state-of-the-art protein production; 2) high resolution structure determination by X-ray crystallography,
NMR and cryo-EM; 3) mass spectrometry-based proteomics analyses; and 4) additional advanced technologies.
SBSR provides access to state-of-the-art infrastructure located in-house and at regional centers and national
laboratories to support the scientific priorities outlined in the MECC Strategic Plan. Protein-based tools facilitate
the mechanistic dissection of fundamental biological and pathological processes, and the validation of potential
therapeutic strategies in cell- and animal-based disease models. Mass spectrometry and proteomics enables
the discovery of new targets and biomarkers, and provides deep mechanistic insight into responses associated
with disease states and treatment regimens. Structural data provide atomic-resolution insight for protein design
and medicinal chemistry essential for enhancing initial hits and lead therapeutics. The SBSR Specific Aims are:
Aim 1: Provide state-of-the-art technologies for protein expression, purification and characterization, and
validation. These resources include bacterial, insect cell, and mammalian cell expression platforms supported
by considerable automation to facilitate these efforts. SBSR staff provide the full range of support services,
including construct design and downstream characterization.
Aim 2: Enable high resolution structural characterization. Available resources include in-house capabilities in
NMR, X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM, as well as extensive access to state-of-the art national facilities for
NMR and cryo-EM (New York Structural Biology Center) and X-ray crystallography (Brookhaven National
Laboratory and Argonne National Laboratory). SBSR staff provide the full range of support services, including
data collection and processing, structure determination, validation, and structure interpretation.
Aim 3: Provide state-of-the-art mass spectrometry capabilities for proteomics analyses, including protein
abundance, determination of regulated protein pathways and other networks, identification and quantification of
protein post-translational modifications and protein synthesis rates. SBSR staff provide the full range of support
services, spanning experimental design, sample preparation, data acquisition and data interpretation.
The breadth of core services supports the entire spectrum of investigators, and the extensive coordination among
the SBSR leaders allows for the seamless movement among core-supported technologies. As such, projects
can enter the pipeline at any stage. For example, inexperienced investigators can enter the pipeline at the protein
expression stage and receive support all the way through structure determination and interpretation.

10909263,"Project Summary/Abstract
This project addresses the role of astrocyte bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling in the pathogenesis of
Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). FXS is the most common inherited form of intellectual disability (ID) and autism
spectrum disorder (ASD). FXS is caused by trinucleotide repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene promoter leading
to transcriptional silencing, and FXS is most often modeled with the Fmr1 knockout (KO) mouse. Although
research has implicated several pathways mediating the effects of the Fmr1 loss of function, most targeted
treatments have failed in clinical trials, and FXS is predominantly treated by symptom only. The majority of
research in FXS has focused on intrinsic changes within neurons. However, emerging research in FXS implicates
astrocytes, specifically through astrocyte-secreted factors. Wild-type (WT) neurons cultured with astrocytes or
astrocyte-conditioned media (ACM) from Fmr1 KO mice exhibit stunted neurite outgrowth and recapitulate the
immature dendritic spine phenotype observed in vivo in Fmr1 KO mice and human FXS patients, providing direct
evidence for a causal role of astrocyte-secreted factors in FXS. Preliminary data profiling FXS astrocyte
transcription and protein secretion identified four proteins both overexpressed in mRNA and oversecreted, one
of which is BMP6. Furthermore, activation of BMP signaling in WT astrocytes generates over a third of the protein
secretion changes of FXS astrocytes, while abrogation of BMP signaling in FXS astrocytes abolishes neurite
outgrowth deficits. The goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that BMP signaling in astrocytes is upstream
of neurodevelopmental FXS deficits in vivo and to identify the astrocyte-secreted proteins that mediate this effect.
A combined genetic and viral approach to selective knock out Bmpr2 or Smad4 in astrocytes will be used to
assess whether downregulation of astrocyte BMP signaling can rescue in vivo FXS abnormalities in dendritic
spines, plasticity, and behavior. An astrocyte-specific in vivo proteomic approach combined with characterization
of specific proteins in vitro will identify proteins downstream of BMP signaling responsible for FXS deficits. These
experiments will determine if BMP signaling in astrocytes mediates FXS deficits in vivo and elucidate
mechanisms by which it occurs, thereby providing new insight into a previously underappreciated aspect of FXS
pathophysiology. The proposed research will take place in the Allen Laboratory at the Salk Institute for Biological
Studies, a collaborative research environment that provides access to all necessary equipment and training.
Through theoretical and practical training in molecular neurobiology, collaboration with supporters of diverse
research and clinical backgrounds, and a research team committed to mentorship, the proposed research
training plan will enable rigorous instruction in research and lay the foundation for a future career as an
independent physician-scientist."
10906653,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Craniofacial anomalies are the 2nd leading structural malformation to appear at birth,
with the most common forms occurring in the mid- and upper-face regions. However, our limited understanding
in the molecular mechanisms controlling their development has hindered strategies for effective treatment and
prevention. Several studies have identified the pathways underlying lower face formation during embryonic
development (e.g., jaw and teeth). Yet, less emphasis has been placed on the midface, and the unique
mechanisms orchestrating the development of this region are poorly understood. The long-term goal of this study
is to dissect the molecular underpinnings governing midface development and how their dysregulation causes
dysplasia. We and others have independently uncovered key midface genes that function within the neural crest,
an embryonic stem cell population that gives rise to facial bone and cartilage. For example, deletion of Alx1/3/4
(Alx), whose loss causes syndromic forms of Frontonasal Dysplasia, lead to a severe midfacial cleft in mice. Our
lab has found that loss of Tfap2 in the neural crest compromises expression of Alx genes and presents the same
midface cleft as the Alx knockout embryos. Thus, our overall objective in this research proposal is to leverage
this new animal model for Frontonasal Dysplasia to uncover how TFAP2 transcription factors operate within the
midface-unique gene regulatory networks (GRN’s). To approach this objective, we test the overall hypothesis
that TFAP2 transcription factors directly regulate Alx gene expression for appropriate neural crest survival,
midface fusion, and skeletal formation. In AIM 1, we will employ genome- and epigenome-wide assays
(CUT&RUN, ATAC-seq) to decipher how TFAP2 targets Alx and shapes the genome landscape to regulate their
expression levels. We will leverage zebrafish reporter strategies to test TFAP2-bound Alx noncoding enhancers
for midface specificity. In AIM 2, we will couple sophisticated mouse genetics with immunofluorescence and
skeletal analyses to characterize how Tfap2 and Alx genetically interact to control neural crest viability, behavior,
and formation of the skeletal elements. Completion of these aims will fill a critical knowledge gap in our
understanding for how these genes and pathways are linked to shape the developing midface. Such knowledge
will contribute to the development of strategies in treating midfacial disorders or even preventing them. The
principal investigator of this study, Mr. Nguyen, has extensive training in mouse genetics, embryology, and gene
expression profiling techniques highlighted in this proposal. With combined mentorship from Drs. Van Otterloo
and Amendt, Mr. Nguyen will develop skills in genome-wide molecular assays, next-generation sequencing
approaches, bioinformatic techniques, and immunofluorescent and confocal microscopy methods; collectively,
greatly advancing his doctoral training and expanding his research toolkit. The training plan, established team,
and institutional environment outlined in this research proposal will not only pave the way to improving
craniofacial treatment and health, but also catalyze his career towards becoming an independent researcher."
10824244,"Project Summary/Abstract
Alcohol use is among the most prominent public health problems and contributors to health disparities for
Black adults [48], which is reflected in the high rates of alcohol-related mortality and morbidity among Black
populations [49]. Indeed, although Black adults tend to have equivalent or even lower rates of alcohol use
compared to their white counterparts [3], Black adults experience higher rates of alcohol use disorders [4] as
well as more alcohol-related social consequences [5] and legal issues [6-7]. These findings highlight the need
for future research examining alcohol use and problems among Black adults. Depression symptoms are critical
to study in this regard as they have consistently been found to be associated with alcohol use and problems in
cross-sectional studies of Black adults [15, 53, 94]. Addressing important limitations in the extant research, the
goal of the proposed study is to explicate the momentary associations between depression symptoms and
alcohol use and problems as well as to consider the influence of culturally relevant factors in acute risk for
alcohol use and problems among Black adults with varying severities of depression symptoms. Specifically,
although not yet empirically tested among Black adults, the momentary relations between depression
symptoms and alcohol use and problems among Black adults may be reciprocal, whereby depression
symptoms serve as both an antecedent and a consequence of alcohol use and problems [10-12]. Moreover,
racial stressors and symptoms are culturally relevant factors that may substantially increase proximal risk for
alcohol use and problems among Black adults, and their influence may be stronger in those with greater
severity of depression symptoms (i.e., moderation). To address these questions, the proposed study will recruit
60 Black adults in the community who report regular alcohol use in the past month. Participants will complete a
baseline interview, following which they will take part in 14 days of ecological momentary assessment (three
surveys per day). Micro-longitudinal methods are a rigorous and ecologically valid approach for capturing
fluctuations in symptoms/experiences that increase risk for alcohol use and problems. This project will provide
the Applicant with invaluable training to (1) bolster understanding of alcohol use disorders; (2) advance
knowledge and conduct of research on the co-occurrence of depression symptoms and alcohol use among
Black individuals; (3) acquire proficiency in utilizing micro-longitudinal methodology and data analytic
techniques; (4) advance training in minority health and health disparities; and (5) build skills for grantsmanship
and research dissemination. The ultimate goal of the project is to aid in further investigation of culturally
relevant factors among historically underrepresented individuals in research, with the prospect of informing
alcohol interventions for Black adults with depression."

The goal of this SC3 grant is to develop a novel method for the cryopreservation of proteins
without the use of co-solvents, which are usually employed to limit the structural changes that can
occur during freezing. The method exploits the glass polymorphism of water, i.e., low density
amorphous (LDA) and high density amorphous (HDA) glasses can be produced following specific
cooling/compression pathways. The pathways for storage and recovery of proteins will be studied
using non-equilibrium molecular dynamic simulations coupled to all-atom force fields. The central
hypothesis is that the density of the HDA will limit fluctuations in the solution upon cooling and the
protein will not undergo any significant structural changes when vitrified in HDA. The rationale
for the proposed research is that an understanding of the detailed mechanism by which proteins
are preserved in glassy water, can lead to the rational design of experiments that allow for more
controlled subzero protein preservation. In order to systematically develop this understanding
three groups of systems, with increasing order of structural complexity will be studied: (i) short
peptides with different secondary structures (ii) simple proteins that contain these secondary
structures within their tertiary structures, and (iii) two biomedically relevant proteins. The
information obtained from these studies has the potential to be extended to the storage of
pharmaceuticals, food, and biological cells without the use of co-solvents."
10894263,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a recently discovered group of single-stranded RNAs that lack ends. The
spliceosome complex produces a circRNA by back-splicing precursor mRNA instead of forward-splicing to
produce a linear RNA. While the biological functions of circRNAs are distinct from linear RNAs, the
mechanisms of how the cell distinguishes between circRNAs and their related linear RNAs, which share the
same primary sequence, is not known. During the biogenesis of circRNAs, cells have the opportunity to install
post-transcriptional modifications and RNA-binding proteins that mark the RNAs as circular. These “molecular
signatures” on circRNAs have the potential to control the cellular trafficking of circRNAs and direct them to
locations that are distinct from where their related linear RNAs reside. We hypothesize that cells employ post-
transcriptional modifications, cellular localizations, and associated proteins to control circRNA functions. We
anticipate that the markers on circRNAs are distinct, which differentiate their roles and fates from their linear
RNA counterparts. Over the next five years, we will address how cells regulate the biological roles of circRNAs
by answering the following questions: 1) What are the types and levels of post-transcriptional modifications on
circRNAs? 2) Where do circRNAs move and reside in the cell? 3) What are the proteins associated with
circRNAs? We will compare circRNAs with their linear RNA counterparts to reveal whether and how cells use
RNA modifications, regional neighborhoods, and macromolecules to differentiate between RNAs with different
topologies that share the same primary sequence. We will employ technologies produced from our previous
work as well as molecular and chemical biology approaches. These investigations will produce deep insight
into post-transcriptional modifications on circRNAs, an atlas of circRNA cellular trafficking, and proteins
specifically associated with circRNAs. Together, the knowledge will establish a fundamental understanding of
how cells regulate the functions of circRNAs and distinguish between linear and circRNAs. The proposed
project dovetails well with my research group’s long-term vision, which is to illuminate the molecular basis for
circRNA functions on a global and single-molecule scale, so that we can address unmet needs in human
health."
10813758,"HIV persists in all treated individuals and in most cases viral rebound occurs promptly upon antiretroviral
treatment interruption (ATI). Tissues are major sites of HIV persistence during cART and, notably, the
gastrointestinal tract is the first site were rebound is detectable via SIV-end ImmunoPET/CT in a live SIV
infected animal upon ATI. However, a lot is still unknown about the mechanisms of viral persistence in tissues.
This is mostly because of logistical barriers in sampling deep tissues and the focal nature of HIV/SIV infection.
Our team has developed a sampling workflow based on ImmunoPET/CT signal that overcomes these
difficulties and allows sampling of areas of “rebound-competent reservoir” in tissues in a live animal. TGF-β is
an important immune suppressor factor, which orchestrates tissue immunity. Levels of TGF-β remain elevated
in HIV infected individuals even after years of fully suppressive cART and contribute to immune suppression as
well as to the development of non-AIDS-related, non-communicable disorders via pro-fibrotic mechanisms.
TGF-β inhibits TCR-driven T cell proliferation and the maturation and function of other immune cell subsets.
Importantly, TGF-β is currently being used to induce HIV latency in in vitro models with primary T cells. Our
preliminary data demonstrate that blocking TGF-β signaling in vivo favors HIV latency reversal especially in
tissues. Moreover, we found that TGF-β blockade stimulates SIV-specific immune responses and decreases
BCL-2 expression in memory T cells both in vivo and in vitro. These exciting new data support a view of TGF-β
as a critical factor in maintaining immune cells into a resting state mostly resistant to apoptosis. Hence, we
hypothesize that blocking TGF-β will not only increase the frequency of latency reversal events, but also
enhance the elimination of the viral reservoir by increasing its susceptibility to immune and viral-mediated cell
death. We will test this hypothesis by focusing on 3 specific aims. Aim 1 will be an investigation of the
mechanisms of TGF-β blockade in vivo. We will leverage PET/CT-guided sampling to obtain tissue areas
where virus reverses following TGF-β blockade and analyze the cells in these tissues for their transcriptomic
profiles in their own microenviroment. In Aim 2, we will dissect the mechanisms of TGF-β blockade ex vivo to
understand the pathways dependence of the effect of TGF-β blockade on HIV latency and on the survival
program of central memory T cells. Finally, in Aim 3, we will dissect the combination of TGF-β blockade and
PD-1 blockade on the differentiation program and apoptosis sensitivity of the cells harboring the viral reservoir
in vivo. In conclusion, we designed a comprehensive strategy that will help us understanding the potential of
this novel strategy to bring us closer to an HIV cure."
10880258,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Immunosuppressed transplant recipients have a 65-253 fold higher risk of developing cutaneous squamous
cell carcinoma (cSCC) and are contraindicated for treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors, presenting an
important unmet clinical need. The ability of T cells to constrain cSCC is demonstrated by the response of 32-
46% of immunocompetent patients to immune checkpoint inhibitors. However, cSCC has the potential to evade
an active T cell response as demonstrated by the formation of cSCC in immunocompetent patients and
resistance to immune checkpoint inhibition in some patients. Prior work suggests that evasion of an active T
cell response occurs through the process of immunoediting, in which T cells destroy tumors that present
mutated tumor proteins that bind the T cell receptor (neoantigens), and thus select for less immunogenic
tumors. This proposal will compare the neoantigen profile and immune escape mechanisms in tumors and
tumor-adjacent skin from immunosuppressed and immunocompetent individuals as a novel approach to
evaluate the role of T cells in immunoediting. Evaluating the neoantigen profile in carcinogen-exposed tumor-
adjacent skin will additionally provide evidence for immunoediting before the formation of a clinically apparent
lesion. Furthermore, since cSCC in immunosuppressed patients develops in the context of diminished T cell
function, this proposal tests the innovative concept that these patients will have a neoantigen profile that is
more amenable to treatment with a personalized neoantigen vaccine. The Hastings laboratory has created an
MHC class I neoantigen prioritization model with high accuracy in predicting neoantigens that elicit a T cell
response, which will be applied to evaluate the neoantigen profiles of cSCC from immunosuppressed and
immunocompetent individuals. The Hastings laboratory has also generated and characterized a solar-
simulated light induced, transplantable cSCC tumor that will be used to test vaccine efficacy in the proposed
studies. Preliminary data demonstrate that the cSCC transplantable model is constrained by T cells and
vaccination with irradiated tumor cells protects from tumor challenge. This proposal will test the central
hypothesis that cSCC and carcinogen-exposed, tumor-adjacent skin from immunosuppressed individuals will
have a more immunogenic neoantigen profile and less frequent immune escape mechanisms compared to
cSCC from immunocompetent individuals. Aim 1 of this proposal will compare the neoantigen profile and
immune escape mechanisms between immunosuppressed and immunocompetent patients. Aim 2 will
compare the neoantigen profile and immune escape mechanisms of cSCC from mice with and without a
functional T cell repertoire and demonstrate the efficacy of cancer vaccines in immunosuppressed mice. The
impact of the project is to provide evidence for neoantigen vaccines as an important treatment option for
immunosuppressed patients and systematically characterize the immune escape mechanisms in cSCC to
determine additional targets of therapy for cSCC in immunocompetent patients."
10902072,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The long-term goal of our research program is to decipher the molecular mechanism of “non-canonical” protein-
RNA interactions studying a particularly fascinating and disease-relevant family of proteins, called the La-related
protein (LARP) superfamily, on a molecular level. Cytoplasmic LARPs play a pivotal role in post-transcriptional
gene control by regulating the delicate balance between active translation, degradation, and storage of mRNAs.
Hence, many LARPs are intimately implicated in various cancers and fibroproliferative diseases rendering them
an important class of druggable targets. However, the development of therapies has been stunted by the lack of
detailed molecular-level information. Our research will elucidate the molecular mechanism of RNA recognition
exhibited by LARPs, in particular, to explain the intricacies of commonality and individuality, i.e. how their com-
mon RNA-binding motif, called the La-module, has individually evolved to allow specific RNA recognition and
thus achieve its distinct function. The investigation is based on our unique strength in solution and solid-state
NMR spectroscopy and their close coupling with other biochemical, biophysical, computational, and functional
approaches. Our initial efforts will follow two lines of inquiry, simultaneously focusing on two members of the
LARP superfamily, hLARP6 and hLARP1. In the first line of inquiry, we will explore how the La-module of hLARP6
achieves the exclusive recognition of the highly conserved 5' stem-loop (5'SL) motif, which is found in all verte-
brate mRNAs encoding type I collagens. This line of study will provide a detailed molecular-level map on how
individual elements of the La-module contribute to the specificity and affinity of 5'SL binding. The detailed insights
to be gained, together with currently available biochemical and biophysical data, will provide essential insights
into the molecular “symbiosis” of the individual elements of the La-module and close this critical gap in knowledge
required for the development of therapeutic strategies against fibroproliferative diseases. In the second line of
inquiry, we will analogously dissect how the La-module of hLARP1 recognizes a distinctly different type of RNA
compared to hLARP6. hLARP1 was found to be heavily involved in proliferation and cell cycle defects and to be
significantly upregulated in malignant cells and tissues. Very recent biochemical studies revealed that the La-
module of hLARP1 sequentially binds to the 3' poly(A) and then to the 5ʹ terminal oligopyrimidine (5ʹTOP) motifs
of mRNAs. Notably, this peculiar two-step behavior has not yet been observed for any other LARP. We will
uncover this unusual molecular mechanism by investigating the structural and dynamic changes of hLARP1
upon binding of the poly(A) and 5'TOP motifs. This study will for the first time reveal how the initial binding of
one RNA to its La-module elicits structural and dynamic changes required for the binding of a second RNA target.
Overall, these two lines of comparative investigations will synergistically lead us to understand the fundamental
principles that connect the co-evolution of the individual elements of the La-module and their specific role in RNA
recognition, thus explaining how structural and dynamic plasticity contribute to functional plasticity."

Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF) is the most common form of HF in the US and is
associated with high morbidity and mortality. However, its pathophysiology is incompletely understood, and
most trials have been neutral such that few evidence-based treatments exist. In response, NIH convened 2
workshops co-led by Dr. Kitzman (PI). The highest priority research recommendation was a coordinated effort
to create a large cohort of HFpEF patients and controls and perform comprehensive, deep phenotyping. This
became the basis for HeartShare, whose ultimate goals are to discover novel HFpEF mechanisms, subtypes,
and therapeutic targets. Our Wake Forest - Atrium HFpEF team is highly qualified to serve as a Clinical Center
and make robust, over-arching contributions to HeartShare. Dr. Kitzman is internationally recognized as a
thought-leader in HFpEF with a sustained track record of developing novel concepts regarding HFpEF
pathogenesis, mechanisms, and outcomes and designing and conducting innovative studies to test them. His
team has extensive experience in all key aspects of the HeartShare program, particularly in recruiting,
retaining, and phenotyping diverse populations of HFpEF patients and controls, often significantly exceeding
goals for racial and gender diversity. Our institutions have ~15,000 HFpEF clinical visits annually. In all, our
team has led or helped lead recruitment and phenotyping for 69 studies, mostly NIH-sponsored, with 15,354
participants, demonstrating our ability to fulfill HeartShare recruitment and phenotyping goals. Data from these
studies will be contributed to the Cohort phase of HeartShare. We will make robust contributions to HeartShare
by achieving 4 Specific Aims: Aim 1) Provide ‘thought leadership’ in collaboration with the HeartShare Steering
Committee; Aim 2) Contribute data, images, and stored specimens cohort phase of HeartShare from our
numerous studies of HFpEF and controls, and identify and phenotype HFpEF patients and controls from the
electronic health record using robust bioinformatics tools; Aim 3) Recruit, consent, enroll and follow at least
250 HFpEF patients plus controls (type and number to be determined by consensus); Aim 4) Conduct state-of-
the-art deep phenotyping exams using a collaboratively determined protocol. Our phenotyping proposal is
highly innovative, with advanced echo-Doppler and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, CPET, physical
activity monitoring, remote and artificial intelligence electrocardiography, sampling of skeletal muscle, adipose,
blood, and microbiome, and mitochondrial energetics, and brain structure/function. Our diverse, cross-
disciplinary team has the full range of complementary expertise and access to the robust resources of two
large, closely affiliated health systems to ensure fulfillment of all HeartShare’s goals. We will help accelerate
and optimize the program’s success with our insight, creativity, and sustained track record of collaboration,
innovation, and dissemination."

This is Mayo Clinic’s application to participate in the NIH HeartShare Research Consortium as a HeartShare
Clinical Center (CC). Our goal is to collaborate with the other HeartShare Investigators to elucidate the
pathophysiology of heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and discover novel diagnostic
and therapeutic approaches. Multiple pathophysiologic processes may ultimately lead to different HFpEF
phenotypes, though the specific mechanisms remain largely undefined. It is also not known whether standard
clinical information can identify patients with different mechanistic etiologies, which is necessary to provide
targeted therapies in clinical trials and eventually in clinical practice. Our proposal outlines four specific aims. In
Specific Aim 1: We document that Mayo Clinic has the resources and the Mayo HeartShare Team has the
expertise and track record of productivity in HFpEF and relevant related diseases, clinical research, patient
recruitment and retention, data science, and collaborative team science to help drive the success of
HeartShare Network. In Specific Aim 2: We propose a broad mechanistic phenotyping protocol providing
quantitative variables reflective of senescence, systemic disease processes, and multi-organ integrity (L2
data), which are used as input variables in unsupervised machine learning (ML) models. We hypothesize that
this approach will allow identification of unique HFpEF pathophysiologic phenogroups (clusters). We also
propose invasive hemodynamic signatures, trans-cardiac gradients of circulating biomarkers and myocardial,
adipose and skeletal muscle tissue characterization (L3 data) be obtained in a subset within each HFpEF
pathophysiologic phenogroup. We hypothesize these L3 data will enhance identification of targeted therapeutic
strategies. Lastly, we outline supervised ML using EHR data to develop automatable algorithms to accurately
identify the HeartShare HFpEF pathophysiological phenogroups derived using L2 data. We hypothesize that if
successful, this approach will enhance translation of HeartShare findings by allowing automated identification
of patients in the different HFpEF phenogroups for enrollment in clinical trials of agents targeting their specific
pathophysiology. In Specific Aim 3: We propose that use of circulating proteins alone (n=5000; defined by the
SOMAScanTM Aptamer based platform) as input variables for unsupervised ML models will identify unique
HFpEF pathophysiologic phenotypes (clusters). In Specific Aim 4: We outline the Mayo HeartShare Research
Skills Development Program. Providing HFpEF clinical investigators a short-term intensive immersion
experience by collaboration with a data scientist intern in the Mayo Cardiovascular Disease AI Internship or
a long term dedicated program in data science as a Mayo Kern Center Scholar in Data Science will equip a
new generation of HFpEF investigators with a robust data science toolbox to drive future discovery."
10927315,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Prostate cancer will claim lives of over 30,000 American men in 2020 alone. The disease evolves from primary
tumors to castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), which only takes around 2-3 years. CRPC is still driven
by androgens such as testosterone which is why anti-androgen drugs are widely used to treat the disease.
These drugs include enzalutamide (XTANDI®), abiraterone acetate (ZYTIGA®) and apalutamide
(ERLEADA™). Although these drugs are highly effective initially, patients often quickly develop resistant
disease to these drugs. Therefore, there is an urgent need to find strategies that control the emergence of anti-
androgen resistant prostate cancer. Researchers have shown that drug resistant CRPC often occurs due to
expression of a variant form of receptor called androgen receptor variant-7 (AR-V7). This receptor can be
activated independent of androgen. Data from my group shows that protein degrading enzyme (STUB1) and its
chaperone protein (HSP70) are altered in resistant CRPC cells. This HSP70/STUB1 complex is a critical
regulator of protein stability/half-life. We found that HSP70/STUB1 is responsible for AR/AR-V7 proteins
homeostasis (proteostasis) and remaining active for long periods. We have shown that modulating the
HSP70/STUB1 complex with a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug used for parasite infection
namely, niclosamide, reduces the levels of AR-V7 and importantly resensitizes resistant prostate cancer to
anti-androgen therapy. However, niclosamide has a poor characteristic that is hard to reach satisfied
concentration in blood as a cancer therapeutic. To address this, we modified niclosamide to yield a range of
potent HSP70/STUB1 modulators (HSMs) and one of the small molecule compounds known as HSM-7, which
has a better bio-distribution profile and superior effects on killing drug resistant prostate tumors. The
overarching goal of this application is to develop HSMs and build a strong rationale for translating the drug to
the clinic to treat patients with lethal CRPC disease. In this project, we will study HSM-7 on its regulation of
HSP70/STUB1/AR-V7 ternary complex which will be critical to strategize to overcome anti-androgen resistance.
We will discover the multiplicity targets regulated by HSMs through HSP70/STUB1 machinery and dissect how
ubiquitination alteration by HSMs treatment controls oncogenic protein turnover. Additionally, we will evaluate
the drug properties of HSM-7 and test its efficacy in novel patient tumor derived animal and cell models of
CRPC for future clinical trial initiation. The outcomes of the proposed studies will provide a strong rationale for
translating HSM-7 into the clinical setting and in addressing the major unmet need of overcoming next
generation anti-androgen resistance in CRPC patients. We believe that HSM-7 will ultimately increase the
overall survival and improve the quality of life men diagnosed with CRPC."

There are approximately 680,000 adolescent and young adult cancer survivors (AYACS) in the U.S., and the
survival rate in this group is increasing. AYACS experience a myriad of deleterious treatment-related side
effects, higher rates of physical and emotional problems and are at a heighted risk of early morbidity and
mortality compared to non-cancer age-matched controls. Increased moderate to vigorous intensity physical
activity (MVPA) is consistently associated with enhanced quality of life (QOL), reduced cancer treatment-
related side effects and chronic disease risk, and improved cancer prognosis in cancer survivors. Yet, the
majority of AYACS (~60%) do not meet cancer-specific MVPA recommendations (i.e., 150 mins/week), and
very little research on MVPA in cancers survivors has focused specifically on AYACS. Existing studies of
MVPA in survivors are largely resource-intensive, costly, and deliver multiple components (i.e., coaching calls,
supervised exercise) simultaneously limiting scalability. Three evidence-based strategies have been identified
that may be particularly useful for overcoming these barriers and increasing MVPA in AYACS: 1) electronic
delivery of a MVPA program, 2) social support, and 3) mindfulness training. However, little is known on the
unique roles of social support and mindfulness in MVPA promotion. More granular information about the
discrete effects of these components is needed to optimize intervention configuration in order to maximize an
effective and scalable MVPA program for AYACS. The purpose of this study is to apply the Multiphase
Optimization Strategy (MOST), to determine which types of social support and mindfulness training
intervention components optimally increase MVPA in a 12-week mHealth MVPA intervention with a 12 week
follow-up. MOST is a framework adapted from engineering that uses highly efficient factorial experiments to
evaluate individual, and combined, effects of intervention components to determine which ones can be
reduced, eliminated or replaced to improve efficiency. Inactive AYACS (n=304) will receive a core intervention
consisting of the OPTIMAL AYAO app and Fitbit and be randomly assigned to 4 components under
consideration for inclusion in the optimized intervention: 1) general mindfulness training; 2) MVPA specific
mindfulness training; 3) e-coach and 4) engagement of a buddy. We will also examine the effects of increasing
MVPA on symptom burden, intensities of other activities (i.e. light and sedentary), and sleep quality and
duration and potential mediators and moderators of component effects. The proposed study represents the first
systematic effort to use MOST to design an optimized, scalable mHealth MVPA intervention for AYACS. This
study will lead to an improved understanding of how to effectively change AYACS' MVPA and ultimately,
improve health and disease outcomes in this population."

Age-related bone loss puts individuals at risk for debilitating osteoporotic fractures. Current osteoporosis
therapies primarily target bone-resorbing osteoclasts to prevent further bone loss; however, because of the
coupling of osteoclasts and osteoblasts, these therapies are limited by a concomitant decrease in bone
formation. Thus, new treatments are needed to reduce bone loss while protecting or stimulating new bone
formation. Osteoclasts are multinucleated cells derived from the myeloid lineage. While most well-known for
bone resorption, osteoclasts exhibit a range of functions, including stimulating bone formation by osteoblasts
(coupling activity). Increasing evidence shows that osteoclasts exhibit functional heterogeneity. Our data
presented herein confirm that not all osteoclasts are actively resorbing or coupling, and others have documented
heterogeneity in osteoclast resorptive activity itself. With aging, there is a shift in osteoclast functional distribution,
with an increase in the percentage of actively resorbing osteoclasts and a decrease in osteoclasts positive for
coupling factor expression. Aging also leads to an increase in an aggressive subpopulation of osteoclasts, which
move while resorbing bone leading to trench formation. Our data support that these aggressive, trench-forming
osteoclasts, which exhibit greater acidification of the resorption lacunae and increased protease activity, have
impaired ability to recruit osteoprogenitors to sites of resorption. Therefore, we hypothesize that the increase in
aggressive, trench-forming osteoclasts with age is linked to reduced osteoclast coupling activity, leading to
overall bone loss. To test this hypothesis, we propose to 1) Determine whether inducible activation of osteoclast
coupling activity prevents age-related bone loss.; 2) Evaluate whether differential osteoclast resorptive
behaviors impact coupling; and 3) Test the role of matrix-derived TGF-β as a feedback mechanism to
modulate osteoclast activity. Altogether, these studies will reveal the distribution of osteoclast behaviors and
how these are dysregulated during aging. In addition, understanding the mechanisms by which changes in
resorption contribute to altered coupling activity will reveal potential new therapeutic targets for shifting osteoclast
activities to treat osteoclast-mediated bone disease."

 Hispanics in the United States face health disparities for obesity and related medical conditions, such as
cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Targeting families to promote healthy lifestyle behaviors has been
identified as an effective strategy to prevent obesity. With the importance of familism (family cohesion) among
the Hispanic population, a family based intervention is especially desirable as an engaging strategy to promote
behaviors that support a healthy weight status and decrease obesity related health disparities for Hispanics.
Emerging evidence supports the need to include and target fathers in family based lifestyle behavior
interventions. However, to date mothers have almost exclusively been reached by such efforts in the US.
Healthy Dads Healthy Kids (HDHK) is an evidence based program developed in Australia, shown to have
significant weight and behavior treatment effects for fathers and their children, compared to controls. The
HDHK program is based on Social Cognitive Theory and Family Systems Theory and aims to promote
increased physical activity and improved dietary intake for fathers and their children. An important innovation in
the program is that fathers and children attend together and are both targeted as agents of behavior change for
each other (reciprocal reinforcement) and to participate in fun, family activities together. HDHK was culturally
adapted for Hispanic families following the Ecological Validity Model by this research team, with input from a
community Hispanic family panel, expert committee and the developer of the HDHK program. The resulting
Papás Saludables, Niños Saludables (PSNS) program was tested for feasibility in a waitlist controlled RCT
among 36 Hispanic families, whose child was a Texas Children’s Health Plan member. The findings support
testing the culturally adapted program in a family randomized group trial with a standard of care comparison/
control for efficacy. The proposed efficacy trial is powered to detect a clinically meaningful change in father’s
weight and children’s physical activity. The study will also assess other behavioral (dietary intake, sedentary
time, screen media use, and parenting practices), psychosocial (familism, acculturation, and co-parenting
alliance) and biological (non-HDL, HgbA1C, BP) outcomes. Partnership with the YMCA of Greater Houston
offers a venue for where to deliver the program, and partnership with Texas Children’s Health Plan provides
access to over 80,000 Hispanic children between the ages from 5-11 from which to recruit. The RE-AIM
framework will inform a detailed process evaluation to assess barriers and facilitators to implementing PSNS
with our community partners in the future. This novel lifestyle program can provide a paradigm shift for how
obesity prevention for Hispanic children should be conceptualized, by directly engaging Hispanic fathers, which
has not been done to date."

Sapovirus (SaV), a genus in the Caliciviridae family alongside norovirus, is increasingly recognized as an
important cause of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) in childhood. SaV ranked second among all enteric pathogens in
its contribution to AGE incidence in children under 24 months of age in a large multi-site birth cohort study and
was associated with lower cognitive development scores. While vaccines against rotavirus have lowered the
burden of childhood AGE and a pediatric norovirus vaccine will be entering Phase III trials, currently, there are
no vaccines against SaV. A major challenge to SaV vaccine development is that there is little known about
natural immunity to serve as a guide for vaccine-elicited immunity. For other enteric viruses, such as rotavirus
and norovirus, virus-specific IgA Abs in serum, saliva, and feces have been associated with protection against
disease or decreased viral load after challenge. While mucosal Abs likely also play an important role in protection
against this enteric pathogen, we are unaware of any published studies reporting on humoral immunity to SaV
in saliva or stool or IgA responses to SaV in any compartment, likely due to the challenge in obtaining sapovirus
antigens. Our ongoing epidemiological studies of SaV show that reinfection with the same genotype is
uncommon, suggesting the development of genotype-specific immunity. Heterotypic infections do occur,
although they lessen with age. Our interdisciplinary team is uniquely poised to substantially advance the
understanding of natural humoral immunity to sapovirus with our platform for field epidemiology research in
Nicaragua and state-of-the-art laboratory techniques to elucidate memory B cell repertoires. Building on an NIH-
funded birth cohort of 444 children in León, Nicaragua, this project aims to characterize the kinetics of humoral
immunity to sapovirus in longitudinal serum, saliva, and stool samples collected from 67 children experiencing a
SaV gastroenteritis episode during the first two years of life. In addition, we will correlate these responses in
different compartments and compare responses elicited by symptomatic vs. asymptomatic infections and in first
vs. subsequent infections. In addition, we will use peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected 28 days after
first SaV infections to reveal important immune phenotypes and produce stable populations of memory B cells
to clone monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Using our unique resource of a panel of sapovirus antigens representing
the common circulating genotypes, we will investigate the breadth of SaV-specific antibodies produced from
natural infections. Together, this unique collaboration allows us to exchange analytic tools to better understand
the immunology of sapovirus in children. Specifically, this project will generate new data that are fundamental
for the advancement of control and prevention interventions, including pediatric sapovirus vaccines."
10848443,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The mammalian respiratory system undergoes cyclical mechanical strain as part of its normal function. Lungs
have evolved to be flexible to adapt to this strain, which involves rhythmic inflation and deflation of the alveoli for
efficient gas exchange. Multiple cell lineages comprise the alveolar niche including alveolar type 1 (AT1) and
alveolar type 2 (AT2) epithelial cells as well as various unique mesenchymal and endothelial cell types. AT1 cells
are required for efficient gas exchange across the endothelial capillary plexus while AT2 cells generate
pulmonary surfactant and act as facultative progenitors that differentiate into AT1 cells. While most studies on
mechanotransduction have focused on the response of mesenchymal lineages, the ability of epithelial cells, in
particular those within the lung alveoli, to respond to and maintain their identity and function in the face of this
continuous and rhythmic biomechanical strain has not been well defined. Using multiple genetic and biophysical
approaches, we present new preliminary data demonstrating that loss of cytoskeletal-extracellular matrix
interactions via genetic, mechanical and chemical perturbations in AT1cells, leads to their rapid reprogramming
into AT2 cells in vivo. Single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) analysis shows that these reprogrammed AT2 cells are
very similar to normal AT2 cells. Loss of AT1 cell fate is accompanied by coordinate changes in lamina-
associated chromatin domain (LAD) organization, causing sequestration or release of AT1 or AT2 specific loci
located in LAD sat the nuclear periphery. This phenomenon inversely correlates to the changes in alveolar
epithelial cell fate. Importantly, we have developed a novel model of unilateral mechanical unloading of the
cyclical strain from breathing movements in the lungs and show that this causes a profound reprogramming of
AT1 into AT2 cells. In agreement with these new Preliminary Data, our laboratories recently demonstrated that
Yap/Taz are found in the nucleus of AT1, but not AT2cells, and are essential for maintaining AT1 cell fate
throughout the lifespan of mice. Loss of Yap/Taz results in a rapid reprogramming of AT1 cells into AT2 cells in
the absence of injury. Since Yap/Taz can function as cytoplasmic mechanotransducers in cells and translocate
to the nucleus upon actin-regulated cell stretch and strain, our combined preliminary and published data suggest
that mechanotransduction plays a specific role in AT1cells to maintain alveolar function in the homeostatic lung.
Thus, our published and preliminary data raise a provocative hypothesis that the lung has evolved specific
epigenetic and transcriptional mechanisms to maintain cellular fate in the face of mechanical strain from normal
respiration and these pathways are altered in the response to injury and disease. This proposal brings together
two complementary laboratories with extensive experience in the study of lung development, epigenetic control
of cell fate, and the inherent implications for regeneration and disease and we aim to address key unanswered
questions in cell fate regulation in lung development and regeneration."

The loss of function following an amputation is profound and life altering. To date, interventions to improve long
term functional abilities and limit detrimental secondary injuries (e.g. osteoarthritis) have not been effective.
While multifactorial, the effect of altered muscle quality, specifically of the quadriceps, on functional outcomes
for individuals with transtibial amputation is poorly understood. Work by our group in other conditions shows
that muscle quality changes after injury and is directly related to loss of function, including protracted strength
deficits. My long-term career goal is to combine my background in bioengineering with the skills developed
through this F32 training grant to develop novel therapeutic strategies and devices to improve function and
quality of life for individuals with lower limb loss. This training award will allow me to 1) assess the muscle
quality of the thigh of the intact and residual limbs with novel magnetic resonance imaging sequences, 2)
predict the relationship between thigh muscle quality and muscle strength, and finally 3) characterize the
relationship between muscle quality, muscle strength, and knee joint loading for individuals with transtibial
amputation. Muscle quality will be assessed using novel magnetic resonance imaging techniques including
T1rho mapping and diffusion tensor imaging. These techniques will provide new insights on the muscle tissue
morphology, including any increases in fibrotic tissue or decreases in pennation angle and fiber tract length,
that affect the muscle's overall ability to function properly and efficiently. To evaluate muscle strength and
mobility, participants will complete maximum voluntary isometric knee flexion and validated surveys targeting
self-reported mobility. Finally, joint contact forces of the intact limb will be assessed through a computational
musculoskeletal model. Through the work proposed for this NRSA F32, I will refine and gain skills critical for a
successful career as an independent translational researcher seeking to collaborate with clinician scientists.
Training will include skills development in medical imaging acquisition and analysis, clinically relevant strength
assessment, instrumented motion analysis, musculoskeletal modeling, clinical research management, and
statistical analysis. Including in the training plan are accessory career development activities including related
course work (e.g. biomechanics, statistics, medical imaging), grant writing workshops, opportunities for
research dissemination, and mentorship that will all be key components to developing a well-rounded skill set
for a future academic career. My selected sponsor, institution, and mentors will provide the perfect
environment for encouraging success."

The overarching goal of the UC Davis Paul Calabresi K12 Clinical Oncology Research Career Development
Program (CDP) is to nurture clinician or basic/translational junior faculty to become independent, patient-
oriented cancer researchers who are highly trained in translational, team-driven research. Using 1) core
competencies, 2) advanced oncology coursework, 3) career development, 4) mentored research, and 5) cross-
discipline exposure, the CDP provides two new scholars per year (six at any one time) a three-year career
development program aimed at honing ideas and skills that go far beyond their initial disciplinary boundaries.
Scholars will overcome language and cultural barriers that typically exist between clinical and
basic/translational researchers, take advantage of the collaborative research environment at UC Davis,
participate in multidisciplinary and translational forums, and gather essential skills in research design, clinical
trial development, team science, grant writing, ethical conduct of research, communication, and career
development. The vision is to enhance translational research by training physician-scientists to incorporate and
utilize basic/correlative science in their pursuit of clinical trials (""Clinical Track""), and conversely, driving basic
scientists towards patient-driven drug development and clinical research (""Basic/Translational Track""). To
maintain the emphasis on patient-driven clinical research, CDP scholars, under the mentorship of both a
clinical mentor and basic/translational mentor, will be required to develop and initiate/conduct their own
investigator-initiated clinical trial during the training period. The program will leverage the outstanding research,
training, and evaluation expertise and infrastructure of the NCI-designated UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer
Center, NCATS-funded Clinical and Translational Research Center (CTSC), and School of Medicine Career
Development Program. It will be overseen and enhanced by a highly organized internal Oversight Committee
and external Advisory Board. Overall, the CDP seeks to accomplish the following specific aims: 1) Offer a
competency-based didactic curriculum to promote team science, encourage translational research, and hone
essential skills for clinical trial development and career/research success; 2) Oversee individualized patient-
oriented research projects customized to the interests and needs of each scholar; and 3) Provide oversight of
scholar training to ensure the progressive development of fully competent interdisciplinary researchers who
can successfully conduct cancer clinical trials. These specific aims will build a critical mass of trained scientists
at the forefront of innovative, impactful, evidence-based research, who can oversee projects encompassing the
entire continuum of research from basic science (target identification and drug discovery) through translational
science (drug development and correlative science) to clinical investigation. By doing so, we offer the potential
of enhancing the success of clinician scientists and improving outcomes for cancer patients."
10896159,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
To improve diagnostic yield for rare diseases, we developed the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) in 2008 as
a comprehensive bioinformatic resource that provides a standardized terminology of phenotypic abnormalities
for the analysis of human diseases. HPO reduces ambiguity in disease descriptions—thus enabling more robust
differential diagnosis and clinical care—and enables phenotypic contextualization of genomic data for
diagnostics and precision medicine.
The performance of computational algorithms for differential diagnostics with HPO terms depends critically on
the comprehensiveness and depth of HPO annotations for diseases. However, the current manual nature of our
biocuration process has limited the quality, depth, and coverage of these annotations. Therefore, this proposal's
objectives are to greatly expand the corpus of disease-phenotype annotations by automating portions of the
curation and expanding the computational disease model.
This project, HPO: Accelerating Computational Integration of Clinical Data for Genomics, will maintain and
advance HPO resources to address the needs of a growing number of medical disciplines that have adopted the
HPO. We will achieve this goal by 1) automating HPO development, maintenance, and release processes, 2)
developing representations of rare disease treatments and interventions, and 3) extending our current
computational disease models to represent time course, sex biases, and frequency of events, and to incorporate
case report data. We also provide a sustainable solution to community contribution with a user-friendly, web-
based portal to enable contributors to vet and suggest improvements to the ontology and the annotations and
grow the HPO contributor community.
In summary, our project addresses the most pressing needs for advancements of the HPO to ensure sustainable,
robust, and rigorous development, to enable HPO resources to support new communities, new applications, and
more medical disciplines."
10891575,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Orofacial clefts are among the most common congenital conditions in the U.S., occurring in approximately one
in every 800 births. Children with cleft palate with or without cleft lip (CP±L) require interdisciplinary care from
infancy through adulthood to improve speech, facial appearance, and physical and psychosocial health. Cleft-
related treatments are burdensome for affected children and their families, and lifetime healthcare costs are
estimated at nearly $700 million U.S. dollars annually. Treatment guidelines for children CP± L are primarily
based on clinical expertise and provide wide latitude in the types and timing of assessments and interventions.
Although the American Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Association recommends that all cleft teams include a
psychosocial professional to address the mental health, quality of life, emotional, behavioral, and social needs
of children with CP±L, the types of services vary greatly across centers. In addition, it remains unknown which
children with CP±L are at greatest risk for poor health and psychosocial outcomes and which demographic
(e.g., race), medical (e.g., cleft type, timing of diagnosis) and contextual factors (e.g., caregiver stress)
contribute to these risks. Consequently, there is limited evidence to inform the provision of timely and effective
interventions to support the long-term mental and physical health of children with CP±L and their families. This
project will address this gap by partnering with The Cleft Palate Registry/Research Outcomes Network
(CORNET; NIDCR R01DE02749). CORNET is the largest U.S. prospective study in cleft care to date and
focuses on surgical and speech outcomes (pre-palate repair through 3 years of age) in a cohort of infants (N =
1514) with CP±L across 16 geographically diverse cleft centers. Leveraging CORNET and an interdisciplinary
team of investigators with expertise in cleft care outcomes, we propose to evaluate psychosocial and health
outcomes in young children with CP±L and their caregivers through two new studies: 1) a cross-sectional study
[N = 500] of medical and demographic factors predictive of health and psychosocial outcomes; and 2) a
longitudinal, mixed methods study [N = 200] to evaluate contextual predictors of psychosocial and health
outcomes over time. Specific aims include: 1) examine associations between medical and demographic factors
and health (growth/BMI) and psychosocial outcomes (child health-related quality of life, adjustment) in children
ages 2-5 years enrolled in CORNET; 2) prospectively assess the impact of contextual risk and protective
factors on health and psychosocial outcomes over time (at baseline/pre-palate surgery, 24 months, and 36
months of age); and 3) qualitatively evaluate caregiver perceptions of health and psychosocial outcomes and
treatment experiences over time through narrative interviews with 40 caregivers. Data from this study will
elucidate early predictors of poor and optimal outcome trajectories and inform both the type and timing of
interventions to ensure that all children born with CP±L achieve optimal health and well-being."
11177209,"Our goal is to develop towards an IND a novel class of small molecule inhibitors of phosphoinositide (PI) 4
kinase IIIb (PI4KIIIb) with potent dual activity against both SARS-CoV-2 and the excess cytokine release
associated with COVID-19 disease. Entry of SARS-CoV has been shown to depend on PI4KIIIb, and strong
inhibition of entry was achieved following knockdown of PI4KIIIb via siRNA, and SARS-CoV-2 is believed to
enter cells via a similar mechanism. This likely reflects a requirement for enrichment of phosphorylated
isoforms of PI, such as PI-4, in the lipid organelle required for viral fusion upon entry. We have developed
potent and specific small molecule inhibitors of PI4KIIIb, and optimized them for high oral bioavailability. Our
lead inhibitor, STF-1019 has nanomolar efficacy against enteroviruses (EV) which are also dependent on
PI4KIIIb, and is the only molecule to have demonstrated in vivo efficacy in the animal model of EV-71, and
without toxicity. We have now shown that STF-1019’s EC50 against SARS-CoV-2 is 210 nM, with a CC50 of
>100 microM, reflecting a therapeutic index (TI) of ~500. Finally, likely due to PI4KIIIb’s role in Golgi-mediated
secretion, we have also recently shown that STF-1019 can potently inhibit the LPS-induced secretion of IL-6
from human PBMC. STF-1019’s metabolic stability, however, is suboptimal, requiring co-administration with an
inhibitor (i.e. ritonavir) of its metabolism by CYP3A4 for optimal sustained tissue exposure. We hypothesize
that: 1) STF-1019’s SAR and major metabolites indicates that our lead PI4KIIIb inhibitor can be further
optimized to increase its activity and metabolic stability to achieve an optimal exposure profile; 2) modifications
that further increase PI4KIIIb inhibition can provide a buffer for modifications that may increase metabolic
stability at the expense of efficacy; 3) the optimized inhibitor will inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, and in vivo; 4) the
optimized inhibitor will have a high barrier to the development of resistance; 5) because of its orthogonal
mechanism of action, our PI4KIIIb inhibitor can be used in combination with other agents to maximize efficacy;
6) STF-1019’s inhibition of IL-6 reflects an ability to modulate the release of other cytokines, and this non-
antiviral activity can be of great additional benefit in addressing the cytokine storm associated with severe
COVID-19 infection; 7) determination of key pharmacokinetic, in vitro ADME-Tox parameters and initial
preclinical in vivo toxicity assessment of our optimized lead can advance its translational development, and
form the basis of a future IND package. We propose the test these hypotheses by: 1) Identifying the STF-1019
analog (and back-up compound) with greatest in vivo trough:EC90 ratios; 2) determining the in vivo activity of
the optimized PI4KIIIb inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 and their effect on cytokine production; 3) determining
the relative barrier to resistance, and potential for synergy with other agents; and 4) nominating a PI4KIIIb
inhibitor IND candidate by subjecting the optimized lead to initial in vitro ADME-tox and IND-enabling
preclinical animal safety studies."
10907569,"PROJECT SUMMARY
At birth, it is critical that an infant begins breathing quickly. The infant has to switch from relying on the placenta
for oxygen to using its lungs for the first time. Worldwide each year, 10 million babies do not breathe immediately
at birth, and approximately one million babies die annually in low and middle-income countries due to a brain
injury caused by inadequate blood flow and oxygen delivery to the neonatal brain, a condition known as hypoxic
ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). The usual practice for infants who need resuscitation is to immediately clamp
the umbilical cord. Animal studies show that clamping the cord before the baby breathes can cause the heart
beat to slow and can decrease the amount of blood being pumped out of the heart each minute. We propose a
study to see if umbilical cord milking (UCM) for those infants who need resuscitation is better than immediately
clamping and cutting the umbilical cord at birth. We wonder if it will reduce death and/or HIE. In addition, it may
reduce developmental problems in survivors by two years of age. This study is important because when there is
need for resuscitation, neither UCM or delayed cord clamping, are recommended by national and international
organizations due to lack of evidence. Yet, several large studies fromaround the world have identified that infants
needing resuscitation are more likely to die or develop conditions such as cerebral palsy, autism and other
developmental problems. The large amount of fetal blood left in the placenta after immediate cord clamping
means that the baby gets less blood for the brain, lungs, and heart, which can contribute, to brain injury and
even death. Cord milking at birth may help to protect these infants by increasing the transfer of blood volume.
Our prior work has shown that, compared to immediate cord clamping, UCM results in better heart rate, blood
pressure, less early anemia, and more oxygen in the brain. No harm from UCM has been noted in term infants
in any studies.
We will use a design in which each hospital will be randomly assigned to use either immediate cord clamping or
UCM for any infant needing resuscitation over a period of 6 months. Then sites will change to the other method
for an additional 6 months. This trial will involve 3442 term newborns who are depressed at birth at seven (7)
hospitals in India. This trial will provide evidence to promote a change in guidelines supporting the use of UCM
– a simple, no-cost intervention as standard of care in term and near-term newborns needing resuscitation."

This training program is unique for our institution, creating the next generation of basic and clinical investigators
who focus their efforts on strategic and comprehensive drug discovery and development in cancer. This program
capitalizes on a strong infrastructure and institutional commitment to the training of graduate student trainees for
careers in pediatric and adult drug discovery and development. The addition of a pediatric cancer focus
addresses an unmet need as well as a major focus of NCI as determined by the NCI's board of scientific
advisors and the resulting Childhood Cancer Data (CCDI) initiative. The wealth of adult experience and pediatric
researchers is uniquely being used in this T32 to develop novel approaches in pediatric drug discovery. There
are no current NCI T32s with an emphasis on both pediatric and adult cancer drug discovery and development
training. Cancer remains the leading cause of disease-related death in children. For the many children who
experience relapses of their malignant solid tumors curative treatment options are scarce. The pediatric efforts
will dovetail with the multi-institutional “Developmental and HyperActive Ras Tumor (DHART)” SPORE led by
multi-PI Dr. Wade Clapp focusing on neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)—the most common human genetic cancer
predisposition syndrome. Findings in this SPORE have led to new clinical trials for pediatric patients, and it is
anticipated additional new drugs will need to be developed that is beyond the scope of the SPORE. In addition,
the NIH/NICHD-funded P50, “Specialized Centers in Research in Pediatric Developmental Pharmacology” is
using precision genomics strategies and in vivo modeling to design efficacious and safe combination therapies
for relapsed solid tumors such as osteosarcoma and additional new targets for potential drug development are
being identified. This highlights our focus and opportunity to identify new drug targets and develop new drugs
specifically for pediatric patients. This program will be supported by collaborative efforts from other programs at
the IU School of Medicine (IUSM) including the NCI designated IU Simon Comprehensive Cancer Center
(IUSCCC); the Cancer Drug Discovery and Development (CDDD) center which is embedded in the IUSCCC
Experimental and Developmental Therapeutics (EDT) program; the TaRget Engagement to Accelerate Therapy
Development for Alzheimer's Disease (TREAT-AD) Center and the Indiana CTSI Preclinical Innovation “Think

programs that oversee graduate student recruitment and guide trainees in selecting mentors and home
departments. These two programs are the Indiana BioMedical Gateway (IBMG) program, which enrolls ~36
graduate students per year and MSTP which enrolls ~10 per year. Eighteen mentors are intimately involved in
this program and drug development efforts at the school. The goal of PACT-D3 is focused on grooming the next
generation of diverse, basic, and translational researchers with interests in pediatric and adult cancer drug

develop overt T2D. These metabolites were elevated up to 12 years before the onset of T2D in individuals who
were initially glucose-tolerant; improved prediction of T2D beyond clinical risk factors and established
biochemical markers; and have been validated by other groups. We have now extended our studies to
participants in the Jackson Heart Study (JHS), an African American (AA) population with a high prevalence of
T2D and its complications. We have also tested the predictive value of metabolites in a key clinical trial, the
Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP).
Our renewal will leverage critical advances made during the first 12 years of this award. Beyond the named
metabolites that we have associated with incident T2D, our recent “whole metabolome” analyses of T2D and
related traits in JHS have nominated hundreds of unknown compounds that are uncorrelated with existing
biochemical markers for unambiguous identification. We will use novel, in-house mass spectrometry (MS) and
bioinformatics tools to unambiguously identify these compounds. To complement the MS work, genome wide
association studies (GWAS) and genetic correlation analyses of metabolites and proteins will be used to
assign metabolite peaks to pathways (e.g., based on association with known metabolites or with enzymes or
solute carriers) that inform their identity. Finally, fine mapping of metabolite-associated genetic variants, co-
localization studies with established T2D-associated variants, and Mendelian Randomization experiments will
be used to assess causality of metabolite-associated variants for T2D. Putative causal variants that emerge
from these analyses will be validated in model systems, using techniques that are well established in our
laboratory as well as novel approaches.
In Specific Aim 1, we will establish the identity of unknown metabolite peaks that are associated with T2D and
related traits, using state-of-the-art mass spectrometry, and informed by GWAS and genetic correlation
analyses. In Specific Aim 2, we will refine the genetic architecture of metabolites associated with T2D and
related traits (fasting glucose, insulin, lipids, HbA1c, and HOMA-IR) in multi-ethnic cohorts and test whether the
likely causal variants are also risk variants for T2D and these same traits. In Specific Aim 3, we will functionally
examine key metabolite-related variants in model systems. We will use both gain- and loss-of-function
approaches to recapitulate metabolite profiles seen in humans and test for effects on key metabolic functions
(e.g., insulin release) in metabolically active tissues (e.g., pancreas). Initial studies will focus on the novel T2D
biomarker, ACY-1, a circulating enzyme most highly expressed by the liver which cleaves endogenous N-
acetylated amino acids to their free circulating forms. All data from this multi-institutional collaboration will be
made publicly available in real time for the entire scientific community."
10918124,"Project Summary Abstract
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the most common malignancy worldwide and has a high mortality rate. In
spite of advances in our understanding of the genetics and immunology of CRC, it remains largely resistant to
therapy. Colonization of the large intestine by oral microbes is common among healthy individuals. Many of these
commensals have pathophysiological effects in CRC patients. However, their mechanism of action is unclear.
Our recent study identified Parvimonas micra as the most enriched oral bacteria in CRC patient stool and colon
mucosa relative to healthy individuals. Networks of P. micra and other oral commensal in the stool of CRC
patients excluded protective commensals. Changes in DNA methylation of a set of cardinal genes in the colon
mucosa and blood of the patients predicted CRC risk. Transfer of CRC stool to germ free mice that were treated
with AOM resulted in DNA methylation of the host and formation of aberrant crypt foci, over and above that
observed with transfer of microbiota from healthy individuals. We provided preliminary data that P. micra can
directly methylate human colon tumor cells when co-cultured together under hypoxic conditions. On the basis
of these findings we hypothesize that oral commensals exemplified by Parvimonas alter DNA methylation
of host DNA to adapt to tumors and promote CRC. We will address this in two Specific Aims. 1. We will test
the hypothesis that in mouse models of spontaneous CRC, P. micra alters DNA methylation and expression of
host genes that affect CRC tumor growth and tumor associate immunity. Mice prone to spontaneous CRC will
get healthy human microbiota with or without P. micra, or L. acidophilus for comparison. Reduced representation
bisulfite sequencing (RRBS), ATACseq, RNAseq, immune assays, and histopathology will determine how
changes in DNA methylation impacts, (1) the growth and invasion of CRC tumors, (2) tumor associated
inflammation and immune response, (3) microbial community composition of the tumor mucosa and stool. 2. We
will test the hypothesis that P. micra and bacterial community networks regulate tumor growth and immune
response in CRC by altering DNA methylation of host cells. To test this we will, (1) Identify clusters of fecal and
tissue-adherent bacteria in CRC patients and relate these to the DNA hypermethylation of patient colon and
blood across different CMS subclasses, (2) determine how altered DNA methylation of tumor and blood relate
to mutation load and immune response, (3) distinguish pathogenic versus protective patterns of DNA methylation
in colon epithelial organoids, that result from exposure to P. micra, versus L. acidophilus."

ABSTRACT
The development of quantitative imaging (QI) methods for monitoring cancer therapy response has
been transformative for the development of novel cancer therapeutics. QI efforts have positioned imaging as
a key element in the design of clinical trials for cancer therapy response assessment. Hence, there is
increased interest by the academic and industry sectors to use web accessible research resources and
develop consensus approaches to validate QI methods for the next generation of clinical trials. This is
particularly relevant for assessment of cancer immunotherapy, since immunotherapy does not lead to a
decrease in tumor size, at least not in the immediate post-treatment phase. Therefore, we urgently need new
QI tools that can monitor tumor response to novel immunotherapies. The overall goal of our project is to
optimize and validate preclinical and clinical imaging techniques for in vivo quantification of tumor
associated macrophages (TAM) in osteosarcomas. Recent evidence has shown that the abundant TAM
response in the microenvironment of bone sarcomas can be employed to directly attack cancer cells.
Blockade of the cell surface molecule CD47 expressed on sarcoma cells resulted in activation of phagocytic
anti-cancer activity from TAM and efficiently eradicated tumor cells in mouse models of osteosarcoma. 26
Preclinical studies have been finalized and a multi-center phase I clinical trial is currently being planned, with
expected start date in 2021. To solve the unmet clinical need for a QI tool to monitor response to new TAM-
modulating therapies, our team developed a quantitative TAM imaging test, which relies on intravenous
injection of the iron supplement ferumoxytol. Ferumoxytol is composed of iron oxide nanoparticles, which are
phagocytosed by TAM and can be quantified with T2*-weighted MRI 45. Since ferumoxytol is FDA-approved
and can be used “off label” as a TAM biomarker, it is immediately clinically available. We showed that
ferumoxytol-MRI can detect TAM in osteosarcomas in mouse models 21 and patients 25. Through this
project, we will (a) optimize and validate pre-clinical quantitative imaging methods for TAM imaging in
an established mouse model of osteosarcoma, (b) implement the optimized methods in a co-clinical
trial in patients with osteosarcoma who are undergoing immunotherapy with CD47 mAb, and finally
(c) populate a web-accessible research resource with all the data, methods, and results collected
from the co-clinical investigations. Developing the proposed imaging test could represent a significant
breakthrough for clinicians as a new means for treatment stratification and new gold-standard imaging test for
predicting treatment response of novel immunotherapies. Our QI imaging test could be utilized to compare
the efficacy of different immune-modulating therapies in preclinical settings and translate the most primising
candidates to the clinic. Since the development of new therapeutic drugs is expensive and take years to
complete, the immediate value and heath care impact of our QI tool could be immense."

The goals of this application for a K24 midcareer investigator award in patient-oriented research (POR) are to
allow me to devote more time to augment capabilities in POR with a focus on non-infectious complications of
HIV, and provide mentorship to junior investigators. With an aging population of people with HIV (PWH), research
on prevention and management of non-infectious complications of HIV will continue to increase in importance. I
am an infectious diseases specialist trained in epidemiology whose research has primarily focused on elucidating
the impact of HIV and antiretroviral therapy (ART) on bone health. I have established multidisciplinary
collaborations over the last 15 years to evaluate the epidemiology of bone loss, osteoporosis and fractures in
PWH, determine the impact of perinatal HIV on bone acquisition and peak bone mass, and perform clinical trials
to mitigate bone loss with ART. I have also led translational studies using novel imaging and biomarkers to
investigate pathogenic mechanisms; however, these mechanisms are still not completely understood, largely
due to lack of tissue-based studies. Biospecimens from recently completed studies, including the comprehensive
first bone biopsy study of PWH before and after ART initiation and a study of women undergoing the menopausal
transition (RO1 AI095089) provide new opportunities for mechanistic insights. The Specific Aims of the Research
Plan are to: (1) investigate the pathophysiologic underpinnings of impaired bone formation associated with HIV
and ART through transcriptomic analysis of bone biopsies; (2) delineate the role of bone-derived hormones on
fat gain with ART initiation, (3) evaluate associations between DNA methylation signatures and osteoporosis in
women with HIV. Each Aim is designed specifically to augment the training of junior investigators. The K24
provides me opportunity for formal training in high dimensional data analyses and mentored experiential training
with the proposed epigenome analyses. A central component of my mentoring program is an individualized
approach to training, which includes a needs assessment of core research competencies and an ongoing
evaluation process. I will draw upon the superb resources and multidisciplinary expertise at Columbia University
and within HIV research networks that I have worked in throughout my career, especially the MACS/WIHS
Combined Cohort Study and the AIDS Clinical Trials Group. In addition, a Mentor Advisory Committee consisting
of experienced leaders in POR and education at Columbia University will guide me in building a structured and
sustainable mentoring program to develop the next generation POR investigators in HIV research."

A multi-investigator, multi-center plan is proposed to develop a gene-based retinal therapy for inherited
retinal maculopathies caused by mutations in the ABCA4 gene using a naturally-occurring canine model. A
subgroup of these patients with ABCA4 bi-allelic truncation mutations show a loss of central cones during
childhood that is followed by an “explosive” centrifugal progression of photoreceptor degeneration leading
also to peripheral visual malfunction. The proposal builds on success achieved during the current grant
period in moving AAV-based gene therapy for RPGR-XLRP to a human clinical trial, as well as developing
and validating in a canine model a novel gene therapy for another severe and early-onset ciliopathy, NPHP5-
LCA. Results in the dog have shown that the cone-rich central retina can be targeted and rescued even
when intervention occurs at late stages of cone disease, a finding that is highly relevant to this proposal. We
have recently identified a loss of function mutation in the canine ABCA4 gene that causes a retinal
phenotype with striking similarities with human ABCA4-CRD: early accumulation of lipofuscin in the cone-rich
central retina followed by pan-retinal degeneration later in life. We will capitalize on availability of this model
to improve our understanding of ABCA4 disease and develop a nanoparticle-mediated gene therapy that can
accommodate delivery of the large size of this gene. Our proposal is divided into four aims that will: 1-
establish the natural history of disease in the canine model; 2- optimize a lead nanoparticle construct that
can efficiently transduce cones, rods and RPE in rodents and dogs; 3- identify the optimal route of delivery,
dose, and lead vector to target the cone-rich canine central retina, in preparation for 4- proof of concept
studies in ABCA4-mutant dogs treated at early and later stages of cone disease/degeneration. While the test
system is the ABCA4-mutant dog model, the therapeutic questions that are addressed apply broadly to other
retinopathies caused by mutations in large size genes whose delivery may benefit from the development and
validation of this nanoparticle delivery platform. The research studies described in this proposal represent a
continuation of a longstanding collaboration between a group of vision scientists at the University of
Pennsylvania that already have brought retinal gene therapy to the clinic for RPE65-LCA, CNGB3-
achromatopsia , and RPGR-XLRP. This new program will greatly benefit from the joint expertise of a
consortium of investigators from three academic institutions (University of Pennsylvania, Johns Hopkins
University, and Columbia University) that will provide the necessary knowledge in ABCA4 biology,
nanoparticle-mediated DNA transfer, small and large animal models, and human ABCA4 disease, to address
the current unmet medical need for a treatment for this most common form of inherited retinal degeneration."

Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a leading cause of heart failure and the leading reason for heart
transplantation. Major gaps exist in our understanding of the pathophysiology of DCM and mutations in the
gene that encodes the nuclear envelope proteins lamin A and C (LMNA) are considered to be the most
common cause of DCM. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie “cardiolaminopathy” remain
elusive, and it is unknown why mutations in this ubiquitously expressed gene have such a disproportionate
effect on the heart. Using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSCs)-derived endothelial cells (iPSC-ECs), we
recently studied a family affected by DCM due to a frameshift variant in LMNA, which showed endothelial
dysfunction (Sayed et al. Science Translational Medicine, 2020). This EC dysfunction could be reversed by
upregulating Krüppel-like Factor 2 (KLF2) by treatment of iPSC-ECs with a subset of statins, including
lovastatin. Importantly, this improvement in EC dysfunction had a positive effect on co-cultured iPSC-
cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) from cardiolaminopathy patients, indicating an intricate crosstalk between the ECs
and CMs in LMNA cardiomyopathy.
 Despite impressive progress, little attention has been given to the potential importance of cell-to-cell
signaling between ECs and CMs, despite the fact that ECs serve a paracrine function to enhance signaling in
CMs, especially in context to pharmacological stimulation. This knowledge gap impedes our comprehensive
understanding of organ dysfunction at a multi-cellular level. The overarching goal of our proposal is to use a
multidisciplinary approach that integrates human iPSCs, bioengineering tools, genome editing, and NGS to
gain novel insights into the pathogenesis of DCM. Using human iPSCs, we propose to decipher the impaired
cross-talk between ECs and CMs in LMNA cardiomyopathy and elucidate the beneficial class effects of statins
in improving the EC-CM signaling as a key factor in regulating cardiac function. We will pursue three specific
aims. In Aim 1: we will establish an experimental platform to study the genotype-phenotype association of
LMNA mutations on ECs and CMs. For this, we will recapitulate the EC-CM crosstalk in LMNA iPSC-derived
cells with 3D engineered heart tissues (EHTs). In Aim 2: we will decipher the mechanism of EC-CM crosstalk
in LMNA iPSC-derived EHTs using single-cell approaches (scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq). In Aim 3: we will
validate the key regulatory players of EC-CM crosstalk in LMNA cardiomyopathy by using CRISPR technology
and zebrafish animal model. We have provided compelling preliminary data to support the soundness of
our hypothesis-driven research proposal, and we are well positioned to achieve the project goals
within five years. If successful, our studies will provide a new paradigm for understanding the
pathogenesis and treatment of familial DCM."
10894218,"Summary for the Regenerative Engineering Training Program
A major health challenge that our society faces is premature death and morbidity associated with the
shortage of healthy donor tissues or organs for transplantation and the limited regenerative capacity of
our body due to serious injury or disease. Research that entails the convergence of disparate disciplines
to create new frameworks, tools, and a new common language is positioned to better enable solutions
to complex problems such as the aforementioned one. Regenerative engineering is the convergence
of advanced materials science, stem cell and developmental biology, physical sciences, and
translational medicine to reconstruct or regenerate complex tissues and organs. The objective of this
training program is to offer the curriculum and environment needed to train the next generation of
convergence researchers that are versed in the development and use of regenerative engineering
solutions. Specifically, program graduates will have the capacity to develop scientific, technical, and
clinical knowledge and skills that will enable them to recognize and solve challenges associated with
the restoration of tissue and organ function. Core innovative elements of the program include: 1) clinical
immersion rotations to gain direct insight into organ failure and tissue reconstruction challenges that
afflict patients and physicians; 2) a 3-member mentorship team that includes 1 clinical, 1 life/physical
sciences, and 1 engineering faculty member; 3) internships at companies with product development
expertise involving regenerative engineering; and 4) experiential courses to learn essential
experimental techniques. The program, housed in the Center for Advanced Regenerative Engineering
at Northwestern University, will be a joint effort involving diverse faculty from the schools of engineering,
arts and sciences, and medicine. Northwestern University has a long history of transdisciplinary
collaborations and has the resources and pedagogical tools to establish a unique national program to
train new leaders. Trainees will be mentored by preceptors working in molecular and stem cell biology,
nanotechnology, additive manufacturing, regenerative engineering, molecular biophysics, biomaterials,
bioelectronics, surgery, and translational medicine. Examples of ongoing collaborations include
programs for the regeneration of bladder, bone, blood vessels, pancreas, liver, kidney, skin, muscle,
the immune system, and nerves. We propose to train 3 pre-doctoral trainees in year 1 and 6 trainees
for each of years 2-5. Trainees will be selected from applicants in the department of Biomedical
Engineering, including those from the medical scientist training program. We expect to produce the
next generation of regenerative engineering thought leaders that are competent in convergence
research aimed at tackling the aforementioned societal health challenges and improving patient
outcomes."

A protein traffic control system that regulates left-right patterning and heart development
Structural birth defects represent the leading cause of infant deaths. Congenital Heart Defects (CHDs) are the
most common structural birth defects, affecting ~40,000 babies each year. Amongst CHDs, a disproportionate
burden of mortality and morbidity is due to “severe” CHDs, defined as those that require surgery or a
procedure before the first year of life. The molecular mechanisms that drive severe CHDs are incompletely
understood, hampering preventative, diagnostic and therapeutic advances. Data from mouse studies and
human birth registries have revealed a striking association between severe CHDs and heterotaxy, defects in
left-right patterning of visceral organs. By integrating the expertise of three investigators in signal transduction,
mouse development, human genetics and CHDs, we have identified a novel cell-surface ubiquitination
pathway (the “MMM pathway”) that plays widespread roles in the patterning of tissues during development.
Disruption of this pathway leads to a characteristic syndrome of heterotaxy with severe CHDs in embryonic
mice, along with defects in other tissues such as the limb, skeleton and face. Three dimensional
reconstructions of the intracardiac anatomy of MMM mutant embryos reveal the presence of severe CHDs also
often seen in human patients, including double outlet right ventricle and transposition of the great arteries. The
MMM pathway is anchored at the cell surface by a receptor-like ubiquitin ligase complex composed of MEGF8,
a single-pass transmembrane protein, and MGRN1, a RING superfamily E3 ligase. This unique
membrane-tethered ubiquitination machine attenuates signaling through the iconic Hedgehog (Hh) pathway.
Mechanistically, the MMM components decrease the abundance of the Hh transducer Smoothened (SMO) by
direct ubiquitination, thereby reducing the sensitivity of target cells to Hh ligands. We propose to test the
hypothesis that the MMM pathway functions as a traffic control system for signaling receptors that regulate
left-right patterning and cardiac development. Our first aim is focused on understanding the biochemical
function and developmental roles of MOSMO, an uncharacterized tetraspan membrane protein that we
identified as a third component of the MMM pathway. In the second aim, we test whether the heterotaxy and
CHDs seen in MMM mutant embryos are caused by elevated Hh signaling strength at critical periods in
development and also search for other signaling receptors regulated by the MMM pathway. Finally, we
leverage our comprehensive biochemical and developmental assays for MMM proteins to test the functionality
of rare coding variants in MMM genes seen in human patients with severe CHDs. Successful completion of this
project will uncover trafficking and signaling mechanisms that underlie the long-observed link between left-right
patterning and heart development and consequently advance our understanding of the molecular
pathophysiology of severe CHDs."

AHRQ previously funded the development of Elder Tree (ET), a laptop-based eHealth system shown in a
randomized trial to improve quality of life and health factors among older adults with multiple chronic conditions
(MCCs) such as diabetes and hypertension. MCCs are pervasive and costly among older adults, reducing
quality of life and accounting for 90% of Medicare spending. Self-management can help patients control their
conditions, but these skills are rarely taught in primary care. ET provides tools and support for such self-
management and addresses the frustration, discouragement, and loneliness shared by all patients with MCCs,
regardless of specific disease. Despite positive results, though, many study participants did not use ET
extensively, a problem for all health apps. In a separate survey, we learned that more than 60% of non-users
abandoned ET because the computer was too hard to use. Voice-controlled ""smart"" technology may solve this
problem. Smart speakers, used by speaking and listening rather than typing and reading, avoid barriers to use
such as poor vision, tremors, and interface complexity; they have been adopted at a rate faster than the
Internet or TV, especially among older adults. Smart displays enhance the system with a visual element,
helping users remember content and creating access to media meant to be viewed.
This application proposes to test the ability of voice-activated technology to expand the implementation and
sustain the use of a proven electronic health system. Specifically, we propose to test whether older adults with
MCCs will use and benefit more from ET delivered by a smart system (speaker plus display), due to ease of
use, than from a laptop version of ET. The proposal has 2 aims: 1) develop the smart system platform (ET-SS)
and 2) test it against laptop ET (ET-LT) in a 2-arm RCT. The trial will randomize 220 patients age 65+ with 4 or
more chronic conditions to receive for 8 months either ET-LT or ET-SS. We hypothesize that:
 · patients with ET-SS (vs. ET-LT) will have greater ET use and better quality of life in month 8.
 · these clinical outcomes will improve: a) 30-day hospital readmissions), b) medication adherence, and c)
 composite score of HbA1c, mg/dL, mmHg, FEV-1, BMI, PHQ-8, FAS-GFR, and Brief Pain Inventory.
 · the amount of ET use at 4 months will mediate the effects of ET at 8 months (i.e. greater use at 4
 months=greater effects at 8 months), and negative affect and Self-Determination Theory constructs of
 competence, social relatedness, and intrinsic motivation will mediate the effects of ET use.
 · ET-SS will have better outcomes for women and for patients with 6+ (vs. 4-5) chronic conditions.
We, the investigators who developed ET, have conducted numerous RCTs of eHealth systems and published
extensively. To our knowledge, this will be the first large RCT of a smart system as a platform to implement
and disseminate a health intervention. The result could make ET more accessible and effective for older
patients, improve their quality of life, and point the way to more impactful delivery of future eHealth innovations."

Ocular surface (OcS) exposure to the chemical warfare vesicant sulfur mustard (SM), or its analogue nitrogen
mustard (NM), causes immediate tissue damage and long-term pathology. Current medical countermeasures
(MCMs) frequently result in incomplete or transient efficacy. Excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen
species (ROS) induces oxidative stress (OXS), which plays prominently in OcS epithelial damage from a
variety of causes, including exposure to SM and analogues. ROS are produced by mitochondria. It is known
that mitochondria are damaged by exposure to SM analogues, but mechanisms leading to OXS are under-
explored. Recently, the project team made the unexpected discovery that dynasore and dyngo-4a, small
molecules that target dynamin family proteins involved in mitochondrial homeostasis, are remarkably protective
against OXS due to hydrogen peroxide (HP) exposure in an OcS epithelial cell culture model. In a follow-up
study, they identified a novel pathway whereby dynasore protects by inhibiting Ca2+ influx, shifting activity of
the unfolded protein response (UPR) towards homeostasis and inhibiting mitochondrial transition pore (mPTP)
opening. In Preliminary Data presented herein, they now show that NM exposure also induces the UPR in the
cell culture model, but dynasore is not protective. Interestingly, another small molecule inhibitor of dynamins is
protective: mdivi-1. Signficantly, mdivi-1 did not shift the UPR towards homeostasis in NM-exposed cells and
did not protect against HP exposure. These results indicate that mechanisms leading to OXS after exposure to
HP or NM must be different, and that elucidating the mechanism of mDivi-1 counteraction may provide
important insight into how NM damages cells. Mdivi-1 has been widely considered to be a specific inhibitor of
the mitochondrial-localized dynamin DRP1. However, it was recently reported that mdivi-1 also directly targets
mitochondrial energetics. The objective of this project is to investigate mitochondrial mechanisms in
OcS exposure to NM, the relationship to HP exposure, and mechanisms of OcS protection by mdivi-1.
The team will employ a well-established human corneal epithelial cell culture model. To ensure scientific rigor,
primary human corneal epithelial cells will be used to validate key results in vitro, and a mouse model will
provide in vivo validation. To add an innovative dimension, live cell evaluative methods and discovery
techniques will be applied, including Ca2+ imaging, mitochondrial imaging, cell-based reporter constructs,
transgenic reporter mice, RNA-seq and single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq). Results of the planned study will
provide new knowledge about how NM exposure leads to OXS. Mdivi-1 has the unusual capacity to attenuate
pathological ROS production while having limited impact on ROS in healthy cells, making it uniquely attractive
as a potential MCM."

 Over the last decade, there has been a dramatic increase in deaths resulting from drug overdoses.
Pharmacological interventions have proven to be transformative and life-saving in substance use disorders,
particularly in opioid addictions and overdoses. Today, there is an increasing interest in having an
armamentarium at clinician's disposal to address substance use disorders. There are three therapeutic classes
of drugs that are highly sought: alternatives, attenuators, and antidotes. Having alternative therapeutic
avenues for pain management other than opioids could help lower new addiction cases. For alternatives, we
look to anesthetics that maintain analgesic effects at sub-anesthetic concentrations. For attenuators, we seek
behavior-modifying drugs like ketamine and dizocilpine that have demonstrated reduced self-administration of
drugs of abuse like cocaine, alcohol, methamphetamine, morphine, and nicotine in animal models. As a final
line of defense, we endeavor to discover new drug overdose antidotes that reverse the toxicity of abused
drugs. The discovery of novel chemical matter in these therapeutic classes could lead towards the
development of new pharmacotherapies for treating addictions, but pharmacological modification of addictive
behaviors in mammalian models is costly and challenging to evaluate.
 The objective of this proposal is to accelerate the discovery and characterization of novel small
molecules affecting behavior using high-throughput screening of compounds in live animals guided by
behavioral profiling as opposed to biochemical or cell-based assays. Our work exploits an automated
technological platform in which the behaviors of hundreds of larval zebrafish under the influence of neuroactive
compounds can be assessed and compared simultaneously. It enables the high-throughput screening of
thousands of compounds for those that phenocopy neuroactive drugs of interest. The central premise of our
approach is that pharmacological modulation by these therapeutic classes, their unique behavioral changes in
larval zebrafish, and the identification of new related pharmacology are inter-connected. Accordingly, we
predict that molecules that phenocopy anesthetics, ketamine, or the PQs ability to reverse benzodiazepine
sedation will be new chemical matter for alternatives, attenuators, and antidotes of abused drugs. From this
perspective, we can use the high-throughput behavioral assays in larval zebrafish as a primary screen of a
structurally diverse set of >100,000 compounds. Importantly, from initial pilot screens we already have new
chemical matter of all these classes in hand. We will perform mechanistic studies using state-of-the-art imaging
of the zebrafish central nervous system to help further characterize new pharmacology. An essential part of the
work is the translation of newly discovered neuroactives into rodent models of pain and substance use
disorders."
10792959,"Bradykinin (BK) B1 receptor (BKB1R) activity is involved in a wide range of pathological conditions including
edema, inflammation, asthma, chronic pain, vasculopathy, neuropathy, obesity, diabetic retinopathy and cancer.
Antagonists of these receptors would be expected to be of great therapeutic utility, however, although several
BKB1R antagonists have entered clinical trials, none have emerged successfully from Phase II. BKB1Rs are
generally not expressed in most tissues unless exposed to inflammatory mediators and when expressed, have
a high level of constitutive (agonist-independent) receptor activity. Although the reasons for the failure of BKB1R
antagonists in clinical trials have not been reported, it is likely that the high level of constitutive activity of the
BKB1R, which is not reduced by standard antagonists, is responsible for efficacy failures. Reduction of
constitutive receptor activity requires an orthosteric ligand with inverse agonist activity or a negative allosteric
regulator. Unfortunately, the only known orthosteric inverse agonists for the BKB1R are very weak and there are
no allosteric regulators that reduce constitutive activity. The premise underlying this project is that reduction of
constitutive BKB1R activity is an important component of a therapeutically effective antagonist. The goal of this
project is to identify novel compounds that reduce BKB1R function by both antagonizing the
endogenous agonist (des-Arg10-kallidin) and reducing constitutive BKB1R activity. This effect can be
obtained with an orthosteric inverse agonist or a negative allosteric modulator (NAM). In Aim 1a, we propose to
screen a library of ~170,000 small molecules to identify compounds that reduce agonist-activated and
constitutive activity of the human BKB1Rs expressed in HEK cells. In Aim 1b, we will screen hits from Aim
1a to eliminate compounds that have non-specific effects or that alter BKB2R activity. In Aim 1c, compounds
from Aim 1b will be rigorously tested pharmacologically (e.g. Schild analysis experiments) to identify allosteric
versus orthosteric mechanisms of action. As NAMs have several advantages over orthosteric ligands, including
specificity, safety and the ability to fine-tune receptor function along with reducing constitutive receptor activity,
we will prioritize NAMs over orthosteric inverse agonists. Finally, in Aim 1d we will confirm that the BKB1 NAMs
and inverse agonists function as expected when BKB1Rs are naturally expressed using human lung
microvascular endothelial cells. This work will provide the preliminary data and candidate molecules needed to
move forward to IND-enabling studies. Although this project is high risk, the identification of first-in-class
negative allosteric regulators that reduce constitutive activity of human BKB1Rs is highly desirable."

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neuromuscular disease characterized by motor neuron death and severe
muscle wasting; failure of the respiratory muscle is a common cause of mortality in ALS patients. While ALS is
generally considered as a “dying-forward” process of motor neurons, studies from us and other research groups
support that muscle appears to be a primary target of ALS, in addition to being a victim of axonal withdrawal.
This project builds on the scientific premise that ALS is a disease of systemic oxidative stress that impacts the
cellular processof muscle membrane repair and quality control, and consequently integrity of the neuromuscular
junction (NMJ) that provides the structural and functional framework for bidirectional crosstalk between motor
neuron and muscle fibers. We discovered that the ALS mouse (SOD1G93A) diaphragm muscle displays increased
membrane damage that occurs prior to the onset of ALS symptoms. We identified localized membrane repair
defects near the NMJ of ALS muscle, where segmented mitochondria dysfunction precedes the onset of ALS
disease. At the molecular level, we provide evidence that mitochondria-oxidative stress can affect the elemental
process of cell membrane repair that is governed by MG53, a member of the tripartite family protein that serves
essential roles in nucleating the assembly of repair patches at membrane injury sites. We also found that
compromised muscle repair and MG53 aggregation is a common pathology in human ALS. The recombinant
human MG53 (rhMG53) protein, when administered systemically, facilitated the repair of sarcolemma injury and
reduced oxidative stress, consequently improving NMJ innervation and prolonging the lifespan of the ALS mice.
In addition to facilitating membrane repair, MG53 also participates in autophagy signaling via its intrinsic E3-
ligase activity to contribute to cellular quality control, which could feedback to preserve membrane integrity under
stress condition. These findings support the multifaceted role of MG53 in alleviating neuromuscular function
decline in ALS. The long-term goals of our team-based research are to understand (1) how muscle mitochondrial

Light responses are initiated in rod and cone photoreceptors, processed by retinal interneurons, and synaptically
transmitted to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), which send information, in the form of spike trains, to the brain. In
degenerative retinal disorders, including Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) and Retinitis Pigmentosa
(RP), the photoreceptors gradually die off, depriving downstream neurons of light-sensitive input. However,
recent evidence suggests that losing photoreceptors is only part of the problem in these disorders. Downstream
retinal neurons become hyperactive, with retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) firing spontaneously in darkness at up to
10 times faster than in healthy retina, corrupting the proper encoding of visual information. We recently reported
that retinoic acid (RA), a small molecule that activates gene transcription, is the signal that triggers RGC
hyperactivity. Blocking the receptor for RA in vivo can reverse hyperactivity, unmasking light responses that
would otherwise be obscured by spontaneous RGC firing. Blocking RA receptors in the retina also augments
the contrast-sensitivity of learned visual behaviors in a mouse model of RP. Our goal in this project is to assess
whether drugs or gene therapies that inhibit RA signaling can improve vision in mouse models of RP, with the
hope of extending useful vision for years in humans with degenerative retinal disorders. First, we will ask whether
inhibiting RA signaling not only improves light-sensitivity, but actually improves conscious visual function in
vision-impaired mice, assessed with behavioral tests of contrast sensitivity and spatial frequency threshold. We
will determine how when during the degeneration process RA inhibitors are most effective, revealing the optimal
time for beginning treatment. Second, we will investigate retinal neurons that lie upstream of RGCs, namely
bipolar cells and amacrine cells. We will ask whether pathophysiological changes in these presynaptic neurons
are also induced by elevated RA signaling and whether inhibiting RAR can reverse these changes, providing
critical information for effective cellular targeting of gene therapy. Third, we will test whether vision can be
improved by inhibiting the enzyme that synthesizes RA, with a re-purposed drug that is already FDA-approved
for other indications, paving the way for human clinical studies. Taken together, this project will establish the
proof-of-principle behind a new treatment paradigm for augmenting vision in retinal degenerative disorders."

The prevention of adolescent mental health disorders is an underused but scientifically justified approach to
improving the public’s mental health. Youth with mental health disorders before the age of 18 have poorer
outcomes in education, social, employment, and health compared with youth without mental health or
substance use disorders. Hispanic youth report higher rates of depressive and anxiety symptoms, drug use,
suicide ideation and attempts, compared to their non-Hispanic White peers. Interventions designed to interrupt
the sequelae of mental health disorders and other poor outcomes are imperative for maximizing health among
Hispanic youth. Familias Unidas, which was highlighted in the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering,
and Medicine prevention report, has been found to be efficacious and effective in the reduction and/or
prevention of adolescent health problems. Familas Unidas has had crossover effects on internalizing
symptoms for youth who report low family communication, the intervention’s primary mediational pathway. It
has also reduced suicide ideation rates for youth reporting this same mediational pathway of poor family
communication. The online adaptation of Familias Unidas, eHealth Familias Unidas, has also been found to
reduce adolescent health problems. However, to date, evidence-based preventive interventions such as
Familias Unidas and eHealth Familias Unidas have largely been tested in schools and delivered mostly by
research staff. Evaluating these interventions in real world studies of primary care and understanding the
implementation processes that facilitate or impede the integration of interventions in systems is key to
improving mental health and reducing disparities in the U.S. The goal of the proposed application is to evaluate
in an effectiveness-implementation type I hybrid trial, an enhanced version of eHealth Familias Unidas for
reducing depressive and anxious symptoms as well as suicide behavior in Hispanic youth. Using a randomized
rollout design of 18 clinics, the study’s aims are: AIM 1: Evaluate the effectiveness of eHealth Familias Unidas
for Mental Health in preventing/reducing depressive, anxiety symptoms, suicide ideation and behavior, and
drug misuse among those screened as having poor family communication or elevated levels of depressive or
anxiety symptoms, or a history of suicide behavior (ideation or attempts); AIM 2: Determine whether
intervention effects are partially mediated by family communication and externalizing behaviors, including drug
misuse, and moderated by parental depression; and Exploratory AIM 3: Intervention impact on mental health
and drug misuse as well as sustainment will vary by quality of implementation at the levels of clinic and
clinician. Participants will be assed at baseline, 3, 6, and 18-months post baseline."

 The proposed Plan to Enhance Diversity (PED) at the University of Kentucky (UK) Markey Cancer Center
(MCC) under the leadership of Dr. Lovoria Williams (CP) applies an equity lens to MCC’s comprehensive
mission to reduce the cancer burden with a focus on Kentucky and its most vulnerable populations through
research, prevention, treatment, education and community engagement. As the MCC inaugural Associate
Director (AD) for Equity, Diversity and Inclusion, Dr. Williams (CP) has a prominent role with direct reporting to
MCC Director Dr. B. Mark Evers (TO) as part of MCC’s priority on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) within a
highly collaborative senior leadership team. DEI efforts are fully integrated into MCC’s FY24-28 Strategic Plan,
with a dedicated pillar of activity. PED is supported by DEI Coordinator Ms. Tianna Acree and operates
collaboratively with Cancer Research Training and Education Coordination (CRTEC) and MCC Administration.
PED builds on early DEI successes that established a DEI Committee, leveraged campus-wide trainee and
faculty career-enhancing programs (such as NIH-funded T32s), and applied a highly successful model of rural-
focused cancer research education to the development of new dynamic DEI-focused pathway programs led by
CRTEC. Moreover, MCC’s Leadership and members are participating in training in foundational DEI and health
equity education that will prepare them to cultivate diverse, inclusive environments. The overall objectives of
PED are to integrate DEI throughout the fabric of the MCC and to promote a climate that advances inclusive
excellence in cancer research, education and community outreach. Three Specific Aims of the proposed PED
are to: 1) Enhance participation of underrepresented minority (URM) and women trainees, staff and faculty in
the cancer center. To achieve this Aim, we plan on developing equitable processes to bolster, implement and
sustain efforts to recruit, retain and develop diverse talent; 2) Accelerate the career and leadership
development of women and URM early career faculty. This Aim will be accomplished by leveraging internal
and national research and leadership development programs to support career and research agendas,
increasing engagement in MCC decision-making processes and developing a new leadership academy; 3)
Establish a sustainable infrastructure to advance DEI throughout the MCC and criteria for monitoring progress
toward achievement of diversity goals. This Aim will be achieved by maintaining the MCC DEI Committee,
coalescing DEI resources, providing DEI training and developing appropriate methods and timepoints to
evaluate fidelity to the methods proposed under each Specific Aim and track DEI progress. Baseline
demographic data of MCC members, trainees and staff will allow the examination of data gaps. With continued
CCSG support, MCC will build on early successes and MCC’s strong infrastructure and will leverage
institutional commitment to advance workforce diversity of trainees, research staff, faculty and leaders
reflective of the statewide Kentucky catchment area and eventually the nation."

 Markey Cancer Center’s (MCC) Cancer Prevention and Control (CP) Research Program fosters high-
impact, population-based and community-engaged research with the overarching goal of reducing cancer
disparities in Kentucky. CP research spans the population science translation pipeline from advancing
understanding of risk factors and intervention targets, to developing and testing new interventions, to studying
the process of dissemination and implementation of evidence-based interventions into practice. Impactful
scientific contributions include genetic associations of human papillomavirus and patient survival in
oropharyngeal cancer, timely regulatory and policy research on novel smokeless tobacco products, trials of
innovative interventions to reduce carcinogenic environmental exposures, trials of interventions to promote
quality of life outcomes among rural cancer survivors, and community implementation trials to prevent hepatitis
C transmission and implement cancer prevention and screening guidelines in communities throughout
Kentucky and Appalachia. CP impact also extends to public health policy within Kentucky and nationally, and
in advancing standards of care related to tobacco cessation and lung cancer screening. The CP Program
combines these strengths to address three Aims: Advance the understanding of risk factors and intervention
targets for cancer prevention and control (Aim 1); Develop and test the efficacy of interventions across the
cancer control continuum (Aim 2); Study the dissemination and implementation of evidence-based
interventions (Aim 3). The CP Program has been transformed by substantial strategic investments that have
led to new leadership and by the infusion of multiple recruitments that have expanded the breadth and depth of
program research, combined with the continued success of long-standing program members. The program’s
peer-reviewed funding has increased by 50%, and NCI funding has grown dramatically by 567% to now
comprise 33% of peer-reviewed funding, compared to 7% in 2017. The maturation of the program is evident in
a 24% increase in clinical trial accrual and by the awarding of NCI P01 and UH3 multi-investigator, inter-
institutional grants and the only NCI T32 focused on rural cancer disparities. CP investigators are highly
engaged with and responsive to the needs of MCC’s catchment area residents and are engaged in inter-
programmatic research that addresses MCC’s catchment research priorities, in collaboration with Community
Outreach and Engagement. Thus, the CP Program is integral to achieving the overall MCC mission to reduce
the cancer burden with a focus on Kentucky and its most vulnerable populations through research, prevention,
treatment, education and community engagement."
10888336,"Genetic regulators of vascular smooth muscle thermogenic differentiation (M. Lynes, Project Lead)
Obesity and metabolic syndrome are major public health burdens and occur when fat mass increases, leading
to dysfunction in adipose tissue. Obesity is negatively associated with the presence of thermogenic brown
adipose tissue (BAT), which can be detected in humans and mice exposed to cold temperatures. The major
cell type in adipose tissue is the adipocyte, and in addition to white adipocytes, cells that express Uncoupling
protein 1 (Ucp1) are termed brown, beige, or recruitable thermogenic adipocytes. Adipocytes can arise from
two distinct lineages; the canonical lineage derived from mesenchymal preadipocytes that express platelet
derived growth factor receptor alpha (Pdgfra), or a newly identified vascular smooth muscle (VSM) lineage that
are recruited by cold challenge and are characterized by the expression of Transient receptor potential cation
channel subfamily V member 1 (Trpv1). Importantly, cells from the Trpv1+ VSM lineage can express more
UCP1 than other adipocytes, supporting the premise that they are a distinct cell type. We propose the novel
hypothesis that Trpv1+ VSM derived adipocytes are a unique type of fat cell that can regulate whole body
metabolism. To test this hypothesis, we aim to: 1) inhibit adipogenesis of Trpv1+ VSM derived adipocytes and
determine the impact on systemic metabolism; and 2) utilize the unique proteomic signature Trpv1+ VSM
derived adipocytes to identify functional networks for further study. We will utilize a Trpv1 lineage tracing
mouse model to track the contribution of Trpv1+ VSM cells to thermogenic adipocytes. In the first aim, we will
block Ppara signaling using CRISPR-mediated gene editing specifically in Trpv1+ cells and quantify the
frequency of adipocytes from the Trpv1+ VSM lineage as well as the effect on glucose and triglyceride
metabolism. In the second aim, we will take an unbiased approach to identify the proteome of adipocytes from
the Trpv1+ lineage and compare it to cells from the canonical Pdgfra lineage of adipocytes. Proteins that are
identified can then be edited using our Trpv1 lineage tracing model to determine their impact on adipogenesis
and systemic metabolism. This project will be strongly supported by the COBRE Physiology Core (for cellular
bioenergetics), the Histopathology and Microscopy Core (for tissue processing, staining, analysis, and confocal
microscopy), and the Proteomics and Lipidomics Core (lipid and protein profiling). This innovative project is led
by a new junior investigator, Dr. Matthew Lynes, who will be supported by outstanding expert mentors in the
fields of adipose tissue development (Patrick Seale PhD), thermogenic fat (Shingo Kajimura PhD) and mouse
genetics (Joseph Nadeau PhD). Determining the role of Trpv1+ VSM derived adipocytes in systemic
metabolism as well as their unique protein signature could provide new targets and strategies to treat obesity
and metabolic syndrome."
10919790,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Adoptive cell transfer in the form of chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CART) therapy has revolutionized the
treatment of hematologic malignancies and is slowly making inroads into solid tumors. Challenges to the efficacy
and safety of CARTs in prostate cancer include antigen heterogeneity, an immunologically “cold” tumor
microenvironment, poor persistence, and exhaustion. We have developed a novel CART therapy targeting six
transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate 1 (STEAP1) which we found to be expressed more broadly
than prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) in over 87% of lethal metastatic prostate cancers. In preclinical
human-in-mouse and mouse-in-mouse studies, STEAP1 CART demonstrated 1) specificity and antitumor
activity in multiple prostate cancer models with varying levels of STEAP1 antigen density and 2) preliminary
evidence of safety. The STEAP1 CART program has been accepted into the NCI Experimental Therapeutics
(NExT) Program to support clinical translation to a first-in-human study in men with metastatic castration-
resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Furthermore, androgens are well known to be immunosuppressive, yet
CART therapy is used without consideration of local androgen concentrations or the sex of the patient. We
present evidence that targeting the androgen receptor is necessary for effective T cell-specific immunotherapy
and enhances the function of adoptive cell therapy products. In addition, we demonstrate that androgen receptor
signaling inhibitors (ARSI) improve antigen presentation and promote T cell function within the prostate tumor
microenvironment. Together, our observations suggest that combining CART therapy with ARSI could improve
therapeutic outcomes in advanced prostate cancer patients. To the best of our knowledge this is the first
combination of preclinical studies and a CART clinical trial to target STEAP1 in advanced prostate cancer
patients.
The goal of this proposal is to understand if we can improve CART function by perturbing androgen receptor
signaling with an ARSI. We hypothesize that we can improve STEAP1 CART cell persistence and function
by combining it with ARSI treatment. We will test this hypothesis in the following Aims: 1) Evaluate the effect
of AR modulation on STEAP1 CART phenotype and function; 2) Investigate whether inflammation and ARSI
impacts safety and toxicity of STEAP1 CART therapy; and 3) Conduct a phase I clinical trial to assess the
feasibility, safety, and efficacy of STEAP1 CART therapy alone and in combination with enzalutamide in men
with STEAP1+ mCRPC.
These studies provide the preclinical framework for understanding how ARSI and/or AR deletion impacts the
function of a novel prostate CART product. Importantly, these studies will provide critical insight into the safety
and toxicity of STEAP1 CART therapy alone or with ARSI and reveal potential therapeutic toxicity."

Virus-based technology has emerged as a powerful tool in neuroscience and vision research,
enabling optogenetic and chemogenetic manipulation of brain activity, circuit tracing, and gain- and
loss-of-function genetic modifications in the retina and brain. Electrophysiology- and imaging-focused
laboratories, however, often lack the expertise and resources needed to effectively employ these
molecular biology approaches, and standardized methods can enhance the productivity of even
experienced molecular neuroscience groups. The Viral Module was created to fill this need by
generating, maintaining, and designing high-quality viruses for vision applications. Led by Dr. Zhigang
He, and a staff of experienced molecular biologists, the Viral module will serve as a repository for the
proper storage, maintenance, handling, and distribution of pre-made viral vectors and also assist in
the design, optimization, and generation of custom viral constructs. Despite its recent addition to the
Vision Core, the Viral Module has already been utilized by a significant number of investigators
working in both rodents and primates and constitutes an essential resource for the wider Harvard
vision research community."
10919795,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Prostate cancer (PC) is notable for the expression and activity of a unique therapeutic target – the androgen
receptor (AR). PC growth and survival is driven by AR, a nuclear transcription factor activated by androgens
such as testosterone (T) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). AR activity can be suppressed through ligand
reduction in the form of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). While ADT is initially effective in treating
metastatic PC, disease progression, termed metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC),
inevitably occurs after several years. Additionally, long-term ADT is associated with significant mental and
physical quality of life complications. Consequently, there has been a longstanding interest in the development
of therapeutic modalities that can further exploit AR signaling to enhance treatment responses and also
improve quality of life. In this proposal, our objective is to integrate and leverage two key aspects of PC
biology: AR activity and DNA damage/repair. Integrating AR signaling and HDR has important treatment
ramifications as a substantial body of preclinical and clinical work indicates that HDR deficiency (HDR-D) result
in vulnerabilities to at least two drug classes: platinum (PLAT) chemotherapy and PARP inhibitors (PARPi) as
well as radiation therapy.
We propose three Specific Aims:
Specific Aim 1. Conduct a Phase 2 clinical trial genotoxic therapeutics and supraphysiological androgen (SPA)
in patients with mCRPC to determine response rates, identify resistance mechanisms, and establish
biomarkers that associate with clinical responses.
Specific Aim 2. Identify the mechanism(s) by which therapeutics overdriving AR activity induce DNA damage,
regulate DNA repair processes, and enhance genotoxic chemotherapy.
Specific Aim 3. Identify therapeutic drug combinations and dosing/administration strategies that optimize the
therapeutic window resulting from AR expression and activity in mCRPC.
The research plan is structured to drive bidirectional assessments of clinically-relevant mechanisms involving
AR signaling and DNA repair in the context of treating advanced prostate cancer."
10892223,"Project Summary
 Biological differences between cells in healthy and diseased states are molecularly encoded in part
by coordinated differences in gene expression. Gene expression differences between healthy and disease
cell states may manifest as altered expression magnitudes of important regulatory factors, as well as
aberrant alternative splicing of genes to produce protein isoforms with divergent functions. Likewise, the
spatial localization of mRNAs within cells play important regulatory roles in modulating local protein
translation that may be disrupted in disease. And finally, cells exist within diverse microenvironments
where they signal and interact with different cells to maintain homeostasis within tissues. Quantitatively
evaluating these different aspects of transcriptional heterogeneity between cells in healthy and diseased
states is paramount to our understanding of disease etiology and the mechanisms for disease pathogenesis.
 Recent advancements in next-generation sequencing and imaging technologies are enabling
investigators to quantitatively measure gene expression in individual cells at transcriptome-scale across
different biological and disease settings in a high-throughput manner. As such, the ability to perform
computational analysis is becoming increasingly paramount in order to extract biological insights from such
data. My research program develops statistical approaches and computational tools to identify and
characterize these aspects of transcriptional and spatial heterogeneity and quantitatively evaluate the
functional consequences of this variation.
 Here, we will focus on developing computational tools to delineate 1) transcriptional heterogeneity
across populations of cells, 2) subcellular spatial transcriptional heterogeneity within cells, and 3) spatial-
contextual heterogeneity among cells in tissues. Specifically, I will build on my previous experience
developing statistical approaches for unified clustering analysis in order to identify the appropriate normal
cells for comparison with cells from transcriptionally heterogeneous diseased states. I will further build on
my previous experience detecting alternative splicing to characterize aberrant alternative splicing within
individual cells and assess how such alternative splicing may impact cellular function through subcellular
localization. I will further assess how mRNA localization patterns may change through dynamic processes
such as the cell-cycle and neuroglia maturation within tissues to impact cell-fate. Finally, I will assess how
the spatial-contextual organization of cells within tissues may impact cell-cell communication networks.
Although we focus on establishing proof of concept in model systems, pursuit of these research goals will
result in the development of new computational methods available as open-source software that can be
tailored and applied to address fundamental biological questions in a variety of disease settings."

A growing number of COVID-19 transmission models have been developed to help forecast the on-going epi-
demic and compare outcomes of different non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) in terms of cases, deaths,
and medical supply needs. Most of these models do not include adaptive behavioral effects describing how risk
perceptions and fatigue inﬂuence engagement with social distancing and transmission reduction. Decisions on
mask-wearing, levels of social contact, and vaccination will deﬁne whether the epidemic is controlled or enters
annual circulation. We propose the development of population-based (PBM) and agent-based (ABM) transmis-
sion models to study the interplay between individual behavior and transmission dynamics, while considering the
many uncertainties which still surround the virus, such as seasonal effects and the loss of immunity. Addition-
ally, our models will be used to study how COVID-19 and seasonal inﬂuenza and respective behaviors interact,
exacerbate outcomes, and potentially overwhelm the health care system. These models will build upon our prior
research. Since Fall 2016 we have conducted regular longitudinal surveys investigating attitudes towards, risk
perceptions of, and propensity to vaccinate for seasonal inﬂuenza. The ABM models constructed from these data
account for adaption and memory of past experiences, peer effects, and population heterogeneity. Using machine
learning methods, we have augmented a synthetic network representative of a small US city with this behavioral
data. We have continued to conduct modiﬁed versions of these surveys to track how these beliefs translate to
COVID-19. In parallel, we have developed a compartmental population-based model of COVID-19, which models
transmission and the effects of NPI intensity and timing on both health and economic outcomes. We propose to
extend our current compartmental PBM and build a new individual-level ABM, informed by longitudinal surveys.
We will conduct a four-year longitudinal panel survey to construct an empirical behavioral model for decisions
to socially distance, engage in transmission reduction measures (such as mask-wearing), and vaccinate. This
information will be combined with our existing synthetic network data-set to enable us to build an individual level
ABM of the spread of COVID-19 in a representative US city, integrated with our inﬂuenza ABM. This model will
capture both how individual behaviors impact macro-level disease transmission and how inﬂuenza and COVID-19
could interact. Insights and data from our individual-level model will be used to inform and parameterize adaptive
behavior within our compartment-level model, allowing for policy comparisons across a range of US states. In
addition, we will consider which policies are robust to key behavioral and technological uncertainties, such as the
extent of behavior change in response to perceived risk and the timing and effectiveness of vaccines. Finally,
we will develop web-based interactive tools that allow for the exploration and comparison of different policies in a
variety of potential futures."

Ischemic heart disease is the most common cause of death in the western world, largely due to myocardial
infarction (MI), the irreversible damage of myocardial tissue induced by the blockage in coronary
arteries. After MI, formation of new blood vessels, i.e., neovascularization, is crucial for ischemic tissue
reperfusion and repair. However, the newly formed vasculatures in infarcted tissue are characterized by
functional and structural abnormalities, which compromise vessel delivery function and cardiac repair after
MI. Likewise, aberrant non-productive neovascularization represents a promising therapeutic target for MI
treatment. Here, by utilizing endothelial lineage tracing and single-cell RNAseq technology, our preliminary
studies with a murine MI model reveal robust endothelial cell (EC) plasticity mediated through endothelial
mesenchymal transformation (Endo-MT, i.e., partial endothelial mesenchymal transition) during cardiac
repair after MI. We show that ECs acquire mesenchymal phenotypes including high proliferation and motility
after MI, leading to vascular abnormalities and non-productive neovascularization. We identify a PDGF/NF-
kB/HIF-1a/Snail-mediated axis that controls Endo-MT. Notably, EC-specific deletion of PDGF receptor-b
promotes post-MI tissue repair and cardiac function recovery in mice. Finally, pharmacological inhibition of
PDGF improves cardiac function recovery after MI. In addition, Snail is expressed in human MI-associated
ECs. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that endothelial plasticity drives non-productive
neovascularization and impedes cardiac repair after MI. To test this hypothesis, we will pursue the
following aims: 1) To define the molecular mechanisms for endothelial plasticity after MI; 2) To determine
the in vivo role of endothelial plasticity for aberrant neovascularization and cardiac repair after MI; and 3) To
test experiment therapy that targets PDGFR-mediated endothelial plasticity for MI treatment. Thus, targeting
EC plasticity may offer a promising therapeutic opportunity to recondition vascular microenvironment and
improve cardiac repair and function recovery after MI. Successful completion of this project will provide new
insights into the mechanism for aberrant neovascularization and may lead to development of new
therapeutic revenue for treating ischemic heart disease."

Chronic musculoskeletal (MSK) pain affects the lives of over a quarter of youth, with societal costs exceeding
$19.5 billion dollars in the U.S. each year. The impact of chronic MSK pain in adolescence is felt into adulthood
and is a documented risk for opioid misuse. There are a number of efficacious behavioral interventions for
adolescents with chronic pain, but many access-to-care barriers exist, highlighting the critical need to develop
digitally delivered behavioral interventions to drastically increase reach. Graded exposure is a theory-
driven, individually-tailored intervention for individuals with chronic pain targeting pain-related impairment by
exposing patients to previously feared and avoided activities. This project seeks to develop and evaluate the
feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of a digital exposure treatment (iGET Living) for adolescents with chronic
musculoskeletal (MSK) pain and their parents, utilizing a sequential replicated and randomized single-case
experimental design (SCED) and incorporating innovative technology for remote biomechanical assessment.
The central hypothesis is iGET Living will be acceptable and feasible for youth with chronic MSK pain and their
parents and will be effective at alleviating functional disability and pain-related distress. Agile research methods
will allow for a rapid, iterative development and evaluation of the intervention, yielding a clinically useful solution.
This proposal includes a comprehensive training plan under the guidance of mentors with expertise across study
aims. Dr. Harrison will obtain specialized training in 1) user-centered design and agile development of digital
interventions, 2) clinical research and trial execution, 3) intervention optimization, dissemination, and
implementation science, 4) innovative, remote assessment of biomechanical function, 5) advanced qualitative
and quantitative statistics, and 6) experiential learning in grant-writing. Research: Aim 1: In an iterative, user-
experience design process, Dr. Harrison and her team will develop iGET Living for adolescents with chronic
MSK pain and their parents. Data regarding comprehensiveness and acceptability will be collected via interviews
with patients and parents. Clinicians specialized in pediatric chronic pain will provide feedback on how providers
might integrate into practice, who they would refer, and potential barriers to utilization. Aim 2: Dr. Harrison will
evaluate preliminary feasibility and effectiveness of iGET Living to reduce pain-related distress and functional
disability utilizing SCED with multiple measures. Successful completion of these aims will provide the opportunity
to rapidly evaluate treatment effectiveness and inform iterative development of iGET Living to prepare
subsequent RCTs. The strong mentorship team, specialized career development training, and proposed
research plan will allow Dr. Harrison to gain the expertise needed to seek R-level funding and achieve her long-
term career goal of becoming an independent clinician-scientist with expertise in developing digital interventions
for youth with chronic pain and their parents."

Evidence suggests quality of care has substantially improved in the in the US has over last 25 years. However,
wide variability exists in the quality of care that some patient groups receive. Some suggest that structural
barriers in within healthcare systems and in post-discharge community settings translate into racial-ethnic
disparities in outcomes for conditions such as aphasia and dysphagia. To date, studies have not examined the
role structural barriers play role in disparities in outcomes. In this study we propose to test the hypothesis that
structural barriers at various stages of the post-stroke treatment condition for conditions like aphasia and
dysphagia contribute to differences in quality of rehabilitation care and subsequently to racial-ethnic differences
in aphasia and dysphagia outcomes. The objective of this study is to examine how healthcare institutions and
healthcare provider practices impacts the receipt of quality rehabilitative care and whether it translates into racial
disparities in post-stroke outcomes. The objective of this project will be achieved by the completion of the
following specific aims: Aim 1: Determine how availability, accessibility, and quality of post-stroke acute
inpatient care contribute to disparate outcomes of individuals with aphasia and dysphagia. We
hypothesize that processes embedded in healthcare settings and communities where stroke survivors live will
dictate: a) access to specific types of care, b) the path of care progression, and c) intensity of care. Aim 2:
Determine how the timing and transition of care contribute to disparate outcomes of individuals with
aphasia and dysphagia. We hypothesize that processes embedded in healthcare settings will lead to variations
in the timing and transition from acute to post-acute care of stroke survivors with aphasia and dysphagia as they
move across different facilities/systems of care. Aim 3: Determine how the post-discharge community
environments contribute to disparate outcomes of individuals with aphasia and dysphagia. We
hypothesize that personal, social, and community measures of prosperity and disadvantage will contribute to
racial disparities in outcomes among individuals with aphasia and dysphagia. To complete this study we will use
Medicare claims data which will enable us to track the care of stroke survivors with aphasia and dysphagia
across the entire continuum of care."

The HIV-1 reservoir is a stable pool of latently infected CD4+ T cells that rekindles viral replication even after
decades of antiretroviral therapy (ART). ART alone is not curative, requiring life-long treatment for people living
with HIV-1 (PLWH). The main strategies attempted so far to eliminate HIV-1-infected cells face multiple
challenges, including the selection of escape variants, resistance to apoptosis, T cell exhaustion, downregulation
of MHC-I by HIV-1, and localization of infected cells in immune sanctuaries. This research program has the long-
term goal of developing new therapeutic approaches to eliminate or control the HIV reservoir, leading to a drug-
free remission. We recently discovered that the inflammasome protein CARD8 senses the enzymatic activity of
the HIV-1 protease. We demonstrated that non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) such as
efavirenz (EFV) promote dimerization of Gag-Pol and cause premature intracellular activation of protease. HIV-
1 protease cleaves CARD8 driving the formation of caspase-1-dependent inflammasome and pyroptosis. All
clinical HIV-1 isolates can be sensed by CARD8 despite viral diversity because it recognizes essential protease
functions. The overall objective of this application is to harness CARD8 inflammasome to develop a novel
approach to enhance HIV-1 reservoir elimination independently of CTLs or antibodies and trigger cell killing
through non-apoptotic cell death. The underlying central hypothesis is that EFV-induced activation of CARD8, in
combination with CARD8-enhancing drugs, can clear cells with transcriptionally active proviruses, reduce viral
reservoir expansion, and gradually remove proviruses integrated into euchromatin regions. The rationale for the
project is that enhancing the negative selection forces will reshape the proviral landscape, accelerate its decay,
and reduce viral reactivation. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Establish
EFV-induced CARD8 activation and killing of expanding HIV reservoir cells upon stimulation with cognate
antigens ex vivo; 2) Determine the impact of EFV on HIV-1 reservoirs in humanized mice; and 3) Investigate the
impact of EFV on HIV-1 reservoirs in PLWH in vivo by studying banked samples from clinical trials. The research
proposed in this application is innovative because, compared to the status quo, it focuses on a new mechanism
independent from HIV-1 diversity and cell susceptibility to apoptosis. The proposed research is significant
because it is expected to provide the groundwork for the development of a new curative strategy that is scalable,
broadly applicable in different contexts of clinical research, and can be easily combined with other interventions
aiming to achieve HIV-1 remission. At completion, the proposed work will inform future pre-clinical and clinical
research on the development of new antiretroviral compounds that can potently eliminate HIV-1-infected cells
by activating CARD8-sensing of HIV-1 protease activity."
10891662,"This K24 grant renewal is requested to support the mentoring activities of Dr. Maria Luisa Gorno Tempini, a
behavioral neurologist and cognitive neuroscientist. Dr. Gorno Tempini is a leading researcher and clinician in
the fields of neurology and the neuroscience of language, with specific expertise in atypical neurodegenerative
diseases that present as speech and language disorders. She mentors a talented group of clinicians and
researchers to study and treat Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA) and investigate the neural basis of language.
Dr. Gorno Tempini has a proven track record of success in mentoring both clinicians and scientists in patient-
oriented research (POR) related to speech and language disorders.
The goals of this proposal are to support time for Dr. Gorno Tempini to mentor a growing number of increasingly
diverse clinicians and researchers interested in neurodegenerative language disorders, to extend her impact as
a mentor at UCSF, and to pursue novel lines of research in PPA. Leveraging the resources available at the
UCSF Memory and Aging Center (MAC), the Global Brain Health Institute, and the UCSF Clinical and
Translational Science Institute, she will mentor clinicians, faculty, postdoctoral scholars, and scientists with
particular attention to cultivating diversity, equity, and inclusion in her laboratory, the university, and the
profession at large. She will sustain her comprehensive mentoring system that features one-on-one mentoring,
supervision of clinicians in patient diagnosis and care, and group mentoring activities. She will update and extend
that system with opportunities for training with colleagues in speech and data science and a focus on mentoring
more advanced junior colleagues as emerging mentors themselves. Dr. Gorno Tempini's experience in basic
cognitive neuroscience and neurological methodologies and her increasingly nuanced leadership expertise
uniquely position her to benefit a diverse group of trainees.
The research project proposed here will develop automatic, efficient, and objective methods to measure speech
production in PPA. The study will apply acoustic analysis scripts and automatic speech recognition to five
minutes of audio recordings collected from 500 well-characterized PPA patients and employ dynamic speech
MRI to identify anatomical biomarkers of vocal tract movements corresponding to speech articulation errors. This
will lead to earlier detection of speech deficits; improved characterization of clinical syndromes; and more
detailed, objective, and efficient outcome measures to track progression and, in the future, response to
treatment. Machine learning analyses of acoustic measures and imaging data collected through other MAC
projects will provide novel tools for prediction of post-mortem pathology and new knowledge on the neural basis
of speech.
This grant will be instrumental in supporting the pursuit of Dr. Gorno Tempini's goals to mentor the next
generation of clinician scientists in the neurology of language and neurodegenerative aphasias."
10874435,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Exposure to psychosocial stress has widespread deleterious effects on the body and brain that lead to
the development of many physiological and neuropsychiatric disorders. Importantly, conditions such as anxiety
and opioid use disorder (OUD) are two of the most common stress comorbidities that not only cause drastic
effects on the patient but also represent an extreme public health crisis. Notably, females often suffer from these
conditions at twice the rate of men, but research into the potential sex differences that allow for this susceptibility
has traditionally been under studied. Further, the underlying neural mechanisms by which stress confers
susceptibility to future psychiatric illness has not been fully explored. The overall goal of this project is to
determine the neural alterations induced by psychosocial stress in discrete stress-sensitive brain regions in
animal models utilizing both male and female rats. Specifically, these experiments aim to investigate
neuroimmune signaling within the locus coeruleus (LC) to determine how stress-induced alteration of microglial
activation influences noradrenergic output and subsequent anxiety-like and drug seeking behaviors. Increased
neuroimmune signaling in this brain region has been associated with increased norepinephrine (NE) output, but
the downstream impact of stress-induced microglial alterations of LC-NE activity on projection regions involved
in the control of anxiety and drug seeking behaviors has not been assessed. Therefore, these experiments have
been designed to test the hypothesis that stress exposure augments microglial signaling within the LC which, in
turn, affects noradrenergic tone in downstream regions including the basolateral amygdala (BLA), a region
known for its control of anxiety- and drug-related behaviors. This hypothesis will be tested using a variety of
techniques including behavioral pharmacology, chemogenetics, and microdialysis to modulate and measure the
impact of stress-induced LC microglial activation on anxiety-like and opioid seeking behaviors. Male and female
rats will be exposed to our model of vicarious social stress, witness stress, where a rat experiences the sensory
and psychological aspects of a social defeat encounter. Aim 1 is designed to determine the effects of LC
microglia modulation, through intra-LC DREADD mediated inactivation of microglia, on anxiety-like and opioid
reinstatement behaviors using marble burying and opioid conditioned place preference testing. These animals
will also be implanted with microdialysis probes within the BLA for Aim 2 which is designed to determine the
downstream effects of LC microglial modulation on NE activity in the BLA. These studies have the potential to
identify novel mediators of maladaptive stress responses that escalate to opioid use disorder with the ultimate
goal of determining preventative treatments for stress-induced comorbidities. These data support the mission of
the NIH in the search for a cure for the opioid epidemic and allows for the training necessary to create an
independent scientist that will continue to pursue this goal throughout their career."
10840294,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Assembly of dsDNA viruses, including the tailed bacteriophages, herpesviruses, and adenoviruses, is a highly
coordinated process involving a series of protein interactions that lead to the formation of an infectious virion. The
central goal of this research is to achieve a detailed mechanistic understanding of the specific
protein:protein interactions that govern this assembly process. During assembly, proteins interact
temporally, driven by their conformational plasticity. The dodecameric portal protein complex, which is essential
for tailed dsDNA virus assembly, exemplifies this. In bacteriophage P22, a model for dsDNA viruses, scaffolding
protein drives the oligomerization of portal protein monomers into rings which are subsequently incorporated into
procapsids (PCs). Terminase proteins then preferentially bind the PC conformation of portal, and package DNA
until the head is full. At this point, portal undergoes a conformational switch to its mature virion (MV) form that
triggers the release of the terminase proteins and the binding of proteins that stopper the portal channel resulting
in the complete MV. Portal takes on another distinct conformation from its PC and MV forms after the virion
injects its DNA into host cells. Despite the portal complex being critical for successful virion assembly, owing to
it being the conduit for DNA translocation, its roles during DNA packaging and signaling for the completion of
packaging have not been mechanistically defined. The central hypothesis is that conformational changes of the
portal complex are required to regulate the processes involved in successful viral maturation. I will test this
hypothesis using bacteriophage P22 which provides an excellent dsDNA model assembly system. Overall, its
simple genetics and well-established biochemistry offer advantages over more complex dsDNA viruses. The
experiments proposed in Aim 1 will elucidate the signal for DNA packaging completion by interrogating portal
protein variants’ ability to make infectious phages with the appropriate morphology that package the correct
amount of DNA. In Aim 2, I will obtain the cryo-EM structure of the portal complex bound to terminase, which
has not been solved at high-resolution. Collectively, these data will represent a significant advancement of our
understanding of the dsDNA viral assembly pathway by shedding light on how conformational changes of portal
drive DNA packaging. Overall, elucidation of the details involved in P22 assembly can lead to the identification
of potential anti-viral drug target sites to inhibit assembly of dsDNA human pathogens."

Subcortical targets involved in the action of psilocybin in learned and innate escape behaviors
PROJECT SUMMARY
 Mood disorders such as depression now represent a leading cause of disability throughout the world,
with conventional first-line treatments failing to provide relief for most patients. In recent years, novel
treatments with fast-acting properties have garnered significant interest as innovative therapies. The
psychedelic psilocybin, in particular has recently gained attention for its ability to produce substantial and rapid
antidepressant effects in early-phase clinical trials. This combination of increasing need and exciting
preliminary clinical results has led to the recent ‘breakthrough therapy’ status designation for psilocybin to be
studied as a treatment for major depressive disorder. Yet despite these exciting results in pilot clinical trials, the
neurobiology underlying the effect of psilocybin remains less understood. Thus, a critical opportunity to further
our understanding of the action of psilocybin will be addressed here.
 Among early studies examining the mechanisms of action of psilocybin, most have focused on the
neocortex and hippocampus. However, previous cellular and circuit-level research has clearly implicated
subcortical structures as key in the action of psilocybin. Our own preliminary work using whole-brain cFos
mapping has identified several candidate subcortical regions that are modulated by psilocybin. Aim 1 will
determine the activity of two of these key subcortical brain regions via in vivo recording with high-density silicon
probes to determine how neural activity changes following systemic psilocybin administration. Aim 2 will use
causal manipulation during psilocybin treatment to determine the relative role of subcortical regions during
innate and learned escape behaviors in mice. Specifically, chemogenetics will be used to bidirectionally control
brain region activity during a looming stimulus and learned escape behavioral paradigms. Cumulatively, this
work will determine the relative roles of key subcortical brain regions in the action of psilocybin during escape
behaviors and expand the framework for psilocybin’s use in clinical treatment."
10840801,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Alphaviruses are arthropod-transmitted viruses that cause acute febrile illness in humans, with some
cases causing long-term skeletomuscular and neurological sequelae. Currently there are no FDA-approved
vaccines or therapeutics for alphavirus infection, and continued global outbreaks of chikungunya and Eastern
equine encephalitis virus highlight the need for medical countermeasures. Effective antiviral treatments target
key viral replication processes without host side-effect are built on the foundational knowledge of viral replication
as evidenced by the rapid development of RNA polymerase and viral protease inhibitors towards SARS-CoV-2
during the COVID-19 pandemic. While alphaviruses have been studied for decades, there are many foundational
gaps in our understanding of their biology. Like all viruses, alphavirus infection of host cells induces a
multifaceted innate immune response, of which one result is the activation of the integrated stress response
(ISR) through viral double-stranded RNA sensing by host protein kinase R (PKR) and subsequent
phosphorylation of translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2a), causing shutoff of global protein translation. However,
alphaviruses have evolved a mechanism by which their structural proteins are uniquely still efficiently translated
from the viral subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) during ISR activation. While many canonical translation initiation factors
have been ruled dispensable for sgRNA translation, the mechanism of sgRNA translation is yet to be described.
Interestingly, the resistance of the sgRNA to the ISR is only observed in infected cells, suggesting viral factors
are necessary. Other work has shown that viral nonstructural protein nsP3 interacts with components of stress
granules, organelles formed during ISR activation to sequester translation machinery until relief of the stress and
return to homeostasis, suggesting a role for nsP3 in modulating translation during alphavirus infection-induced
ISR. Together, this leads to the hypothesis that alphaviruses evade the ISR through recruitment of non-canonical
initiation factors or the ribosome directly, and that ISR resistance is mediated in part through interactions of the
nsP3 and host proteins.
 Using Sindbis virus (SINV) as a model system, this proposal seeks to identify how alphaviruses evade
the ISR to maintain translation of viral structural proteins with hopes of identifying druggable targets to prevent
alphavirus replication and spread. Aim 1 seeks to identify translation initiation factors responsible for sgRNA
translation during ISR activation and eIF2a phosphorylation. Aim 2 will address the role of viral factors,
specifically the hypervariable domain (HVD) of nsP3, in modulating the ISR and sgRNA translation through use
of deep mutational scanning methods. Successful completion of this proposed work will provide mechanistic
insight for an under-characterized phenomenon observed for decades in alphavirus research, allowing for novel
therapeutic interventions for alphavirus infections."
10798169,"Project Summary
Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent and impairing early childhood disorder that
presents notable challenges to normative development and can be reliably identified starting at preschool age,
with risk captured as early as toddler age when employing developmentally based assessments. Identification
of concerning attention dysregulation development, before frank disorder presents, could ameliorate negative
cascades associated with emergent ADHD syndromes and impairment. Further, recent research points to
pervasive, early onsetting mental health inequities, evident in patterns of emergent ADHD, and the need for
equitable assessment to reduce bias in predictive risk modeling (i.e., accounting for protective factors in
addition to risks, modeling specific risk indicators, rather than taking race as a proxy thereof). Thus, the current
project seeks to characterize developmental change and its sociodemographic context in patterns of attention
(dys)regulation across toddlerhood with outcomes at preschool age. This work draws on novel, clinically
translatable research tools capturing the typical:atypical spectrum of neurodevelopmental and behavioral
indicators of attention (dys)regulation: parent survey and standardized clinical observation. The project
engages a community-based sample of children recruited at their first annual well-child visits and oversampled
for psychopathology risk (i.e., irritability). Initial examination of outcomes at later timepoints indicates that the
sample is well characterized for ADHD symptoms with prevalence matching other community samples. Under
this award, I will train in innovative methods of longitudinal modeling (i.e., multilevel and group-based trajectory
modeling) to generate models of data collected densely at toddler age, predicting developmental patterns to
emergent ADHD outcomes at preschool age(3-5 years). In alignment with an equitable assessment approach,
structural equation models examining structural and familial risks and protective factors will more richly
characterize pathways to emergent ADHD symptoms at preschool age. This project seeks to characterize
neurodevelopmental vulnerability to ADHD at the earliest point in the developmental sequence, establishing an
empirically grounded, equitable approach to assessment and conceptualization of early risk."
10904833,"Prediction of Heart Failure Onset using Multimodal Data Analysis, Deep
Learning and Commercial Wearables
Project Summary/Abstract
Research: Heart failure is one of the leading causes of mortality and drivers of healthcare costs in the United
States. By 2030, the number of heart failure patients is projected to reach 8 million. If we could predict who will
develop heart failure, this would create an opportunity to improve patient experiences and outcomes by
initiating earlier behavioral and therapeutic interventions. Electronic health records (EHR) contain information
that can be used to predict heart failure before its onset. However, the existing models lead to a large number
of false positive predictions, limiting their clinical utility. The PI proposes to augment the EHR data with
electrocardiogram (ECG) and heart rate variability (HRV) features to improve the accuracy of predicting the
onset of heart failure 12 months in advance. The three modalities of data (EHR, ECG and HRV) will be
analyzed using deep learning methods, including novel techniques proposed by the PI. The models will be
developed and validated retrospectively using patient data available at Michigan Medicine. The second aim of
the proposal is to increase the impact of this research by replacing the clinically measured ECG and HRV with
those obtained by consumer wearables such as smart watches. A prospective cohort of patients will wear a
wearable device for seven days, which will allow the PI to determine whether the collected information
(intermittent ECG, continuous HRV derived from photoplethysmography, and actigraphy), combined with EHR,
can provide clinicians with a more effective tool to identify which patients are at risk of heart failure. While this
approach will benefit a larger population of patients, it will still be limited to those with past medical history. To
further expand the impact of this research to those who wear consumer wearables but have no previous
medical history, a limited model that depends only on the information gathered by the wearable device will be
evaluated. Thus, the outcomes of this study will include multiple models targeting various populations, such as
those with and without prior medical history. Candidate / Career Development: Dr. Sardar Ansari is a computer
scientist and statistician with expertise in biomedical signal processing, machine learning, and medical
wearable devices. His past research experience includes analysis of ECG signal to improve detection of
cardiac arrhythmias and reduce false alarms in intensive care units; detection and removal of noise and motion
artifacts in biomedical signals such as ECG and bioimpedance; prediction of hemodynamic decompensation
using HRV; and detection of hemorrhagic shock, intradialytic hypotension, and low cardiac index using
wearable technology. This award will allow Dr. Ansari to acquire needed additional training in cardiovascular
physiology and heart failure pathophysiology through mentorship, didactic training, attending workshops and
scientific meetings, and clinical exposure, preparing him for an independent career focused on developing
diagnostic and clinical decision support tools for cardiovascular medicine."
10709548,"This study will develop and test the feasibility and limited-efficacy of a combined physical activity (PA)
and cognitive-behavioral therapy intervention (bCBT) for Veterans with COPD, emotional distress (clinically
significant depression and anxiety), and low PA level. Prior research has shown that combined PA+CBT
interventions produce superior physical and emotional outcomes in heart failure and diabetes patients.
Drawing from this body of literature, we will develop and test the feasibility and limited-efficacy of an integrated
PA+CBT intervention (Step-CBT) tailored and adapted to COPD patients and delivered via VA Video Connect
(VVC).
 Step-CBT will be an integrated intervention based on established interventions: pedometer-based PA
intervention and bCBT. In order to develop Step-CBT, we will first conduct mixed-methods interviews with
(n=20) Veterans with COPD. Mixed-methods data will identify target behaviors, emotions, and cognitions
related to emotional distress and PA, and we will integrate this content with existing content included in
pedometer-based PA intervention and bCBT. We will provide specific language based on patients' lived
experience and mirror the language they use to describe their experience. We will tailor examples, home
exercises, and psychoeducation based on the data we collect. We will adapt to delivery over VVC. Step-CBT
will then be tested for acceptability with (n=5) Veterans. Acceptability data will be reviewed and submitted to
the multidisciplinary expert panel for review and modifications of the treatment protocol will be made based on
this process.
 Next, Step-CBT will be delivered to Veterans (n=32) compared to enhanced usual care (UC; n = 16)
matched for social interaction enrolled through 2:1 randomization for feasibility and limited-efficacy testing with
a two week run-in period. Step-CBT will target primary outcomes of step count and patient-reported disability
(LLDFI Disability Component), and secondary outcomes of emotional distress (PHQ-9 and BAI). We will
measure within-group change in Step-CBT (n=32) and usual care (n=16) groups from baseline to post-
assessment (Week 15). We will also compare between-group differences across outcomes. When available,
minimally important differences will be used to guide analyses. This study will leverage advances in telehealth
interventions. Step-CBT will be deliverable to Veterans' home bypassing numerous barriers to hospital-based
care and increasing access to more Veterans with COPD. Pilot data from this CDA-2 will be used inform the
design and methodology of a future Merit submission.
 Advanced education and training is required in four areas: 1) Pulmonary Rehabilitation and COPD; 2)
Science of behavior change; Methodology and Statistics; and 4) Career Development. The combination of
didactic and experiential training in these areas will serve the PI's long-term goal of becoming an independent
clinician-investigator at VA Boston focused on the development of innovative combined physical
activity/rehabilitation interventions and mental health interventions, to optimize physical functioning in aging
Veterans with chronic disease and physical disability. In the shorter-term, this CDA-2 will provide a feasible,
patient-centered intervention that can be incorporated into existing systems of care and supplement hospital-
based pulmonary rehabilitation."

To continue to make progress for pediatric oncology patients, we need to perpetuate the pool of talented and
trained pediatric oncology-hematology physician-scientists who will make relevant discoveries and provide
investigative leadership. This has become ever more challenging in the field of pediatric oncology, as there
continues to be a shortage of young investigators with extensive laboratory research expertise. Fortunately, we
are able to attract candidates willing to spend the time in the laboratory under the tutelage of outstanding
investigators who are able to inculcate them with the culture of research that predominates at Johns Hopkins
Medical (JHM) and the National Cancer Institute (NCI), despite the current challenging funding climate. This
grant, institutional funds, and additional funding obtained by many trainees after two years in the laboratory
allows the large majority of trainees to continue for at least three years, with many staying on at the Instructor
level for additional time until they are fully ready to establish their own laboratory. In the current funding period
(07/2018 – 09/2022), this grant has supported superb laboratory research training for an outstanding group of
17 physician-scientists (12 MD and 5 MD/PhD) who have demonstrated a high degree of productivity and
commitment to careers in cancer research. Three of the MDs enrolled in a PhD graduate program while also
receiving T32 training, and we anticipate more will do so in the future. This application seeks continued support
for 8 interdisciplinary postdoctoral research positions per year. On average, we anticipate that 3 new trainees
will be appointed to this T32 Program each year. These highly selected physician-scientists will have completed
the clinical year of their fellowship. These strongly qualified trainees will be provided intensive three-year
research experiences that will prepare them for careers in cancer research. Trainees work on projects relevant
to the full range of childhood cancers, in the laboratories of leading scientists. Areas of faculty research expertise
include pediatric leukemias, lymphomas, sarcomas, brain tumors, neuroblastoma, cancer genetics and
epigenetics, cancer immunotherapy, stem cell transplantation, and small molecule drug development. The T32
trainees will receive extensive mentorship, not only from their primary laboratory mentor but also from the T32

10914901,"Moderate-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) results in physical, behavioral, and cognitive impairments that can have a devastating impact on functioning in the community. Comprehensive interdisciplinary inpatient rehabilitation can maximize function and reduce complications. However, clinicians and researchers are unable to answer the question, “Which of the wide range of rehabilitation practices can most effectively advance recovery and improve outcomes?” Due to the complexity of the rehabilitation process and the heterogeneity of the TBI patient population, the standard approach to comparative effectiveness research, the randomized controlled trial, is inadequate. Nevertheless, with growing limitations on healthcare resources and shorter lengths of stay, it is urgent and critical to identify the specific rehabilitation approaches that can optimize outcomes for persons with TBI.  A pragmatic, prospective observational study to close this evidence gap is proposed. By leveraging the infrastructure of the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living and Rehabilitation Research’s TBI Model Systems, the largest longitudinal study of moderate-severe TBI in the world, the data needed to compare the effectiveness of different rehabilitation approaches will quickly accumulate. Recent advances in data capture, through electronic medical records (EMR), and in advanced statistical methods provide the avenue by which the complexity of rehabilitation can be scientifically studied. Aim 1: This study aims to leverage EMR technology to ensure data identified as critical to rehabilitation treatment are captured through standardized documentation during the natural course of a patient’s hospitalization. Aim 2: Incorporating the findings of preliminary studies on comparative effectiveness of treatment approaches, this study will aim to evaluate the impact of different approaches to treatment on patient outcomes. It is hypothesized that rehabilitation interventions directly targeting performance of real-life activities (ContextTx) and higher-level functions (AdvTx) will individually and in combination improve community participation at 1-year post-injury, as well as on functional independence at discharge and at 1-year post-injury. Aim 3: Identify time-varying patient and setting factors that can change over the course of rehabilitation and that modify the effects of treatment.  Advanced statistical analyses coupled with data capture made feasible by effectively designed EMR documentation from frontline providers will provide the data necessary to identify which treatment approaches are associated with better patient outcomes. This in turn will arm clinical providers with valuable knowledge to design the most effective treatment plans for patients. The findings of this study will further empower clinical operators with the necessary information to advocate and promote evidence-based treatments for TBI recovery to fiscal stewards, credentialing bodies, and regulatory agencies."
10892208,"ABSTRACT: Glial immune signaling in radiation-induced brain injury.
Cranial radiation therapy (CRT) for the treatment of CNS cancers often leads to unintended and
debilitating cognitive impairments. CRT also remains the standard of care to counter brain
metastases for other invasive cancers. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms
underlying CRT-induced cognitive decline are multifaceted and have not been completely
resolved. Our past findings show that whole-brain, acute CRT induces progressive
neurodegenerative changes, including oxidative stress, reduced neurogenesis, and increased
neuroinflammation. Microglia and astrocytes form complex glial networks in the CNS by pruning
and maintaining thousands of synapses that are actively involved in cognition. Yet, we have
shown that CRT-induced cognitive disruption coincides with astrocytic hypertrophy, elevated
expression of astrogliosis genes, and persistent microglial activation in rodent models. Therefore,
we hypothesize that detrimental glial signaling significantly contributes to cognitive deficits. The
complement system is a potent mediator of the glial activation, but it also has a range of non-
immune functions in the CNS, including synaptic pruning and clearance of apoptotic cells and
cellular debris which is detrimental if dysregulated. Particularly, global elevation in the expression
of complement C1q and C3 in the CNS has been reported in neurodegenerative conditions. Our
findings indicate that acute, whole-brain CRT-mediated chronic microglial activation and reactive
astrocytes, elevated co-expression of complement proteins (C1q, C3) and specific receptors
(C5aR1, TLR4) coincided with cognitive impairments. Reactive gliosis has been shown to
upregulate complement cascade proteins that are destructive to synapses and associated with
neurodegeneration. We hypothesize that brain cancer therapy-induced aberrant activation in the
glial complement cascade leads to cognitive deficits. Our hypothesis is supported by two key
preliminary data sets targeting complement signaling at the upstream (C1q) and the downstream
(C5a) activation branch points. First, exposure of conditional microglia-selective C1q (knockdown)
mice to CRT did not exhibit impaired cognition and showed a lack of neuroinflammation as
compared to irradiated WT mice. Second, treatment with an orally active, BBB permeable, C5a
receptor (C5aR1) antagonist ameliorated acute CRT-induced cognitive deficits and alleviated
microglial activation in the irradiated brain. Our hypothesis will be addressed using a clinically
relevant, fractionated, focal cranial irradiation paradigm ± temozolomide, transgenic and glioma-
bearing syngeneic mouse models, and pharmacologic approaches designed to test mechanisms
and therapeutic interventions to restore cognitive function in the impaired animals."

PROJECT SUMMARY
Protein interactions are involved in nearly all biological processes in human health and diseases, and protein
complex structures can reveal biological mechanisms and suggest intervention strategies. Computational
modeling provides an alternative route to elucidate structures. Modeling also tests our understanding of
molecular biophysics and allows us to engineer molecules based on their structures. My lab is a pioneer in
developing computational methods to predict and design protein–protein interfaces and in applying those
methods broadly, from immunology and cancer to infectious disease and tissue engineering. Our central focus
is on protein–protein docking, that is, predicting the structure of a complex from the components (individual
polypeptides or domains). A longstanding challenge in docking is correctly capturing protein conformational
change, and we lead development of innovative search strategies and rapid scoring schemes to close this gap.
Another focus area is the modeling and design of antibodies, directly supporting drug and diagnostic agent
development and optimization. We predict high-resolution antibody structures from sequence, dock those
models to antigens, and design antibodies to target specific antigens. Several protein modifications are important
to consider when modeling interfaces. The emergence of powerful experimental methods for characterizing
glycans has prompted us to expand our tools to model carbohydrates including docking methods and focused
studies on glycotransferases. All our methods are embedded in the Rosetta software platform, which is used by
tens of thousands of academic and industry scientists worldwide. The utility of our work is evidenced by the high
demand for our prediction and design web server, scripting platform, and teaching materials. By leading the
technical and scientific testing operations for the Rosetta Commons, my lab powers the synergies to combine
Rosetta's powerful biomolecular prediction and design methods across this international collaboration."

certificate program for site biological/infectious agent health and safety. This certificate program will be
targeted towards both working professionals (e.g., industrial hygienists, safety professionals) and students in
the style of a HAZWOPER-type supplement. The time required will be equivalent to a typical HAZWOPER
refresher course (i.e., one 8-hour day) and will instruct participants in topics and techniques related to
biological safety as well as novel and emerging technologies relevant to biological safety. Aim 2 seeks to
successfully develop, implement, and evaluate a collaborative and joint 4+1/graduate research topics
course in site biological/infectious agent health and safety. This course will be offered at all participating
institutions and will focus on emerging techniques and strategies in designing, developing, and integrating
devices, systems, and controls into the site biological safety aspects of environmental characterization, clean-
up, and remediation. Enrolled students will work as interdisciplinary teams with members from each partnering
institution. Each student team will not only have a faculty advisor, but also an inter-institutional committee
made up of at least 3 members. Aim 3 seeks to successfully develop, implement, and evaluate a
collaborative and joint graduate applied topics course utilizing products resulting from the research
course in site biological/infectious agent health and safety. The proposed course will be offered at all
participating institutions and include the necessary rubrics from the 29 CFR 1910.120 OSHA standard for 40-
hour HAZWOPER certification in addition to the additional biological and infectious agent health and safety
supplemental material developed with this proposal."
10893541,"Cardiovascular diseases are leading global causes of death and disability, presenting as interrelated
phenotypes of atherosclerotic vascular disease, heart failure, and arrhythmias. They arise from interactions
between environmental factors and common and rare genetic variants, including relatively common Mendelian
lipid disorders, cardiomyopathies, and arrhythmias that collectively occur in at least 1/100 individuals. The
availability of genetic sequencing is altering clinical management, but a major barrier to the widespread
application of this practice is that the function of the vast majority of variants in key cardiovascular
disease genes is unknown. Variant effect maps that define function for nearly all missense variants in a target
sequence offer a way forward. This project brings together scientists at the forefront of variant effect mapping in
diverse cellular systems, illuminating underlying cardiovascular biology, establishing relationships between
variant function and human phenotypes, and working with others in multi-institutional collaborations. Our
CardioVar team will generate a comprehensive atlas of variant effect maps for key cardiovascular
disease genes.
 In Aim 1, we will develop, optimize, and validate a range of high-throughput cellular assays. We will use a
range of generalizable (e.g. surface abundance) and bespoke (e.g. electrophysiological, lipoprotein uptake)
assays to directly measure variant function in disease-relevant context. Assays will be assessed by their ability
to discriminate pathogenic from benign variants.
 In Aim 2, we will use in situ targeted mutagenesis or insertion of variant constructs at a safe harbor site to
generate pools of cells capturing all single-nucleotide changes in target genes. We will then deploy existing
validated assays and those emerging from Aim 1 to generate and validate variant effect maps at scale. Functional
scores and uncertainty estimates will be derived and evaluated, both by performance on pathogenic and benign
variants and on correlation with discrete and quantitative phenotypes in clinical cohorts.
 In Aim 3, we will derive biological and clinical insights from variant effect maps. Discordant cases, where
variant scores diverge from clinical annotation, will be further investigated in zebrafish, iPSC-cardiomyocytes,
and automated patch clamping systems. Through a combination of hypothesis-driven analysis and machine
learning models, we will reveal relationships among variant effects, protein structure, protein function, and human
phenotypes. To optimize use of the atlas, we will provide a portal serving as a variant-centric decision support
system for evaluating functional evidence of pathogenicity. We will release variant effect map data pre-
publication via MaveDB (that we co-developed) and share all renewable variant assay reagents.
 The CardioVar atlas of missense variant effects, covering key cardiovascular disease genes, will be an
essential and interpretable community resource for clinical and mechanistic studies of cardiovascular disease."
10928199,"The ultimate goal of this project is to improve the mental and physical health of the Blackfeet Nation and to
address our health problems through the development of a sustainable Blackfeet Community College Center
for Culture as Medicine (BCC-CCM). The Blackfeet and other Native peoples experience severe heath
disparities, and, arguably, the best qualified individuals to address these disparities are Native researchers.
However, there are precious few Native investigators with health research expertise and few sustainable health
research centers within Native communities that are controlled by the community. The Blackfeet community
has indicated that one of its primary health concerns is mental health, and it also has indicated the desire for
community members to address this problem themselves. Thus, this capacity building project, entitled BCC-
Student and Faculty Research Development (BCC-SFRD), will enhance the capacity of BCC to develop the
BCC-CCM that will strive to mitigate the high incidence of mental health disease among the Blackfeet
population. Leveraging the work initiated with a previous NARCH capacity building grant, BCC has begun to
build a research culture that has resulted in two scientific publications (1,2), a student research laboratory
capable of biomarker and survey analysis, and an intense interest among BCC faculty and administration and
the Blackfeet community to develop this application. The present project will leverage the progress, interest,
and preliminary data generated from the previous NARCH grant to build the human resources necessary for
the research center, including faculty and student researchers, as well as the means to make the center
sustainable. It also will be important to involve the Blackfeet community in all phases of the development and
function of the proposed center. In order to attain the goal of capacity building, we will accomplish the
following specific aims: 1. strengthen the research culture at BCC, 2. encourage and empower BCC
students to pursue biomedical research careers, and 3. develop a sustainable BCC Mental Health
Research Center at BCC. Previous NARCH funding focused only on capacity building but had significant
impact at BCC, positioning us to develop the present proposal. Thus, this proposal leverages and expands
previous successes. We expect that this proposal, if funded, would have even more impact, propelling BCC to
our goal of enhancing Blackfeet mental health and developing a sustainable BCC-CCM."
10830445,"ABSTRACT
Persistent viral infections involve long-term equilibrium between the pathogen and the immune system. For
this, immune cells must adapt in order to keep the pathogen in check while minimizing immunopathology. This
immune adaptation is best exemplified by “exhausted” CD8 T cells (TEx), which were first described in a model
of murine infection with the persistent lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) isolate Clone 13 (Cl13). In
the same model, TEx were also first shown to progressively lose effector functions, express high levels of
inhibitory receptors such as program-death-1 (PD-1) and be transcriptionally and epigenetically distinct from
other CD8 T cell lineages. TEx were also shown to be a heterogeneous population, with TEx effector-like cells
(TEff-like) and stem-like cells (TEx-Stem) emerging as competing differentiation paths within days after infection. TEff-
like are short-lived and help to contain early viral spread but can also cause immunopathology. In contrast, TEx-
Stem cells self-renew and maintain the TEx pool, being critical for long-term immunity and the success of PD-1-
immunotherapy. Thus, understanding the factors that regulate TEx development and maintenance may offer
unique insights into how we might exploit these TEx subsets to treat sustained viral infections.
White adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT) are both central regulators of whole-body
metabolism. WAT stores energy which can be released via lipolysis and provision of free fatty acids (FFA) in
times of need. In contrast, BAT is a highly metabolically demanding tissue that consumes great quantities of
glucose to maintain core body temperature. Via untargeted metabolomics, we revealed a striking nutritional
shift within the first ten days after LCMV Cl13 infection. In brief, we detected a profound systemic increase in
FFA and a reduction in glucose, which coincided with WAT lipolysis and changes in BAT thermogenesis.
Remarkably, mice with genetic inhibition of WAT lipolysis exhibited reduced FFA, decreased TEx-Stem and
enhanced expression of the effector molecule granzyme B (GrzB). On the other hand, absence of BAT
thermogenesis led to enhanced GrzB and CD8-T-cell-mediated death, while stimulation of BAT thermogenesis
reduced effector CD8 T cells and delayed viral control. These results provide the first evidence that virus-
specific CD8 T cells can be regulated by distant, non-immune, metabolically relevant tissues after an infection.
Our overall goal is to leverage these exciting preliminary data and investigate the unique hypothesis that WAT
(Aim 1) & BAT (Aim 2) regulate CD8 T cell responses during persistent infection through the provision and
restriction of available nutrients (FFA and glucose, respectively), which in turn influence CD8-T-cell metabolism
and differentiation, ultimately affecting the infection outcome. This work will establish the first foundational
principles for a long-distance regulation of antiviral CD8 T cells by metabolically-relevant non-immune tissues,
opening both a paradigm-shifting perspective to consider the host's bioenergetics when studying antiviral
immunity and the possibility of targeting a patient's global metabolism to alleviate infectious diseases."
10912618,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The prognosis for the aggressive histologies in uterine cancer patients is low. This is likely due to lack of
identification of pathways specific to uterine serous cancer or high-grade endometrioid tumors specifically. Our
data suggest that the AXL pathway is highly expressed in uterine serous (USC) and grade 3 endometrioid
endometrial cancer (G3 EEC) is associated with worse survival. We have recently shown that high-affinity,
highly-selective inhibitor of AXL, AVB-500 (now known as batiraxcept), can improve response to paclitaxel in
USC and G3 EEC. Additionally, there is developing data that AXL expression is correlated with the highly
glycolytic phenotype, and this correlation with glycolysis may allow us to determine which tumors can respond
better to AXL inhibition. Furthermore, published data supports that AXL regulates VEGF-A, and our preclinical
data supports that inhibition of AXL can improve response to the anti-angiogenic agent, bevacizumab. Our
central hypothesis is that inhibiting GAS6/AXL with AVB-500 will improve response to standard of care
treatment. We will expand to test this hypothesis in three specific aims.
Aim 1: Determine the safety and tolerability of combining batiraxcept with standard-of-care paclitaxel in
patients with recurrent, aggressive endometrial cancer histologies (USC and G3 EEC).
Exploratory Aim 2: Identify tissue and blood markers that correlate with response to treatment.
Aim 3: Determine the mechanisms by which batiraxcept improves response to the standard-of-care anti-
angiogenic bevacizumab.
Impact: The clinical trial data from Aim 1 will form the foundation of a future Phase II trial of batiraxcept plus
paclitaxel in USC and G3 EEC patients. The data from Exploratory Aim 2 may allow us to develop a metabolic
biomarker that can predict sensitivity to this drug combination and/or provide insight into the metabolic
processes involved in tumors that do not respond to this drug combination. The data from Aim 3 will provide
key mechanistic data to support a future clinical trial combining batiraxcept with bevacizumab. In the long term,
this work will allow us to optimize and personalize treatment for patients with aggressive uterine cancer types.
Our team is well-positioned to test our central hypothesis in clinical and experimental studies."
10912620,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Up to 90% of the ~65,000 women diagnosed with endometrial cancer each year in the U.S. are overweight or
obese, and up to 60% of endometrial cancer cases are attributed to obesity. This is, in large part, because
obesity promotes development of atypical endometrial hyperplasia (AEH), a precursor of grade 1 endometrial
cancer. If diagnosed at one of these stages, a patient can be treated with hysterectomy, which is 100%
effective in preventing/curing endometrial cancer. However, hysterectomy is often unacceptable to
premenopausal women who would like to retain fertility. Instead, such patients are commonly treated with
progestin, most commonly via a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device (IUD). However, up to 41% of
women on progestin eventually experience relapse and require a hysterectomy. Moreover, fewer than 12% of
women who choose this option go on to have a live birth, likely because obesity and the commonly co-
occurring insulin resistance impair fertility. As weight loss alone can also reverse AEH and grade 1 endometrial
cancer, an ideal treatment for premenopausal women desiring future fertility would be to simultaneously
provide a progestin IUD along with an effective weight loss strategy. This Early detection, Prevention and
Population Science project includes two randomized controlled trials testing the overall hypothesis that
combined treatment with progestin and either therapeutic or behavioral weight loss interventions leads to
greater uterine preservation than progestin use alone. Aim 1 is to determine the efficacy of progestin plus a
behavioral weight loss intervention to allow uterine preservation and cancer prevention in premenopausal
women with AEH or grade 1 endometrial cancer. Aim 2 is to determine the efficacy of a glucagon-like peptide 1
receptor agonist plus progestin plus a behavioral weight loss intervention to allow uterine preservation and
cancer prevention in premenopausal women with AEH. The therapeutic drug in this trial is approved by the
FDA for treating obesity. Exploratory Aim 3 is to identify biomarkers that reflect response to progestin plus
weight loss. If this project identifies effective strategies, they can be widely implemented to allow
premenopausal women with AEH or grade 1 endometrial cancer to both avoid cancer and preserve their uterus
for future fertility."

Project 2: Facioscapulohumeral Clinical Trial Foundations
Project 2 will establish facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) clinical trial foundations. The success in
identifying the molecular and genetic mechanisms of FSHD provides a strong basis for drug development and
therapeutic clinical trials. A major barrier to drug development is lack of validated biomarkers for early phase
and proof of concept gene targeted therapies. In addition, the lack of understanding progression over time
limits trial design and clinical care. In our prior Wellstone we showed quantitative fat fraction on MRI can
demonstrate progression over 1-2 years; with certain MRI features (STIR+, and intermediate fatty involvement
at baseline) predicting faster progression rates. The same MRI features also correlated with a basket of FSHD
related genes in needle muscle biopsies – including genes related to DUX4 expression, inflammation, and
extracellular matrix. Here we plan to extend and expand our foundations for clinical trial preparedness. The
broad and long-term goals of this study are to further refine our understanding of MRI as a biomarker by
applying artificial intelligence driven automated segmentation and analyses to existing and new long-term
follow up data, apply our MRI and molecular biomarkers to a safety and tolerability study of clenbuterol, a drug
we identified as inhibiting DUX4 in patient derived cell assays, and using these tools to validate and phenotype
a new large mammal model of FSHD type1. This will be accomplished by (Aim 1) extension of the longitudinal
clinical study cohorts of FSHD to additional long-term functional and MRI assessments with improved MRI
analytic techniques; (Aim 2) perform a prospective 6-month open label multiple ascending dose safety and
tolerability study of clenbuterol in FSHD with secondary outcome measures that include functional studies, MRI
characteristics, muscle histology, and the muscle molecular signature; and (Aim 3) validating a porcine model
of FSHD1 and generating bioresources to support the development of pigs as preclinical models for FSHD.
Together, these aims will (1) further validate, refine, and extend clinical, MRI, and molecular measurements of
disease activity and progression in FSHD muscles to allow for a better understanding of FSHD progression
and the size of change that will be clinically meaningful and ; (2) determine whether clenbuterol is safe and
tolerated, and which dose may show preliminary signs of efficacy to support a future phase II clinical trial; and
(3) validate a new porcine model of FSHD1 using these functional, MRI, and molecular measurements. The
significance of this study is that it will strengthen and extend the foundations for clinical trial design and help
hasten therapeutic development for FSHD."

10877683,"ABSTRACT
Angiogenesis is a central event in nervous system development that requires further elucidation within the
context of the retina. In normal development, retinal angiogenesis initiates from the optic nerve and proceeds
along the innermost layer of retina consisting of retinal nerve fibers and the developing astrocytic network.
Astrocytic development occurs prior to angiogenesis and is critical for guiding the developing vasculature.
Specialized endothelial cells called tip cells crawl along the astrocytes as the angiogenic wavefront advances,
so that the vasculature matches the pattern of astrocyte arbors. It is well understood that astrocytes secrete
VEGF-A in hypoxic zones to initiate angiogenesis, but the signals that advance the wavefront, and guide tip cells
along the astrocyte template, are unknown. The objective of this proposed study is to identify novel astrocyte-
derived molecular cues that guide retinal vascularization. The central hypothesis is that astrocytes provide
molecular cues that promote angiogenesis by 1) enhancing tip cell production; and 2) guiding tip cell growth so
that vasculature adopts the pattern of the astrocyte network. The rationale for this work is to provide a deeper
understanding of glial-mediated regulation of angiogenesis that may be applicable to the entire nervous system
while also providing candidate molecules to target in retinal pathologies such as retinopathy of prematurity
(ROP). The specific aims are: 1) Identify astrocyte-derived cues driving progression of the angiogenic
wavefront. Adrenomedullin (ADM) is a secreted peptide that was previously found to mediate angiogenesis via
its receptor, calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR) in conjunction with receptor activity modifying protein,
RAMP2, which are expressed by endothelial cells. Preliminary single-cell RNA-seq data shows that the
adrenomedullin gene is highly expressed by immature astrocytes. To test this, its angiogenic properties will be
tested utilizing a functional assay that consists of analyzing vasculature wavefront progression in cultured mouse
retinal explants that shall be co-cultured with ADM-expressing HEK293 cells. 2) Identify astrocyte-derived
cues that pattern growing vessels. Genes selectively expressed by astrocytes are candidates to guide tip cell
growth and angiogenesis. To identify such molecules, each cell type in the nerve fiber layer will be purified for
scRNA-seq. Astrocyte-specific genes encoding cell-surface or secreted molecules will be identified
bioinformatically. As in Aim 1, a functional assay using retinal explants will be used to test angiogenic capabilities
of putative tip cell-guiding astrocyte-specific genes. Completion of this work will be significant because it will
reveal novel components and drivers of angiogenesis expressed preferentially by astrocytes in the retina. Such
information will elucidate basic mechanisms of retinal angiogenesis, while also pinpointing important molecular
cues that may be involved in angiogenesis during pathogenic conditions such as ROP."

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the global burden of tuberculosis peaked in 2000 and has
since declined by 2.0% per year. Although this progress is encouraging, tuberculosis remains a leading cause
of death, as over 1.4 million people die per year of the disease. Moreover, low- and middle-income countries
especially in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia bear a disproportionately high burden of tuberculosis
compared to other parts of the world. The overarching goal of this proposal is simple: to reduce the burden of
tuberculosis in sub-Saharan Africa, in particular Uganda. To reach this goal, we believe that we need new metrics
for tuberculosis burden that lead to actionable steps to reduce transmission or prevent progression of infection
to disease. We also need better ways to manage the disease by ensuring proper adherence to effective treatment
regimens to achieve desired clinical outcomes. The current proposal is built upon the premise that digital mobile
technologies, that were not developed with health purposes in mind, may be leveraged in imaginative and novel
ways to provide useful information about tuberculosis transmission, infection, and disease. Indeed, over the past
decade, we have developed a portfolio of research projects using cellular telephone metadata, GPS-enabled
watches, and smartphone video apps to study central questions about tuberculosis persistence in Kampala and
Uganda more broadly. These projects have generated large, complex and interconnected databases that require
a high level of quantitative skills and sophistication to manage and analyze. Yet, the expertise to design studies
and analyze these types of data currently lies in a small group of researchers from diverse disciplines, such as
epidemiology, geography, network science, computing, machine learning and artificial intelligence, among
others. To realize the full potential of digital mobile technologies in measuring useful health information, we
propose to build a critical mass of researchers with expertise across two or more disciplines who are dedicated
to applying new methods to study the longstanding and stubborn questions about the persistence of tuberculosis
in Africa.
To create this critical mass of researchers in Uganda, we propose the following Specific Aims: 1. To train two
Ugandan pre-doctoral trainees at the University of Georgia (UGA) in epidemiology, one with a special focus on
geography of tuberculosis and the other with focus on machine learning and artificial intelligence to enhance
digital adherence technology; 2. To train two to three master’s students per year enrolled at Makerere University
by supporting their master’s thesis research in topics related to tuberculosis and geography, computer science,
or modern digital technologies; 3. To conduct non-degree training to build and strengthen research capacity in
digital mobile technologies and tuberculosis through annual recess-term short courses on relevant topics,
monthly research seminars, and modern digital health technologies symposia at the Ugandan Society of Health
Scientists’ annual conference."
10836366,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Chronic stress contributes to the pathogenesis and exacerbation of numerous disorders
that frequently present with atypical motivation during reward-seeking behavior including substance use disorder
(SUD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and anxiety. The extent to which motivation is disrupted by stress can
depend on the form of stress exposure. Hence, it is critical to understand the neural circuitry regulating motivated
behaviors become disrupted under diverse chronic stress states to improve our understanding of how these
disorders develop, what makes some individuals more susceptible, and to identify more effective molecular
therapeutic targets. Our laboratory previously reported that neurons producing the endogenous opioid peptide
nociceptin in the paranigral ventral tegmental area (pnVTAPnoc neurons) act locally on nociceptin receptor
(NOPR) to limit motivation for reward (Parker et al, Cell, 2019), while others have identified a role for nociceptin
signaling in the orchestrated stress response. Preliminary data show that pnVTA nociceptin neurons are
dynamically engaged to different extents by distinct stressors. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that
stress differentially engages pnVTA nociceptin signaling to regulate the expression of motivated behaviors such
as approach-avoidance. This proposal is in direct response to NIDA’s Strategic Goal 1 which aims to investigate
circuitry contributing to brain functions “such as reward, motivation, decision-making…and stress reactivity, ”
alongside examining a NIDA high priority target for SUD. Aim 1 will determine how diverse physical and
psychological stressors alter the VTA nociceptin opioid system on a molecular and functional level. Aim 1A will
evaluate how various stressors acutely and chronically alter VTA nociceptin/NOPR expression and neuron
activity. Aim 1B uses a new genetically encoded biosensor for the nociceptin peptide (NOPLight), and head-
fixed approach-avoidance (Ap-Av) behavioral models to determine how nociceptin release in the VTA is altered
during Ap-Av decision making following stress exposure. Aim 1C uses prepronociceptin (Pnoc) conditional
knockout line created in-house and optogenetics to manipulate VTA nociceptin peptide expression and activity
following stress. Aim 2 will determine the anatomical and functional involvement of the lateral hypothalamus
(LH) as an afferent input regulating pnVTAPnoc neuron activity in naïve and stressed states using
electrophysiology and fiber photometry to simultaneously record LH terminal activity and nociceptin release in
the VTA following chronic stress exposure. Leveraging these new approaches will enable us to provide brand
new insight into this poorly understood system. During my training period I will learn to utilize cutting-edge
techniques in order to perform powerful, high-resolution investigations of neuropeptide circuitry, and gain
valuable career development training across a host of scientific, intellectual, and mentored programming. This
F31 mechanism will allow me to pursue my individual development plan and prepare me for a career as an
independent neuroscientist."
10871686,"Project Summary/Abstract
 α-Synuclein is a small, soluble neuronal protein that is the primary component of the Lewy body aggregates
that are the hallmark of Parkinson's disease. While the mechanistic details are not yet well-understood,
emerging evidence suggests that cell-to-cell transmission of toxic forms of α-Synuclein is the basis of disease
propagation. Our lab has recently identified complex N-linked glycans as mediators of cellular internalization of
both monomer and aggregate forms of α-Synuclein bearing an N-terminal acetyl group, a physiological
modification of the protein. We specifically identified the neuronal glycoprotein neurexin 1β as capable of
driving internalization of α-Synuclein in a glycan-dependent manner. The goal of our proposed research is to
characterize the structural basis of α-Synuclein binding to neurexin 1β, the role of both N-terminal acetylation
and glycosylation in conferring specificity in this interaction, and determine the molecular mechanisms resulting
cellular internalization of α-Synuclein following binding neurexin 1β. Our hypothesis is that cell-to-cell
transmission of αS is dependent on interactions with neurexin 1β and that the selectivity in these interactions is
dependent on transient structural changes in α-Synuclein conferred by the N-terminal acetyl group. To
investigate this hypothesis, we have developed three specific aims with the following goals: determine the
structural features of α-Synuclein bound to neurexin 1β, including defining a minimal α-Synuclein construct
required for binding (Aim 1); determine the mechanisms by which binding to neurexin 1β results in cellular
internalization of α-Synuclein (Aim 2); and understand the functional impact of α-Synuclein binding to neurexin
1β (Aim 3). To achieve these goals, we will carry out in vitro coarse grain and high resolution structural
characterization of α-Synuclein:neurexin 1β complexes and use live-cell imaging to quantify internalization of
α-Synuclein and the ability of internalized α-Synuclein to seed aggregation of endogenous α-Synuclein. We
will contrast WT monomer, PD-associated point mutants and fibrillar forms of α-Synuclein. Through this
research we expect to characterize key interactions involved in propagation of α-Synuclein pathology in
Parkinson's disease, as well as to gain insight into the structural features of α-Synuclein:neurexin 1β
complexes. Ultimately, the characterization of α-Synuclein: neurexin 1β interactions carried out through our
studies may provide a new target for Parkinson's disease treatment and serve as the basis identifying novel
small molecule therapeutics."
10892655,"Postnatal lung growth during alveolarization markedly increases gas exchange surface area. Rapid
growth of the pulmonary vasculature during early alveolarization drives distal lung growth. As alveolarization
slows, the vasculature transitions from a phase of angiogenic growth to quiescence, however the molecular
mechanisms regulating this transition remain poorly defined. This gap in knowledge confounds efforts to develop
targeted therapies to treat diseases of dysregulated angiogenesis and impaired alveolarization, including
bronchopulmonary dysplasia, the most common complication of preterm birth. We recently employed single cell
transcriptomics to define endothelial cell (EC) diversity during postnatal lung development and to identify novel
mechanisms regulating pulmonary angiogenesis and quiescence. Our preliminary data identified a tremendous
increase in EC diversity after birth, marked by the appearance of numerous transcriptionally distinct clusters. A
highly proliferative EC cluster is abundant before birth, virtually disappears just after birth, but peaks again at
early alveolarization, a time of exponential pulmonary angiogenesis. The microvascular EC (MEC) broadly
separated into Car4 expressing (Car4+) and Car4- MEC. In contrast with gradual changes in gene expression
in the Car4+ MEC over time, gene expression changed dramatically in the Car4- MEC, with separation of this
population into two transcriptionally distinct clusters of “early” (P1-P7) and “late” (P21) Car4- MEC. High
expression of the paternally imprinted gene-3 (Peg3), a gene expressed by self-renewing progenitor cells,
distinguished the “early” from the “late” Car4- MEC. Peg3 also enhances NFkB signaling, a pathway we
previously identified as essential for pulmonary angiogenesis during early alveolarization. Of note, the expression
of receptor-ligand pairs suggested that cross-talk stemming from the Car4+ MEC may promote pro-proliferative
and pro-angiogenic signaling in the Car4- MEC. Taken together, our data suggest the overall hypothesis that the
early Car4- MEC represent a specialized, highly proliferative and angiogenic EC population required for the rapid
growth of the pulmonary vasculature during early alveolarization, which will be tested through three specific aims.
Aim 1 will utilize transgenic and cell-specific knock out mice, advanced imaging, and loss of function studies in primary
EC to probe the role of Peg3 in promoting proliferation, angiogenesis and NFkB activation in Car4- MEC. Aim 2 will
use FACS sorted Car4+ and Car4- MEC and a novel mouse model permitting targeting of Car4+ MEC to test if
interaction between these two distinct MEC promotes postnatal angiogenesis. Finally, Aim 3 will employ
computational ligand-receptor analysis, ATAC-Seq, and EC-specific knock out mice to determine if chronic
hyperoxia impairs angiogenesis by impairing Car4- MEC proliferation, Peg3-mediated self-renewal and Car4+
and Car4- MEC cross-talk. The successful completion of these studies will provide a deep view of pulmonary
vascular development at single cell resolution, and identify new pathways that may be translated into novel
strategies to enhance lung growth and regeneration in diseases marked by impaired pulmonary angiogenesis."

This project develops, estimates, and simulates a cutting-edge model of the health and economic impacts of
the COVID-19 pandemic and policy responses to it. The model has four original features: First, it allows for
two-way interactions between infections and economic outcomes. These are important because even though
the COVID-19 pandemic is fundamentally a matter of public health, it is essential to account for how the
pandemic and the policy responses to it affect the economy and how, in turn, the economic impacts affect
health, including mental health. Second, it builds policies into a model that accounts for geosocial spread
because the SARS-CoV-2 virus is spread through contact with others and policy decisions in one area affect
the rest of the country. Third, it allows for incidence rates that are measured only through imperfect proxies,
which is particularly important for modeling the prevalence of the virus early in the pandemic in the U.S. as well
as in many parts of the world for the foreseeable future. Lastly, the model accounts for disparate impacts
across demographic groups, which is critical given that the pandemic has had dramatically different effects on
different demographic groups (e.g., by age, gender, race, ethnicity, and living arrangements). This work
extends earlier pilot projects that develop a model with the first and second features. Once complete, the
model will make it possible to identify the best sets of economic and health outcomes, including infections and
mortality, that could have been achieved and the policies that would have produced to those best-case
scenario outcomes. It will make it possible to identify the ways in which actual policies deviated from the best
policies. It will also make it possible to rigorously quantify the health and economic costs of deviating from the
optimal policies overall and for specific demographic groups. In addition to understanding the ways in which
policies and outcomes could have been improved as lessons for future outbreaks and pandemics, the
estimates can quantify the cost of vaccination rates stalling beneath herd immunity levels. The model can be
applied to different countries and to cross-country analysis, and its features are intended to apply to public
health crises more generally, such as the opioid epidemic. The ability to apply the model to other epidemics will
allow policy makers to “compare and contrast” the impacts of different epidemics as well as the same epidemic
in different locations using a common approach. Additionally, the project conducts several less structured
analyses that document the health and labor market impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the policy
responses to it. This work will generate results of interest in their own right as policy makers weigh and
measure the efficacy of public health responses, will help identify key phenomena to incorporate into our

 Heart failure (HF) is a critical public health issue that affects over 5 million US adults and imposes an
enormous clinical, social, and economic burden. Over half of individuals with HF have HF with preserved ejection
fraction (HFpEF). Furthermore, HFpEF is highly heterogeneous, and different pathologic mechanisms contribute
to symptoms and poor outcomes in several different subgroups of the disease. Although several largescale
randomized trials have been performed, no pharmacological therapies have been identified that improve
symptoms or clinical outcomes in patients with HFpEF. Our group and others have identified that novel
approaches to deeply phenotyping patients with HFpEF can identify subgroups of patients with HFpEF that are
likely to benefit from targeted therapy.
 The overarching goal of the current proposal is to establish a large cohort of deeply phenotyped patients
with HF with a focus on patients with HFpEF. We propose establishing a cohort of 1000 patients across all 4
Penn clinical centers: 700 patients with HFpEF, 200 patients with HFrEF (including 100 patients with mid-range
LV EF, 40-50%) and 100 non-HF patients with hypertension (a suitable control population, given that most
patients with HFpEF have a history of hypertension). We will incorporate comprehensive clinical data,
socioeconomic data (particularly as they relate to social determinants of health), patient-centered data (such as
quality of life and functional status), structural and mechanistic cardiac and extracardiac phenotypes (including
in-lab characterization and innovative ambulatory approaches to data collection) and multi-omics approaches.
The phenotypic data will be complemented by contemporary bioinformatic approaches to enhance our
understanding of human HFpEF.
 Our phenotyping protocol will provide the opportunity for cross-sectional comparisons against other
groups above, application of within-group clustering approaches, as well as establishing a comprehensively
characterized large prospective cohort of patients with strictly adjudicated HFpEF for prospective follow-up of
hard outcomes. In these patients, we will assess detailed cardiac and extracardiac phenotypes, electronic health
record data, patient-reported outcomes, aerobic adaptations to exercise, and plasma and urinary proteomics
and metabolomics and micro RNAs. We will also assess key ambulatory phenotypes including innovative
approaches to home blood pressure monitoring, physical activity, sleep duration and quality, and important social
determinants of health. Heart failure outcomes will be prospectively adjudicated, including heart-failure related
hospitalization, death, myocardial infarction and stroke. Our analytic approach will include hypothesis-based
research as well as unbiased discovery approaches that will leverage contemporary bioinformatics tools but will
be subject to expert interpretation by members of the Steering Committee, investigator teams at the other Clinical
Centers, and scientific community at large."
10907511,"The DiPersio Unit strives to optimize immunotherapy, including allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation (alloHSCT), for treating hematological malignancies. HSCT is the only curative therapy for many
hematological malignancies and some non-malignant diseases such as hemoglobinopathies, autoimmune
diseases, and inherited disorders of metabolism. Key obstacles to the success of HSCT include collecting
sufficient numbers of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) to proceed to transplant, control of graft-
versus-host disease (GvHD), and treating disease recurrence both before and especially after HSCT. Dr.
DiPersio has focused over the last 25 years on overcoming these obstacles to HSCT through a bench-to-bedside
and back again research approach. I have been fortunate to spend my entire 20-year post-graduate research
career working with Dr. DiPersio. During this time, I contributed to 37 of Dr. DiPersio’s peer-reviewed
manuscripts, performed pre-clinical studies for five projects that led to first-in-human clinical trials, completed
correlative studies for 21 different clinical trials involving over 550 patients, and assisted in the training of 12
post-docs/fellows and nine technicians. Dr. DiPersio’s research program over the next several years will use our
strengths in preclinical modeling, cancer genomics and the design and execution of early phase clinical trials to
(1) develop novel methods for HSPC mobilization and GvHD treatment; (2) define the genetic and epigenetic
changes that contribute to AML relapse after alloHSCT; and (3) perform clinical trials testing bispecific antibody
or chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CART) therapies to treat hematological malignancies before or after HSCT.
Successful HSCT requires the infusion of an adequate number of HSPCs that are capable of homing to the bone
marrow and regenerating hematopoiesis in a timely fashion. We have developed novel polyethylene glycol
(PEG)-conjugated small molecule inhibitors of the integrin very late antigen 4 (VLA-4) and demonstrated that
they synergistically mobilize HSPCs in mice and non-human primates when combined with plerixafor, a CXCR4
inhibitor. In research program 1, I am testing the efficacy of long-acting versions of our PEGylated VLA-4
inhibitors to (1) mobilize murine HSPCs when combined with BL-8040, a long-acting CXCR4 inhibitor and (2)
treat GvHD after alloHSCT when given alone or in combination with baricitinib, a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor. In research
program 2, I am defining minor histocompatibility antigens (mHAs) in mice and man and examining if relapse
after alloHSCT is mediated in part via downregulation or loss of immunogenic mHAs. Since 30%-50% of post-
alloHSCT AML relapses exhibit MHC Class II downregulation, I am examining the mechanisms of MHCII
downregulation in AML and developing approaches to re-induce MHCII on these immunologically cloaked
tumors. In research program 3, I am completing correlative studies for trials evaluating the efficacy of
Flotetuzumab, a CD123´CD3 bispecific antibody, in patients with AML who relapse after chemotherapy or
alloHSCT and testing if CART therapy can be enhanced via administration of long-acting human IL-7 (NT-I7)."

In this study we seek to understand how genetic factors influence the risk of developing obsessive-compulsive
disorder (OCD) in Latin American individuals. OCD and related disorders are of major public health importance
owing to their profound personal and societal costs. Little is known for certain about their etiology, and
treatment, detection and prevention strategies are not optimal or directed by knowledge of pathophysiology. In
other psychiatric disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism), genomics has begun to deliver
fundamental knowledge about genetic architecture, identify specific loci for biological follow-up and localize
pathways altered in disease. We intend to realize these same advances for OCD by markedly increasing and
diversifying the worldwide sample size for genomic analysis, in a first step toward elucidating the fundamental
biology of this condition.
Three overlapping areas will be investigated in this project. First, we will collect the world’s largest ancestrally-
diverse sample of OCD cases (N = 5,000 individuals from Latin America). To do this in an efficient and cost-
effective manner, we will take advantage of a network of OCD clinics we have established across Latin
America, in addition to clinics in the USA and web-based recruitment. The phenotypic data collected will
include a detailed clinical characterization including comorbidities and OCD symptom dimensions. Second, we
will genotype all 5,000 samples on the Illumina Global Screening Array (genotypes for >10,000 matched
controls will be available). This will allow us to, in collaboration with the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium,
discover genomic loci harboring common variation associated with OCD. Third, we will fine-map genome-wide
significant loci and calculate individual polygenic risk scores (PRS) as a measure of genetic liability to OCD.
We expect the new inclusion of ancestrally diverse samples to improve our fine-mapping ability, to yield more
accurate PRS in non-European samples and ultimately to reduce health disparities when OCD genomic
findings are used clinically. Overall, this study will improve our understanding of the causal mechanisms
implicated in OCD, with a view towards improving clinical outcomes and reducing chronicity and societal costs."
10818531,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
After spinal cord injury (SCI), the injury site is filled with cellular debris, especially myelin debris that creates a
very unique lipid-dense environment. Macrophages are the predominant phagocyte that are responsible for
debris-clearance, but this process is not only inefficient, it is also maladaptive. The excessive amount of myelin
debris present at the injury site leads to formation lipid-laden macrophages (a.k.a. foamy macrophages) that
become pro-inflammatory and contribute to tissue regeneration failure. Therefore, understanding the
mechanisms of foamy macrophage formation after SCI may lead to novel therapeutic targets to promote repair
after SCI. In this application, we will investigate the molecular mechanisms of lipid accumulation in foamy
macrophages and how they contribute to fibrotic scar formation at the spinal cord injury site."
10894839,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Intestinal fluid secretion is a principal function of enterocytes and is mediated by the cystic fibrosis
transmembrane conductance regulator anion channel, CFTR. Stress and CFTR are linked to common
diarrheal diseases such as Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS-D) that affects 20% of the US population. CFTR is
also linked to diarrhea due to genetic, inflammatory, common E. Coli infections, and other etiologies. But how
stress exacerbates or leads to diarrhea is not understood. This proposal examines novel mechanisms that
regulate CFTR in the intestine with the aim of advancing our knowledge of gut fluid secretion and developing
new therapeutics. We have a special interest in identifying new and novel druggable targets to treat diarrheal
diseases stemming from genetic, infectious, and stress-related etiologies. CFTR is regulated by direct
cAMP(PKA) and cGMP(PKG)-dependent phosphorylation and vesicular traffic in enterocytes. This proposal
centers on a key but previously unrecognized role for glucocorticoids (GCs) and serum glucocorticoid kinase 1
(SGK1) in regulating intestinal CFTR and the potential for targeting this pathway to treat diarrhea. SGK1 is
transcriptionally regulated by glucocorticoids (GCs), mineralocorticoids, cell stress, and other factors, and
potently regulates ion transport by transcription, translation, and traffic. However, nothing is known about how
GCs and SGK1 regulate CFTR in the intestine. The hypothesis to be tested here is that GC, SGK1, and kinase
signaling pathways regulate CFTR in the intestine and can exacerbate diarrheal diseases. The hypothesis will
be tested through the following aims: (1) Determine the role of GC and kinase signaling in regulating CFTR
function, mRNA, and protein expression in the intestine. (2) Examine the role of GC and kinases in regulating
CFTR membrane traffic in the intestine. (3) Examine the role of GC-SGK1 pathways in cGMP-elicited diarrheal
diseases. These aims will be achieved by employing two animal models (SGK1 KO, and Nedd4-2KO), cultured
intestinal cells expressing endogenous CFTR, and scientific approaches including Ussing chamber
electrophysiology, in vivo trafficking assays, shRNA silencing, kinase signaling assays, mass spectrometry,
qPCR, immunoblotting and immunofluorescence staining. Collectively, these studies will break new ground
and expand our understanding of mechanisms regulating CFTR in the intestine and potentially identify novel
physiologic targets to treat CFTR-mediated diarrhea stemming from diverse etiologies.

 Restoration of soft tissue is a significant challenge facing clinicians. The available reparative options,
whether prosthetic or autologous, present major drawbacks including donor site defects, unpredictable tissue
survival, limited duration of restoration, prosthetic exposure, infection, and fibrosis. Therefore, a critical need
exists for a solution which can replace missing tissue volume while encouraging natural remodeling of soft tissue
over time. We have recently developed an injectable nanofiber-hydrogel composite (NHC) material which is
capable of inducing remodeling of the injected volume into vascularized soft tissue with adipocytes without
relying on exogenous growth factors and cells. However, the mechanisms by which it does so are not yet well
understood.
 The goal of this proposed project is to characterize the immune and tissue remodeling kinetics of the
injected NHC material, uncover the mechanism(s) by which it achieves soft tissue remodeling, and optimize its
formulation to enhance this desired outcome. We will first investigate the local immune and tissue remodeling
kinetics of the injected site caused by the NHC. This will include characterizing cell infiltration, healthy
extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition vs. irregular fibrosis and foreign body response, inflammation,
angiogenesis, and adipogenesis. In addition, we will uncover the NHC’s mechanism of instigating soft tissue
remodeling by carrying out single-cell RNA sequencing to identify candidate cell subtypes and activated signaling
pathways and then subsequently confirm them through immune knockout or targeted depletion models to
establish a causal relationship. Gaining insight into how soft tissue remodeling can be accomplished with this
biomaterial system will have wide-reaching implications for the regenerative medicine field as we work towards
creating off-the-shelf biomaterials-based solutions for tissue replacement. Finally, through modulation of physical
and structural properties as well as leveraging our mechanistic understanding, we will optimize the parameters
of the NHC to maximize desired soft tissue remodeling. If successful, this proposal will produce an improved off-
the-shelf biostimulatory NHC with enhanced capacity to achieve natural tissue restoration outcomes as well as
a mechanistic understanding of how to achieve soft tissue remodeling, thereby expanding the ability to treat
patients and allowing scientists to engineer the next generation of biomaterials for tissue replacement."

Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is projected to affect 13 million people in the US by 2050 and remains neither
curable nor preventable. Following remarkable recent progress, the genomic architecture of AD and related
dementias (ADRD) is coming into focus. Similar to other common and genetically complex disorders, AD is
characterized by substantial locus heterogeneity and polygenic susceptibility: risk or protective alleles are
being identified in many distinct genes, and in most individuals, a subset of common and rare variants likely
interact to trigger neurodegeneration. The critical next steps include confirmation of the responsible genes,
understanding the functional impact of disease-associated variants, elaboration of the relevant cell types and
pathways, and determining how polygenic interactions mediate disease risk. We propose an integrated
computational and tiered experimental validation strategy to accelerate AD functional genomics, building on
advances from the AD Sequencing Project (ADSP) and leveraging powerful technologies available in the fruit
fly, Drosophila melanogaster. First (AIM 1), leveraging infrastructure developed for the Clinical Genome
Resource and ENCODE projects, we will integrate ADSP results with other human data, including brain
transcriptome and epigenome profiles, prioritizing genes and variants for experimental follow-up. Next (AIM 2),
using high-throughput Drosophila screening, we will systematically manipulate 2,000 conserved, candidate AD
genes in vivo to pinpoint causal modulators of age-dependent neurodegeneration, including interactions with
Tau, Aß, and other pathologic triggers. Third (AIM 3), for a subset of 200 prioritized gene candidates, we will
generate customized Drosophila strains and characterize cell-type expression and loss-of-function phenotypes.
Lastly (AIM 4), for 50 high-priority targets, we will experimentally probe mechanisms in-depth, including testing
of cell-type specific requirements (neurons vs. glia) and examining gene-gene interactions that define relevant
pathways. We will broadly share all project data and resources with the research community (AIM 5). Our
integrative, tiered, cross-species strategy promises rapid functional annotation of ADSP targets using powerful,
in vivo assays in the aging nervous system of Drosophila, and is ideally suited for reciprocal cross-validation in
complementary mammalian preclinical models. On a scale and timeframe not currently possible in other model
systems, our innovative experimental strategy will transcend barriers to translation of human genetic
discoveries and catalyze breakthroughs in our understanding AD pathobiology."
10851822,"Hemophilia A (HA) is an X-linked bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency in factor VIII (FVIII) due to mutations
in the F8 gene. The disease affects 1:5,000 male born worldwide. Replacement therapy with FVIII protein is
effective in preventing/controlling bleeding but ~30% of patients develop inhibitors to FVIII (neutralizing
alloantibodies) that renders FVIII ineffective; thus, increasing morbidity and mortality. Immune tolerance
induction (ITI) is the only successful strategy for eradication of inhibitors/restore immune tolerance to FVIII. ITI
regimens are based on FVIII protein injections for months/years and is efficacious in ~60% of cases, but the high
cost (~1million/year) prevents its use outside the developed word. Thus, new approaches for inhibitor eradication
are urgently needed. Ongoing AAV liver gene therapy clinical trials for HA without inhibitors resulted in
therapeutic FVIII. These studies are using vectors manufactured in either HEK-293 or Sf9 cells that differ in their
basic biology and clinical outcomes. Our central hypothesis is that AAV-FVIII liver gene therapy is an ideal
ITI regimen based on our proof-of-concept report in inhibitor HA dogs (Finn et al Blood, 2010) and novel
preliminary data. We will use 2 novel distinct high-responding inhibitor HA dog models with the canine F8 gene
mutations associated with the most challenging inhibitor patient group that likely would benefit from AAV ITI. The
rationale of this proposal is that a single injection of AAV liver gene therapy provides (A) efficient eradication of
high titer inhibitors, (B) restoration and maintenance of immune tolerance to FVIII in high responding HA dogs
and (C) continuous FVIII expression that improves the bleeding phenotype after inhibitor eradication. The
specific aims are Aim 1: Determine the efficacy of AAV gene therapy in inducing immune tolerance in
high-responding HA dog models.We will advance our efforts testing AAV gene therapy in dog models across
several distinct breeds to define the factors associated with kinetics of inhibitor eradication (transgene
levels/duration). Aim 2: Determine the potential of ITI by rAAV-Sf9-derived AAV-cFVIII gene therapy in
high-responding HA dog models. Recent unexpected decline of FVIII expression after 3 years post- AAV-Sf9-
FVIII in HA patients raised concerns of durability. To date, the underlying mechanism is unknown. We
hypothesized that this could be a combination of Sf9-derived vector and/or FVIII. We will determine in dogs if
AAV-Sf9 impacts FVIII expression levels over time and its ability to eradicate inhibitors and to induce tolerance
to FVIII. Aim 3: Define the mechanism(s) underlying AAV-mediated ITI. In these novel dog models, we will
characterize specific B cells and especially T regulatory cells pool and function following AAV-ITI and to
determine the underlying mechanism of immune tolerance in both cell line-derived vector systems. Successful
completion of this proposal would support AAV liver gene therapy clinical trial for inhibitor HA patients. The ability
of gene therapy to induce immune tolerance is likely to be relevant to other genetic diseases treated with enzyme
replacement therapy and complicated by antidrug neutralizing antibodies."

HIV-1 persistence in ART is maintained predominantly by tissue reservoirs. However, due to challenges in
sampling anatomic sites, particularly in living subjects, most of the information on viral reservoir composition and
dynamics has been gleaned from studies with circulating CD4+ T cells. As a result, the contribution of tissue
resident macrophages to viral persistence, remains elusive. Therefore, there is a need for new approaches that
can reveal the composition and dynamics of anatomic reservoirs in living subjects.
In the previous funding period, we developed new methods capable of interrogating myeloid cell reservoirs in
living subjects. One approach, termed liganded virion immunocapture, gauges the origins of virions in plasma
from their proteomic content. It exploits the fact that the virion membrane is derived from the plasma membrane
and that virions in plasma will therefore contain tags that reflect their host cell origin. With this approach, we
provided evidence that some virions in plasma of individuals undergoing analytic treatment interruption (ATI) had
a myeloid cell origin [1]. In this renewal, we propose to identify some anatomic sources of the myeloid reservoir,
as well as the longevity and dynamics of the myeloid reservoir. Our objectives are to:
Aim 1: Examine the composition of post-ATI viremia to assess the presence of infected myeloid cells,
including CNS microglia, under suppressive ART.
1a: Track the relative frequencies of myeloid-cell-originating virions (liganded virion immunocapture and
macrophage fusogenicity, molecular clock) across an ATI interval to gain insight into the kinetics of myeloid
reservoir reactivation.
1b: Use liganded immunocapture with microglia-specific tags to assess whether microglial-cell-originating virions
populate post-ATI viremia.
Aim 2: Establish the chronicity of the myeloid reservoir, timing of its establishment and its role in evasion
of host cell immunity.
2a: Track the re-emergence of related, myeloid-originating viral variants across sequential ATIs conducted over
a two year period.
2b: Assess T cell epitope escape frequencies in temporally matched (molecular clock), myeloid-derived and
lymphoid-derived virus populations.
2c: Evaluate whether myeloid cell-derived virions populate post-ATI viremia in early ART subjects.
This proposal leverages important and unique clinical cohorts assembled from subjects undergoing single and
sequential ATIs as well acute infection subjects and employs novel methods of examining post-ATI viremia to
gain insight into anatomic myeloid reservoirs that have thus far, remained elusive."
10916225,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Humans have a uniquely developed ability to impose internal goals on how they interact with their environment.
Referred to as “cognitive control”, this capacity includes two core components: (1) the ability to focus attention on
currently goal-relevant stimulus features and responses (a “task set”) while ignoring task-irrelevant features (cognitive
stability); and (2) the ability to switch to a different task set when circumstances change (cognitive flexibility). Crucially,
to thrive in a dynamic environment, we need to continuously adapt our levels of cognitive stability and flexibility to suit
changing demands. E.g., when cooking a meal, needs for stability (e.g., a strong task-focus when slicing onion) and
flexibility (e.g., rapid shifting between recipe reading and stovetop monitoring) change frequently over time. The
strategic regulation of stability and flexibility is thus fundamental for success in everyday life, and is in fact severely
impaired in many clinical conditions. However, the underlying neurocognitive mechanisms are poorly understood. This is
due to the fact that, while there are large literatures on cognitive stability (in the shape of conflict-control studies) and
flexibility (in the shape of task-switching studies), these processes have been either investigated in isolation, conflated,
or not interrogated in terms of their dynamic adaptation. The present proposal seeks to overcome these barriers to
progress by combining a novel task protocol that assesses simultaneous and independent adaptive shifts in stability and
flexibility with computational modeling, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and intracranial electro-
encephalography (iEEG). Our overall goal is to characterize the neurocognitive mechanisms of concurrent, strategic
control over cognitive stability and flexibility. We triangulate this goal via three aims: Aim 1 seeks to establish the first
computational model of concurrent stability and flexibility regulation by fitting and simulating behavioral data from
protocols with time-varying demands on stability and flexibility (Studies 1 and 2). Our working model consists of two
independent reinforcement learners making trial-by-trial predictions about forthcoming demands on stability (conflict-
likelihood) and flexibility (switch-likelihood), which in turn modulate distinct within-trial drift-diffusion model
parameters. Aim 2 employs the winning model to determine the neural mechanisms mediating these adjustments in
stability and flexibility. Building on a large prior literature, we use complementary fMRI (Study 3) and iEEG (Study 4)
approaches to test specific neuroanatomical hypotheses about the respective roles of the lateral prefrontal, posterior
parietal, and anterior cingulate cortex, as well as the basal ganglia, in supporting the proactive adaptation of stability
and flexibility to time-varying demands. Finally, Aim 3 will use fMRI to characterize the neural reinstatement of context-
appropriate stability and flexibility settings when they are applied reactively, i.e., in response to specific demand-
predicting stimuli (Study 5). Together, these complementary aims represent the first systematic investigation into the
computational and neural mechanisms underlying the concurrent regulation of cognitive stability and flexibility. This
innovative project will significantly advance our understanding of the neurocomputational bases of cognitive control,
and lay the groundwork for identifying potential failure modes of stability and flexibility regulation in clinical conditions."

Mustard vesicating agent sulfur mustard (SM) is the most extensively used warfare agent in history and remains
a potential agent of warfare and terrorism. Eye is the most sensitive organ to SM and its analog nitrogen mustard
(NM) exposure, resulting in devastating biphasic injury called Mustard Gas Keratopathy. The dose- and time-
related severity of symptoms and the mechanism of this biphasic injury involving damage to the most affected
cornea and possibly to other ocular tissues is not well understood. In addition, the extent to which mustard
vesicants distribute, transport, and persist in various tissues of the eye is largely unknown, which could further
identify tissue specific toxicity effects, injury progression and repair process. Such studies could aid in the
identification of effective treatment strategies to counter tissue specific acute and long-term ocular complications
from mustard vesicants’ exposure, which are elusive. To address this knowledge gap, we will use a synergistic
in vivo-in silico approach to determine mustard vesicant ocular distribution and the ensuing corneal injury and
repair mechanisms. We will leverage CFD Research’s existing in silico rabbit ocular model that is currently being
used to characterize the distribution related toxicity of various chemical threat agents. Using the published data,
preliminary in silico modeling studies show that NM penetrates well beyond the cornea. We hypothesize that a
synergistic novel in vivo-in silico approach will assist in understanding how mustard vesicants distribute in healthy
eyes and the mechanism by which the ocular injury develops, persists, and recovers or reappears as long-term
complications. To support this hypothesis, the proposed specific aims will first computationally model NM (SM
surrogate used in laboratory settings) related ocular injury and then translate this to simulate SM exposure. Aim
1: Determine Ocular Distribution of Nitrogen Mustard for Various Exposure Scenarios. The computational
model will be validated on NM toxicokinetic (TK) profiles from in vivo rabbit studies and then extrapolated within
the experimentally tested range to obtain TK profiles for non-tested NM exposure scenarios. Aim 2: Identify
Relevant Biomarkers, Mechanisms and Pathways of NM-Induced Corneal Injury Progression and Repair.
The combination of time- and dose-dependent transcriptomics and biomarker evaluation, as well as the NM TK
analysis proposed under Aim 1, may contribute to determine the pathological mechanisms underlying early and
late corneal injury development, progression, and repair related to vesicant bi-phasic keratopathy. Aim 3:
Translation of the In Silico NM Rabbit Ocular Model to Simulate SM Exposure. The preliminary evaluations
could assess comparisons of in Silico SM corneal injury model with NM, and serve as a vital step for minor
alterations or in designing animal studies for additional validation under future studies. A combination of in silico
and in vivo studies could serve as a more efficient and potentially more insightful novel approach to evaluate
tissue-specific toxicity mechanisms underlying the mustard vesicants’ ocular pathology, and to identify
therapeutic strategies that can improve the clinical mustard keratopathy symptoms and enhance wound healing."

 With treatment advances for childhood cancer, over 80% of patients achieve long-term survival. However,
cancer treatments often lead to other serious issues, including chronic health problems and early mortality.
These health problems are referred to as “late effects,” defined as any adverse medical or psychosocial
outcome that develops or persists after treatment. By 25 years following treatment, over two-thirds of childhood
cancer survivors (CSS) have developed at least one clinically significant late effect, with over one-third
developing one or more severe or life-threatening late effect. As a result, life-long cancer-focused long-term
follow-up care (LTFU) is essential for CCS to screen for, prevent, and treat late effects. Our current
understanding of among CCS comes primarily from a cohort of adult CCS diagnosed between 1970 and 1986
(The Childhood Cancer Survivor Study-CCSS) which is comprised of predominantly non-Hispanic white
survivors. However, studies have shown that CCS from racial and ethnic minority backgrounds experience
significant health disparities and thus more research is required among CCS of diverse backgrounds to
understand disparities to address and reverse them. Rates of LTFU and factors influencing cancer-focused
care among Asian American (AA) CCS are unknown. AA populations represent the fastest growing ethnic
group in the United States and the largest group of new immigrants, with 59% of the US Asian population born
in another country. This group is culturally and socioeconomically heterogenous and has grown 72% between
2000 and 2015 is projected to grow to more than 10% of the US population by 2050. Thus, the number of AA
CCS is expected to increase, and a greater focus on facilitators and barriers to LTFU is needed in this
underresearched population. Further, many Asian immigrants live in ethnically concentrated neighborhoods
(ethnic enclaves) which may influence engagement in LTFU for AA CCS. We propose to recruit a population-
based cohort of roughly 330 young adult AA CCS and their parents (N=100) in Los Angeles and Orange
Counties to examine factors related to survivorship care utilization. Our aims are: Aim 1: We will characterize
on a population basis the utilization of cancer-focused survivorship care among Asian CCS. Aim 2: We will
examine through qualitative interviews and survey methods individual- and family-level factors associated with
the utilization of cancer-focused survivorship care among AA CCS and their parents. Aim 3: We will investigate
the effect of residing in an ethnically concentrated neighborhood on the utilization of LTFU. The proposed
research will provide guidance to identify and address needs among AA CCS for survivorship care utilization to
increase culturally congruent outreach and intervention strategies to engage and retain these CCS in care."

Bladder cancer is the second most common genitourinary malignancy in the US with approximately
80,000 new cases and 17,700 deaths each year. It is a heterogeneous set of diseases that range from
locally treatable superficial tumors that are generally not life-threatening but require chronic management,
to advanced disease that requires multimodal invasive treatments and has higher risk of distal metastasis
and death. It is the ninth most expensive cancer overall in the US, and, per diagnosed patient, the most
expensive cancer to manage. Risk factors for bladder cancer broadly include chemical and environmental
exposures such as cigarette smoking and chemical carcinogens that are ingested or found in the
workplace, as well as genetic abnormalities and chronic bladder irritation. Outcomes for bladder cancer
have remained relatively stable in the last two decades. However, opportunities abound to improve the
prevention, detection, and management of bladder cancer. The advent of novel biomarkers, and novel
treatments, including immunotherapies (checkpoint inhibitors), gene therapies, and antibody-drug
conjugates may have a large impact in coming years. Bladder cancer is amenable to population modeling
because it has high morbidity, mortality, and cost, is likely preventable by minimizing smoking and toxin
exposure, and the emergence of novel promising biomarkers and treatments. The long-term goal of our
research program is to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of population- and person-level
approaches to bladder cancer prevention, detection, and management given current knowledge and
constraints. The overall objective of the current proposal is to address major questions in the surveillance,
treatment, prevention, and diagnosis of bladder cancer by means of comparative mathematical modeling.
We will address six specific aims: We will (1) complete the development, calibration, and validation of
two independent population models of bladder cancer; (2) explain secular trends in bladder cancer
incidence in relation to trends in tobacco use in key population subgroups and estimate the impact of the
1964 Surgeon General’s smoking recommendations; (3) assess the effectiveness of smoking cessation,

10915593,"ABSTRACT. The broad, long-term objectives of this K01 project are to improve the health of Apache American
Indians through a study that examines the association between cancer (CA) outcomes and Arsenic (As), co-
metals, and nitrate on the San Carlos Apache (SCA) reservation in Arizona. The study setting has an extensive
history of hard rock mining since the early 1900s when uranium (U), copper, silver, and asbestos were
extracted. Anthropogenic causes and naturally occurring elements can cause movement of As and co-metals
into the environment and may result in adverse health effects. Arsenic is a known carcinogen and is associated
with diabetes, adverse reproductive outcomes, and cardiovascular disease. A main goal of this pilot study is to
develop and implement an exposure assessment tool (EAT) to study cancers and to use in the future to
examine the association between exposures and multiple adverse health outcomes. The specific aims are to:
1) characterize historical water data by time and recorded As, Cd, Pb, U, and nitrate concentration levels from
1981-2021, 2) examine the association between chronically elevated As, Cd, Pb, U, and nitrate in water and
CA outcomes (bladder, kidney, prostate, lung, breast, and skin), 3) analyze and apply a Geographic
Information System (GIS) model to map high-risk (As, Cd, Pb, U, nitrate) areas based on this EAT, and 4)
provide study findings to tribal members and leaders. A retrospective pair matched case-control (N = 160)
design will be employed. Decades of As, Cd, Pb, U, and nitrates concentration levels recorded by the US
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), tribal EPA, and US Geological Survey from areas known to have
elevated As, co-metal and nitrate concentration levels will be collected. Local tribal health/Indian Health
Service (IHS) records will be examined for CA diagnoses and mortality (using ICD codes) reported by the IHS,
tribal health, private health records, state CA registries, and mortality records of the past 10 years. Study
controls will be selected from SCA enrollment data and matched to cases by sex and age. Odds Ratios will be
reported using logistic regression to determine associations between exposure risk and outcomes. A dose
response between chronic As, Cd, Pb, U, and nitrate water ingestion and reported cancers are anticipated.
This is the first local study to retrospectively examine water contaminant levels in relation to multiple CA
outcomes. The data will form the foundation for an R01 intervention study to educate, screen, and identify risks
for adverse health outcomes among residents. Findings will be disseminated to tribal members and leaders,
healthcare facilities, and the general population. This study has the potential to augment prevention efforts,
intervention, education, monitoring/surveillance, and can support policy development and legislation. The
project will reach a nationally underserved population in the biomedical, social, behavioral, and clinical
sciences and is in alignment with training diverse scientists in fields per the NCI grant purpose and mission.
The study addresses CA disparities in an underserved community while advancing scientific knowledge."
10906280,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 This T32 program in Investigative Rheumatology, currently in its 44th year, is dedicated to the
foremost research training of biomedical scientists to prepare future leaders for the investigation of
rheumatologic and immunologic diseases. The program continues with its core philosophy that advanced
training in the fundamental methodologies of laboratory and translational research is essential for
elucidating pathogenic mechanisms, and for devising more effective therapeutic and preventative
strategies. The program will recruit the most highly qualified candidates from among clinical and post-
graduate fellows with prior research achievement (MD, PhD, and MD/PhD). Training is interdisciplinary,
enriched by specialized post-graduate coursework, and led by 30 faculty from the School of Medicine who
are both distinguished in their respective fields of investigation and have an excellent track record of
mentorship. The unique features of this program originate from: a) An emphasis on molecular mechanisms
of human disease and state-of-the-art methodologies, including high-sensitivity and high-throughput
profiling technologies, genomics, microbiome research, bioinformatics, and genetically-based disease
modeling; b) An accomplished training faculty and existing collaborative interactions between the basic and
clinical scientists; and c) A focused mission to create a scientifically-minded cadre of physician-scientists
able to engage the challenges of rheumatologic diseases with incisive hypotheses and state-of-the-art
experimental approaches. The program will build on existing investigative programs in autoimmunity,
inflammation, and clinical immunology, and incorporate recent research initiatives. Four trainees (MD and
PhD) per year are currently supported and the same number is requested in this renewal application. MD
trainees typically perform clinical work in the first year of their fellowship and then enter research training
under T32 support; some additionally enroll in a Masters or PhD degree-granting program. Research
training is typically for 2-3 years, with subsequent training years supported by individual fellowship grants
or career development awards. The inclusion in this program of both MD and PhD fellows provides a rich
training experience, and fellows receive didactic and interactive instruction in biology, research
methodologies, and career and ethical guidance in conducting research. This program provides trainees
with a foundation in advanced research to better enable them to bridge experimental investigation with
clinical information, and thus improve understanding in rheumatologic diseases. Success is measured by
our accruing pool of graduates who initiate investigative careers, develop into accomplished physician-
scientists, and achieve leadership positions in academic medicine."
10907728,"ABSTRACT – BIOSPECIMEN/PATHOLOGY CORE
The overarching goal of this SPORE is to understand the biological underpinnings of hyperactivated p21ras
pathway signals in the pathogenesis of childhood malignancies of neurofibromatosis type 1 and to bring new
therapies to the clinic. Each project explores this theme using a different disease model. However, all projects
interweave human, mouse and in vitro studies to identify factors that modify the effects of Ras. To ensure the
success of these studies, complementary cutting-edge technologies will be used to address key questions
related to disease susceptibility, likelihood of disease relapse, and risk for other malignancies.
The Biospecimen and Pathology Core will receive human and mouse samples from all four projects in the
SPORE. The core will also provide pathological review of all samples and will make these data available to all
SPORE investigators and the broader research community. The specific aims of this core are:
Aim 1: Maintain and update the DHART SPORE website as an effective internal and external
communication tool.
Aim 2: Utilize uniform biospecimen receipt, tracking and distribution procedures for samples collected as part
of DHART SPORE projects.
Aim 3: Apply uniform pathology protocols for the characterization of human and animal samples
collected as part of DHART SPORE projects."
10862628,"Overview: I am reapplying for a 5-year Career Development Award (CDA) to support my overarching goal of
studying how imaging tools can improving care of heart failure (HF) patients who require device therapy. This
will be accomplished through the completion of mentored research activities and formal training designed to
provide the skills necessary to become an independent investigator. During the course of my award, I will study
an innovative method of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) in patients with HF who have not had an
improvement in cardiac function with the standard treatment of care. I also plan to establish the feasibility of
cardiac MRI to assess cardiac function over time in patients with heart failure treated with device therapy.
Significance: HF is one of the most common conditions cared for by the Veterans Health Administration and
has a 15% annual mortality rate in VA patients. Approximately 50% of the hospitalizations for HF occur in
patients with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). In these patients, a primary treatment goal includes strategies
to increase the cardiac fraction, which has been shown to improve symptoms and decrease the risk of sudden
cardiac death. In patients who also have a left bundle branch block, the main therapy has involved placing
cardiac pacing leads in the right ventricle and in a cardiac vein overlying the left ventricle, referred to as CRT.
However, up to 40% patients who undergo CRT fail to experience the expected improvement in cardiac
function and symptoms after 6 months and are referred to as “non-responders.” This study aims to improve
cardiac function in “non-responders” by pacing the heart from the left bundle branch area, thereby utilizing the
heart’s intrinsic electrical system to promote coordinated ventricular contractions. The intervention developed
in this CDA proposal has the potential for wide-reaching impact as it could significantly decrease the morbidity
and mortality of HFrEF patients and reduce costs and burdens placed on the VA health care system.
Career Plan: My primary area of research has focused on improving outcomes for patients with heart failure.
To successfully achieve my goals of improving care for heart failure patients that require device therapy, I need
further mentored training in implementation science including: quantitative and mixed methods training,
expertise in diagnostic imaging training and research (particularly cardiac MRI), further biostatistics training,
and cultivating multidisciplinary collaboration and networking skills. I will achieve these objectives through
formal coursework, seminars, and mentored research activities under the guidance of primary mentors Selçuk
Adabag, MD, MS (MVAHCS) and Chetan Shenoy, MBBS, MS (University of Minnesota Department of
Cardiology), and secondary mentors Bradley Bart, MD (MVAHCS) and Sue Duval (University of Minnesota
Department of Cardiology). The mentored research training through this grant will lay the groundwork for my
long-term goal of becoming a recognized leader and researcher focused on the use of cardiac imaging to
improve patient centered and clinical outcomes for patients with heart failure who require device therapy.
Research Plan: My primary research objective is to assess a novel method of CRT in patient with HFrEF and
LBBB, who have failed to respond to traditional CRT therapy. To execute this goal, I will complete the
following: 1) a prospective, randomized-controlled study assessing the effectiveness of left bundle branch area
pacing (LBBAP) vs continued CRT (the current gold standard) in improving cardiac function and patient
symptoms, 2) assess the accuracy and feasibility of cardiac MRI in measuring cardiac function in patients with
device therapy. The proposed training and research will generate preliminary data necessary for development
of a future Merit award proposal to be submitted in Year 4. I plan to propose a prospective, multicenter,
randomized controlled trial of the intervention evaluated in this study, which will launch my career as an
independent VA CSR&D investigator committed to improving Veterans’ cardiac health though improved
diagnostic and therapeutic treatment options."
10709526,"This application to the Rehabilitation Research and Development Service includes a research plan to
comprehensively investigate the condition of peripheral vestibular hypofunction, how it manifests in vestibular-
related behaviors, and whether it is associated with the induction of synaptopathy in vestibular hair cells.
Enhanced knowledge of vestibular hypofunction is critically important for two primary reasons. First, it appears
to exhibit broad penetrance among US service personnel and veterans, largely because vestibular hypofunction
may be associated with traumatic brain injury. And second, there is strong evidence that many forms of
vestibular hypofunction may be associated with synaptopathies, for which rehabilitation strategies may be
particularly effective for treatment. Therefore, in view of the heightened risk factors to which US service
personnel may be exposed, research into diagnosis and treatment of vestibular hypofunction and the association
with synaptopathies has the potential for broad impact on the lives of our Veterans.
 While investigations into cochlear hypofunction have provided a wealth of valuable information regarding
their etiology, diagnosis, and treatment, information regarding vestibular hypofunction is in a nascent state. A
recent investigation of aging mice has demonstrated that synaptopathies are a component of age-related
vestibular hypofunction, thereby demonstrating that synaptopathies impact all inner ear sensory epithelia.
Cochlear hypofunction and synaptopathies are also induced by mild aminoglycoside treatment, resulting in
similar signature dysfunction as demonstrated for synaptopathies induced by mild acoustic trauma. The
proposed research plan endeavors to comprehensively investigate vestibular hypofunction induced by low-dose
gentamicin in a well-established animal model of normal vestibular function, implementing direct
intraperilymphatic administration to precisely control the dose delivered to the labyrinth. Preliminary data
demonstrated that vestibular hypofunction results from conditions that leave the vestibular sensory epithelia
morphologically intact, a condition that parallels the findings in cochlear synaptopathy. The hypofunction is
represented by attenuated coherence between stimulus and response in the discharge of afferent neurons,
indicating compromise to signal-to-noise ratios and information transmission along vestibular afferent pathways.
With this evidence, we proposed four hypotheses and associated Aims. In Aim I we will establish the direct
association of vestibular hypofunction with changes in synapse density, under conditions of gentamicin
administration for which we have functional evidence of potential synaptopathy from metrics derived from single
neuron electrophysiology. Direct measures of synapse densities, assessed through quantitative
immunohistochemistry, will be directly correlated with afferent physiology by intracellular labeling of
physiologically characterized afferent neurons. The research under Aim II is directed toward the development
of dynamic head stabilometry, a behavioral test of that we propose provides a window into the form of
hypofunction we observe in afferent neuron recordings. We submit that this behavior test requires integration of
multimodal CNS circuits that are affected by the increase in sensory uncertainty concomitant with conditions of
synaptopathy. Through Aim III we will elucidate the dose-dependent outcomes of graded hypofunction, and
establish the temporal course of synaptopathy development. Aim IV is directed toward testing the efficacy of
using dynamic stabilometry as a training tool to improve head stabilization function and potentially provide
synaptic rehabilitation. In summary, this study represents a comprehensive effort to ameliorate conditions that
are likely to impact a large number of Veterans, and lay the groundwork for future therapies restoring synaptic
efficacy and the conditions that compromise the activity of Veterans and the US population."
10709547,"Cardiometabolic disease (e.g., type 2 diabetes or cardiovascular disease) is a leading cause of disability and
mortality in the United States, and especially so among Veterans. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) – a
salient health concern for many Veterans and their families – is linked to an increased risk of cardiometabolic
disease and premature mortality. The precise mechanisms of this relationship are not fully understood.
However, recent research suggests that a diagnosis of PTSD increases the risk for hypertension, dyslipidemia
and obesity, all of which are known predictors of cardiometabolic disease. A better understanding of what
modifiable factors (e.g., lifestyle) influence the link between PTSD and cardiometabolic health and functioning
will aid in the development of novel rehabilitative nonpharmacological interventions (e.g., exercise) for
cardiometabolic disease and disability in Veterans with PTSD. Physical activity (PA) and diet are promising
examples of modifiable lifestyle factors. For instance, regular PA and a healthy diet strongly reduce the risk for
cardiometabolic disease through numerous pathways, such as reductions in blood pressure, blood lipids,
adiposity, and by promoting blood glucose control. Simply put, 80% of all new cases of type 2 diabetes are
attributed to physical inactivity and poor diet. Low cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is also a critical factor in the
risk for disability and mortality due to cardiovascular disease. Despite the clear value and potential impact,
there is little research examining relationships between PA and diet, cardiometabolic health, and functioning in
Veterans with PTSD. This is a critical research gap. Physical inactivity and poor diet increase the risk of
cardiometabolic disease and PTSD likely compounds this risk. Veterans with PTSD often lead sedentary lives
and make unhealthy dietary choices placing them in a perfect storm for developing cardiometabolic disease
and related disability. The purpose of this project is to examine the influence of several modifiable yet
understudied lifestyle factors (i.e., PA and diet quality) on indicators of cardiometabolic health, and functioning
in post-9/11 Veterans. The aims of this project are: Aim 1: To examine PA participation as a mechanism
linking PTSD to cardiometabolic health and functioning in post-9/11 Veterans. I will longitudinally assess
associations between PTSD diagnosis, PA, cardiometabolic health, and functioning over time in 250 TRACTS
participants. H1-1: Total self-report PA will mediate the effects of PTSD on cardiometabolic health and
functioning over time, such that lower PA will increase the detrimental effect of PTSD on cardiometabolic
health and functioning. H1-2: PA intensity will moderate the effect physical activity has on cardiometabolic
health and functioning. Supplemental Aim 1A: To validate the use of a self-report clinical measure of PA
against objective measure obtained via accelerometry. Objective measurement of PA is not often
accessible or feasible for VA providers (e.g., time constraints). It is essential that quick self-report PA
measures accurately reflect the PA of Veterans. I will compare data from a self-report clinical PA measure to
objectively measured PA/sedentary time (i.e., accelerometry), CRF, cardiometabolic health, functioning, and
PTSD symptom severity in 100 post-9/11 Veterans. H1A-1: Self-report and objective measurement of PA will
be significantly correlated. H1A-2: Both self-report and objectively measured PA/sedentary time will be
associated with CRF, cardiometabolic health, functioning, and PTSD symptom severity.
Aim 2: To examine diet quality as a mechanism linking PTSD to cardiometabolic health and functioning
in post-9/11 Veterans. I will longitudinally assess associations between PTSD diagnosis, diet quality,
cardiometabolic health, and functioning over time in 200 TRACTS participants. H2: Self-report dietary intake
will mediate the effects of PTSD on cardiometabolic health and functioning over time, such that a poor diet will
increase the detrimental effect of PTSD on cardiometabolic health and functioning."
10902091,"Abstract
Genetic diagnosis of complex disease is an important challenge in modern medicine. As a majority of GWAS
hits implicate noncoding regions of the human genome, regulatory elements such as enhancers have become a
major focus in the search for causal mechanisms. This proposal focuses on the development of computational
methods for analyzing experimental data relevant to gene regulatory mechanisms and the variants that can
perturb them, leading to disease. My lab is well positioned to have a sizeable impact on the experimental science
in gene regulation ongoing at Duke and elsewhere, via existing collaborations and memberships in multiple
consortia. In particular, my lab has been developing statistical models for detecting allele-specific gene
expression in individuals and trios, to identify genes that may be under dysregulation. My lab also continues to
develop methods for analyzing genetic variant data from massively parallel reporter assays, which was a focus
of my Ph.D. thesis. And my lab has begun developing statistical methods for analyzing CRISPRi perturbations
in single-cell data to identify gene-enhancer relationships. We expect these synergistic projects to result in more
effective identification of causal variants and a higher diagnosis rate for currently undiagnosed patients of a wide
variety of diseases, as well as potential leads toward the design of therapeutics."
10709714,"ABSTRACT
Over 400 different gene defects have now been identified in association with primary immunodeficiency
diseases. Each of these is a rare disease. The limited number of patients has hindered the development of
clinically validated therapeutics in this group of disorders. In some cases, therapeutics that target specific
immune pathways have been developed for other indications and may have clinical utility in patients with
molecular defects in those immune pathways. Because of limited patient numbers, few clinical trials have been
performed to test novel therapies in this patient population. As a result, most targeted therapies are used “off-
label” by clinical immunologists with little concrete data supporting either efficacy or safety. A critical need
therefore exists for a mechanism to more efficiently and inexpensively perform clinical trials for rare diseases.
The objective of this application is to use a phase I/II basket clinical trial approach to study one drug, Itacitinib,
to treat four rare immune disorders caused by defects in different but related molecular pathways involving
Janus Kinases (JAK) or Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STAT). In each case,
heterozygous genetic defects cause dominant activating, “gain-of-function (GOF)” mutations that lead to early-
onset autoimmunity and immune dysregulation. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the four disorders (STAT1-
GOF, STAT3-GOF, STAT5b-GOF and JAK1-GOF) may all respond to JAK-inhibitors like Itacitinib. To meet the
objectives of this study, we propose the following specific aims: 1) Define key clinical and biologic endpoints
that can be used to assess therapeutic response and toxicity in preparation for IND submission for a basket
clinical trial, 2) Operationalize a clinica trial and obtain IND for use of Itacitinib to treat 4 different JAK/STAT-
GOF disorders in a Phase I/II basket clinical trial, 3) Evaluate the safety and efficacy of Itacitanib for the
treatment of JAK/STAT-GOF disorders, and 4) Determine whether Itacitinib corrects the underlying defects in
immune phenotype of JAK/STAT-GOF patients. The proposed work is innovative because of the basket
clinical trial approach to rare disease therapeutic trials and the use of deep immune profiling to increase the
number of molecular signatures that can be paired with clinical assessments to judge efficacy of the therapy
across the 4 diseases. It is significant for two reasons; It will provide key safety and efficacy data to inform the
use of JAK inhibitor therapy in JAK/STAT-GOF disorders and more importantly, may provide a new model for
clinical studies in the rare disease space that could interest more pharmaceutical companies to explore use of
new therapies in these patients. The information gained is anticipated to decrease the barriers to studying
targeted precision therapies in rare disease. The proposed research is therefore highly relevant to the mission
of the NIH, the purpose of the RFA, and ultimately to the care of patients with rare and understudied diseases."
10911081,"Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a highly prevalent and chronic psychiatric disorder in Veterans
and the broader US population. It is often associated with significant stigma, diminished psychosocial
functioning, poor physical health, and lessened quality of life. Despite the impact of PTSD, a precise
diagnosis is often difficult. PTSD presents as a multi-faceted illness with variable clinical presentation. It
is highly comorbid with other psychiatric disorders, and Veterans and patients often express a myriad of
distinct symptoms. A better neurobiological and network-level understanding of PTSD can lead to
diagnostic clarity and more advanced, targeted, and individualized treatments. Despite this, the
biological mechanisms of PTSD are not fully understood. Also, finding a unitary biomarker of PTSD has
proven difficult. This is likely because of the diversity of presentation, and the potential that different
biological subtypes exist within the clinical symptom profile.
Recently, advanced computational tools have emerged that can parse this high level of complexity and
thus hold significant promise to develop individualized and neurobiologically-based and objective
biomarkers of PTSD. The primary research objective of this CDA-2 is to develop an objective brain-
based identification that can be used to individualize diagnosis and treatment for Veterans suffering
from PTSD. The first specific aim will evaluate whether a machine learning algorithm can link PTSD
symptoms with the information in individuals’ neuroimaging data. The second specific aim will test
whether a machine learning algorithm can be used to link brain networks to DSM-5 PTSD symptom
clusters in order to enable mapping of network abnormalities to commonly recognized DSM-5 domains
of PTSD. The candidate’s exploratory research objective will investigate the relationship between
individual PTSD symptoms and connectivity-based networks to determine if symptoms can be grouped
differently to make a modified and data-driven PTSD diagnostic tool.
The findings from this study will provide foundational data for future Merit-funded work and lay the
foundation for a programmatic, independent VA career bringing data science to research and clinical
care. The protected time funded by this CDA award will allow the candidate to participate in activities
imparting a unique combination of skills and perspectives that will allow him to bridge basic and clinical
science in the service of finding better treatment options for Veterans with PTSD. This CDA-2 will allow
for the time to gain the critical skills needed to integrate neuroimaging, machine learning, and advanced
analytic methods. The candidate is well-established within the VA system and currently holds a staff
physician (psychiatrist) position. He is also actively involved in clinical research with a successful track
record of conducting clinical and translational studies. The candidate’s mentorship team is comprised of
VA clinicians and scientists actively working with veterans, specifically those with PTSD. They also
have expertise in data science, computational psychiatry, and advanced analytics. They are well-
qualified to mentor the candidate toward the career goal of becoming an independent VA based
physician-scientist with an active research program, leveraging data science tools to understand mental
illness neurobiology better and develop new and individualized treatments."
10919789,"Chronic multi-symptom illnesses (CMI) are complex and poorly understood diseases principally
characterized by fatigue, pain, and problems with cognitive function. For Veterans, these diseases are
collectively referred to as Gulf War Illnesses (GWI) and affect ~250,000 Gulf War Veterans (GVs) (25-35% of
the 1991 GV population). Nearly 50% of GVs seek VA clinical care, and nearly 40% receive disability
compensation. To date, the causes of these symptoms are not known, and as a result, no efficacious
treatments are available. Moreover, recent evidence suggests that Veterans of more recent conflicts, such as
Operations Enduring and Iraqi Freedom, are also experiencing CMI.
 The general focus of my research is to determine the mechanisms that act to maintain chronic multi-
symptom illnesses (CMI) – such as myalgic encephalomyelitis / chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS),
fibromyalgia (FM), and GWI – with a career goal of improving the health and quality of life of deployed
Veterans. My research employs multiple state-of-art technologies that allow us to test the central, autonomic,
cardiopulmonary, and immune systems of each Veteran that visits my lab. As a result, my research has shown
that multiple physiological systems are dysfunctional in both GVs and civilians with CMI. Moreover, dysfunction
within these systems is magnified and symptoms are exacerbated following an exercise challenge (i.e., post-
exertion malaise [PEM]), providing a controllable model for their study. Thus, a central hypothesis of my
research is that dysfunction across multiple physiological systems interacts to produce and maintain the
symptoms of GWI, and this dysfunction is best studied by challenging physiological systems and testing how
they interact. Data from my lab has shown that GVs with chronic musculoskeletal pain have reduced white
matter health and that acute exercise makes them more sensitive to pain compared to healthy GVs. However,
my lab has also reported that being physically active has a potential protective effect against both the identified
deficits and the symptoms of these diseases. These results suggest that acute and chronic exercise may have
differential effects on GV health, important information for developing non-pharmacological therapies that can
be used to safely treat GWI.
 My current VA-sponsored research directly tests our multisystem hypothesis by comparing GVs with
GWI to healthy GVs across multiple physiological systems, at rest and following acute exercise challenge; we
use advanced statistical methods to test whether interactions among multiple systems significantly explain
symptoms of GWI. Capitalizing on the expertise of my lab and my collaborators, we test: 1) central nervous
system regulation using structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging; 2) autonomic regulation using
brain doppler methods for cerebral blood flow measurement; 3) immune and metabolic regulation using
measures of gene expression, metabolomics, and proteomics from blood; and 4) symptoms measurement
using validated instruments to assess pain, fatigue, and cognition.
 In summary, my research has produced important data that helps to inform the pathophysiology of
GWI, and by doing so has created physiological targets for future treatment trials. The goals of my research
program are directly in line with the mission of the Department of Veterans Affairs, to care for those who have
served this country, and thus I believe that I am well-qualified for a CSR&D Research Career Scientist Award."
10909400,"Deep brain stimulation is approved for a number of neurological disorders. However, the where, when and
how to stimulate the brain are still empirically solved. The goal of this proposal is to develop a systematic
framework that will enable a better understanding of the effects of deep brain stimulation. We will expand
The Virtual Brain (TVB), a computational model we developed, with a data-driven approach taking into
account cell-type specific control. The project relies on a tight interaction between experimentation and
computational modelling. First, using enhancer-based genetics, we will activate/silence specific cell types
with opto- /chemo-genetics while acquiring resting state and stimulus driven fMRI in individual mice. Each
brain will be virtualized in TVB and undergo data fitting, validation and inference using Stan, a platform for
statistical modeling. Model predictions will then be verified in the same individual mice. As a first step towards
an application in pathologies, the cells and parameters that need to be controlled will be predicted in silico to
stop seizures in experimental epilepsy, and to restore resting state dynamics and rescue motor behavior in
an experimental model of Parkinson's disease. Predictions will then be tested experimentally. The proposed
project will allow the generation and testing of hypotheses concerning the control of specific cell types with
unparalleled biological relevance, precision, and speed. The main goal is to show that it is possible to drive
brain activity with stimulation in a predictable way. Through cell type specific modeling of whole brain function
in mice, we aim to achieve a major milestone in the development of a realistic, large- scale, anatomical,
biophysical model of the human brain. Through unique expertise and technologies our international,
interdisciplinary team has pioneered, we will address the problem of understanding how brain stimulation
can be systematically designed for individual patients.
RELEVANCE (See instructions):
The success of deep brain stimulation in treating movement disorders led to its application to various
psychiatric and neurological disorders, in an attempt to treat symptoms as well as to directly improve
memory function. However, recent clinical trials failed to demonstrate significant effects in epilepsy,
depression and dementia, calling for new scientific developments to better understand where, how, and
when to stimulate the brain to obtain specific effects. Our experiments will provide fundamental mechanistic
insight into how the stimulations impact the brain and how it can be designed for optimal therapeutic
outcome in individual brains."
10911967,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Alzheimer’s disease is a severely debilitating disorder. It affects over 50 million people worldwide and its
associated costs are estimated to exceed $305 billion annually. By mid-century, 153 million people are
expected to be living with Alzheimer’s disease and costs are projected to surpass $1 trillion, as the global
population rapidly ages. Impaired working memory is a central feature of the cognitive deterioration in
Alzheimer’s disease and a primary driver of disability, placing sharp limits on social functioning, activities of
daily living, and quality of life. Working memory refers to our ability to hold behaviorally useful information in
mind over a period of seconds and is a fundamental building block of human cognition and the gateway to
long-term memory. Neuroscience investigations have demonstrated that working memory function is
subserved by oscillatory mechanisms in the healthy brain, and that specific patterns of synchronous oscillatory
dynamics may be important for understanding the disease mechanisms of Alzheimer’s disease, consistent with
the longstanding hypothesis of Alzheimer’s disease as a disconnection syndrome. Here, we examine the
mechanisms of working memory impairment in Alzheimer’s disease from a physiologically inspired perspective
centered on large-scale brain networks and how they interact through synchronized electrophysiological
oscillations. We focus on established neural coding schemes (i.e., cross-frequency coupling and phase
synchronization) hypothesized to index flexible large-scale circuits that integrate information across multiple
temporal and spatial scales during cognition. We combine high-density electroencephalographic
measurements of synchronized oscillations with personalized high-definition transcranial alternating-current
stimulation to determine whether it is possible to modify components of frontotemporal networks and cause
rapid improvements in working memory function. Our preliminary data are highly encouraging and indicate that
we can causally modulate the synchronization of long-range low-frequency oscillations, increase local phase-
amplitude coupling, and improve working memory capacity in people with Alzheimer’s disease to levels
equivalent to that of demographically matched healthy controls. The goals of the research program are to use
novel neuroscience tools and analytic procedures to gain a deeper understanding of the pathophysiology of
memory impairment in Alzheimer’s disease, and achieve concrete translational progress toward the
development of personalized, non-pharmacological interventions for improving memory and cognition in
Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias."
10827486,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Breast cancer is now the most prevalent cancer, with 2.3 million women diagnosed and 685,000 deaths
globally. Although, the death rate has declined by about 1% per year over the last decade due in large part to
earlier detection through screening, the current screening standard, digital mammography, lacks sensitivity and
is challenged in radiographically dense breasts. Sensitivity in dense breasts is improved by magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), but required contrast enhancement and substantial additional cost are drawbacks. A
non-contrast, low-cost alternative, ultrasound strain elastography (SE) has been shown to achieve high
sensitivity and specificity for breast cancer diagnosis. However, while SE diagnoses suspicious breast massed
by interrogating tissue stiffness, the underlying cause of stiffening is not discerned. Among the many possible
causes, stromal collagen organization is newly a focus of intense interest due to its recently proven association
with breast cancer stage, prognosis, treatment response, and other clinical features. Therefore, delineating
stromal collagen organization in vivo would not only improve breast cancer diagnosis and treatment
management but also help to elucidate the complex and poorly understood pathophysiology of breast cancer
development, progression, and aggressiveness. One approach to noninvasively evaluating stromal collagen
organization in the breast is ultrasound shear wave elastography (SWE), but shear wave propagation is
inhibited in 63% of malignant breast masses, leading to low-quality measurements. The lack of a robust
ultrasound approach to interrogating stromal collagen organization represents a major gap in exploiting a
rapidly emerging and highly promising biomarker for breast cancer. To fill this gap, our group has developed
Viscoelastic Response (VisR) ultrasound, an on-axis approach to interrogating collagen fiber organization via
stiffness anisotropy in breast masses and surrounding stroma without observing shear wave propagation. Our
preliminary in vivo data, acquired in 30 women with BIRADS-4 or -5 masses, demonstrate that VisR-derived
ratio of mass-to-surrounding tissue stiffness anisotropy (RMSA) differentiated biopsy-confirmed malignant
(n=9) from benign (n=21) breast masses with a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 89%. Further, in our pilot
feasibility study of four women monitored serially while undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), VisR
RMSA trended from malignant to benign indication with response to treatment. The success of our
investigations motivates further advancement of VisR RMSA measurement technology, its extension to
revealing the relationship between VisR RMSA outcomes and stromal collagen organization, and broader
application to cancer detection and treatment monitoring. We hypothesize: Advanced VisR RMSA correlates to
stromal collagen fiber organization, which is relevant to differentiating malignant from benign breast masses
and predicting pathologic complete response (pCR) to NAC in women, in vivo."

Tumor cells in TNBC tissue exhibit enhanced cell plasticity and stemness, which is crucial for cancer metastasis.
Metabolic and epigenetic reprogramming plays crucial roles in the regulation of cell plasticity. Succinate is an
intermediate metabolite of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Aberrant accumulation of succinate has been
detected in many cancers. However, the cellular function and regulation of succinate in breast cancer
development and progression have not been well investigated. We showed that the epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) was associated with profound changes in metabolites, including elevation of cytoplasmic
succinate. Importantly, treatment with the membrane permeable succinate was sufficient to induce mesenchymal
phenotypes, enhance cancer cell stemness and colonization, and reduce DNA hydroxymethylation and gene
transcription in mammary epithelial cells. Procollagen-Lysine, 2-Oxoglutarate 5-Dioxygenase 2 (PLOD2)
catalyzes lysine hydroxylation in endoplasmic reticulum and generates succinate as another product. We found
that PLOD2 expression was induced in cancer cells in TNBC tissue, and increased PLOD2 expression correlates
with poor prognosis and high chances of cancer metastasis. Silence of PLOD2 in cancer cells significant reduced
cancer cell colonization and metastasis. PLOD2 expression was induced during EMT and associated with
elevation of cytoplasmic succinate levels. Using gain- and loss-of function approaches, we showed that
increased PLOD2 expression is necessary and sufficient to enhance the accumulation of cytoplasmic succinate.
Importantly, silencing PLOD2 in breast cancer cells inhibited cancer cell stemness. The overall objective of this
project is to define roles of the PLOD2/succinate axis in regulating cancer cell plasticity and stemness, and to
evaluate biological activity of the new PLOD2 inhibitor in suppressing TNBC progression and metastasis. The
central hypothesis of this proposal is that PLOD2-induced succinate accumulation enhances cancer cell
plasticity and metastasis by reducing DNA hydroxymethylation; therefore, targeting the PLOD2/succinate axis is
a potential strategy to halt TNBC progression and metastasis. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following
aims: Aim 1. Elucidate the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which succinate enhances cancer cell plasticity
and stemness. Aim 2. Define roles of the PLOD2/succinate axis in regulating breast cancer progression. Aim 3.
Evaluate the potential of targeting PLOD2 to suppress breast cancer metastasis. Successfully completion of the
project will reveal novel function of collagen hydroxylation enzymes in regulating succinate-associated epigenetic
reprogramming and identify PLOD2 as a potential therapeutic target to suppress breast cancer metastasis."

The central role of the interferon (IFN) cytokines in innate antiviral responses has been recognized for decades
and many of the mechanisms underlying their induction and the responses they trigger have been worked out in
molecular detail. Much less well-understood, however, is the impact of IFN on the genetic structure of viral
populations within and between hosts. We hypothesize that the restriction of viral propagation imposed by IFNs
reduces the effective size of viral populations within infected hosts and contributes to tight bottlenecks during
transmission to new hosts. Owing to their different properties, we furthermore expect differing effects of type I
IFN and type III IFN (IFN-λ). We anticipate that both will restrict diversity within an infected host, but may do so
with differing kinetics. In addition, due to its localized action within the epithelium, we expect that IFN-λ
contributes to a further reduction in effective population size during transmission between hosts. To test these
hypotheses we will leverage two valuable experimental tools. The first constitutes the application of CRISPR
Cas-9 editing to generate guinea pigs that lack either IFNAR1 or IFNLR1, the receptors for type I IFN and IFN-
λ, respectively. Guinea pigs are naturally susceptible to a wide range of influenza A viruses (IAVs) and an
excellent model for following the longitudinal dynamics of infection within a host as well as transmission to new
hosts. The second tool is an IAV population carrying a highly diverse and fitness-neutral genetic barcode.
Monitoring barcode diversity through deep sequencing will allow us to determine the impact on viral dynamics of
disrupting IFN signaling. With this combination of host and viral genetics, we are well-positioned to uncover the
effects of type I IFN and IFN-λ, the lynch-pins of mammalian innate defenses, on viral genetic diversity and
evolutionary potential."

Motivated by soaring spending and stagnating life expectancy, the first 20 years of this Program Project Grant
(PPG) has focused on the causes and consequences of healthcare efficiency in the U.S. This work has
advanced fundamental scientific knowledge regarding sources of inefficiency and has motivated significant
changes in healthcare policy and delivery for millions of Americans. This competitive renewal responds to the
NIA’s prioritization of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD)-related research and to eliminating
health disparities by shifting the focus of this PPG to inequities in healthcare services and delivery for persons
with ADRD and with a lens on racial inequities. This is a new framework from the work to-date produced by
this PPG. Inequity is a particularly egregious form of healthcare inefficiency. Recent PPG research showed
excess mortality among older adults with ADRD, especially for Asian, Black, and Hispanic populations and
people living in nursing homes, even in areas with low COVID-19 prevalence. Intersectional inequities in
ADRD care delivery run the gamut from differential exposure to the modifiable risks that contribute to
development of ADRD, initial diagnosis and referral, ongoing treatment and support, and throughout later
stages, including end-of-life care. Conceptually, the determinants of individual health outcomes will be
documented among persons with ADRD from the social ecological perspective which recognizes nested
‘systems’ that interact with one another (individual, interpersonal, organizational, structural, community, and
policy) and their attendant social determinants of health. This PPG renewal, therefore, proposes projects
focusing on each concentric circle of this model and their interactions. Project 1 will explore state-level policy
heterogeneity and its influence on access to home and community-based services for nursing home eligible
adults with ADRD. Project 2 will test the hypothesis that having resident service coordinators for adults who
live in affordable senior housing decreases adverse health care service use and increases home and
community-based service use for low- income residents with ADRD. Project 3 will explore trends in the quality
of primary care for people with ADRD and to identify modifiable policy-, system- and practice-level factors that
contribute to better outcomes. Finally, Project 4 will develop a novel measure of bias in provider diagnostic
test ordering in the acute care setting and explore the impact of diagnosis on the trajectory of patients with
ADRD. Projects achieve synergy by using the social ecological model to examine how interactions among the
key variables examined in each project could operate together to improve outcomes and reduce inequities,
and by relying on shared administrative, data and analysis, and methodology cores."

Severe maternal morbidity (SMM) rates have risen 120-200% in the United States in the past two decades,1
and experts estimate that 40-60% of these cases are preventable.2,3 Suicide or self-harm related to postpartum
psychiatric issues, although typically reported separately from SMM, is the second leading cause of maternal
death.4,5 There additional intensive-acute psychiatric events (IAPE) that do not result in death not reflected in
statistics of SMM. Improvement initiatives are predominantly hospital-based and rely on women recognizing
their own symptoms and seeking care without ample support or education. We hypothesize that we can
improve patients’ self-efficacy and decision-making about when to seek care by helping them to self-monitor
symptoms and by providing decision support. We propose to develop a mHealth-based, patient-reported
outcome (PRO) and decision-support system to help mothers determine when to seek care for warning signs
of SMM. Our project focuses on diverse populations facing postpartum disparities, particularly African-
American and Spanish-speaking Latina women. The long-term goal is to enable Dr. Benda to leverage this
work into an independent research program, which will design, evaluate, and implement technologies to
improve health equity. Using the robust resources of Weill Cornell Medical College and external advisors, work
in the K99 phase will develop and validate a framework of design requirements for postpartum symptom
reporting and decision-support needs. In the R00 phase, Dr. Benda will independently design, evaluate, and
pilot a mHealth PRO and decision-support tool to improve knowledge and self-efficacy for postpartum patients
in the areas of SMM and IAPE. The specific aims are to: 1) develop and refine a framework of design
requirements for postpartum symptom reporting and decision-support needs; 2) design and evaluate a
functioning prototype of MOMS/MAMA through heuristic feedback with experts usability testing with patients;
and 3) conduct a pilot trial assessing the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of MOMS/MAMA for
improving knowledge and self-efficacy among postpartum patients at risk of SMM. To accomplish these aims,
we have assembled an interdisciplinary team with research expertise in informatics, nursing, public health,
minority health, clinical trials, and technology design and evaluation. Our team also has clinical domain
expertise in obstetrics/gynecology and psychology/psychiatry. Our proposal addresses important public health
issues (SMM and IAPE) and seeks to reduce disparities by targeting minority groups most affected by them.
Given the array of new competencies and the multidisciplinary nature of the patient-centered work, this
K99/R00 award is a necessary step to achieve the candidate’s career goal of designing technology-based
interventions to advance health equity."
10903876,"SUMMARY (Project 3)
The ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) is critical for the production of high-density lipoproteins
(HDL) and, in turn, for all the protective functions of that lipoprotein family. Numerous attempts have been
made to boost ABCA1-mediated lipid transport activity through various cellular and extracellular mechanisms.
For a variety of reasons, few of these have made it into the clinic. We believe that a major factor underlying the
failure to effectively exploit the ABCA1 pathway clinically is a fundamental lack of understanding of how the
transporter works at the molecular level. Taking a mechanistic and structural approach, both in silico and in wet
bench experiments, the main goal of Project 3 is to delineate the molecular mechanism behind ABCA1’s
action. Our work in the previous cycle of this Program Project led to a 3-step model that serves as the central
hypothesis of this work. Step 1: ABCA1 extracts lipid from the host cell’s outer membrane leaflet and moves it
into a hydrophobic tunnel in its extracellular domain (Segrest et al., ABCA1 is an extracellular PL translocase, Na-
ture Communications, 2022). Step 2: At a critical concentration of translocated lipid, ABCA1 dimerizes to com-
plete the formation of a lipid receptacle that fills with lipid. Step 3: The extracellular lipid receptacle creates a
highly specific dimeric binding site for APOA1 so that lipid extruded from the receptacle creates nascent HDL. Our
model is supported by MD studies that support the targeting of extracellular leaflet lipid and its accumulation in a
remote receptacle, by our refinement of the cryo-EM structure, which now strongly supports lipid extraction from
the outer leaflet, and by mutagenesis of key residues in ABCA1 and APOA1 driven by our models. Importantly,
our model explains observations that have been used to support both the direct binding and the microsolubiliza-
tion mechanisms. Aim 1 will integrate in silico and in vitro approaches to test four key aspects of our model. i) We
will experimentally determine if ABCA1 extracts lipids from the extracellular leaflet of the cell membrane and will
use MD studies to elucidate whether natural sequence variants in ABCA1 support the outer leaflet lipid extraction
model. ii) We will use MD simulations to visualize the effects of adding PLs into ABCA1’s proposed lipid recepta-
cle domain and evaluate the receptacle as a potential binding site for amphipathic helical apolipoproteins. iii) We
will test the requirement for ABCA1 dimerization via a series of point mutations predicted to alter dimerization. iv)
We will model APOA1’s interactions with a ‘clasp’ domain of ABCA1 that we believe is critical for HDL assembly.
Aim 2 presents direct evidence for ABCA1 self-interaction that is stable to detergent from cryo-EM data and pro-
poses to reconstruct the dimer in bilayers. We will reconstitute self-interacting ABCA1 into unilammelar liposomes
and novel oversized nanodisc platforms and characterize by cryo-EM. We will exploit our ABCA1 reconstitution
system to perform isotope-assisted chemical crosslinking experiments to: i) test intramolecular contacts predicted,
ii) verify that ABCA1 dimerizes, and test predicted intermolecular contacts, and iii) identify sites on both lipid-free
and lipid-associated APOA1 and ABCA1 that mediate interactions between the two molecules."

The goal of the Biospecimen, Metabolomics, and Pathology Core (BMP Core) is to create a federated, multi-
institutional resource to provide high-quality, clinically annotated biospecimens, metabolomic analyses, and
expert pathology review to all research projects in this SPORE application as well as future SPORE-sponsored
DRP and CEP projects, while serving as an unparalleled biospecimen resource to the broader endometrial
cancer research community. The Core will provide specific tissue and biosample-related services for each
SPORE project. In addition, the BMP Core will prospectively build a biospecimen resource bank at WUSTL,
OUHSC, and UNM by identifying cases of new and recurrent endometrial cancer at the participating institutions
and facilitating the consent and procurement process. Tissue and fluid biospecimens from these patients will
be collected, processed, and stored by leveraging the extensive infrastructure of existing biorepositories at the
participating institutions. Clinical data will be collected prospectively by integrating with and extending existing
clinical databases. Interactions with the Biostatistics Core will ensure interoperability of data tables maintained
at each institution. The BMP Core will provide access to the world-class Center for Metabolomics and Isotope
Tracing at WUSTL. Validated methods for sample processing and preservation, focused on optimizing
metabolic analyses, will be provided to increase the scientific utility of all biospecimens collected. A
transparent and equitable mechanism to publicize existing biospecimen resources and evaluate any request
for their use will be implemented. As such, the BMP Core will supplement existing cancer center resources
with focused expertise and effort to comprehensively collect, annotate, quality review, and distribute
biospecimens specifically for translational endometrial cancer research."

Vision research has accelerated toward a need to not only understand how visual stimuli are received and
processed in the brain, but towards the need to understand how the brain interprets, predicts, and ‘reasons’
about what it is seeing. Machine learning/computer vision (ML/CV) approaches are now essential tools to test
theories of deep vision/higher order vision, and investigators at Harvard have pioneered the development of
these algorithms to make fundamental discoveries regarding object and face recognition. To further develop this
research program, the Vision Core is launching a Computational Module that will support the development of
new methods in this area, and to provide expertise to vision labs that seek to apply ML/CV methods to their
research. The Module will be staffed by a ML/CV Specialist who will generate new models, create pipelines to
train models, and also curate models for the community. Vision researchers will specifically benefit from this
resource through access to a dedicated node on the HMS high-performance computing cluster, O2, which will
be managed by the ML/CV specialist. Lastly, the Computational Module will provide training and educational
workshops to the vision community to support the next generation of trainees interested in this highly impactful
area of research. The Module will be supervised by Dr. Gabriel Kreiman, a leading expert in the use and
development of ML/CV models in vision research, and a longstanding user of the Vision Core. By generating a

Non-neurogenic overactive bladder (OAB) (i.e. urinary urgency, with or without urgency urinary incontinence,
frequency, and nocturia) affects 1 in 7 U.S. men and women. It can be difficult to treat effectively, and the present
approach is one-size-fits-all, trial-and-error, in large part because the etiology of OAB remains unclear. A
substantive body of animal and ex vivo research implicates increased afferent activity and altered CNS
processing of excitatory signals in OAB pathophysiology, contributing to bladder hypersensitivity. However,
clinical characteristics that may reflect a bladder hypersensitivity state are poorly recognized and thus
phenotyping OAB based on afferent pathophysiologic mechanisms, which would be crucial for individualized
OAB care, has remained elusive. In response, we hypothesize that central sensitization (CS) is a
pathophysiologic mechanism underlying OAB in certain individuals, which might explain the bladder
hypersensitivity proposed in OAB. Findings from our preliminary work demonstrating elevated temporal
summation to pain (i.e. primary marker for CS indexed with quantitative sensory testing, TSP) in female OAB
patients appear to support this. Yet, we still know very little about how CS manifests in OAB, including how
relevant it may be for men with OAB. Therefore, we now propose that CS not only contributes to bladder
sensitivity, but also to psychosocial burdens, specifically increased negative affect (which is a frequent finding
both individuals with CS-mediated conditions and OAB), which then impacts bladder symptoms. We will test this
hypothesis with a sample of 200 men and women with OAB and 60 non-OAB controls, using a highly innovative,
interdisciplinary approach. Aim 1 identifies phenotypic features characteristic of CS in OAB, including greater
central sensory sensitivity, elevated psychosocial factors, co-morbidity with chronic pain conditions, and greater
urinary symptoms. Because CS links to OAB have not previously been examined in men, we will test for sex
differences in CS-related phenotypes. Aim 2 will directly test, for the first time, the effects of CS on bladder
sensitivity in OAB. Aim 3 will examine whether CS moderates the day-to-day negative affective influences on
OAB symptoms using a state-of-the-art ecological momentary assessment approach. When completed, we
expect to be able to identify OAB individuals with a mechanism-based phenotype (CS-associated OAB) defined
by signature mechanistic and phenotypic features for the first time. We anticipate that individuals with this CS-
OAB association, likely because of the high psychosocial impact and CS-mediated hypersensitivity, will be more
difficult to treat using standard OAB interventions (i.e. OAB medications) and may require multimodal or
advanced therapy. This will be assessed with future intervention studies to measure individualized OAB
treatment outcomes based on underlying CS mechanisms and determine causality of this OAB-CS association,
which will help usher in an era of precision medicine to optimize care of men and women with OAB."

Applikate Technologies has developed Clearing Histology with Multiphoton Microscopy (CHiMP), a novel
tissue processing and imaging platform that provides direct-to-digital images from intact pathology tissue
specimens, such as biopsies, without the need for wax embedding, slicing, or scanning of slides. The
application of this technology to cancer diagnosis will reduce errors, lower costs, ameliorate technician staffing
issues, and provide same-day diagnosis for patients waiting to hear if they have cancer.
The aim of this Phase IIb SBIR proposal is to support the development of risk management and quality
systems management required for the manufacture of clinical devices, as well as the clinical and non-clinical
validation testing required for an application for premarket approval by the FDA.
CHiMP has many advantages for general histology, including: H&E-like images familiar to pathologists but with
superior image quality, sub-micron effective thickness, and without artifacts common to slide preparation; non-
destructive imaging that preserves intact tissue for ancillary molecular analysis and immunohistochemistry;
rapid turnaround, with images ready within a few hours of receiving tissue; greatly reduced labor costs; true 3D
prospective; and digitized images for remote consultation and machine vision. The market for pathology
equipment and consumables is $2B, and for digital pathology scanners it is $1B. CHiMP is poised to not only
enter these markets as a unique and strong competitor, but to actually expand upon them by lowering the
barrier to entry for digital pathology through seamless integration into the laboratory workflow and raising the
value of equipment and supplies while still lowering overall costs to hospitals through significant labor savings.
The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) Perform risk analysis; 2)Develop and implement a Quality
Management System; 3) Collect data for an FDA premarket submission and facility registration.
Successful completion of these aims will enable CHiMP to enter the clinical diagnostic market, where it can
have maximum impact on patient care and health economics."

Older adults have more difficulty than younger adults identifying auditory (AO) and visual (VO) speech. Despite
these unisensory deficits, some older adults can identify audiovisual (AV) speech as accurately as younger
adults. Older adults have been found to exhibit more cross-modal plasticity, multisensory integration, and
frontal-cortical modulation of sensory input, but the extent to which these age-related changes are beneficial
and explain the conserved AV speech of older adults is a critical knowledge gap. The aims of the proposed
research program will use an innovative neural systems approach incorporating electrophysiology (EEG),
structural imaging (sMRI), and diffusion imaging (DKI) to characterize the specific neural mechanisms that
adapt with age to support AV speech. Source-constrained analyses incorporating EEG and sMRI will be used
to calculate potentials generated in specific regions of interest and the functional connectivity between regions
of interest. Cross-modal plasticity will be characterized by cross-sensory response amplitudes (visual-evoked
potentials generated in auditory cortex and auditory-evoked potentials generated in visual cortex) and the
functional connectivity between auditory and visual cortex (Aim 1). Multisensory integration will be
characterized by AV response amplitudes generated in temporoparietal cortex and the functional connectivity
between temporoparietal cortex and sensory cortex (Aim 2). Frontal-cortical modulation of sensory input will
be characterized by speech-evoked potentials generated in inferior frontal cortex and the functional
connectivity between inferior frontal cortex and sensory cortex and between inferior frontal cortex and
temporoparietal cortex (Aim 3). We hypothesize that the negative effects of age-related unisensory deficits on
AV speech perception will be ameliorated by greater reliance on cross-modal plasticity (Aim 1), multisensory
integration (Aim 2), and/or frontal-cortical modulation of sensory input (Aim 3). Though functional connectivity
is hypothesized to facilitate each of these mechanisms and conserve the AV speech of older adults, age-
related white matter degradation (DKI) is expected to limit functional connectivity, such that any age-related
increases in functional connectivity may be moderated by age-related deficits in white mater integrity. While we
hypothesize that each mechanism can on its own partially account for the conserved AV speech of some older
adults, individual differences and variability between mechanisms are expected to account for why some older
adults exhibit conserved AV speech perception while others do not. Importantly, we will also examine the
extent to which the conserved AV speech demonstrated by some older adults translates to better perceived
speech communication ability in day-to-day settings, as measured by self-report assessments. Identifying the
mechanisms important for the conservation of AV speech in older adults can elucidate new targets for
intervention to help preserve or even restore the communicative abilities of older adults with sensory deficits."

A leading contributor to the significant mortality burden of prostate cancer, the second cause of cancer death
among U.S. men, is the short-lived efficacy of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), the mainstay of care for
advanced and symptomatic disease. Increasingly alterations in DNA damage repair (DDR) genes,
predominantly BRCA2, have been linked to ADT resistance and poor prognosis. We previously showed that
deleterious alteration of BRCA2 is sufficient to induce ADT resistance in castration-sensitive prostate cancer
(PC) cells. Our current proposal will investigate the molecular mechanism underlying BRCA2 loss/mutation-
induced ADT resistance and progression to lethal prostate cancer.
Using a panel of 107 DDR-associated genes from the PROREPAIR B cohort, we made the novel observation
that ~82% of patients with mCRPC harbor alterations of one or more DDR genes. Herein, we aim to
comprehensively investigate the role of DDR alterations (other than BRCA2) in the development of mCRPC
and resistance to therapy. To do so, we will use CRISPR screening to prospectively investigate how the gain
or loss-of-function alterations of DDR genes induce castration resistance.
We have observed high expression levels of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) in response to the
loss of BRCA2 and other DDR genes (e.g., ATM). Our second aim will investigate the impact of PSMA-
targeted radiotherapy with [177Lu]-PSMA-617 and PARP inhibitor combination in BRCA2/DDR-deficient PC.
Prostate cancer is predominantly resistant to immunotherapy. Since BRCA2-deficient cells also exhibit higher
PSMA expression and are possibly immunogenic due to increased genomic instability, we will explore the
effect of PSMA-targeted CAR T cells on BRCA2-deficient prostate cancer. Finally, as two PARP inhibitors
(olaparib and rucaparib) have been approved to treat patients with DDR-deficient prostate cancer, we will
investigate whether PARP inhibitors synergize with CAR T-cell therapy.
For the first time, the proposed project will demonstrate the crucial importance of BRCA2/DDR alterations in
prostate cancer biology and possibly lay the foundation for consideration of DDR alteration as the master driver
of the transformation from indolent, localized prostate cancer to lethal mCRPC. We believe this work will lead
to clinical trials that will establish new and effective treatments for this deadly disease."
10897727,"A major barrier to effective treatment of the central nervous system (CNS) in most inherited lysosomal
storage diseases (LSD) is that the metabolic defect in all brain cells results in widespread pathology. The
therapeutic principle for most LSDs is to transfer a normal enzyme cDNA into a subset of diseased cells,
thereby correcting both vector-transduced cells and neighboring non-transduced cells that take up the secreted
therapeutic enzyme. To achieve global correction, transduced cells must be dispersed 3-dimensionally
throughout the brain so that secreted vector-encoded therapeutic enzyme can reach all non-transduced cells.
Although intravascular injection of certain AAV vector serotypes can cross the blood-brain barrier and deliver
genes widely in rodent brains, AAV vector distribution in large mammals occurs mostly in the lower brain and
spinal cord, limiting the potential for treatment. Thus, optimization of vector distribution in large animal models
of human diseases is critically needed to facilitate translation into clinical usage.
 In the prior grant period, we have shown that a novel AAV serotype (AAV.hu32) mediates widespread
gene delivery in a cat model of alpha-mannosidosis (AMD) caused by a mutation in the gene encoding
lysosomal a-mannosidase (MANB) that recapitulates the severe form of AMD. Notably, high doses of
AAV.hu32 encoding MANB resulted in global correction of the storage lesions and improvements in disease
parameters. Although this appears promising for translation into clinical usage, the vector doses required
would be near the limits of production for clinical grade AAV vector when scaled up to human patients and
there have been safety concerns raised in recent clinical trials for use of such high vector doses. Finally, new
preliminary data shows that vector doses that are completely effective when AMD cats are treated in the early
stages of the disease do not mediate complete brain correction when treatment is initiated at a more advanced
stage of disease, providing additional impetus to improve global brain delivery at lower vector doses.
 In exciting new studies, we have found that injection via carotid artery was even more effective than
intravenous injection, suggesting that passage of concentrated virus through the vascular bed of the brain
improves uptake. Surprisingly, we also found that while direct injection of AAV.hu32 into brain parenchyma
transduced oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and neurons, its vascular delivery resulted in the almost exclusive
transduction of neurons. Thus, current studies will focus on reducing the required vector dose by determining
the route the vector takes between blood and brain to specifically transduce neurons, increasing the levels of
MANB produced by the genetically corrected neurons, and increasing the number of transduced cells by an
alternative dosing regimen that will maximize vector uptake in the vascular bed of the brain. We will then
determine if an optimized combination of these strategies mediates global correction when treatment is started
at the advanced stage of disease of AMD cats, which will be the case for most human patients."

Pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration, PKAN, is a rare progressive neurodegenerative disorder
associated with iron accumulation in the brain. The disease causes early immobility and often death by early
adulthood. PKAN is caused by mutations in one of four human pantothenate kinase genes, PANK2 gene, which
encodes a mitochondrial pantothenate kinase. Consistent with the clinical presentation of PKAN in humans, cell
biological analyses from patient-derived cells as well as phenotypic characterization of mouse models of PKAN
have demonstrated that the loss of PANK2 activity results in major metabolic, cellular and physiological defects.
We have recently discovered that PKAN disease has the hallmarks of a mitochondrial disorder with large
accumulation of mitophagosomes. This has led us to discover a novel biomarker that could be used to
differentiate between PKAN and normal cells using cell imaging. To date, no specific or established therapy
exists for PKAN with most treatments directed towards managing symptoms and to slow disease progression.
We hypothesize that activation of the human PANK3 (hPANK3) enzyme would result in stimulation of CoA
production in PANK2 mutated cells and would represent an ideal treatment of PKAN. Chemical screening and
subsequent medicinal chemistry optimization (SAR) of the lead chemotype identified 9 human PANK3 activators
(VTAC1-9) that strongly activate hPANK3 with AC50 values in the nM range. These compounds do not affect the
activity of human PANK1 or PANK2, show no toxicity against four human cell lines and one primary human cell,
and have desirable functionality and solubility properties. Pharmacokinetics studies in mice with the early leads
VTAC1 and VTAC2 demonstrated both plasma and brain exposure, excellent t½, and no apparent toxicity.
Together these data indicate that these compounds are ideal candidates for the development of an effective and
safe PKAN therapy. The goal of the proposed research is to conduct detailed characterization of active
VTACs and a library of their analogs to identify late leads that could be advanced towards future clinical
development. Towards this end, we will pursue the following three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will complete
current SAR on this family compounds by characterizing the biochemical activity, selectivity and physico-
chemical properties of an already synthesized 29 analogs and an additional 200 compounds to be evaluated on
an iterative basis. In Aim 2, we will conduct cell-based assays to identify compounds with excellent in vitro

and PK analyses and evaluate the in vivo efficacy of VTAC1 and VTAC2 and new leads from Aim 1 in pank2-/-
mice by monitoring important PKAN biological metrics including activation of the CoA metabolic pathway, iron
homeostasis, mitochondrial metabolism, and rescue of PKAN-like phenotypes. The success of these studies will

10710041,"Stroke remains one of the leading causes of death and disability in the USA. The principal objective of the
current proposal is to test the efficacy of combined therapeutic hypothermia with whole body vibration on
post-stroke cognitive improvement using a model of stroke in aged rats. There are three main types of
stroke: transient ischemic attack, hemorrhagic stroke and acute ischemic stroke, with the latter constituting
87% of total stroke cases. Currently, the only clinical therapies available for acute ischemic stroke are
thrombolysis (tPA) and mechanical endovascular recanalization, both of which have only limited
applications in a small number of patients. Cognitive decline is one of the most significant problems
affecting almost two-thirds of stroke survivors for up to 6 years post-stroke. Therefore, identifying novel
neuroprotective strategies to improve post-stroke cognition remains a high priority. In animal models of
stroke (transient middle cerebral artery occlusion – tMCAO), behavioral studies yield evidence of deficits
in spatial, non-spatial, and motor learning. These deficits can be minimized in middle-aged rat models
of stroke with noninvasive whole body vibration (WBV) therapy. Likewise, long-standing research
from our laboratory shows that therapeutic hypothermia (TH) is a potent neuroprotective therapy in
experimental cerebral ischemia with multiple effects at several stages of the ischemic cascade. The
translational goal of our successful study will be to identify a novel therapeutic approach for stroke
rehabilitation that can be moved quickly to testing in clinical trials."

 Advanced age is the single most significant risk factor for cancer. Although there are many
plausible age-related mechanisms that mediate the increased risk for cancer in the elderly,
functional evidence is lacking for the majority of these mechanisms. This proposal will focus on
the role of the aged microenvironment, particularly senescence, in promoting the formation of
colorectal cancer (CRC), which is a common age-related cancer in the U.S. It is well established
that the majority of CRCs arise through the serial accumulation of mutations and epigenetic
alterations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in colon epithelial stem cells. However,
our group and others have found cells with cancer-causing DNA alterations (e.g. oncogenic KRAS
and TP53) in the histologically normal colon mucosa of people, which suggests that the DNA
alterations alone are not sufficient to drive the complete CRC formation process.
 Our group has recently shown that a senescent normal colon tissue microenvironment can
promote the neoplastic behavior of colon epithelial cells ex vivo. We found increased senescent
fibroblasts in the colons of the elderly and of people at high risk for CRC. We found that certain
senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors produced by senescent fibroblasts
can induce cancer hallmark behaviors through the activation of oncogenic signaling pathways.
Based on our preliminary data we hypothesize that senescent fibroblasts in older people and the
accompanying specific Senescence Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP) secreted proteins
promote the tumorigenesis of colon epithelial cells that have acquired age-related oncogenic
mutations, which we have defined as cancer-initiating cells. To provide direct functional evidence
to test this hypothesis, we propose the following Specific Aims:
AIM 1A. To determine whether senescent fibroblasts can promote the survival and/or
transformation of colon cancer initiating cells in ex vivo and in vivo organoid model systems.
AIM 1B. To determine the necessary and sufficient role of specific cancer-associated SASP
factors produced by the senescent fibroblasts in cancer formation.
AIM 2. To determine whether a senescent tissue microenvironment is necessary for the survival
and clonal expansion of mutant APC and mutant KRAS cancer-initiating cells using a well
characterized CRC mouse model, the inducible Villin-Cre;Apcflx/flx; KrasLSL-G12D (AK) mice, with two
approaches: AIM 2A: a pharmacological approach using the senomorphic drug rapamycin and
the senolytic drug treatment DNQ (dasatinib and quercetin) AIM 2B: a genetic approach using
the p16-3MR transgenic model, which allows the inducible ablation of senescent cells."
10918316,"Project Summary Abstract
In 2020, about 1 million female patients in the US will be living with pelvic cancers, and roughly half of them will
have received radiation during their course of treatment. The importance of optimizing cancer-directed and
supportive therapies to minimize the adverse effects of radiation and improve quality of life is increasingly
recognized. Among the many aspects of quality of life adversely impacted by cancer treatment is the ability to
continue engaging in pleasurable sexual behaviors, an essential human function throughout the lifespan, and a
clinical problem long overlooked in female cancer survivors. Current classifications of toxicity and normal tissues
in radiation oncology account only poorly for the anatomy and critical function of female erectile tissues (arousal
and orgasm) with respect to such patients' capacities to engage in pleasurable sexual behaviors. In addition, it
has yet to be tested whether observed alterations of vaginal and stool microbiome ecology after radiotherapy
contribute to increased susceptibility to radiation-induced vaginal toxicity and sexual dysfunction, as has been
explored recently in the context of radiation-induced gastrointestinal toxicity. Because roughly 70% of women
with pelvic malignancies now survive at least 5 years, it is imperative to identify predictors and mechanisms of
long-term female sexual dysfunction to improve quality of life given the significant role of sexual activity in overall
well-being. To accelerate advances in mitigating or preventing pelvic radiotherapy-associated female sexual
dysfunction, my proposed research aims to 1) establish a functional anatomic-domain (dermatologic, vaginal,
erectile) classification of long-term radiation-related sexual dysfunction in a multi-center, longitudinal cohort of
female patients undergoing pelvic radiotherapy; 2) define and/or validate novel dosimetric predictors of sexual
dysfunction in each anatomic domain; and, 3) identify quantitative imaging and microbiome biomarker indices of
radiation damage to specific sexual organs. My proposed study will be the first to analyze the effects of
radiotherapy on the erectile anatomic organs in females, and will thereby both elucidate the anatomic bases of
adverse sexual function outcomes, especially those related to arousal and orgasm, and advance overall
understanding of radiation effects for all female sexual anatomic domains. These advances will enable redesign
of radiotherapy protocols to improve such outcomes and identification of imaging biomarkers to assess dose-
volume response and the effectiveness of such interventions. In addition, we will be the first to test the
hypothesis that observed alterations of vaginal and stool microbiome ecology contribute to increased
susceptibility to radiation-induced vaginal toxicity and sexual dysfunction. I aim to pioneer key discoveries in
these underrepresented scientific areas to provide an innovative, tailored approaches to prevention, mitigation,
and treatment of radiotherapy-associated female sexual toxicities."

 Thermal therapy is a clinical intervention to eradicate cancerous tissue by increasing the temperature of
the tumors. Nanoparticle-mediated magnetic hyperthermia is a form of thermal therapy where magnetic
nanoparticles delivered to cancer sites generate heat after exposure to an external alternating magnetic field
(AMF). The goal of this project is to advance nanoparticle-mediated magnetic hyperthermia as a non-invasive
treatment for endometriosis. Endometriosis is a disorder where endometrium-like tissue is present at “ectopic”
sites outside of the uterus. The ectopic endometrium forms lesions that cause pelvic pain and infertility.
Despite advances in therapies for endometriosis-related pelvic pain, there remains no medical cure for the
disorder, and surgical removal of the lesions remains a treatment for many women. Unfortunately, the rate of
disease recurrence exceeds 50% with many patients requiring three or more surgeries. The premise of this
proposal is that magnetic hyperthermia can provide a non-surgical option to remove endometriotic lesions.
 Magnetic hyperthermia for cancer is currently restricted to the treatment of localized and accessible
tumors because the required therapeutic temperatures (≥42 0C) can only be achieved by direct intratumoral
injection of conventional magnetic nanoparticles. To address this limitation, this research team invented novel
magnetic nanoclusters with high heating capacity. The nanoclusters consist of hexagonal-shaped magnetic
nanoparticles encapsulated in polymeric vehicles. Animal studies validated that these nanoclusters are safe,
efficiently accumulate in cancer tumors after intravenous (IV) injection, and elevate the intratumoral
temperature to 44 0C in the presence of AMF. Preliminary studies revealed that following IV injection these
nanoclusters also efficiently accumulated in the macaque endometriotic lesions grafted into severe combined
immunodeficient (SCID) mice and exposure of these mice to external AMF after nanoclusters delivery
increased the temperature inside of the grafts up to 43 0C. To advance this new therapy this multidisciplinary
team of investigators with complementary expertise in nanomedicine, magnetic hyperthermia, and clinical
endometriosis research proposes in Specific Aim 1, to optimize targeting efficiency of these nanoclusters to
human and macaque endometriosis. Targeting will be optimized by modifying the surface of the nanoclusters
with peptides that specifically bind to receptors (e.g., vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor 2
(KDR)) overexpressed in primate endometriotic stromal cells. Binding specificity and therapeutic efficacy of
these new nanoclusters will be assessed in primary endometrial and endometriosis (human and macaque)
stromal cells in vitro. In Specific Aim 2, the effect of targeted versus non-targeted nanoclusters on the
eradication of endometriosis lesions will be evaluated in SCID mice engrafted with human and macaque
endometriotic grafts. In Specific Aim 3, safety and therapeutic efficacy of magnetic hyperthermia mediated by
the optimized nanoclusters will be evaluated in macaques with induced endometriotic lesions."

10925174,"PROJECT SUMMARY: 
American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) students are the least likely of any minoritized group to complete a 
bachelor’s degree and bachelors, masters, and doctoral degree attainment has remained the same or decreased since 
2000 in both STEM and non-STEM fields. This is despite AI/AN communities facing some of the largest disparities in 
health outcomes, thus justifying a critical need to train more AI/AN health scientists to improve health equity. The CA- 
NARCH SDP was established in 2003 and is a partnership between Indian Health Council (IHC), serving 9 regional 
tribes, and the academic partners of San Diego State University (SDSU), University of California San Diego (UCSD), 
California Sate University- San Marcos (CSUSM), and Palomar Community College (PCC). The CA-NARCH SDP has 
significantly addressed gaps in AI/AN academic achievement and has supported 135 students, with 97% being retained in 
their STEM programs over its 17 year history. Thus far, 10 students have received a PhD, with 18 additional students 
currently in PhD programs. 28 students have completed masters degrees, and 15 are currently in masters programs. 
Students are dedicated to working in Indian County and 17 students currently have full time positions in Indian Country; 
Two students have thus far become faculty members at 4 year universities. The aims of the CA-NARCH SDP include: 1) 
Identify and recruit AI/AN students in the biomedical and behavioral sciences from community college through graduate 
school into the CA-NARCH SDP program; 2) Retain AI/AN students in their respective higher education programs and 
develop and enhance their knowledge, skills, science-self efficacy, and persistence to succeed in STEM programs to 
successfully matriculate into graduate programs; 3) Engage and provide training for AI/AN students in biomedical and 
health research to increase their competitiveness for jobs/graduate school and their likelihood of becoming health/science 
researchers; 4) Increase the cultural interface and competencies of the CA-NARCH students and encourage AI/AN 
community engagement and trust in research. Centered at IHC, the CA-NARCH SDP has established infrastructure with a 
SDP team, including a full-time native coordinator (Luiseño), and an established presence and leads on the 4 surrounding 
campuses. Students are recruited from the 4 campuses, AI/AN organizations, faculty directors of NIH and NSD funded 
science enrichment programs, and from local tribes. Retention methods are multiple and include engaging students in 
research through existing NIH and NSF funded program, the CA-NARCH Directed Research (CANDR) program with 
campus and community based research, and in summer and yearlong research programs. Students receive continual 
mentorship from the CA NARCH SDP team, develop individual development plans, and will be assigned a cultural 
mentor who will provide additional guidance to students. Students will all participate in workshops and seminars that will 
enhance their science skills, provide training in indigenous research methods and that will expose students to established 
AI/AN researchers working in AI/AN communities. Cultural interface and community trust in research is enhanced by 
CA-NARCH SDP team and student presentations at community events and through cultural days. Evaluation of the 
program includes quantitative and qualitative measures and serves to assess program success and enhancement."

CDK9. It will discover whether clinically targetable CDKs are also epigenetic regulators and conduct pre-clinical
and clinical studies of combined epigenetic therapy and immunotherapy using CDK inhibitors, DNA
methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors. The Core will analyze (i) gene
expression and chromatin accessibility in tumor and immune cells in preclinical models of tumors treated with
CDK9 inhibitors, (ii) genome-wide effects of CDK4, 6 and 7 inhibition on DNA methylation and gene
expression, and (iii) support preclinical studies and a clinical trial combining CDK9, DNMT and immune
checkpoints inhibitors by the analysis of collected samples for transcriptomic and epigenetic parameters (gene
expression and expression of endogenous retroviruses and repetitive elements by RNA-seq, DNA methylation
by RRBS) and immune cell parameters (gene expression and markers of exhaustion in sorted T cells). The
Core will also perform whole exome sequencing (WES) to determine whether baseline DNA mutation and DNA
methylation profiles predict response. Project 2 is focused on epigenetic synergy between inhibitors of DNMT
and Polycomb repressive complex subunits EZH1/2 for therapy in solid tumors. The Core will analyze and
integrate DNA methylation, ChIP-seq, RNA-seq and WES data to assess the combinatory effects of DNMT and
EZH1/2 inhibitors and perform single-cell RNA-seq analysis of the tumor tissue to delineate tumor-associated
immune populations. Project 3 combines induction of inflammasome signaling by hypomethylating agents with

This competing renewal application is to continue our studies on the role of hybrid insulin peptides (HIPs) as
neo-epitopes for autoreactive CD4 T cells in autoimmune diabetes. During this very productive period we
have established that HIPs formed from insulin C-peptide and other β-cell granule proteins are antigens for
large numbers of autoreactive CD4 T cells in the pancreas of NOD mice, can be used in strategies to
induce antigen-specific tolerance, and are also present in human islets and PBMC of patients with type 1
diabetes (T1D). Our objective in the next period of the award will be to characterize new insulin (Ins) B-
chain HIPs and T cells reactive to these HIPs, in both NOD mice and human subjects. We hypothesize that
antigenicity of the much studied insulin B chain peptide, B:9-23, is due to hybrid peptide formation between
sequences of B:9-23 and cleavage peptide products of other granule proteins. The rationale for pursuing
these studies is based on preliminary data indicating that B-chain HIPs containing B9-23 sequences are
strong agonists for insulin-reactive T cell clones and that T cells reactive to these HIPs can be identified in
the polyclonal T cell population of NOD mice. Our aims for this next project period are to (1) investigate the
role of B-chain HIP-reactive T cells in disease pathogenesis; (2) determine whether tolerance can be
induced with insulin B-chain HIPs coupled to biodegradable nanoparticles in NOD models of spontaneous
disease and islet transplantation; and (3) investigate the presence of B-chain HIP-reactive CD4 T cells in
human T1D and develop new human tetramers containing B-chain HIPs. The B-chain HIPs will provide
further tools for understanding the autoimmune response to pancreatic β-cell antigens in general, and
specifically the contribution of insulin-reactive T cells to the disease process. We predict that these studies
will lead to generation of reagents not only for tracking disease-relevant T cells, but also for developing and
expanding approaches to antigen-specific therapy."

PROJECT SUMMARY
Despite the availability of anti-retroviral therapy, oral candidiasis caused by the overgrowth of Candida spp. is
the most frequent opportunistic infection among individuals living with HIV. The widespread use of azoles to treat
oral candidiasis in individuals living with HIV often results in treatment failure. In addition to antifungal resistance,
the current therapeutic options for oral candidiasis are limited by side effects the challenges posed by biofilm
drug recalcitrance. Moreover, Candida auris has recently emerged as a multi-drug–resistant fungal pathogen
and is classified as 1 of the 5 pathogens in the highest category—Urgent Threats—in the Antibiotic Resistance
Threats in the United States.
Polyphenols are secondary plant metabolites that have protective properties for human health, including
antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and antimicrobial activity. We found that caffeic acid phenethyl ester
(CAPE) and ellagic acid (EA) are both active against Candida spp., including C. auris resistant strains. The
minimum inhibitory concentration for EA ranged from 0.125 to 0.25 µg/mL and, at subinhibitory concentrations,
EA inhibited phospholipase production by C. auris. CAPE inhibited fungal filamentation and biofilm formation.
Both compounds were active in the invertebrate model hosts Caenorhabditis elegans and Galleria mellonella.
We further demonstrated that neither CAPE nor EA is toxic to human erythrocytes. Importantly, in a mouse
model of oral candidiasis, CAPE significantly increased the expression of the murine antifungal defensin β-
defensin 3 and reduced pseudomembranous lesions, invasion of hyphae on epithelium surfaces, tissue damage,
and inflammatory infiltrates.
The purpose of this proposal is to advance the development of these natural phenolic compounds for the
management of oral candidiasis. We have published “proof of concept” studies that gellan can be impregnated
with CAPE, and that the hydrogel is active in a mouse model of oral candidiasis. We will further advance these
goals with the following Aims: 1. To optimize hydrogels loaded with EA and/or CAPE for maximal release of
compounds and test their antifungal activity and cytotoxicity in vitro. 2. To test the optimized hydrogels loaded
with EA and/or CAPE in an established mouse model of oral candidiasis. 3. To test the antifungal immune
response to hydrogels loaded with EA and/or CAPE in the oral mucosa of volunteers living with HIV.
Our overall hypothesis is that the combination of CAPE and EA could provide an ideal natural treatment against
oral candidiasis with direct antifungal activity and activity against resistant strains (including C. auris), efficacy
against filaments and biofilms, and immunomodulatory activity through the production of antimicrobial peptides
and chemokines. In this context, the proposed studies could represent a pivotal stage in the development and
translation of these natural compounds as clinical antifungal agents.

10911137,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Modern antiretroviral treatments alter the progression of disease, enabling the majority of HIV+ individuals to live
near-normal life spans. Yet, ~ 20% of patients in the US fail to achieve long-term virologic suppression, and even
for those who do, there remains the threat of multiple comorbid complications. The critical questions that arise
are how will clinicians maximize treatment success, assess the sociobehavioral barriers to linkage and persistent
engagement in care, understand the causes of treatment and non-treatment related complications of HIV
disease, and develop interventions that maximize health and well-being of HIV infected persons over many
decades of life. To address these questions, investigators need access to clinical outcomes information that is
tightly linked to biologic specimens and socio-biologic and genetic data to enable translational research. The
CFAR Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS) project is an established resource that has contributed
substantially to the contemporary HIV research agenda. Established in 2002 and funded as an R24 research
platform in 2006, CNICS is a clinic-based research network that reflects the outcomes of clinical decisions and
management options used in the care of HIV infected individuals at 8 CFAR sites: UAB, U Washington, UCSF,
UCSD, Case Western Reserve, Fenway Health (Brown / Harvard), U North Carolina, and Johns Hopkins. What
makes CNICS unique is the way in which CNICS augments the comprehensive EHR data with a combination of
other resources for research that include patient-reported and patient-centered socio-behavioral data;
adjudication of key clinical events; strategic biological specimen collection; and genetic characterization of the
cohort. The mission of CNICS is to provide access to the specimen and data repository to any investigator who
submits an approved concept proposal. In this fashion, CNICS is a 'peer-reviewed open access' research
platform available to investigators worldwide. The specific aims for this competitive renewal of CNICS leverages
the robust CNICS foundation to accomplish the following: 1: Collect high quality data from a representative
sample of patients; 2: Enable investigators to perform research by providing data and specimens to a diverse
array of scientists worldwide; and 3: Mentor early to mid-career investigators engaged in HIV-focused research
in CNICS."
10908382,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Skeletal muscle and bone integrity progressively declines as we age, largely due to decreased levels of growth
factors and physical activity. Insulin-like Growth Factor-I (IGF-I) is a major mediator of muscle growth and
regeneration, specifically through the regulation of muscle stem cells (satellite cells) in order to repair damaged
muscle fibers. During aging, the gradual decrease in IGF-I levels contributes to the failure of the muscle growth
and regenerative capacity further causing loss of muscle mass and function; however, which cell in the muscle
provides the critical source of IGF-I have yet to be established. Thus, Aim 1 of this fellowship is to determine the
critical source of IGF-I in the muscle milieu that promotes muscle growth and regeneration, with novel mouse
models that ablate cell-specific IGF-I production, developed by the PI. The hypertrophic response of the muscle
beds from IGF-I has the potential to provide the benefits of mechanical loading to the bone. Indeed, muscular
contraction facilitates mechanical stimulation to the bone; however, physical inactivity in the aging population
decreases the ability of bones to sense and respond to mechanical forces, which contributes to the decline in
bone density and strength. Osteocytes are mature bone cells that sense and respond to mechanical stimuli from
the muscle, further directing the activity of osteoclasts (bone resorption) and osteoblasts (bone formation) for
bone remodeling. Perlecan (PLN) is essential for osteocyte mechanotransduction; however, PLN availability
decreases with age due to decreased mechanotransduction. Nonetheless, the effects of bone remodeling due
to decreased PLN expression in the osteocytic matrix remains unknown. Additionally, PLN is known to sequester
numerous growth factors; however, whether PLN serves as a growth factor reservoir to induce bone formation
is entirely unexplored. Therefore, Aim 2 of this proposal is to determine if PLN plays a role as a growth factor
reservoir in the ECM surrounding osteocytes that further enhances bone remodeling. This proposal will
investigate the mechanism of growth factors necessary to increase muscle and bone mass, in order to strengthen
the musculoskeletal system in the aging community. In the F99 phase of this proposed research, the PI will be
trained and mentored on muscle physiology to test the hypothesis that IGF-I ablation in satellite cells slows the
proliferation rate and impairs muscle growth and regeneration. Her work will be performed at the University of
Florida, which houses the Myology Institute providing rich resources from extensive muscle expertise. During
the K00 phase, the PI will perform her work with bone experts at the Indiana Center for Musculoskeletal Health
to test the hypothesis that PLN serves as a reservoir for growth factors in the osteocytic matrix for bone
remodeling. The completion of this work will provide mechanistic insight into the growth factors necessary to
increase muscle and bone mass, and will shed light to potential factors that interact in the muscle-bone unit. This
fellowship will aid in a successful transition from pre-doctoral to post-doctoral training, and develop a well-trained
junior scientist poised to independently investigate the muscle-bone interactions in aging and disease."

Built on two decades of experience with large coordinated NIAAA-funded research projects on HIV and alcohol,
The Veterans Aging Cohort Study (VACS) and our extended family of large, well characterized, national
Veterans Healthcare Administration (VA) Cohorts (VACo Family) offer an unprecedented resource for the study
of alcohol among people aging with and without HIV infection. Derived from Electronic Health Record (EHR),
and subjected to rigorous data cleaning and phenotype validation, the VACo Family shares common data
elements, including 20 years of longitudinal data on alcohol and health outcomes; it also includes behaviorally
similar uninfected individuals, allowing us to characterize the role of HIV infection in determining alcohol
associated outcomes; and supports targeted translational and intervention studies. To support excellence in the
questions addressed, study design and analyses, we have cultivated an international collaborative network of
experts. This well-established infrastructure has resulted in exceptional productivity. Our investigators have
used data from the VACo Family to produce >500 peer reviewed publications, cited >26,000 times (h-index 79).
We have successfully coordinated observational and intervention studies focused on the role of alcohol in
determining modifiable outcomes among people aging with and without HIV infection. We are also proud of the
education, training, career development, and leadership experience we offer young investigators, many of
whom have transitioned to independent NIH and VA funding. Our ongoing mission is to build and disseminate
the evidence needed to optimize care for people aging with HIV (PAH) experiencing medical harm from alcohol
through well-coordinated and fully integrated observational and intervention studies. With access to national
EHR data including medication fill/refill data, we are uniquely positioned to study harms associated with
concurrent use of alcohol and multiple medications (polypharmacy). In service to our larger mission, our
Program Project application supports the creation of the HIV and Alcohol Research center focused on
Polypharmacy (HARP) to address risks associated with harmful alcohol use and polypharmacy (AP risk). The
ADA Core, organized into administrative and data analytic sections, is composed of seasoned study
coordinators and an expanded group of experts in data management, high performance computing,
biostatistics, and artificial intelligence. The Core will address the challenges of cleaning and analyzing large
scale, longitudinal EHR data combined with other data sources (e.g., surveys, biomarkers, and genetics) to
support observational and pilot intervention studies. By facilitating and informing data access, analytic approach,
and maintaining excellent lines of communication with our larger network, the ADA Core will enhance the
significance and impact of HARP, providing experience and resources not available were projects funded
separately. With our experience, resources, and momentum, the ADA Core is uniquely positioned to address
AP risk among PAH."
10906191,"HARP RISK COMMUNICATION CORE PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of the HIV and Alcohol Research center focused on Polypharmacy (HARP) is to design and
implement effective personalized interventions for people aging with HIV (PAH) experiencing medical harm
from unhealthy alcohol use and polypharmacy. Communication of risks associated with unhealthy alcohol and
polypharmacy as part of an intervention to motivate behavior change deserves careful consideration. The
Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IMB) model, co-developed by Dr. Jeffrey Fisher, has been used
successfully for over 35 years to change diverse unhealthy behaviors. The model assumes that individual-level
weaknesses in critical information, motivation, and behavioral skills are responsible for much unhealthy
behavior. If these weaknesses can be identified and remediated through an intervention, significant and
sustained health behavior change will occur. Guided by Dr. Fisher, we will apply the IMB model to the task of
changing harmful alcohol use and polypharmacy. To further inform this effort, we have assembled a Risk
Communication Resource Core (RCC) of experts. RCC experts represent seven synergistic domains pertinent
to this effort. These include behavioral health, mixed methods, dissemination and implementation sciences,
shared decision making, pharmaco-genomic risk and counseling, and provider context, all set upon the
foundation of patient context and culture. This Core of experts will advise project teams on the design of a
series of interlinked pilot studies in HARP Projects 1 and 2, including selection of patient salient risk outcomes,
development of study instruments that account for the literacy and numeracy skills of participants, ensuring the
appropriate incorporation of core components of the IMB model for harmful alcohol use and polypharmacy in
all pilot studies, and reviewing and providing input on the interview guides used for semi-structured interviews.
This group will also inform the interpretation and integration of quantitative and qualitative findings across
HARP, including subgroup analyses, and all dissemination activities. Finally, the RCC will work with the HARP
Administrative Data Analytics Core and the larger HARP expert network to seamlessly integrate personalized,
patient-focused risk messaging across domains of research. The optimal approach for communicating alcohol
use and polypharmacy risks to effectively motivate behavior change is not yet well understood. The HARP Risk
Communication Core strategically builds on our existing expert network to facilitate effective personalized risk
communication to support behavioral change for PAH harmed by alcohol use and polypharmacy."

Dementia is a major global health challenge, and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) comprises 70% of dementia cases.
Because AD has no effective treatment options, the Lancet Commission recently emphasized the critical need
for effective, life-course prevention of AD. Epigenetic age acceleration (EAA), or increased DNA methylation
(DNAm)-based age relative to chronological age, was identified as a powerful biomarker of AD-related
neurobiological substrates and cognitive function in older adults. Likewise, our preliminary data
demonstrated associations between EAA and cognitive function in midlife, a critical epoch in brain health when
subclinical pathology first emerges, and dementia prevention may be most effective. Works by us and others
have also identified associations between cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and EAA, suggesting
that EAA could help to explain the intricate link between early life heart and midlife brain health. Despite these
intriguing data, prospective associations between childhood CVD risk factors and EAA in adulthood remain
unknown and temporal associations are not established. In addition, there is a paucity of research examining
the relationships of EAA with midlife cognitive function decline and AD-related neurobiological substrates. We
hypothesize that EAA is associated with cognitive decline and neurobiological substrates in midlife and
mediates the associations of early life CVD risk factors with these midlife brain health endpoints. To test this
hypothesis, we will leverage the rich resources of the Bogalusa Heart Study (BHS), including life-long
measures of CVD risk factors, three repeated measures of genome-wide DNAm in adulthood, and two midlife
measures of cognitive function over 11-years follow-up in the full cohort of 1,298 BHS participants (850 whites
and 448 African Americans). Furthermore, midlife AD-related neurobiological substrates from 3T magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) and amyloid photon emission tomography (PET) scans are also available in a
random subsample of 350 BHS participants. As part of the on-going visit cycle (2020-2024), we propose MRI
in another random subsample of 350 BHS participants, amyloid PET scans in another random subsample of
50 participants, along with an additional genome-wide DNAm measure in the full BHS cohort. With these data,
we will assess prospective and temporal associations of early life CVD risk factors with EAA (Aim 1); examine
the associations of EAA with 11-year changes in cognitive function (Aim 2) and neurobiological substrates in
midlife (Aim 3); and analyze the mediating effects of EAA on associations of childhood CVD risk factors with
midlife brain health endpoints (Aim 4). The molecular characterization of midlife brain health may have broad
implications, ranging from the improvement of risk stratification and sub-phenotyping efforts to the pinpointing
of molecular targets for drug development. Identifying CVD risk factor precursors to EAA might suggest optimal
strategies to prevent EAA and its brain-related sequelae."

 PILOT PROJECT CORE
In the past decade, nearly 90% of states in the U.S. have passed legislation legalizing the use of cannabis for
medical and/or recreational use. This has dramatically increased the access to CBD and high THC potency
cannabis products, readily available in an expanding commercial market. This rapid expansion underscores
the critical and urgent need for rigorous research to address many gaps in our scientific understanding of the
impact and health effects of cannabis use across the lifespan. Many of the research gaps and unanswered
questions about cannabis are early-stage scientific questions requiring preliminary pilot studies to inform the
directions for future research and where larger studies are warranted. The Pilot Project Core (PPC) of the RM-
CRC will function as an incubator of research innovation for the RM-CRC and the University of Colorado
Anschutz Medical Campus (UC-AMC) by establishing a rigorous and efficient process for competitive review,
selection, and funding of innovative pilot cannabis research projects that are foundational to informing
directions for future research in the form of new R01 grant submissions (Aims 1 & 3). The PPC will also
prioritize support for junior faculty who are embarking on cannabis-related research careers, but who have not
yet attained substantial funding. The PPC will place special emphasis on outreach and recruitment pipeline of
early-career investigators from groups that are underrepresented in medicine with substantial institutional
support from the University of Colorado School of Medicine. The RM-CRC and PPC will host an annual
institution-wide Cannabis Research Day at AMC. This and other PPC dissemination and outreach efforts will
encourage and attract both junior investigators and established investigators from a broad multiple
subspecialties, who may not have previously engaged in cannabis research, to apply for RM-CRC pilot grant
awards. The PPC will establish an environment that promotes the career development of new investigators
and fosters innovation and interdisciplinary cannabis research to expand the diversity of the UC-AMC research
portfolio and cannabis research community (Aim 2)."

CANNABIS RESEARCH ANALYTICS CORE
Scientific and public uncertainty exists regarding the health effects and harm of widely available cannabis
products and how these effects may vary across the lifespan. Some forms of cannabis (e.g., concentrates) have
substantially higher contents of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) than those available in the past. Our knowledge
about cannabinoid pharmacokinetics, drug metabolism and drug-drug interaction is still surprisingly
incomplete, especially when it comes to the more recently introduced variety of available cannabis
products. One of the main problems is the difficulty to estimate the exposure to cannabinoids. This is a rapidly
growing clinical problem as legalization of cannabis for medicinal and recreational purposes progresses and
healthcare providers are increasingly confronted with cannabis use among their patients. In this context the
primary AIM of the Cannabis Research Analytics Core (CRAC) is the centralization of functions that are
common to all projects with the focus of systematic evaluation of cannabinoid exposure and associated
changes in endocannabinoid system (ECS) and connected pathways. The evaluation of the effects of
cannabinoids and other cannabis components (e.g., terpenes) on physiological processes and endogenous
biomarker homeostasis at different stages in life is essential for the accurate interpretation of the
pharmacodynamic properties of the components in cannabis. We propose to carry out the following 3 aims: AIM
1. Drug Exposure Assessment. Data gained from these cannabinoid and terpene analyses will give insights
regarding cannabinoid and terpene exposure and drug-drug interactions. CRAC will also generate a sample
repository. This will be the first biobank of its kind, focused on study of samples from cannabis users during
different stages in life. AIM 2. Biomarker Changes Assessment. Data gained from biomarker analyses will give
insights regarding cannabinoid associated pharmacodynamic changes in the endocannabinoid system, energy
metabolism (metabolomics) and the inflammatory status (lipidomics). These parameters constitute the basis for
differences in the benefits or harm of effects of cannabinoids across the lifespan of cannabis users. AIM 3.
Evaluation of Population Pharmacokinetics to Estimate Individual Exposure and Health Risks. CRAC will
address critical important gaps in clinical and scientific knowledge of cannabinoid exposures by developing and
validating methods to estimate an individual’s exposure to cannabinoids, using the sparse sampling data from
the proposed research projects in combination with published population pharmacokinetics (PK)/
pharmacodynamics (PD) modeling. The cannabinoid PK/PD models will evaluate the relationships between
cannabinoid exposure and health risks and possible benefits across the lifespan. Impact on the field: The
services of the CRAC will enable investigators to estimate cannabinoid exposure as well associated changes in
metabolic, physiological, and mental functions in cannabis users over their lifetime."
10912682,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
DATA HARMONIZATION AND ANALYSIS CORE
In the last six years, the United States has witnessed enormous changes concerning the public acceptance of
cannabis. In short, cannabis and hemp products are widely available in North America. A critical but
unexplored aspect of cannabis legalization is the extent to which the health effects of cannabis products
depend on the ratio of THC and CBD, how endocannabinoids may mediate these effects, and how these
effects may vary across the lifespan. The endocannabinoid system (ECS), which is a combination of CB1 and
CB2 receptors as well as a number of endogenous ligands (2-AG, AEA) and lipid mediators, changes
dramatically over the lifespan and likely mediates the effects of cannabinoids on the brain and immune system.
To understand the neurocognitive and health effects of THC and CBD, it is imperative to understand their
effects on the ECS. The Data Harmonization and Analysis Core (DHAC) will harmonize the clinical data,
neurocognitive data, and the measurement of THC, CBD, metabolites, and endocannabinoids in blood to
understand how THC and CBD influence the ECS and how changes in the ECS may mediate the effects of
THC and CBD across the lifespan. To that end, the DHAC will develop and deploy a system for the support of
the data collection, data harmonization, data analysis and data sharing needs of the RM-CRC (Aim 1). The
DHAC will also harmonize clinical, cannabinoid and metabolite data, endocannabinoid and lipid mediator data
from seven existing R01s (n=1359) in order to enable advanced machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)
analyses to identify a panel of analytes that will be examined broadly in the RM-CRC and beyond (Aim 2). The
DHAC will also conduct specialized analyses of the harmonized P50 project data to construct and test cross-
groups simultaneous structural equation models describing how the effects of THC and CBD on the ECS and
the association with downstream neurocognitive and clinical variables change across the lifespan (Aim 3).
Finally, the DHAC will conduct analyses of ABCD data to examine the effects of THC and CBD in adolescents
and to determine if ECS analytes are related to trajectory of brain development and substance use and provide
a platform for future ML analyses of harmonized neuroimaging, clinical, and biological data to determine how
THC and CBD and the ECS are associated with changes in structural and functional measures of connectivity
in the brain (Aim 4)."
10909925,"BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is a benign inflammatory immunological disorder characterized by
hyperproliferation of the epidermis. The role of stem cell (SC) divisional behavior in the hyperproliferation of
psoriasis has not been addressed previously.
PRELIMINARY DATA: As part of our last completed Merit Review we provided evidence to show that while
oncogenic hyperproliferation is associated with symmetric SC divisions (producing increased numbers of SCs),
benign hyperproliferation is associated with increased asymmetric SC divisions (no change in SC number). In
studies subsequent to the previous Merit, we showed that the increase in asymmetric SC divisions in psoriasis
was interleukin 17A dependent (Charruyer et al, 2017).
HYPOTHESES: in Aim 1 we hypothesize that the observed increase in SC divisions is due to an increase in
actively cycling SCs rather than a change in cell cycle duration, and that the increase in progenitor transit
amplifying cells (TACs) in the suprabasal layer is a downstream consequence of the change in SC behavior
rather than an increase in 'rounds' of TAC divisions. In Aim 2 we hypothesize that genes associated with
signaling pathways related to SC quiescence and to asymmetric SC division will be differentially expressed in
the SCs of interleukin 17A versus vehicle-treated keratinocytes.
SHORT TERM GOALS: In Aim 1 we will complete studies to fully elucidate how altered SC and TAC kinetics
result in the acanthotic (thickened) epidermis of psoriasis. In Aim 2 we will determine the changes in gene
pathways underlying the altered SC behavior; pathways associated with quiescence and asymmetric SC
division, using RNAseq and then validate these genes/pathways as relevant for psoriasis and for keratinocyte
SC self-renewal using normal and psoriasis human keratinocytes.
LONG TERM GOALS: The studies of Aim 1 are designed to enable a relevant new mathematical modeling of
psoriasis as a future goal. Aim 2 will elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying the alterations in Aim 1 and
provide strategies for manipulation of SC divisional behavior. Along with better understanding
hyperproliferative diseases, these studies will move us closer to important therapeutic goals: to target
quiescent/dormant cancer cells that escape conventional therapies, to decrease SC quiescence/ increase
symmetric SC divisions to aid wound healing, and to restore homeostasis between the balance of asymmetric
and symmetric SC divisions in the treatment of psoriasis and other hyperproliferative diseases."

fellows. The program emphasizes the functional, structural and molecular properties of skeletal, cardiac and
smooth muscle, and how these properties are compromised in various disease states. Our 18 faculty members
come from 2 basic science departments (Biochemistry & Molecular Biology and Physiology) and 5 clinical
departments (Medicine, Orthopedics, Pathology, Physical Therapy & Rehabilitation, and Surgery) at the
University of Maryland School of Medicine. Affiliate faculty also come from the Departments of Mechanical
Engineering and Mathematics & Statistics at our sister campus, University of Maryland Baltimore County, and
from Morgan State University. Trainees are drawn from all of the participating departments and from our
interdepartmental PhD Programs. Indicative of the diversity of our faculty backgrounds, the training offered is
multifaceted ranging from the molecular determinants of muscle development through the cell biological aspects
of muscle cytoskeleton, membranes and matrix, to the biophysical analysis of individual muscle cell function and
the biomechanical evaluation of whole muscles to the effects of muscle disease at all these levels of
investigation. Our faculty is nationally and internationally recognized in the areas of Ca2+ control of muscle
function and membrane systems, muscle cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix, muscle development, growth
and plasticity, as well as muscle disease, injury and aging. Our students will receive training in these and in a
variety of related areas, with emphasis on the use of complementary state-of-the-art technologies to address
each question under examination. The major didactic aspect of our training is two one-semester interdisciplinary
courses on muscle biology, which are team-taught by the program faculty and have been well received by past
trainees, and a seminar series focusing on muscle related techniques, technologies and model systems.
Program activities comprise an annual on campus Mini-Retreat which includes trainee poster and oral
presentations and a renowned muscle researcher as Program visitor and Keynote Speaker, a semi-annual Wade
Memorial lectureship and lunch meetings for all trainees, as well as training in professional career development,
grant and manuscript writing, the principles of rigor and reproducibility, and the responsible conduct of research.
We will continue at our present level of 5 predoctoral and 5 postdoctoral trainees throughout the renewal period.
Entering predoctoral trainees will be required to have a strong background in biological sciences and praising
recommendation letters. Incoming postdoctoral trainees will have completed a solid PhD thesis, and also have
strong recommendation letters. Trainees from this program will be prepared to bring a wide range of approaches
to bear on answering fundamental questions in muscle biology and on the causes of muscle diseases as well as
their possible treatment and ultimately cure. This program therefore serves a national need for preparing highly
competent investigators with multi-disciplinary training in the area of muscle biology and disease."
10873814,"Project Summary
Serum IgM have crucial “housekeeping” functions such as the clearance of apoptotic cells and cellular debris,
preventing their accumulation in tissue. However, despite their important role, IgM have been largely
understudied in comparison to other immunoglobulin isotypes, especially IgG. A central characteristic of serum
IgM linked to their biological function is their reactivity to simple chemical moieties exposed on cell membranes
and macromolecules. For instance, IgM bind to phosphorylcholine on apoptotic cells to promote their elimination.
These moieties form adducts when attached to proteins or other macromolecules. Remarkably, only a few
chemical adducts recognized by serum IgM have been identified thus far. Whether these are examples of a
much larger group of chemical radicals targeted by serum IgM is unknown. To address this knowledge gap, we
developed a high-dimensional platform to assess monoclonal IgM and serum IgM reactivity to 87 ubiquitous
adducts. Results showed that: 1) monoclonal “polyreactive” IgM cloned from memory blood B cells and binding
to apoptotic cells, hence displaying a typical “natural antibody” profile, react in fact to specific adducts; 2) the
anti-adduct IgM repertoire is highly restricted in newborns and only includes reactivity to a limited number of
adducts; 3) IgM reactivity diversifies abruptly around 6 months of age, marking a transition from a restricted
neonatal repertoire to a broad adult repertoire and 4) this transition appears to coincide with exposure to
environmental antigens. Overall, these studies uncovered a much more complex anti-adduct IgM immunity than
was initially anticipated. Yet, several important questions remain unanswered: What are the functional niches of
anti-adduct B cells/PC? Do anti-adduct B cells constitute a distinct subset with specific phenotypic
characteristics? What is the role of anti-adduct IgM in efferocytosis and regulation of inflammation? Are these
functions dependent on the IgM specificity to individual adducts? Our proposed studies will address these salient
questions through the characterization of anti-adduct B cell and PC at the single-cell level.
Specific aim-1. To characterize anti-adduct memory B cells and plasma cells and map their niches
We will first detect anti-adduct memory IgM+ B cells and IgM-secreting cells in the bone marrow, spleen, thymus
and gut-associated lymphoid tissue in order to identify their main niches. We will then characterize the phenotype
of anti-adduct memory IgM+ B cells using flow cytometry and single-cell-RNA-seq combined with BCR-seq to
profile their transcriptome and evaluate their clonal composition in vivo.
Specific aim-2. To determine the role of anti-adduct IgM in regulation of efferocytosis and inflammation
In specific aim 2 we will examine the capacity of IgM mab specific to individual adducts to opsonize apoptotic
cells and enhance their clearance by different types of phagocytes. We will also investigate the role of
complement in this function. In a second part, we will examine whether apoptotic cells opsonized by IgM reactive
to different adducts trigger distinct cytokine secretion upon their uptake by phagocytes."
10775836,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Since the 2007 call for malaria eradication, research and programmatic efforts have shifted from controlling
malaria through identification and treatment of clinical disease to elimination of infection and interruption of
malaria transmission. Efforts to reduce malaria transmission include interventions to kill the mosquito vector
and/or reduce vector biting or to reduce human to mosquito transmission of gametocytes, the sexual stage of
the malaria parasite, through treatment or transmission-blocking vaccines. Recent studies have delineated the
molecular mechanisms underlying parasite sexual commitment and gametocyte development. In particular, the
identification of AP2-G as a master regulator of gametocytogenesis has allowed quantification of parasite sexual
commitment based on estimates of ap2-g expression. Approximately, 1 – 30% of parasites in an infection
express ap2-g, suggesting that not all asexual parasites in an infection commit to produce gametocytes.
However, the factors that contribute to parasite investment in sexual reproduction are not fully understood.
Several studies have identified associations between host, parasite, and environmental factors and
gametocytemia. A potentially important factor that requires more in-depth evaluation is the impact of polyclonality
on parasite sexual investment. Evolutionary theory suggests that competition of co-infecting parasite clones in
a polyclonal infection can influence the balance in investment in asexual replication versus sexual differentiation;
however, limited research has been performed to understand how within-host clone interactions impact
gametocyte production in P. falciparum infections. Because a large proportion of infections in high transmission
areas are polyclonal, understanding how infection complexity impacts sexual commitment and gametocytemia
is important for predicting the impact of new interventions on malaria transmission. Likewise, as transmission
(and infection complexity) decrease in response to interventions, understanding the relationship between
infection complexity and transmission may allow identification of transmission reservoirs in the face of changing
malaria epidemiology. In this study, we will examine the impact of host, parasite, and environmental factors on
P. falciparum sexual commitment and gametocytemia in infections occurring in a longitudinal cohort study
conducted in Malawi, based on expression of the ap2-g gene and male and female gametocyte-specific genes.
In addition, we will use a newly developed gametocyte genotyping marker to examine how infection complexity
and clone composition are associated with relative frequency and/or presence of gametocytes of a given clone
within an infection. By investigating these factors in parasites from individuals followed longitudinally, we hope
to gain insights into parasite biology and the impact of infection complexity on parasite sexual investment, and
to discover actionable associations that allow identification of target populations for transmission-reducing
interventions."

Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death
in American males. Androgen deprivation therapies and androgen receptor (AR) pathway inhibitors extend
patient lifespan, yet resistance often develops, leading to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).
Immunotherapies, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), have shown great promise in some cancers.
However, CRPC has displayed a poor response to ICI, mainly due to tumor infiltration by immunosuppressive
cells, such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAM). The
accumulation of these cells inhibits CD4+/CD8+ T cell growth and activity, leading to an immunosuppressive
tumor-immune microenvironment (TIME). MDSCs and TAMs are attracted by inflammatory cytokines that are
secreted by the tumor cells under the regulation of tumor-intrinsic factors. FOXA1 is a transcription factor that
is required for normal prostate development and differentiation. However, FOXA1 is down-regulated in CRPC,
and somatic point mutations of FOXA1 were found in about 12-13% of metastatic CRPC. We have previously
shown that FOXA1 loss or mutations increase epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), lineage plasticity,
cell motility, and PCa metastasis by inducing inflammatory cytokines such as TGFB3 and IL8. However, how
FOXA1 acts as a transcriptional repressor and whether FOXA1 regulates the immune landscape of PCa
remain unknown. In preliminary studies, we found that FOXA1 inhibits a panel of inflammatory cytokines, such
as TNFĮ, CCL2, CCL20, CXCL5, TGFB3, and IL8 that are known to recruit MDSCs and TAMs.
Mechanistically, we observed that FOXA1 protein interacts with ARID1A, a subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin
remodeling complex that has been shown to act as a transcriptional repressor and inhibit inflammatory
cytokines in ovarian cancer. Critically, analyses of a transgenic mouse model with prostate-specific co-deletion
of Foxa1 and Pten showed a more aggressive tumor with massive macrophage infiltration than the Pten mice.
We thus hypothesize that 1) FOXA1 recruits ARID1A protein to the chromatin for epigenetic remodeling and
transcriptional repression, 2) FOXA1 loss or mutation unleashes ARID1A, leading to inflammatory cytokine
induction, an immunosuppressive TIME, and PCa progression. To test these hypotheses, in Aim 1, we will
investigate FOXA1 and ARID1A protein interaction in PCa, co-occupancy on the chromatin, and mutual
dependency for transcriptional repression of inflammatory cytokines. We will also determine how these
functions are disrupted by PCa-associated FOXA1 mutations. Aim 2 will investigate how Foxa1 depletion in
the transgenic mice affects PCa progression, Arida1a function, cytokine induction, and tumor immune
infiltration and further validate the pathway in human CRPC tissues."

 The goal of the proposed Behavioral and Integrative Treatment Development Program (R34) is to
develop and test a mobile health (mHealth) application of evidence-based behavioral treatment for sleep
problems in persons beginning treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) with medications for OUD (MOUD).
OUD is a highly prevalent problem with major public health implications. MOUD is the first-line treatment for
OUD, though sleep complaints in persons receiving MOUD are highly prevalent, persistent, and connected to
negative treatment outcomes. Interventions for insomnia and other sleep problems in those receiving MOUD
are lacking, as pharmacological options are limited and there are multiple barriers to receiving evidence-based
non-pharmacological/cognitive behavioral treatment, including competing treatment demands, lack of trained
providers, and time and effort involved in in-person sessions. Modifying evidence-based behavioral sleep
interventions for delivery via a patient-focused mobile application with special consideration to factors specific
to persons receiving MOUD would fill this treatment gap by circumventing many of these obstacles related to
accessing in-person treatment. The proposed research will develop and test a behavioral sleep medicine-
based mobile application that includes components of interventions for sleep problems that are highly
prevalent in MOUD treatment, including insomnia, circadian rhythm disorders, nightmares, and pain-related
sleep difficulty. The ultimate goal of this project is to prepare for a large scale randomized clinical trial. Specific
aims include: 1) Develop a mHealth application, NightRighter, based on cognitive behavioral therapy for
insomnia and augmented with other evidence-based sleep interventions that address common sleep-related
problems in OUD/MOUD utilizing input from persons beginning MOUD (n=5), stabilized on MOUD (n=5) or
providing treatment for those receiving MOUD (n=5); 2) Run usability tests of NightRighter through alpha and
beta testing (n=15-20); 3) Conduct a pilot randomized clinical trial (RCT) of NightRighter compared to a sleep
hygiene control group (n=40) in preparation for a larger RCT. This proposal leverages the skills and expertise
of all team members, including measurement of sleep problems in OUD of Dr. Wilkerson, OUD clinical care
and clinical research experience of Drs. Book and McCrae, implementation of digital health tools of Dr.
Ruggiero, and qualitative data collection and analyses in substance use disorders of Dr. Moreland."

Dr. Karen Jakubowski is an early career clinical scientist and emerging expert on the relationship of interpersonal
trauma to women’s cardiovascular health. The objective of this NHLBI Mentored Patient-Oriented Research
Career Development Award (K23) is to study the relation of intimate partner violence (IPV) to subclinical
cardiovascular disease (CVD) in midlife women and to test the role of poor sleep as a mechanism linking IPV
and subclinical CVD. CVD is the leading cause of death among women. Psychosocial factors, such as childhood
abuse and chronic stress in adulthood, have been related to CVD risk. However, IPV, a type of interpersonal
trauma reported by over 35% of U.S. women, is poorly understood in relation to CVD. Midlife is a critical time to
study relations of IPV to CVD. Midlife is a period of biological and psychosocial transition for women that is often
accompanied by accumulating CVD risk. Subclinical CVD measures provide objective indices of CVD risk among
midlife women and have not been studied in relation to IPV. Key mechanisms, such as poor sleep, may link IPV
to subclinical CVD. Understanding whether and how IPV is related to CVD risk is necessary to develop tailored
interventions to improve midlife women’s cardiovascular health. Prior research is limited by a reliance on
retrospective self-report measures of CVD and sleep, lack of consideration of contextual factors that initiate and
maintain poor sleep in trauma-exposed populations, and a focus on younger women. The proposed training plan
will address three training areas: (1) midlife women’s cardiovascular health and measurement of subclinical CVD,
(2) IPV and conducting research with trauma-exposed populations, and (3) ecological momentary assessment
(EMA) methods and analysis for behavioral sleep medicine research. The Candidate has assembled an
interdisciplinary mentorship team to achieve these training aims. The proposed study will investigate the relation
of IPV to subclinical CVD in a sample of midlife women with and without a past history of IPV (N=100), using a
multidimensional measure of IPV (type, chronicity) and indices of subclinical CVD (carotid intima media thickness
and plaque). Women will provide one week of EMA (sleep quality, vigilance) and actigraphy (sleep continuity),
which will provide objective indices of sleep and capture momentary social, cognitive, and behavioral factors that
initiate and maintain poor sleep in trauma-exposed samples. Study aims are to: (1) Test whether women with a
history of IPV show greater subclinical CVD than women without this history; (2) Test whether women with a
history of IPV show worse sleep and more vigilance than women without this history; (3) Test whether poor sleep
and vigilance are related to subclinical CVD and the role of sleep/vigilance in relations of IPV to subclinical CVD.
Results have the potential to elucidate the role of IPV in women’s cardiovascular health and suggest targets for
future intervention to reduce CVD risk in midlife women. The proposed research and training aims align with
NHLBI’s efforts to identify social determinants of CVD in women. Research and career development activities
will prepare the candidate to be an independent investigator and expert in IPV and midlife women’s CVD."

The overall mission of the proposed Vision Core is to continue to enhance vision research at Harvard by providing
vision scientists with resources and facilities that could not be supported by individual laboratories. Specifically,
the structure and operation of the Vision Core have been designed around three key objectives: (1) the design,
optimization, and manufacture of custom equipment and reagents for investigators; (2) the dissemination and
teaching of new methods and approaches for vision studies through a community of systems and cellular
neuroscientists, engineers, machinists, and biologists; and (3) the seeding of new collaborations through the
transfer of ideas and experimental strategies among investigators. In this capacity, the Vision Core grant
currently supports 17 vision research labs at Harvard with 21 qualifying NEI awards.
In support of these goals the proposed Vision Core includes three modules, and has undergone a major
restructuring since the last funding period in response to the needs of vision researchers at Harvard. A newly
merged Neuroengineering and Fabrication module will provide hardware and software solutions to the vision
research community. A Viral Module supports critical anatomical and functional experiments using viral
constructs and will enhance the range of vision research supported by the Core. Lastly, a newly proposed
Computational Module will provide expertise and dedicated computing power to develop and train new
algorithms to test theories of vision science. Each module is under the direction of an accomplished and capable
faculty member that studies vision, and experienced staff that run the module on a day-to-day basis, overseen
by the Administrative Core. Harvard Medical School has provided significant institutional support for these
modules in the form of space, renovation costs, internal grant support for equipment and operational costs, and
financial administrative support; however, continued external support of the Harvard Vision Core is essential for
maintaining a high level of productivity in the vision community at Harvard, fostering and supporting collaborative
efforts, and attracting new scientists to vision research."

propelling the PET-RTRC forward and sustaining its long term operation. To fulfill our objective we will address
the following Specific Aims:
Aim 1: In responding to the scientific needs of the Collaborative Projects (CPs), the three Technological
Research & Development Projects (TR&Ds 1-3) will build upon their successful innovations during the current
funding cycle to develop radiotracers that target different components of inflammation, their dynamic variation,
and consequences such as inflammasome activation (TR&D 1: sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-2),
monocyte/macrophage trafficking (TR&D 2: chemokine C receptor 2/CD163) and the induction of mitochondrial
stress (TR&D 3: mitochondrial reactive oxygen species). Aim 2: Given the importance of the CPs as technology
drivers, we will further enhance the “push-pull” interaction between the individual TR&Ds and their respective
CPs by including strategies that enhance cross-site communication, more robust training opportunities,
optimized image analysis and data management and facilitated sharing of intellectual property. Aim 3: The
Technology Training and Dissemination Core expands its success in the current grant cycle to offer robust
training and dissemination opportunities. In the training component, all Center workshops and seminars will be
presented in a hybrid onsite/remote mode, individualized training will be offered via proctored “how to” videos
on key topics and additional outreach initiatives will be implemented that are geared towards interactions with
other P41 Centers, internal WU training grants/programs and traditionally underserved universities. New
innovations in our dissemination efforts will increase the capabilities of our Service Projects for both pre-clinical
and human studies. The Administration Core will continue to provide the managerial oversight necessary for
the efficient operation of the PET-RTRC so that it meets its scientific, training and dissemination objectives.
Successful completion of the proposed renewal application will further propel the PET-RTRC as a national
resource to facilitate research that will increase our understanding of the molecular basis of disease, thus
providing the framework for novel diagnostic and therapeutic paradigms leading to improved human health."
10914198,"Administration Core Project Summary
During the current funding cycle the Administration Core has been fully operational fulfilling its organizational,
financial management, and communication functions, ensuring the PET Radiotracer Translation and Resource
Center (PET-RTRC) met its scientific, training, and dissemination goals. In this renewal application it will continue
to provide these services and has added innovations to further enhance Center performance. Key components
of the Core include:
1) Administrative Component: The administrative component coordinates the general activities of the PET-
 RTRC, including infrastructure and financial support to facilitate communication within the PET-RTRC located
 at WU, between the WU location and our various Collaborative Projects (CPs) and Service Projects (SPs)
 located around the country, and between the Center and NIBIB, as well as organize the PET-RTRC annual
meeting.
2) Provide biostatistical support for Center activities.
3) The Quantitative Imaging & Informatics Resource Quantitative Imaging & Informatics Resource (QI2R): In the
 renewal application, QI2R will expand operations and enhance the objectives with the goal to ensure timely
 and standardized evaluation of radiotracer performance, data management and to provide additional
 assistance to sites to establish their pre-clinical imaging capability.

recommendations that will be incorporated into the PET-RTRC’s Annual Progress Report provided to the
NIBIB program."
10813721,"Project Summary
Relapse represents a consistent clinical problem when treating individuals with Substance Use Disorder. To
study this, I will use the incubation of craving model to investigate the role of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens
(NAc) core subregion (NAcc) in the persistence of cue-induced cocaine craving in rats after protracted
abstinence. The procedure begins with extended access cocaine self-administration during which the rat learns
to associate a drug infusion with a light cue. This is followed by a period of forced abstinence during which the
rat is returned to their home cage and has no exposure to the drug or drug-paired cues. At different time-points
during this abstinence period, rats are returned to the operant boxes for cue-induced seeking tests, during which
responding on the nose-poke hole that previously delivered drug and cue now delivers only the cue. As the
duration of abstinence increases, responding under these conditions, our measure of cue-induced drug seeking
or craving, progressively intensifies or ‘incubates’. This model is translationally relevant because incubation of
craving also occurs in humans. The Wolf lab and others have demonstrated that incubation requires plasticity of
excitatory synaptic transmission in the NAcc allowing for a strengthening of these synapses. However, despite
the importance of dopaminergic signaling in the NAcc for motivated behavior, little is known about the role that
dopamine plays in the incubation of cocaine craving. I hypothesize that dopamine transients in the NAcc
associated with cue-induced drug seeking intensify during incubation and contribute to its expression. In Aim 1,
I will use fiber photometry paired with the dopamine biosensor GRAB_DA to measure dopamine responses
provoked by the drug paired cue during seeking tests in early abstinence, prior to incubation, and late abstinence,
after incubation has plateaued. In Aim 2, I will determine the functional significance of NAcc dopaminergic
transmission during incubation by injecting dopamine receptor antagonists into the NAcc before the drug seeking
test. I predict that blockade of either D1 dopamine receptors or D2 dopamine receptors will reduce cue-induced
cocaine seeking after incubation has occurred, and that this reduction will be less robust in early abstinence.
This project will address a current gap in the literature regarding dopamine’s role in the incubation of craving. In
addition to scientific advancement, this proposal offers me many opportunities to develop as a scientist. Learning
fiber photometry and the other approaches required for this project, and applying these approaches to an
established animal model of relapse, are key foundational technical skills that I can build upon during future
postdoctoral training. Other goals of this fellowship training are to improve my written and oral communication
skills by writing manuscripts and by attending conferences to present my work and network in the field of
neuroscience, to improve my ability to design rigorous experiments, and to gain more experience with mentoring
and supervising others. These skills will help me become a competitive post-doc candidate and will eventually
allow me to become an independent researcher either at the PI level or the staff scientist level."
10848243,"Project Summary: Impairments in visual processing and perceptual decision-making are a significant cause of
morbidity in neuropsychiatric disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease and schizophrenia. The primary goal of this
training proposal is to characterize a potentially novel node in the distributed network underlying visual perceptual
decision-making - the midbrain reticular nucleus (MRN). Classical models of perceptual decision-making ascribe
decision formation to forebrain sensorimotor regions, with the midbrain existing at the end of a feedforward
pathway to relay motor commands. However, there is substantial evidence that the midbrain, especially the
superior colliculus (SC), participates in the visual decision process. Additionally, our recent work has shown that
a variety of coding, from movements, to action selection, to even abstract cognitive representations such as cue
valuation, is simultaneously distributed in multiple regions throughout the brain. We hypothesize that this coding
scheme applies to visual decisions as well, with midbrain regions including MRN and SC participating in a
network with regions in the cortex and basal ganglia to form the decision.
 The MRN has traditionally been thought of as a purely motor-related region. Challenging this notion, we
recently found visual and action selection signals in MRN during a visual decision-making task. Questions remain
however regarding how the diverse coding in MRN is organized topographically, whether visual responses are
a result of task learning, the encoding of abstract decision signals in MRN, and how MRN interacts with the
broader perceptual decision-making circuitry. This training proposal addresses each of these questions by
leveraging the scale of Neuropixels 2.0 probes and a novel visual reverse contingency task I have designed and
implemented to distinguish sensory, motor, and decision signals. Aim 1A uses Neuropixels 2.0 recordings
across MRN in mice viewing a variety of stimuli to build a topographic map of sensory and motor coding, and
Aim 1B uses similar recordings in task-naive and trained mice passively perceiving task stimuli to assess visual
plasticity in MRN. Aim 2A uses recordings across MRN during task performance to establish the presence of
abstract decision signals, and Aim 2B uses multi-probe recordings throughout the visual decision network to
establish inter-area interactions during decision formation. Together these aims will advance our understanding
of the distributed regions and the complex computations that give rise to visual decision-making, thereby
improving our ability to precisely target key circuits in disorders where this process goes awry.
 During my tailored training period, I will learn Neuropixels electrophysiology, rodent behavioral task
design and implementation, whole-brain histological processing and imaging, and advanced computational
analysis techniques under the guidance of experts in a supportive training environment. These skills, combined
with clinical training in a world-leading medical institution, will ideally prepare me for an independent career as a
physician-scientist working to advance the understanding and treatment of neurological disorders."
10928748,"Recent studies have reported widespread transcription of mammalian enhancers into noncoding RNA
transcripts in a stimulus-dependent manner. Growing evidence shows that these enhancer RNAs (eRNAs)
have essential roles in orchestrating higher-order chromatin interactions to facilitate gene expression and
phenotypic outcomes during development and disease. As a result, eRNAs are emerging as an important
component of the gene regulatory machinery. Due to their very recent discovery, the expression and roles of
eRNAs in stroke is virtually unknown. Recently, we applied a combination of genome-wide RNA-seq and
genome-wide enhancer mapping using ChIP-seq to identify a number of stroke-induced eRNAs at multiple
time-points of reperfusion in the mouse cerebral cortex. Our preliminary data confirmed enhancer activity of the
genomic loci encoding the eRNAs, showed that the eRNAs are localized to the chromatin, and revealed an
important role for one such eRNA in modulating post-stroke brain damage and gene expression. The
molecular interactions, functional mechanisms and sex-dependent effects of eRNAs on the post-stroke
pathophysiology are unexplored. In the current project, we build upon our preliminary data to evaluate eRNA
functionality in-depth during stroke in the adult mouse cortex. Specific Aim 1 will use a combination of
crosslinking-immunoprecipitation, fluorescence in situ hybridization and transcriptional-state analysis to
determine the molecular targets of the eRNAs as a function of post-stroke reperfusion time in the mouse
cortex. Specific Aim 2 will employ eRNA loss-of-function in vivo followed by cellular, physiological, pathological
and neurological analyses to evaluate the role of the eRNA in propagating the post-stroke pathophysiology.
Specific Aim 3 will evaluate the molecular targets and pathophysiological effects of the eRNA in the female
mouse cortex. Together, this work will illuminate the significance of eRNAs in the cerebral cortex and may
reveal novel gene regulatory relationships in stroke. This work will pave the way for future studies exploring the
therapeutic manipulation of eRNAs to improve post-stroke outcomes."
10894619,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 RyR2 is an intracellular calcium (Ca) release channel expressed in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of
cardiomyocytes. In the normal heart, RyR2 Ca release from the SR is tightly regulated and only occurs during
systole to facilitate heart contraction. In heart disease, RyR2 Ca release can occur during diastole and is
considered pathologic. Pathologic Ca release can be caused by RyR2 mutations or RyR2 post-translational
modifications. Pathologic Ca release during diastole reduces cardiac contractility due to depletion of SR Ca
stores and is pro-arrhythmogenic due to delayed after-depolarizations resulting from sodium (Na) flux into the
cell via the Na-Ca exchanger. RyR2 mutations cause catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia
(CPVT), a genetic arrhythmia syndrome, while post-translational modifications have been widely documented
in congestive heart failure (CHF) caused by myocardial infarction. Both conditions are associated with a high
risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD). My mentor discovered that an old antiarrhythmic drug – flecainide –
prevents pathologic rather than physiologic Ca release and is strikingly effective in preventing ventricular
arrhythmias in CPVT patients. Importantly, he recently discovered that flecainide’s efficacy depends not on Na
channel block but rather RyR2 block. Unfortunately, due to its Na channel blocking properties, flecainide
increases mortality in patients with CHF and cannot be used in this patient population. To address these
patients’ risk for SCD – currently unmitigated by available drugs – I aim to develop a flecainide analogue that
maintains RyR2 block but not Na channel block. In doing so, I will investigate the mechanism of action of
flecainide and test the hypothesis that its efficacy depends on a change in the membrane potential across the
SR. My research background and the established use of patch clamp electrophysiology and calcium imaging in
my mentor’s lab will enable me to test flecainide analogues generated by our collaborators in synthetic
chemistry. To probe the mechanism of action underlying flecainide’s voltage-dependent RyR2 block, I will
employ a variety of tools including genetically encoded voltage indicators and voltage-sensitive dyes to capture
the theoretical membrane potential change that occurs at the SR. The results from this aim will not only clarify
flecainide’s mechanism of action but also yield a novel therapeutic principle – that voltage-dependent
block of RyR2 channels is a key feature for the development of future RyR2 inhibitors as
antiarrhythmic drugs."
10904777,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Local translation is a conserved molecular mechanism of concentrating proteins within distinct subcellular
compartments. In morphologically distinct cells like neurons, mRNAs must travel great distances to reach their
final destinations. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) bind target mRNAs and coordinate mRNA fates including
transport, anchoring, and translation. By binding target mRNAs, RBPs support a network of RNA-protein and
protein-protein interactions called the messenger ribonucleoprotein complex (mRNP). While there has been
significant work to investigate direct RNA-protein interactions, we do not know constituents of the mRNP that
may interact with RBPs to regulate them. For this proposal, we will investigate the zipcode binding protein 1
(ZBP1) and its target mRNA, -actin, to evaluate how phosphorylation of RBPs alters the protein and RNA
composition of the mRNP. We hypothesize that ZBP1 phosphorylation alters the β-actin mRNP composition,
thereby causing dynamic changes in transport, anchoring, and translation. We will investigate this hypothesis
using two distinct cell types: fibroblasts and neurons. First, we will test this hypothesis by combining proximity
biotinylation with the MS2 RNA labeling system to capture global changes in the -actin mRNP in response
ZBP1 phosphorylation in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. We will validate these findings using imaging techniques.
To understand the molecular effects of -actin mRNP composition, we will follow how the transport, anchoring,
and translation are affected by various ZBP1 phosphorylation mutants using a combination of single cell
microscopy and molecular biology techniques. With cultured hippocampal neurons, we will evaluate whether the
-actin mRNA motility and translation changes in response to introduced ZBP1 phosphorylation mutants. These
studies will be important for determining how assembly of the -actin mRNP is altered by ZBP1 phosphorylation
and identify the molecular consequences of this form of RBP regulation. This project will be completed under the
mentorship of Dr. Robert H. Singer at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, a leading expert in RNA biology and
single molecule microscopy. Under the advisement of Dr. Singer, Leti Nunez will receive a multi-disciplinary
training in molecular and cellular biology combined with expertise in state-of-the-art microscopy. During the
duration of this award, Leti will receive training to advance her career in academic medicine particularly relevant
to the cellular basis of disease. For example, ZBP1’s role in mRNA localization has been implicated in memory
and learning and tumor metastasis."

Obesity in childhood is a global epidemic with serious health and social consequences.1-4 The highest rates of
obesity are observed among racial/ethnic minority populations and those from economically disadvantaged
backgrounds.1 Rhode Island (RI) is particularly affected by the obesity epidemic; the prevalence of children
who meet criteria for overweight/obese (OW/OB) is 35% in RI as a whole and 40% in Greater Providence57.
The purpose of this mixed methodological study will be to use the Transcreation Framework56 to inform the
development of a behavioral intervention to improve diet quality and increase physical activity for adolescents
in Greater Providence, RI, an urban area with substantial racial/ethnic diversity. In Aim 1 we will conduct an
evaluation of epidemiological, social, and contextual factors related to overweight and obesity in adolescents to
inform a community needs assessment. In Aim 2, we will partner with stakeholders to identify community
assets and unmet needs and to evaluate components of existing evidenced-based lifestyle modification
programs (i.e., diet, physical activity, self-monitoring, goal setting and problem solving, social support). Results
from Aims 1 and 2 will inform Aim 3, in which we will design components of intervention prototype to improve
diet quality and increase physical activity in adolescents. The study will involve the creation of a panel of
adolescents (i.e., Young Voices Panel) whose members will be actively engaged as partners in each step of
the process (e.g., priority setting, data collection/analyses, intervention development). We will use purposeful
sampling to recruit 40 key stakeholders including adolescents from the community and their caregivers.
clinicians (doctors, nurses, dietitians from specialty clinics/pediatricians’ offices), administrators from
government organizations (e.g., RI Department of Health, Housing Agencies), and representatives from
community organizations (e.g., the Greater Providence YMCA, RI Food Bank; Schools, Progresso Latino) to
inform our community needs assessment and the development of our intervention. An overview of data
gathered in Aim 1 will be presented to the research team (i.e., Sponsor and Cosponsors and Young Voices
Panel) to guide the qualitative component of community needs assessment in Aim 2. Group Concept Mapping
will be used to identifying and reviewing existing scientific evidence to determine core components of
behavioral interventions that reflect mechanisms of action. Community Asset Mapping will be used to obtain
input from the community about barriers and facilitators to existing evidenced-based programs as well as
locally developed program and community resources. Aim 3 will involve the creation of intervention protocol
modules through an iterative process of discussions and content development with members of the YVP,
community stakeholders, and the academic research team. The current study will initiate the development of a
manualized intervention protocol to improve diet quality and increase physical activity for adolescents in
Providence, RI to be evaluated in a future project (i.e., K23 award)."
10873054,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a condition of aging, primarily afflicting adults 65 and older, and is the most
common cause of dementia worldwide. The histopathological hallmarks of AD are amyloid plaques and
neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), formed by aggregation of proteins amyloid-β and tau, respectively. Studies have
shown NFT formation is correlated with brain atrophy and cognitive decline. Therefore, halting tau aggregation
at early stages to prevent disease progression is a potential therapeutic avenue for AD. Previous studies in our
group determined the micro-electron diffraction structure of 305SVQIVY310, an aggregation-prone segment of
tau. We designed a peptide-based inhibitor to target its aggregating interfaces, referred to as WIW, which has
been demonstrated to halt tau aggregation in vitro and in cell models. To transport WIW across the blood-brain
barrier (BBB), I have linked WIW to a peptide tag that enters the brain via receptor-mediated endocytosis by
binding to low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1. In Aim 1, I will probe the mechanism of action of
WIW by solving a co-crystal structure of WIW with its target peptide, SVQIVY. In Aim 2, I will modify WIW to
optimize its CNS delivery and plasma stability. In Aim 3, I will determine whether WIW or an optimized analog
can inhibit tau aggregation in PS19 mice, a mouse model of tauopathy. Although WIW has been demonstrated
to halt tau aggregation in vitro and in cell models, these proposed investigations will be the first structural
characterization of the mechanism of action of WIW and the first characterization of its ability to halt tau
aggregation in vivo."
10709571,"In order to advance the development of tele-rehabilitation that addresses issues related to traumatic brain
injury (TBI), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and related issues, this project will deploy and test two
interventions designed to build strengths valuable for achieving personal goals such as in school and work.
The interventions will be based on two different lines of theory for improving goal-directed functioning,
targeting either goal-directed brain state regulation skills (GSR) or knowledge for optimizing brain
functioning (OPT). Both interventions will utilize advances in tele-rehabilitation (e.g., online resources,
digital apps, and coaching over tele-video) to provide access to guided learning experiences for Veterans in
different locations and settings. We will examine the impact of these interventions on multiple levels of
goal-directed functioning, and we will investigate changes in hypothesized neurocognitive pathways.
Post-9/11 Veterans with a history of TBI (age 25-60) will be allocated to one of the two training
interventions in a randomized, controlled design. Assessments will focus on indexing tiers of goal-directed
functioning (neurocognitive tests, functional performance with complex tasks, and goal attainment in
personal life) and will be collected for double-baseline, after training, and at 3 months follow-up.
The knowledge generated by this project will inform Veteran-centered intervention development, including
informing and providing tools for tele-rehabilitation that Veterans can access at home, in school, and other
settings remote from VA facilities."
10880690,"With the increase in life expectancy of people living with HIV (PLWH), principally due to the introduction of
antiretroviral therapy (ART), it has become evident that these individuals differentially acquire a wide range
of health problems, including oral health complications, which severely impact quality of life and incur
substantial healthcare costs. We previously identified an altered proteomic profile of human oral
keratinocytes isolated from PLWH patients, suggesting elevated cellular stress and reduced ability to
provide robust innate immune protection. We also demonstrated that these epithelial cells display altered
epigenetic markers, reduced proliferative capacity and respond weakly to microbial challenges.
We now hypothesize that in PLWH, oral epithelial cell dysfunction predisposes towards
susceptibility to secondary viral infections, such as HPV. We have assembled an interdisciplinary
team of experts whose expertise encompasses HIV and HPV virology, oral and epithelial cell biology,
epigenomics and bioinformatics. We propose to apply a novel non-invasive method of collecting oral
mucosal cells from PLWH and conduct genomic and epigenomic analyses of the oral epithelium (Aim 1).
Additionally, using a relevant HPV infection model, we wish to determine if such cells expanded from the
oral mucosa of PLWH, which we have demonstrated exhibit an altered proteome, are more susceptible to
HPV infection when compared to oral epithelial cells from healthy controls (Aim 2). These studies will be
the first to establish the transcriptomic and epigenomic effects of HIV infection on primary epithelial cells,
establish a new culture-based assay system so critical for future mechanistic and therapeutic studies, and
enable direct comparisons between these in vivo and in vitro methods to robustly identify key molecular
features that are central to the increased HPV susceptibility seen in PLWH.
Successful completion of the goals of this R21 will enable targeted hypothesis-based genomic or
epigenomic studies (i.e. shRNAs, CRISPR, or small molecules) to identify specific genes/pathways
mediating the HPV susceptibility, and functionally test HPV infection levels. Validating the epigenetic basis
of susceptibility to HPV infection in PLWH will eventually guide the discovery and application of novel
epigenomic-based clinical interventions; all consistent with the goals of the NOSI NOT-DE-21-019 “Basic
and translational oral health research related to HIV/AIDS.”"
10888237,"Project Summary
While modern therapy has enabled the more than 37 million people living with HIV to experience near normal
life expectancy and transformed it into a manageable chronic disease, neurocognitive impairment remains an
unresolved clinical concern. Increasing evidence indicates that chronic systemic immune activation contributes
to neuroinflammation, and neuroinflammation promotes the severity of neurodegenerative diseases.
Intriguingly, viral-induced neuroinflammation has striking similarities to neurodegenerative disease, and chronic
infection may increase the risk of developing neurodegenerative disease. One factor linked to
neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, and host immunity against microbial pathogens is the immune kinase
leucine rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2). LRRK2 has been implicated in modulating antiviral cytokine activity,
conferring susceptibility to mycobacterial infection, and mutated LRRK2 is the most common monogenetic
cause of the neurodegenerative disorder Parkinson’s disease. The long-term objectives of this proposal are to
extend the observation that LRRK2 modulates antiviral immunity during bacterial infection to determine the
function of LRRK2 in viral pathogenesis and neuroinflammation and assess its therapeutic potential. Using a
macaque SIV infection model for HIV, this proposal seeks to address the fundamental questions of whether
SIV infection promotes LRRK2 expression, and how loss of LRRK2 impacts SIV pathogenesis and the host
immune response. We hypothesize that LRRK2 contributes to HIV pathogenesis through regulation of antiviral
immunity. To test this, we will use a non-human primate (NHP) model to assess the impact of SIV infection on
LRRK2 gene expression and protein levels longitudinally in circulating immune populations and gastrointestinal
tract, and at a single time point in the brain as LRRK2 is dynamically expressed in these tissues. Next, we will
assess the impact of LRRK2 inhibition on host response to SIV using both in vivo and ex vivo approaches. The
data obtained by this project will shed light on the function of LRRK2 in antiviral immune activation and
generate preliminary data for future studies investigating factors contributing to viral-induced
neuroinflammation. The proposed study and Mentored Career Development Plan will be conducted at Tulane
National Primate Center (TNPRC) under the guidance of Drs. Tracy Fisher and Ronald Veazey, experts in viral
induced neuroinflammation and SIV pathogenesis. The TNPRC is a national resource for NHP biomedical
research with a long history of research excellence in viral pathogenesis and therapeutic intervention. The
TNPRC has a strong commitment to training and mentorship demonstrated by extensive financial, effort-
based, and programmatic support to cultivate a rich and diverse training environment for early-stage
investigators. The mentored support and dedicated time provided by the K01 will further Dr. Vail’s career goals
of becoming an independent investigator and NHP researcher studying host pathogen interactions."

The overall goals of this PPG are to define the mechanisms that lead to increased incidence of hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) with age and to leverage this understanding to develop and validate candidate approaches for
enhanced early detection and prevention. To achieve these Goals requires an interdisciplinary team of experts,
specializing in different molecular and cellular aspects of both cancer and aging biology, innovative mouse
models and experimental tools, and Core facilities to maximize efficiencies and promote synergies. In turn, this
multi-pronged team requires an Administrative Core to support and orchestrate its activities.
Profs. Peter D. Adams (Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute (SBP), La Jolla) and Gerald S.
Shadel (Salk Institute, La Jolla) will serve as multiple PD/PIs, with Adams serving as the Contact PI. Shadel will
lead Project 1 and Adams Project 2. Other Project Leads are Prof. Susan Kaech (Salk Institute, La Jolla; Project
3) and Prof. Gen-Sheng Feng (University of California, San Diego (UCSD); Project 4). The P01 also incorporates
three Cores, an Administrative Core A (Leads Shadel and Adams), a Mouse models of aging and cancer Core
B (Lead Dr. Alessandra Sacco, SBP) and an Integrated bioinformatics of aging and cancer Core C (Lead Dr.
Maxim Shokhirev, Salk Institute). Kaech, Feng, Sacco and Shokhirev are all very accomplished scientists and
highly qualified to lead their components and to contribute to overall leadership of the PPG. This 6-member

offering the following services: (1) Mouse husbandry, collecting tail-snips for genotyping, and longitudinal
monitoring of key parameters (body weight, average food intake, tumor measurements); (2) Animal interventions,
which include injections (intravenous (IV), retroorbital or tail vein, hydrodynamic tail vein injection (HDTV),
intraperitoneal (IP)), viral and DNA delivery, agents delivery (oral gavage, modified diet or water, or injections),
cell transplantation; (3) Efficient use of infrastructure and access to equipment for animal imaging to monitor
tumor growth; (4) Animal health monitoring using the standard industry-wide practice of soiled bedding sentinels
for quarterly viral detection and annual microbiology and histopathology testing; (5) Collection and storage of
tissues for histological and molecular analyses; (6) Histopathology expertise to assess liver tissues for stage of
disease; (7) A mouse colony database and a tissue banking database accessible to PPG investigators, in
collaboration with Core A; (8) Hands-on training in animal handling and procedural techniques for project staff.
Core B will benefit from personnel with long-term expertise in animal work. Performance of procedures by skilled
Core staff will enhance the reproducibility and scientific quality of the data, as well as minimizing pain and stress
for the animals. Core B will participate in all project planning sessions with the Administrative Core (Core A) and
PPG investigators to ensure that Core B is functioning to meet programmatic needs. Core B will be responsible
for reporting to the Administrative Core, documenting effort and evaluating Core contributions to individual

10908394,"PROJECT SUMMARY – CORE C
Understanding aging in the liver and the role of aging in liver cancer development will require the collection, QC,
analysis, and integration of a large collection of high-throughput datasets. The Integrative Aging and Cancer
Bioinformatics Core, Core C, will achieve this goal by offering three key services for PPG members.
The first key service will establish the infrastructure needed for day-to-day activities. This will include the hiring
and training of two dedicated PhD-level bioinformatics analysts that will work closely with PPG members on all
aspects of their projects from data curation and analysis to custom tool and pipeline implementation, data
presentation, and scientific writing. In addition to key personnel, the core will also obtain the hardware needed
to store data and bioinformatic pipelines required to answer specific questions. The final aspect of this service is
to work with Core A to communicate and make available data and analyses to PPG members.
The second key service will be to perform state-of-the-art focused analyses on PPG member data which will
include performing data quality control, generation of cleaned quantified datasets, identifying features that are
changing, such as genes or pathways central to liver aging and tumor development, and compiling the analyses
into visual presentations that can be disseminated and shared with PPG members. An important part of this
second key service will be to educate and train PPG members on the interpretation and limitations of the
analyses and to provide access to shared servers and educational resources and trainings that would enable
PPG members and trainees to perform some of their own analyses and become more intimately acquainted with
their data.
The final crucial service will be the integration of these datasets into a holistic view of aging and tumor
development in the liver. This will include integrating gene expression, protein expression, and metabolite
abundance measures using network-based and statistical approaches with the goal of identifying molecular
mechanisms changing with age. Also, single-cell assays will be combined to reveal not only changes in gene
expression, but also spatial organization, T-cell receptor diversity, and chromatin accessibility of individual cells
in livers. Finally, machine learning approaches will be used to combine datasets into predictive models of tumor
formation and possible effects of preventative interventions on tumor formation."

Mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress and inflammation are hallmarks of aging and cancer, but crosstalk
between these processes are not well understood. Mitochondria are complex and dynamic organelles at the
nexus of cellular energy metabolism, redox balance, and critical signaling pathways that regulate both cell
physiology and cell death. In cancer cells, mitochondria are remodeled in many ways to promote metabolic states
that support cell proliferation and prevent cell death. This is accompanied by changes in cellular redox status
due to increased reactive oxygen species production that can promote oxidative stress and genomic instability
(of both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, mtDNA). Similarly, reduced mitochondrial respiratory capacity,
increased ROS production, and genomic instability are hallmarks of the normal aging process. Since aging is a
major risk factor for most adult cancers, the major premise of Project 1 of the program is that age-related changes
in mitochondrial dynamics, function and signaling underlie cancer susceptibility with aging. Furthermore, based
on our preliminary and published results, we propose that, in addition to the mitochondrial changes indicated
above, mtDNA-mediated inflammatory pathways are a key feature of aging and age-related cancer initiation. We
also hypothesize that a novel form of adaptive cellular signaling, called “oxidative mitohormesis,” will prevent or
delay age-related liver dysfunction and cancer initiation. Project 1 has three specific aims. Aim 1 is to determine
the role of age-related mitochondrial dysfunction in mtDNA-mediated inflammatory signaling and its contribution
to liver cancer. Aim 2 is to determine the contribution of the mtDNA-cGAS-Sting pathway to liver aging and age-
dependent liver cancer susceptibility. And, Aim 3 is to test oxidative mitohormesis as an intervention for liver
aging and liver cancer. To accomplish these aims we will use a combination of innovative mouse models in
which we can generate specific gene knock-outs or initiate liver cancer at different ages. In addition, we can
induce mitohormetic responses by inducible and reversible knock-down of the mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme,
SOD2 (iSOD2 mice). Finally, as part of common effort by all four labs in the program, who have different, but
complimentary expertise and hypotheses about the role of inflammation in aging and cancer, we will assess a
multitude of phenotypes (gene expression, chromatin remodeling, immune cell infiltration and activity,
inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolism) in normal aging liver and in an age-dependent Pten
knock-out model of liver cancer. Project 1 will contribute expertise in mitochondria, mtDNA-mediated
inflammation, and adaptive mitochondrial stress signaling to this concerted effort to understand the age-
dependence of liver cancer. Key findings will be translated into normal and NALFD liver samples from humans
of different ages."
10908396,"PROJECT SUMMARY – PROJECT 2
The incidences of liver cancer (primarily hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)) are increasing and disease outcome
is poor. Consequently, there is an urgent need for new therapies and preventive strategies. Age is a major risk
for HCC and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD is a chronic liver disease that encompasses a
progressive range of disorders of increasing severity and risk of HCC, from benign fatty liver (steatosis), to
inflammatory non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis and cirrhosis. Aging is accompanied by many
molecular, cellular and tissue changes that are candidate drivers of NAFLD and HCC, including the “hallmarks
of aging” that are dysregulated with age in diverse tissues and organisms; for example, changes to mitochondria,
metabolism, the epigenome, accumulation of senescent cells, inflammation and immune changes.
 Cell senescence is caused by a range of cellular stresses and characterized by an irreversible
proliferation arrest and a potent pro-inflammatory phenotype, the senescence-associated secretory phenotype
(SASP). Recently, we showed that in senescent cells, mitochondria dysfunction signals to evict fragments of
chromatin from the nucleus into the cytoplasm (cytoplasmic chromatin fragments (CCF)) via a nucleus-to-
cytoplasmic blebbing process. CCF are sensed by the anti-viral cytoplasmic DNA sensing apparatus to activate
NFkB and the SASP. The SASP of senescent cells includes interferons, a family of cytokines involved in cell
intrinsic anti-viral mechanisms, control of cell proliferation, inflammation and adaptive immunity, and tumor
suppressive and oncogenic processes. Although SASP and acute IFN signaling have important benefits, chronic
SASP and IFN signaling can be detrimental. As a source of chronic inflammation, SASP promotes tissue aging
and disease, including liver cancer. Chronic IFN signaling can promote immunosuppression, in part by
upregulation of immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as PD-L1.
 Based on unpublished data, we hypothesize that accumulation of CCF in aged and/or senescent liver
hepatocytes drives chronic activation of IFN signaling, expression of IFN target genes and immune checkpoint
inhibitors, such as PD-L1. We further hypothesize that this, in turn, generates an immunosuppressed liver
microenvironment that is permissive for transformation of old hepatocytes. By antagonizing this
immunosuppressive signaling pathway, we hypothesize that several different types of intervention can prevent
liver cancer during aging. Completion of these Specific Aims will promote novel interventions to prevent HCC."
10908397,"PROJECT SUMMARY – PROJECT 3
Liver cancer is a leading cause of cancer related deaths world-wide (1,2). Age is a crucial risk for acquiring
cancer as people older than 60 are more likely to develop primary liver cancer (3). A key aspect of the aging
process is the development of chronic inflammation that inhibits the homeostatic liver functions, thereby
contributing to tumor growth (4,5). Specifically, we advocate that during aging, chronic interferon (IFN) signaling
leads to upregulation of immune checkpoints in both hepatocytes and immune cells that suppress anti-tumor
immune responses. Besides upregulating immune checkpoints, chronic IFN signaling also induces various
metabolic disruptions that could act together to inhibit anti-tumor immune responses. Bile acids (BAs) are
important metabolites to consider in this regard, because the accumulation of BAs within the liver is an important
risk factor that could contribute to liver tumor initiation and progression (6,7). While liver cancers are often
infiltrated by T cells, surprisingly, this type of tumor is fairly unresponsive to immune-checkpoint blockade and
adoptive T cell therapy (8,9). Our preliminary analysis shows that BAs accumulate with age, and we hypothesize
that such excessive amount of BAs could cause suppression of infiltrating T cells and T cell directed
immunotherapies to combat liver cancer. A direct inhibitory role for BA signaling on T-cell function, especially in
the context of anti-tumor immunity, has not been well-investigated to date. Thus, we plan to study novel ways by
which persistent BA signaling influences T cell suppression within tumors, notably dissecting such suppressive
mechanisms in the context of aging as it relates to tumor progression. Metabolites such as BAs that build-up in
the liver during aging can act together with other inhibitory molecules, for example IFN-directed immune
checkpoints like PD-L1, to promote T cell dysfunction. This project at the interface of aging and cancer has great
potential to provide new and efficient ways to rejuvenate CD8+ T cell mediated immunity, thereby providing novel
avenues to prevent and treat aggressive cancers including colon, esophageal and pancreatic cancers for which
BAs can accumulate and contribute to disease pathogenesis (10). Moreover, this Project will leverage the
expertise of Dr. Feng (Project 4) for BA-signaling and liver cancer mouse models, Dr. Shadel (Project 1) for
metabolic and mitochondrial function and mechanisms of IFN-signaling and aging, and Dr. Adams (Project 2)
for mouse models of aging and age-related changes in gene expression, Dr. Sacco (Core B) for all major mouse
models and common interventions, and Dr. Shokhirev (Core C) for bioinformatic and systems-level analyses of
age related changes in the liver and tumor progression."
10908398,"PROJECT SUMMARY – PROJECT 4
Primary liver cancer, mainly hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), is now one of the most deadly malignant diseases.
Aging is a high-risk factor for HCC development, although the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood.
The aging liver is characterized by progressive development of an immunosuppressive microenvironment,
contributed by chronic interferon (IFN) signaling, metabolic changes and altered innate and adaptive immunity.
Thus, liver tumors are poorly responsive to immunotherapy. The goal of project 4 is to elucidate the roles of IFN
and other inflammatory cytokines in aging-related changes of the hepatic immunological landscape. This project
was prompted by our unexpected finding in most recent experiments. In dissecting molecular mechanisms of
liver tumorigenesis with an inducible gene targeting system, Mx1-cre, we identified a robust tumor-inhibitory
effect of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (polyIC), a synthetic dsRNA that induces IFN expression. These data on
IFN signaling not only challenge a widely known theory of IL1a-IL6 cytokine circuit in liver tumorigenesis, but
also open up new strategies for HCC immunotherapy. However, preliminary data also showed that injecting
polyIC into aged mice triggered sharply different immune responses and actually aggravated HCC progression
if given at late tumor stages. Thus, we hypothesize that IFN and other related inflammatory cytokines have
bidirectional or paradoxical roles in HCC development, depending on ages and tumor stages. To test this
hypothesis, we will extensively interrogate the roles of IFN signaling in a NASH-HCC model at single cell
resolution. We will also further develop and optimize a math model and a TI (tumorigenic index) calculation
system to quantitatively measure tumorigenic signal strength, tumor stages and prognosis, and also evaluate
tumor-inhibitory effects of various manipulation or treatment strategies. Of note, preliminary data also showed
robust induction of PD-L1 expression by polyIC in the liver, which prompted us to test a combination of polyIC
and PD-L1/PD-1 blockade in treatment of liver cancer in young and old mice. We shall extensively investigate
how coordinated activation of innate and adaptive immune functions can effectively suppress primary and
metastatic tumor progression in the liver. Finally, we shall take advantage of newly established mouse tumor
models, to systematically search for liver-specific factors and mechanisms of resistance to immunotherapy. All
of the proposed experiments in this ambitious project can only be done in collaboration with Shadel, Adams and
Kaech with complementary expertise and the Cores."

Specific Aims of this Project are to: 1) Evaluate the impact of MT characteristics and trajectories of midlife health indicators on preservation of cognitive function (avoiding cognitive decline and onset of mild cognitive impairment), sleep health, genitourinary and sexual function, and ability for independent living in early old age; 2) Evaluate the impact of MT characteristics and trajectories of health indicators on the preservation of psychological well-being and HRQL in early old age; 3) Determine the extent to which racial/ethnic health disparities in functioning and well-being in early old age are attributable to racial/ethnic differences in MT characteristics and midlife health trajectories; and 4) Translate for women and their health care providers findings regarding the relation of the MT/midlife health to cognition, functioning and well-being in early-old age. Integrating across Projects, we will examine associations of cognitive, physical and psychosocial functioning with cardiovascular health and mortality (Project 2) and with musculoskeletal health and falls (Project 3).

Imaging is essential for the study of developmental biology. In particular, optical imaging, with its high resolution,
has been making revolutionary impacts on our understanding of biological development. To a large degree, the
imaging capability defines what can be studied in developmental biology. From 2D to 3D, from static to dynamic,
advancements in optical imaging have enabled us to connect molecular genetics with volumetric morphogenesis
and have marked an exciting era of studying the underlying mechanisms in the context of dynamic developmental
process. Biological development is fascinating. From a single cell to a multi-billion cell system, cells with virtually
identical genes acquire different fates and are able to exhibit diverse behaviors and functions. To elucidate this
complex process, to dissect the mechanistic link between genotypes and phenotypes, and to define the roles of
biophysical, biochemical and biomechanical factors in the organismal growth and physiology, multi-contrast
imaging, capable of probing and bridging a wide range of biological information, is imperative and holds the
promise for the next revolution in the study of developmental biology. Understanding of development requires
different model systems, each with advantages in pursuit of specific questions. Among these, the mouse is the
premier mammalian model with well-established genetic tools for mutagenesis strategies and modeling of human
diseases. Studies on mice can produce insights that are highly relevant to human; however, many important
developmental questions cannot currently be studied using the mouse model, largely because it is difficult or
impossible to image the required information. This lack of proper imaging approach acts as a critical hurdle,
especially for live studies of the developing cells, tissues and organs, which are essential for a comprehensive
understanding of development. The goal of this research program is to establish a multi-contrast, high-resolution
dynamic imaging platform to advance live developmental biology, especially in the mouse model. Our technical
innovations are based on optical coherence tomography (OCT), a high-speed imaging modality with micro-scale
resolution and millimeter-level depth. Recently, we demonstrated live 4D (3D+time) structural and functional
OCT imaging of mouse embryos at a variety of time scales, revealing unprecedented mammalian developmental
dynamics. Building on this, we will pursue three projects to pioneer 3D-registered and integrated structural,
functional, molecular and biomechanical contrasts for live and dynamic studies of mammalian development. This
research program will generate a new frontier in the study of developmental biology and will make a major step
forward in understanding of mammalian development."

The chronic presence of elevations in fatigue suggests that individuals with post-COVID-19 fatigue (PCF) may
be at risk for experiencing increased fatigability when engaging in physical activity. An individual’s level of
fatigability is determined by the interactions between objective declines in performance (performance
fatigability) and perceptual changes regulating activity performance (i.e., perceived fatigability). Skeletal
muscle alterations including reduced force capacity, fiber atrophy, and metabolic dysfunction have been
observed in patients following SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, depression and anxiety have been identified
as common pre-existing conditions in patients with PCF. Thus, psychological as well as physiological
consequences of SARS-CoV-2 may provide insight into co-occurring mechanisms by which increased
fatigability occurs and persists following SARS-CoV-2 infection. While there have been widespread calls for the
implementation of rehabilitation for individuals recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infection, relatively little is
known about the potential benefits of physical exercise in this population. Home-based exercise programs
maybe particularly advantageous due to its ability to provide an exercise option to combat sedentary behavior
imposed by lockdowns, quarantines, and restrictions on community activity caused by the COVID-19
pandemic. To date, the safety and feasibility of home-based exercise has yet to be thoroughly investigated in
people previously infected by SARS-CoV-2. The overall goal of this project is to advance our understanding of
underlying mechanisms impacting performance fatigability and perceived fatigability in Veterans with PCF and
explore the safety and feasibility of a home-based “minimal-dose” resistance exercise program in this
population. The central hypothesis is that declines in force capacity, skeletal muscle oxygen extraction, and
affective responses to physical activity offer potential mechanisms through which fatigability is increased in
Veterans with PCF. Moreover, home-based resistance exercise delivered remotely may provide a safe and
feasible treatment option for this population. To address this hypothesis, the following aims are proposed: Aim
1: Compare fatigability, and the underlying neuromuscular and neurobiological factors, in Veterans with post-
COVID-19 fatigue to Veterans previously infected by SARS-CoV-2 without fatigue. Hypothesis 1a. Veterans
with post-COVID-19 fatigue will exhibit greater performance fatigability and perceived fatigability compared to
Veterans previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 not reporting post-COVID-19 fatigue. Hypothesis 1b. Veterans
with post-COVID-19 fatigue will exhibit reductions in knee extensor force capacity, muscle oxygen extraction,
and affective valence compared to Veterans previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 not reporting post-COVID-19
fatigue. Aim 2: Determine the safety and feasibility of an 8-week home-based “minimal-dose” resistance
exercise program for Veterans with post-COVID-19 fatigue. Hypothesis 2a. 8 weeks of home-based minimal-
dose resistance exercise will be safe and feasible in Veterans with post-COVID-19 fatigue. To test aim 2, we will
use a randomized controlled feasibility trial. Skeletal muscle force will be assessed during isometric and
dynamic knee extensor contractions using dynamometry and muscle oxygen extraction of the vastus lateralis
will be estimated using near-infrared spectroscopy. Affective responses will be measured using the Feeling
Scale. Secondary measures include motor unit properties, functional outcomes, and health-related quality of
life."

 PROJECT 1: EMERGING ADULT STUDY
Emerging adults have the highest prevalence of cannabis use and CUD of any age group. Despite high rates of
use and CUD, treatment seeking is relatively uncommon among emerging adults. Those who use cannabis are
less confident in their ability to abstain and show higher rates of ambivalence regarding the goal of abstinence
than those who use other drugs. Thus, emerging adult cannabis users may be more receptive to non-abstinence
or harm reduction approaches. The overarching aim of this proposal is to assess the effects of hemp-derived
CBD in emerging adults on harms associated with cannabis use including subjective intoxication, affect and
mood, psychotic experiences, and cognitive functioning, as well as to examine whether CBD supplementation
reduces self-administration of THC and symptoms of CUD. We propose a study design with high external validity
and experimental controls to study the harm-reducing effect of hemp-derived CBD in non-treatment-seeking
emerging adult who use cannabis regularly. The study will use our novel naturalistic cannabis administration
approach, which examines ecologically valid cannabis use utilizing a mobile lab setting to assess the effects of
the cannabis products the participants regularly use. We will recruit a sample of emerging adults, half of whom
primarily use flower products and half of whom primarily use concentrate products. Individuals will be randomly
assigned to hemp-derived CBD or placebo, consistent with our preliminary studies that have approved US Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) Investigation New Drug (IND 153535 and 157515). The aims are:
Aim 1: Test whether assignment to hemp-derived CBD, relative to placebo, over 8 weeks is associated with a)
reduced self-administration of THC, b) a reduction in CUD symptoms, c) lower levels of anxiety, depression, d)
better cognitive function, and e) higher anandamide (AEA) levels.
Aim 2: Test whether assignment to hemp-derived CBD, relative to placebo, reduces acute effects of cannabis
administration on: a) subjective drug effects, b) cognitive function, and c) mood and psychotic symptoms.
Aim 3: Test whether cannabis product type (flower vs. concentrates) moderates the association between CBD
assignment and a) cannabis use, b) mood and anxiety, and c) cognitive functioning in both longer-term (aim 1)

 PROJECT 2: ADULT STUDY
As cannabis legalization continues to spread across the United States, average Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)
concentrations in recreational products have significantly increased, with levels as high as 90-95% in
concentrated preparations. Our preliminary data suggest that concentrate use elicits blood THC levels more than
twice as high as cannabis flower use, and that concentrate use is associated with greater tolerance and loss of
control over cannabis use, prompting concern about the risks of these products. Several previous studies have
found that the non-intoxicating cannabinoid cannabidiol (CBD), which may antagonize the effects of THC on CB1
and CB2 receptors, reduces cannabis use, subjective response to THC, and craving. Pilot data from our lab also
suggest that CBD reduces THC effects, drug reward, anxiety, and overall THC use, suggesting that CBD may
mitigate the harms of high-THC products. However, the therapeutic dose of CBD necessary to achieve these
effects is unknown.
The overarching aim of this proposal is to combine our naturalistic cannabis administration paradigm
with a placebo-controlled, dose-ranging RCT of plant-derived CBD to evaluate CBD effects on cannabis
concentrate use, subjective effects, and cannabis cue reactivity. We will recruit 120 frequent concentrate
users to complete a four-week protocol during which they will complete two sessions in our mobile pharmacology
lab. In each session, participants will use their typical cannabis concentrate on an ad libitum basis. Amount of
THC self-administration during these sessions will be quantified by THC blood levels, obtained in the mobile lab
immediately before and after use. Subjective drug effects and exogenous and endogenous cannabinoid
biomarkers will also be quantified before and after THC use. Immediately after the first mobile lab session,
participants will be randomly assigned to take either 200 mg or 400 mg of plant-derived, broad spectrum CBD
or matched placebo (40 participants per group) daily for four weeks. Participants will return after two weeks to
provide a blood sample that will be analyzed for the THC metabolite 11-nor-9-carboxy-Δ9-THC (THC-COOH) to
detect recent cannabis use and for CBD levels to detect medication adherence. At this session, participants will
also complete a cannabis cue reactivity paradigm. Participants will complete a second mobile lab session after
four weeks of study medication ingestion."

 PROJECT 3: OLDER ADULT STUDY
Recent epidemiological data indicates a 10-fold increase in cannabis use among older adults (65+
years). Given this rise in use, an important public health question is how cannabis use might impact physical
and cognitive health in older individuals, especially since they are at increased risk of mild cognitive impairment
(MCI) and Alzheimer’s dementia (AD). This is additionally important with the rapidly aging population in the
U.S., the prevalence of MCI and AD, and the enormous mortality, morbidity, and socioeconomic costs of
associated with age-related cognitive decline. There is compelling evidence that older adults use cannabis to
treat chronic pain, sleep problems, and anxiety, and it is possible that cannabis use may decrease the
“polypharmacy” effect often associated with aging. In addition, animal studies suggest that cannabidiol (CBD)
and low doses of ∆9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) may be neuroprotective, reverse cognitive decline, and be
associated with lower levels of neurodegeneration in subcortical areas. Conversely, high doses of THC may be
harmful, with acute deleterious effects on cognition and motor control (e.g., risk of falling).
Key biological mechanisms that may help explain how cannabinoids differentially affect outcomes are age-
associated changes in inflammation and in the endocannabinoid system (ECS). Research shows that cannabis
(specifically CBD) has anti-inflammatory properties, and inflammation is in turn positively associated with sleep
problems, anxiety, and pain. Similarly, there are links between CBD and THC and particular endocannabinoids
(i.e., arachidonoyl ethanolamide [anandamide, AEA] and 2-arachidonoylglycerol [2-AG]), which are
differentially related to sleep, anxiety and pain. A mechanistic exploration of inflammatory biomarkers and
endocannabinoids could help elucidate the mechanisms of action of THC and CBD in older adults and
potentially more broadly.
The main goal of this project is to investigate these mechanisms and outcomes by randomly assigning
older adults interested in cannabis use to either hemp-derived CBD/+THC, CBD/-THC, or placebo
in an 8 week randomized controlled trial. This design will determine 1) impacts of THC and CBD on
inflammatory and endocannabinoid biomarkers and 2) if these mechanistic changes are associated
with the impact of cannabis on anxiety, sleep, and pain, and 3) the harm to benefit ratio in terms of
acute (impaired balance, impaired cognition) and longer term (polypharmacy, sleep, pain) outcomes."
10929961,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In persons living with dementia (PLWD), an Emergency Department (ED) visit is a critical event and an
opportunity to address the unmet needs that preceded the visit. Our multiple PI (mPI) team have together
conducted cluster-randomized, multi-site trials in >50 EDs as well as multiple hospice and home health
agencies, and are uniquely poised to address previous shortcomings in the development of scalable models of
care for PLWD. Through this work, and that of our co-investigators, we have developed and tested three
interventions relevant to PLWD and their care partners who visit the ED: 1) emergency care redesign
(UH3AT009844) of new and intentional workflows for emergency providers reinforced by digital alerts and
structured collaboration between sites, already shown to increase identification of advance care plans and
enlisted multidisciplinary support; 2) a nurse-led telephonic care program (PCORI) that increased advance
care planning and connected patients to hospice; and 3) a community paramedic-led structured coaching
intervention (R01AG050504) that reduced the odds of an ED revisit within 30 days by 75%. Building on this
evidence, the overarching goal of EDs LEading the Transformation of Alzheimer’s and Dementia Care (ED-
LEAD) is to turn an ED visit from a crisis into an opportunity to improve the well-being of PLWD and their care
partners. ED-LEAD will be embedded in a diverse group of 14 health systems, including 80 EDs with
substantial racial and ethnic diversity, with the ED as the unit of randomization. An Administrative Core will
oversee completion of all administrative milestones including integrating expertise and guidance from two NIA-
funded networks and an External Advisory Board. An Implementation Core will: 1) harmonize core functions
and processes; 2) optimize clinical decision support; and 3) and enable intervention fidelity across the three
interventions. Finally, a Statistical Analysis Core will provide biostatistical and data management support. Our
specific aims are to: 1) optimize a concurrently run emergency care redesign, nurse-led telephonic care, and
community paramedic-led transitions intervention in PLWD for feasibility, fidelity and usability in two EDs; 2)
study the effectiveness of these three interventions, alone and in combination, for PLWD with serious illness in
a cluster-randomized multifactorial trial embedded within 80 EDs on: ED revisits, hospitalizations, and healthy
days at home following the index ED visit; and 3) determine site, provider, patient, and care partner-level
characteristics within a diverse population associated with variation in implementation of each intervention. ED-
LEAD will address shortcomings noted in the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine
report on PLWD by providing high-quality, real-world evidence that may improve the lives and reduce suffering
of PLWD and their care partners. It will address key strategic goals of NIA and the National Alzheimer’s Plan to
“implement and evaluate new care models to support effective care transitions”, and provide health systems
with the necessary evidence to scale interventions for this vulnerable population."
10929962,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall objective of Emergency Departments LEading the transformation of Alzheimer’s and Dementia
care (ED-LEAD) is to optimize and study a suite of care interventions (emergency care redesign, nurse-led
telephonic case management, and community paramedic-led transitions intervention) both alone and in
combination, in a pragmatic, multifactorial trial embedded in 80 Emergency Departments (EDs). The overall
goal is to decrease emergency department use and hospitalizations, and increase days at home for persons
living with dementia (PLWD) and for their care partners (collectively known as dyads), who visit the ED. The
primary roles of the Administrative Core are to: 1) ensure efficient and effective communication between
interventions, cores, and ED sites; 2) coordinate support and guidance from external partners; and 3)
disseminate products and findings of this work. In particular, the Administrative Core leadership will mobilize
expertise from two NIA-funded dementia research networks in emergency medicine and pragmatic trials, and
convene an External Advisory Board comprising organizational stakeholders, a Lived Experience Panel made
up of PLWD and care partners, and a Lived Practice Panel comprising different disciplines engaged in
intervention experience. All three groups will provide insights critical to the success of ED-LEAD. The
Administrative Core will be led by a Steering Committee comprising the Executive Director, the multiple PI
(mPI) team (Chodosh, Brody, Shah, and Grudzen), Statistical Core Lead (Goldfeld), Lead Informatician
(Mann), and NIA project scientists. These seasoned collaborators will be supported by a rich research
infrastructure and personnel with expertise in launching complex interventions across multiple settings in older
adults with serious illness. NYU Grossman School of Medicine, NYU Rory Meyers College of Nursing,
University of Wisconsin–Madison School of Medicine and Public Health, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer
Center, and the mPI team have substantial expertise in tailoring the electronic health record (EHR) to promote
EHR interoperability and using single IRB review to increase efficiency of multi-site embedded pragmatic trials.
As a first step to ensuring effective and efficient functioning across the three interventions, the Administrative
Core will classify and catalogue intervention core functions and clinical decision support processes into forms
for ongoing reference and to preserve knowledge for future use. Besides financial management, the
Administrative Core will recruit, engage, guide, and support the External Advisory Board, and the Lived
Experience Panel and the Lived Practice Panel. The Administrative Core will integrate expertise from NIA-
funded dementia research networks, all in close coordination with the Implementation Core, and direct all
processes to support a strong communication plan. This includes developing and maintaining an accessible
and robust website and using various forums to disseminate knowledge."
10892918,"Project Summary/Abstract
Sepsis is a global epidemic with a high patient morbidity and mortality, and it accounts for staggering
healthcare costs both within the US and worldwide. Clinicians caring for septic patients are unable to
distinguish between septic patients who will rapidly recover and those patients who will develop a prolonged
disease course marked by immune dysfunction, infectious complications, chronic critical illness (CCI) and
death. This affects their ability to weigh the clinical risks versus benefits of immune-adjuvant therapy, in cases
where sepsis is characterized by marked immune paralysis. The long-term research goals are (1) to develop
novel, rapid and personalized tools with which to predict the prognostic trajectory of septic patients based on
underlying immune phenotype, and (2) to integrate this information into the clinical care of septic patients. The
subject of this proposal encompasses the first of these two goals, with objectives aligning with the NIGMS
Sepsis Research priorities (NOT-GM-19-054). Specifically, we will continue recruitment into an ongoing,
prospective, observational, clinical research trial enrolling patients suffering from acute sepsis at a tertiary care,
academic medical center. We will utilize a combination of immune-based assays and computational
approaches to (i) Validate the prognostic value of rapid, microfluidic cytokine analysis, following ex vivo
stimulation of whole blood. Hypothesis: functional immune phenotyping can identify septic patients with
subclinical immune paralysis who are prone to secondary infections. Approach: Quantitative analyses
comparing cytokine responses to immune adjuvants before and after ex vivo stimulation of whole blood.
Microfluidic cytokine analysis provides rapid and precise measurements and that are compatible with a clinical,
point of care test. (ii) Compare the CCI syndrome following medical and surgical sepsis. Hypothesis: Iatrogenic
tissue damage and inflammation caused by surgery alters the immune response and pathophysiology of CCI in
surgical patients, as compared with medical patients. We will use a combination of transcriptomic and
metabolomic data to confirm current theories of CCI pathophysiology in surgical patients, and then explore how
it differs in patients having medical sepsis. (iii) Develop high fidelity, in vitro models of human myeloid-derived
suppressor cells (MDSCs) with which to perform preclinical testing of potential therapies for sepsis-induced
CCI. Hypothesis: human MDSCs (immature myeloid cells that expand during chronic infection and suppress
immune responses) can be generated through differentiation from peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated
from whole blood. These cells can be used as a novel preclinical model with which to test potential therapies
for CCI that are extrapolated from the treatment of cancer. The PI of this grant application is a clinician-
scientist and the current recipient of a K08 award from the NIGMS which studies sepsis. He is ready to
progress to scientific independence via the R-35 grant mechanism for early-stage investigators."
10909971,"Project Abstract:
One of the most prominent reasons to study the mechanisms underlying the success of bariatric surgery is to
replicate surgery outcomes with non-invasive treatment(s). Vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG), one of the most
frequently performed bariatric surgeries in the world, results in substantial weight loss and dramatic remission
of T2DM within 1 year. The drastic postprandial increase in the levels of gut-secreted peptides, such as
glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), peptide YY (PYY), and cholecystokinin
(CCK), after VSG has been hypothesized to be a critical mechanism of surgical success because of their roles
in satiety and glucose homeostasis. The gut-peptides are made in the intestinal epithelium, and we (and others)
see that VSG increases the number of GLP-1-secreting enteroendocrine cells (EEC). A key question we wish
to address is what drives the EEC differentiation after VSG, whether this EEC differentiation limited to the GLP-
1-secreting cells or the other EECs, and whether this increase contributes to weight loss and improvements in
glucose homeostasis seen with VSG. Our preliminary data demonstrate that VSG alters explicitly intestinal
stem cell (ISC) expression of several genes that regulate intestinal secretory cell development including EEC
differentiation. Using a novel intestinal organoid model (enteroids), we next demonstrated that specific
subspecies of bile acids increase the GLP-1-secreting EECs. Hence, we hypothesize that the increased in bile
acid secretion after VSG impacts the ISC fate towards EECs and this is critical to bariatric surgery outcomes.
Here, we propose a combination of complementary in vitro and in vivo studies using human and mouse
enteroids and mouse genetic manipulation with VSG surgery to test the following specific aims: 1) test
hypothesis that bile acids drive EEC differentiation; 2) test hypothesis that modulation of ISC fate affects body
weight and glucose homeostasis; 3) test hypothesis that increased EEC differentiation is necessary for VSG
outcomes. This research plan is expected to make a significant contribution to the understanding of ISC
homeostasis and to determine the origin of the surgery-induced increase in gut-peptides levels with the
ultimate goal of developing an alternative strategy to bariatric surgery. During the grant period, Dr. Sandoval,
who is an expert in endocrinology and bariatric surgery, will provide an exceptional research environment and
resources at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus and also provide guidance in research
strategy, grant writing, lab management, and networking and communication. Drs. Inge, Dempsey (CU),
Samuelson, Spence (UM) and Sethupathy (Cornell University), who are experts in bariatric surgery,
developmental and/or stem cell biology, will provide additional guidance and training activities as detailed in
the Career development activity. Successfully achieved aims will lead me to a NIH-funded independent
researcher studying the mechanism of VSG to reproduce its surgical benefits with a non-invasive strategy in
the treatment the obesity and T2DM within a medical sciences department."

People with hearing loss represent one of the largest disability groups in society. Hearing loss extends across
all ethnic and socioeconomic groups, and covers two broad spectra: first, the degree of loss, ranging from hard
of hearing (correctable with hearing aids) to profound (which often can be mitigated with cochlear implants); and
second, etiology which can be congenital, progressive, late-onset or acquired. Each of these can affect the extent
of the challenges faced by people with hearing loss, but any hearing loss negatively affects communication –
and therefore socialization - to some degree. Significant technological advances over the past 20 years have
greatly improved the capacity of people with hearing loss to listen and speak; improved hearing increases
information received and, with training, children with hearing loss can learn to listen, speak and participate in
mainstream activities. However, students with hearing loss at mainstream public schools and colleges still
struggle with reduced access to auditory information and deal with the societal challenges of isolation, ignorance
and invisibility. In spite of these barriers, there are individuals with hearing loss who have succeeded in executive
and professorial careers in STEMM, particularly in auditory sciences. In this R25 proposal, Johns Hopkins
University (JHU) will implement a multi-institutional distributed mentoring model called STEMM-HEAR. The
successful development of this model will be a template for other university programs to recruit underrepresented
minorities (URM), particularly those with disabilities, and guide research leaders in providing an encouraging and
supportive internship experience to promote greater diversity in STEMM. By acquiring research experiences with
mentors who are auditory scientists with hearing loss, 32-52 students with hearing loss will develop improved
social and emotional capabilities needed to maximize their potential in STEMM. The model will accelerate the
recruitment of students with hearing loss into careers in STEMM, including the hearing sciences. JHU will work
with the Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing and Hearing Loss Association of
America to recruit 8-12 trainees annually to work in hearing sciences laboratories at Oregon Health & Science
University, University of Southern California, Creighton University, Rice University and later at Stanford
University and University of Minnesota. By participating in summer internship programs at these institutions,
these students will acquire and share research experiences via a peer network mentoring program within a
community of scientists and engineers with hearing loss."
10903858,"ABSTRACT (Core C)
High quality, consistent and reproducible quantitation and functional data are critical for the success of this
Program Project. The overarching goal of the HDL Quantitation and Function Core (Core C) is to meet this
need in a centralized and consistent manner across the entire Program. The Core is structured to provide the
following services: 1) quantitation of HDL particle size and concentration (whether isolated from plasma or
reconstituted HDL particles) for specific structural studies, using calibrated differential ion mobility analysis
(cIMA); 2) mass spectrometric analyses to characterize the protein composition of HDL particles isolated or
prepared by Program investigators, and chemical crosslinking strategies to support their structural studies; the
Core will also use mass spectrometry to confirm the identity and purity of the recombinant proteins prepared by
Core D; 3) a combination of accurate measurement of HDL particle concentration by calibrated IMA and
accurate quantification of apolipoproteins by LC-MS/MS, including quantification of the stoichiometry of
apolipoproteins on HDL particles; 4) bioinformatic support for interpreting HDL-P and proteomic data sets and
for combining the data with information from Gene Ontology, protein-protein interactions, and pathway
analysis; 5) measurements of cholesterol and phospholipid efflux, using baby hamster kidney cells
conditionally expressing WT and mutant human ABCA1. Core C will be led by Tomas Vaisar, Ph.D., working
closely with Chongren Tang, Ph.D., and it will be located at the University of Washington South Lake Union
campus, where Project 1 is also located. Both labs have extensive, well-documented expertise in all areas of
the Core’s proposed services. In the previous PPG cycle, this Core performed over 1000 analyses of HDL-P
and size, over 500 LC-MS/MS analyses of HDL’s proteome, and crosslinking studies for characterizing and
experimentally verifying theoretical models of HDL and ABCA1 structures. These services will be extended in
this proposal. Collectively, they will enable cost-effective and rigorous testing of the hypotheses generated by
the various Projects."

Zinc (Zn) is an essential trace metal to all forms of life that becomes toxic at high concentrations. Because it
has both antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties, Zn is used as a therapeutic agent to treat a variety of
infectious and non-infectious human conditions. While the efficacy of Zn as an anticaries agent is somewhat
controversial, Zn salts are used in several oral healthcare products to prevent calculus formation, treat
gingivitis and halitosis, and to control dental plaque accumulation. However, the consequences of rising
salivary Zn levels above physiological concentrations to microbial and host-pathogen interactions are poorly
understood and warrant further investigation. Recently, we discovered that S. mutans, a keystone pathogen in
dental caries, is inherently more tolerant to the toxic effects of Zn than other streptococci, including commensal
species associated with oral health. Using transcriptome and mutational analysis approaches, we identified a
previously uncharacterized P1B-type ATPase exporter and cognate transcriptional factor, which we respectively
named ZccE and ZccR, as primarily responsible for the remarkable high Zn tolerance of S. mutans. Searching
public databases, we found that ZccE is unique to S. mutans providing an opportunity for the development of
Zn-based antimicrobial therapies specifically tailored to eliminate S. mutans. Our working hypotheses are that
the ability to overcome Zn toxicity is an important aspect of S. mutans pathophysiology, and that the
identification of ZccE inhibitors can pave the way for the development of a species-specific Zn-based
therapeutic modality. With the long-term goal of developing new anticaries therapies in mind, the specific goals
of this conceptually, technically, and translationally innovative application are: (i) to uncover the regulatory
mechanisms and pathways that mediate Zn tolerance in S. mutans; (ii) to determine the implications of
increasing Zn concentrations, above physiological levels, to the composition and homeostasis of the oral
microbiome; and (iii) to explore and then develop ZccE as an antimicrobial target. To accomplish these goals,
the PI assembled a multidisciplinary team of investigators with complementary expertise in molecular
microbiology and animal models (Abranches and Lemos), structured-based computer-aided drug design (Li),
and medicinal chemistry (Huigens and Li). Completion of this study will: (i) significantly advance our
understanding of the regulatory mechanisms and pathways that mediate bacterial Zn tolerance with the
potential of revealing new therapeutic targets; (ii) shed light onto the implications and potential of Zn-based
therapies in oral health and, more specifically, in caries control; and (iii) facilitate the rational design of new
antimicrobial therapies to prevent/control the emergence of cariogenic biofilms."

Dopamine lies at the center of drug reward. All drugs with addiction potential increase dopamine levels in the
brain in their initial action, whether directly or indirectly. However, drugs of abuse also engage other
neurotransmitters and lead to changes in neuronal signaling affecting distributed functional circuitry. Especially
in the long term, the modulation of brain activation in response to repeated drug exposure involves
neuroadaptations not only at dopamine receptors but at multiple targets. These non-dopaminergic influences on
drug reward processing and addiction have not been extensively investigated but are key to understanding the
molecular connectome during stages of drug abuse.
For this Avenir Award, we propose to develop pharmacological positron emission tomography (PET)
simultaneously with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as a platform to study neuroadaptations in
multi-receptor systems and their effect on functional signaling and networks in the living brain. Based on previous
work developed in our lab for imaging dopamine receptor adaptations, we will develop and validate a multi-modal
whole-brain imaging-based approach to disentangle how dopamine interacts with multiple neuroreceptors and
neurotransmitter systems. Experiments will be carried out in nonhuman primates to ensure the future
translational value of the methodologies and findings. The dynamics of multi-receptor targets will be imaged
simultaneously with fMRI at key timepoints during repeated exposure to psychostimulants to develop
neuroimaging signatures of receptor adaptations. Pharmacological blocking studies will be paired with stimulant-
induced dopamine release to unravel the differential contributions of specific pharmacological targets and related
neurotransmitter systems at various time points. Given its pivotal role in neuroplasticity, a focus will be on the
involvement of the glutamatergic system and its interplay with dopamine. The insight gained from these classes
of experiments will advance novel tools and methodology, and enable us to decipher the neuropharmacology of
brain activation during stages of drug exposure. This program has the potential to lead to the revelation of novel
drug targets for therapeutic intervention and expand our knowledge about the dynamics of neurochemistry
underlying the whole-brain functional circuitry involved in drug addiction."

The Administrative Core of the Washington University/University of Oklahoma/University of New Mexico
Specialized Program of Research Excellence (SPORE) Route 66 Endometrial Cancer SPORE will provide
executive oversight, advocacy review, and administrative support for three projects, two cores (Biospecimens,
Metabolomics, and Pathology Core and the Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core), and the Developmental
Research and Career Enhancement Programs. The Administrative Core leaders will receive advice from an
Endometrial Cancer Equity Group, Patient Advocates, an Internal Advisory Board, and an External Advisory
Board. The first overall objective of the Administrative Core is to provide administrative support for the Route
66 Endometrial Cancer SPORE by overseeing all SPORE components, including subcontracts and per-case
payment distribution; preparing annual progress reports to the National Cancer Institute; interacting with the
Grants and Contracts Office at Washington University in St. Louis and with the Program Director and Chief of

10711362,"Pilot Project Summary
The University of Washington Center of Excellence in Opioid Addiction Research would continue a Pilot
Project Core designed to support two new projects per year. Proposed pilot projects will be solicited annually
from the 27 NIDA P30 Participants. Proposals would follow the R21 format: with an Abstract, 1-page of Specific
Aims, and a 6-page Research Plan. To avoid conflicts of interest, Pilot Proposals would be reviewed and ranked
by the External Advisors based on a simple set of criteria: Priority will be given to proposals that 1) address an
aspect of opioid use disorder, 2) support trainees or early-stage investigators, 3) utilize the Imaging and Neural
Circuits Core and Molecular Genetics Research Core resources, and 4) emphasize innovation/high risk. The
specific deliverables expected (e.g., figures for research publications and new grant submissions) are expected
to be described in the applications. Proposals that supplement existing funding would be excluded. The
Applicants with the top two scores will be expected to revise their proposals based on the External Advisors’
reviews prior to funding. IACUC approvals and adherence to all NIH rules will be required prior to starting.
Compliance would be ensured by the PI/PD. Progress will be monitored by the PI/PD to ensure that the
Investigators receive the training and equipment access required to complete their projects; training and access
will be coordinated with the help of the INCC and MGRC Core Managers (Drs. Zhou and Schattauer). Pilot
Project Investigators will present their progress at the weekly Research Seminar series. A written progress report
will be required at the end of the term that will be included in the P30 non-competing renewal annually submitted

by our NIDA-T32 DA007278 and individual NRSA awards. Providing research support to fellows already having
stipend support from the T32 or an individual NRSA award will leverage the Pilot Project funds and strengthen
our training program. This Pilot Project program has been very successful in its first 3 years of support. Supported
studies have generated multiple manuscripts and new grant proposals. The two Pilots in the current YR04 budget
commenced May 2022 and have not yet presented their 6-mon report but seem to be advancing well."
10914200,"TR&D 1 Project Summary
The ultimate goal of this TR&D 1 is to develop a small molecule PET radiotracer for in vivo imaging of
Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2) for multiple sclerosis (MS), bladder cancer, and other diseases.
Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) binds to a superfamily of five receptors, S1PR1-5, which play critical regulatory
roles in pathophysiological processes in a variety of common human diseases. S1PR2 was first cloned from rat
aortic vascular smooth muscle cells and later identified as a high affinity S1P receptor (S1PR). S1PR2 modulates
various cellular signaling pathways including cell growth and survival, migration, and adhesion in inflammation,
fibrosis, diabetes, and cancer. Although S1PR1 is up-regulated by activated astrocytes and myeloid cells,
S1PR2 also contributes significantly to inflammation in CNS autoimmune diseases and other diseases.
S1PR2 is expressed by brain endothelial cells and modulates microglial activation. In MS, infiltrates rich in
immune cells are found in the meninges within highly organized structures named ectopic lymphoid follicles
(ELF) that mimic secondary lymphoid organs. A key role for S1PR2 in MS is regulating the infiltration of
immune cells into the meninges. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a rodent model of
relapsing-recurring-MS (RR-MS); treatment of animals with the S1P2 antagonist JTE-013 significantly diminishes
the accumulation of meningeal lymphocytes following relapses. S1PRs and their signaling pathways also play a
critical role in the destiny of cancer cells. The different S1PR subtypes (S1PR1-5) have different functions in
cancer. Studies of bladder cancer tissue samples showed that S1PR1/2 subtype mRNA expression level
correlates with different grades and stages of bladder urothelial carcinoma, suggesting that S1PR2 could
be a biomarker for bladder carcinoma; targeting S1PR2 may provide an innovative therapeutic strategy. In
partnership with our Collaborative Projects (CPs) we will accomplish two specific aims in developing a C-11 or
F-18 labeled S1PR2 specific PET radiotracer: 1) We will design and synthesize new S1PR2 ligands then
determine their in vitro binding potency and selectivity for S1PR2; S1PR2 ligands will be radiolabeled with C-11
or F-18; 2) Biological evaluation of the radiotracers in animals including: a) studies with our CPs using rodent
models of MS and a rodent model of bladder cancer, b) evaluation of both S1PR1 and S1PR2 radiotracers for
autoimmune response for in rodent model of MS by a CP, c) PET brain imaging study in nonhuman primates
and radiometabolite analysis of the most promising radiotracer based on feedback from our CPs. Radiolabeled
precursors and cold reference compounds, and the radiochemistry protocols will be shipped to CPs and Service
Projects and other entities that are interested at exploring S1PR2 radiotracers for these and other applications.
Upon completion of this renewal, the most promising S1PR2 radiotracer will be ready for further dosimetry/toxicity
studies prior to seeking FDA approval for human use."
10914205,"TR&D 2 Project Summary
Macrophages are innate immune cells present in all major tissues and are responsible for homeostasis.
Macrophages sense and respond to pathogens and other environmental challenges and participate in tissue
repair after injury. Recent research reveals macrophages as remarkably plastic cells that are epigenetically
programmed in response to signals originating from the tissue environment. The macrophage heterogeneity and
plasticity is evident from how the microenvironment shapes macrophage phenotype and functional identity that
ensures ongoing adaption of macrophages to the environment. Typically, macrophages are defined as M1
macrophages (classically activated pro-inflammatory macrophages) and M2 macrophages (alternatively
activated tissue-resident anti-inflammatory macrophages). M1 macrophages are pro-inflammatory and have a
central role in host defense against inflammation and infection, while M2 macrophages are associated with
responses to anti-inflammatory reactions and tissue remodeling, and they represent two terminals of the full
spectrum of macrophage activation. Since the transformation of different phenotypes of macrophages regulates
the initiation, development, and cessation of inflammatory diseases, it is critical to track the well-defined
macrophages populations with constant expression of surface markers across multiple organs to interrogate
their temporal and spatial distribution along the progression and regression of inflammatory diseases or
malignancies. Based on our previous work and published data, we have identified chemokine receptor type 2
(CCR2) as a surface biomarker for M1 macrophage and CD163 as a biomarker for M2 macrophage. We have
developed the first CCR2 radiotracer imaging inflammation in animal models and malignancies, as well as
humans. We have also developed the first CD163 radiotracer for initial evaluation. In this proposal, we plan to
further improve the imaging efficiency of CCR2 and thoroughly assess CD163 tracers in order to determine the
temporal and spatial distribution of M1 and M2 macrophages in inflammatory diseases and cancers. Therefore,
we proposal the following 3 specific aims working closely with our Collaborative Projects. Aim 1. Develop new
CCR2 targeted radiotracers imaging M1 pro-inflammatory macrophages. Aim 2. Develop CD163 targeted
radiotracer imaging M2 tissue resident macrophages. Aim 3. Validate macrophage-specific radiotracers to detect
heterogeneity, temporal and spatial distribution of macrophages in inflammatory diseases and malignancies.
These products and those developed in the current grant cycle will be provided to our Service Projects as well."
10914211,"TR&D 3 Project Summary
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulate critical physiological functions. However, the imbalance in
production/mitigation of ROS also mediates pathogenesis of numerous diseases ranging from cardiovascular
sciences to oncology clinic. Through the current funding cycle of TR&D3 program, we have identified a lead PET
tracer (described herein as {68Ga}Galuminox) for imaging systemic inflammation and demonstrate its ability to
monitor LPS-induced inflammation within lungs (acute lung injury model), monitor β3 integrin-mediated
chemoresistance in breast cancer bone metastases, and kidney injury in nephrotic syndrome model. Importantly,
Galuminox provides a sensitive readout of mitochondrial ROS (mROS) in human cells. Combined data indicate
make {68Ga}Galuminox a worthy candidate of its advancement for regulatory approvals to evaluate safety
through human dosimetry studies. Given its desirable trait to serve as a redox sensitive reporter probe,
Galuminox also provides a template scaffold for generation and validation of copper-64 or fluorine-18
counterparts (with shorter positron range) as alternative PET tracers. Unfortunately, Galuminox analogues would
not penetrate blood brain barrier (BBB) thus limiting their utility for assessing ROS mediated systemic
inflammation. To achieve functional imaging of mROS within the brain, we have rationally designed small
heterocyclic molecule ({18F}SLN128). Like Galuminox, SLN-128 is a highly fluorescent probe thus allowing
opportunities for dual optical-PET readout for its biochemical validations. Compared with Galuminox which
detects superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, SLN128 detects superoxide and hydroxyl radical. Given that both
radiotracers have two different PET radionuclides and offer different detection capabilities, we anticipate that
both PET molecular imaging probes could provide complementary information of oxidative imbalance mediating
pathogenesis of both non-CNS and CNS diseases. Specific aims of TRD3 renewal are: Aim 1: Evaluate safety
of {68Ga}Galuminox through human dosimetry studies following regulatory approvals. Aim 1.1: Evaluate the
performance of {68Ga}Galuminox for imaging inflammation using rodent models of ischemic- and bacterial
exotoxin-induced acute lung injury as well as other models of oxidative stress acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ADRS), cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE) -mediated ischemic vascular remodeling, and meningeal ROS
in MS through the Collaborative Projects. Aim1.2: To compensate for higher positron range of gallium-68 in
Galuminox and allow options for delayed imaging in gastrointestinal tract, we propose to synthesize,
biochemically characterize Cu-64 and F-18 counterparts of Galuminox and evaluate their pharmacokinetic
profiles in diseased rodent models. Aim 1.3: As an exploratory aim, we also propose to design and develop
small organic heterocyclic molecules for assessment of mROS prevalent in pathogenesis of neurodegenerative
diseases. These products and those developed in the current grant cycle will be provided to our Service Projects
as well."

10810776,"ABSTRACT
Enterococci are the 3rd most common cause of hospital-acquired infections and a major public health threat
due to the continuous rise of multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates. Because the pathogenic potential of
enterococci is closely linked to their ubiquitous stress resilience, work in our lab aims to identify and dissect the
mechanisms that allow Enterococcus faecalis, the most prevalent enterococcal species of human infections, to
survive in the hostile host environment. Second messenger nucleotides such as (p)ppGpp (the effector
molecule of the stringent response) and c-di-AMP are produced by bacteria in response to internal or external
stimuli, playing major roles in the regulation of processes associated with cell homeostasis and virulence. In
addition, cyclic nucleotides such as c-di-AMP act as agonists of the innate immune response of mammalians by
stimulating a potent STING-dependent type I interferon response. Of interest, previous investigations have
shown that the c-di-AMP and (p)ppGpp signaling networks are interconnected in other bacteria, but a clear
understanding of the mechanics and physiological significance of this interaction are still lacking. In previous
studies, we discovered that E. faecalis depends on small amounts of (p)ppGpp to maintain a balanced
metabolism and to respond to external cues in an accurate and timely manner. We also found that lack of
(p)ppGpp greatly increases antibiotic sensitivity and attenuates the virulence of E. faecalis. More recently, we
showed that c-di-AMP is also critical to E. faecalis pathophysiology and that either accumulation or lack of c-
di-AMP can drastically impair the virulence potential of E. faecalis. The goals of this application are: (i) to
probe the multifaceted roles played by c-di-AMP during infection using a catheter-associated urinary tract
infection (CAUTI) mouse model that recapitulates many of the clinical characteristics of the disease in humans,
(ii) to identify and characterize the c-di-AMP binding/effector proteins in E. faecalis, and (iii) to investigate
how integration of the c-di-AMP and (p)ppGpp regulatory networks controls specific processes that promote
bacterial fitness and then determine how this association contributes to E. faecalis pathophysiology. This
conceptually innovative application builds on our extensive preliminary data and the complementary
expertise and solid track record of our research team in each specific area of this application. Significance of
the proposed studies lies in unravelling the multifaceted role of c-di-AMP in host-pathogen interactions,
uncovering the scope of c-di-AMP regulation in a major MDR pathogen, and shedding new light onto the
intricate relationship between c-di-AMP and (p)ppGpp. Given the central role of regulatory nucleotides in
bacterial pathogenesis, a better understanding of how they modulate cell physiology based on identification
and characterization of their mechanisms of action and effectors can facilitate the rational design of new
antimicrobial therapies."
10886112,"Scientific Abstract
Hemoglobin, the oxygen carrying protein expressed in erythrocytes, can be glycated following elevations in blood
glucose. Some amino acids, such as the N-terminal valine of the hemoglobin beta chain are highly susceptible
to glycation in diabetic patients. This specific glycated isoform, termed HbA1c, has been used by clinicians as
an overall picture of a diabetic patient’s ability to control their glucose over a 3-month period and as an indicator
for future cardiovascular risks. Recently, it was observed that the alpha chain of hemoglobin, but not the beta
chain, is expressed in endothelial cells lining arteries where it interacts with endothelial nitric oxide synthase
(eNOS) to modulate nitric oxide (NO) release. Hemoglobin alpha is known to be glycated at a number of sites,
including one in the putative eNOS interaction domain. Since it is well recognized that vascular dysfunction
underlies many of the pathologies in diabetic patients, it was hypothesized that the hemoglobin alpha expressed
in the endothelium will have aberrant function in diabetes mellitus, likely due to a glycation event. The aim of the
current proposal is to examine the role of hemoglobin alpha and any possible glycated forms of hemoglobin
alpha in the endothelium of a murine model of diabetes. Using pharmacological and genetic approaches, the
interaction between hemoglobin alpha and eNOS will be disrupted and the influence on the development of
vascular dysfunction will be explored. This work has the potential to identify both a novel biomarker of vascular
risk and also a potential therapeutic target for pharmacological treatments."
10815540,"Project Summary/Abstract: Enteric synucleinopathy is characterized by the deposition of misfolded α-
synuclein aggregates in enteric neurons and induces long-term gastrointestinal dysfunction. Enteric
synucleinopathy is also thought to be a precursor to CNS synucleinopathies, such as Parkinson’s’ Disease (PD),
PD-Dementia, and Lewy Body Dementia, a collective group of debilitating neurodegenerative disorders that
cause motor, cognitive, and autonomic dysfunction. Notably, even after development of CNS synucleinopathy
gastrointestinal symptoms remain as major causes of morbidity in these patients. However, a poor understanding
of the cellular processes underlying development and progression has precluded any therapies aimed at
preventing synucleinopathy progression into the brain or mitigating GI dysfunction. In the central nervous system
resident macrophages, the microglia, can have pronounced impact on synucleinopathy. Enteric neuron-
associated macrophages resemble microglia at rest in that they support nearby neurons. But unlike microglia,
their phenotype and role in enteric synucleinopathy is undefined. Therefore, the Aims of this proposal seek to
define how enteric neuron associated macrophages promote or palliate the neuropathological and
neurophysiological aspects of enteric synucleinopathy.
Aim 1: Explicate the macrophage subpopulations that influence spread of phosphorylated α-synuclein
pathology in a mouse model of enteric synucleinopathy. Herein, I will characterize macrophage involvement
in the development and spread of enteric, phosphorylated α-synuclein neuropathology and define the immune
transcriptional landscape associated with this state. My working hypothesis for this aim is that a sub-population
of macrophages initially take up α-synuclein to mitigate pathology and adopt an antigen-presentation phenotype
to activate T-cells
Aim 2: Determine how myenteric macrophages modulate enteric neuronal network functional and
structural connectivity in a mouse model of enteric synucleinopathy. Alterations in myenteric macrophage
phenotype and α-synuclein pathology have been shown to induce enteric neuronal network dysfunction and gut
dysmotility independently, but how they work in concert in the setting of enteric synucleinopathy remains
unknown. More specifically, whether myenteric macrophages mediate α-synuclein’s effects on network
connectivity and network output has not been investigated. Thus, my working hypothesis for this aim is that α-
synuclein pathology will prompt myenteric macrophages to engage in excessive, complement-dependent
synaptic pruning leading to disrupted enteric neuronal network activity. Together, these experiments will reveal
how neuro-immune interactions influence the early stages of synucleinopathies."
11006242,"Project Summary
Studies have shown that women report more sleep difficulties and are more likely to be diagnosed with insomnia
compared to men. Sleep disturbances are more likely to occur in women during times of hormonal fluctuations,
including pregnancy and menopause, thus indicating that sex hormones play a role in the sleep-wake cycle.
Understanding more about how sex hormones act to influence sleep can help us develop targeted treatments
for women who suffer from sleep disorders. There are 2 major sleep centers in the brain, both located in the
hypothalamus – the median preoptic nucleus (MnPO) and the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO). There are
estrogen receptors located in the MnPO, but not in the VLPO, suggesting that estrogen acts via the MnPO to
regulate sleep-wake states. The MnPO is thought to promote sleep by inhibiting wake-promoting neurons in the
brain. It has been found that estradiol (E2) infusion into the MnPO increases wake and decreases sleep in
ovariectomized female rats, however the mechanism by which sleep is disrupted by E2 is largely unknown.
During wakefulness, adenosine accumulates in the brain and increases sleep pressure, causing tiredness. The
A1 and A2A receptors (A1R and A2AR) are expressed in the MnPO and play an important role in regulating the
effects of adenosine in the brain. Infusion of an A1R agonist into the MnPO has been found to increase wake
and decrease sleep in rats, while infusion of an A2AR agonist has been found to increase sleep and decrease
wake. E2 has been hypothesized to influence the inhibitory/excitatory adenosinergic balance in the MnPO, as,
in the presence of E2, the sleep-promoting effects of an A2AR agonist are blocked. One potential target of E2 is
G protein-coupled receptor 37 (GPR37), as it has been shown to inhibit A2AR surface expression and function in
the striatum. This project will test the hypothesis that E2 is decreasing NREM sleep and increasing wake
by attenuating A2AR signaling through GPR37 modulation. To examine the effects of GPR37 in the MnPO,
we are going to (1) Determine if E2 is sufficient for GPR37 upregulation in the MnPO, (2) Determine if A2AR and
GPR37 form an interaction in the sleep active cells of the MnPO, and (3) Determine if GPR37 is necessary to
cause E2-induced changes in sleep-wake states. Understanding estradiol’s role in the disruption of the sleep-
wake cycle will help us gain greater insight into one of the unique mechanisms of insomnia in women and
ultimately with how we can better treat insomnia in a substantial portion of the population."
10909173,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Substance use disorders are among the most common psychiatric disorders and are a leading cause of disability
throughout the world. Over the last decade, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous genetic
loci that contribute to addiction (opioid, tobacco, cannabis, alcohol). Turning these discoveries into mechanistic insights, a
necessary first step for understanding the pathophysiology of addiction, and ultimately leading to the development of new
therapies, is challenging. Model organisms serve as excellent tools to understand how human genomic variation affects
traits. However, integration of human GWAS data with studies in model organisms has been limited. This is because
GWAS do not lead to the identification of genes, but genetic variants (or SNPs), which cannot be easily translated across
species. In addition, human GWAS have shown that risk for addiction is highly polygenic, but the existing strategies for
cross-species translation do not capture the polygenic architecture of addiction. I am proposing an innovative solution to
this problem by developing a framework for cross-species polygenic translation. Polygenic risk scores (PRS), which are a
widely used tool for human genetic studies, predict risk for a trait by summing the contributions of numerous SNPs.
Because these SNPs are species-specific, it is not possible to apply a PRS to another species. I am proposing to use
transcriptomic analyses to overcome this obstacle. Leveraging resources and techniques from well-established statistical
genetic tools, I will develop a method that will allow translation of polygenic signals from humans to rodents, and vice-
versa. This will be accomplished by using the following steps: 1) use GWAS for addiction-related traits in human and
model organisms to compile catalogs of genetic variants; 2) use transcriptomic data from GTEx and analogous datasets
from model organisms to build gene prediction models, allowing estimation of transcript levels in individuals based on
genotype information, 3) determine the association between these estimated transcript levels and addiction-related traits
and 4) use these gene-level associations (rather than SNP level associations) to calculate Polygenic Transcriptomic Risk
Scores (PTRS). This approach translates SNPs into gene estimated gene expression levels and then takes advantage of the
fact that, while the same SNPs do not exist across species, gene orthology can be used to translate between species. In
addition, I will use complementary methodologies, including cross-species network analyses and other tools, that also
account for
the polygenic nature of addiction. Developing tools that allow polygenic studies to share information between
humans and model organisms will be transformative by opening up entirely new lines of research. For example, PTRS
will provide a novel means of validating animal models of addiction, as it will be possible to empirically test whether the
genetic signature for addiction in humans is related to the genetic signature of addiction phenotypes in rodents. PTRS will
also serve as a toolkit for drug repositioning, namely studies aimed at identifying small molecules and other interventions
that can alter the global gene expression in model organisms in a way that lower risk, as predicted by PTRS and network-
based analyses."

David Ginty and Chris Harvey who is dedicated to a career as an academic researcher. Drs. Emanuel, Ginty, and Harvey have developed a 12-point career development plan that will enable Dr. Emanuel's transition to an independent research position. This plan incorporates resources available at Harvard Medical School, including formal and informal training from the community within the Department of Neurobiology and the broader Harvard Medical School community. Formal training includes attendance at seminars on professional development and responsible conduct of research as well as engaging the wider scientific community with publication of manuscripts describing Dr. Emanuel's work and presentations at international meetings. Overall, this plan will optimally prepare Dr. Emanuel for the transition to an independent career. Research Plan: The goal of this project is to determine how the representation of complex features in primary somatosensory cortex are produced by cortical and subcortical neural circuitry and how these representations are adapted for the behavior of the animal. Specifically, the experiments in this proposal will use mouse genetic approaches and in vivo electrophysiology to address the neural underpinnings of speed, direction, and orientation tuning in primary somatosensory cortex (Aim 1). Combining in vivo electrophysiology with genetic manipulations and recording from primary somatosensory cortex will determine the extent to which these cortical representations are necessary for and adapt to performance of tactile behaviors (Aim 2). Finally, combining in vivo electrophysiology in freely moving animals with modern computer vision for monitoring behavior and the force applied to the skin will determine how neurons in primary somatosensory cortex are engaged during natural movements and environmental interactions (Aim 3). In all, these experiments will yield insight into the fundamental processes underlying sensory processing in the central nervous system."
10911183,"Summary:
Glioblastoma represents a complex disease in which heterogeneity in both tumor composition and drug
distribution needs to be considered for understanding treatment response. Genetic, epigenetic and
developmental programs that differ between malignant cells influence the response to any drug candidates
(DC). Additionally, pathophysiological barriers of the microenvironment and vasculature, such as the blood-
brain barrier (BBB), produce heterogeneous distribution of DC, de facto exposing heterogeneous malignant
cells and their microenvironment to variable drug concentrations. Assessing these variable parameters is
paramount to precisely dissect the response of glioblastoma to any DC. Many targeted therapy trials have
failed to incorporate such measurements, hampering our ability to interpret results. The Pharmacological and
Genomic Imaging Core (PGIC) of the Harvard/Stanford U19 Program will provide state-of-art technical
expertise and resources for characterizing drug concentration and glioblastoma response in patient tumor
samples and in comprehensively characterized orthotopic mouse patient-derived xenografts (PDX) glioma
models. PGIC brings together multiscale technologies from microscale analysis to macroscale organ in vivo
imaging with micro- and macro-scale registration. PGIC provides an integrated platform to fuse detailed
histopathology, drug distribution, metabolomics, and single-cell transcriptomics with registration to in vivo
imaging when available. Specifically, PGIC will: (Aim1) perform spatially-resolved measurements of DC and
metabolic pathways in brain tissue specimens sampled from both clinical trials and experimental models; (Aim
2) perform single-nucleus RNA-sequencing analysis of glioma and microenvironmental cells from frozen
clinical samples and pre-clinical models of glioblastoma; (Aim 3) perform spatial analysis of dynamic
therapeutic effects in glioblastoma patient samples and models using spatial transcriptomics and multiplex
digital imaging. We have developed innovative and efficient clinical pipelines and multi-site clinical trials
infrastructure to obtain samples for PGIC analysis and put in place systematic workflows in the hospital setting.
Our analyses will be performed on frozen samples, facilitating the flow of acquired specimen across multiple
sites in the Harvard/Stanford GTN. PGIC will provide consistent workflows, standardize the acquisition of
samples and data, provide expert personnel, facilitate the sharing of knowledge within the program, and
maintain the sophisticated equipment necessary to generate data for all Projects which is critical for data
reproducibility and data sharing across projects. PGIC will be led Dr. Mario Suvà, Dr Nathalie Agar and Dr.
Keith Ligon who will contribute their expertise in single-cell technologies, mass spectrometry imaging and
neuropathology."
10911187,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Gliomas represent 80% of the 26,000 newly diagnosed cases of malignant brain and central nervous system
tumors in the United States each year and are among the most lethal and treatment-resistant human cancers.
Although there is a dire need for effective therapies for this disease, the standard treatment for gliomas has not
changed since 2005 and no new medical therapies have been approved for adult gliomas in the last decade. In
response to this challenge, we have devised a new way to treat gliomas that have a mutation in either of the
IDH1 or IDH2 genes. Collectively, IDH mutations are present in ~20% of adult diffuse gliomas, indicating that
any treatment advance in this patient population would have broad impact. Based on our knowledge that IDH
mutations cause profound metabolic reprogramming in glioma cells, we used a novel pharmacological
screening platform to systematically identify vulnerabilities that result from this process. We discovered that a
class of drugs targeting nucleotide metabolism preferentially kill glioma cells with IDH mutations, thereby
revealing an avenue for tumor-selective, biomarker-guided therapy that is poised for rapid clinical translation.
To build on this discovery and translate exploitation of this vulnerability to the clinic, we propose to conduct a
phase 0 surgical window clinical trial of a brain-penetrant nucleotide metabolism inhibitor in IDH-mutant grade
4 glioma patients. We will characterize response to this agent by addressing three Specific Aims. Specific Aim
#1 is to use matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI), conventional
liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy to comprehensively
characterize the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of this targeted therapeutic in glioma
patients. Specific Aim #2 is to investigate how this inhibitor alters the biology of IDH-mutant grade 4 gliomas at
the molecular and cellular levels by analyzing resected primary tissue samples via single-cell RNA sequencing
and immunohistochemistry. Finally, Specific Aim #3 is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of this drug in a
focused cohort of IDH-mutant grade 4 glioma patients. Taken together, our work will outline and test a new
treatment strategy for glioma patients that could be expanded to a larger multi-center phase II study if our trial
is successful. Furthermore, our efforts to elucidate key components of the mechanism of action of this
nucleotide metabolism inhibitor are expected to inform the rational design of combination therapies centered
on this agent that can be explored in future studies."
10911191,"Project Summary
 The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene is mutated or amplified in over half of GBMs, and its
mutation and focal amplification correlate with a more aggressive disease course. However, EGFR-directed
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have failed to show efficacy in this disease and these failures cannot be
attributed strictly to poor brain penetrance. We posit that the failure to date of EGFR TKIs for GBM reflects lack
of a therapeutic window. A lesson learned from application of EGFR inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) is that mutant-selectivity is absolutely required. Without selectivity, systemic inhibition of wild-type
(WT) EGFR signaling is the dose-limiting toxicity. In NSCLC, activating mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain
confer enhanced sensitivity to certain EGFR TKIs relative to WT EGFR, allowing true mutant-selective
inhibition. The EGFR genetic aberrations in glioblastoma (GBM) create constitutive, ligand-independent
signaling via signal generating domains that are almost exclusively WT in structure. Our objective is to create
EGFR TKIs with a therapeutic window for aberrant EGFR signaling in GBM. We have two specific aims.
 Aim 1, is to test the hypothesis that an EGFR TKI with an allosteric mechanism of action will selectively
block ligand-independent EGFR signaling in GBM while sparing ligand-activated EGFR systemically, thereby
providing a therapeutic window that allows effective treatment of EGFR-driven GBMs. In preliminary studies,
we have developed small-molecule allosteric inhibitors that potently inhibit WT EGFR (IC50 < 100 nM in
biochemical assays) and have a good oral mouse PK profile and are brain-penetrant. Guided by efficacy
studies in patient-derived GBM neurosphere and xenograft models, we expect to identify a compound suitable
for clinical development in the first grant year, to enable clinical translation in the out years.
 Aim 2, exploits CM93, a novel third generation EGFR TKI that is highly brain-penetrant – so much so
that it actually displays a positive brain/plasma ratio. We will test the hypothesis that CM93 can provide a de
facto “tissue-based” therapeutic window allowing effective inhibition of EGFR in the tumor with relative sparing
of the receptor systemically. Towards this end, we will conduct a first-in-human, phase 1, dose-escalation and
dose-expansion study, as well as a surgical “window of opportunity” study to determine the maximum tolerated
dose, evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and clinical effects of orally administered
CM93 in subjects with recurrent glioblastoma characterized by EGFR mutation or amplification.
 Studies on clinical materials will be facilitated by our Pharmacological and Genomics Imaging Core
(PGIC). The PGIC will allow us to quantify intra-tumoral accumulation of CM93 using MALDI mass
spectrometry imaging and to define the impact of CM93 treatment on tumor heterogeneity using single cell
sequencing. Collectively, these studies promise to yield new targeted therapeutics for EGFR-driven GBMs and
provide a molecular understanding of determinants of sensitivity and resistance to these agents."
10911192,"Summary
An emerging body of data draws attention to the central role of the nervous system in pathogenesis of
glioblastoma. In preliminary studies our own group has discovered that glioblastoma integrates into normal
neural circuits, and that neuronal activity drives glioblastoma growth and progression through direct
glutamatergic synapses between neurons and glioblastoma cells and by paracrine growth factors secreted by
glutamatergic synapses. In turn, glioblastoma cells secrete glutamate to increase the excitability and
consequently the activity of neurons. This glutamate-fueled, forward-feeding cycle presents a potential drug
target. We hypothesize that targeting glutamatergic signaling broadly to disrupt these neuron – glioblastoma
interactions will decrease neuronal hyperexcitability, decrease neuron-to-glioblastoma signaling and decrease
glioblastoma growth. This hypothesis makes testable predictions that can be assessed using troriluzole – a
brain penetrant drug in advanced phase clinical trials for neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases.
 In preclinical studies, we find that troriluzole decreases glutamate in the glioblastoma
microenvironment and increases survival in a murine model of glioblastoma. Going forward, our study plan has
two specific aims. We propose (Aim one) to test troriluzole in patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX)
models of IDH WT glioblastoma, and (Aim two) to conduct a surgical window-of-opportunity clinical trial of
troriluzole in adult subjects with recurrent IDH WT glioblastoma. We will assess effects of troriluzole on
glioblastoma electrophysiology in both preclinical models and in the surgical window-of-opportunity trial using
intraoperative electrocorticography to determine the effects of troriluzole on neuronal hyperexcitability.
Glutamate and drug levels will be measured in both xenograft tissue and in resected human glioblastoma
tissue using mass spectrometry imaging; glutamate levels will be further assessed in human subjects using
perioperative microdialysis and magnetic resonance spectrometry imaging. We will examine the PDOX tissue
and resected human tissue for biomarkers of neuron-glioblastoma signaling, including levels of neuroligin-3
and phosphorylated AMPA receptors (an indicator of synaptic signaling in glioblastoma through a subtype of
glutamate receptor). We will assess effects of troriluzole on glioblastoma proliferation in both GBM PDOX
models and in resected human tumor tissue, and will measure overall survival in the preclinical models and
progression-free survival in the clinical trial. Together, these studies will elucidate the efficacy of troriluzole to
decrease glutamatergic signaling in the glioblastoma microenvironment and disrupt these pathogenic neuron-
glioblastoma interactions that robustly promote glioblastoma progression."
10932173,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness, impacting 80 million people worldwide. The only
proven approach to prevent vision loss in glaucoma is the reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP), which is
most commonly achieved by topical medications. Once daily (QD) prostaglandins are a typical first-line
therapy, though the need for adjunctive therapy with other drug classes is very common. Several studies have
suggested that the addition of brimonidine, an alpha-2 agonist, is the most effective for IOP lowering.
Brimonidine is also preferred as a frontline therapy for normal tension glaucoma and patients undergoing laser
trabeculoplasty or iridotomy, and has been shown to have potential neuroprotective benefits independent of
IOP lowering. However, brimonidine is prescribed for three times daily (TID) dosing. The more drops glaucoma
patients are required to take per day, the more likely it is that issues with adherence and symptoms of ocular
surface disease develop. Thus, there is a significant opportunity to develop eye drops that can be used less
frequently while also mitigating or even alleviating symptoms of concomitant dry eye disease. Novus Vision
Inc. is developing a novel hypotonic thermosensitive gelling eye drop (OcuGel) that is liquid at room
temperature and spreads to cover the ocular surface immediately and uniformly, forming a clear gel to trap the
medication in place. Further, the gel coating provides sustained ocular surface lubrication and tear film
stabilization to alleviate symptoms of dry eye. We have observed that when formulating our OcuGel vehicle
containing brimonidine tartrate (OcuGel BT), OcuGel BT provided increased and more sustained IOP lowering
compared to Alphagan P. To further enhance and sustain IOP lowering to achieve a QD product, here we aim
to reformulate at the highest brimonidine concentration previously approved and marketed, 0.2%.
Reformulation work in Aim 1 will involve creating formulations with pharmaceutically appropriate buffering and
preservation for shelf stability and repeat use packaging, and to demonstrate stability under accelerated
degradation conditions and sterility using industry standard tests. We will identify at least three formulations at
in Aim 1 for pharmacodynamic evaluations and preclinical safety testing in rabbits in Aim 2. Using these data
and our plan for IND-enabling studies in Aim 3, we will then engage in a pre-IND meeting with the FDA. Based
on FDA feedback, we will contract to perform GLP bottle fills, stability and sterility and to perform GLP toxicity
studies in rabbits and mini-pigs. Upon completion of Aim 3, we will have an appropriate data package for an
IND submission."
10916249,"1 Background: An improved understanding of the factors that drive cancer growth and progression is
 2 fundamental for improving outcomes in patients with cancer. Individuals with Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)
 3 disease develop multiple vascular tumours in their lifetime including many hundreds of malignant
 4 cysts and clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCCs). These tumours are the genomic mirror image of
 5 sporadic ccRCCs and display variable clinical phenotypes. Profiling multiple, independent tumours
 6 that have arisen in an identical germline and host environment offers an intrinsically controlled model
 7 to study the factors underlying cancer evolution and progression in general. We will leverage the
 8 unique clinical cohort of patients with VHL Disease at the Clinical Centre to study how the molecular
 9 landscape (Objective 1), the tumour microenvironment (TME) (Objective 2) and the metabolome
10 (Objective 3) promote or restrain cancer growth.
11 Methods: Subjects will be recruited to this prospective cohort study from the Urology Oncology
12 Branch at the National Cancer Institute. Growth kinetics of individual tumours will be tracked
13 radiologically. During procurement, tumours are identified and correlated with imaging. We will
14 perform multiparametric molecular profiling, integrating all datasets to achieve our study objectives.
15 Using next generation sequencing we will characterise the events that underlie malignant
16 transformation (Objective 1.1) and the molecular events associated with differential growth kinetics
17 (Objective 1.1). We will explore events associated with tumour fromation in extra-renal sites
18 (Objective 1.3) and how molecular/environmental variants influence variable phenotypic penetration
19 amongst VHL kindred (Objective 1.4). To assess the role of the TME, we will use genomic profiling to
20 assess the neoantigen landscape (Objective 2.1) and identify differential immune cell lineages using
21 RNA sequencing (Objective 2.2). We will validate these fidnings with multiplex immunohistochemistry
22 (IHC) approach. We will assess the perturbed metabolome utilising transcriptome profiling (Objective
23 3.1) and conduct a pilot study to assess genomic and transcriptomic changes with stable isotope-
24 resolved metabolic profiles obtained from VHL tumor tissue obtained intraoperatively.
25 Conclusion: This will be the most comprehensive molecular profiling of cancers arising in VHL
26 disease. It has the potential to address key questions regarding evolutionary cancer biology and to
27 identify the triggers for tumour growth and progression and hence predictive or prognostic biomarkers
28 which may have a wider relevance to cancer. It may inform novel therapeutic strategies for the
29 treatment and prevention of hereditary and sporadic ccRCC."
10917111,"Abstract
Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the most lethal cancers in the U.S. with a 5-year survival rate of 7%, which
has essentially unchanged for the past 40 years. Despite extensive research, there are no effective targeted
therapies for this disease, suggesting an insufficient understanding of oncogenic signaling networks in PC. While
almost all of the signaling networks implicated in cancer rely on the cooperation of kinases and phosphatases to
transduce signals promoting cancer, most efforts have only been put on the study of protein kinases in cancer
while leaving protein phosphatases as a blind spot. PP2A is a family of heterotrimers that serve as the main
source of Ser/Thr phosphatase activities in human cells, with each consisting of a scaffold subunit (Aα/β), a
catalytic subunit (Cα/β), and one of many non-conserved regulatory (B) subunits (>27) that control the substrate
specificities of PP2A complexes. Our preliminary studies identified PR55α, a regulatory subunit of PP2A, as an
important new player in promoting malignant PC. In particular, our studies revealed that PR55 inhibits the
MOB1/LATS auto-activation loop of the Hippo tumor suppression pathway, whose function is to induce the
phosphorylation of YAP causing its cytoplasmic retention and proteasomal degradation. In line with the essential
role of YAP signaling in Kras-driven PC development and progression, knockdown of PR55α impeded the
anchorage-independent growth, tumorigenicity, and metastasis of PC cells. Our preliminary data also revealed
that the stability of PR55α protein is negatively regulated by the tumor suppressor p53 and its target gene
FBXL20, a substrate adaptor for the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) E3 ligase. Consistently, we observed that
PR55α is elevated in PC specimens, where its expression correlates with poor patient survival. Based on these
findings, we hypothesize that loss of p53 function results in the stabilization of PR55α protein, which, in turn,
activates the YAP oncogenic signaling required for Kras-driving PC initiation and progression. We will test the
hypothesis by three specific aims: Aim 1 to define the mechanism by which PR55α/PP2A promotes YAP
activation and the significance of this cascade in oncogenesis and malignant potential of PC, Aim 2 to elucidate
how p53 suppresses the level of PR55α, and Aim 3 to delineate the role of the PR55/YAP axis in pancreatic
cancer development and progression in the KPC spontaneous mouse model. The work is innovative, as it will
illuminate a critical pathway that promotes PC initiation and progression through PR55/PP2A activated YAP
signaling, which is novel to both the PP2A field and the PC field. Successful completion of the proposed studies
will yield an in-depth mechanistic understanding of the critical contribution of PR55/PP2A complex to the
observed cooperation between Kras activation and the loss of the p53 tumor suppressor during PC development
and progression. The acquired knowledge not only will improve the understanding of the role of PP2A in cancer
but also will contribute to identifying novel therapeutic targets for improving the treatment of PC."
10918116,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Regeneration of native skin elements – hair follicles, sweat glands and adipose tissue, is a highly thought
after outcome of wound healing. While, in principle, very large skin wounds in adult mice can spontaneously
regenerate new hair follicles and new adipocytes, commonly studied small wounds in mice and clinical wounds
in humans heal with a far less desirable fibrotic scarring. If and how adult skin wounds can be directed to replace
the natural tendency for healing with a scar with regeneration of native skin elements remains unknown.
 This application is inspired by a serendipitous discovery that adding an antigen to our novel biomaterial, the
Microporous Annealed Particle (MAP) hydrogel, can induce regeneration of new hair follicles when added into
normally fibrotic small mouse skin wounds. This immunomodulatory MAP gel provides wound-resident immune
cells with the molecular triggers that elicit an adaptive immune response to enhance macrophage responses.
Further, our studies on naturally regenerating very large skin wound model show that macrophage-fibroblast
interactions are essential for stimulating new hair follicle regeneration.
 Through an integrated bioengineering, bioinformatic and experimental approach, this application will
focus on testing our new hypothesis that by engineering MAP gels to have specific immune triggers, interactions
between T-cells, macrophages, and fibroblasts in the wound can transform normally profibrotic healing response
into highly desirable regenerative response. The first aim of the proposed research is to mechanistically establish
the lymphocyte and macrophage subsets and the molecular signaling pathways required for MAP formulations
we have created to elicit hair follicle regeneration. This will be achieved using bioinformatic analyses of
transcriptomics, proteomic, and functional profiling at single-cell resolution. confirmed with in vivo loss of function/
transgenic mouse studies lacking key immune pathways or cells MAP gels. The second aim is to engineer new
types of immunomodulatory MAP gels designed to maximally induce T-cells and macrophage pro-regenerative
signals while minimizing pro-fibrotic signals using a high-throughput in vitro assay. The third aim is to determine
how MAP gel-induced immune signals enhance lineage plasticity of wound fibroblasts that is prerequisite for
new hair regeneration. This will be achieved via an advanced bioinformatic analysis on single-cell transcriptomic
data and functional gain- and loss-of-function studies on wound immune cells and fibroblasts.
 The study premise is based on newly accepted-for-publication and extensive preliminary data. The proposed
studies are significant because they will establish new immune cell-driven mechanism for enhancing fibroblast
plasticity and activating embryonic-like regeneration of native skin elements in adult wounds. The proposed
studies are innovative because they will establish new types of immune-modulating biomaterials, and new
paradigm of biomaterial-triggered regenerative response in adult tissues. In the future, the results of this study
will drive the development of next-generation immune-modulating wound biomaterials for potential clinical use."
10832663,"The overall objective of this Phase II SBIR proposal is to develop a novel G protein-based vaccine
for the prevention of disease associated with low respiratory tract infection (LRTI) by respiratory
syncytial virus (RSV). RSV is a leading cause of lower respiratory illness in infants and young
children worldwide. It also plays significant role in respiratory illness in the elderly. There is an
urgent need and compelling reasons to develop RSV vaccine. Past and current vaccine
development efforts are mainly focused on F protein-based recombinant vaccines and live
attenuated vaccines. Despite major efforts for several decades, an effective RSV vaccine remains
elusive. RSV G protein is responsible for viral attachment to host cells. However, only a single G-
based vaccine has been studied in humans to date. In the completed Phase I SBIR study, we
developed a novel RSV vaccine that has high sequence identity to type A and type B viruses. More
importantly, it provided complete protection against LRTI by type A and type RSV viruses in
animal models. The vaccine candidate did not cause vaccine enhanced disease. In this
submission, we propose to further develop this promising vaccine candidate through process and
analytical method development, evaluation of the vaccine candidate in maternal immunization
and aged cotton rat models, and conducting GLP toxicology study. The proposed work will
provide a critical foundation to move the G protein-based RSV vaccine candidate toward clinical
study."
10907732,"ABSTRACT (Project 1)
Plexiform neurofibromas (PNF) are a hallmark manifestation of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) that affect up to
50% of patients and causes lifelong morbidity. A subset of PNF progress to atypical neurofibroma (ANF) and/or
malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST). These treatment refractory sarcomas represent the
leading cause of death in NF1 patients. Clinical genomic studies and novel genetically engineered mouse
(GEM) models, led and developed by Project 1 investigators, have provided strong evidence that loss of
CDKN2A (INK4A) and/or its alternate reading frame (ARF) is a key driver event in the majority of NF1-
associated ANF and MPNST. These models will serve as tractable platforms for characterizing key events in
the evolution of PNF to MPNST, and for preclinical evaluation of novel experimental therapeutics.
Our studies to date have identified the first two broadly clinically effective drugs for PNF, the MEK inhibitor,
selumetinib, and the multi-RTK inhibitor, cabozantinib. Mechanistic insights from preclinical models and initial
phase 2 trials showed that selumetinib and cabozantinib have distinct pharmacodynamic characteristics, in
both the molecular targets within neoplastic Schwann cells as well as the tumor microenvironment.
Collectively, these results suggest that combining these two drugs may enhance efficacy in PNF, and perhaps
impede the progression to ANF and MPNST. The heterozygous NF1 mutant tumor microenvironment is
essential in PNF development, and thus is a key consideration for implementing more effective combination
therapies. Although collagen and other extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins are primary constituents of the PNF
microenvironment, their respective roles in tumor initiation and maintenance remain unexplored.
To inform ongoing translational efforts to develop novel therapies for NF1 patients affected by tumors across
the PNF-ANF-MPNST continuum, we will accomplish the following: (1) Identify actionable therapeutic targets
within NF1+/- fibroblasts and ECM proteins of the tumor microenvironment that interact with neoplastic
Schwann cells to accelerate PNF formation and maintenance; (2) Extend preclinical studies in novel GEM and
PDX models to investigate potential synergism of therapeutic combinations (including MEKi, BETi, SHP-2, and
cabozantinib) in treating existing PNF, ANF and MPNST as well as in preventing malignant transformation of
precursor lesions; (3) Conduct an early phase clinical trial of MEKi and cabozantinb combination therapy in
PNF that may extend to more advanced nerve sheath tumors (ANF and MPNST) as informed by ongoing
preclinical studies; (4) Leverage state-of-the-art technologies in Omics (Core B) and Biospecimen/Pathology
(Core C) to define adaptive responses of PNF, ANF, and MPNST in GEM models as well as patient biopsy
specimens by evaluation of the genome, transcriptome, and functionally enriched kinome before and after
treatment."
10907738,"ABSTRACT (Project 2)
Our central hypothesis is that NF1 mutant gliomas constitute a distinct glioma subgroup with a unique
molecular pathogenesis, tumor microenvironment, and tumor cell vulnerabilities. Our approach includes a
variety of glioma models, including GEMs, patient-derived xenografts (PDX), primary cultures, and human
tumor biopsies. We will consider both germline and somatic NF1 silencing, and also build upon the
considerable recent progress with targeting NF1 associated tumorigenesis in other organ systems (Projects 1
and 3) to maximize the translational impact of this work. To develop NF1 genotype-specific hypotheses,
syngeneic GEM and derived GBM primary cultures are our first choice for discovery aspects of cell intrinsic
properties, as well as the immune microenvironment and first line therapeutic testing. We will exploit mouse
models developed by us that spontaneously develop GBM with full penetrance by inactivating three key tumor
suppressor genes in this disease (NF1, Tp53 and Pten) and engineered to mimic germline versus somatic NF1
driven disease. In one setting the mice harbor a heterozygous germline NF1 mutation (NF1-/flox or -/+), whereas
in the other setting the mice will develop only somatic NF1 mutations (NF1flox/+ or NF1flox/flox). Mice that develop
GBM due to mutations in the QKi, Tp53 and Pten genes (QPP mice) will serve as controls in these
experiments and represent the subgroup of NF1 wild type GBM. Primary cultures and expanded tumor
allografts will be used for in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies. Since the genetic complexity of sporadic GBM
in humans is not adequately represented in GEM, we will confirm and extend key results in PDX models that
vary in genotypes but for which the NF1 gene is either mutated or wildtype. NF1 mutant and NF1 wild type
patient derived orthotopic xenografts (PDX) developed at MSKCC will be studied in alignment with Projects 1
and 3, to test NF1/Ras pathway-tailored and other therapies that have emerged in the field. Human tumor
samples are most relevant for assessment of immune infiltration and will be examined in context of the unique
clinical presentation of patients with germline NF1 GBM. Aim 3 will focus on the systematic clinical annotation
of patients with germline NF1 GBM paired with detailed histologic and molecular analysis of routinely collected
formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded tumor biopsies from people with NF1 associated GBM. These studies
will be performed in collaboration with Core C (Biospecimen/Pathology) and will be used to validate key results
regarding NF1 associated characteristics of the TME. We will collaborate with Core B (Omics) to perform
detailed genomic and proteomic characterization of samples from GEM, PDX and human tissue to identify
actionable signaling pathways specifically in NF1 mutant GBM. A patient-facing portal will be created to recruit
and systemically document the clinical presentation and course of NF1 associated GBM to allow integration of
histologic, molecular and clinical data for NF1 driven gliomas across GEM and PEX preclinical models and
people with NF1 GBM."
10907741,"Abstract (Project 3)
Children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) are predisposed to juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia(JMML),
an aggressive myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) for which the standard of care is hematopoietic stem cell
transplant (HSCT). Unfortunately, relapse rates are high after HSCT, particularly in NF1 patients. We
discovered that NF1 functions as a tumor suppressor gene in hematopoietic cells and showed that NF1
inactivation results in deregulated Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling. This work suggested a central role of
hyperactive Ras signaling in JMML pathogenesis, and our group and others subsequently identified
mutations in other Ras pathway genes including NRAS, KRAS, PTPN11, and CBL. Ras pathway mutations
are invariably present at high allelic frequency at both diagnosis and relapse. Progression to acute myeloid
leukemia (AML) occurs in 20-30% of JMML patients and is frequently associated with outgrowth of
subclones that harbor secondary mutations, most commonly in SETBP1 or SH2B3. Consistent with the
molecular genetics of JMML, using the Mx1-Cre transgene to inactivate the conditional mutant Nf1flox allele
generated or to express oncogenic KrasG12D or NrasG12D in hematopoietic cells induces a JMML-like MPN in
mice. We utilized these genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models to perform preclinical trials and
observed remarkable efficacy of MEK inhibitors in Kras and Nf1 mutant mice with MPN. During this initial
cycle of SPORE funding, we opened a national phase 2 clinical trial of the MEK inhibitor trametinib for
patients with relapsed/refractory JMML (ADVL1521) and have observed objective responses in patients
treated to date. Enrollment is ongoing and we are collaborating with Cores B (Omics) and C (Pathology) to
perform correlative molecular and pathologic analyses. We also developed sensitive and reproducible
assays for monitoring molecular responses during the current funding period that we deployed to address
additional translational research questions. Finally, we collaborated with colleagues in Europe and Japan to
identify global DNA methylation as a novel biomarker of outcome with the most hypermethylated samples
portending the worst prognosis independent of genotype. We will extend these novel observations through
the following aims: Aim 1. To conduct innovative clinical trials for patients with JMML that emanate from our
laboratory and preclinical studies. We will complete the ongoing ADVL1521 trial and have developed the
first interventional risk-stratified clinical trial in newly diagnosed JMML; and, Aim 2. To perform biologic and
preclinical studies of promising therapies in JMML patient specimens and GEM models to inform clinical
translation. Our overall goal is to develop more effective and less toxic therapies for infants and children
with JMML by targeting the underlying molecular pathogenesis. These studies also have implications for the
fundamental problem of improving the treatment of other cancers driven by hyperactive Ras signaling."
10907743,"ABSTRACT – DEVELOPMENTAL REARCH PROGRAM
The DHART SPORE Developmental Research Program (DRP) will support innovative pilot projects to advance
the diagnosis and treatment of early stage tumors and advanced cancers characterized by germline and
somatic NF1 mutations. The DRP will accomplish this goal by supporting rigorous translational research in the
areas of population science, therapeutics, and mechanisms of disease. We expect that many established
investigators will utilize DRP support to launch new research endeavors and to generate preliminary data in
NF1 and RASopathy-associated cancers leading to successful grant applications to the NIH, the Department
of Defense NF Research Program, and other funding agencies. The ultimate goal of the DRP is to advance
high level research activities related to NF1-associated tumors, which we will achieve by recruiting and
supporting established investigators developing a new research theme in the field of NF1-related cancers. The
translational studies supported by the DRP also have the potential to replace SPORE projects that have been
completed or are not progressing satisfactorily toward achieving their objectives. This SPORE also includes a
Career Enhancement Program (CEP) for young investigators, which is described in a separate section of this
application. The institutions participating in the DHART SPORE renewal have committed a total of $1.65
million to support the Developmental Programs of the DHART SPORE (inclusive of the DRP and CEP).
Investigators from any DHART SPORE center can apply for DRP funds. In addition, we actively solicit
applications from non-SPORE investigators and institutions. The specific aims of the DRP are: (1) to fund
promising projects in order to generate preliminary data for grant applications to the NIH or other federal
funding agencies. The DRP emphasizes supporting the recruitment of investigators from historically
disenfranchised racial, ethnic, sexual orientation and disability groups that are under-represented in health
sciences, hereafter termed underrepresented minority (URM) investigators ; (2) to support the development of
new techniques and resources that can be applied to advance translational research to improve the treatment
of NF1-associated tumors; (3) to expand the scope of research in NF1, including funding high risk/high reward
projects; and, (4) to recruit talented investigators into NF1 research as it relates to cancer, and to promote new
collaborations in this field across a range of investigators and disciplines. The DRP will provide evaluation,
funding, and oversight for pilot projects. Each project will receive a minimum of $50,000 with a maximum of
$75,000 per year, with the potential for a single renewal. Applications for DRP support (including requests for a
second year of funding) will be evaluated through a competitive process with review by a Developmental
Programs Steering Committee (DPSC) comprised of senior scientists participating in this SPORE and
oversight and guidance from the External and Internal Advisory Boards."

research related to the goal of implementing more effective and less toxic therapies for cancers characterized
by NF1/Ras. The multi-institutional nature of this SPORE leverages a large and talented pool of early career
faculty from multiple disciplines. Each institution views the CEP as a vehicle for recruiting and advancing the
careers of early stage translational scientists. Collectively, they have committed $1.3 million to the current
award and $1.65 million to the renewal to support the Developmental Programs of the DHART SPORE (CEP
and DRP). The Specific Aims of the CEP are to: (1) support early stage investigators as they develop
innovative research programs that contribute new knowledge to NF1-related cancer research while generating
preliminary data that will allow successful future independent extramural funding; (2) provide early stage
researchers with training that will equip them with essential skills and knowledge for success as independent
investigators; and, (3) mentor early stage translational researchers through regularly scheduled one-on-one
mentor meetings and a structured Individual Development Program (IDP) to facilitate integration into the fabric
of the SPORE. The CEP has a special emphasis on supporting the recruitment of underrepresented minority
investigators (URM). The DHART SPORE will link vertically and horizontally with diversity programs at all of
the consortium institutions and ensure maximum exposure of the CEP mentorship and funding opportunities to
URM across the seven DHART SPORE sites. Further, requests for applications (RFA) will be shared with
Historically Black Colleges and Universities and professional organizations representing communities under-
represented in biomedical science. RFAs are already sent outside of the DHART SPORE sites via the
Children’s Tumor Foundation and Neurofibromatosis Therapeutic Acceleration Program. We are expanding
this recruitment effort to include the Society for Neuro-Oncology, RASopathies Network USA, the Children’s
Oncology Group. The goal is to fund two CEP proposals per year ($50,000 - $75,000/proposal). Requests for
applications will be announced twice a year via broad communications to all groups listed above to maximize
opportunities for recruitment of diverse scientists and science. CEP opportunities will also be highlighted at
professional meetings throughout the year. Applications for CEP support will be evaluated through a
competitive process with review by a Developmental Programs Steering Committee comprised of senor

quality of life and decrease unscheduled physician visits, emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and possibly,
mortality. Despite the well documented efficacy, hospital-based rehab remains inadequate due to insufficient
access, acceptance and sustainability. This has triggered a growing interest in home-based rehab programs.
Patients enrolled in home-based programs, however, may exercise at low intensities to avoid dyspnea/fatigue,
limiting the potential benefits of exercise training. Accordingly, it is essential to develop innovative home-based
programs that decrease exercise-induced dyspnea and fatigue while ensuring sufficient exercise intensity to
produce sustainable physiologic benefit. Recent data suggest that rhythmically enhanced stimulation (RAS)
using music may constitute such an innovative strategy. Music can diminish exercise-induced dyspnea/fatigue
allowing patients to tolerate more challenging physical activity and obtain a greater benefit from rehab. Music
also can induce entrainment of motor responses such as walking. We thus plan to capitalize on both the
sensorimotor coupling of gait with RAS-enhanced music and the mitigating effect of music over exercise-induced
dyspnea/fatigue. Specifically, we propose to compare the efficacy of a 12-week, home-based exercise program
augmented by patient-tailored, RAS-enhanced music to a 12-week traditional home-based exercise program in
patients with COPD. Hypothesis: (H1) Compared to patients randomized to a home-based, exercise program
without music (control group), patients randomized to a home-based, exercise program augmented with RAS-
enhanced music (intervention group) will demonstrate (H1a, primary hypothesis) greater increase in 6-minute
walk distance, (H1b) greater increase in walking time on a constant-load treadmill test protocol, (H1c) reduced
dyspnea during a constant-load treadmill test protocol, and (H1d) greater increases in health-related quality of
life. In addition (H2), they will accumulate greater volume of physical activity (actigraphy) and (H3) will better
sustain these benefits over time. Lastly (Explorative Objective), we will assess the mechanistic impact
physiological and psychological phenotype and clinical factors on responsiveness to rehabilitation (duration
constant-load treadmill test) achieved with and without concurrent use of RAS-music. Methods: The proposed
study is a randomized, controlled clinical trial in which 170 patients will be randomized into a home-based,
exercise program without music or a home-based exercise program augmented with RAS-enhanced music.
Patients will receive 12-weeks of home-based training per group assignment (at least three times weekly) followed
by 12-weeks of follow-up to assess the sustainability of our novel intervention. Testing will be carried out at
baseline and at 6, 12 and 24 weeks. Testing will include pulmonary function test, 6-minute walk tests, constant-
load treadmill test, physical activity quantification, measurements of dyspnea, quality of life, and objective
quantification of quadriceps dimensions (ultrasonography) and strength/fatigue (magnetic stimulation of the
femoral nerve). Analysis: In the principal analysis of the primary outcome measure (6-minute walk distance) we
will use a mixed-model analysis that includes treatment, time and treatment-by-time interaction terms. This
model will automatically account for missing data—where missing at random is assumed. We will conduct a
sensitivity analysis based on the results of the mixed model analysis to determine which other assumptions
regarding missing data might produce different results. One component of the sensitivity analysis will include
adjustment for baseline demographic and health covariates. A linear regression model and a mixed model
ANOVA will be used to assess the impact of clinical confounders (Explorative Objective). Scientific
contribution: These data will provide a solid foundation to determine the physiologic impact of our rehab
strategy. This innovative, practical and economical pulmonary rehabilitation strategy has the potential to create
a paradigm shift in the care of the many veterans with COPD who have no access to pulmonary rehabilitation."

10835099,"ABSTRACT
Dysregulated overexpression and hyperactivation of Wnt/-catenin signaling is found in >20% of all cancers and
in 50% of breast cancer, particularly triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Yet despite extensive efforts to inhibit
Wnt/-catenin signaling, no drugs that target the Wnt pathway have been approved, mainly due to the inability
of inhibitors drugs to separate oncogenic from homeostatic functions of -catenin. BCL9 is a transcriptional co-
activator that regulates oncogenic β-catenin-mediated gene transactivation. Its overexpression enhances Wnt/β-
catenin signaling, resulting in cell proliferation, migration and invasiveness in vitro, and induces tumor initiation
and progression in vivo. Genetic ablation of Bcl9/Bcl9l in mouse intestinal epithelium reduces tumor growth
without phenotypic abnormalities. Therefore, specific antagonism of the interaction of β-catenin with BCL9 is
hypothesized to prove a safe and efficacious strategy for cancer therapy.
Sapience Therapeutics sought to develop a -catenin antagonist peptide, designed to interact with -catenin.
Our approach introduces amino acid (AA) substitutions to the native HD2 binding domain sequence to enhance
target affinity and includes a short cell penetrating domain (CPD) for intracellular entry. Additionally, to overcome
challenges encountered by traditional peptides, Sapience’s peptides include D-enantiomer AAs (D-AAs), which
dramatically increase stability and bioavailability, while reducing potential immunogenicity.
Through extensive structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies, we screened a library of peptides designed to
disrupt β-catenin’s oncogenic association with BCL9 and selected ST316 as the lead candidate. ST316 displays
potent and selective inhibition of Wnt signaling and induction of cytotoxicity in tumor cells dependent on Wnt
signaling (but not Wnt-independent tumors). Further, ST316 demonstrates stability, superior bioavailability and
solubility and in vivo potency. In Phase I of this SBIR, ST316 demonstrated nanomolar binding affinity to β-
catenin and a low micromolar (2.7µM) EC50 value for inhibition of β-catenin transcriptional activity in vitro. Safety
studies with no histopathological findings at 50mg/kg suggested a therapeutic window of at least 10x.
Following this proof of concept, this Phase II application proposes rigorous IND-enabling toxicology and phar-
macology studies to support clinical development of ST316. Specific Aim #1 will determine the first-in-human
(FIH) ST316 dose by identifying the no adverse effect level (NOAEL) in rats and highest non-severely toxic dose
(HNSTD) in minipigs in 28-day repeat dose GLP toxicity studies. In Specific Aim #2, we propose a series of
experiments to determine the ST316 pharmacologic active dose (PAD) in mouse patient-derived xenograft (PDX)
models, and identify pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers associated with the PAD, which can be used clinically
to assess ST316 activity. The PAD will then be used in Specific Aim #3 to evaluate the impact of ST316 on the
tumor immune microenvironment (TME), namely macrophage polarization, tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL)
expression in tumors and the impact of combination with a PD-1 inhibitor."
10886627,"PROJECT SUMMARY
40% of the population over the age of 60 experiences a rotator cuff tear. The high failure rates of rotator cuff tear
after surgical repair or non-surgical treatment make it a major clinical challenge. The outcome failures
accompany the formation of scar tissues at the tendon-to-bone insertion (tendon enthesis) with disorganized
architecture and deteriorated function. Development of effective therapeutics has been hampered by limited
knowledge of enthesis development biology and mechanobiology and an incomplete understanding of
endogenous mechanisms governing enthesis pathogenesis and healing. To bridge this knowledge gap, the
current proposal seeks to elucidate how tendon enthesis responds to its mechanical and biochemical
environment during development and healing processes. It is known that a combination of mechanical force and
distinct pathways, including hedgehog (Hh) signaling, drive enthesis formation, promote remodeling of mature
enthesis, and affect enthesis healing. Recently, our studies have indicated that the primary cilium, a solitary
antenna protruding from mammalian cell surface, potentially functions as a hub for mechanotransduction and
Hh signaling. Building on our previous work, the objective of this proposal is to gain a mechanistic understanding
of the role of primary cilia in concentrating and synchronizing mechanical and Hh signals during enthesis
development and healing. To achieve this objective, we will determine identities and activities of ciliated enthesis
cells during enthesis development and mechanical adaptation (Specific Aim 1) and evaluate the regenerative
capacity of ciliated enthesis cells for improving enthesis healing (Specific Aim 2). The approaches we will use
include cilia-labeled and cilia-deleted transgenic mouse models, different established loading models, cell
transplantation, and transcriptomics analysis, combined with structural, compositional, and biomechanical
evaluation assays. At the conclusion of this project, we expect to identify new cilia-regulated mechano-
transduction pathways during in vivo enthesis mechanical adaptation and suggest novel mechanisms by which
cilia convert mechanical cues to cellular signaling events. The new findings of the role of primary cilia in enthesis
healing will guide the development of novel pharmacological and mechanobiology therapeutics for treating
rotator cuff tears."

are neurotoxic, which limits their therapeutic dosage and often results in impaired cognition during and after

therapeutics for AIDs may contribute to HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorder (HAND). Accordingly, Vala
Sciences Inc., proposes a Fast-Track SBIR project to develop an assay system utilizing neurons, astrocytes,
and microglia, derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-neurons/astrocytes/microglia) to test
candidate therapeutics for neurotoxicity. The cells will be cultured in 384-well dishes to enable high throughput
multiplexed assay of compound effects on neuronal activity (via Kinetic Image Cytometry [KIC] –
acquisition/analysis of videos of cells labeled with calcium and voltage indicators), and synapses, mitochondria,
endoplasmic reticulum, and cell viability. Since the assay will feature human cells, it will likely be more predictive
of human neurotoxicity vs. animal test systems currently used in preclinical research. Phase I activities will
develop the multiplexed system, to enable testing of compounds for toxic effects on mechanisms of action (MOA)
including alteration of plasma membrane ion channels, ER function and integrity, mitochondrial function, and
neuronal circuitry (correlated activity of neurons within a culture well). A total of 30 compounds with known MOA
and effects of humans, will be tested in Phase I, these data will be used to train artificial intelligence (AI) clustering
algorithms to recognize the MoAs, particularly for low doses of the test agents. The compounds will also be
tested on hiPSC-neurons/astrocytes/microglia representing APOE-3/4 and APOE-4/4 genotypes, as the
APOE-4 is associated increased neurotoxicity. In Phase II a total of 350 probes/drugs (of which 275 are known
to have clinical effects, and 75 will be expected to have no effect) will be screened, with the results used to
further train the AI and improve the overall clinical predictivity. Additional versions of the assay will be developed
featuring mutations/genotypes relevant to Alzheimer’s Disease and Bipolar Disease. In addition to recognition
of neurotoxicity, the assay system also will increase our understanding of neuronal circuits, which is responsive
to the BRAIN Initiative program. The neurotoxicity assay will be marketed to pharmaceutical companies
developing therapeutics across a broad spectrum of diseases/afflictions, including chemotherapeutics and
potential therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases."
10907734,"Exposures to phosgene (COCl2) and phosphorous trichloride (PCl3) are public health threats. COCl2 and PCl3
exposures are the result of industrial accidents or chemical warfare/terrorism acts. Following exposures, acute
lung injury presenting as apnea and pulmonary edema are major concerns, which contribute to mortality and
morbidity. However, mechanisms responsible for the action of these pulmonary toxic agents have not been
elucidated. Both COCl2 and PCl3 rapidly produce HCl in the lung. Plasmalogen phospholipids including
plasmenylethanolamine (pPE) in the lung are acid-labile leading to the production of lipidic aldehydes and
lysophosphatidylethanolamine containing polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA-LPE). In addition to COCl2 and PCl3
reacting with the vinyl ether bond of plasmalogens, other functional groups of lipids may also be targeted. These
include primary amines and conjugated dienes suggesting that an array of lipophilic compounds is produced
during exposures. Functional groups of proteins and metabolites may also be modified by COCl2 and PCl3
exposures leading to metabolic alterations. Extensive discovery omics analyses following exposures to COCl2
and PCl3 will provide critical insights into mechanisms responsible for their toxicity. We hypothesize that both
COCl2 and PCl3 exposures result in lipid and metabolic changes leading to endothelial and epithelial cell
dysfunction. Both targeted and untargeted approaches will be performed to identify novel lipidic and metabolic
changes following COCl2 and PCl3 exposures. In support of this hypothesis, pilot data show: 1) PUFA-LPE levels
are elevated in response to PCl3 exposure to primary human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVEC); 2)
PUFA-LPE elicits HLMVEC barrier dysfunction; 3) COCl2 exposure to lung lipids results in the production of a
family of lipophilic aldehydes and 4) PCl3 elicits profound changes in HLMVEC metabolites and metabolic
pathways following exposure. There are two specific aims for the proposed studies. Specific Aim 1 will
identify novel lipid and metabolic products following COCl2 and PCl3 exposures resulting in endothelial and
epithelial cell dysfunction. Specific Aim 2 will identify mechanisms by which novel lipid and metabolic species
produced following COCl2 and PCl3 exposures elicit endothelial and epithelial cell dysfunction.
We will investigate COCl2 and PCl3 exposures to both primary human lung microvascular endothelial cells and
primary human small airway epithelial cells. This, together with testing these two distinct toxicants at LD50 levels,
meet criteria for this RFA. The proposed studies will examine a potential common mechanism for COCl2 and
PCl3 toxicity mediated by PUFA-LPE. Additionally, unique lipid and metabolic changes will be examined following
COCl2 and PCl3 exposures using untargeted analytical approaches. Collectively, these studies will provide in-
sights into the mechanisms responsible for toxicity and will provide therapeutic targets for the development of
countermeasures to COCl2 and PCl3."

Age-related hearing loss is one of the most common conditions in the elderly. Many genetic factors for hearing
loss have been identified, but many more remain to be identified; and our lack of knowledge about the
mechanisms by which they cause hearing loss is a barrier that must be overcome if we are to develop methods
for preventing (or reversing) age-related hearing loss. No model organism has contributed more than the
laboratory mouse to improving human health, and mouse models have shaped our understanding of the
mammalian auditory system. Mice with genetic mutations have been used to identify genes that are critical for
auditory function, and for characterizing human genetic factors that cause hearing loss.
A spontaneous hearing loss with an oligogenic basis develops in several well-studied inbred mouse strains
(A/J, DBA/2J, MA/My, NOD/LtJ, NOR/LtJ, C57BR/cdJ, C57L/J). Our recently developed AI-based
computational pipeline (GNNHap) identified four causative genetic factors for spontaneous hearing loss in
three strains (A/J, DBA/2, NOD/LtJ). However, to accelerate the pace of genetic discovery for hearing loss, this
project will enhance our AI by enabling it to analyze structural variant alleles present in the genomes of inbred
strains, and by adding three computational capabilities for prioritizing candidate genes. The enhanced AI will
be able to: (i) determine if alleles within the human homologues of identified mouse candidate genes were
associated with hearing loss in human GWAS; (ii) analyze a phenotypic database to determine if a mouse line
with a knockout of a candidate gene has impaired hearing; and (iii) analyze gene expression data in the Gene
Expression Analysis Resource (gEAR) to determine whether identified candidate murine genes (and their
human homologues) are expressed in the ear. The enhanced computational tool will then be used to identify
genetic factors for hearing loss in four strains (MA/My, NOR/LtJ, C57BR/cdJ, C57L/J). Since it is critical to
characterize genetic effector mechanisms, state of the art genome engineering is used to generate knockin
(KI) mice, which have a reversion of a causative genetic factor for hearing loss to wild type. A detailed
evaluation of these KI mice is performed to characterize the individual (and combined) effect of these
mutations on hearing loss and cochlear morphology. Characterization of their genetic effector mechanisms will
reveal how a set of interacting oligogenic factors produce a spontaneous hearing loss. As a stretch goal, we
will use some of these KI mice to determine if we can develop a novel gene x environment model for noise-
induced hearing loss."

The University of Pennsylvania's Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology reflects a long tradition of
excellence in clinical and translational research. In this application, information is provided on the obstetrical
service and proven track record for conducting clinical trials at two hospitals in the University of Pennsylvania
(Penn) Health System – the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania (HUP) and Pennsylvania Hospital
(PAH). Each year, approximately 9,500 patients are delivered at Penn, and many of these patients have high-
risk pregnancies. The obstetric population at Penn has a diverse racial and ethnic background, which is an
important asset for enrollment in Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units (MFMU) Network studies. Key assets of the
MFMU Network site at Penn are: 1) an experienced Nurse Coordinator who oversees all the clinical studies; 2)
a second registered nurse who is critical for completion of complicated Network studies (e.g., PACT, PASC-
PREG); 3) a biospecimens technician who has written manuals of operation and oversees collection,
processing, and data banking for biospecimens; 4) successful outpatient recruitment at all major clinical sites
at HUP and PAH; 5) the ability to expand to a 24/7 model that provides coverage on the labor and delivery
units at HUP and PAH; 6) data abstraction manuals for each MFMU Network study that ensure accurate
ascertainment of clinical data from the electronic medical record; and 7) support by the MFM Research
Program and the Women's Health Clinical Research Center at Penn, which assist the MFMU Network team
with recruitment of new staff, onboarding, regulatory affairs, and good clinical practices in all research
operations. The MFMU Network research team works closely with the Neonatal Research Network clinical
center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia to provide neonatal follow-up for MFMU Network studies. The
investigative team for the MFMU Network clinical center at Penn has substantial experience directing
multicenter studies, and each investigator has an exciting research agenda that adds unique perspectives to
the MFMU Network. The investigators propose three specific aims for this application: 1) Develop and
implement MFMU Network protocols, including recruitment, study interventions, and follow-up
examinations; 2) Provide the highest quality data for MFMU Network studies and provide these data in
a timely fashion; and 3) Collaborate with the other MFMU Network centers to identify areas for potential
research and to analyze and publish studies performed by the MFMU Network. The investigative team at
Penn has built a highly successful MFMU Network clinical site that will support the NICHD's guiding principles
shaping the 21st century landscape for multi-site clinical research, including enhanced rigor for selecting
studies, availability of Network infrastructure to a wider range of investigators, data sharing and access to
biospecimens, and inclusion of diverse populations in Network studies."
10930922,"Project Summary
HPV mediated oropharynx cancer (HPVOPC) is projected to increase in incidence in the United States over the
next 20 years. Attempts to de-escalate nonsurgical treatment for HPVOPC have not been successful and current
treatment regimens incur significant long-term morbidity. Recently, PD-1 inhibitors received approval as first line
therapy for recurrent/metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (r/mHNSCC), achieving ~15-20%
overall response rates. However, PD-1 inhibition has demonstrated no benefit in patients with previously
untreated, locally advanced HPVOPC/HNSCC, and emerging neoadjuvant window of opportunity trials
examining PD-1 inhibition have documented only modest response. Targeting stereotactic body radiation
(SBRT) to the tumor while sparing the tumor draining lymphatics may increase the response to PD-1 inhibition
as part of a novel rational therapeutic strategy. In support of this hypothesis, we have shown that ablating tumor-
draining lymphatics blocks the response to PD-1 inhibition and that elective nodal irradiation attenuates antitumor
immunity and T cell infiltration in multiple experimental HNSCC model systems. In addition, we found that early,
but not delayed, lymphatic ablation blocks the response to combined SBRT and PD-1 inhibition, indicating that
an immunologically competent draining lymph node bed is critical to mount effective antitumor immunity after
PD-1 inhibition. We explored this premise in our recent Phase 1 clinical trial in resectable HNSCC patients who
received nivolumab in combination with SBRT to gross tumor volume (GTV), followed by definitive surgical
resection (NCT03247712). Astonishingly, the pathologic complete response rate in HPV+ patients was 90% and
no patient required adjuvant radiation or chemoradiation. In addition, the combination of a CD47 inhibitor
(evorpacept) with PD-1 inhibition shows enhanced response compared to PD-1 inhibition alone in both preclinical
models and in r/mHNSCC. Our overall hypothesis is that preserving the immune-lymphatic axis during
neoadjuvant immunoradiotherapy (NIRT) for HPVOPC will promote anti-tumor immunity, potentiate checkpoint
blockade therapy and reinstate effective cancer immunosurveillance. Therefore, we propose a phase IIb, single
arm clinical trial of neoadjuvant 8Gy x 3 SBRT to GTV followed by combination evorpacept and pembrolizumab
in patients with previously untreated locally advanced, resectable HPVOPC, followed by risk adapted adjuvant
therapy. We specifically hypothesize that combination neoadjuvant SBRT and evorpacept + pembrolizumab will
1) provide >80% complete/major pathologic response in patients with resectable HPVOPC, 2) is safe and will
result in functional and quality of life metrics that are similar or better to those for patients treated with standard
therapy, and 3) enhance cytotoxic CD8 T cell antitumor immunity by driving the priming and expansion of tumor-
reactive T cells along the tumor-immune-lymphatic axis. A high pathologic response rate and favorable
toxicity profile in the proposed trial will support a subsequent paradigm-shifting, randomized phase II
trial comparing nonsurgical treatment with SBRT to GTV followed by immunotherapy versus standard
of care radiation with concurrent cytotoxic chemotherapy."

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) plays important roles in human health ranging from vascular biology to tissue
regeneration. To advance investigations into roles, researchers often use H2S donors to directly modulate sulfide
levels during experiments. Despite this broad utility, key unmet needs remain that will be addressed in this
proposal. The long-term goal of this research is to develop and deploy COS/H2S donors to investigate and
advance the multifaceted roles of reactive sulfur species related to human health. The overall objectives of this
proposal are to broaden the platform of COS/H2S releasing motifs, to understand how different CA isoforms
impact COS to H2S conversion, and to apply COS/H2S donors to in vivo models of bone regeneration. The
rationale for these studies is that the functional tools for COS/H2S delivery and a greater understanding of
differential CA isoform activity toward COS hydrolysis will enable future applications in which COS/H2S release
is targeted to systems where key CA isoforms are present and H2S is known to play a protective effect. The
proposed investigations include three specific aims: (1) Expansion, refinement, and application of COS/H2S
releasing platforms; (2) Investigation in to the differential CA isoform activity toward COS hydrolysis; and (3)
Application of COS/H2S donors to bone regeneration. This proposal builds from prior work establishing that COS
releasing molecules can function as H2S donors due to the rapid enzymatic conversion of COS to H2S by
carbonic anhydrase (CA). In Aim 1, new chemical approaches are used to enable COS/H2S delivery, expand the
dynamic range and palette of traceable COS/H2S donors, and provide amplified release. In Aim 2, the hydrolytic
activity of individual CA isoforms toward COS and model thioester/thionoester substrates are investigated to
understand isoform differences in CA efficiency toward COS hydrolysis. In Aim 3, the developed COS/H2S
donors are used to investigate the role of H2S in cell and animal models of bone regeneration. This approach is
innovative because it provides new approaches to COS/H2S delivery that address key unmet needs in the field
and provides the first insights into the differential activity of CA isoforms for COS to H2S conversion. Moreover,
the proposed applications in bone regeneration are innovative because they not only leverage the protective
effects of H2S and high local activity of CA during osteogenesis, but also leverages the underutilized connection
of H2S with Ca2+ recruitment in osteoclasts. The proposed research is significant because it provides new
approaches that directly address key limitations in the field, including amplified release systems, trackable
donors, and analyte replacement methodologies. In addition, the proposed research provides the first insights
into CA isoform differences for COS to H2S conversion, which will be leveraged in model systems relevant to
human health in which both CA activity and H2S delivery are important. Successful completion of the proposed
Aims will provide a positive impact in the field of H2S biology and will result a greater understanding of the roles
of COS/H2S in human health."
10911161,"The long-term objectives of this application are to establish the epidemiological association between
methamphetamine use and pulmonary arterial hypertension. Methamphetamine and other stimulant abuse
have been increasing across the United States and the world with several known complications. Pulmonary
arterial hypertension has been suspected to occur as a sequela, however this has never been studied in a
rigorous multicenter epidemiologic study. Preliminary findings have suggested that carboxylesterase 1 (CES1)
may be an important genetic modifier in the setting of methamphetamine use leading to pulmonary arterial
hypertension. The Specific Aims are 1) to determine whether methamphetamine use is associated with PAH in
a case-control study and whether this association is modified by genetic variants in (or activity of) CES1; 2) to
determine the risk factors for clinical worsening in patients with methamphetamine-associated pulmonary
arterial hypertension in comparison with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension in a prospective cohort
study; and 3) to understand if reductions in CES1 activity result in human pulmonary endothelial cell damage in
methamphetamine-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension. Patient-oriented research studies will be
conducted in a multicenter study group to address these epidemiologic questions."
10909148,"Considerable variability in tumor-associated immune responses exists across racial/ethnic populations.
These variations may explain part of the observed disparities in response to cancer therapies, particularly
immunotherapy, and treatment outcomes. In colorectal cancer (CRC), the intensity and composition of tumor
infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) are established prognostic and predictive indicators. However, factors
contributing to the diversity of TIL responses observed among CRCs remain largely unknown, and the
influence of race/ethnicity and genetic ancestry have been underexplored. In a recent study comparing CRCs
from African Americans and non-Hispanic Whites, differences in lymphocytic reactions were observed to
partially explain the survival disparity between the two groups. No data is available for other racial/ethnic
groups. Prior research has also been limited by relying solely on self-reported race/ethnicity, a significant
limitation. Studies show that self-report does not fully or accurately reflect the genetic diversity present in
admixed minority populations. We hypothesize that ancestral genetic architecture is important for shaping
immune-related determinants of CRC outcomes given the differential efficiency of immune function observed
across racial/ethnic groups. Studies in the genertically admixed Latinx population offer notable advantages
including a unique opportunity to simultaneously tease out the contributions of multiple ancestral backgrounds
(e.g. African, European, Indigenous American) to variability in immune function. Here, we will test the
hypothesis that genetic ancestry is independently associated with differences in tumor-associated T cell
profiles that contribute to CRC outcome disparities (i.e. observed across populations defined by ethnicity and
by genetic ancestry) using existing resources from the Hispanic Colorectal Cancer Study, the Puerto Rico
Biobank, the Total Cancer Care Protocol, and the Molecular Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Study
. We
will address three aims: (1) quantify CRC-associated T cell profiles in Latinxs from diverse genetic ancestral
backgrounds using DNA- and protein-based approaches; (2) investigate the independent associations of
genetic ancestry, epidemiologic factors, and clinical variables with T cell profiles in the tumor
microenvironment of Latinx CRCs; and (3) compare CRC-associated T cell profiles between Latinx and NHW
populations. This study is unique in leveraging the ancestral diversity of Latinos to understand the
relationships between race/ethnicity, germline genetics, tumor immunobiology, and cancer disparities.
Results will provide new avenues for understanding immunological factors contributing to disproportionate
treatment response and mortality in diverse populations of patients with CRC."

Opioid abuse and related deaths are rising exponentially, with synthetic opioids dominating the recent increase
in overdoses. The Imaging and Neural Circuits Core (INCC) is ideally situated to collaborate across UW and the
broader NIDA research community by developing publicly available imaging and modern circuit neuroscience
resources, alongside unique training opportunities focused on the high-resolution investigation of opioid circuits
and neurons that play a role in naturalistic motivated behavior, drug seeking, stress, anhedonia, and
reinstatement/relapse. Here, we propose to continue the existing capabilities and expand our resources for
investigating single cells and circuits in motivation, drug-seeking, and opioid neurobiology by integrating cutting-
edge genetic, electrophysiological, and imaging technologies. The central goals of this proposal are to i) facilitate
2-photon imaging and simultaneous holographic optogenetics in awake and behaving animals; ii) generate an
experimental pipeline for single-cell gene expression profiling of intact tissue volumes; iii) develop
instrumentation and training protocols for high-resolution Neuropixels electrophysiology and to further enhance
existing fiber photometry, 1p calcium imaging, and optogenetics instrumentation. The continuation of the existing
INCC infrastructure will integrate leading animal models of motivated behavior, non-contingent and contingent
administration of opioids together with high-resolution neural circuit analysis to provide critical resources that
enhance and facilitate basic science and training in addiction research at the University of Washington and
partnered Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). This INCC proposal also includes the
expansion of cutting-edge high-density in vivo electrophysiology and light sheet microscopy coupled with
molecular feature identification pipelines. Together, the implementation of existing and new technologies in

10974016,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Midbrain dopamine (DA)-producing neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) play a critical role in
modulating reward-seeking behavior. VTA-DA neurons are functionally and genetically heterogeneous, and
genetic markers for neuropeptides and neuropeptide receptors can be used to isolate VTA subpopulations.
Though distinct neuropeptidergic pathways have been shown to potently modulate DA neurons, the
intracellular signaling pathways that act downstream of neuropeptide receptors are unknown. VTA-DA neurons
that express the Gq-protein coupled receptor, tachykinin receptor 3 (Tacr3), are a minimally sufficient
subpopulation of DA neurons that promote reward reinforcement behavior. Tacr3 activation has recently been
shown to be dependent on transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) channel signaling in the
hypothalamus. TRPC type 6 (TRPC6) channels are enriched in DA neurons and are activated by stimulation of
Gq-coupled receptor signaling. Therefore, I hypothesize that TRPC6 is likely the main type of TRPC channel in
VTA-DA neurons that acts downstream of Tacr3 activation. To establish the role of TRPC6 in regulating the
physiology and function of VTA-Tacr3 neurons, I propose to selectively mutate the Trpc6 gene to generate a
loss of function in a cell-type specific manner within the VTA of adult mice using an advanced CRISPR/Cas9
genetic technology. I will perform ex vivo slice electrophysiology and slice calcium imaging (Aim 1), as well as
in vivo recordings of calcium dynamics during a probabilistic discounting paradigm and progressive ratio
motivational task (Aim 2). Determining the function of TRPC6 in VTA-Tacr3 neurons will provide important
insights into the therapeutic potential of this understudied ion channel in the central nervous system."
10816554,"Project Summary
 Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAb) against HIV Env represent a novel class of antivirals that have the
potential to neutralize viral entry, while simultaneously activating non-neutralizing immune effector functions.
However, a major obstacle for their clinical use is identifying the virologically suppressed HIV+ patients that are
best suited for a given bNAb or bNAb combination. Indeed, early-stage therapeutic studies with bNAb have not
found uniform concordance between viral outgrowth assay sequences (in vitro) and the Env resistance
mutations that arise in treated patients in vivo. Our laboratory has developed robust and quantitative flow
cytometry-based assays for neutralization of both cell-free and cell-to-cell infection. We have observed
decreases in the potency and efficacy of Abs using cell-associated versus cell-free HIV-1 neutralization
assays. The detection of these cell-associated phenotypes may be particularly important for cure-based
approaches where functional reactivity of bNAbs against infected cells may be important for in vivo efficacy. To
overcome the limitations of PCR-first based approaches that often identify non-functional Env, we propose the
development of a single cell Viral Outgrowth Neutralization Assay (scVONA) that will be performed in the
presence and absence of bNAb. This scVONA will simultaneously quantify viral latent reservoir sequences and
determine their sensitivity to bNAb. To accomplish this, scVONAs will leverage and enhance a highly sensitive
single cell reporter cell line to detect infection and identify cells to test for neutralization of cell-to-cell spread.
The ultimate readout are single cell flow cytometry measures that enable capture of resistant env genes by
sorting and sequencing insensitive versus sensitive clones. Long read Env sequencing will be employed for
bioinformatic analyses to determine linked sequences that correlate with resistance. Titration of bNAb will also
provide estimated IC50 and sequences may allow a measure of the fraction of sensitive clones. We believe
that scVONA will provide a rapid <2 week readout of neutralization sensitivity and simultaneously provide a
measure of functionally intact env genes for confirmatory analyses, significantly reducing the time, cost and
labor associated with identifying bNAb resistant sequences from HIV+ patient samples."
10799693,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
The HIV-1 reservoir is thought to contain cells that vary in their susceptibility to clearance by the host immune
system. Identifying mechanisms that allow infected cells to avoid clearance could inform the development of cure
strategies that are able to more effectively eliminate HIV-infected cells in the long-lived reservoir. Persistence
during long periods of untreated infection, when immune surveillance for HIV-infected cells is highest and the
immune environment is highly inflammatory, may select for infected cells with an enhanced ability to evade
detection and clearance by the host immune system. This study will focus on two groups of reservoir cells that
carry intact proviral genomes and likely differ in susceptibly to clearance. The first are ""early"" reservoir cells that
were infected (or are a clone of a cell infected) early in untreated infection. The second are ""late"" reservoir cells
that were infected (or are a clone of a cell infected) near the time of ART initiation. These ""late"" reservoir cells
have persisted in the reservoir for less time and have primarily persisted during antiretroviral therapy when HIV-
specific immune responses are blunted and HIV-infected cells typically have very long half-lives. In contrast,
""early"" reservoir cells persisted for long periods of untreated infection when most HIV-infected cells have a short
half-life. We hypothesize that early proviruses will have epigenetic features that make them resistant to T cell
stimulation and less susceptible to clearance. In this study we will identify intact ""early"" and ""late"" proviruses in
CD4+ T cells isolated from the blood of 15 participants on suppressive ART (Aim 1a). We will then examine
phenotypes predicted to impact reservoir clearance. Specifically, we will examine whether ""early"" and ""late""
proviruses differ in their sensitivity to T cell stimulation (Aim 1b) and/or have different genetic (proviral sequence
and integration site) or epigenetic features (Aim 1c). To test the hypothesis that ""early"" proviruses are more
difficult to clear, we will measure the susceptibility of ""early"" and ""late"" proviruses to killing by autologous CD8 T
cells (Aim 2a) and assess whether disruption of epigenetic regulators alters their susceptibility to killing by
autologous CD8 T cells (Aim 2b). Our focus on ""early"" and ""late"" viruses allows us to explore potential
mechanisms associated with clearance in populations that likely differ in their susceptibility to clearance,
however, the proposal work will also reveal if features other than proviral age are predictive of susceptibility to
clearance. We will then explore strategies to improve antigen presentation in infected cells (Aim 3a) and assess
whether improved antigen presentation can enhance killing by autologous CD8 T cells in populations typically
refractory to clearance (Aim 3b). The overarching goal of this project is to define a population of cells with an
enhanced ability to evade clearance, identify host and proviral features associated with clearance evasion and
test whether better antigen presentation can make HIV-infected cells more susceptible to clearance. Successful
completion of these aims will connect proviral genetics and epigenetics to virus reactivation and killing to inform
the development of improved clearance strategies."

 Craniofacial development is a complex process that requires various signaling pathways to mediate
cross-talk between tissues that eventually differentiate into the cartilage and bone of the frontonasal skeleton.
Defects in this process result in common craniofacial malformations, such as cleft lip and palate. Signaling
through the platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs) plays a critical role in both human and mouse
craniofacial development. PDGFRa has been shown to play a predominant role in NCC migration, contribute
to proliferation of the facial mesenchyme at mid-gestation and promote osteoblast differentiation. Alternatively,
PDGFRb primarily regulates proliferation of the facial mesenchyme past mid-gestation. Further, PDGFRa and
PDGFRb have been shown to genetically and physically interact in the craniofacial mesenchyme to form
functional heterodimers, though the mechanism and function of signaling through these heterodimers remains
unknown. We have used an innovative approach, bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC), to
explore individual, activated PDGFR dimers, which has revealed preliminary differences in dimer-specific
activation, trafficking and downstream signaling dynamics. The goal of this proposal is to fully characterize
these dynamics for PDGFRa/b heterodimers in vitro and in vivo, and to identify PDGFR dimer-specific
interacting proteins that mediate differential trafficking of the various PDGFR dimers. First, PDGFRa/b
heterodimers will be immunoprecipitated using a GFP-Trap nanobody in response to a timecourse of PDGF-
BB ligand stimulation to examine the dimerization and autophosphorylation dynamics of PDGFRa/b
heterodimers. Then, fluorescence microscopy experiments will be performed to examine co-localization of
PDGFRa/b heterodimers with markers of various endosomal compartments in response to a timecourse of
PDGF-BB ligand stimulation to examine the trafficking dynamics of PDGFRa/b heterodimers. These findings
will be compared to our previous results for the PDGFR homodimers. Second, BiFC-tagged PDGFRa
homodimers, PDGFRb homodimers and PDGFRa/b heterodimers will be purified using the GFP-Trap
nanobody and analyzed by mass spectrometry to identify PDGFR dimer-specific interacting proteins. Novel
proteins with demonstrated roles in receptor trafficking will be both overexpressed and repressed in the
relevant PDGFR-BiFC stable cell line in the presence of PDGF ligand, and trafficking of the various PDGFR
dimers will be assessed as above. Finally, Venus expression will be analyzed in craniofacial structures of E8.5-
E16.5 embryos that are double-homozygous for PdgfraV1 and PdgfrbV2 BiFC knock-in alleles both in whole
mount and in coronal frozen sections by fluorescence microscopy to examine the timing and localization of
PDGFRa/b heterodimer formation during craniofacial development. The studies proposed here will determine
how biological specificity is introduced downstream of individual PDGFR dimers and provide valuable insight
into the mechanisms underlying mammalian craniofacial development."

It is only recently that the field became aware that certain tissue resident macrophages, including alveolar
macrophages and microglial cells, are fetal stem cell derived lineages that behave markedly differently from
blood monocyte derived macrophages. With such knowledge we need revisit the role of tissue resident
macrophages as HIV-1 reservoirs and their contribution to viral persistence. We have shown that regulatory
pathways in infected macrophages, such as pro-survival pathways, can be inhibited by targeting specific
lncRNAs, thus driving selective cell death in infected but not uninfected macrophages. Such observations lay
the groundwork for eradication of HIV-1 reservoirs, however, biologics, such as lncRNAs, are not as tractable as
small molecule inhibitors to progress into therapeutics.
 We have extensive, documented expertise in macrophage biology in both mouse and human lung, and
we have maintained a productive anti-TB drug discovery program based on phenotypic screening for compounds
active in infected macrophages. With this expertise we propose the identification and functional characterization
of small molecule epigenetic inhibitors capable of modifying host macrophage programming to drive selective
induction of cell death in specific myeloid cell lineages, and probing the underlying mechanism(s).
Our Specific Aims are:
1. Phenotypic Profiling HIV-1 infected HMDMs and AMs by transcriptional analysis. We will conduct
 transcriptional profiling on HIV-1 infected HMDMs and AMs to assess the diversity of the cellular
 responses to infection in both active and latent infection states in the two lineages.
2. Screening small molecule inhibitors of epigenetic programming in experimental infection in
 HMDMs and AMs, and in HC69.5 microglial cells. We have a library of 735 small molecule epigenetic
 inhibitors and will screen this compound collection against HIV-1 infected HMDMs, AMs, and against the
 immortalized human microglial cell line HC69.5, with the emphasis on identifying compounds that drive
 cell death across the different macrophage lineages and infection models.
3. Progressing hits through mode-of-action studies to identify actionable compounds. We propose
 analysis of HIV-1/macrophage biology prioritizing compounds that induce cell death in HIV-1 infected
 macrophages. Finally, to evaluate candidate compounds for their ability to drive cell death and suppress
 viral persistence we will assess activity through ex vivo drug treatment and cell survival and viral
 outgrowth from AMs from viremic HIV-1 positive human donors in Malawi."

Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) is a rare genetic disease characterized by chronic wounds
and shortened lifespan due to a high incidence of early-onset squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The highly
aggressive nature of SCC in RDEB patients warrants further mechanistic study. High mobility group box 1
(HMGB1) is a serum biomarker of disease severity in RDEB, but its role in tumorigenesis in patients with RDEB
has not been thoroughly investigated. HMGB1 is a chromatin-associated protein that functions in the nucleus as
a regulator of DNA replication and repair. In response to inflammatory signals, HMGB1 is secreted from the
nucleus and functions as a damage associated molecular pattern that stimulates the innate immune response.
The central hypothesis of this proposal is that depletion of nuclear HMGB1 in keratinocytes drives carcinogenesis
in RDEB by promoting inflammation and accelerating genome instability. This hypothesis will be tested through
two specific aims investigating the effects of sequestering HMGB1 in the nucleus. The first aim explores the
impact of altered HMGB1 localization on inflammatory response and genomic instability in RDEB keratinocytes.
The second aim evaluates the usefulness of small molecule inhibitors of HMGB1 secretion in preventing tumor
formation using an in vivo mouse model of RDEB. Successful completion of these aims will provide new
information on the biological function of HMGB1 in patients with RDEB SCC. The results of this study have the
potential to reveal new drug targets for a fragile patient population in desperate need of safe and effective
treatment options.
This proposal will be completed at the University of Minnesota under the co-mentorship of Dr. Jakub Tolar, a
physician-scientist and pediatric oncologist specializing in RDEB, and Dr. Anja-Katrin Bielinsky, an expert in
genome maintenance and DNA repair defects in the initiation of cancer. The complementary expertise of the co-
sponsors uniquely positions the candidate to complete the aims described in this proposal and achieve her goal
of becoming an academic pediatric hematologist-oncologist leading a research lab focused on examining
mechanisms underlying rare genetic diseases and cancer. The career development and fellowship training plans
outlined in this application build the foundation for a long and productive career investigating better treatments
for pediatric patients with complex and difficult-to-treat genetic conditions."

The dynamic adaptability of the mammalian brain to environmental changes is remarkable, as it is the complexity
of the networks of neurons underlying the operations that allow for such adaptations. Although we have some
understanding of the anatomical and functional basis of this, we are still lacking a detailed picture of how the
modulation of neuronal activity works. What is the timing and locations of these neuromodulator release and
relationship with excitatory/inhibitory circuits? How does the neuromodulators circuitry accomplish the regulation
of firing and synaptic properties of targeted neurons? Filling these gaps in knowledge would advance our
understanding of all aspects of neuromodulator biology and allow discovery of new therapeutic strategies. To
help close this gap, we have used creative approaches to the development of genetically encoded to directly
report behaviorally triggered and modulated neuromodulator release including serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA)
and norepinephrine (NE). We have disseminated these indicators to the neuroscience community and spurred
major discoveries of novel mechanisms regulating neuromodulator release underlying motivation and addiction.
Build on this initial success, we propose to further expand the effectiveness of this toolbox of NM sensors to
enable imaging sparse release at depth and subcellular resolution. Our specific goals are to (1) improve the
sensitivity of our current sensors to enable robust imaging of sparse neuromodulator release, push their spatial
resolution to the subcellular level and increase linearity of response at lower concentrations; (2) expand their
spectral range to red/far-red to enhance imaging depth, SNR and in vivo multiplex measurement and
manipulation of multiple circuit components using two or three distinct colors, and (3) characterize the possible
interference of current sensors with endogenous signaling and systematically validate emerging sensors with a
wide-ranging microscopy approaches in vivo. Our strategy relies on a dynamic collaboration between the sensor
design team and end users to obtain continuous feedback to implement efficient improvements to the sensors.
It is our goal to rapidly disseminate a wide range of well-characterized, highly sensitive indicators for the
neuroscience community to be employed to study behaving mice, fish, flies and worms, to enrich our knowledge
on the functional roles of neuromodulators in the brain circuitry."

Auditory processing abnormalities are common and prominent features of neurodevelopmental disorders such
as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A central challenge of autism research is to identify common mechanisms
that underlie sensory processing abnormalities including auditory dysfunction. One prevalent hypothesis is that
the behavioral phenotypes in ASD arise from altered functional connectivity in the brain. Neuroimaging studies
and the transcriptional profile in human ASD indicate that altered myelination and white matter integrity could be
a common pathophysiology that impairs functional connectivity. Auditory processing requires precise and timely
control of axonal conduction and synaptic activity, making the auditory system vulnerable to the developmental
disruptions of ASD. Our long-term goal is to investigate the mechanisms whereby altered myelination and brain
connectivity impair auditory processing in neurodevelopmental disorders. Our previous studies have shown that
alterations in myelination disrupt axonal conduction, alter synaptic function, and impede circuit-level functions in
the auditory brainstem. Our recent studies pioneered a new concept in how excitability in oligodendrocytes (OL),
the myelinating glial cell, contributes to communication between neurons and OLs. We characterized a
subpopulation of excitable OLs that express the voltage-gated Na+ channel 1.2 (Nav1.2), display Nav1.2-
mediated spiking, and respond to neuronal activity. Notably, Scn2a, which encodes the alpha subunit of Nav1.2
channel, has a robust association with ASD. These studies indicate that oligodendroglial Scn2a is important for
electrical excitability in OLs, for communication between OL and neurons, and for establishing functional
connectivity in the auditory brainstem. The primary objective of the proposed study is to link the loss of
oligodendroglial Scn2a to alterations in myelination and neural connectivity in the auditory system to better
understand how auditory processing is altered in Scn2a-mediated disorders and ASD. We have generated a
novel Scn2a conditional knockout mouse (cKO) to specifically delete Scn2a in OLs. These mice exhibit deficits
in myelination, altered neurotransmission, and remarkable changes in auditory function. We hypothesize that
Scn2a expression in developing OLs is required for coordinating neuron-OL interactions that are essential for
myelination and proper development of neural circuits in the auditory nervous system. Using multiple-approaches
including in vivo and in vitro electrophysiology, we will determine the role of Scn2a in OL development and
myelination (Aim 1), examine how the loss of Scn2a-expressing OL alters synaptic transmission and plasticity
at a local synapse in the auditory brainstem (Aim 2), and link the loss of oligodendroglial Scn2a to alterations
neural connectivity and auditory processing abnormalities (Aim 3). In summary, this study will reveal how loss
of Nav1.2-mediated OL excitability alters myelination, functional connectivity, and auditory processing in the
auditory brainstem. Understand how altered myelination results in neural circuitry dysfunction that functionally
related to auditory processing abnormalities in a novel model will provide better therapeutic strategies for ASD."

The clinical and biological consequences of telomere dysfunction manifest in telomere biology disorders like
dyskeratosis congenita (DC). DC is an inherited multisystem disorder characterized by degenerative phenotypes
in tissues with high cell turnover, which often includes bone marrow failure and gastrointestinal (GI) disease. GI
pathologies in DC patients include enterocolitis, mucosal ulceration, and malabsorption—findings that indicate a
link between telomere dysfunction, intestinal regeneration, and gut barrier integrity. Thus, we seek to elucidate
how telomere dysfunction impacts the homeostatic turnover of the intestinal epithelium (IE) to inform future
therapeutic approaches. In the IE, intestinal stem cells (ISCs) require canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway activity
to maintain the tissue’s rapid cell turnover. Our lab discovered that Wnt activity and telomere fidelity lie in a
positive feedback loop—telomerase and telomere capping genes are Wnt pathway targets, and telomere fidelity
is required to sustain Wnt target gene expression. Recently, a population of mesenchymal Foxl1+ telocytes in
the lamina propria directly underlying the IE has been identified as the critical niche source of Wnt ligands
required for ISC proliferative self-renewal. However, in the context of telomere dysfunction, ISCs exhibit a loss
of self-renewal and a broad downregulation of Wnt target gene expression, corresponding to the downregulation
of Wnt ligands now known to secreted from subepithelial telocytes. The goal of this proposal is therefore to
understand the consequences of telomere dysfunction on ISC niche function. Our overarching hypothesis is that
telomere failure suppresses telocyte-derived niche support for ISCs, contributing to the intestinal phenotypes
associated with telomeropathies. To address this hypothesis, we will utilize a novel Foxl1CreERT2-2A-tdTomato reporter
mouse line that will allow for direct in situ visualization of Foxl1+ telocytes, crossed with an mTerc-/- mouse line
that features genetic deletion of the telomerase RNA component (mTerc), leading to loss of telomerase activity
and progressive telomere dysfunction. We seek to determine the niche factor gene expression and telomere
defects in Foxl1+ telocytes in mTerc-/-::Foxl1CreERT2-2A-tdTomato mice by a combination of in situ assays and single-
cell RNAseq on isolated telocytes. We will also determine the functional consequences of telocyte-specific
defects on ISC self-renewal by utilizing primary organotypic co-culture assays in which primary telocytes and
crypt epithelia-derived organoids from mutant mTerc-/-::Foxl1CreERT2-2A-tdTomato and control reporter mice are
isolated and co-cultured. Lastly, we will determine whether wildtype donor bone marrow-derived telocytes have
the ability to engraft within the lamina propria of mTerc-/- mice and rescue ISC function by restoring niche-derived
Wnt activators to the ISC compartment. The findings from this proposal will elucidate how telomere dysfunction
alters the ISC niche, and thus inform future therapeutic approaches aimed toward alleviating telomere
dysfunction-driven disorders like dyskeratosis congenita."

Development of the nervous system requires the generation of diverse neuronal types that subsequently
drastically alter their shape and physiology to form vast interconnected networks. Each process requires
precise gene regulation. Technological innovations have drastically increased the scale at which we can
distinguish neuronal identities or stages based on transcriptomics or epigenetics. However, principles guiding
post-transcriptional control of gene expression, which is essential for neural development and homeostasis, by
regulatory factors including RNA-binding proteins (RBP) and miRNAs has not been defined at a similar
systematic level. As numerous neurodegenerative disorders have been linked to impaired RBP-RNA
interactions, and there is a huge need for improved cell type engineering strategies for therapeutics, insight
into this process is critically important. I propose to use the Drosophila visual system as a model to study post-
transcriptional regulation during specification and wiring of an entire neural sensory system. Specifically, this
proposal focuses on the regulation of mRNA translational repression, which is a conserved feature of both
neuronal fate diversification and differentiation in vertebrate and invertebrates. A single-cell transcriptomic atlas
of the developing visual system, or optic lobe, was recently described which defines the transcriptome of each
neuronal type in the optic lobe throughout development. Consistent with results from other model systems,
many genes associated with terminal neuronal function were detected at transcripts in the immature neurons
well before they are functionally required, and the corresponding protein was absent for two selected genes
studied. I aim to define the scope of translational regulation in this system by first performing whole-tissue and
select cell-specific ribosome profiling of the optic lobe over development, and determine the upstream control
of this process using a combination of bioinformatics and genetics (Aim 1). Next I will tease apart the molecular
and cellular mechanism by which two genes associated with different neuron signaling pathways are repressed
at the translational level to assess how their expression is coordinated (Aim 2). Finally, I will adapt a single-cell
translation profiling technique, scRibo-STAMP, in the Drosophila visual system to profile translation of all optic
lobe neurons during specification and wiring. Combined with machine-learning based analysis, I will predict
RBP/miRNA-RNA target interactions to gain fundamental insight into how RNA regulatory networks are shaped
(Aim 3). Together this study will provide significant insights into the role of translational regulation during
formation of the nervous system relevant to both human development and health."
10820139,"Project Summary/Abstract The endosomal-lysosomal system is responsible for cellular protein degradation,
and thus for protein homeostasis (proteostasis) in all cells. Neurons are spatially complex, large cell types, and
must survive for the lifetime of an organism. This makes maintenance of the neuronal proteome unusually
challenging. Disruption of lysosomal protein degradation can lead to accumulation of toxic aggregates, neuronal
dysfunction, and death. Normal protein degradation can be disrupted via direct damage to lysosomes, which
leads to leakage of luminal lysosomal contents into the cytosol in a process known as lysosomal membrane
permeabilization (LMP), which can facilitate cell death. LMP is often causally linked to neurological pathologies
that disproportionately affect aging populations. Even though lysosomes are critical to neuronal proteostasis, the
response of neurons to LMP on a mechanistic level is poorly understood. Further, despite the intimate
relationship between endosomal and lysosomal function, the role of endosomes in LMP responses is unknown.
 The small GTPase Rab7 is a master regulator of late endosomes and lysosomes. It is also critical for
autophagy. Mutations in Rab7 lead to Charcot Marie-Tooth 2B (CMT2B) disease, a progressive peripheral
neuropathy. My preliminary data suggest that Rab7 is an acute responder to LMP. Following LMP, Rab7
accumulates on various enlarged vesicular compartments, including late endosomes (LEs) and lysosomes (Lys),
in a hyperactive, GTP-bound state. Within neurons, this response is exclusively localized to the soma. In this
proposal, I aim to discover (1) the requirement of Rab7 activation for downstream LMP responses, such as
galectin-3 accumulation on Lys and enlargement of LEs, (2) the impact of CMT2B mutant alleles on known LMP
responses and Rab7 activation post LMP induction, and (3) the impact of age on Rab7 mediated neuronal
degradation and LMP responses. I posit that Rab7 activation is essential in coordinating early responses for
endosomal damage control in LMP.
 I will test the hypothesis that Rab7 activation following LMP is an essential response that mediates a
protective pathway in neurons, which is disrupted in CMT2B mutant alleles. In Aim 1, I will explore the necessity
of Rab7 activation in (1) galectin-3 mediated lysophagy and (2) LE vacuolization in response to LMP. In Aim 2,
I will test whether Lys/LE responses and Rab7 activation in response to LMP are impacted in CMT2B. In Aim 3,
I will determine whether aging disrupts Rab7 mediated (1) cargo degradation and (2) LMP responses in wild-
type and mutant CMT2B neurons. Together, these experiments will determine homeostatic mechanisms in
neurons that address lysosomal insults and whether this is impacted in disease. My long-term goal is to discover
and characterize compensatory endosomal response mechanisms to lysosomal disruptions in LMP that will be
broadly applicable to neurological disorders for the ultimate design of better therapeutics."

 2 The increasingly limited availability of affordable housing paired with a shortage in provision of federal rental
 3 assistance among eligible families means millions of low-income, U.S. children live in unstable and/or substand-
 4 ard-quality housing – conditions which have been linked to a range of adverse child health and development
 5 outcomes. The lack of affordable housing in low-poverty neighborhoods further contributes to families living in
 6 crowded housing conditions and/or residing in neighborhoods that expose children to stressful, unsafe environ-
 7 ments. Although infants and toddlers experience the highest rates of childhood poverty and spend a substantial
 8 portion of their time at home, there exists little evidence assessing the impact of adverse housing and neighbor-
 9 hood conditions specifically on the health and development of this age group. Moreover, as less than 25% of
10 eligible, low-income families with young children receiving housing assistance, there is need to understand
11 whether other anti-poverty programs can help improve housing conditions for these children and their families.
12 The proposed research seeks to address these knowledge gaps and provide scientific evidence to inform
13 the design of anti-poverty programs that aim to improve early housing and neighborhood environments for low-
14 income children. By using data from Baby’s First Years (BFY) – a randomized control trial evaluating the impact
15 of a monthly, unconditional cash transfer (UCT) to low-income, U.S. mothers and their young children (NICHD
16 R01HD087384) – this research will provide a rich understanding of the housing and neighborhood ecosystems

10923816,"Drug-resistant, focal epilepsy impacts millions of children, and treatment often requires invasive evaluation. This
process entails identification of intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) biomarkers such as spike-and-wave
discharges (SWDs), to guide surgical removal of the presumed epileptogenic zone responsible for generating
habitual seizures. In pediatric patients, extra-operative iEEG evidence indicated that a SWD proxy measuring
coupling between delta wave phase and high-frequency oscillation (HFO) amplitude – Modulation Index (MI) –
accurately tracks epileptogenicity. Since MI does not detail the causality of neural propagations, it’s powerful to
also consider iEEG Transfer Entropy (TE), which measures effective connectivity, and dynamic tractography to
provide plausible propagation pathways. Granted, capturing adequate interictal and ictal epileptic events often
requires days of extra-operative iEEG recording, and this procedure is grueling, expensive, and replete with
major risk factors. Thus, development of intra-operative techniques for induction and reliable measurement of
epileptic iEEG biomarkers is imperative to avoid the above pitfalls and help expand utility of one-stage
procedures. Pertinently, sevoflurane anesthesia reversibly activates spike activity, but there is much debate
over its specificity. Preliminary iEEG results in children suggest that sevoflurane may intra-operatively augment
both MI and HFO effective connectivity (TE) in seizure foci. However, large cohort studies are needed to validate
this finding, as it is unknown how sevoflurane impacts intra-operative MI and HFO-TE in healthy versus
epileptogenic brain areas and if these signals spread via major white matter tracts. Thus, the main aims of the
current proposal are to: 1) build normative atlases of intra-operative MI and HFO-TE, at varying
concentrations of sevoflurane, and 2) determine if sevoflurane-induced modulation of these features can
localize seizure foci and predict seizure outcomes. To accomplish these aims, the trainee will map patient
electrodes to 3-dimensional magnetic resonance brain images, quantify the intra-operative iEEG metrics at
stepwise increases of sevoflurane, and combine iEEG effective connectivity with white matter tractography (i.e.
dynamic tractography). Characterizing the endogenous distribution of MI and HFO effective connectivity, with
and without sevoflurane, will provide critical baseline reference for iEEG interpretation. In addition, understanding
how sevoflurane impacts these metrics in epileptic networks is expected to improve interictal localization efforts
during surgery, reduce invasive diagnostic burden by mitigating the need for extra-operative recording, optimize
treatment cost effectiveness, and ultimately improve seizure outcomes. Through this project, the trainee will: (1)
gain insight into and help refine clinical epilepsy treatment, (2) enhance scientific understanding of how neural
oscillatory coupling and effective connectivity respond under sevoflurane, and (3) will undergo a training regimen
to foster development of critical thinking and hypothesis-driven, ethical research design. The cumulative effect
of the research and didactics will provide a critical foundation for the trainee’s career as a physician-scientist."

We study a microtubule motor called cytoplasmic dynein-1 (or “dynein” for simplicity). In
eukaryotic cells, microtubules serve as tracks for motor proteins such as dynein and kinesins to
move on. These motor proteins deliver cargoes, including organelles, vesicles, proteins, and
mRNAs, to different cellular locations for function. A microtubule has two different ends: the plus
end facing cell periphery and the minus end close to the cell center. Dynein is a minus-end-
directed motor, and it transports cargoes from the cell periphery toward the cell center. Besides
the physiological cargoes including early endosomes and other organelles/vesicles, dynein also
transports virus particles inward after viral infection. Our lab uses a filamentous fungus called
Aspergillus nidulans as a genetic system to study how dynein activities in live cells are
controlled by other proteins. We and other scientists have found that dynein gets transported by
a kinesin to the microtubule plus end where it interacts with early endosome via adapter
proteins such as the HookA complex and the dynactin complex. In live cells, these adapter
proteins are required for activating dynein to move toward the microtubule minus end. However,
this process also requires other proteins such as LIS1 (Lissencephaly-1) and VezA (a vezatin-
like protein). LIS1 promotes an “open” conformation of dynein to facilitate its activation, but the
mechanism of VezA is unclear. Our preliminary data also suggest that negative regulators are
needed to prevent dynein from moving away from the plus end prematurely without carrying its
cargo, but the negative regulators remain to be identified. Moreover, it is unclear what factors
regulate cargo release at the microtubule minus end. In the next five years, we will combine
classical genetics, live cell imaging with whole genome sequencing to identify both positive and
negative regulators of dynein activities. We will also use live cell imaging, proteomics and
structural analysis to solve the mechanisms of VezA and newly identified regulators. The
Aspergillus genetic system is best suited for these studies. While in vitro experiments are
excellent for studying known proteins, our genetic system has the power for discovering
unknown regulators. Discovering these regulators will pave the ways leading to new areas of
research in the field, which will stimulate further work involving collaborations to gain
mechanistic insights into the intricate regulation of the dynein motor.

for graduate students and occupational health and safety (OHS) practitioners addressing four themes: (1) emerging
technologies in exposure assessment; (2) home health care; (3) sustainability and OHS practices; and (4) ergonomics and
aerosol exposure. The instruction and research experiences will engage multidisciplinary teams from the University of
Michigan, University of Cincinnati, and Michigan State University with considerable experience expertise and
commitment to OHS and this program. Training and research in four themes will address joint occupational and
environmental stressors that can affect OHS, as well as the changing nature of the workplace. Activities in the MOORE
Program will include creating a common and cross-cutting infrastructure for educational programs at partnering
institutions; developing new web-based modules that address these themes; embedding these modules in existing
courses and developing new courses and certificate programs for our occupational and environmental health science
programs; offering these modules as continuing education (CE) courses to working professionals; and providing intensive
research experiences for graduate and post-graduate students and professionals that are linked to applications in the
four areas. These offerings will utilize a common rubric that incorporates evidence-based backward curriculum design,
utilize the Wikipedia environment that both engages students and adds content to this well-used public resource, and
employ robust external and ongoing evaluations to ensure the highest quality offerings and responsiveness to trainee
and professional needs. Drawing on the strong and complementary OHS programs and outstanding resources at the
three universities, this partnership will greatly expand offerings available to students at our institutions and the broader

several three-dimensional (3D) chromosome structure modeling methods. Many observations become more
apparent in 3D because some relationships—for example, evolutionary constraints or cell-to-cell variability of
mammalian chromosome structures—cannot be surmised by genomic sequences alone. Although members of
the bioinformatics community, including the PI, have developed many algorithms for reconstructing 3D genome
structures based on population Hi-C data, we lack computationally effective methods to precisely model at a
high-resolution (<=5 kilobase (kb)). One difficulty is the exponentially increasing number of fragments at this
resolution. My work in the last five years provides the premise for the current proposal and uniquely positions
my interdisciplinary research program to carry out the proposed studies. The PI proposes to conduct leading
research to overcome this challenge and address important questions that remain about how (and why) 3D
genome structures across cells are organized and about the relationship between 3D structure and genetic and
epigenetic mechanisms for gene expression. During the next five years, the PI’s objective is to develop
computational and machine learning-based models to further highlight the hierarchical organization of, and the
refined structures within, the genome. The PI proposes to explore the development of innovative models for 3D
chromosome and genome reconstruction using a novel noninstance-based generalizable model based on a
graph convolutional neural network to generalize across resolutions, chromosomes, restriction enzymes, and
cell populations. Given the PI’s background, track record, and productivity in the genomic research field, the
computational objectives defined here are not only feasible but also computationally and biologically rewarding
to the bioinformatics community at large. Computationally, our methodology will resemble a robust one-size-fits-
all model that can be sufficiently trained at a lower computational cost on less complex data and be used across
multiple higher resolutions for 3D structural modeling. Biologically, our proposed reconstruction algorithms will
aid diseases diagnosis, prevention or treatment by shedding light on the relationship between long-range
interaction and gene expression in human cells and how disruptions in physical interactions between genes and
the enhancers or silencers could aberrantly alter gene expression. Thus, this research demonstrates the
potential impact of knowing the architecture of the genome to the understanding of biological processes and
human disease. Once the proposed objectives are completed, the PI will ultimately have been well established
as an independent investigator, and will have proposed leading robust, high-performing, and efficient
computational algorithms that will provide new vertical advancement in the chromatin genomics research field."

The Emory U54 SeroNET U54 program is a multidisciplinary program that brings together
experienced team of investigators to tackle fundamental issues relating to immunity to
SARS CoV-2, particular in patients with cancer and autoimmunity. The team has a long
track record of prior work in basic and translational studies in the setting of viral infections,
vaccines and cancer. The program consists of 3 interacting projects and two essential
cores in addition to the administrative core. Studies in project 1 (led by Sanz) will study
the biology of SARS CoV-2 specific effector B cell responses in patients with
autoimmunity, with a particular focus on extrafollicular B cell pathway. Studies in project
2 (led by Sekaly and Wrammert) will study the role of inflammatory milieu in regulating
antiviral immunity and in the development of long term memory responses. Studies in
project 3 (led by Dhodapkar and Ahmed) will focus on studying the impact of specific
cancer therapies, in particular B/plasma cell depleting therapies in patients with B/plasma
cell malignancies, and immune checkpoint blockade in patients with lung cancer. These
studies will also set the stage for studying immune responses to future SARS CoV-2
vaccines in patients with autoimmunity as well as cancer patients. The programs are
supported by active cores (led by Roback and Neish) which have experience with
monitoring immunity to SARS CoV-2. Together, this program will not only provide basic
insights into immune-pathogenesis of COVID, but also provide the consortium with
access to unique patient populations at higher risk of COVID-related mortality."

This new application seeks NIEHS RISE (R25) sponsorship for our innovative advanced program entitled
“Frontiers in Environmental Science and Human Health (FrESH)” to train and mentor promising graduates,
medical students, post-doctoral fellows and junior faculty from predominantly underrepresented communities in
sophisticated technologies in Environmental Health Science Research research. This proposal is responsive to
RFA-ES-20-015 as its main goal is to create educational opportunities for graduate students, medical students,
postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty in areas of environmental health science research pertinent to the NIEHS,
while fostering the career development of these students and fellows. A major strength of FrESH is that it draws
from underrepresented minority (URM) applicant pools; The Atlanta University Center (AUC) which includes
Morehouse College, Spelman College and Clark Atlanta University, which is the largest consortium of black
institutions of higher education in the USA as well as Hispanic and Native American Serving Institutions.
Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM) is linked directly to these institutions through a formal system of pipeline
programs. In addition, we plan to draw URM’s from other institutions regardless of their URM population size.
Our target population is diverse and among the most promising nationally competitive trainees. FrESH offers
dynamic training through a series of daily lecturers on emerging concepts, extended discussion, laboratory
research, workshops and informal seminars for a week-long summer course. The primary aim is the development
of an intense laboratory-based training for 16 participants per year to educate them in Environmental Health
Science, and to help launch and sustain their careers. We propose a five-year program to enroll a total of eighty
(80) trainees (16 trainees per year) for training at MSM. In summary, FrESH will offer dynamic and sophisticated
training courses that consist of daily lectures from leading experts, active learning sessions, and extended
discussions on important and emerging topics followed by hands-on laboratory sessions. Examples of topics
within FrESH include: disparate impacts of air pollutants, water pollutants, and common persistent pollutants
such as flame retardants and pesticides; gene x environment interactions in driving health outcomes; exposome
and lifetime exposure impacts on human health; impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on human exposures to
environmental toxicants; and dissemination and implementation strategies to engage health care providers to
consider environmental contaminants in diagnoses and treatments, especially with regard to URM patients."

Our training program in pulmonary disease and critical care medicine provides comprehensive research
training for individuals with a serious commitment to a career in lung biology and biomedical research,
particularly as it interfaces with clinical pulmonary and critical care medicine. Lung diseases comprise a major
source of excess morbidity and mortality worldwide, so our primary premise is that progress toward improved
understanding of the pathobiology of these diseases is required to make progress toward treatment and
prevention. The program has a long history (>30 years) of training numerous physician-scientists and scientists
who have subscribed to this mission and have become leaders in academic pulmonary and critical care
medicine. No changes are anticipated in the program leadership structure. We plan to maintain the previous
scientific and training success, while adapting the next generation of researchers to the constantly changing
state-of-the-art of basic and translational science. Recent changes have included expanded resources
(recruitment of new faculty members, and increased laboratory space) and development of the Brigham
Research Institute’s Lung Research Center. This has allowed us to broaden the scope of research questions
related to lung biology and attack problems at the most basic and translational levels incorporating new core
resources. We have continued to enhance our didactic program and further solidify program organization for
oversight and mentoring of trainees. We identify trainees with a demonstrated interest in and commitment to a
research career, help them locate a training environment to pursue a problem of interest and in which creative
and rigorous thinking combined with state-of-the-art technology is being used to pursue the problem, and
provide them with the tools and mindset to attack related problems in the future. Finally, we provide a
prolonged period of support so that trainees are prepared to ultimately become productive independent
investigators, and future leaders in academic pulmonary and critical care medicine. Of the 40 trainees who
have completed the program over the last decade, 38 (95%) remain in academic medicine or research.
Moreover, of the 40 trainees who have completed the program, our trainees have been awarded 46 grant
awards (Table 8C) consisting of 24 NIH mentorship awards (18 K awards and 6 F32 NRSA), 1 DOD career
development award, 3 independent R-awards, 1 Site PI for a UG3, 3 Parker B. Francis awards, and 13
foundation awards (Harvard Catalyst KL2, Pulmonary Fibrosis Foundation, American Heart Association,
American Lung Association, LAM Foundation, PCORI, American Thoracic Society, AstraZeneca, Peabody
Foundation, and Stork Fund).. In addition, our T32 appointed trainees have published 324 papers with their
training grant mentors as co-authors. The Program Director and Associate Program Directors of this training
program will continue to work with the utmost enthusiasm and energy to ensure that the trainees will continue
to excel and contribute significantly to the academic pulmonary community."

Despite recent emphasis on couples-based HIV prevention interventions, efficacious interventions for Latinx
male couples have yet to be tested. The proposed study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of an HIV
prevention couples-based intervention - Connecting Latinxs en Pareja (CLP). CLP is based on our team’s
extensive formative work with couples, including remote delivery of study protocols and the use of biomarkers
of adherence to HIV treatment and pre-exposure prophylaxis. CLP was specifically tailored to the needs of
Latinx male couples. CLP, a four-session intervention grounded in social cognitive theory and a relationship-
oriented ecological framework, has demonstrated high feasibility and acceptability in a recent pilot RCT and
promising evidence of changes in key intervention mechanisms and outcomes. CLP is novel in that it (1)
integrates both biomedical prevention techniques (i.e., pre-exposure prophylaxis [PrEP] and treatment as
prevention [TasP]) and psycho-educational skill building; (2) offers culturally competent and linguistically
appropriate information and education about options for PrEP and ART; (3) is driven by an HIV status-neutral
prevention and treatment approach designed to address HIV prevention and care needs among
seroconcordant (positive and negative) and serodiscordant couples; (4) employs an innovative algorithm for
measuring HIV protection that goes beyond condom use as the sole indicator of HIV protection; and (5) is
culturally tailored to Latinx couples to address social, environmental, and contextual factors that intensify HIV
risk in this population including HIV-related stigma and discrimination. We will examine whether participants
assigned to CLP report an increase in the proportion of HIV protected anal sex acts to those assigned to a
Wellness Promotion (WP) time and attention matched control condition. The primary outcome, HIV protection,
is operationalized with a validated composite algorithm as protected acts of anal intercourse (i.e., anal sex acts
in which condoms, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), treatment as prevention (TasP), or a combination thereof,
are used to reduce risk of HIV transmission) within the couple and with outside partners. We will recruit 150
Latinx male couples (N=300 individuals) from 50 Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) jurisdictions and an
additional 17 jurisdictions with high HIV burden among Latinos. Follow-up will occur every 3 months over 9
months, and biological (self-testing for HIV and hair biomarkers for PrEP and ART adherence) and behavioral
and psychosocial data will be collected. We will derive practical recommendations and considerations for key
stakeholders to expand and improve implementation of CLP or other next steps as indicated by study results.
To our knowledge, this study will be the first to examine the efficacy of a couple-based intervention to increase
HIV protection for Latinx male couples capable of being scaled up to provide continuous support and protection
for this heavily impacted group."

The ability to determine the three-dimensional location of ﬂuorescently labeled biomolecules in cells with 10 to 70
nm resolution has led to an explosion of discoveries in biology. Super-resolution optical microscopy has led to recent
dramatic breakthroughs in our understanding of the organization of molecules in a wide variety of protein assemblies
and has led to discoveries of new supramolecular architectures present in organelles. The spatial resolution typically
achieved by super-resolution optical microscopy remains, frustratingly, considerably larger than most biomolecules.
 The goal of this technology development proposal is to create a technology for localizing individual biomolecules
with angstrom precision. We propose a technology for localizing molecules using spin labels. The proposed work
will employ a magnetic resonance force microscope, in which an attonewton-sensitivity cantilever with a 100
nanometer diameter magnetic tip is operated near a sample surface in high vacuum at cryogenic temperatures.
The magnet-tipped cantilever serves two roles. It acts as a force-gradient detector, enabling the observation of
magnetic resonance from individual electron spins as a shift of the cantilever's mechanical resonance frequency. It
furthermore provides a source of magnetic ﬁeld gradient, 5 gauss/angstrom or larger, that makes possible the three
dimensional magnetic resonance imaging of individual electron spin labels with angstrom spatial resolution. Proof-
of-concept data has been acquired demonstrating the ability to detect magnetic resonance from 100's of nitroxide
spin labels and to spatially resolve electron spin density at a resolution 100 times smaller than the diameter of the
magnetic tip.
 We present a stepwise technology development plan — backed by theory, simulations, and preliminary data
— for achieving the detection of individual nitroxide spin labels and imaging their locations in three dimensions
with angstrom precision. Proposed innovations include achieving near-unity spin polarization by operating at high
magnetic ﬁeld and low temperature using novel cryogenic chip-scale microwave sources, employing better inter-
ferometric cantilever position detectors and spin modulation schemes to evade sample-related noise, harnessing
synchronized cantilever and spin excitation pulse sequences to achieve high ﬁdelity spin modulation, developing
robust Bayesian image collection and reconstruction protocols, and fabricating improved cantilevers and magnetic
tips for increased per-spin sensitivity. The technology will be validated using well characterized nucleic-acid rulers,
biomolecules, protein complexes, and antibodies. Proof-of-concept experiments will be carried out to demonstrate
the applicability of the technology to ﬂash frozen biological samples and the ability to carry out correlative ﬂuo-
rescent localization experiments. Taken together the proposed work represents a new technology for localizing an
individual (spin-labeled and ﬂuorescently labeled) biomolecule in a ﬂash-frozen cell with angstrom precision."
10866519,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
This project responds to FOA PA-21-235. A variety of well-characterized and valid methods for power and sam-
ple size (PSS) estimation in generalized linear models (GLM) have been developed. These are primarily in the
area of linear models for continuous data and logistic regression for binary data. By and large, methods that are
more general require a prior speciﬁcation of several study-speciﬁc details in order to be implemented in a par-
ticular application, and this can pose challenges for applied statisticians and non-statistical collaborators. These
challenges have impeded the study design of translational mental health research, randomized clinical trials in
psychiatric populations, and other investigations that involve GLM in ways that linear models do not. To overcome
these challenges, the overarching goal of this project is to develop methods for estimating power, needed sample
size, or minimally-detectable effect size in study designs involving GLMs. To be broadly useful, such methods
should be accurate, interpretable, and, importantly, easily-speciﬁed.
 This project offers, in the framework of GLMs, a general formulation with the aim to recapture, to close approx-
imation, features of the common approach to PSS for linear models, namely the use of partial multiple R-squared
as a general measure of effect size. This is accomplished by introducing two GLM analogues of R-squared. Local
and more distal alternative hypotheses are considered, the latter requiring more attention to yield accurate re-
sults as the alternative hypothesis moves further from the null. Both Wald and score tests (which coincide under
linear models) are also considered. This project has three speciﬁc aims: Using novel GLM analogues of multiple
partial R-squared for linear models, develop approaches to estimate power, needed sample size, or minimally
detectable effect size for Wald (Aim 1) and score (Aim 2) tests to be conducted in the framework of GLMs. Aim 3
is to develop, test, document and disseminate software implementing the new methods. The developed methods
are guided by and applied to two collaborative projects in translational mental health.
 The expectation is a new and general suite of applicable and usable approaches to power and sample size es-
timation for the “bread-and-butter” class of generalized linear models forming the foundation of so many analysis
methods in modern biomedical and public health investigation."

Asthma affects over 300 million individuals worldwide. Uncontrolled asthma is associated with a
doubling of direct costs, missed workdays, and school absenteeism; up to 80% of asthma patients
may be uncontrolled with regard to asthma symptoms. Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) are
stable intercellular communicators that function to regulate gene expression and can serve as
biomarkers for symptoms and disease. The overall objective of this study is to ascertain the role
of circulating miRNA and miRNA genetics in control of asthma symptoms. In this competitive
renewal proposal, “Genomics and Pharmacogenomics of Symptoms in Asthma”, we hypothesize
that circulating miRNAs are functionally associated with asthma treatment guidelines-
based symptoms control, symptomatic exacerbations, and symptoms response to
therapy. Asthma symptoms will be defined as well-controlled, poorly controlled, and uncontrolled
via Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines and by frequency of severe exacerbations. The
relevant miRNAs will be identified via three specific aims. The first aim seeks to identify
differentially expressed miRNAs influencing asthma symptoms control through miRNA
sequencing of serum samples from multiple asthma cohorts totaling over 4000 subjects. Cross
sectional studies will identify miRNAs indicative of mechanistic differences between the controlled
and uncontrolled asthmatic, while pharmacogenomic and longitudinal studies will identify miRNAs
that provide biologic insights and may form the basis of a predictive biomarker test for
identification and treatment of the difficult to control asthmatic. The second aim evaluates the
role of miRNA genetics in asthma symptoms control through identification of polymorphisms that
affect miRNA expression (via allele specific expression) and those affecting miRNA biogenesis.
The salient variants will be identified via whole genome sequencing in over 3500 asthmatic
subjects and through whole genome imputed genome-wide association data in over 30,000
asthmatic subjects. The genetic variants will be associated with symptoms control and assessed
for ability to predict ongoing symptoms and drug treatment response. The final aim will
functionally link the miRNA and genetic variants, including miR-130a-3p and let-7b-5p, from Aims
1 and 2 with physiologic and inflammatory changes in human airway epithelial cells, using miRNA
mimics, miRNA inhibitors, and CRISPR-based gene editing. The success of this proposal will
yield novel understanding into the pathogenesis of asthma symptoms control and asthma
exacerbations and may provide direct future bedside clinical translation in the form of biomarkers
to enhance guidelines based therapeutic recommendations and/or miRNA based therapeutics."

Clostridium difficile is the leading nosocomial infection in the U.S. Host factors are a key predictor of disease
outcomes after C. difficile infection (CDI). We have discovered a key role for leptin receptor (LEPR) pathway and
the pro-inflammatory cytokine Macrophage Inhibitory Factor (MIF) in CDI pathogenesis. Our data reveal that a
common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the gene for LEPR (Q223R; present in up to 50% of humans)
is associated with exaggerated MIF production after CDI in humans. CDI in mice homozygous for the mutant
SNP (RR) resulted in higher MIF production, more colonic neutrophilia and tissue damage, without effects on
pathogen. We reported that neutralizing MIF using antibody resulted in reduced tissue injury and improved
survival in mice, without effects on C. difficile pathogen. Finally, blocking a key receptor for MIF, CXC chemokine
receptor 2 (CXCR2) also reduced CDI-induced neutrophil accrual in tissue. This proposal is based on these
published results and new preliminary data which indicate that LEPR Q to R change augments Bcl-2 like protein
11 (Bim) expression which controls MIF release by modulating pathways of autophagy/mitophagy/apoptosis.
The overall hypothesis of our studies is that: LEPR Q to R substitution exaggerates CDI-induced, Bim-dependent
MIF release that augments CXCR2-dependent tissue neutrophil accrual and worsens disease severity. To test
this hypothesis, we propose three specific aims. Aim 1 will define the key pathogen-associated drivers of MIF
and the main cellular sources of MIF production in CDI. We will use WT and toxin-deficient C. difficile strains to
determine the role of toxins and non-toxin factors in driving MIF expression. Cellular sources of MIF will be
defined after CDI in WT mice by intracellular staining and immunohistochemistry and their role in CDI will be
tested by using selective MIF deletion in intestinal epithelial cells and in hematopoietic cells. Aim 2 will examine
the mechanism of CDI-induced MIF release. We will determine the role of LEPR Q to R substitution in regulating
Bim expression and subsequent autophagy, mitophagy and apoptosis pathways. Studies will use Bim-reporter
and Bim-deficient mice, and Bim+/+ and Bim-/- human intestinal organoids generated from induced pluripotent
stem cells in both QQ and RR background. Aim 3 will investigate the role of MIF-CXCR2 axis in CDI-induced
tissue neutrophilia in QQ and RR mice. We will compare the effect of MIF on neutrophil trafficking and on their
lifespan. We will utilize neutrophils derived from WT and CXCR2-/- mice in in vitro (migration assays) and in vivo
(after depletion of endogenous neutrophils and reconstitution with labeled neutrophils prior to infection)
experiments. We expect these studies to provide a greater understanding of the role of host genetics in regulating
MIF during CDI pathogenesis. Our studies have the potential to identify new host-based targets that can be used
in the design of novel CDI therapies."
10914154,"The COVID-19 pandemic and the mitigation policies it prompted may have had profound consequences for the
psychological health of U.S. adults, including their risk of dying from drug overdose and suicide. To mitigate the
spread of COVID-19, some U.S. states enacted policies like stay-at-home orders and business closures. To
mitigate adverse economic and health effects, some states enacted policies like eviction moratoria and extended
unemployment benefits. These policies may have affected adults’ psychological health and related mortality
through social isolation, work-family conflict, interpersonal strain, economic wellbeing, employment disruptions,
and more. The overarching objective of this proposal is to rigorously assess how state-level COVID-19
mitigation policies have affected psychological health and related mortality from drug overdose and suicide
among working age and older adults. The project is significant and will have a sustained impact because it: 1)
identifies how states’ mitigation policies affect psychological health and mortality in both the short and longer-
terms, 2) leverages adults’ self-reports of how COVID-19 and mitigation policies affected their lives and
psychological health with county-level administrative data on drug overdose and suicide mortality, and 3)
empirically develops meaningful composite measures of state mitigation policies to assess their impact on
psychological health and mortality. The project is innovative in that it: 1) uses and extends novel survey data
from working-age adults on how the pandemic and its mitigation policies affected their lives, 2) uses recently-
developed methods for analyzing large contextual datasets containing high-dimensional and correlated data and
3) focuses on the impacts of policies on psychological health and related causes of death, specifically drug-
overdoses and suicides, in the short and longer terms. The project will accomplish its objective through three
Specific Aims. Aim 1 identifies how U.S. states’ COVID-19 policies are associated with adult psychological
health. It uses a new, national survey of U.S. adults aged 18-64 (National Wellbeing Survey) conducted in
Feb/Mar 2021 by PI Monnat. Using its self-reported data on how COVID-19 has affected people’s lives, we will
assess: a) how states’ COVID-19 policies predict individuals’ psychological health approximately one year after
COVID-19 began in the U.S., b) how economic, social, and health care conditions help explain the associations;
and c) how the associations vary by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and education. Aim 2 identifies how U.S. states’
COVID-19 policies affected fatal drug overdose and suicide rates at the county level. Using mortality data from
the National Vital Statistics System, we will assess: a) the immediate and lagged effects of states’ COVID-19
policies on county-level fatal drug overdose and suicide rates among adults aged 18 and older, b) how economic,
social, and health care conditions explain these effects, and c) variation by age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Aim 3
collects four new annual waves of the NWS, in close collaboration with the Consortium, to identify longer-term
consequences of states’ COVID-19 policies and individuals’ adaptations on adult psychological health."

K24 she has accomplished her stated aims of advancing her career as an expert in academic-community
partnered research focused on minority seniors, gaining new skills in implementation science, and expanding
the research platform and opportunities for her mentees. She has been highly productive, with 29 publications
led by her mentees, 4 mentored awards as primary mentor (including a Beeson, GEMSTAR and a Jahnigen),

Over the past several years Dr. Sarkisian's scientific work has increasingly involved partnering with public
health systems to reduce “low-value care” – tests and procedures with no benefit that often harm patients and
disproportionately affect older adults. She has a growing track record of high-impact publications in this area.
She has obtained NIA R01 and supplemental funding to support an interdisciplinary team at UCLA Health
working to implement electronic health record interventions informed by principals of behavioral economics to
reduce low-value care for older adults. In 2018, the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA launched a new

Support of this continuation would ensure Dr. Sarkisian can maintain protected time from increased inpatient
clinical obligations, allowing her to: 1) maintain her current momentum and advance her career as a sought-
after mentor and high-impact scientific investigator; and 2) gain new research skills to allow her to increase her
productivity as an independent scientist and impact as the Director of the UCLA VBCRC. Building upon her
expertise in academic-community partnered research, she seeks to advance her scientific career as an expert
in academic-health system partnerships in real-world settings to reduce wasteful spending, ensure that
patients receive appropriate and high-quality care, and reduce racial and ethnic disparities in the receipt of
high-value care. She seeks to solidify the VBCRC infrastructure as a platform for research for the next
generation of leaders in patient-oriented research in aging and a major contributor to the national dialogue on
how to reduce low-value care for older adults."
10927297,"Abstract:
Numerous investigations over the past decades have yielded substantial innovations in MR methods for the
characterization of extracranial carotid atherosclerosis. Images obtained with these innovations under ideal
conditions have given clinicians rich information about disease in the arterial wall and the hope for tools
critically needed for adequate management of this insidious disease. Despite this, the great potential power of
this technology has not made it into the routine clinical armamentarium. Indeed, because of the need for
gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCA), the long exam time (typically about 45 minutes to obtain the
multiple contrasts in the 5 or 6 necessary sequences), and the steep learning curve required to interpret multi-
contrast MRI most practitioners still revert to the simplified metric of diameter stenosis in assessing risk. After
many collective years of investigations, the consortium of investigators collaborating on this proposal believes
that the time is right to address these remaining limitations and ultimately shift the clinical paradigm.
Overarching hypothesis: To achieve the great potential in the management of cervical carotid disease, a
highly efficient and easily used MRI technique is required. Our hypothesis is that this can be accomplished
using multi-parametric non-contrast MRI sequences coupled with the latest high signal to noise ratio (SNR)
neck-shape-specific (NSS) RF coils and innovative machine learning (deep neural network) analysis methods.
Aim 1: We will install identical RF coils, MRI sequences, and protocols at each of our 5 participating centers as
well as rigorously test the accuracy of measurements and reproducibility of image quality from all centers. Aim
2: We will develop, train, and validate a user friendly, deep learning neural network system for the quantitative
analysis of several key components considered to be present in the vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque. Aim 3:
We will apply the analysis to a cohort of carotid disease subjects to establish the repeatability of the
quantitative measures, as well as the accuracy of characterization in comparison to histopathology. Although
we will develop and test the image quality, reproducibility and reliability in a network of highly skilled academic
centers, we will design these methods to be applicable in the community hospital setting. At the conclusion of
this project, we propose to have an integrated solution that can be used in subsequent investigations such as:
the effect of pharmacologic intervention in modifying the composition of the plaque; studying the evolution of
features of the untreated atheromatous disease over time; and, eventually, investigating the metrics that are
predictive of deleterious outcomes, and that can be used in improving intervention strategies in this population.
On successful completion, the RF coils and MRI sequences and analysis methods will be made available to
other imaging centers in a manner that ultimately changes the paradigm of diagnosis and managing the
treatment of cervical carotid atherosclerotic disease."

tissue type compatibility, minimize end-user processing, and allow adaptation into larger automation
workflows. Epigenetics is critical in regulating gene expression in healthy and diseased tissue cells.
Incorporating genome-wide epigenetics illuminates research into cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and
systems biology. Systematic epigenomic tissue analysis will allow researchers to bring to bear the power of
spatial multi-modal omics to a broad range of disease research. An epigenomics tool accessible to bench
scientists remains an unmet need. AtlasXomics launched the first genome-wide spatial epigenomics tool,
spatial-ATAC-seq, built on our Deterministic Barcoding in Tissue for spatial omics sequencing (DBiT-seq)
platform. An automatable version of our DBiT-seq device will provide this missing puzzle piece but requires
greater flexibility, throughput, and ease of use. Early adopters applied our assays to human melanoma, brain
cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases. Based on positive early adopter feedback, we have set key
objectives for a next-generation product with 1) improved ease of use, 2) greater flexibility for application to a
wider array of tissue types, 3) larger field of view (FOV) approaching single-cell resolution, and 4) at a lower
cost for large-scale epigenomics studies. To meet this critical need, AtlasXomics will develop a process
substantially reducing the end user’s process steps and pain points, delivering a widely accessible spatial
platform. We have developed a prototype FlowGel process using the current commercial consumable (25um
resolution, 2.5x2.5mm FOV) to map chromatin accessibility in fresh-frozen mouse brains. Once finalized, the
process and consumables will be transferable to all other AtlasXomics applications currently in development.
The positive results from this proof-of-principal study set the groundwork for AtlasXomics to deliver a more

We propose to further strengthen and sustain the successful Center of Biomedical Research Excellence
(COBRE) on Opioids and Overdose at Rhode Island Hospital and affiliated research institutions. The
motivation for this effort lies in the ongoing tremendous need for greater scientific understanding of the
mechanisms underpinning vulnerability to opioid use and overdose and a need for more effective interventions
to treat and prevent opioid misuse and overdose. We will approach these challenges through ongoing,
cooperative partnership among senior scientists and early career investigators across several complementary
disciplines. We will continue our unique and innovative mentoring strategy that, in addition to primary project
advising, provides junior faculty members with specialized mentorship and services that empowers
investigators to influence policy and practice through their research. Moreover, our four interdisciplinary cores
provide infrastructure, consultation, and additional support services to ensure the successful career
development of our Project Leaders. The long-term goal of the Center is to strengthen and sustain a critical
mass of investigators specializing in opioids and overdose that benefits affected populations and enhances the
competitiveness of affiliated investigators. The objective of this proposal is to strengthen and continue to
develop the COBRE Center and to support the research activities of junior Project Leaders to ensure their
transition to R01-funded scientists and enhance the critical mass of researchers. There are two Specific
Aims—one related to the strengthening of our disease-specific research center, and one encompassing three
Research Projects that are linked by the themes of opioids and overdose. Aim 1: Strengthen the cores
needed to further develop and sustain our thematic multidisciplinary center of research excellence on

critical public health importance."
10906667,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Cell polarity is essential to an array of processes, including transport of nutrients across epithelial layers,
chemotaxis, and development. Thus, defects in polarization can have dire physiological consequences. The
overarching goal of this proposal is to understand the role(s) of actin in polarity establishment in the developing
egg. Cytoplasmic actin meshes are observed in oocytes of mouse, Drosophila, starfish, and C. elegans, which
suggests meshes are a conserved feature that have diverged functionally, in some cases. The Drosophila oocyte
is an ideal system in which to study the actin mesh because the ovaries are large, facilitating cell biological and
biochemical examination in a genetically tractable model organism. The presence of the actin mesh and its
correctly timed removal are critical to polarity establishment. Little is known about the mesh makeup beyond the
two actin nucleators required to build it, Spire and Cappuccino, and a molecular motor that colocalizes with Spire
on vesicles, myosin V. Our knowledge about the mesh is limited by two technical challenges: 1) several stages
of oogenesis do not take place ex vivo and 2) many actin-binding proteins are essential to early oogenesis,
diminishing the power of classical genetics to discover mesh components necessary during mid-oogenesis. We
are developing an intra vital imaging platform to address both issues. Intra vital imaging will facilitate long-term,
direct observation of the mesh and its disappearance within the animal. When combined with Crispr/Cas9-
mediated gene editing and auxin-inducible-degradation, we will be able to observe changes in the mesh upon
removal of specific proteins in a temporally controlled manner. We will use these tools to test the hypothesis that
the mesh slows fluid flows to facilitate formation of a posterior anchoring structure that is necessary for polarity
establishment and fails to form when fluid flows are prematurely accelerated, as is the case if the mesh is
compromised. A comparable actin mesh, also built by Spire, Cappuccino, and myosin V, was recently discovered
in a somatic cell, the dendritic melanocyte. Interestingly, in the mouse oocyte, the mesh moves vesicles towards
each other and the periphery of the cell, whereas, in the melanocyte, the mesh moves vesicles apart, dispersing
them throughout the cell. By combining in vivo experiments with in vitro reconstitution of the mesh, we will
determine how the same set of proteins can drive vesicles in opposite directions in mouse oocytes and
melanocytes and determine how the mesh is built in the Drosophila oocyte. Finally, we will examine the
consequences of the recently-discovered interaction between Spir and myosin V, using complementary
biochemical and genetic approaches. Coordination between an actin nucleator and an actin-based motor has
exciting implications for how the mesh and other structures are built. Upon completion of this work, we will have
established how the mesh, a structure essential to cell polarity, is built, identified previously unknown mesh
components, and determined whether slow streaming is necessary for posterior anchoring. Now that we know
that actin meshes are not exclusive to oocytes, the implications of our findings are even broader."
10889051,"Multiple Myeloma (MM) bone disease remains one of the most dreaded complications of this still incurable
cancer. Osteoclast-activating factors produced by MM cells induce osteoclasts, cause excessive bone
resorption, and lytic bone lesions in ~80% of patients with poor healing even after achieving disease remission.
In an effort to screen for potential myeloma-derived factors that activate osteoclasts, we identified matrix
metalloproteinase 13 (MMP-13) to be highly secreted by primary MM cells and elevated in patients with bone
disease. MMP-13 dose-dependently induces extensive bone resorption in vitro and in vivo. In MM bone disease
mouse models, MMP-13 knockdown in MM cells significantly inhibits the development of lytic bone lesions,
confirming that MMP-13 is critical for the development of multiple myeloma bone disease. It is of particular
importance that MMP-13-dependent osteoclast activation occurs independently of its enzymatic activity, thereby
establishing a new paradigm in the regulation of bone resorption. In overview, we have shown that MMP-13
plays a pivotal role in MM-induced bone destruction.
We now have compelling evidence that immune checkpoint protein programmed death-1 homolog (PD-1H), a
transmembrane protein broadly expressed on various hematopoietic cell lineages, serves as a
previously unrecognized signaling receptor for MMP-13. We found that Pd-1h knockout in osteoclast blocks
MMP-13-induced osteoclast activation and bone resorption, suggesting that MMP-13 binding to PD-1H plays a
critical role in MM induced bone disease. Furthermore, we show that MMP-13 has a PD-1H mediated inhibitory
effect on T cell expansion. Mmp-13-/- antigen presenting cells have increased stimulatory capacity on
alloreactive T cells in vitro. In an in vivo model of alloreactivity, donor T cells expand significantly more in Mmp-
13-/- recipients, confirming that host MMP-13 expression mitigates the expansion of T cells.
It is the central hypothesis of this grant that PD-1H is the key receptor for MMP-13 signaling and mediates
its effects on osteoclasts, antigen presenting cells and T cells, resulting in bone resorption and
immunosuppression in MM. We propose the following 4 Aims: 1) Define the role of PD-1H as the MMP-13
receptor in osteoclasts; 2) Characterize the role of the MMP-13/PD-1H axis in skeletal remodeling and MM bone
disease; 3) Investigate the role of the MMP-13/PD-1H axis as an immune checkpoint in MM; and 4) Confirm the
role of MMP-13/PD-1H axis in MM bone disease and immunosuppression in MM patients. Together, our findings
highlight a previously unrecognized and new pathway of osteoclasts activation involving MMP-13/PD-1H axis
that links the bone disease with immunosuppression in MM. We propose that our work will form the basis for novel
treatment strategies in MM bone disease associated with suppressed immune response. Furthermore, this
research will help to better understand the interaction between MM bone disease and the myeloma immune
environment."

 Cumulative Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) and childhood socioeconomic disadvantage (SED)
have each been identified as major contributors to poor adolescent mental health and have been associated
with one another. However, less is known about how cumulative ACEs and childhood SED operate together to
influence adolescent mental health, resulting in disagreement among childhood adversity researchers. Without
a clearer understanding of this complex relationship, we risk overlooking largely impactful social factors that
influence adolescent health and well-being and our efforts to address the current youth mental health crisis will
be hindered.
 The purpose of this Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award (NRSA) Individual Pre-
Doctoral Fellowship in Nursing Research (F31) application is to prepare the applicant for a career as an
independent investigator focused on expanding our collective knowledge of social risk factors and informing
primary prevention strategies related to childhood adversity and adolescent mental health. The proposed
fellowship consists of two complementary components: 1) a training plan aimed at developing the applicant’s
methods proficiency, substantive expertise, and role attainment; and 2) a research project that will further our
understanding of the relationship between childhood SED, ACE exposure, and adolescent depression and
anxiety. A strong mentorship team that includes sponsors and collaborators from the University of Michigan’s
Schools of Nursing, Public Health, and Social Work, as well as consultants from UM’s Poverty Solutions and
School of Public Policy will provide interdisciplinary expertise in childhood adversity/trauma, child poverty,
youth mental health, policy advocacy, intervention implementation, and advanced statistical techniques.
 The proposed research project will utilize data collected as part of the large, diverse, longitudinal
Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study from birth through age 15. The specific aims are to: 1a) Investigate
for the presence of distinct profiles of ACE exposure during early childhood and how childhood SED predicts
profile membership; 1b) Examine the association between distinct ACE profiles and adolescent depression and
anxiety, and if childhood SED moderates these associations; and 2) Investigate for transitions in ACE profile
membership during early childhood, how childhood SED influences profile transitions, and how transitions are
associated with mental health. Additional exploratory analyses will be conducted to assess the influence of
additional social determinants of health, including race/ethnicity and biological sex.
 This study aligns with the NINR’s updated strategic plan by addressing health equity through the study
of key social determinants of health and well-being. Findings from this study are critical for shaping future
policy and research agendas, the allocation of scarce resources, and better identifying subpopulations in the
clinical setting that are at greater risk for poor mental health."
10794278,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The average American adult consumes over 40 pounds of sugar per year. While sugar intake is necessary for
energy metabolism and survival, this overconsumption has led to rampant obesity and diabetes. Therefore, it is
critical to determine the gut-brain circuit that drives sugar overconsumption. Recently, specialized sensory cells
in the intestinal epithelium, known as neuropod cells, were found to sense intestinal sugars and drive sugar
appetite. Neuropod cells sense sugars using sodium-glucose transporters (SGLTs). Most studies on intestinal
sugar sensing have focused on glucose transport ability itself, but little is known about sensing in the absence
of transport. Here, we will use an anti-diabetic molecule specific to human SGLTs to probe whether it is
glucose transport or sensing that is necessary to activate the neuropod cell sugar sensing circuit. My
hypothesis is that sugar sensing, in the absence of transport, will activate neuropod cells, causing glutamate
release and vagus nerve activity. Therefore, I am pursuing the following aims: 1) to determine whether specific
SGLT activation leads to neuropod cell glutamate release and 2) to determine whether an anti-diabetic
molecule leads to rapid, neuropod cell dependent vagal activity. My approach includes neurogenetic
manipulations of intestinal organoids and in vitro and in vivo electrophysiology. These studies may uncover a
pharmacological target for modulating rapid gut-brain control of food choice without perturbing life-sustaining
sugar absorption. My co-sponsors, Drs. Diego Bohórquez, Ph.D. and David D’Alessio, M.D., are experts in
neuropod cell nutrient sensing and hormone signaling in obesity, respectively. Consistent with their long-
established track record of mentorship, the proposed studies and training plan will provide me with the rigorous
scientific training and leadership skills necessary for a career as a physician-scientist based on gut-brain circuit
manipulation as a bariatric intervention."
10917083,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a prevalent condition which elicits an enormous
burden on patient mortality and healthcare spending. A significant unmet need exists to elucidate kidney-specific
insults driving the onset and progression of kidney injury in order to develop novel therapeutic strategies capable
of directly targeting renal pathology. Compelling evidence has suggested that altered metabolism within the
kidney proximal tubule is implicated in AKI. The work proposed in this fellowship application will critically evaluate
the role of a class of lipotoxic lipid species, termed ceramides, as drivers of mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative
stress, and lipid accumulation characteristic of multiple kidney pathologies. Human correlational data suggest
that altered tubular ceramide metabolism correlates with clinical kidney disease endpoints, such as kidney
fibrosis and estimated glomerular filtration rate. Previous reports indicate that renal ceramides are elevated in
pre-clinical models following kidney injury or in the setting of chronic disease, and preliminary data presented
herein demonstrate that whole-body depletion of ceramides successfully prevents acute kidney injury and
histopathology following renal ischemia reperfusion or obstructive injury. This application intends to address the
remaining gap in knowledge regarding whether local kidney ceramides play a role in disease mechanisms and
in which cell types. Specifically, the proposed project will determine if ceramides are candidate mediators of
metabolic dysfunction in tubular epithelial cells. In Aim One, we will probe for protection from kidney injury
incurred in novel mouse lines with genetic depletion of ceramides in the kidney tubular epithelium. Furthermore,
animals with genetic gain-of-ceramide within kidney tubules will be assessed for development of kidney
dysfunction and histopathology. Studies proposed in Aim Two will employ in vitro and ex vivo methods to
characterize novel mechanisms of ceramides driving impairment of mitochondrial bioenergetics and lipid
accumulation in kidney tubules and primary cells. Preliminary findings demonstrate that accumulation of
ceramides impairs mitochondrial respiration and ATP production in cultured immortalized proximal tubular
epithelial cells. This work will be the first investigation to directly assess if tubule-derived ceramides are
implicated in the metabolic perturbations preceding tubular injury and histopathology and will provide valuable
insight into the therapeutic potential of ceramide-lowering interventions for dominant causes of acute kidney
injury. Furthermore, completion of the proposed studies will greatly enrich the applicant’s pre-doctoral training,
mastery of technical skills (e.g., implementation and evaluation of kidney injury and disease models, evaluation
of mitochondrial metabolism and substrate utilization, and mass spectrometry-based analysis of ceramide
levels), and development as a young scientist pursuing an independent research career."

Many therapeutics for proliferative and neurodegenerative disorders, such as cancer and amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS), aim to disrupt or inhibit downstream signaling pathways components such as the MAPK cascade.
A critical barrier in therapeutic development against Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs) is that oftentimes
signaling pathways are interconnected, and this may lead to off-target side-effects. One method to mitigate these
challenges is to determine the mechanism of activation of membrane receptors that actively play a role in
abnormal cellular functions. RTKs, such as Erythropoietin-producing hepatoma (Eph) receptor 4, have been of
particular interest as potential drug targets. However, there is a lack of structural information on EphA4 that
provides insight into receptor activation. In this work, we aim to determine key structural differences during
activation of dimeric EphA4 as well investigate the activity of loss-of-function EphA4 mutants using
complementary fluorescence-based and structural studies to validate our findings. In aim one, we propose to
elucidate critical structural differences resulting in wild type EphA4 activation using cryo-electron microscopy
(cryo-EM). In aim 2, we propose to characterize aberrant activity and oligomerization of known EphA4 cancer
mutants through fluorescence-based studies, biophysical, and biochemical assays. The results of these aims will
contribute significantly to our underlying understanding of RTKs and will aid in efforts to develop EphA4
structure-based drug designs for proliferative and neurodegenerative disorders."

Obesity is a major cause of hypertension that imposes tremendous economic burdens. However, the underlying
mechanisms are largely unresolved. The goal of this proposal is to identify molecular and neuronal pathways
that contribute to obesity-induced hypertension. Overwhelming evidence from our lab and others support a
causal role for the adipocyte-derived hormone, leptin, in neurogenic hypertension associated with obesity. This
proposal is based on our recent identification of an intracellular signaling pathway and neuron population
required for leptin’s hypertensive actions. We hypothesize that leptin signaling on this neuron ensemble
hyperactivates pressor circuits and drives obesity-induced hypertension. To test our hypothesis, I will pursue the
following aims. Aim 1 will determine how a leptin signaling pathway in a cell-type specific neuron population
promotes dysfunction in obesity. I will use in vivo and ex vivo functional circuit mapping techniques to define how
this signaling pathway contributes to electrical properties and synaptic output relevant to cardiovascular
regulation. Aim 2 will investigate how obesity functionally reshapes downstream cardiovascular circuits. I will
combine in vivo physiological and chemogenetic techniques with ex vivo electrophysiology to identify cell-type
specific adaptations to obesity that contribute to hypertension. The proposed study will provide insights into novel
molecular and circuit mechanisms in obesity-induced hypertension. Moreover, these experiments may lead to
the identification of novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of obesity-induced hypertension."

Phthalates are a type of plasticizer that are used to make rigid polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastic flexible. In medical
devices, phthalate levels have been reported to be between 20-80% of a product’s weight depending on the type
of device; however, questions have arisen over their safety. The most common phthalate plasticizer used in PVC
medical devices is di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP). Patients undergoing cardiac surgery involving the use of
a cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) circuit are exposed to significant levels of DEHP from blood products, circuitry
tubing, bypass cannulas, and endotracheal tubes. Despite the immeasurable benefits of plastics – there is
increasing concern over the potential health risks of phthalate chemical exposures. Accordingly, there is an
urgent need to develop and adopt safer alternatives to be used in pediatric CPB. The proposed research
project will address this need by evaluating the cardiotoxic effects of DEHP on the pediatric heart and
investigating potential mitigation strategies to reduce exposure to toxic phthalate chemicals. Aim 1 will
assess the direct effects of phthalate plasticizers on human pediatric cardiac electrophysiology and contractility.
Aim 2 will determine the efficacy of potential mitigation strategies to reduce phthalate exposure and improve
cardiac outcomes. The latter will include investigating the cardiac safety profile of commercially available DEHP-
free alternatives and the utility of using cell washing to remove phthalate plasticizers from cardiopulmonary
bypass fluids. The results of this proposal will largely be applicable to the fields of cardiology, with the potential
to inform regulatory decision making over the use of phthalate plasticizers in medical device manufacturing. This
is particularly important for medical devices that are used to treat vulnerable neonates and infants undergoing
cardiopulmonary bypass. This application contains a three-year training plan that will further my scientific
development, by building upon the expertise of my Sponsor (Dr. Posnack with expertise in cardiac
electrophysiology and cardiotoxicity) and co-Sponsor (Dr. Ishibashi with experience in preclinical models and
pediatric cardiac surgery). I will also benefit from a broader group of collaborators, who will provide insight into
clinical relevance and experimental techniques. This training proposal will expand my scientific understanding of
pediatric cardiovascular physiology, plasticizer toxicity, and clinically relevant models while supporting my future
goal to lead a translational research laboratory at a top children’s hospital."
10738820,"Project Summary
The majority of Parkinson’s disease (PD) cases are not caused by an inherited monogenic mutation and
disease etiology involves a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Epidemiological studies show
that pesticide exposure, particularly to organochlorine pesticides such as dieldrin, increases risk of sporadic
PD. In a model of increased PD susceptibility, mice exposed to dieldrin during development show male-specific
increased susceptibility to adult exposure to the dopaminergic toxicant MPTP and, in new data from our
NIEHS-funded R21, α-synuclein (α-syn) preformed fibrils (PFFs). The epigenome is a potential mediator of this
relationship between developmental exposures, increased neuronal vulnerability, and adult disease. In line
with this idea, we recently identified sex-specific differential methylation patterns in response to developmental
dieldrin exposure. We hypothesize that dieldrin-induced epigenetic modifications during development
cause changes in gene expression and phenotype that persist into adulthood, altering the sensitivity
to parkinsonian insults and contributing to the development of PD.
To test this hypothesis, we will determine cell-type specific DNA modifications and expression profiles of
previously identified candidate genes in the dieldrin model (Aim 1); analyze the function of synaptic terminals in
our novel dieldrin/PFF two-hit model (Aim 2); and determine if dieldrin or altered expression of candidate genes
affects susceptibility to α-syn PFFs in a dopaminergic neuron cell culture model (Aim 3). The long-term goal
of these experiments is to determine whether dieldrin-associated differentially methylated genes play a
functional role in the biological response to parkinsonian toxicity.
Completion of these aims will further the mission of NIEHS to increase our understanding of how the environment
affects people in order to promote healthier lives, with a specific project goal of connecting exposures with
functional changes in gene expression, neuronal phenotype, and PD susceptibility. The experiments proposed
here will help to establish a biological mechanism linking developmental exposure to late life disease. This project
will also expand our repertoire of tools for interrogating the function of epigenetic changes by establishing an in
vitro experimental paradigm to connect specific epigenetic mechanisms with parkinsonian toxicity. With our in
vivo model that combines developmental exposure with adult PFF injections, we will have a set of experimental
systems in place that will allow us to test a wide variety of exposures, as well as combinations of exposures,
both in vivo and in vitro. Together, this suite of tools will enable us to explore the mechanisms by which PD-
related exposures alter neuronal vulnerability in PD, furthering the goal of NIEHS to understand how combined
exposures affect disease pathogenesis and individual susceptibility."
10913331,"The overall objective of this proposal is to investigate circular extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) as a potential
driver of intratumoral heterogeneity and treatment resistance in medulloblastoma, the most common pediatric
malignant brain tumor. Intratumoral heterogeneity is one of the leading determinants of therapeutic resistance
and treatment failure and one of the main reasons for poor overall survival in cancer patients. However, the
functional relevance of ecDNA as a driver of tumor heterogeneity and treatment resistance in medulloblastoma
has hardly been studied. To analyze the clinical impact of ecDNA in the different molecular subgroups of
medulloblastoma, we assembled a multi-institutional cohort of Whole Genome Sequencing data from 468
medulloblastoma patient samples. Using novel computational methods for the detection and reconstruction of
ecDNA, we found ecDNA in 82 patients (18%) and observe that the presence of ecDNA is associated with
significantly poorer outcomes. In addition, we find that individual medulloblastoma tumors often harbor multiple
variants of ecDNA, each containing different amplified oncogenes along with co-amplified non-coding
regulatory DNA (‘enhancers’). Based on our preliminary results, we propose the central hypothesis that ecDNA
drives intratumoral heterogeneity and treatment resistance in high-risk medulloblastoma patients. The central
hypothesis will be tested through the following three specific aims: To investigate the molecular evolution of
ecDNA as a potential driver of treatment resistance (Aim 1); To evaluate combinatorial therapies targeted
against mechanisms of ecDNA formation and clustering to reduce treatment resistance (Aim 2); To probe
medulloblastoma tumor-dependencies by functional inhibition of coding and non-coding regulatory DNA co-
amplified on ecDNA (Aim 3). The research proposed in this application has technical, conceptual, and
biological innovations, including the analysis of ecDNA on the single-cell level using novel imaging and
multiome single-nucleus sequencing methods in medulloblastoma tumors and in patient-derived xenograft
(PDX) models. The proposed research is significant, because the current standard treatment for children with
medulloblastoma causes developmental disorders, neurological damage, and secondary metastases. Novel
therapeutic approaches are urgently needed. Our approach will test the impact of standard-of-care treatments
on the molecular evolution of ecDNA and functionally test novel combination treatments targeted against
ecDNA genesis and clustering. These preclinical studies have the potential to uncover novel mechanisms by
which ecDNA contributes to the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma and to identify new scientific leads for the
development of improved treatments. We expect that our studies will expose the contribution of ecDNA
variants to the emergence of therapy resistance, reveal their selection advantages, validate recently described
properties of ecDNA and their therapeutic susceptibilities, and identify novel tumor-dependency genes
amplified on ecDNA in some of the most aggressive medulloblastoma tumors."

context of modern machine learning techniques, particularly models implementing attention mechanisms and
using large unlabeled datasets. There is growing penetration of deep learning approaches in the field of health
natural language processing. Our proposal aims to address critical methodological gaps and understudied areas

line community posts, and health-related social media. The evaluation of the methods we will develop will be
performed on the key clinical tasks of concept extraction, relation extraction, and phenotyping with comparisons
to other traditional or deep learning algorithms as baselines. We will demonstrate impact of our methods and
tools through several use cases, ranging from clinical point of care to public health, to translational and precision

To combat the US opioid epidemic, massive efforts have been focused on expanding access to medications
for opioid use disorder (MOUD). While there are indications of improved reach and adoption, an ironic gap
persists—only about one-third of specialty addiction treatment organizations offer MOUD. This proposal,
Stagewise Implementation-To-Target – Medications for Addiction Treatment (SITT-MAT), not only
advances the science of implementation, but advances our empirical understanding of how to best respond to
a substance-related epidemic. This is a revised application in response to PAR-19-274: Dissemination and
Implementation Research in Health” and aligned with the National Institute on Drug Abuse Strategic Plan
“ensuring the effective translation and implementation of scientific research findings to improve the prevention
and treatment of substance use disorders.” Within an adaptive implementation strategy trial design, using an
innovative stagewise implementation-to-target approach, 72 community addiction treatment programs will
participate. The stagewise implementation-to-target, stepped “care” type approach, deploys increasingly
intensive strategies only if needed. The sequence of implementation strategies are: 1) Enhanced Monitoring
and Feedback; 2) “NIATx/MAT Academy,” a 2-day workshop on MOUD and NIATx (Network for Improvement
of Addiction Treatment)—an evidence-based process improvement strategy; 3) Randomization to either NIATx
Internal Facilitation or NIATx External Facilitation; and, 4) If outcome targets are not achieved in the NIATx
Internal Facilitation arm, assignment to NIATx External Facilitation. We evaluate the relative impact of 5
possible paths of implementation strategies on RE-AIM target outcomes: reach, effectiveness, adoption, and
implementation quality. Maintenance of outcomes is evaluated for sustainment. Measures of multi-level
contextual determinants are rigorous and systematic. In opening the “black box” of implementation strategies,
we detail procedures, fidelity, participation and costs using standardized measures. The collective expertise of
the research team, the established partnership with a state system of care and addiction treatment
organizations, forecasts successful project execution. As we submit this application, the US is still coping with
the COVID19 pandemic. The global health situation may rebound to relative normalcy in the months from
December 2020. Meanwhile, the CDC, SAMHSA, CMS, and the State of Washington Health Care Authority
have all made accommodations to continue the initiation and management of MOUD for patients receiving
addiction treatment services. Therefore, even if the current quarantine restrictions persist, we do not anticipate
major modifications to the study protocol, except in-person implementation support activities would be
transitioned to videoconference formats. During this pandemic, it is even more critical for patients with opioid
use disorders to access pharmacological interventions that require minimal physical contact with providers.
This study has the potential to shift the paradigm in public health and implementation research."

effectively manage CRC disease in this setting. There are a variety of resource-intensive interventions for
addressing FEOC. However, implementing these in all newly diagnosed CRC patients would be unfeasible,
given the high patient volumes and existing resource constraints in the SA public healthcare sector. A clinical
prediction rule (CPR) is proposed for identifying newly diagnosed SA CRC patients who are at high risk of
FEOC, thereby enabling more efficient targeting of these specific, high risk patients for interventions which seek
to address FEOC. The CPR will be developed by: 1) Identifying potential predictors of FEOC in CRC populations
through a systematic review of the literature and a survey of 109 patients; 2) Constructing an appropriate
electronic data collection tool that will streamline prospective data collection for these potential predictors and
the study outcome, FEOC, from a cohort of 398 newly diagnosed CRC patients; and 3) Applying machine
learning methods to the data to derive and internally validate the CPR. The CPR will be an important first step
in tackling the high FEOC rates amongst newly diagnosed CRC patients in KZN, SA and will ultimately contribute
toward improving both CRC disease management and patient outcomes in this setting. The proposed K43
research has the potential to be scaled up to the national level, and this will be the basis of a future R01 grant
application. Dr. Moodley (K43 applicant) wants to become an independent gastrointestinal cancer epidemiologist
and a global leader in CPRs, particularly CPRs that seek to address breakdowns in linkage to care and reduce
the burden of disease attributed to gastrointestinal cancers, such as CRC. This award will provide him with
protected time to conduct the proposed research and engage in an intensive career development program while
based at one of the top universities in SA, the University of KwaZulu-Natal. He will be mentored by esteemed
senior researchers from SA (Prof. Thandinkosi Madiba, University of KwaZulu-Natal) and the US (Prof. Ravi
Pokala Kiran, Columbia University) who have a strong track record of mentoring young researchers. A research
advisory committee, comprised of other senior researchers, will provide additional research and career guidance
to Dr. Moodley. This will be coupled with didactic and “hands on” training in the core competencies required to
develop CPRs. It is envisioned that by the end of his K43 training, Dr. Moodley will have developed the proposed
CPR and generated new preliminary data. He will use this new data to successfully apply for an R01 grant, thus
establishing his independence as gastrointestinal cancer epidemiologist and a global leader in CPRs."
10906665,"Abstract
Over 150,000 HIV-1 infants are infected via mother to child transmission (MTCT) each year, accounting for
nearly 10% of the global annual HIV-1 infections. Even implementation of highly effective antiretroviral therapy
(ART) cannot prevent up to 5% of HIV-1 infected women from transmitting the virus to their infants. Thus,
approaches that synergize with ART will be needed to eliminate MTCT. The most promising interventions in
under clinical development to prevent HIV infection includes passive administration or active induction of
broadly-neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). Yet, paradoxically, broad neutralization activity in maternal plasma
has been associated with risk of infant transmission, raising concerns about the safety of these approaches in
pregnancy. Thus, a better understanding of the role of maternal neutralizing activity and MTCT risk is needed
to develop effective bnAb-based interventions, which together with ART can more effectively block MTCT.
HIV MTCT is a unique transmission route that occurs in the setting of preexisting antibody raised against
autologous viruses. We previously found that transmitted/founder (T/F) viruses in infants were more resistant
to neutralization by paired maternal plasma than non-transmitted maternal viruses. Moreover, we established
that bnAb activity in maternal plasma can drive the development of circulating viral escape variants that
become infant T/F viruses. We hypothesize that multispecificity of maternal plasma bnAb activity is associated
with reduced risk of MTCT and autologous virus escape from these functional responses by infant T/F viruses
is a risk factor for transmission. Moreover, identifying bnAb escape variants that are fit for transmission is
important to designing combination bnAb approaches that can effectively prevent virus transmission. We will
use the following three Specific Aims to test our hypotheses: (1) Compare the specificity and polyfunctionality
of plasma bnAb activity from transmitting and non-transmitting mothers to assess the role of maternal bnAb
activity in vertical virus transmission risk. (2) Determine if infant T/F viruses and circulating viruses of
transmitting mothers are more resistant to plasma neutralizing activity compared to that of non-transmitted
maternal variants from transmitting and non-transmitting mothers. (3) Define genetic signatures responsible
for escape from the maternal Env-specific B cell repertoire among transmitted infant Env variants using a
panel of native Env trimer-specific mAbs isolated from transmitting mothers. Defining the specificity and
function of pre-existing maternal neutralizing antibodies that can reduce virus escape and impede
transmission will be critical to design novel passive and active vaccine approaches that can eliminate HIV
transmission from mothers to infants, and is a tool to define the population impact of the future use of bnAb-
based prophylaxis on HIV transmission dynamics."
10932115,"The broad, long-term objective of this application is to advance primary prevention of stroke in patients at risk for stroke due to atherosclerosis of the carotid artery.  One to two percent of adults in the U.S. have asymptomatic atherosclerotic stenosis of the carotid artery exceeding 50% luminal narrowing. Carotid stenosis is often managed either by endarterectomy or stenting. About 100,000 carotid endarterectomies and 40,000 carotid stenting procedures are done each year in the US. Up to 90% of these procedures are done on asymptomatic patients. The findings of trials assessing the efficacy of revascularization begun in the 1980’s and 1990’s that showed efficacy of revascularization are now in question because of improvements in medical therapy to prevent atherosclerosis and atherothrombosis and concurrent improvements in revascularization by endarterectomy and by carotid stenting.  To address the question of how best to treat patients with ≥70% carotid bifurcation stenosis to prevent stroke, we are currently completing the first funding cycle for the CREST-2 trials. CREST-2 is a pair of parallel randomized, multicenter trials with the primary aims: 1) to compare the effectiveness of intensive medical management (IMM) vs. carotid endarterectomy plus IMM (n=1240), and 2) to compare the effectiveness of IMM vs. carotid stenting plus IMM (n=1240). The primary endpoint is a composite of any stroke or death within 44 days of randomization (periprocedural risk) plus ipsilateral stroke up to 4 years of follow-up. An important secondary endpoint is cognitive function, assessed periodically and by a centralized, standardized computer- aided telephone interview. Endpoints are assessed in a manner blinded to treatment assignment. IMM involves central management of vascular risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking and hyperlipidemia. Primary risk factor therapeutic targets are systolic blood pressure <130 mmHg and a low- density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level of <70 mg/dL. IMM also includes telephone-delivered periodic lifestyle coaching. Preliminary data show that the IMM has significantly favorably improved vascular risk factors across treatment arms. As of October 26, 2020, a total of 70% (1734/2480) of the required patients have been randomized across the US, Canada, and Spain. All procedures are performed only by rigorously credentialed surgeons and interventionists. IMM and revascularization procedures are being successfully delivered. Cross- overs and withdrawal from the study are within design assumptions, and the quality of the data is high. CREST-2 supports a companion ancillary study known as CREST-H (NCT03121209) that tests the cognitive implications of revascularization in patients with hemispheric hypoperfusion. We are requesting support to complete recruitment, complete follow-up of the cohort (2-years after recruitment of last patient), and report study results."

For over a year, residents of Bristol, Tennessee (TN) and Virginia (VA) have experienced significant exposure
to landfill emissions including volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as benzene, toluene, and hydrogen
sulfide. Ambient levels of these air toxics have been measured by the EPA and the Virginia Department of
Environmental Quality. Based on the concentrations found during these sampling events, a Plan of Action was
released on July 6, 2022 to begin incremental steps towards mitigating the air toxics emanating from the
landfill. This Plan of Action presents a critical opportunity to measure the impact of this environmental policy to
improve air quality and reduce odors. Since October 2021, Haynes (PI) has been developing a community-
academic research partnership with Bristol residents to identify research strategies to identify their indoor and
outdoor exposures and potential health impacts. The residents have reported their experiences as “an endless
nightmare,” with “non-stop odor that stays in the house,” and “its hard to breathe.” Given our partnership with
the City Manager and community residents, we are poised to evaluate the impacts of an environmental
policy to reduce air toxics and odors and evaluate the potential long-term health consequences related to these
exposures. We propose these highly time-sensitive specific aims: Aim 1: Characterize indoor and outdoor
concentrations of VOCs, including benzene and hydrogen sulfide in and around homes of Bristol, VA/TN
residents prior to the implementation of the mitigation action plan. Aim 2: Characterize indoor and outdoor
concentrations of VOCs and hydrogen sulfide in and around homes of Bristol, VA/TN residents after each
stage of the mitigation action plan in order to determine the impact of the various strategies to mitigate
exposures. Aim 3: Evaluate the impact of the landfill and the mitigation plan on odor detection, quality of life,
and stress of residents. This time-sensitive research is critical to inform future landfill mitigation efforts as
numerous communities across the country face challenges associated with municipal solid waste facilities."

With this Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award, the candidate – a psychiatrist with
strong background in clinical research – aspires to achieve the long-term goal of becoming an independent,
federally funded investigator who (i) uses a neuroscience-informed experimental medicine approach to identify
neurocircuit mechanisms and (ii) conducts clinical trials to develop the next generation of circuit-specific antide-
pressant treatments in order to ameliorate the public health burden of irritability, an important yet understud-
ied feature of depression that is associated with poorer quality of life and elevated levels of suicidal ideation.
Candidate proposes structured research experience and formal training in (1) ultra-high-field [7 Testa (7T)] func-
tional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), (2) the affective neuroscience of irritability [including the use of task-
based fMRI to model frustrative nonreward (FNR), an evolutionarily conserved response to omission of an ex-
pected reward], and (3) experimental therapeutics approach to conduct clinical trials with changes in neurocircuit
function as the outcome measure of interest, that will be supervised by a team of prominent experts in neuroim-
aging, psychiatric neuroscience and experimental therapeutics. To fill the knowledge gaps regarding the neu-
rocircuit mechanisms of irritability, candidate’s proposed research strategy aims to identify dysfunctions in neu-
rocircuitry that engender irritability (Aim 1) and determine how changes in neurocircuit function relate to changes
in irritability (Aim 2). The proposed study will enroll male and female adults aged 18-55 years [n=30 healthy
controls (HC) and n=60 adults with major depressive disorder (MDD)]. All subjects will undergo resting-state and
task-based 7T fMRI to characterize the (i) patterns of functional connectivity (Aim 1.1) and (ii) neural responses
to a behavioral task of FNR (Aim 1.2) that are associated with irritability (quantified with the 5-item irritability
domain of Concise Associated Symptom Tracking scale). The MDD cohort (n=60) will then be randomized to 2
weeks of twice-weekly intravenous infusions of either ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or midazolam (0.02 mg/kg) in a
double-blind parallel-arm fashion. Clinical assessments and MRI scans will be repeated after the last infusion to
evaluate pre-to-post treatment changes in neurocircuit function using resting-state (Aim 2.1) and FNR (Aim 2.2)
task-based fMRI with ketamine versus midazolam and to explore the association between changes in neurocir-
cuit function and irritability. Candidate’s didactic and mentored training in 7T fMRI, affective neuroscience, and
experimental therapeutic approach will enable successful execution of the research strategy. Research activities,
such as collecting, storing, analyzing, and interpreting data from MRI scans and from clinical assessments, will
provide valuable hands-on training. Successful completion of the proposed study will allow candidate to (1) ac-
quire expertise in the conduct of neuroscience-informed studies that use experimental therapeutics approach
and (2) generate pilot data in order to pursue NIH funding and build this highly innovative program of research."

Membrane proteins are responsible for controlling the passage of nutrients, waste, energy and information in
and out of cells. They are critical players in physiology and key targets for pharmacological regulation, however,
we lack a fundamental understanding of why these proteins are thermodynamically stable in cell membranes.
Simply put, why does a greasy protein surface find its greasy protein partner in the greasy lipid bilayer to
assemble faithfully into its stable, native structure? In order to investigate this question, the Robertson laboratory
has developed a robust and rigorous model system to study equilibrium protein association in membranes based
on the reversible dimerization of the CLC-ec1 Cl-/H+ antiporter. Through the development of fluorescence and
single-molecule microscopy approaches, it is now possible to experimentally conduct a full thermodynamic
analysis of the CLC dimerization reaction in lipid bilayers, yielding the free energy of association (ΔG°) and free
energy changes (ΔΔG) due to mutations or different lipid conditions. Recent advances have allowed us to study
CLC equilibrium as a function of temperature, enabling a van't Hoff analysis to dissect the thermodynamic
changes in enthalpy (ΔH°) and entropy (ΔS°) upon dimerization. In addition, we have developed methods for
measuring equilibrium kinetics of CLC dimerization in a tractable manner - in the membrane and in real-time.
With this foundation in place, the Robertson lab is primed to build a full molecular model of CLC dimerization in
membranes. In the next phase of this project, we will investigate the hypothesis that CLC subunits are driven to
associate due to differential solvent dependent driving forces in the associated and dissociated states, and that
the transition state involves a critical solvation/de-solvation step. We will investigate this along three distinct
aims, by building a theoretical model of the CLC dimerization free energy in membranes using computational
approaches (Aim 1), connecting the CLC sequence and structure to dimerization through experimental
measurements of thermodynamics and kinetics (Aim 2), and developing a guest-host approach to experimentally
and theoretically quantify the impact of mixed lipid composition on protein association equilibria in membranes
(Aim 3). Throughout each of these studies, we integrate experiments and theory hand-in-hand, enabling us to
make robust connections between physical driving forces and molecular mechanisms. Regardless of the validity
of our hypothesis, our studies will provide meaningful quantitative information to the study of membrane proteins
in membranes. Ultimately, we expect that the results from these studies will provide a foundation for the field to
build new strategies for targeting membrane protein stability and mis-folding based on fundamental physical
principles."
10906195,"HARP PROJECT 1 SUMMARY
Health risks associated with alcohol use in the context of polypharmacy (AP risks) are likely substantial,
particularly for people aging with HIV (PAH). Alcohol has known serious adverse interactions with many
commonly prescribed medications, including several antiretrovirals (ARVs). These interactive medications are
considered “potentially inappropriate medications” among those who drink (A-PIMs) and most PAH drink. They
also initiate polypharmacy (5+ medications) a decade earlier than uninfected individuals and both aging and
HIV reduce tolerance to the combined effects of alcohol and polypharmacy due to increased physiologic frailty.
AP risks are complex, interacting, and highly individual. They depend on the health outcome of interest, the
degree of physiologic frailty, the level of exposure to alcohol and polypharmacy, and underlying genetic liability.
Among PAH, risks for neuro-cognitive compromise and alcohol associated liver disease (AALD) likely increase
with any alcohol use in the context of polypharmacy and A-PIMs may be particularly problematic. Accounting
for physiologic frailty (VACS Index), using self-reported alcohol use (AUDIT-C) and employing multiple metrics
of polypharmacy (medication count, A-PIMS), we have begun to characterize AP risks associated with serious
falls, pneumonia, hospitalization, mortality and delirium. We now propose to extend this work among PAH and
uninfected individuals to include genetic liability and AP risk for AALD resulting in decompensated liver
cirrhosis (DLC), a critically important outcome given the hepatic metabolism of most medications, including
ARVs. Personalized medicine combines large-scale, real-world data, high-powered computing and data
analytics to summarize complex information on an individual level. Based on our prior work and in collaboration
with our extended expert network and Administrative/Data Analytic (ADA) Core, we will use data analytics to
develop personalized, accurate combined measure of AP risk for DLC and other patient outcomes considering
the role of physiologic frailty (VACS Index), A-PIMS, and genetic liability for pharmacogenomic interactions
(PGx-PIMS) (Aim 1). In Aim 2 we explore the role of genetic liability for unhealthy alcohol use by testing
whether a polygenic risk score (PRS) modifies AP risk or response to AUD treatment differentially by HIV
status. PRS from Aims 2 will inform further AP modeling (Aim 1) and evaluation of candidate repurposed
medications (Project 2, aims 1 and 2). Importantly, personalized AP risk must be effectively communicated to
optimize its impact on behavior change. Informed by our expert Risk Communication (Resource) Core (RCC),
we will implement personalized AP risk assessments in a series of theory-based Information-Motivation-
Behavioral Skills /Motivational Interviewing (IMB-MI) behavior change pilot studies to evaluate our approach
(Aim 3). Lessons learned will also be applied in pilots targeting PAH with alcohol use disorder (AUD) adding
repurposed medications for alcohol (Project 2, Aim 3)."
10906199,"HARP PROJECT 2 SUMMARY
Although rarely addressed by HIV healthcare providers, alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a major cause of
morbidity and mortality among people aging with HIV (PAH). There are only three Food and Drug
Administration-approved medications for AUD and these have had limited acceptability and uptake for several
reasons. HIV providers are unfamiliar with AUD medications and reticent to add an unfamiliar medication in the
complex context of pre-existing polypharmacy and physiologic frailty. Even in less complex contexts, the
effectiveness of these medications is modest on average, likely due in part to variations in genetic liability.
Further, despite PAH’s excess liability for hepatic injury from alcohol-associated liver disease (AALD), we lack
medications to mitigate this injury. As more people are aging with HIV and they continue to drink alcohol, there
is growing need to identify and evaluate candidate AUD and AALD medications that will be safe and effective
in the context of polypharmacy and physiologic frailty. Analyses of large scale, real-world data may help us
identify and evaluate candidate medications for repurposing (i.e., medications commonly used for other
purposes that may also decrease drinking or hepatic injury). Building on our strong collaborative history and
supported by the larger HIV and Alcohol Research center focused on Polypharmacy (HARP) Program, we will
apply innovative approaches to enhance timely discovery and initial evaluation of candidate repurposed
medications for AUD and AALD. In Aim 1 we apply Explainable Artificial Intelligence methods and systems
biology to data from the national Veterans Administration Healthcare (VA) electronic health record linked to
genetic data and public data to identify candidate repurposed AUD and AALD medications in the context of
gene networks, which may provide mechanistic details at the biological level. In Aim 2 we use data from the
well-characterized VA family of cohorts encompassing >60,000 PAH and millions of uninfected controls, to
conduct propensity score matched analyses to examine the safety and effectiveness of four candidate
medications (prazosin, pioglitazone, and verapamil for AUD and metformin for AALD) among PAH and
uninfected individuals. In Aim 3, informed by these analyses, our prior alcohol interventions in HIV treatment
settings, and in collaboration with the Risk Communication and Administrative/Data Analytic Cores, we will
conduct three pilot studies employing clinical pharmacist-delivered personalized risk messaging and identified
candidate medications to generate time sensitive data on the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of these
medications to address AUD or AALD. Together, these studies will collectively expedite the pipeline from
discovery to evaluation of novel medications to address AUD and AALD among PAH."

Located in South Florida (SoFL), the goals of University of Miami’s Clinical and Translational Science Institute
(CTSI) are to improve the health of our community, address health disparities, and promote health equity. The
CTSI accomplishes these goals by catalyzing the development, demonstration, and dissemination of
scientific and operational innovations that improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and quality of clinical and
translational research. This is done through bidirectional engagement of diverse stakeholders, including
patient advocates and community collaborators, to help identify gaps, challenges, and chokepoints in the
translational research process. In response, the CTSI develops and test stakeholder-driven resources, tools,
and interventions ultimately promoting the adoption and integration of those that are demonstrated to be
successful, through dissemination and implementation efforts. This work is shaped by three primary factors:
1) SoFL is characterized by complex and multifaceted diversity with respect to race, ethnicity, language,
immigrant status, socioeconomic disadvantage, and stigmatization. This complexity allows CTSI Hub
investigators to explore research questions difficult to conceptualize and evaluate elsewhere; 2) CTSI
prioritizes diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) in its scientific workforce and research
participants; and 3) CTSI has a strong, successful and sustained record of authentic community and
stakeholder engagement which facilitates multidisciplinary research that can successfully overcome the
translational pitfall of replicating existing inequities. The CTSI’s focus, scope of activities and aims are
grounded in an understanding of these factors and their complex interplay with one another. Together with
diverse stakeholders, the CTSI will: 1) support the development and dissemination of innovative resources and
services to increase the quality, efficiency, and effectiveness of research across the entire translational
research spectrum; 2) promote research collaborations aimed at facilitating and accelerating research to
improve community health, address health disparities, and promote health equity; 3) develop innovative
training programs to support a team science-oriented CTS workforce, from translational scientists to clinical
research professionals and key stakeholders; and 4) support CTS research responsive to these overarching
goals. Through these efforts, the CTSI expects to achieve significant improvements in the quality, safety,
efficiency, effectiveness, and informativeness of its Clinical and Translational Enterprise. The CTSI will then
broadly disseminate its acquired knowledge regionally and nationally to maximize impact and opportunity, both
now and in the future. By doing so, the CTSI accelerates bringing the benefits of translational science (more
effective treatments, drugs, devices, behavioral interventions, and medical procedures) to all people,
regardless of their identity or access.

Viral Production and CRISPR Engineering Core
The NEI UCSD Center Core Grant for Vision Research Viral Production and CRISPR Engineering Core is
focused on the production of adeno-associated virus (AAV) and lentivirus (LV) vectors to allow for genome
engineering in vivo. Over the last several years, Shiley Eye Institute faculty have been heavily invested in
using genetic tools like high-throughput functional genomic screening (e.g., Wahlin and Welsbie) and
human genetics (e.g., Weinreb, Ayyagari, Borooah) to identify genes involved in various ophthalmic
diseases, including glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and inherited retinal degenerations
(IRDs). To be able to study the function of these genes in rodent models of disease, it is necessary to
produce gain-of-function (GOF) and loss-of-function (LOF) conditions. By fusing Cas9 to transcriptional
activators and repressors, technologies like CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) and inhibition (CRISPRi), as well
as conventional Cas9-mediated mutagenesis, can be used to produce the necessary GOF and LOF
conditions. Moreover, novel CRISPR technologies are being developed therapeutically to edit specific base
pairs or rewrite larger sections of genome using homology-directed repair (HDR). The key to all of these is
the viral delivery of genes encoding these large Cas9 proteins as well as optimized guide RNAs (gRNAs)
that direct Cas9. Finally, AAV can be used to express cDNAs (independent of CRISPRs). In all cases,
faculty are using a variety of outside cores for AAV production, resulting in high costs, variable quality and
only a limited selection of reagents. The Viral Production and CRISPR Engineering Core has access to
compact regulatory elements that can be used to create all-in-one AAV vectors that deliver Cas9 as well as
guide RNAs. The Core has a suspension cell culture setup, AAV and LV HEK293F producer cells, Cytiva
AKTA Pure fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) system and BioRad digital droplet PCR (ddPCR)
system for AAV/LV production, purification and titering. There is a dedicated part-time technician and
extensive know-how regarding AAV and CRISPR engineering that will be available to faculty."

our long-term goal, addressing barriers that limit the recruitment and retention of a cancer research workforce
through early exposure to intensive research experiences, an innovative didactics curriculum, and peer
networking. The program focuses on 1) providing a mentored summer research intensive experience for
undergraduates; 2) providing a parallel OPSD PRIME Academy enrichment curriculum to enhance
understanding of FDQFHU research concepts and career paths in research; and 3) developing a peer networking

Eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of all psychiatric illnesses and profound health consequences
for those affected. Relative to their heterosexual peers, sexual minority women are at heightened risk of
developing an eating disorder, yet little is known about the risk factors contributing to this disparity. The
overarching goal of this Pathway to Independence Award is to gain advanced training and mentorship required
to launch Dr. Simone's career as an independent investigator who rigorously investigates the mechanisms
contributing to disparities in sexual minority populations. To achieve this goal, a multifaceted training plan
including coursework, training, mentorship, and research is proposed in: (1) community-based and community-
engaged research, (2) mixed-methods design and analysis, and (3) sexual minority health equity research. The
knowledge derived from this training plan will prepare Dr. Simone to execute the proposed research, including
three research aims and two data collection efforts. During the K99 phase, a mixed-methods case-control
study will gain a broad scope of population-specific eating disorder risk factors in sexual minority women (Aim
1) through rich quantitative assessments about eating disorder symptoms, sociocultural pressures and minority
stress, and video diaries that capture the response to discrimination, social pressure, and eating disorder
episodes in real time. The results from Aim 1 and the community stakeholder advisory board (n=6) will inform
the scope of the subsequent research. A well-known limitation of health disparity research is a lack of validated
measures for use with minority samples. In line with NIH priorities, during the R00 phase, a population-specific
measure of eating disorder risk factors will be developed (Aim 2) with guidance from the community advisory
board and pertinent themes from Aim 1. Cognitive interviews with 30 sexual minority women will elucidate the
content validity of each item. The psychometric properties of the scale will be derived from the Aim 3 sample.
Finally, the temporality of associations between population-specific risk factors and eating disorder behaviors
and the extent to which such relations differ by sexual identity (e.g., queer, lesbian), race, and ethnicity (Aim 3)
by employing a daily process ecological momentary assessment in a case-control study. The proposed novel
mixed-methods research will elucidate population-specific eating disorder risk factors in an understudied
population, sexual minority women. Identification of population-specific risk factors and their associations with
eating disorder symptoms in racially and ethnically diverse sexual minority women will produce guidelines for
community programs and intervention efforts to rectify disparities, and the proposed measure will enhance
surveillance of population-specific eating disorder risk and advance future research of such mechanisms. This
award will launch the PI's independence by laying a foundation for a career in innovative multi-method
research that may be applied to additional mental health outcomes wherein disparities are present and with
other diverse sexual and gender minority populations."
10823316,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of genomic loci that increase disease
susceptibility for schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BP). We and others have shown that integration of
functional molecular data, including transcript abundance levels, can be used to decipher causal insights from
GWAS-identified allelic variant to gene to disease susceptibility. The identification of genetic risk factors and
causal interpretations provide the greatest potential for the future of personalized genomic medicine. These
studies and advances, however, have mostly been performed in individuals of European ancestry, thereby
exacerbating health disparities of most vulnerable populations of diverse and admixed genetic ancestries. At this
time, NIMH is leading the effort for genetic discoveries in underrepresented populations through funding of large-
scale GWAS projects of SCZ and BP, but it is necessary to simultaneously increase the genetic diversity of
functional molecular data for data integration and deciphering causal biological effects involved in SCZ and BP.
We will tackle the lack of diversity in integrative transcriptomic studies for the deciphering of genetic susceptibility
of SCZ and BP in Latino admixed populations, through deliberate integration of novel statistical method
development with new transcriptomic data generation. We will generate transcriptome data in 1,500 Latino
individuals (500 SCZ cases, 500 BP cases, 500 controls) as a public resource to generate new insights about
the molecular mechanisms that contribute to risk of SCZ and BP. At the same time, we will develop new statistical
methods that leverage the admixture process to improve the power of mapping genetic effects on expression in
Latino individuals. We will incorporate the local and global genetic ancestries within admixed individuals to
increase power of transcriptome-wide association (TWAS) and expression quantitative trait score (eQTS) studies
to identify novel susceptibility genes. We will integrate new transcriptomic data in Latino individuals with ongoing
Latino GWAS of SCZ and BP involving tens of thousands of Latino individuals both to generate new biological
hypotheses and to validate our new statistical methods. The most promising causal variants and susceptibility
genes will undergo functional validation. Our efforts will result in a large public gene expression resource, novel
statistical tools, and new biological findings validated in functional assays. Our findings may yield clinically
relevant applications for diagnosis and treatment for SCZ and BP particularly in Latino individuals that have been
traditionally underserved in large-scale genomic studies."

to long-term survival of lung transplantation. However, prediction and early diagnosis of CLAD using
current techniques continues to be problematic due to lower sensitivity (HRCT) and specificity
(circulating biomarkers). Currently, the reference standard to detect acute rejection is a
histopathological grading of transbronchial biopsies (TBBs), however, it is an invasive technique with
several limitations (bleeding, inconsistent outcomes, inherent risks associated with repetitive
procedures) including detection at advanced stages of the disease. Therefore, agents capable of
offering non-invasive assessment of chronic rejection after transplantation are a highly desirable
diagnostic nuclear medicine resource, yet continues to be an unmet need. To accomplish this
objective, we have developed a new PET tracer (named as 68Ga-Galuminox), which offers noninvasive
assessment of acute lung injury, and also demonstrates promising higher uptake in alveolar
macrophages of mouse ex vivo lung transplant model of CLAD, and human lung recipients with a
CLAD diagnosis compared to CLAD free subjects. Finally, preliminary 68Ga-Galuminox preclinical
PET imaging in our mouse CLAD model has revealed (at 30 min post tail-vein injection) 2-fold higher
retention in the left transplanted lung with early signs of CLAD when compared to the non-diseased
(untransplanted) right lung. Notably, these observations are also consistent with the observed
activation of macrophages and PMNs in CLAD lungs as measured by flow cytometry that identifies
single cell Galuminox uptake by detecting its native fluorescence. Armed with this supporting
information, aims of our preclinical translational RO1 are: Aim 1: Aim 1: Perform radiation dosimetry
to determine human effective dose equivalent (HED), toxicology studies, and GMP validation runs for
Galuminox to prepare for an IND filing; Aim 2: Perform first-in-human studies using 68Ga-Galuminox:
evaluate dosimetry, biodistribution, safety, and imaging characteristics following a single injection at rest
(n=8, 4 males; 4 females); and Aim 3: To evaluate performance of 68Ga-Galuminox and 18F-FDG for
detection of CLAD pathogenesis in a mouse model of lung transplantation; Aim 3.1: To determine if
68Ga-Galuminox can detect early and late CLAD pathogenesis; Aim 3.2: To determine if 68Ga-
Galuminox can be used to evaluate responses to CLAD treatment; and Aim 3.3: Biochemically
characterize mechanism(s) of location of the 68Ga-Galuminox through cell accumulation, sub-cellular
fractionation studies, pharmacokinetics, and LPS-induced inflammation either in presence or absence
of mitoTempo (MTT) and Dexrazoxane (DEX) in rodents to assess its ability to serve as noninvasive
molecular imaging agent for monitoring lung injury. Successful accomplishment of proposed aims
could enable: a) deployment of a noninvasive redox-sensitive reporter probe as a diagnostic tool for
stratification of patients with a risk factor for CLAD; b) potentially new interventional opportunities; c)
enabling longitudinal studies of disease pathology; and d) monitoring therapeutic efficacy of drugs.
Combined factors could significantly advance management of CLAD patients with potential detection
of CLAD at earliest stages."

Pediatric T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pT-ALL), with limited treatment options, has been historically
associated with inferior treatment outcomes with chemotherapy, compared to B-cell ALL. Despite the advances
made in our understanding of the etiology of pT-ALL, the overall survival of this disease has not significantly
improved. Children with recurrent T-ALL have a dismal survival rate of < 25%, and long-term survivors have an
increased burden of disease associated with the curative chemotherapies they received. Therefore, novel targeted
therapeutics in combinations are much needed. Population-based genomic and transcriptomic studies have
revealed the inter-leukemia diversity of pT-ALL. However, very little is known about intra-leukemia clonal
heterogeneity in pT-ALL that were known to contribute to drug resistance and disease recurrence. For example, it
remains mysterious what molecular and cellular features of the rare clones have to allow them to survive treatment
as other major clones are eliminated. T-ALL arises during the dynamic developmental processes and retains
hallmarks of their cellular origins. However, it remains unclear how T-cell development contributes to clonal
heterogeneity of pT-ALL. Moreover, whether cell–cell communications between cancer cells and normal cells in
the tumor microenvironment contribute to disease recurrence is unclear. Using bulk systems pharmacology and
single-cell systems biology approaches, we discovered the leukemia heterogeneity associated with T-cell
maturation and drug sensitivity in single cells. Therefore, we hypothesize that clonal therapy by targeting signaling
networks in clonal subpopulations arising from T-cell differentiation will minimize relapsed/refractory diseases and
improve outcomes for pT-ALL. Our team at St. Jude is uniquely positioned to tackle these challenges, capitalizing
on vast expertise in systems biology, ALL pharmacogenomics, and T-cell development. Specifically, in this
proposal, we will determine how T-cell development contributes to the intra-leukemia heterogeneity in pT-ALL
(Aim 1). We will map clones in pT-ALL to T-cell maturation stages by single-cell analyses of primary samples
and normal developmental T cells. We will identify clone-specific hidden drivers that drive clonal heterogeneity
and drug sensitivity. Next, we will identify drug combinations that target signaling drivers in multiple clones
(Aim 2). We will integrate bulk systems pharmacology with single-cell hidden-driver analyses to unbiasedly
predict synergistic drug combinations and validate them by drug screening. We will use patient-derived
xenografts that retain clonal complexity for in vivo validation. We will also investigate how TME reprograming
modulates clone selection with treatment in pT-ALL (Aim 3). We will reconstruct the tumor and TME
communication network from scRNA-seq data and elucidate the molecular mechanisms of clonal selection with
treatment in pT-ALL. Taken together, this project will address fundamental unanswered questions in intra-
leukemia clonality and provide a new clonal therapy approach that eliminates multiple clones, including those
that contribute to disease recurrence, thereby, improves the outcomes for children with T-ALL."

Childhood obesity represents a substantial burden on morbidity and is a major risk factor for cardiovascular
disease. Racial and ethnic minorities and children from disadvantaged backgrounds suffer a disproportionate
share of the national obesity burden. Despite availability of proven-effective interventions for childhood obesity
management, effective interventions are underutilized and there remains a substantial gap in the adoption of
evidence-based practices in settings that care for low-income children and populations with high burden of
social risk factors. This K24 renewal application will support equity-focused implementation research to
improve the adoption of effective childhood obesity interventions among clinicians and families and reduce
obesity disparities among low-income, racial/ethnic minority children. This application will take advantage of a
newly-funded, NHLBI R01 implementation research grant to optimize integration of the Connect for Health
pediatric weight management intervention in pediatric primary care settings. With NHLBI funding, we are
testing key adaptations and strategies that will support the implementation of Connect for Health across health
care systems in Massachusetts that deliver care to low-income children. K24 funding will allow the PI and her
mentees to extend and amplify the NHLBI study by examining a new adaptation: use of social- and
neighborhood risk-informed obesity care plans to increase the effects of childhood obesity interventions on
obesity outcomes. The overall goals of this K24 renewal application are to provide Elsie Taveras MD, MPH
with protected time to serve as a mentor to junior clinical investigators in their progress toward becoming
independent patient-oriented investigators, and to support new scientific aims that will build upon Dr. Taveras’s
established work on childhood obesity, health disparities, and equity-focused implementation science. Dr.
Taveras is Professor of Pediatrics and Nutrition at Harvard Medical School and Harvard T.H. Chan School of
Public Health, and a pediatric obesity specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital for Children. She leads
several large patient-oriented research studies including a NHLBI-funded implementation study that will serve
as the basis for her proposed aims. Dr. Taveras has already successfully served as a research mentor to more
than 40 MD and PhD candidates and clinicians in training. Her original K24 focused on understanding the
contextual roots of childhood obesity disparities and developing interventions to prevent and manage obesity.
This K24 renewal award is a natural extension of this work and will shift focus to translational studies and
implementation science. The K24 renewal will heighten Dr. Taveras’s research productivity in the area of
childhood obesity disparities and help foster the careers of junior childhood obesity scientists through her
mentorship. The proposed scientific aims of this K24 application will serve to strengthen Dr. Taveras’s ability to
provide mentorship to junior investigators in patient-oriented research, with an emphasis on equity-focused
implementation research to improve adoption and effects of childhood obesity interventions."

 Many individuals with cognitive impairment experience decrements in everyday function that can signal
encroaching dementia. For every year that cognitive decline is delayed there is substantial savings in patient
care costs and inestimable savings in quality of life for patients and family members. The prevalence of
cognitive impairment in chronic stroke is approximately 50%. A number of techniques have been found to
improve various aspects of cognition in the training situation. However, their transfer to everyday situations
outside the training setting has been limited as is retention. They are therefore of reduced or narrow practical
value. A cognitive ability that is improved but not used to enhance real-world performance has limited
significance. Pilot work has been carried out here with a novel intervention designed to fill these crucial gaps.
The results are very promising. The purpose of the proposed research is to carry out a randomized controlled
trial (RCT) with a large enough sample to rigorously evaluate these preliminary results.
 The new treatment to be tested combines two repeatedly validated rehabilitation methods: the Transfer
Package of CI Movement Therapy and Speed of Cognitive Processing Training. The purpose of doing so is to
produce a marked enhancement in the transfer of cognitive improvement from the training setting to
instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) in everyday situations. Both halves of the new combination therapy
are founded on the investigators' own basic research. In both cases, efficacy is supported by positive results
from multiple single-site RCTs and a large multisite RCT. However, the effect of Speed of Processing Training
has been found to have limited generalization to cognitive-based IADL in everyday situations. In contrast, one
of the main strengths of CI Therapy is that it produces a robust and extensive transfer of treatment effect to
everyday life situations by means, in part, of its Transfer Package. A second strength of the Transfer Package
of CI Therapy is long-term retention of its effect. In our initial work, the Transfer Package procedures that this
lab has used effectively to transfer motor gains from the treatment to everyday setting were adapted to transfer
cognitive gains from the treatment to the everyday setting.
 We propose here an RCT with 2 arms: Speed of Processing Training (SOPT) in the lab combined with
the TP (TP+) and SOPT in the lab but without the TP (TP-). Participants will be 120 adults more than 1-year
post-stroke with mild to moderate cognitive impairment. Performance on cognitive-based tasks will be
measured in daily life and in the lab before and after baseline, after treatment, and 6- and 12-months
afterwards. This design will permit rigorous testing of the value of the Transfer Package with an adequate
sample size, objective measurement, blinding, and between-subjects control for amount and intensity of
training and therapist contact."
10898878,"SUMMARY – CORE A
Core A is the administrative core, with the following broad objectives: First, Core A will maintain and strengthen
the internal structure of the PPG research team. The goal will be to work with PPG investigators to develop
priorities and support adherence to these priorities, facilitate planning and implementation of meetings, allow
for data transfers, and ensure that members of the team collaborate effectively with others, thus avoiding
duplication of effort or poor communication. Second, Core A will ensure that all members of the research team
keep up with cross-disciplinary developments and methods, and that they maintain a strategic focus on future
research developments. There are continuous ongoing developments in the large number of disciplines that
are either central to, or touch on our research; it can be challenging to maintain knowledge in these areas. To
respond to this, Core A will continue to host research retreats, which will be attended by both PPG key
personnel and non-PPG researchers with innovative work in related areas. Core A will also oversee the
continuation of an external advisory board to provide input on the future directions of the PPG, but with new
membership, including scientists with expertise in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD); health
care delivery and health equity; and patient, family, and community representatives. Third, Core A will oversee
the wide distribution of research results and will foster connections across institutions and disciplines. The
goals will be to disseminate current research through conference presentations and publication in peer-
reviewed journals in relevant disciplines, to provide information about the use of claims data to the wider group
of healthcare researchers, to continue interactions with authorities and experts on health care policy, to
maintain a website for dissemination of Dartmouth data, and to continue the PPG’s support of Dartmouth’s
Dataverse website to ensure reproducibility and rigor in research. Finally, Core A will create a platform to
consider and approve funding for pilot projects that encourage new and innovative research. This PPG has
budgeted funds to encourage pilot studies related to the PPG research agenda and targeted support for
developing supplement applications from scientists historically underrepresented in NIH-funded research."
10898879,"SUMMARY – CORE B
This PPG competitive renewal proposes four projects that, together, seek to identify and characterize the
causes and consequences of inequity in the delivery of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD)
healthcare services. The Data and Analytics Core (Core B) is responsible for the comprehensive ADRD-
specific data management and analytic support required to design and execute these projects. To meet these
goals, Core B will create: (1) a comprehensive database with sufficient power to characterize detailed patterns
of healthcare utilization, (2) a broad array of measures drawn from diverse sources that can augment these
data, (3) the analytic capacity, expertise, and oversight to ensure timely, high-quality design and execution of
analyses and creation of analytic datasets, and (4) appropriate access to these resources for other
investigators including common definitions of ADRD, data repository of coded qualitative data, and a legacy
plan to ensure that the data curation is easily understood, accessed, and documented for future research. The
specific aims of Core B are: (1) To maintain a comprehensive and secure database of administrative data
including Medicare and Medicaid enrollment files, claims records, supplementary files, as well as qualitative
data as identified by each Project Leader; (2) To create shared resources and measures—including ADRD
cohort definitions, code libraries, and interview guides—for use across all projects; (3) To provide study design,
data collection, and data analysis technical support and analyst effort for quantitative and qualitative aims
across all four projects; and (4) In coordination with Core A, to make the research files developed under this
PPG available to the broader research and policy community, and to facilitate data triangulation across the four
projects. All four projects will interact with Core B in four ways. First, the projects will be responsible for
developing and testing new measures and methods that then become part of Core B’s repository for
production and dissemination among the investigators. Second, each project will use analytic datasets and
data collection, management, and analytic support created through Core B personnel. A major enhancement to
this renewal is the introduction of qualitative and mixed-methods data management and analytic support to
build upon existing methods (based on Medicare claims) and link to newer resources developed under this
renewal. Third, the leadership of Core B will be responsible for fostering a collaborative environment in which
analysts and investigators continue to work seamlessly to generate data and research of the highest caliber.
Finally, because of Core B’s involvement in all four projects, personnel will be able to leverage early- phase
methods and findings to help inform questions or triangulate with data collected in later phases across all
projects."
10925305,"The Colorado Specialized Center of Research Excellence (SCORE) on Sex Differences and Women’s Health
is focused on Bioenergetic and Cardiometabolic Consequences of the Loss of Gonadal Function. The
overarching scientific goal of the SCORE is to address gaps in knowledge of the impact of gonadal aging on
the regulation of energy homeostasis and metabolism by conducting mechanistically driven research across
the basic-to-clinical translational spectrum. The scientific premise is that gonadal aging, through the
accompanying decline in sex hormones, mediates biological changes that increase risk for chronic disease.
Importantly, because gonadal failure is inevitable in women in mid-life, but rare in men until much later in life,
this meets the objective of the SCORE Program to study sex differences that impact women’s health. The
Colorado SCORE is focused on the increased propensity for abdominal fat accumulation and the associated
cardiometabolic dysfunction that are consequent to the loss of ovarian function. The overarching educational
objective is to engage new investigators in research aligned with the focus of the SCORE. The SCORE will
provide mentored career development and training on how to conduct research that appropriately addresses
sex as a biological variable (SABV). These overarching objectives will be accomplished through the following
Aims: 1) Advance novel translational research on mechanisms that are postulated to contribute to the
abdominal adiposity and cardiometabolic dysfunction that accelerate following estradiol withdrawal. All projects
include a focus on the kynurenine pathway because of the emerging evidence that it regulates energy
homeostasis, metabolic function, and the aging process. The Colorado SCORE investigators are experts in
these areas and are exceptionally well positioned to advance this research. 2) Attract and support outstanding
early career investigators with research interests related to the SCORE and engage them in CEC training
activities that will successfully advance their careers. The SCORE will support one Scholar and four Pilot
Project Awardees each year. 3) Provide infrastructural support for the SCORE Research Projects, Scholars,
and Pilot Awardees through the LAC, including biostatistics, data management, financial oversight, and
administrative support. 4) Partner with and leverage resources provided by other programs at CU-AMC
(Multidisciplinary Center on Aging, Ludeman Center for Women’s Health Research, Nutrition Obesity Research
Center, Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute) to elevate the visibility and multi-disciplinary reach of
women’s health research and the importance of investigating SABV. Activities will target both scientific and lay
communities at local, regional, and national levels. Achieving these Aims will position the SCORE as a
national leader in women’s health research, and the CEC as a model program for training the next
generation of scientists to integrate SABV in their research with a goal of improving women’s health."
10925316,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Menopause accelerates cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk due to changes in the hormone environment and
adverse changes in cardiometabolic function. The overarching objective of the Colorado SCORE is to
advance scientific knowledge of the impact of gonadal aging on the regulation of bioenergetics,
abdominal adiposity and cardiometabolic function. We have shown that age-associated vascular
endothelial dysfunction, a key antecedent for the development of CVD, is accelerated with gonadal aging in
women. We also demonstrated that the menopausal-related decline in estradiol (E2) triggers the development
of oxidative stress-mediated endothelial dysfunction. Endothelial function, measured by brachial artery flow-
mediated dilation (FMD) decreased with short-term ovarian suppression (via gonadotropin releasing hormone
antagonist, GnRHANT) in premenopausal women and this was reversed with E2 add-back. Prior SCORE
research demonstrated that long-term ovarian suppression results in a marked increase in abdominal
adiposity, particularly visceral, that is prevented by E2. How these adverse changes in adiposity influence
vascular aging with E2 deficiency is unknown. Additionally, the mechanisms underlying the increased adiposity
and impaired endothelial function in response to the withdrawal of E2 are not completely understood. Emerging
evidence links the tryptophan-kynurenine (TRP-KYN) pathway to the regulation of vascular function,
adiposity, and the aging process. Our preliminary data in men suggest that increased plasma KYN is
associated with increased adiposity and endothelial dysfunction in older men with low testosterone. It is
unknown if E2 regulates the TRP-KYN pathway in vascular and adipose tissues. Accordingly, Aim 1 will
investigate the impact of increased abdominal visceral adiposity superimposed on the effects of E2
withdrawal on endothelial function. FMD and visceral fat area will be assessed before and after ovarian
suppression with randomization to either E2 or placebo add-back. In collaboration with Projects 2 and 3, Aim 2
will determine if tissue-specific alterations in the TRP-KYN pathway are mechanistically linked to
increased adiposity and endothelial dysfunction with E2 withdrawal. TRP-KYN metabolites and key
enzymes in the pathway will be measured in blood, peripheral vascular endothelial cells, adipose tissue and
isolated adipocytes acquired before and after the intervention. In collaboration with Projects 2 and 3, an
Exploratory Aim will further examine the mechanistic role of TRP-KYN metabolism with E2 suppression on
endothelial function using an ex vivo serum exposure cell culture model and by conducting vasodilation
studies of arteries from animals in projects 2 and 3 with varying E2 status. Collectively, Project 1 will provide
unique mechanistic insight by which acute and more chronic loss of ovarian function contributes to increased
adiposity and endothelial dysfunction and will identify novel therapeutic targets to attenuate/prevent
menopause-related cardiometabolic dysfunction and reduce the risk of CVD."
10834817,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Parental emotion-related socialization behaviors (ERSBs)—including parents’ reactions to their children’s
emotions, parents’ emotional expressiveness, and parents’ conversations with their children about emotions
(reminiscing)—shape and maintain children’s emotion regulation (ER), a multifaceted construct comprising
cognitive, behavioral, and physiological processes for monitoring, evaluating, and modifying emotions to
accomplish one’s goals. As emotion dysregulation is a transdiagnostic risk factor for psychopathology, the
elucidation of specific pathways by which children develop adaptive ER, or conversely, emotion dysregulation,
is critical. Parents’ own ER may lead to their engagement in ERSBs and their children’s ER development, but
longitudinal research examining these associations is limited. Even more, minimal research has delineated the
specific aspects of parental ER that are most relevant for ERSBs, and the specific aspects of children’s ER that
are most affected by ERSBs. Indeed, multimethod ER assessment is critical because ER is a multifaceted
construct. Still, research has yet to comprehensively examine how each aspect of parental ER (resting
respiratory sinus arrhythmia [RSA], RSA reactivity, self-reported emotion dysregulation, cognitive reappraisal,
expressive suppression, and ER strategy repertoire) may relate to ERSBs (reactions to children’s emotions,
expressiveness, and sensitive reminiscing) and children’s ER (resting RSA, RSA reactivity, mother-reported
adaptive ER and lability/negativity, behavior during a frustration task, and self-reported coping and ER strategy
repertoire) over time. Thus, longitudinal, multimethod research is necessary. A low-income sample of 6- to 8-
year-old children and their mothers will complete questionnaires and tasks assessing ER and ERSBs. RSA will
be assessed among dyads before and during reminiscing and emotion-induction tasks. Dyads will be assessed
longitudinally with a repeated measures design 6 months and 1 year after their initial visit. The study is guided
by two aims: (1) Evaluate which aspects of maternal ER are most relevant for maternal ERSBs over time; (2)
Evaluate the influence of maternal ER on child ER over time, and the extent to which maternal ERSBs mediate
that association. This research will enhance theoretical accounts of the psychobiological processes of
caregivers that shape ERSBs and children’s emerging ER. In addition, this research will inform public health
efforts to improve children’s ER and psychological functioning by identifying processes (i.e., maternal ER,
ERSBs) that may be targets for translational programs aimed to improve children’s ER and reduce risk for
psychopathology. Goals of the fellowship training plan, which will take place at the University of Notre Dame,
include: (1) develop a comprehensive understanding of the emergence and manifestation of parental ERSBs;
(2) increase knowledge of ER development and assessment from childhood through adulthood; (3) expand
quantitative expertise in longitudinal analysis methodology; and (4) engage in professional development
activities and training in research ethics related to working with at-risk families."
10873711,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Studying genetic contributions to dementia risk from both the population-specific and trans-ancestral
perspectives is vital to disease prediction, characterization, and the development of treatment interventions.
Late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD) is the most common form of dementia, costs the United States an
estimated $305 billion in associated costs, and affects approximately 6 million individuals nationally, and more
than 24 million people globally. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is the strongest known genetic risk factor for LOAD.
Specifically, ApoE-associated LOAD risk is driven by a risk variant of ApoE (termed ε4 or ApoE4) while ApoE-
associated LOAD protection is thought to be driven by a protective variant of the gene (termed ε2 or ApoE2).
The allele frequency of these alleles varies across populations, partially explaining higher LOAD prevalence in
populations of African descent who carry the highest ApoE4 allele frequencies. In contrast to these findings,
evidence indicates ApoE4-associated LOAD risk is significantly lower in individuals of African descent
compared to other groups. This effect modification is partially driven by population-specific local ancestry that
modifies the effect size of ApoE4. This observation, however, does not fully explain the reduction in effect size
in African Americans. I hypothesize that genetic variants (local and global) modify ApoE4 and ApoE2 effect
sizes. This proposal describes three aims to address the investigation into genetic contributions to ApoE-
associated LOAD risk in multiple, diverse populations. Aim 1 will document the relationship between LOAD risk
and the ApoE4 and ApoE2 alleles in the largest and most diverse dataset to be studied to date by estimating
effect sizes in each of several diverse populations. Aim 2 will identify SNPs that associate with extreme ApoE4
and ApoE2 effect sizes and test whether these SNPs define specific physiological pathway association. Finally,
aim 3 will evaluate the relative roles of race/ethnicity and genetic variation as modifiers of effect sizes within
and between populations. As an MD/PhD candidate, I am passionate about this project as it will lead to new
insights that can be used to understand, identify, and predict LOAD risk in underserved populations in the
United States, especially those that experience increased LOAD burdens. The combined educational support
from the Population and Quantitative Health Sciences Department and clinical training from the Medical
Scientist Training Program at Case Western Reserve University will prepare me in tackling the genetic and
healthcare avenues this work aims to inform. With support from these sources, and committee members with
expertise in population genetics, statistical analysis, and bioinformatics, my training will provide the skills
necessary to become a physician scientist versed in rigorous statistical approaches to understanding
contributions to complex diseases."
10908731,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The effects of developmental alcohol exposure on astrocytes remains largely unknown, despite the extensive
and growing evidence of the roles played by these cells both in the developing and adult brain. This gap in
knowledge is due in part to the challenges of studying these cells in vivo. We propose to employ new
technologies allowing the study of astrocytes in vivo to gain mechanistic insights into astrocytic functions
altered by developmental alcohol exposure to advance the pace of our discoveries of the roles played by
astrocytes in Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). We propose to use the Aldh1l1-EGFP-Rpl10a mice
that allow for the selective pull down of actively translating RNA from astrocytes by the translating ribosome
affinity purification (TRAP) method and for the isolation of astrocyte-specific nuclei by Fluorescent-Activated
Cell Sorting (FACS). Hence, this system allows to analyze changes in both astrocyte-specific nuclear RNA
expression and astrocyte-specific RNA translation by RNA-seq. We hypothesize that neonatal alcohol
exposure induces extensive changes in the translation of genes involved in several astrocyte-mediated
processes in vivo and on molecular stuctures mainly contributed by astrocytes, such as the extracellular matrix
(ECM) that modulate some of these processes. We also hypothesize that changes in translation are in part
driven by changes in transcription and in part independent from transcription. Additionally, the proposed
studies will assess astrocyte heterogeneity in their response to developmental alcohol exposure across
developmental stages, sexes, and brain regions. The cell type-specificity of the proposed studies will help to
disentangle astrocyte function and dysfunction in FASD from contributions of other cell types. We are
particularly interested in alterations involving the ECM as we have reported that several proteins of the ECM
play important roles in neuronal development and are dysregulated by ethanol. We expect the results of our
proposed Aims to be very impactful to the FASD field. We will study the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and
hippocampus (HPC) of developing (PD7) and adult (PD90) female and male Aldh1l1-EGFP-Rpl10a mice. Aim
1: To identify changes in the astrocyte nuclear transcriptome induced by neonatal ethanol exposure by FACS
sorting of astrocyte nuclei followed by RNA-seq and pathway analysis. Aim 2: To identify changes in the
astrocyte translatome induced by neonatal ethanol exposure by TRAP-RNA-seq and integrate these findings
with transcriptome data. Aim 3: To explore the dysregulation of the astrocyte ECM network that underlies some
of the developmental effects of ethanol by TRAP-qPCR, Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH)-RNAscope,
Western blot, and immunohistochemistry to validate at both mRNA and protein levels ethanol-induced changes
in ECM proteins. The proposed studies address NIH/NIAA priorities as they will provide mechanistic insights
into astrocyte functions altered by developmental alcohol exposure in the developing and adult brain which are
likely involved in behavioral abnormalities and mental illnesses developed by adults with FASD."

 This proposal is designed to address the critical workforce need for physician and scientist investigators in
respiratory related disorders. To develop such investigators, we seek support for an educational curriculum
designed to meet the special research training needs of emerging, talented pulmonary, allergy, or critical care
medicine postdoctoral PhD trainees and MD fellows. The program will include high standards of research that
span the entire spectrum comprising fundamental discovery science, early translational research, clinical
investigations, population science research, and translational research, thereby moving fundamental
discoveries into clinical and public health practice in real-world settings. We aim to ensure success by
proposing an innovative program that contains both fundamental core elements yet adapts to the individual
needs of each trainee. Our program builds on: 1- Lessons learned from our own experience in running a
successful KL2 program with a high rate of transitioning scholars to independent academic careers at an early
stage, 2- A highly successful innovative research-oriented medical school program, 3- Strong pulmonary,
allergy, and critical care MD fellowship programs and strong PhD doctoral programs which provide a large pool
of qualified applicants, and 4- Proven strategies from published national studies on mentorship and
approaches recommended by these studies to attract and retain promising young people, especially
underrepresented minorities, in research. Our T32 Program has the following AIMS: Aim 1: To provide
postdoctoral (MD, PhD, MD/PhD) trainees who are engaged in pulmonary, allergy or critical care medicine and
research with multidisciplinary didactic training, coupled to a team mentored research experience. Aim 2: To
enhance the ability of trainees to work as part of an integrated, multidisciplinary team by developing a
knowledge base and skills in research methods, communication skills, professionalism, the ethical conduct of
research and rigorous analysis of reproducible findings. Aim 3: To recruit, retain and accelerate the
independent career development of a pool of young investigators with the multidisciplinary skills necessary for
an independent research career in basic, clinical, translational or population health research. Once they
complete our highly adaptive program, trainees will have the knowledge and skills to pursue outstanding
cutting-edge research careers and will be able to recognize the importance of different research paradigms,
ranging from molecular medicine to public health sciences, for rapidly translating scientific discoveries into
better diagnostics and therapeutics. This T32 proposal will fill an important gap in our existing research training
portfolio by providing structured research training. We anticipate that trainees supported by this program will be
engaged in experimental approaches, form mentor-trainee relationships and gain the additional research
experience needed to enhance competitiveness for independent research and career development awards."

This application for an Independent Scientist Award (K02) requests support to develop a program of
brain-based and behavioral research on substance use disorders (SUD), especially cannabis use disorder
(CUD). My laboratory is supported in part by a funded R01 (DA039135) that seeks to understand the effects of
medical marijuana on the brain, cognition, and escalation to CUD. In the next phase of my career, I propose to
learn enhanced analytical techniques (e.g. machine learning and predictive modeling) that can capitalize on
newly-available, large, longitudinal datasets that can answer fundamental questions about the development of
SUD that cannot be answered in small populations. In addition, I propose a secondary training goal of gaining
expertise in developmental neuroscience, to broaden the populations I can study to include children and
adolescents at-risk for SUD. Together, these skillsets will allow me to greatly expand the types of questions I
can ask, by allowing me to answer questions about SUD using both large observational data-sets, and also
targeted experimental manipulations (such as my R01). My goal at the end of this K02 to have the tools to not
only use big data to better understand risk factors and consequences of addiction in large samples, but also to
use this knowledge to inform future experimental studies and clinical trials that I can conduct in my lab.
 The scientific focus of this application is a research project, using the publicly-available Adolescent
Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) dataset of 11,877 children scanned longitudinally, to understand
how trajectories of change in impulsivity associate with brain-based abnormalities and SUD risk. The aims for
the ABCD analysis project are to (1) define the factorial structure of impulsivity in the ABCD dataset as it may
portend SUD risk (using a confirmatory factor model which will be applied to the array of behavioral tasks, self-
report measures, and parent reports), (2) determine structural and functional brain measures that correlate with
impulsivity, and (3) examine how longitudinal changes in brain signatures of impulsivity are associated with risk
for SUD. To accomplish these aims, I will participate in courses and train with collaborators with expertise in
developmental neuroscience and in statistical analyses of big data. The skills I learn in the K02 period will be

The long-term goal of the research proposed here is to determine the molecular mechanism of homologous
genetic recombination and DNA break repair. This objective is approached by a combination of genetic
analysis of mutants and biochemical analysis of proteins and DNA from cells. This research uses the fission
yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe as well as the bacterium Escherichia coli and its phage lambda. All are
widely studied, highly tractable model organisms with features common to all organisms, including humans.
The studies are focused on meiotic recombination in S. pombe, whose high rates of recombination facilitate
both genetic and biochemical analyses, and on the major pathway of recombination and DNA break repair in
bacteria, promoted by RecBCD enzyme, a complex DNA repair machine, whose 3D structure allows us to
determine at atomic level how recombination initiation is regulated.
 Building on past achievements, the research is currently focused on the following areas. 1) Studying
how meiotic DNA double-strand break (DSB) hotspots form clusters, and how these clusters impart DSB
interference and, consequently, crossover interference important for proper chromosome segregation. This
research promises to solve the 100-year-old problem of crossover interference, a major genetic puzzle for
which we have proposed a molecular mechanism and supported with many data. 2) Studying how RecBCD
enzyme controls its potentially rampant nuclease activity and appropriately activates it by interaction with Chi
hotspots of recombination (5’ GCTGGTGG 3’). This research promises to solve at near-atomic level the
molecular mechanism of RecBCD enzyme, the principal controller of the major pathway of E. coli
recombination, first observed 75 years ago, and a paradigm for chromosomal site control of other complex
DNA enzymes. 3) Seeking more potent RecBCD inhibitors, which are promising antibiotics against a novel
(unused) target. New antibiotics are needed to counter ever-more-frequent drug-resistant bacteria. These
goals will be attacked by a combination of genetic analysis of mutants, fluorescence microscopy of intracellular
proteins and chromosomal sites, physical analysis of DNA intermediates from meiotic cells, and enzymatic and
biophysical analyses of isolated proteins. The results of these studies will elucidate the molecular mechanism
of recombination and DNA break repair as well as the controls on recombination that ensure that it occurs at
the proper time and place along chromosomes.
 Recombination is important for faithful meiotic chromosome segregation, error-free repair of frequently
arising DNA double-strand breaks, and generation of cellular and organismal diversity. Aberrancies of
recombination can generate chromosomal rearrangements, such as translocations, duplications, and deletions,
which are often associated with or the cause of infertility, birth defects, and cancers."

It is important for an organism to develop a strong defense to repel an infection, which means
the organism must fine tune its immune system to provide efficient clearance of the pathogen.
Reponses to these different pathogens can be further divided to long lasting protection and
short-lived protection by B cells 1. In the context of B cell activation, these responses proceed in
the lymphatic system in extrafollicular space with the development of Germinal Centers (GC) 5.
The use of epigenetics allows us to understand what cellular signals contributes to cellular
differentiation after activation and what changes different pathogens create in these responses
36-39. Mouse models are an invaluable resource for studying the immune system. This study
aims to define the histone modifications in genes involved in the Memory B Cell (MBC)
transcription factor network. We want to know how MBCs differentiate and what differences are
there between GC derived and GC-independent MBCs. Some infections are cleared before
GCs are made while other infections need the advance fine tenement of B cells for the infection
to be cleared 14-16. We will study the phenotypes of MBCs and what effect H3K27 histone
modification has on MBC development and function. It has been shown for example that
challenging B cells with LPS (type-1 TI antigen) and EZH2 (the protein involved in placing
H3K27me3 marks) leads to increased antibody secreting cells 7. We know that MBCs are
epigenetically primed at genes involved in B cell activation, signal transduction, survival and
migration 28. We aim to uncover what factors support the priming necessary for B cell
differentiation in MBCs. This application seeks to test the hypothesis that GC and GC-
independent MBCs are a distinct lineage that requires specific molecular signals and
epigenetic remodeling. The Specific Aims of this project are: 1: Phenotype MBCs in an PR8
influenza response and 2: Define H3K27me3 role in the development of MBC populations. In
Aim 1, we will determine the molecular landscape of MBCs. In Aim 2, we will establish
H3K27me3 role in the formation, longevity, and reactivation of MBCs."

Stroke is one of the most common causes of death and disability in the United States and worldwide. The
vascular system is meticulously regulated throughout life to adapt to changes in metabolic demand and blood
flow under widely variable conditions. Many ischemic stroke patients however fail to fully recover following an
acute attack. This impaired recovery is related in part to the limited return of perfusion within the brain
microcirculation, even after restoring the patency of occluded vessels – a scenario referred to as the “no-reflow”
phenomenon. Blood circulating within the vascular system exerts different types of forces on the surrounding
vessels. These forces are sensed and interpreted by the vascular cells to guide their development during
embryogenesis and regulate remodeling during postnatal and adult life. It has been also suggested in recent
years that there are signals downstream of mechanical changes that are exchanged between vascular cells.
Specifically, pericytes and endothelial cells integrate these cues to dynamically regulate blood vessel physiology,
capillary permeability, and changes in microvascular tone in health and in disease. Despite recent advances in
our knowledge of flow-mediated biomechanical inputs, the underlying molecular processes and their link to
hemodynamic forces in vivo are still emerging, in part due to limitations in the tools and models to measure these
forces. To help fill this gap in knowledge, the proposed study aims to investigate the impact of abrupt changes
in blood flow on two components of the blood-brain barrier -- pericytes and endothelial cells -- and their interaction
in mature brain vessels under static conditions following the loss of flow. We will utilize both ex vivo and in vivo
models to establish the mechanistic interactions underlying how pericytes and endothelial cells process,
interpret, and organize various mechanical signals. Additionally, we will look at corresponding changes in the
surrounding extracellular matrix that might accompany this cellular interplay, specifically interactions between
endothelial cell integrin α5 and pericyte-derived vitronectin within the capillary wall. Our preliminary data suggests
a two-phase response over time following an acute shift towards static conditions. We propose that an early
stage marked by a rapid inflammatory response, involving elevated interleukin-1beta expression, is overlaid by
a hypoxia-driven response in a subsequent phase, both contributing to cerebrovascular instability and an
increased risk for hemorrhagic conversion of ischemic stroke patients after re-establishing cerebral blood flow.
Identifying the key mechanistic determinants responsible for blood vessel destabilization in the brain during the
hyper-acute phase of stroke will provide targetable signals that could be clinically significant in advancing stroke
therapies."

 Retinal degeneration leads to blindness due to loss of photoreceptors. However, a significant
number of the inner retinal neurons survive to a large extent, providing an opportunity for a
restoration of vision by electrical stimulation of these cells. We developed a photovoltaic
substitute of the photoreceptors, which directly converts light into pulsed electric current in each
pixel, stimulating the nearby second-order neurons. Clinical trial in patients blinded by atrophic
Age-related Macular Degeneration confirmed the safety, stability of such implants and spatial
resolution closely matching the 100µm pixel size. However, the current geometry of the flat
bipolar pixels does not allow significant decrease of the pixel size due to rapid increase of the
stimulation threshold with smaller pixels.
 We will develop three complimentary approaches to this challenge, which should
enable decreasing the pixel size down to 20µm and thereby enable highly functional restoration
of sight. Instead of using local return electrodes in each pixel of a bipolar design, we will use
monopolar pixels whose active electrodes can serve as both, anodes and cathodes. In this
design, the return current flows via dark pixels using integrated shunt resistors, which enables
deeper penetration of electric field into the retina. In addition, we will use optically-controlled
current steering for enhanced field confinement. It enables adjustment of the lateral and axial
confinement of electric field in tissue by spatiotemporal optical modulation of the photovoltaic
array. We will also use pillar electrodes: utilizing the migration of the inner retinal neurons into
the voids in the subretinal implant, the stimulating electrode on top of a pillar gets closer to
the target cells. This way, the stimulation threshold is decreased and selectivity of the bipolar
cells stimulation increased. All three approaches can be combined, each already
demonstrated very encouraging preliminary results, and now they will be developed to the full
extent for eventual transition into clinical testing."

The number and variety of Highly Toxic Chemicals (HTCs) that pose a health risk to the civilian population is
extensive. The Department of Homeland Security has identified close to 200 HTCs as credible public health and
safety threats. HTCs comprise diverse chemical classes and toxicity mechanisms including acids, alkylating
agents, vesicating agents, metabolic poisons, cellular respiration inhibitors, and many with understudied toxicity
and mechanisms. However only a small subset of known HTCs have been well-characterized, and there remains
an urgent unmet need to improve our understanding of the physiological mechanisms involved in the initiation
and downstream events of injury following exposure understudied HTCs.
Relevant to this proposal, we have developed micro-physiological 3D human airway Organ Tissue Equivalent
(OTE) platform for modeling pulmonary toxicity resulting from exposure to chlorine gas and for identification of
novel mechanisms of injury and for testing of potential medical countermeasures (MCMs). Our HTC exposure
system allows safe delivery of a broad range of gas, vapor or nebulized liquid HTCs to lung OTEs with high
precision and accuracy. We have established assays rapidly determining dose/toxicity relationships,
physiologically relevant chemical, biological and functional evaluation of mechanisms of toxicity and
transcriptomic analysis for the discovery of novel toxicity pathways and MCM targets. Our overall hypothesis is
that our established airway OTE - HTC delivery system and transcriptomic bioinformatic capabilities can be
applied to different classes of HTCs to characterize mechanisms of toxicity and define potential molecular targets
for MCM intervention.
If successful, this proposal promises to improve our understanding of the initiation and downstream events of
injury on acute exposure of a broad range of understudied HTCs. Rapidly defining dose/toxicity relationships
and mechanisms of action of understudied HTCs will have a major impact on understanding potential risks for
mass HTC exposure events. Finally, the potential to identify common molecular pathways of injury in response
to a range of HTC types could have a significant impact in identifying and deploying effective medical
countermeasures with broad application across unidentified or understudied HTCs. Future work will accelerate
MCM discovery, repurposing and development with broader applicability across the pulmonary threat spectrum."

Tumor suppressor gene speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP), a substrate adaptor of cullin3-RING ubiquitin ligase,
demonstrates heterozygous missense mutations in up to 15% of prostate cancers, yet the functional significance
of these SPOP mutations is largely unknown. We identified SPOP-binding consensus motifs in multiple proteins
of the canonical cGAS-STING and non-canonical STING-NF-κB pathways and demonstrated that human and
mouse STING protein is a bona fide SPOP target. Analysis of SPOP mutant (SPOPmut) and SPOP wild-type
(SPOPwt) castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) clinical data sets revealed a 29-gene “SPOPmut gene
signature”, which reflected STING-NF-κB signaling activity and suggested a role for the recruitment of tumor
microenvironment (TME)–facilitated tumor cell growth and survival in SPOPmut CRPC. Further evaluation of the
“SPOPmut gene signature” in primary, untreated prostate cancer from TCGA revealed a subset of SPOP mutant
tumors, as well as a subset of CHD1 mutant (CHD1mut) tumors, that are enriched for the signature. Importantly,
co-mutations in SPOP and CHD1 (chromatin remodeling factor) are well documented. In stably transduced
human and mouse SPOPmut (SPOPF102C and SPOPF133V)–expressing CRPC models, we demonstrated
upregulation of non-canonical STING-NF-κB-IL-6 pathway proteins, STAT3, and HMG proteins involved in
promoting secretory pathway activities. We also showed that PARP inhibitor (PARPi) treatment of SPOPmut
CRPC cells induces DNA damage, activates canonical cGAS-STING-TBK-IFN-ß signaling and suppresses non-
canonical STING-NF-κB-IL-6/STAT3, in part through inhibitory phosphorylation (S754-STAT3), leading to growth
suppression and apoptotic signaling. Olaparib (OLA) increased IFN-β secretion and reduced viability to a greater
extent in SPOPmut prostate cancer cells than in control cells in coculture with macrophages versus monoculture.
In addition, activation of cGAS-STING and induction of IFN-ß in macrophages were demonstrated only in OLA-
treated coculture models, and neutralizing antibody experiments showed that paracrine regulation of OLA-
mediated growth suppression involved IFN-β induction and IL-6 suppression of SPOPmut prostate cancer cells.
We hypothesize that SPOPmut, CHD1 deletion (CHD1del) and SPOP + CHD1 co-mutations in prostate cancers
promote PARPi or PARPi + anti-IL-6 therapeutic efficacy through enhanced synthetic lethality driven by
increased, unrepaired DNA damage, which leads to a shift in the balance toward canonical cGAS-STING-IFN-ß
signaling and suppression of IL-6/STAT3. We propose to analyze the underlying mechanisms of the SPOPmut
and CHD1del prostate cancer phenotype and define these genetically driven TME alterations and their protein
effectors through macrophage reprogramming using state-of-the-art proteomics (Aim 1); analyze the efficacy of
PARPi and anti-IL-6 treatment in SPOPmut (F133V), CHD1del, and SPOPmut;CHD1del RM-1-BM syngeneic
CRPC models (Aim 2); and analyze clinical trial tissue and blood samples from PARPi-treated SPOPmut and
CHD1mut prostate cancer patients for biomarkers of this genetically driven phenotype (Aim 3)."

Customized 3D planning of radiation therapy for lung cancer delivers a lethal dose to the tumor
region while avoiding important structures (spine) and organs (esophagus, heart, lungs) Since
radiation dose to functioning lung is associated with acute radiation pneumonitis and chronic
radiation fibrosis, researchers seek to shift dosage preferentially away from lung regions with
highest function. Several lung functional imaging modalities have been investigated (ventilation-
perfusion SPECT and PET, 4DCT, hyperpolarized 3He). These studies indicate that regional
ventilation is not the optimal biomarker. What is needed is a high-resolution imaging modality,
tolerable to patients who have difficulty holding their breath, that delineates regions of full lung
function warranting preservation, and also identifies regions whose function is irrevocably gone.
Hyperpolarized xenon-129 (HXe) MRI provides highly detailed maps of several lung functional
characteristics. Its solubility in tissues and affinity for hemoglobin allow it to be used as a tracer
for gas exchange kinetics, a so-called “regional DLCO”. Up until now, HXe imaging modalities
required long breath holds, which are not well tolerated by lung-compromised patients. We
developed an HXe assessment technique that probes several lung function characteristics,
including gas exchange to/from red blood cells, with a natural tidal-breathing protocol. Our
industrial team developed an automated xenon hyperpolarizer that delivers the required multi-liter
volumes at polarizations that approach 50%, enabling this protocol to become routine.
We propose a translational study applying HXe MRI to functional avoidance plan optimization to
minimize fibrosis in lung cancer patients. To maximize statistical significance, we stratify the
patient cohort selecting patients with significant heterogeneity: half with de novo lung cancer with
GOLD stage 3+ emphysema comorbidity and half receiving RT for their second (primary) lung
cancer. Maps will delineate three functional regions: full function with both ventilation and gas
exchange to RBCs (extra importance for avoidance), regions where function is irrevocably absent
(reduced avoidance), and other regions where function may be present or recoverable (normal
avoidance). In year 1 we conduct an open-label trial to optimize the functional imaging protocols
with upgraded hardware. With IRB and DSMB approval, our Phase 2 clinical trial will enroll 70
patients: half receiving standard-of-care treatment and half undergoing RT guided by HXe MRI.
Six-month post-treatment assessments include changes in HXe MRI, for regional correlation with
local dose. Primary endpoint will be change in DLCO, with secondary endpoints of breathing-
related quality of life change from baseline, spirometry/DLCO relative to predicted,
incidence/severity of pneumonitis, and change in HXe-MRI."

Limb loss due to amputation is a common problem, occurring in nearly 2 million people in the
US. Approximately 90% of individuals with limb amputation experience the persistent sensation
of the missing extremity, known as a phantom limb, and up to 85% experience persistent and
debilitating pain in the missing limb, termed phantom limb pain (hereafter PLP). We previously
demonstrated that Virtual Reality (VR) with active leg movements and vision of a virtual limb
significantly reduce phantom limb pain in subjects with below the knee amputations. The work
proposed here has several objectives. In Specific Aim 1 we will randomize 40 subjects with PLP to
treatment with our Active VR or a commercially available VR pain treatment (Cool!). In Specific Aim
2 we propose to develop a home intervention for PLP using the intervention (Active VR or Cool!) that
in Specific Aim 1 proved to be most efficacious. In specific Aim 3 we will obtain multimodal ultra-high
resolution (7T) MRI imaging in subjects with PLP before and after treatment, and normal subjects
without amputation; we will also attempt to develop imaging biomarkers that predict efficacy of
treatment. Imaging studies will address a number of controversies regarding the neural basis of PLP
and explore human neuroplasticity more generally. Finally, in Specific Aim 4 we propose to determine
factors that could be used in a clinical biomarker-based algorithm to predict response to home-based
VR treatment. Using classification and regression tree (CART) analysis with the data from Aim 2, we
will identify behavioral and neuroanatomic factors that predict treatment response. By the end of the
grant period, we will have determined the relative efficacy of two VR treatments for PLP, assessed the
feasibility and efficacy of a low-cost home-based treatment, determined the neuroanatomic changes
associated with treatment response using advanced methods, and explored the behavioral and
neuroimaging biomarkers predicting treatment response. These data will provide a critical step
toward clinical implementation of a VR treatment protocol for PLP and will advance theoretical
understanding of the mechanisms and functional neuroanatomy of PLP."

 Aberrant lipoprotein metabolism is a hallmark of obesity that affects >40% of Americans. Obesity and its com-
plications, including type-2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular, amyloid and severe viral diseases, are the leading
causes of premature death. The ultimate goal of this research is to help diagnose and treat these disorders. This
project addresses critical unresolved questions in the lipoprotein functionality in obesity. High-, low- and very low-
density lipoproteins (HDL, LDL and VLDL) are diverse nanoparticles comprised of lipids and apolipoproteins that
direct lipid metabolism in plasma. This process is extremely complex and many details are unknown. Our current
focus is on the interactions of lipoproteins and proteins with heparan sulfate (HS), which can trigger both cardio-
vascular and amyloid diseases. We will determine the molecular mechanisms of apolipoprotein-HS interactions
and altered lipoprotein functionality in obesity. Our powerful approach, which integrates a wide array of biochem-
ical, biophysical and computational tools, enabled us to postulate compelling new hypotheses that will be tested
in three complementary specific aims. Aim 1 will determine how lipoprotein functionality changes in obesity be-
fore and after treatment. Lipoproteins from healthy and morbidly obese subjects will be isolated based on the
heparin binding affinity, and their biochemical and functional properties will be determined. Our new hypothesis
supported by strong pilot studies will be tested: small particles formed upon action of lipoprotein lipase on circu-
lating VLDL provide novel biomarkers of obesity and readouts for treatment. Aim 2 will define the biochemical
and functional details of serum amyloid A (SAA) transfer from HDL to LDL in obesity. Our pilot studies indicate
that transfer of this small protein induces pro-atherogenic changes in LDL, and suggest two hypotheses that will
be tested: i) new mechanistic links between obesity, elevated SAA and atherosclerosis, and ii) novel beneficial
role of SAA as a lipid scavenger in obesity. Aim 3 will determine how HS and heparin affect SAA misfolding in
amyloid A (AA) amyloidosis, a life-threatening complication of obesity and chronic inflammation. SAA binding to
HS is a therapeutic target in AA amyloidosis but molecular details are lacking. Our pilot studies suggest that: i)
SAA binding to HS initiates an extracellular pathway of amyloid deposition; ii) periodic anionic arrays in HS bind
to stacks of basic residues in amyloid and stabilize amyloid nuclei. To test these intriguing new ideas, we will
combine biochemical, biophysical, hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, and computational meth-
ods with atomic structures of SAA in crystals and fibrils. Outcome: this research will identify new mechanistic
links between obesity and atherosclerosis; verify the hypothetical vital role of SAA as a lipid scavenger; clarify
its misfolding pathway in amyloid; and help develop new diagnostic tools and treatments for obesity and related
disorders. Broader impact of this research is that it will: i) help understand and modulate the causal link between
obesity, T2D and severe COVID-19 disease, and ii) uncover the molecular underpinnings of HS-amyloid inter-
actions that can critically impact not only in AA but also Alzheimer's and other major amyloid diseases."
10910047,"PROJECT SUMMARY
DNA damage cannot be prevented because elements in a normal cellular environment including water and
oxygen contribute to damage. Therefore, DNA repair pathways are essential for maintaining genomic stability
and preventing diseases associated with DNA damage-induced mutagenesis. Even with functional DNA repair
pathways, some DNA damage will inevitably escape repair and block DNA replication when encountered by the
replisome. Cells have specialized pathways to bypass or repair DNA damage that blocks replication to allow
replication to proceed. DNA helicases are among the enzymes essential for DNA repair, and these enzymes act
both during and outside of DNA replication. The Rad3/XPD family of iron-sulfur (Fe-S)-containing DNA helicases
plays an important role in DNA repair and maintaining genome stability. There are four family members in
humans, XPD, FANCJ (a.k.a. BRIP1), DDX11 (a.k.a. ChlR1), and RTEL1, that are crucially important for human
health as evidenced by diseases associated with mutations in each of the genes. Genetic disorders linked to
mutations in Rad3/XPD family helicases are typically associated with genome instability, a predisposition to
cancer, and a number of other pathologies. This proposal will define biochemical and molecular mechanisms for
a newly discovered member of the Rad3/XPD helicase family in Escherichia coli, YoaA, that plays a role in
repairing DNA damage during DNA replication. Our collaborators in the Lovett laboratory use 3’-azido-
3’deoxythymidine (AZT) as a reagent to block DNA replication in E. coli, and they identified two genes, yoaA and
holC, that work together to give cells tolerance to AZT. Protein sequence predicts, and our preliminary results
confirm, that the first gene, yoaA, encodes an Fe-S helicase. The second gene, holC, encodes the c subunit of
DNA polymerase III holoenzyme (pol III HE) implicating the E. coli replicase in repair of AZT lesions. However,
our preliminary results have uncovered a novel function for c as a subunit of the YoaA helicase, and we propose
that c functions with the YoaA helicase rather than pol III HE in a pathway that repairs AZT lesions. The main
premise of this proposal is that YoaA and c constitute a DNA helicase that is involved in the repair of
damaged 3’ ends at stalled replication forks. Our aims are to: 1) characterize the YoaA•c protein, 2)
characterize the helicase and substrate preferences for YoaA•c, and 3) define functional interactions between
YoaA and c in vitro and develop a key reagent to investigate these functional interactions in vivo. This proposal
will provide the first biochemical characterization of the YoaA•c helicase, a member of the Rad3/XPD family of
helicases which play critical roles in human health by maintaining genome stability."
10923982,"Social genomic mechanisms of health disparities among Adolescent and Young Adult (AYA) cancer
survivors.
Survivors of cancer diagnosed in adolescence or young adulthood have an elevated risk of multiple health
problems. They also experience specific and unique psychosocial stressors and life disruptions having
ramifications for their health, mental health, and quality of life (QOL). These outcomes, and disparities in these
outcomes (by race/ethnicity, sex and gender, geographic location), may be partially a function of social
determinants of health, including socioeconomic gradients, exposures to early childhood traumas or adversity,
and accumulated experiences of discrimination. Yet, little is known about these effects including the biological
pathways through which the known effects of social-environmental risk factors on population health and well-
being influence outcomes in post-treatment AYA cancer survivors, particularly with regard to morbidity, mortality,
and QOL. Therefore, the research proposed here is intended to identify and define functional genomic pathways
through which current and past psychosocial and social environmental risk and resilience factors influence gene
regulation in AYAs, and thus contribute to a greater understanding of health disparities in post-treatment
survivorship. We propose a 5-year longitudinal prospective cohort study of 2000 AYA cancer survivors recruited
within one year following completion of treatment for Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Using repeated
measures of risk and resilience factors and blood assays, we will evaluate the extent to which biological,
psychological and social indicators are associated with, and potentially predict, mortality and morbidity in AYA
cancer survivors within two years following completion of therapy. In collaboration with the Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group-American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ECOG-ACRIN) research infrastructure and
the National Cancer Institute Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP), this study will 1) identify the
genome-wide transcriptional impact of social-environmental RISK factors (i.e., adverse living conditions/poverty,
childhood trauma exposure, social isolation, and discrimination) and define the relationships of those genomic
profiles to AYA survivor mortality, morbidity, and QOL; 2) identify the genome-wide transcriptional impact of
individual RESILIENCE factors (i.e., social support, sense of purpose/meaning-making, self-efficacy) and define
the relationships of those genomic profiles to AYA mortality, morbidity, and QOL; and, 3) identify the genome-
wide molecular correlates of vulnerable populations, as structured by race/ethnicity, sexual/gender identity, and
geography (e.g., rural vs. urban), and define the relationships of those genomic profiles to AYA survivor mortality,
morbidity, and QOL. The study results may inform the conceptualization and development of new biological /
molecular targets for future interventions to reduce risks for long-term and late effects of treatment and maximize
likelihood of long-term health and QOL for AYA cancer survivors."

Aging is the greatest risk factor for cancer development, yet the physiological and molecular mechanisms
underlying this relationship remain poorly understood. Undoubtedly, one contributing factor is time – i.e. the
years or decades needed for a single cell to acquire sufficient mutations to trigger overt disease. However,
other factors certainly play a role, including age-related changes in cell metabolism, DNA damage responses,
immune cell function, and the abundance of senescent cells. While understanding how these factors influence
tumorigenesis will reveal strategies to improve cancer intervention and treatment, facile models to study cancer
in aged animals are lacking. Addressing this critical challenge, we incorporate somatic tissue engineering
methods to introduce oncogenic mutations directly into the organs of aged mice, thereby obviating the time and
costs of intercrossing and aging cohorts of multi-allelic genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs). We
have developed a range of such “non-germline GEMMs” (nGEMMs) of different target organs and cancer
genotypes and shown that the resulting cancers recapitulate molecular and histological features of the
corresponding human disease. We have also produced nGEMMs using aged mice and shown that the
developing tumors have distinct immune infiltrates with different tumor surveillance capabilities. This proposal
combines the unique capabilities of nGEMMs with state-of-the-art tissue analyses to assess the contribution of
the aged environment to cancer manifestation in different organ contexts and compares results to settings in
which dietary or genetic factors uncouple biological age from chronological age. Implementation of advanced
single cell methods will produce a detailed picture of cell type and cell state differences in tumors developing in
aged animals and perturbation studies will explore tumor cell intrinsic and extrinsic factors underlying age-
related phenotypes. The proposed experiments will benefit from combining our expertise in cancer biology with
that of Dr. Laura Niedernhofer, who has extensive experience in studying organismal aging. Our studies will
establish broadly portable models for studying cancer in aged mice at a breadth and pace that was previously
impossible and produce novel insights into how the epigenetic and physiological processes linked to age
contribute to an increase in cancer incidence and/or progression."

Calorie restriction (CR) is a promising nutritional strategy with the potential to slow the aging process. The
Comprehensive Assessment of Long-term Effects of Reducing Intake of Energy (CALERIE) trial, funded by the
National Institute on Aging, was the first clinical trial to demonstrate the feasibility of achieving sustained,
moderate CR in healthy, young and middle-aged adults without obesity. During the 2-year CR intervention,
participants achieved 12% CR on average and, compared to an ad libitum intake control group, experienced
remarkable improvements in markers of healthspan and a slower rate of biological aging. The overarching goal
of this proposed study is to examine whether 2 years of CR results in long-term improvements in the biological,
phenotypic, and functional hallmarks of human aging. We hypothesize that exposure to a 2-year CR
intervention in early to mid-adulthood results in sustained lower rates of biological aging, delayed
manifestations of phenotypic aging, superior indices of functional aging, and greater quality of life compared to
ad libitum intake. To test this hypothesis, we will conduct an observational follow-up study of CALERIE
participants 10 to 15 years after the end of their trial participation. Participants from the CALERIE CR group will
be compared with an ad libitum intake comparison group composed of the CALERIE ad libitum control group
and a matched community-dwelling cohort from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA). The well-
characterized BLSA cohort is included as a comparison sample to address the concern that the highly
screened CALERIE controls may have been healthier than the general population and highly motivated for
behavior change. The BLSA also has the rigor, quality control, and several of the same outcome
measurements as the CALERIE trial to facilitate comparisons. The proposed CALERIE follow-up study will
include a comprehensive set of physical and functional assessments, including resting metabolic rate, body
composition, cardiorespiratory fitness, grip strength, and cognitive function, in addition to psychological and
quality-of-life measures. Blood and urine also will be collected and analyzed for markers of biological aging and
cardiometabolic disease risk. Comparisons will be made between CALERIE CR participants and the combined
ad libitum intake comparison group (the CALERIE ad libitum control group and the BLSA cohort). Evaluating
legacy effects of the CALERIE trial will determine the effectiveness of a CR intervention in early to mid-
adulthood for preventing the development or delaying the progression of age-related chronic disease. The
proposed trial will augment the CALERIE data and biospecimen repository for future research to advance our
understanding of human aging."
10918073,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Metastasis is responsible for 90% of cancer deaths, yet there is a severe lack of effective anti-metastatic targeted
therapeutics. Collective invasion, where heterogeneous packs of cells travel together, is a major mode of
metastasis observed in patients across many solid tumor types. The underlying biological mechanisms for how
the collective invasion pack communicates to emerge, navigate, and persist as a single cohesive unit remain
unclear. Using our patented SaGA technique (Spatiotemporal Genomic and Cellular Analysis), which leverages
a combination of live-cell confocal microscopy and fluorescence-activated cell sorting, we found that cooperation
between leader and follower subpopulations is crucial for successful collective invasion, with leaders promoting
the invasion of followers, and followers promoting the survival and proliferation of leaders. The proposed work
deconstructing how the collective invasion pack facilitates metastasis will be performed by Dr. Janna Mouw in
the laboratory of Dr. Adam Marcus, the Unit Director, at the Winship Cancer Institute at Emory University. The
overall objective of the proposed work is to dissect the molecular underpinnings of subpopulation cooperation in
promoting collective invasion and metastasis as outlined in Dr. Marcus's funded R01 grants, R01CA236369 and
R01CA250422. As such, the goals of Dr. Mouw's project are to: 1) define how heterogeneous lung cancer
subpopulation cooperation and spatial coordination through Jag1 drive collective cancer cell invasion and tumor
metastasis, and 2) establish whether atypical angiogenic mimicry and leader cell-driven Jag1 signaling
destabilize the tumor endothelium to promote lung cancer transendothelial migration and metastasis. Dr. Mouw
has more than 15 years of experience in cancer research at top-tier institutions. She has a multidisciplinary
background in cancer biology, bioengineering, and mechanical engineering, bringing a unique expertise and
perspective to her research on the roles for subpopulation communication and collective invasion in cancer
progression and metastasis. Through these experiences, Dr. Mouw has extensive training using a vast variety
of in vitro and in vivo approaches to comprehensively test her hypotheses. Dr. Mouw has made significant
contributions to Dr. Marcus's research program, and has published multiple first-author articles in well-regarded
journals, such as Nature Medicine and Nature Cell Biology. Overall, Dr. Mouw has the expertise and dedication
to lead these studies, which will define the metastatic potential and translational impact of the rare, yet invasive
leader population in lung cancer patients. Taken together, the work proposed here will be of impactful benefit to
the research program, and provide critical mechanistic insight into the atypical angiogenic mimicry program and
translational value towards targeting lung cancer patient leader cell biology."
10893629,"ABSTRACT
Smoking is the leading threat to health of patients living with HIV (PLWH). Unfortunately, the evidence-base for
tobacco use disorder treatment in PLWH lags behind that of HIV itself. A 2016 Cochrane meta-analysis of data from
12 clinical trials involving 2,087 participants receiving both medications and behavioral support found modest
evidence of improved abstinence in the short term (<6 months), but not long-term. A short-coming of these studies is
that treatment algorithms did not include plans for non-response, or relapse to smoking. A newer clinical trial design,
the Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART), includes a dynamic treatment strategy in which pre-
specified decision rules guide the ongoing treatment of both responders and non-responders. This approach allows
SMART designs to better mirror the management of chronic relapsing conditions, such as tobacco use disorder. We,
therefore, propose a two-arm, two-stage randomized trial of 622 adult PLWH who smoke cigarettes and receive care
in one of three health systems. At inception, participants will be randomized to either combination nicotine
replacement therapy (NRT) (patch and gum or lozenge) or combination NRT+contingency management (CM). At 12
weeks, responders (non-smoking participants confirmed by exhaled carbon monoxide [eCO]) in both arms will
receive 12 more weeks of the same treatment. Non-responders (participants with continued smoking by self-report
and/or eCO) in both the NRT and NRT+CM arms will be re-randomized to 12 weeks of treatment, either with
varenicline (VAR) or varenicline+CM (VAR+CM). The intervention will be delivered by trained clinical pharmacists.
The primary outcome will be eCO-confirmed abstinence at 24 weeks post-enrollment. The specific aims of the
proposed study are to: (1) study the effectiveness of a dynamic treatment approach to reduce the prevalence of
smoking in a cohort of PLWH, and to identify the optimal approach; (2), study the effectiveness of various dynamic
regimens on CD4 count, HIV viral suppression, and VACS index (validated measure of morbidity and mortality risk);
and (3) grounded in implementation science and using a Hybrid Effectiveness-Implementation Type I design, identify
barriers and facilitators to delivering our intervention to inform future implementation. The study team includes
individuals with expertise in tobacco use disorder treatment, HIV and addiction in PLWH, clinical trials, CM,
implementation science, and SMART designs. Study components are readily scalable and all interventions are richly
evidence-based. This proposal offers innovation as the first use of the following in a smoking intervention targeting
PLWH: (1) a SMART design with first-line tobacco treatment medications; (2) clinical pharmacists as key
interventionists; (3) VACS Index 2.0 as an outcome among a general sample of PLWH who smoke; and (4)
implementation-focused process evaluation of tobacco intervention including pharmacists and CM in HIV clinics. This
study holds exceptional promise to transform tobacco use disorder treatment in HIV treatment settings nationally."
10906225,"SPRINT, and its accompanying cognitive-focused substudy SPRINT-MIND recently showed that blood pressure control (goal SBP<120 mm Hg) reduced incident mild cognitive impairment as well as a combined outcome of MCI and dementia. Divergence in opinion among experts and professional societies about BP goals still remain due to the concerns of potential harms. There is a clear need to implement new practical approaches to control blood pressure in clinical practice and test their effectiveness. Pragmatic clinical trials embedded in health systems (ePCTs) offer a unique opportunity to study the effectiveness of implementation of evidence- based interventions in real-world clinical settings. Our team is currently conducting ICD-Pieces (NCT02587936), the largest ePCT in patients with the coexistent chronic conditions of chronic kidney disease, hypertension and diabetes as part of a demonstration project in the NIH Health Care Systems Research Collaboratory. We now propose the Preventing Cognitive Decline by Reducing BP Target Trial (PCOT), to examine the effects of lowering BP to less than 130/80 upon the incidence of cognitive decline. Our main hypothesis is that patients who receive care with a collaboratory model that combines clinical decision support applied to home BPs and team-based care delivered in primary care practices will have better blood pressure control and a lower incidence of mild cognitive impairment and dementia than patients receiving usual medical care.
In this ePCT (1) Will compare the effects of intensive BP control between the intervention and usual care arm on the rate of cognitive decline measuring the change in TICS-m per year. We will recruit 4,000 patients over 70 years of age with BP >130/80 mmHg from 2 diverse health systems and randomize patients within each health system to usual care or to a combination of care with clinical decision support using home BPs and practice facilitators and Pharm Ds to lower home BP to < 130/80 mmHg. The primary outcome will be development cognitive decline as determined by a decrease in TICS-m scores from baseline; (2) Determine the potential harms of intensive lowering BP home BP below 130/80 mmHg with usual care on hospitalizations, emergency department visits, cardiovascular events, deaths, syncope, falls, fractures, hypotension, electrolyte abnormalities and acute kidney injury and; (3) Determine the impact of intensive BP management on QOL with scores obtained using the PROMIS Scale v1.2 - Global Health instrument annually
This trial is pragmatic, with broad inclusion criteria and evidence-based interventions informed by patients and delivered in primary care settings by the clinical teams in health systems serving ethnically and socioeconomically diverse population. Lessons from this trial should provide valuable insights to guide clinical practices in BP control and cognitive assessments in real-world settings as well as design and implementation of future pragmatic trials.

The neurotransmitter GABA and the redox compound glutathione can be measured in the human brain non-
invasively using Hadamard-encoded edited MRS. Such measurements currently suffer from three major
limitations: the confound of transverse relaxation (since edited MRS requires long echo times); incomplete
spectral resolution between metabolites and the macromolecular background; and inadequate/inflexible
modeling and quantification software. The overall goal of this R01 renewal period is to develop Hadamard-
encoded edited MRS of GABA and Glutathione into a robust and reproducible tool for neuroscience.
Building on the successful development of HERMES in the first funded period we will develop interleaved
multi-spectrum acquisitions to improve robustness to changes in transverse relaxation and the macromolecule
baseline and develop multi-spectrum linear combination methods within our software Osprey, including
building a demographic model of the macromolecular background spectrum. This project will culminate in a
patient-based validation study in subjects with Alzheimer’s Disease. The resulting data acquisition and analysis
tools will be made available for dissemination to the clinical neuroscience and neuroimaging communities."
10911298,"This application uses a large human prospective cohort to identify the host genetic determinants of
susceptibility to Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB), a common and potentially lethal infection. The
overarching hypothesis to be tested in this study is that specific variants in the Human Leukocyte Antigen
(HLA) class II region are important determinants of susceptibility to SAB in humans, and that these
determinants can be identified by studying large, well-characterized cohorts of patients. This hypothesis is
based upon our two separate studies that 1) identified genome-wide significant associations of variants in HLA
class II with an increased risk for S. aureus infections in individuals of European descent; and 2) identified a
genome-wide association of European-derived HLA Class II variants and SAB in African-American patients. In
the proposed study, we will further refine the genetic risk factors for SAB in the HLA class II region. We created
the S. aureus Bacteremia Group (SABG), one of the world’s largest collections of paired human DNA and
bloodstream bacteria from patients with SAB. We assembled an experienced multidisciplinary team to link the
unique SABG cohort resources to state-of-the-art genotyping technology and innovative in vivo model systems,
pushing the boundaries of the field. We propose three Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will identify the genetic risk
factors in HLA class II for developing SAB, using high-density genotyping and imputation to saturate the HLA
region in 2300 individuals with SAB and 2300 unaffected controls enrolled in the longitudinal, prospective
SABG cohort. In Aim 2, we will examine the association of HLA class II alleles and haplotypes with
complicated SAB in the 2300 patients with SAB genotyped in SA1, and consider the impact of bacterial
genotype on the risk for complicated SAB by genotyping the bloodstream S. aureus isolates from all of the
2300 SAB patients. In this way, we will test whether the association of complicated SAB with HLA class II
alleles and haplotypes is modified by the specific genetic lineage of the bloodstream S. aureus. In Aim 3, we
will evaluate the functional consequences of the HLA alleles identified in Aim 1, Aim 2, and in our previous
studies with in vivo and in vitro experiments. We will evaluate whether specific HLA class II alleles significantly
alter host T cell responses to S. aureus using 1) a S. aureus sepsis model in transgenic mice expressing
human HLA class II alleles; and 2) stimulation of T cells from SAB patients using S. aureus infected antigen
presenting cells expressing different HLA alleles. The long-term objectives of this project are 1) to fully
characterize HLA variation in a multi-ethnic sample of individuals with SAB and unaffected controls; and 2) to
provide biological evidence for the clinical relevance of the HLA class II variants identified in this project. Taken
together, the impact of this proposal is to increase our understanding of how host genetic variation influences
the initiation and severity of S. aureus infections. Elucidating the genetic basis of susceptibility to S. aureus
infection will improve our understanding, treatment, and prevention of this urgent unmet medical crisis."

 Ten percent of Americans suffer from diabetes, and in the next twenty years this number is projected to
rise alongside disease related medical and societal costs. With the rise in prevalence of diabetes, early and
precise diagnosis of diabetes subtypes are crucial for correct treatment and management of the disease.
Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY) is a rare familial monogenic form of diabetes that is caused by
mutations in genes that are involved in the development and function of the pancreatic beta cell, and is often
misdiagnosed as other diabetes subtypes. Mutations in the MODY genes not only cause MODY; mutations
with less severe functional impairment have been shown to associate with type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk. Rare
mutations have been difficult to study in a population-based setting because of how infrequently they present in
the population. Historically, MODY has been studied in small family-based settings, likely biasing penetrance
estimates and missing the complete phenotypic picture of the disease. The majority of MODY gene research
has been done in European ancestry individuals, making it more difficult for non-European ancestry groups to
access genetically-informed medicine. With the availability of large-scale and diverse biobanks, such as the
Mount Sinai BioMe biobank and the UK Biobank (UKBB), it is now possible to study MODY gene mutations in
a multi-ancestry population setting and assess their impact on MODY, T2D and related traits.
 To address the current knowledge gaps, we propose the following aims: Aim 1- To assess and
interrogate known and novel MODY-causing mutations in individuals of diverse ancestry of the BioMe
Biobank and UKBB. We will do this by examining the penetrance and expressivity of diabetes in
MODY-causing mutations, broadening the clinical spectrum of MODY-causing mutations by applying
phenome-wide association studies and identifying previously unknown MODY-causing mutations. We
hypothesize that estimates of penetrance of known MODY-causing mutations will be more accurate than family
based findings, the clinical spectrum of phenotypic associations for known MODY-causing mutations will be
broadened, and we will discover novel MODY-causing mutations. We further aim to use the population-based
biobanks to study the interplay between rare and common genetic variation and the association to T2D and
related traits. We propose: Aim 2- To examine how individuals’ risk of T2D is influenced by polygenic risk
of T2D and mutations in MODY genes in BioMe and the UKBB. We will examine the impact of rare
functionally damaging MODY gene mutations on T2D among individuals with low and high polygenic risk of
T2D and glycemic traits. We hypothesize that carrying a damaging mutation will exacerbate the risk of T2D
conferred by a polygenic burden. These steps toward understanding the impact of rare MODY gene mutations
will facilitate our long-term objective to better understand the genetics of diabetes, and implement precision
prevention, diagnostics and therapeutics to diabetes medicine."

10865083,"Project Summary
 For many species, access to resources requires a highly flexible system of social behavior that is
sensitive to environmental demands. Indeed, inflexible social behavior can be highly maladaptive, particularly
during developmental transitions when social demands are in constant flux. Yet, the neural substrates supporting
flexible social behavior during development have been underexplored. Due to technical limitations, it has been
challenging to identify the circuits responsible for social cue processing in the infant brain and how these go awry
in atypical development. Using recent advances in infant rodent neural circuit dissection, this proposal aims to
address this gap in our understanding. We focus on the lateral habenula (LHb) and its connections with the
medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) because this circuit is critical for behavioral flexibility in adults. We propose a
central hypothesis that functional inclusion of the LHb in the social behavior circuit transitions a system favoring
social approach within the nest to one favoring a balance of approach and avoidance as infants gain
independence and enter the complex social world. This transition is postulated to occur via enhanced modulation
by the mPFC at weaning age. The goal of this proposal is to test this hypothesis using advanced circuit dissection
tools in the pre-weaning (PN14) and post-weaning (PN23) rat pup across three Aims. First, we will ask how LHb
engagement controls transitions in social behavior during typical development. To address this question, we will
use complementary ex vivo (metabolic imaging, Aim 1a) and in vivo approaches (fiber photometry, Aim 1b) to
measure LHb function during social behavior in PN14 and PN23 animals. Then we will assess causation by
optogenetically controlling LHb activity during social behavior at these two ages (Aim 1c). As the LHb is
distinctive for its role as a relay center between the forebrain and monoaminergic centers in guiding behavior,
Aim 2 is designed to assess how LHb circuits control developmental transitions in social behavior. In this Aim,
we will assess network-level changes of 2-DG uptake during social behavior in extended LHb circuits as a
function of development (PN14 versus PN23) (Aim 2a). Next, we will measure (photometry) and manipulate
(optogenetics) identified projections at both ages to determine their role in developmental transitions in social
approach (Aims 2b-c). Finally, we will use a multiplexed chemogenetic approach to simultaneously control LHb
network populations to determine their respective roles in behavioral transitions (Aim 2d). The goal of Aim 3 is
to leverage the advanced circuit mapping techniques described in Aims 1 & 2 to test the hypothesis that
caregiving adversity accelerates LHb inclusion in social behavior networks to prematurely inhibit social approach.
By perturbing this system while it is still being built, the proposed experiments will identify how early experience
sculpts developing LHb circuit architecture to generate maladaptive social behavior. Together, these studies will
provide a technical and conceptual advance in our understanding of the developing social brain and the impact
of perturbing this delicate system."
10703986,"Abstract. While new, higher-valency pneumococcal conjugate vaccines( PCVs), PCV15 and PCV20,
will include important serotypes, their impact and cost-effectiveness will likely be less than what was
achieved with introduction of PCV7, PCV10 and PCV13 because, in recent years, prevalent serotypes
causing infections have changed and continue to change. Here we propose a clinical study,
vaccinating children with a low cost-to-produce, serotype-independent, killed, non-capsulated avirulent
whole-cell Streptococcus pneumoniae (wSp) vaccine that elicits Th17 cell-mediated immunity and
antibodies against all pneumococcal serotyypes, and which has been tested in adults and toddlers.
Nasopharyngeal (NP) colonization is a prerequisite to pneumococcal diseases and transmission. We
will evaluate the efficacy of wSp vaccination in young children on pneumococcal NP colonization at
times of health and onset of acute otitis media. Notably, prevention of pneumococcal NP colonization
may be a surrogate for prevention by wSp of pneumococcal infections. In addition, we will confirm the
safety and immunogenicity of wSp. Demonstration of a reduction of NP colonization, safety,
immunogenicity of wSp would engage the scientific and public health community and
commercialization support for additional licensure studies to next test for protection against various
pneumococcal diseases, to determine whether wSp could complement PCVs or even replace PCVs
as an inexpensive, serotype-independent vaccine."
10933414,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
An overarching goal of cancer screening is to detect cancer at an early stage while it is localized, treatable, and
curable. However, cancer screening is associated with false positives, high rates of indeterminate findings,
overdiagnosis, and overtreatment, which are serious limitations that need to be addressed to improve early
detection efforts. Because medical imaging is a key component of early detection for many cancers, quantitative
imaging/radiomics can provide biomarkers to address many of these limitations with early detection. Our group,
Quantitative Imaging Clinical Validation Center at Moffitt Cancer Center (QICVC-MCC), helped pioneer image
biomarker approaches leveraged in the prior funding cycle to create the first and only EDRN Clinical Validation
Center (CVC) dedicated to the validation of image biomarkers. For breast cancer, we validated several breast
density-type risk markers and diagnostic models in women classified as BI-RADS 4, noting the three
subcategories within this classification were strong diagnostic markers, and constructed a bio-image repository
for this subgroup. For lung cancer, we conducted extensive studies applying conventional radiomics for risk
prediction, discrimination between malignant and benign nodules, distinguishing between indolent and
aggressive lung cancers, predicting tumor mutations, and predicting treatment response. In this renewal, we will
expand our CVC from validated conventional feature-based radiomics as a benchmark to compare end-to-end
deep learning (DL) methods, expand to other populations, and implement AI platforms for analyzing breast, lung,
and other organ site images. In breast imaging (Aim 1), we will expand our efforts from parametric modeling to
machine learning/DL for improved risk, early detection, and diagnostic predictions and continue our data
repository developments. In lung imaging (Aim 2), we will expand our efforts from lung cancer screening to
incidentally detected nodules and surgically resected early-stage lung cancer. Additionally, in Aim 3 we will seek
out additional opportunities within the EDRN to conduct studies of image biomarkers in other organ sites beyond
breast and lung (e.g., prostate, pancreas, and cutaneous) to address emerging Network objectives. The EDRN
has proven that it is greater than the sum of the individual projects. As such, in Aim 4 we propose to build a
repository for the housing and sharing of images, algorithms, radiomics, clinical data, and information on
biospecimens. In this CVC renewal, we will systematically validate radiomic features and novel image metrics
in the early detection of cancer. This research is significant because such information may be able to complement
existing clinical guidelines and lead to new strategies to apply noninvasive image biomarkers. The research of
the QICVC-MCC is performed at an NCI-Designated Comprehensive Cancer Center, which is an outstanding
environment to conduct such studies given the access to large patient populations and outstanding resources,
and the clinical setting to deploy such biomarkers for improved personalized cancer care."
10914057,"SUMMARY
Breastfeeding has multiple beneficial effects on maternal and neonatal health; however, the statistics indicate
that up to 96% of lactating women in the US take one or more medications while breastfeeding. Medications
consumed by lactating women may be transferred into breast milk to a significant extent, resulting in
unintentional infant exposure of medications and in some cases adverse health outcomes for the infants.
Quantifying drug transfer into human breast milk is important for rational risk assessment balancing the toxicity
risk of drug exposure to infants and the benefits of breastfeeding. However, clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) studies
in the population of lactating women are challenging and logistically not possible for every drug taken by
lactating women, necessitating the use of prediction methods to address this issue. One historical approach is
the prediction of drug concentrations (or drug AUC) in breast milk based on maternal plasma concentration (or
AUC) and the milk-to-plasma (M/P) concentration or AUC ratio. The M/P ratio itself can be predicted using both
physicochemical characteristics of drugs and physiological parameters of breast milk. While this approach may
predict the M/P ratios of drugs that enter the milk predominantly by passive diffusion, no methods are currently
available to accurately predict milk secretion of drugs via transport mechanisms. Nonetheless, milk secretions of
many drugs, xenobiotics and endogenous substances are known to be mediated by transporters expressed in
mammary epithelial cells (MECs). In this application, we propose a systems pharmacology approach to predict
transporter-mediated milk secretion of drugs. Our hypothesis is that the transporter-mediated drug PK in
human breast milk can be predicted using in vitro experimental data combined with Physiologically Based
Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling and simulation (M&S). Specifically, we propose an innovative approach
which utilizes human MECs and transporter-transfected cells or plasma membrane vesicles expressing
individual transporters of interest (i.e. OCT1, BCRP). Using quantitative targeted proteomics, the human
MECs will allow us to determine the protein abundance of these transporters in the mammary gland. The
transporter-transfected cell or plasma membrane vesicle studies will allow us to determine the in vitro intrinsic
transport clearance of a drug by a single transporter. Then, the in vitro intrinsic transporter-mediated clearances
will be extrapolated to in vivo in the mammary gland for PBPK M&S. PBPK model predictions will be verified
using the drug PK data in human breast milk obtained from a clinical study conducted with a transporter
substrate. Combined, these data will allow us to predict transporter-mediated drug PK in the milk of lactating
women. These studies will address a critical gap in our understanding of drug PK in human breast milk
during lactation. Since our approach can be applied to other drugs that are substrates of any transporters of
interest, its significance goes well beyond the drug and transporters investigated here."
10812468,"PROJECTIVE SUMMARY
Alzheimer’s disease (AD), characterized by abnormal accumulation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary
tangles within the brain, is the most common form of dementia for adults aged 65 and up and the 7th leading
cause of death worldwide. Despite initial diagnoses of AD occurring over a century ago, effective clinical
therapies to prevent or treat disease progression are currently lacking. The locus coeruleus (LC), an important
brainstem nuclei which acts as the primary source of norepinephrine (NE) throughout the brain, has been
identified as one of the earliest structures to deteriorate in AD. LC degeneration is strongly correlated with
severity of cognitive decline, suggesting strategies to preserve or enhance LC function offer significant
therapeutic potential. Furthermore, NE potentiates established anti-inflammatory properties and is known to
induce microglia phagocytosis and clearance of amyloid in AD. Therefore, promoting NE release via LC
stimulation is an emerging strategy to alleviate neuropathology and cognitive deficits in AD. However, the
molecular and cellular processes which govern the potential therapeutic effects of the LC-NE system during AD
progression remain unknown. This K00 research strategy proposes a multi-modal approach involving gene
editing, intravital imaging, electrophysiology, behavioral training, and single cell sequencing to reveal the
functional role of cell-type and sub-type specific noradrenergic receptors during LC stimulation in AD. In Aim 1,
a baseline will be established determining the extent in which long-term LC stimulation reduces
neuroinflammation, amyloid/tau burden, and cognitive impairment in two different rodent models of AD. In Aim 2
and 3, gene editing will be used to interfere with sub-type specific noradrenergic receptors in astrocytes and
microglia, respectively, to understand both cell-type and sub-type specific contributions of noradrenergic
receptors on therapeutic outcomes in neuropathology and cognitive performance following long-term LC
stimulation in AD. Neuroinflammatory profiles within individual cell populations will be assessed using single cell
RNA sequencing while morphological and functional changes will be tracked longitudinally using two-photon
microscopy. Alterations in disease neuropathology following long-term LC stimulation will be compared to
changes in neuronal electrophysiology and cognitive performance over time. Ultimately, the outcomes of this
proposal will overcome significant knowledge barriers surrounding how LC stimulation rescues AD symptoms
and highlight novel biological targets to enhance therapeutic efficacy of neuromodulatory drugs and devices for
disease therapy."

The primary roles of the Implementation Core are to: 1) harmonize core functions and processes; 2) optimize
and integrate clinical decision support; and 3) enable training and intervention fidelity across the three
interventions. The Implementation Core Lead, Grudzen (mPI), and the Core Director will oversee
harmonization, adaptation, and fidelity monitoring with input from the project leads (Chodosh, Brody, Shah), an
implementation scientist (Mittman), qualitative methodologists (Dickson and Arbaje). They will oversee
optimization of clinical decision support in collaboration with a lead informatician (Mann). These seasoned
collaborators are supported by a rich research infrastructure and personnel with expertise in the
implementation of complex health interventions across multiple settings in older adults with serious illness.
NYU Grossman School of Medicine, NYU Rory Meyers College of Nursing, University of Wisconsin-Madison,
Memorial Sloan Kettering, and the mPI team have substantial expertise in harmonizing core functions of
complex interventions, enabling high fidelity across multi-site pragmatic trials in diverse settings, and tailoring
usable clinical decision support tools across variable electronic health record (EHR) platforms. To ensure
tailoring to local contextual factors across settings, the Implementation Core Steering Committee will engage
the Lived Experience Panel and Lived Practice Panel to pre-specify allowable adaptations in form, including
the mode of delivery, providers involved, materials or tools needed, dose, and frequency/intensity. Besides
overseeing all aspects of the core, the Implementation Core Lead Grudzen and the Core Director will lead
strategy to monitor and continually improve implementation. They will first conduct a needs assessment and
assess readiness at each site to develop a tailored implementation blueprint. This will include detailed standard
operating procedures that describe implementation strategies and how planned and unplanned adaptations will
be managed, measured/documented, and reported over time. They will, in coordination with the Administrative
Core, oversee the fidelity of each intervention to ensure all core functions are performed during the triadic
encounters. Approaches to achieve high fidelity will include pilot testing at multiple sites; identifying nurse,
physician, and social work champions at each ED; establishing peer-to-peer learning networks; and using
evaluative and iterative tools until fidelity targets are met. Cyclical small tests of change during pilot testing will
identify optimal implementation strategies. The lead informatician will direct the processes used to optimize the
clinical decision support and ensure that documentation and communication between internal and external
members of the care team are both compliant and seamless. A data manager will work with sites to establish
their EHR builds and extraction methods. An informatics analyst will ensure data extractions function properly,
present data for real-time fidelity monitoring, and package and send data to the Statistical Analysis Core for
analyses that may further serve real-time and later outcome analyses."
10930036,"Impaired wound healing in U.S. veterans with diabetes mellitus is a major source of morbidity and mortality as
well as a large financial strain on the VA health care system. Current treatment paradigms, including
debridement of necrotic tissue, infection control, local ulcer care, mechanical off-loading, and management of
blood glucose levels, are modestly effective at best. Despite much research in this area, the critical molecular
mechanisms regulating angiogenesis-directed wound healing remain minimally defined. Recently, our group
identified an important role for inflammatory macrophage VEGF-A production in consequent angiogenesis/
arteriogenesis required for adequate wound healing. Preliminary data support that VEGF-A expression is
increased in “classic inflammatory” macrophages relative to “alternatively activated” or wound healing
macrophages. Our preliminary data also identified that macrophage proangiogenic VEGF-A isoform expression
is dependent on expression of the potent inflammatory cytokine, IL-1β. Animals with macrophage deletion of
IL-1β demonstrated severely impaired macrophage VEGF-A expression and consequent decreases in
angiogenesis and arteriogenesis. We have begun to define a mechanistic pathway, whereby autocrine IL-1β-
IL-1R signaling promotes transcription of proangiogenic VEGF-A, in part, through activation of NF-kB and
STAT3 downstream of the IL-1R. We seek to understand the impact of diabetes on this macrophage
proangiogenic mechanism. Mice with experimental diabetes have profound delays in wound healing in a full
thickness dermal punch biopsy model and perfusion recovery in a hind limb ischemia model of femoral artery
ligation. Isolated macrophages from these diabetic mice demonstrated reduced inflammatory response to IL-1β
via reduced expression of IL-1R signaling complex components along with consequent reductions in VEGF-A
expression, consistent with the macrophage IL-1β-deletion model. The primary hypothesis is that diabetes
mellitus results in reduced macrophage IL-1β-dependent VEGF-A expression with consequent impairment in
angiogenesis-dependent wound healing, consistent with the macrophage IL-1β-deletion model. We seek to 1)
demonstrate disrupted macrophage IL-1β signaling-dependent proangiogenic VEGF-A isoform expression to
be a major mechanism of impaired angiogenesis and wound healing in DM; and 2) validate defective
monocyte/macrophage IL-1R signaling-dependent VEGF-A expression from patients with DM who develop
chronic lower extremity ulcers despite usual standard of care. By defining inflammatory macrophages as key,
early drivers of angiogenesis required for adequate wound healing, our proposed studies support a paradigm
shift away from an anti-inflammatory macrophage strategy being required to activate wound healing, allowing
for macrophage reprograming strategies that promote appropriate activation of inflammatory macrophages
toward consequent angiogenesis-dependent wound healing."

Acute Lung Injury (ALI) leads to the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), which is deadly to children
and adults. In ALI, lung microvascular hyperpermeability causes pulmonary edema, leading to oxygenation
failure characteristic of ARDS. Currently, there is no specific therapy for ARDS and treatment is supportive.
Thus, there is a need for more understanding of ALI mechanisms in order to develop potential therapeutics.
Dr. Rebecca Hough’s research is aimed at understanding how, in ALI, an injurious signal is communicated
from alveoli to microvessels, resulting in microvascular hyperpermeability and pulmonary edema. Dr. Hough
has found that mitochondria in microvessels can sense injury through oxidative activation of the proton channel
uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2). UCP2 activation is necessary for microvascular hyperpermeability and
pulmonary edema. This proposal uses microscopy of live mouse lungs. Using this specialized technique, Dr.
Hough can view individual alveoli in real-time and observe the immediate effects of lung injury on mitochondria
in alveoli and microvessels. In this proposal, Dr. Hough will expand her research to ask four questions: (1)
Does a prolonged inflammatory injury, such as pneumonia or high tidal volume mechanical ventilation, cause
barrier failure in a UCP2-dependent manner?; (2) Does UCP2 activation in endothelium underlie lung injury
from non-pulmonary causes, such as sepsis?; (3) Is there a directionality of oxidative signaling exclusively from
alveolus to capillary, or can the signaling be bidirectional?; and (4) Does UCP2 underlie barrier failure and
severe hypoxemia in the young?
This proposal details a 5-year research plan designed to give Dr. Hough a foundation as an independent
investigator. Dr. Hough will conduct a novel mechanistic research project under the mentorship of outstanding
lung researcher Dr. Jahar Bhattacharya, and the co-mentorship of renowned development lung biologist Dr.
Wellington Cardoso. She will (1) develop her expertise in real-time fluorescence imaging of live mouse lungs
and human lungs from deceased donors, as well as animal models of lung injury, (2) build a network of
collaborators via participation at national meetings, and (3) prepare and submit an independent federal
research grant within 5 years. As a pediatric intensivist, Dr. Hough aims to take what she has learned about
UCP2 and its importance in barrier failure associated with ARDS and apply this knowledge to infants and
children."

For the first time in decades, HIV incidence is increasing among people who inject drugs (PWID). Pre-
exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a safe, effective, evidence-based HIV prevention strategy recommended for at-
risk PWID. However, despite the acceptability of PrEP among PWID, access remains low, and uptake has
lagged far behind that observed in other vulnerable populations. Our preliminary research demonstrates that
syringe service programs (SSPs) are uniquely poised to improve PrEP access, and many already provide
some services along the PrEP delivery cascade, including PrEP education, HIV testing, and linkage to onsite
and external medical services. Despite being ideal venues for improving PrEP access among PWID, our data
demonstrate that these agencies need additional support to optimally implement the SSP-based PrEP delivery
cascade. This novel randomized controlled trial (RCT) uses an interrupted time series design to test whether
an evidence-based, organization-level intervention, the Systems Analysis and Improvement Approach (SAIA),
can improve the delivery of PrEP services among 32 SSPs located in Ending the HIV Epidemic priority
jurisdictions. After a 3-month run-in period, SSPs will be randomized to receive SAIA (n=16) versus treatment
as usual (n=16). SAIA will be delivered by trained specialists through five cyclical steps over 12 months: (1)
analyze SSPs’ PrEP delivery cascade to identify priority areas for system improvements, (2) map processes
and build consensus around programmatic modifications to address priority areas, (3) implement programmatic
modifications, (4) assess effects of programmatic modifications on delivery of cascade services, and (5) repeat
steps 1-4 as needed. SSPs will use an electronic data collection system to report on outcomes including
numbers of SSP clients receiving (1) PrEP education, (2) HIV testing, (3) PrEP linkage, and (4) PrEP initiation
verification. Data will be collected during the 3-month run-in period prior to randomization, and then for an
additional 24 months, allowing us to identify initial impacts of SAIA after 12 months (Aim 1) and sustained
impacts at 24 months (Aim 2). Outcomes will be disaggregated by sex and race/ethnicity to allow for process
monitoring of programmatic changes to address equity in service delivery. We will also estimate the cost and
cost-effectiveness of SAIA relative to treatment as usual using an activity-based costing approach (Aim 3). To
our knowledge, this will be the first RCT of an organizational-level intervention to optimize the SSP-based
PrEP delivery cascade. If successful, SAIA could be disseminated to the ≥430 SSPs nationally and in global
settings, carrying the potential for exceptional impact amidst persistent HIV transmission in PWID."

Proteostatic mechanisms fail with advancing age, resulting in the accumulation of damaged and dysfunctional
proteins. Protein breakdown and replacement with newly synthesized proteins (protein turnover) is the primary
mechanism to mitigate accumulation of damaged proteins over time. There are several conflicting findings
related to protein turnover, aging, and treatments that slow aging, which leave the field with fundamental
contradictions regarding protein turnover as a proteostatic mechanism. The current project seeks to
understand the fundamental mechanisms that regulate proteostatic maintenance so that we can
overcome a barrier to targeting this pillar of aging to slow age-related decline. Our studies indicate that:
1) aging does not universally decrease protein turnover, and in fact it increases the turnover of many proteins,
2) aging deceases the number of proteins that turnover (for which we introduce the term dynamic pool size), 3)
treatments that extend lifespan have nearly an equal number of proteins that increase and decrease protein
synthesis, which contradicts the notion that treatments that extend lifespan slow protein synthesis, and 4) some
treatments that increase lifespan decrease cell proliferation, which by itself decreases protein turnover in a non-
determinant manner. To date, these studies have been limited to tissue samples, which has restricted the
understanding of how individual cell types within a tissue influence overall tissue proteostasis. To overcome
these unknowns, the proposed studies use mouse models that allow cell-specific isolation of proteins and nuclei
in skeletal muscle and brain. The project will use both discovery-based and targeted proteomics with novel
deuterium oxide (D2O) labeling to examine cell-type-specific individual protein turnover and cell replication.
Through loss of proteostatic maintenance (aging) and gain of proteostatic maintenance (treatments that slow
aging), we will address the following specific aims: to determine cell-type specific proteins susceptible to
proteostatic decline with aging, to determine how a treatment that inhibits mTOR improves proteostasis, and to
determine how a treatment that does not directly inhibit mTOR improves proteostasis. The hypotheses are that:
the loss of proteostasis with aging results from cell-type specific changes in individual protein turnover rates and
decreases in the dynamic protein pool size, that inhibiting mTOR improves proteostatic maintenance by
decreasing cell proliferation while increasing turnover and dynamic pool size of proteins that are susceptible to
proteostatic decline, and that a lifespan-extending treatment that does not directly inhibit mTOR improves
proteostatic maintenance by mechanisms that do not include slowed cell proliferation. Progress toward targeting
age-related proteostatic deterioration has been hindered by contradictory and paradoxical results from protein
turnover studies. We expect that our approaches will narrow the scope of proteins susceptible to proteostatic
decline, and more importantly, will make significant advancements toward strategies to target these proteins to
maintain proteostasis with age."

The overarching goals of the Tumor Immunology Training Program (TITP) at Roswell Park Comprehensive
Cancer Center Graduate Division are to educate, train, and prepare talented pre-doctoral trainees for a
profession in cancer immunology research. Driven by significant advances in understanding how the immune
system can be weaponized against cancer, future leaders in tumor immunology will not only be well-trained in
the discipline, but also will have a strong appreciation of the potential translational impact to human cancer
biology and therapy. The unique, cancer-focus of the TITP introduces trainees to an advanced didactic and
conceptual cancer immunology educational paradigm that encapsulates knowledge spanning the continuum of
basic science to clinical application. The uniqueness of this TITP is further enhanced by the integration of an
academic environment comprised of diverse faculty concentrated within a prestigious NCI-designated
Comprehensive Cancer Center. Throughout the program, trainees are continually exposed to a
comprehensive portfolio of themes and concepts in tumor immunology, responsible conduct of research, and
the principles of rigor and reproducibility. Trainees conduct their doctoral research with TITP mentors with
expertise in basic, translational, and clinical tumor immunology. The primary mission of the TITP is to support
competitively selected trainees during their third and fourth years of study. The funds requested cover
stipends and tuition for 4 pre-doctoral trainees per year. This funding is crucial to continue the upward
trajectory experienced for nearly 20 years of NRSA support in the quality and diversity of pre-doctoral trainees
focused on complex and challenging immunologic questions in cancer. NRSA-supported trainees are
prepared for a competitive biomedical career through didactic lectures and concept-driven learning in tumor
immunology and biology, grant writing, responsible conduct of research, and rigor and reproducibility. After
trainees complete all formal course work and pass a qualifying exam, degree conferral is dependent upon
fulfilling a first-authored publication requirement and passing the dissertation defense reflecting the novel and
original findings of the trainee’s body-of-work. Trainees who complete this TITP will be well-versed in all major
facets of tumor immunology and will have the solid foundation upon which to build cancer-focused careers,
guided by a clear vision of its impact on human cancer biology and treatment."

The increasing rise in antibiotic resistance and the diminished discovery of new antimicrobials threatens global
healthcare. Of particular concern are Gram-negative pathogens, organisms with an additional outer membrane
(OM) that provides intrinsic resistance to multiple classes of antibiotics. Unlike the inner membrane (IM) that is
composed solely of glycerophospholipids (GPLs), the OM is asymmetrical with GPLs found in the inner leaflet
and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) localized to the outer leaflet. This unique membrane asymmetry affords
protection from large polar molecules, as well as lipophilic compounds, creating an impervious barrier. Since
the OM is essential, pathways required for its assembly are key targets for antimicrobial design. Currently,
there are no antibiotics that directly target OM biogenesis in clinical use. Thus, it remains critical to investigate
cell envelope biogenesis for future and current antimicrobial design.
Over the last few decades, we have expanded our understanding of OM assembly revealing new targets for
antimicrobial design. However, one major gap remained. How are GPLs transported from the IM to the OM
across the aqueous periplasm? Recently, we discovered that key members of the AsmA-like family (YhdP,
TamB, and YdbH) are critical for OM integrity and involved in GPL transport. We found that YhdP, TamB, and
YdbH are redundant in their role in OM lipid homeostasis; however, they are not equivalent. Notably, all three
proteins share homology and structural features with eukaryotic GPL transporters and are capable of spanning
the periplasm. The overall objective of this application is to investigate the molecular mechanisms required
for the assembly and maintenance of the Gram-negative OM. More specifically, we will characterize pathways
required to transport GPLs across the cell envelope using E. coli as the model system. In the current
application we will (i) characterize the major GPL transporters (YhdP, TamB, and YdbH), (ii) identify accessory
proteins required for GPL transbilayer movement, and (iii) determine how loss of these systems impact OM
lipid homeostasis and antibiotic resistance."

Cardiometabolic diseases (CMD), including obesity, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension, are the
leading cause of disease burden in the world with a disproportionate impact on historically marginalized
populations. In the first funding period of our project, The Hispanic/Latino Lipid Consortium (HLLC), our efforts
centered on discovering genetic factors impacting serum lipid levels, obesity, and T2D in self-identified
Hispanic/Latinos (HL), a population with significant CMD health disparities. This highly impactful research, which
has resulted in 39 published papers to-date, leveraged extant genetic data as well as new genetic data generated
for the project in >63k participants to identify multiple new CMD loci. We also characterized the regulatory
mechanisms influencing lipid levels using a new resource of whole blood (WB) gene expression profiles in 880
HL participants. Yet, the mechanism of action of most GWAS signals and the molecular pathways
disrupted in metabolic tissues are still not well understood. As such, in the second funding period of the
HLLC, we propose to build on our remarkable success and experience generating and analyzing transcriptomic
data in HL. Here, we aim to investigate the role of multi-tissue gene expression (WB and subcutaneous adipose
tissue [SAT]) and changes in WB expression over time with the goal of identifying key modifiable molecular
signatures associated with CMDs in an even larger, more diverse sample of HL. Specifically, we propose to:
first, identify multi-tissue transcriptomic patterns associated with CMD and related traits (obesity, type 2
diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension measures) in recently acquired WB RNA sequencing data from 14k HL
participants as well as in 300 SAT tissue specimens from HL participants recruited for the present application;
second, identify longitudinal changes in WB transcriptomic data associated with changes in CMD-related risk
factors in participants from the HLCC (1500 RNA measures from 750 participants with an average of 5 years
between the two RNA sequencing measures for each person); and third, conduct integrative analyses of genetic
and transcriptomic data to establish causality via Mendelian Randomization and characterize existing genomic
findings with functional evidence. Our aims are entirely independent, exceptionally well powered, and designed
to answer critical questions about the causal pathways underlying observed transcriptomic differences in CMD.
This work will result in creation of a publicly available resource of eQTL information for metabolic tissues in HL
and identify novel targets for early prevention and pharmaceutical intervention. Significantly, by addressing CMD
risk in an under-represented population, our work contributes directly to the NIH’s mission to promote disease
prevention and treatment in historically marginalized populations."
10842290,"Summary
Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) accounts for 3-4% of all pediatric cancers, with less than a 30% overall 5-year survival
rate for children diagnosed with metastatic RMS. Sarcoma patients also experience higher rates of morbidity and
mortality than other cancer patients, and this is particularly evident in children. As a result of their therapies, 42%
of childhood cancer survivors experience severe, disabling, or life threatening conditions, including secondary
tumors. Thus, there is clearly a need to develop new, more targeted treatment strategies for pediatric tumors
such as RMS; treatments that inhibit tumor progression yet confer limited side effects. In many cancers,
embryonic programs, including the acquisition of stem/progenitor states, are instituted to contribute to tumor
progression. Such reinstatement or retention of developmental programs may be a key driving factor in
Embryonal Rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS, which are generally fusion negative and also referred to as FN-RMS).
In RMS, high expression of myogenic-lineage transcription factors (TF), MYOD1 and MYOG, is observed.
However, despite high expression of these TFs, RMS cells fail to differentiate. Instead, these TFs drive the RMS
malignant phenotype, since knockout of these MRFs results in lethality to the RMS cell. Thus, a key unanswered
question in the field is why and how the myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) depart from their canonical roles as
drivers of muscle differentiation to instead maintain RMS cells in an undifferentiated state. In this proposal, we
are examining whether SIX1, a critical TF that regulates muscle development, is responsible for globally altering
the function of MRFs. Our data show that elevated SIX1 expression promotes FN-RMS progression and growth
by promoting an RMS progenitor-like state. Intriguingly, SIX1 knockdown induces a muscle differentiation
signature, concomitant with re-localization of key MRFs genome-wide. These data suggest that in FN-RMS, SIX1
overexpression alters MRF function, promoting an RMS progenitor-like phenotype and enhancing tumor growth
and progression. Thus, in this proposal we will test the following hypothesis: SIX1 and its obligate cofactors
EYA2/3 cooperatively drive the progression of FN-RMS by altering the genomic landscape, causing MRFs
to favor growth over differentiation. Since SIX1 expression in differentiated tissues is low, targeting it may
therefore be a means to inhibit FN-RMS with limited side effects to untransformed cells where SIX1 is
dispensable. Specific aims are as follows: 1) To determine the molecular mechanism by which SIX1 serves as
a master regulator of the muscle progenitor vs differentiated state in development and in RMS. 2) To identify the
critical SIX1 cofactors (with a focus on EYA proteins) that, when targeted, can induce differentiation and inhibit
RMS growth. This work will take advantage of normal developmental regulatory mechanisms to inhibit the tumor,
and thus may have limited toxicity due to the paucity of SIX/EYA expression in adult tissue. Our ability to combine
zebrafish and human models will maximize the benefits of each model system to rapidly and inexpensively
identify means to inhibit RMS growth and progression. Understanding the mechanisms by which RMS cells are
trapped in an early developmental state may therefore lead to novel means to target the disease."
10933421,"PROJECT SUMMARY
During development, a series of extracellular signals lead to the formation of different cell-types by inducing the
differential expression of many genes. Although all genes experience the same signal, the expression of some
genes is increased, some reduced, and others stay the same. Therefore, the gene expression profile that is
characteristic of any cell-type must result from each genomic locus interpreting the signal in a distinct manner.
The loss of faithful signal interpretation by genomic loci is pathogenic in many contexts including cancer and
neuropsychiatric disease. Thus, an understanding of how individual genomic loci interpret extracellular signals
is a fundamental yet unresolved problem. The challenge in understanding cis-regulation in response to
extracellular signals is two-fold. First, any manipulation of the signal (concentration, duration, identity) leads to
myriad pleiotropic effects in trans that confound interpretation. Second, multiple cis-regulatory elements
(CREs) work together across large genomic windows to specify the expression of their target gene. Even in
this post-CRISPR era, it has remained challenging to simultaneously manipulate multiple CREs across these
large genomic regions to deconvolve their relative contributions to target gene regulation. This proposal seeks
to solve these challenges using a combination of synthetic biology and single-cell sequencing.
At the HoxA cluster, extracellular signals such as retinoic acid (RA) and Wnt induce the establishment of
distinct transcriptional, epigenetic and topological domains that are stably inherited through cell divisions. In
Aim1, we will rewire the HoxA cluster to respond to an extracellular signal that is completely orthogonal to the
rest of the genome. This will enable the independent manipulation of transcription factor binding in cis and
changes to the trans-regulatory environment to determine their relative contributions in establishing and
maintaining the HoxA response to differentiating signals.
We are unlikely to glean generally applicable principles of gene regulation from studies of a single locus. In
Aim2 we will develop a technology that uses single-cells as individual experiments to massively increase the
scale at which interactions between CREs can be uncovered at any locus. This technology will be applied to
dissect the regulatory landscapes of genes involved in neuronal cell-type specification. We will then use the
large dataset to develop a predictive model of cis-regulation at other loci."

10845370,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment (CICI) is a condition commonly reported in cancer patients, where
learning, memory, attention, and executive functions are impaired following cancer chemotherapy treatment. To
date, the most common genetic risk factor associated with CICI is the APOE4 gene, which is also the strongest
genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s Disease. Little is known about how APOE4 affects excitatory and inhibitory
neurons in the entorhinal cortex (a region of the brain critical for information gating between the cerebral cortex
and the hippocampus) and how those differences may make APOE4 neurons more susceptible to environmental
stress. Using our novel mouse model of CICI that combines the effects of a chemotherapeutic challenge
(doxorubicin) and genetic susceptibility (APOE4 genotype), I hypothesize that APOE4-TR mice have a deficit
in inhibitory neuron function which prevents them from responding to chemotherapy in a protective
manner. I will test two specific hypotheses in this proposal: 1) APOE4-TR mice are vulnerable to the effects of
chemotherapy due to an inability to preserve parvalbumin interneuron dendritic complexity in the entorhinal
cortex, leading to synaptic excitation-inhibition (E/I) imbalance and 2) apoE isoform levels drive the difference in
circuit dysfunction in APOE4-TR mice treated with chemotherapy. The following aims will investigate how APOE
genotype and chemotherapy affect entorhinal cortex circuitry: Aim 1: Examine mechanisms underlying entorhinal
cortex circuit dysfunction in CICI. I will use a combination of electrophysiology, confocal microscopy, and
transgenic mice to measure changes in E/I balance and interrogate underlying causes of E/I dysregulation in the
presence and absence of chemotherapy. Aim 2: Test whether increasing apoE levels protects against entorhinal
cortex circuit dysfunction in CICI. I will use an AAV construct to introduce astrocytic-apoE3 into APOE3 and
APOE4 mice treated with chemotherapy. Changes to E/I balance will be measured to assess if apoE levels
minimize vulnerability to CICI. These aims will collectively identify circuit-based mechanisms underlying CICI.
Outcomes of this proposal can provide clinical guidance on 1) identifying at-risk patients prior to chemotherapy
treatment and 2) reducing the likelihood of CICI by altering apoE levels."
10932191,"Abstract
Problematic alcohol involvement (PAI), characterized by alcohol consumption that leads to or increases risk for
acute and/or chronic negative consequences in one or more life domains, poses an enormous public health
burden to drinkers, their families, and society. Heterogeneity in PAI’s etiology has been identified as the single
most important barrier to progress in remediating this burden. More effective characterization of neurobehavioral
traits that increase PAI risk is critical to the development of more effective intervention and prevention efforts.
Cognitive science approaches to addiction etiology have suggested PAI risk reflects an interaction between two
internal cognitive systems: appetitive motivation for alcohol (AMA) impelling alcohol seeking and use, and
executive function (EF) regulating the influence of appetitive drives. This Dual Process Model has been highly
influential, but prior studies have failed to support its main interaction hypothesis. We argue this failure is
attributable to weaknesses in the rigor of prior research, and propose several innovative refinements to the DPM
framework to improve its predictive utility. First, individual differences in AMA and EF have not been adequately
characterized in prior studies, most of which represent these constructs with single indicators. Innovations in
neuroclinical assessment indicate that neurobehavioral trait constructs are better characterized with measures
representing self-report, behavioral, and neurophysiological units of analysis. Second, DPMs assume risk for
PAI reflects only the influence of internal processes, implying no role for context. This is a major limitation, as
strong evidence indicates that both environmental contexts (e.g., legal constraints; alcohol access) and alcohol
exposure (e.g., acute effects of alcohol on EF and AMA) strongly affect the extent to which person-level factors
relate to PAI. Finally, given that PAI behaviors are the result of decisions people make while drinking, accounting
for heterogeneity in drinking-related decision strategies can improve prediction of PAI, including the role of DPM
constructs. We propose a multi-session, within-subject alcohol challenge experiment, combined with online
follow-up assessments, structured to take advantage of the abrupt change in contextual factors that occurs with
transition to the minimum legal drinking age (MLDA; i.e., 21st birthday). This transition broadly increases risk for
PAI within persons, but little is known about the role of specific etiologic factors in this increased risk. Participants
(N=220) will be recruited from rural census tracts in mid-Missouri, identified through state administrative and
driver’s license databases. Such individuals are broadly underrepresented in PAI research, particularly alcohol
challenge research, and tend to experience more chronic (less transient) and severe PAI than their relatively
advantaged, college-attending age peers. This sampling approach also will permit over-sampling of individuals
at higher risk for DUI arrest (e.g., based on parental history of DUI and area characteristics). Thus, this study will
fill important gaps in knowledge concerning PAI etiologic factors in an understudied population."
10902101,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Millions of children undergo general anesthesia each year, and animal and human studies have
indicated that exposure to anesthesia at an early age can impact neuronal development, leading
to behavioral and learning impairments that manifest later in childhood and adolescence.
However, little is known about the methods which can be used to evaluate these impairments.
Our preliminary and published data suggest that changes in regional resting state functional
MRI (rsfMRI) can reflect the status of local neuronal networks and can have a predictive value
for anesthesia-induced learning deficiency. Regional rsfMRI depends on the regulation of local
brain tissue oxygen. Based on published and preliminary data we hypothesize that brain tissue
oxygen and regional rsfMRI regulation are modulated by GABAergic neurons (interneurons) but
neonatal anesthesia disrupts the development of this modulation and produces a specific
signature on the rsfMRI signal. In Aim 1 we will determine the mechanisms responsible for
regional rsfMRI and brain tissue oxygen regulation under normal conditions and after neonatal
anesthesia exposure by using brain tissue oxygen, BOLD fMRI, electrophysiological recordings,
local pharmacological and optogenetic approach in adults. In Aim 2 we will determine how the
development of regional rsfMRI and brain tissue oxygen fluctuations is affected by neonatal
anesthesia exposure and find time points when rsfMRI can predict the future behavioral
deficiency. Behavioral tests, local rsfMRI, brain tissue oxygen, and neuronal activity will be
recorded in across multiple time points after neonatal anesthesia exposure and in the control
group. The results of the proposed work will provide a clear picture of how the regulation of
brain tissue oxygen is affected by neonatal anesthesia exposure and will offer strong
translational value of resting-state fMRI to predict learning deficiency."

Delivery of early childhood vaccines using an established schedule is a key strategy for infectious disease
control in the United States. However, between 50% and 75% of U.S. children experience undervaccination,
defined as either getting some or all recommended vaccines late or not getting them at all, before their 2nd
birthday. Outbreaks of measles, pertussis, and other vaccine-preventable diseases have been linked to
children who were behind on or missing vaccines, either due to parental vaccine hesitancy or other barriers to
accessing immunization services. There are currently no systematic, population-based approaches for
tracking adherence to the U.S. recommended immunization schedule, or the prevalence of parents who
choose to deviate from the recommended schedule. Furthermore, standard measures are inadequate for
identifying the reasons why we fail to achieve vaccine coverage goals, which is a particular problem in
populations that experience immunization disparities, including children living in the rural U.S. For this project,
we will analyze 11 years of public use data collected in the National Immunization Survey-Child (NIS-Child) to
quantify four novel measures of early childhood immunization services quality: (1) vaccine timeliness, (2)
immunization schedule adherence, (3) undervaccination due to parental vaccine hesitancy, and (4)
undervaccination due to other access barriers. In our analyses of this nationally representative data source,
we will identify trends in and factors associated with these measures in the U.S. overall in 2011-2019 (Specific
Aim 1a), for each U.S. state in 2011-2019 (Specific Aim 1b), and assess how the COVID-19 pandemic affected
these trends in 2020-2021 (Specific Aim 1c). We will use mixed effects log-binomial models and zero-inflated
Poisson models, as well as piecewise regression methods, to determine how time, socioeconomic,
demographic, and other factors have affected these immunization quality measures in and across the U.S.
Then, we will access restricted use NIS-Child data to determine how trends in and factors associated with
immunization schedule adherence and specific undervaccination patterns are modified by rurality (Specific Aim
2). Our proposed analyses, along with our dissemination efforts, will contribute to the long-term goal of
establishing methods for routine surveillance of these early childhood immunization services quality measures
at national, state, and some local levels. Furthermore, this study will establish new data-driven methods for
distinguishing between undervaccination due to parental vaccine hesitancy versus other healthcare access
barriers; an important distinction, since interventions to address these two types of barriers fundamentally
differ. The results from this project, and particularly the examinations of effect modification by rurality, will
inform targeted interventions for increasing on-time vaccination and immunization schedule adherence,
decreasing vaccine-preventable disease risk, and achieving immunization coverage equity in early childhood."
10864998,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
African American adults (AAs), compared to White adults, are half as likely to be screened for depression in
primary care settings. Disparities in depression screening contribute to poor clinical outcomes, as AAs with
depression are more disabled, sicker longer, and less likely to seek treatment compared to Whites. Black
churches are trusted settings that provide “de facto” mental health services for depression. Indeed, in the first
study of its kind, the study team found that 20% of adults in Black churches screened positive for depression
using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). However, no subjects with a positive screen (PHQ-9 ≥10)
accepted a treatment referral when offered by research coordinators onsite for each screening. Community Health
Workers (CHWs), who are trusted para-professionals from the target community, may bridge the gap between depression
screening and treatment. We have trained and certified 102 CHWs from 42 Black churches in Harlem to deliver an
evidence-based intervention called Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT), which is centered
on culturally tailored Motivational Interviewing (MI). Thus, the scientific premise of this study is that employing
CHWs to implement depression screening in Black churches will bridge the gap between church-based
depression-screening and engagement with clinical providers. Using a Hybrid Type 1 Effectiveness-
Implementation design, we propose a 2-arm, mixed-methods Cluster-Randomized Controlled Trial within 30 Black
churches our CHWs currently attend. Based on our pilot data, we expect 20% of adults (n=600) to have a positive
depression screen. Adults will be randomized based on church study site to either SBIRT (n=15 churches) or Referral As
Usual (RAU, n=15 churches). We will then compare the effectiveness of SBIRT (Intervention arm) to RAU (Usual Care
arm) on treatment engagement (primary outcome), defined as attending a depression-related clinical visit for which the
subject reported receiving information, referral, counseling, or medication for depression (Aim 1). We will then compare
changes in Mental Health Related Quality of Life and depressive symptoms (secondary outcomes) at 3- and 6-months
post-screening (Aim 2). Finally, we will conduct a concurrent, mixed-methods (qualitative-quantitative) process
evaluation to assess contextual facilitators and barriers of screening and referral (Aim 3). This study has potential for
large-scale public health impact as 20 to 22 million Americans attend the 65,000 to 70,000 Black churches in the U.S."
10894326,"Knowledge of the factors influencing pathogen spread in vector populations is critical for understanding
dynamics of disease incidence, development of risk assessment strategies for novel pathogen introductions and
development of transmission biomarkers that can be used to efficiently target control efforts. Although novel
pathogens such as Zika virus receive inordinate media attention, the Category B Priority Pathogen West Nile
Virus (WNV) is the most widespread locally transmitted mosquito-borne pathogen in the USA. Since its
introduction in 1999, WNV spread completely across the United States with over 50,000 confirmed human
cases and over 2,000 deaths. The most efficient laboratory vector is Culex tarsalis, which has been identified as
a very important vector in the western United States. Our recent work showed strong correlation between the
genetic structure of Cx. tarsalis and the invasion pattern of WNV across the western United States; one of the
first studies to directly use mosquito population genetics to implicate their role in pathogen invasion.
Traditionally, variation in vector competence has been attributed to genetic differences between mosquito
strains or individuals. However, no organism exists in isolation; organisms are a community consisting of the
host and its associated microorganisms (bacteria, fungi and viruses) that, collectively, make up the holobiome.
Little is known about the mosquito holobiome factors influencing pathogen invasion in the field. In this
proposal, we will delineate the hologenomic (genetics of the mosquito and its associated microorganism)
factors underlying WNV phenotypic variation across field populations of Cx. tarsalis. Our overall hypothesis is
that variation in the mosquito hologenome determines variation in WNV infection, transmission and/or
dissemination in the field. This hypothesis will be investigated in the following Specific Aims: (1) Delineate
fine-scale landscape genetics of Cx. tarsalis in the United States; (2) Determine the relationship between the
Cx. tarsalis microbiome and WNV infection, dissemination and transmission in field populations of Cx.
tarsalis; and (3) Use a replicated pooled genome-wide association study (PoolGWAS) to identify genomic loci
associated with WNV infection, dissemination and transmission in field populations of Cx. tarsalis.
Identification of hologenomic loci affecting pathogen vector competence and studies of correlated genetic
variation between populations are critical for understanding patterns of pathogen transmission and disease
outbreaks. This work has particular importance for bioterrorism issues because it will provide conceptual
insight into how intrinsic vector hologenomic factors in natural populations affect the epidemiology of a
released Category B agent."

Ion channels control such diverse processes as fertilization, proliferation, development, learning and memory.
Ion channels are multispan transmembrane proteins that transport ~106 to 107 ions per second across
membranes. Precise spatial and temporal regulation of ionic flux is the fundamental principle by which ion
channels control such a diverse array of signaling modalities. Spatial regulation is achieved by targeting channels
to subcellular compartments ensheathed in membranes such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or endosomes,
whereas temporal regulation by specific signals controlling opening and closing of channels. The primary cilium
is an antenna-shaped protrusion from the apical plasma membrane and are enriched in a specific subset of ion
channels called polycystins. Mutations in polycystins cause Autosomal Dominant Polycytsic Kidney Disease
(ADPKD), which manifests in cyst formation in kidney and other organs, such as liver and pancreas. The
molecular mechanisms by which polycystin channels are spatially and temporally regulated and thus contribute
to ciliary signaling cascades still remain poorly understood. The central goal of this project is to understand the
fundamental mechanisms at the molecular and cellular level by which polycystin channels are activated in
primary cilia. There are three specific aims. The first aim defines the molecular motifs in PC1 and PC2 underlying
the temporal regulation of the ciliary polycystin channel complex. The second aims defines the local regulation
of polycystins by ciliary calcium levels. The third aim determine the physiological role of ciliary lipids in restricting
polycystin activity to primary cilia. This proposal includes preliminary observations of two applicants with
complementary expertise on polycystin channel function. Completion of this project will be a critical step towards
understanding the fundamental principles of polycystin channel signaling within primary cilia. Our long‐term goal
is to understand how dysregulation of polycystin channels causes ADPKD."

An integrated approach to Neuropathology is a central element of all studies detailed in the four projects.
Focusing neuropathological aspects of this Program in a core facility allows closer coordination of the efforts of
the Program’s investigators and provides an interface between the Program and key laboratories: Anatomic
Pathology, Clinical / Research Neuropathology, and the VHC. Aside from the obvious benefits that a
Neuropathology Core can provide in terms of concerted experimental design / planning and that come with a
centralized and uniform approach to the processing and assaying of tissues, a Core can facilitate adherence to
regulatory issues relating to the accessioning and processing of human and animal tissues for research, can
produce financial benefits through efficient use of manpower and reagents, and can simplify and secure data
recording and presentation.
Core C pathologists are strategically placed to take advantage of the material they will review, comparing
morphological and immunophenotypic variation in human and mouse CNS tumors in the context of a wealth of
genetic data generated over the Program’s last budget cycle [2-4, 27-33]. The two Core C pathologists have an
interest in the analysis of CNS tumors and proven expertise in this area, as reflected by their publications (see
later in this section and biosketches).
Together with the other project leaders, our Program team has the potential to capitalize on their findings by
producing novel enhancements to the molecular classification of medulloblastomas and pediatric high-grade
gliomas and potentially to lay the foundations for an integrated pathological and molecular approach to the
diagnosis of pediatric CNS tumors, utilizing a combination of detailed histopathological evaluation and novel
molecular markers to classify tumors for the purpose of therapeutic stratification or as suitable for novel targeted
therapies."
10918343,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Antiretroviral therapy (ART) greatly reduces HIV morbidity and mortality. However, it has no effect on the HIV
reservoir, a small pool of latently infected cells that rekindles infection upon treatment interruption. Due to the
persistence of this reservoir, ART must be continued indefinitely, requiring public health systems to deliver
medications to all 38 million people living with HIV for life. This research program has the long-term goal of
helping develop new therapeutic approaches to eliminate or control the HIV reservoir, leading to a drug-free
remission. The proliferation of infected cells is a major mechanism of HIV persistence, as it results in expanded
CD4+ T cell clones that carry proviral DNA. Recent studies suggest that antigen-specific immune responses
contribute largely to this phenomenon. The overall objective of this application is to understand the role of chronic
antigens in determining the structure and dynamics of the clones that constitute the HIV reservoir. The underlying
central hypothesis is that adaptive immune responses impose selective pressure on HIV-infected cells. The
rationale for the project is that, if clonal expansion is one of the major mechanisms of HIV persistence, targeting
this process will reduce the reservoir size and accelerate its decay. The central hypothesis will be tested by
pursuing three specific aims: 1) Determine the effect of antigens on HIV latency reversal; 2) Identify the factors
responsible for the expansion and maintenance of HIV-infected, antigen-specific clones; and 3) Determine the
role of chronic antigens from commensal pathogens in driving reservoir persistence. Under the first aim, CD4+
T cells reactive to Cytomegalovirus (CMV, the virus responsible for a common chronic infection) will be isolated
from individuals with HIV and expanded ex vivo. Upon stimulation of T cells with cognate CMV antigens, HIV
latency will be studied at the single-cell level and compared to non-specific maximal T cell stimulation, commonly
used to reverse latency in vitro. For the second aim, CMV-responsive clones harboring HIV will be tracked
longitudinally in individuals with CMV replication around the time of ART introduction, in the effort to understand
the events underlying their expansion. For the third aim, Candida albicans, a pathogenic commensal yeast that
plays a major role in driving antifungal immune responses, will be used to demonstrate whether chronic exposure
to commensal microbes shapes the repertoire of CD4+ T cells, including those part of the HIV reservoir. The
research proposed in this application is innovative because, compared to the status quo, it focuses on
physiological T cell stimulation and ubiquitous immune responses to study latency reversal and HIV dynamics.
The proposed research is significant because it is expected to result in a better understanding of the interaction
between adaptive immunity and HIV persistence, and will provide new insight on how to target a major
mechanism of HIV reservoir maintenance. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential of offering new
opportunities for the development of innovative strategies to induce HIV remission."

Surgical technical skills directly impact patient outcomes. There remains a need for objective, accurate, and
inexpensive methods to measure such skills in a manner that can scale to the large number of surgical
residents and practitioners. The long term goal of this research program is to improve surgical training and
assessment by establishing more scientifically-rigorous foundations for accurate, objective evaluation of
surgical technical skills and their relationship to surgical outcomes. The overall objective of this research
proposal is to determine the biases, limitations, and absolute accuracy inherent in the putative gold standard
of surgical technical skill evaluation—review of video footage by a panel of human raters—across
representative procedures in three surgical specialties: urology, gynecology, and orthopedic surgery. The
central hypothesis is that both expert and non-expert raters are subject to unconscious bias and limitations in
their capacity to evaluate surgical technical skills objectively and accurately. This will have positive impact on
advancing the science and improving the practice of surgical skill evaluation for surgical residency programs.
The research will answer the following questions, at least for representative procedures from urology (robotic
prostatectomy), gynecology (robotic hysterectomy), and orthopedic surgery (hip fracture fixation and pedicle
screw placement).
 1. What is the magnitude of identity bias (gender, ethnicity, etc.) in the evaluation of surgical technical skills?
 a. How do ratings change from the control condition (identity-blind) to identity-visible for gender, race, age,
 or perceived reputation?
 b. How does this bias change across skill levels? (e.g. preliminary evidence shows that perceived females
 are docked more severely than males among novice skill levels, but less so at proficient levels).
 c. How much do faculty semester evaluations of resident technical skill (current widespread practice) differ
 from identity-blind skill evaluation (anonymized review of video)? Especially across gender?
 2. What is the optimal user interface and conditions for identity-blind web-enabled review of surgical video
 that maximize skill discrimination and minimize reviewer resource cost?
 3. What is the absolute accuracy of human raters? i.e., how imperfect is the gold-standard of technical skill
evaluation"

Abstract
Lung cancer is the single largest contributor to global cancer mortality. With the exception of smoking, age is the
single biggest risk factor for all major lung diseases, including cancer, highlighting the role of age-associated
changes in the lung for mortality. Metabolic changes and epigenetic alterations are both hallmarks of aging, but
little is known about how aging specifically impacts the lung and in particular lung progenitor cells. Furthermore,
the synergy between metabolism and epigenetic states is emerging as an exciting new field for which implications
in disease including cancer are only beginning to be explored. Preliminary data we have collected suggest that
both metabolic and epigenetic changes accompany aging in lung alveolar type II (AT2) cells, the primary cell-of-
origin of the most common form of lung cancer, lung adenocarcinoma. Our study will test the hypothesis that
alterations in metabolic pathways driven by epigenetic changes in AT2 cells contribute to increased tumor
initiation during aging. Firstly, we will map metabolic and epigenetic changes in aged AT2 cells using state of the
art technologies that will enable resolution of these differences onto highly select populations and even single
cells. Furthermore, we will create new models to study the effects of aging in cancer. New organoid models of
lung cancer initiation will be developed to support rapid modeling of the cellular and molecular aspects of cancer
in aged cells. Genetically engineered mouse models will be derived to model tumorigenesis in the aging lung.
Finally, we will probe the specific mechanism by which loss of epigenetic modifications, mediated by the
methyltransferase G9a, during aging contributes to increased tumor initiation through dysregulation of metabolic
genes and the metabolome. These studies will combine the strengths of two experienced PIs with expertise in
aging, metabolism, stem cell biology and cancer to generate new models of lung cancer and provide significant
insight into the synergy of two major hallmarks of aging in the most-deadly form of cancer."

The mechanism of DNA packaging for double-stranded DNA viruses will be studied in the Bacillus
subtilis bacteriophage f29, the most efficient in vitro viral packaging system known. Using an
integrated genetic, biochemical, computational and structural approach, we will characterize protein
conformational change and movement in the transiently assembled packaging motor during DNA
encapsidation. The mechanism of packaging in f29 will serve as a model for animal virus packaging
in the analogous herpesvirus and adenovirus systems, and aid in the search for new antiviral
therapies. Due to similarities between the f29 ATPase and other ring translocases, insights gained
from the study of f29 packaging will also provide insight into the basic principles of macromolecular
motor function in higher organisms. To interrogate the mechanism of DNA packaging we will: 1.
determine the molecular basis for force generation of the packaging motor; 2. elucidate the
mechanism of nucleotide cycling for a complex multimeric ATPase; and 3. describe the nature of
intermolecular communication that coordinates the action of a biological nanomotor."
10692922,"Fatty liver disease is an inflammatory response to accumulation of toxic metabolites within the
liver. In the United States, the progression of fatty liver disease to liver inflammation → fibrosis →
cirrhosis will soon be the leading cause of liver transplantation, especially within the Veteran’s
population; creating a challenge for our country’s Health Care budget. The molecular basis of
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is incompletely understood. Recent findings provide
strong evidence abnormal cholesterol metabolism drives the transition from fatty liver to
inflammation initiated by ER stress pathways. StarD5, a member of the StarD4 subfamily of
proteins that contains a characteristic START domain, is a soluble protein that binds and
translocates cholesterol within the cell. StarD5 is ‘upregulated’ by endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
stress, which makes it a candidate to play a key role in the carrying of cholesterol out of the ER
to maintain ER integrity. We have shown in preliminary observations shown that lack of StarD5
in hepatocytes can lead to a decrease in plasma membrane (PM) cholesterol and fluidity, an
increase in cholesterol and its potential inflammatory metabolites, a decrease in neutral lipid
(triglyceride) secretion, an increase in neutral lipid accumulation (triglycerides), subsequent
development of insulin resistance, and progression to steatohepatitis and ensuing transcriptional
activation of fibrotic pathways. Furthermore, the storing of higher levels of cholesterol and
triglycerides in StarD5-/- mouse livers, which is markedly exasperated with Western diet feeding,
leads to altered expression of cholesterol-regulated genes. Conversely, preliminary studies show
StarD5’s restoration in StarD5-/- livers, using an AAV9-StarD5 liver-selective overexpression
vector, is capable of reversing changes and protecting against ER stress. These observations
demonstrate an ‘adaptive protective role’ of StarD5 in NAFLD. Lipids, including cholesterol, have
been shown to be moved between membranes by non-vesicular lipid transfer proteins (LTP),
transfer that it is fueled by Phosphatidylinositols (PIPs). LTPs that target the ER have an FFAT
motif (diphenylalanine [FF] in an acidic tract [AT]) that interact with ER proteins. We have
identified a potential FFAT motif in the StarD5 protein that is conserved among species. In cells
transfected with the FFAT motif mutated, StarD5 does not interact with the PM, cells have less
accessible PM cholesterol, and, upon PIPs incubation, cells do not increase PM cholesterol as
they do in cells transfected with the WT StarD5. We hypothesize that StarD5 functions in the
physiologic maintenance of cholesterol homeostasis by moving cholesterol out of the ER. In
doing so, in cells with high or readily inducible levels of cholesterol, like hepatocytes, it prevents
accumulation of cholesterol and neutral lipids by moving cholesterol to the PM and potentiating
lipoprotein assembly and secretion. We propose to 1) characterize the role of StarD5 in the
intracellular movement of cholesterol in hepatocytes, including its role in VLDL assembly and
secretion; 2) characterize the molecular mechanisms involved in the transfer of StarD5-mediated
cholesterol; 3) characterize the in vivo role of StarD5 in the development of fatty liver disease.
The proposed studies will likely unveil a novel biologic pathway showing StarD5 plays a key role
in maintaining physiological cholesterol levels within the ER, inhibiting lipid accumulation, and
providing protection against the development of fatty liver disease."

Influenza A affects 5-30% of the world’s population annually, resulting in 3 to 5 million cases of serious illness
and 250,000 to 500,000 deaths each year. Vaccination is the best way to prevent disease. >80% of the
influenza vaccines are made in eggs, and this makes the process slow and not able to quickly change as the
influenza virus mutates. The vaccine is optimized to grow in eggs, which makes it a less like the circulating
virus, and thus reduces the effectiveness of the vaccine. One way to improve the vaccine is to use cell-based
vaccines. However, cells-based vaccines are expensive to produce and the manufacturing facilities are
expensive. After 10 years on the market, cell-based vaccines are not the dominate vaccine used in the US. We
propose to develop a novel manufacturing process of a cell-based influenza virus like particle (VLP). The
process will continuously produce the VLP, which will allow for smaller equipment and thus reduce the cost of
building a new manufacturing plant. Continuous processing also reduces operating costs, allowing for the
vaccine to be sold at a lower cost and likely competing in price with egg-produced vaccines. The VLP will elicit
a stronger immune response than egg-based vaccines and the modular design will allow for quick adaption of
the vaccine to the circulating influenza strains. Our team has designed a novel, end to end, continuous process
to manufacture an influenza VLP. First, we will continuous produce the VLP in a unique, three-reactor
bioreactor cascade that will allow for continuous processing using a baculovirus production system in Sf9
insect cells. There is not currently a continuous baculovirus production system in use. The continuous
downstream will use aqueous two-phase extraction and other polishing steps to purify the VLP.
Chromatography and other periodic operations will be avoided. The VLP will produce HA protein antigenically
identical to the chosen circulating strain with no potential for selection of HA mutations and the HA protein can
easily be changed to another circulating influenza strain, as needed. Process analytics will be conducted to
confirm the purity and antigenicity of the produced influenza VLP. At the completion of this project, the team
will run the first end to end continuous process for one month to produce an influenza VLP and the process
economics will be evaluated to determine the economic feasibility of the process. The VLP will have superior
immunogenicity to egg-derived vaccines and subunit vaccines. This will be the first ever demonstration of a
truly end-to-end continuous VLP production process that will revolutionize biologics manufacturing for multiple
products, including other vaccines and gene therapy vectors."
10927333,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Among working-age U.S. adults, diabetic retinopathy remains the leading cause of blindness despite
landmark National Eye Institute (NEI) clinical trials showing that early detection and treatment reduce the risk of
severe vision loss by over 90%. Yet adherence with yearly diabetic retinopathy screening in the U.S remains
below half of patients in rural communities. Ocular telemedicine (i.e. teleophthalmology) can substantially
increase diabetic retinopathy screening rates and prevent blindness. However, there is often very limited use of
this technology even after a teleophthalmology program is established in multi-payer health systems, where the
majority of Americans receive their care. To overcome major barriers identified for teleophthalmology use in rural
multi-payer primary care clinics, the PI developed and piloted Implementation to Sustain Impact in
Teleophthalmology (I-SITE) in a NEI K23 Career Development Award. I-SITE is the first implementation program
specifically designed to overcome barriers to teleophthalmology use by tailoring its integration into rural primary
care clinic workflows. The proposed study is a multi-center randomized controlled trial aiming to: (1) test the
effectiveness of I-SITE, (2) identify explanatory factors and implementation components that distinguish high
and low teleophthalmology use in rural health systems following I-SITE implementation, and (3) evaluate
implementation costs. We hypothesize that I-SITE will sustain significant diabetic eye screening rate increases
at 18 months compared to usual care teleophthalmology.
 This UG1 proposal directly responds to multiple elements of the NEI Strategic Plan, including areas of
emphasis in telemedicine, diabetic retinopathy, and expanding access to eye care in rural populations. This
research will facilitate the effective translation of telemedicine technology in rural multi-payer primary care clinics
to improve diabetic retinopathy screening rates. The effective integration and scale-up of ocular telemedicine
would greatly expand eye care access for millions of rural Americans. This will be critical for preventing avoidable
blindness by overcoming the shortage of eye care providers and meeting the increased demand for eye
screening resulting from major projected increases in diabetes prevalence. As we face
unprecedented challenges to our nation's health systems, never before in our history has the need for a
rapid transition to telehealth been more acute. Our study will provide vital knowledge regarding the
methods and factors needed to successfully translate telehealth technology into widespread clinical
practice for improving public health nationwide."

Pathologic tissue fibrosis, impelled by uncontrolled wound healing responses to acute or chronic injury is a
significant problem in many organs including kidney, lung, and liver. Liver fibrosis is a major health problem
that causes morbidity and mortality in the affected patient population. Liver fibrosis occurs in various
pathologies including chronic alcohol exposure, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) that can lead to non-
alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and viral infection, and can lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. A
number of molecular mechanisms have been scrutinized to identify the root causes of liver fibrosis. Among these,
prominent studies point to aberrant Hedgehog (Hh) and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling as prime
factors underlying the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis, and hence extensively investigated. Accumulating evidence
also suggests the role of Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs) in mediating the inflammatory responses of liver cells to
endogenous factors and bacterial products present in the liver in NAFLD and NASH.
At MAX BioPharma, we have identified semi-synthetic oxysterols that act as Hh pathway modulators, both as
agonists and antagonists. We found oxysterol Hh pathway antagonists that also have potent inhibitory effects
on TGF-β signaling in fibroblastic cells and in primary human hepatic stellate cells (HSC). With support from
an SBIR Phase 1 grant from NIDDK, we recently published findings about the anti-NASH properties of an
oxysterol analogue, Oxy210, that has led to the present application. Oxy210 has anti-fibrotic as well as anti-
inflammatory properties that are mediated through inhibition of Hh, TGF-β and TLR signaling. Oxy210 induced
robust inhibitory effects in a humanized hyperlipidemic mouse model of NASH, ApoE*3-Leiden.CETP mice on
a high fat Western Diet, evidenced by inhibition of hepatic lipid deposition, inflammatory cytokine expression
and fibrosis, associated with reduced hepatic cell apoptosis and improved circulating ALT levels. Based on
these properties of Oxy210, in addition to its favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profiles, oral availability, and
scalability, in the present SBIR Phase 2 application we propose to continue the examination of the disease
modifying effects of Oxy210 in ApoE*3-Leiden.CETP mice in reversing already established disease in contrast to
our published report when Oxy210 was administered at the initiation of the disease. We propose to identify the
molecular and cellular mechanisms of anti-NASH properties of Oxy210 by performing metabolic tests as well
as RNA-sequencing studies in livers of NASH mice with or without Oxy210 treatment. We propose to perform
non-GLP in vitro and in vivo safety studies that will provide essential information for future IND-enabling GLP
studies required in our anticipated IND filing for Oxy210 as a first-in-class new drug candidate for targeting
NASH. NASH is a huge unmet medical need since there are no FDA approved therapies, leaving a large
global population susceptible to severe liver failure and the need for liver transplantation."

Since 1997, the Training Program has recruited and trained four postdoctoral fellows per year in cancer signaling
through a curriculum of mentored laboratory research, seminars, symposia, coursework and professional
development sessions. The T32 is the only cancer signaling program in the Chicagoland area and has trained
more than sixty postdoctoral fellows, and has helped them to develop highly successful careers in academia and
industry. The Program is led by Drs. Platanias and Peter, both of whom have extensive mentoring expertise and
a well-documented commitment to postdoctoral training. With strong Institutional support, the T32 unites a team
of well-established senior and mid-career investigators and junior faculty, all of whom have robust national
funding to conduct research related to signaling and cancer using rigorous scientific principles and complete
transparency. The specific aims of the T32 renewal are 1) to recruit outstanding postdoctoral fellows, and expand
efforts to increase diversity of the program; 2) to provide postdoctoral fellows a curriculum that develops and
strengthens their research skills and enables them to become proficient in the field of signal transduction and
cancer; 3) to augment research with sessions on grant writing, publications and presentation and training in
computational skills and rigor and reproducibility; 4) to offer a full complement of professional development
activities; and 5) to help trainees achieve successful short and long term outcomes as measured by publications,
extramural grants and attainment of career objectives. In response to Program focus groups and surveys and
with input from the External Advisory Board, we have enhanced our Program curriculum with the following new
elements: a Signaling and Cancer Course, mandatory grant writing and mentor training for trainees. In addition,
preceptors will be trained in mentoring practices that promote the development of trainees from all backgrounds.
Altogether, graduates from this highly impactful Training Program will continue to emerge as the next generation
of cancer scientists, advancing translational research and improving the outcome of patients with cancer."
10873149,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) for object classification have been argued to provide the most promising state-
of-the-art models of the visual system, accompanied by claims that they have attained or even surpassed
human-level performance. However, mounting evidence has revealed that DNNs fail catastrophically when
faced with more noisy or degraded viewing conditions. By contrast, the human visual system is far more
robust. To better understand and model human vision, one must determine whether the brittle nature of DNN
performance arises from flaws in their architectural design, imperfections in their learning protocols, or
inadequate sampling of relevant training experiences. This project will investigate the neurocomputational
bases of robust object recognition, focusing on challenge conditions of visual noise and blur, to develop new
DNN models that can provide a better account of human behavioral and neural responses to object images
that will vary from clear to severely degraded. Both feedforward and recurrent DNN architectures will be
evaluated, and the critical sets of training experiences needed for DNNs to attain robustness will be
determined. In Aim 1, we will evaluate what types of DNNs can adequately predict human behavioral and
neural responses to objects embedded in noise on an image-by-image basis. Correspondences between fMRI
responses at multiple levels of the human visual pathway will be compared with layer-wise DNN
representations to evaluate the goodness of fit for DNN model predictions. In Aim 2, we will determine what
types of DNNs can better account for human behavioral and neural responses to blurry object images. We will
further explore how training with blurry images modifies the visual representations learned by DNNs, leading to
greater robustness to other types of image degradation and greater sensitivity to shape information. In Aim 3,
we will investigate whether perceptual training with noisy or blurry objects can allow humans to acquire even
greater robustness. We will then determine whether human improvements in behavioral and neural
performance can be effectively modeled by DNNs that undergo comparable regimens in visual training. As a
whole, this project will lead to the development of powerful new DNN models that provide a better account of
human behavioral and neural responses across a wide range of challenging viewing conditions. By developing
a better neurocomputational model of the intact human visual system, we will be better positioned to eventually
develop models of central visual disorders, which can arise from neurodevelopmental or neurological
disorders, stroke, head injury, brain tumors or other diseases. The advancement of more robust, human-like
DNNs is also highly relevant to AI applications in computer vision and medical image processing."
10871890,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is comprised mainly of Crohn’s Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC), and is
characterized by a chronic non-resolving inflammatory response in the intestinal mucosa. Although the exact etiology is
unknown, dysbiosis, genetic, environmental, and immunologic factors are all thought to play roles in this multifactorial
disease. There are no cures, and in most cases, lifelong treatment is required. Current first line standards of care may
benefit 50% of patients, with non-responders being prescribed more aggressive corticosteroid and immunomodulatory
therapies that include many different classes of biologics. Although biologics like mAbs targeting TNF, IL-12/23, and
vedolizumab (which targets the gut homing receptor integrin α4β7) have been a welcome addition in the treatment of
IBDs, they present unique issues. With respect to vedolizumab, this includes subsets of patients that lack a response to
treatment, cost, and high rates of secondary loss of response. There is a clear need for new approaches to treat IBD
patients that offer better long-term prognosis and improved risk-benefit profiles. Vedolizumab selectively targets integrin
α4β7 and is currently indicated for use in patients with moderate to severe CD or UC who have not responded to current
first and second line treatments. However, not all patients respond and secondary loss of response to vedolizumab can be
as high as 39% in UC patients. A mechanism that could explain this is the upregulation of compensatory cell trafficking
molecules, like the integrin α4β1, allowing recruitment of inflammatory cells into the gut. The dual α4β1 and α4β7
antagonist natalizumab could address this from an efficacy standpoint, however, despite being approved for Crohn’s
disease, the significant safety concerns around progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) preclude its use in this
patient population. Development of an effective dual α4β1 and α4β7 antagonist, that is not biologic in nature but rather a
small molecule drug administered orally once-a-day and devoid of the safety concerns surrounding PML, would be
transformative in the treatment of IBD. This is the goal of the Phase I STTR program proposed here.
 Phase I studies have identified a potential lead candidate antagonist of integrins α4β7 and α4β1 that is effective in
a T cell transfer model of colitis but does not induce hematopoietic stem cell mobilization or B cell lymphocytosis, which
are linked to the development of PML with natalizumab treatment. The lead class of compounds are orally available, with
pharmacokinetic parameters indicative of once-a-day dosing. In this phase II proposal, we will perform IND-enabling
studies, including safety pharmacology, ADME, toxicology/toxicokinetics, and biomarker development that will lead to
eventual clinical candidate selection and submission of an IND for testing in IBD patients."
10813742,"SUMMARY
Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) create significant healthcare and economic burdens as they are responsible for
more than one billion infections worldwide each year resulting in more than 1.5 million deaths. Hospital patients
who acquire nosocomial IFIs experience longer hospital stays, increased morbidity, and higher mortality rates.
Only a few classes of antifungal drugs are available, and the emergence of resistance within all classes is an
alarming threat to global public health. Of particular concern are infections caused by Candida, Aspergillus,
Cryptococcus, and Pneumocystis species due the level of resistance seen with these pathogens and the
associated mortality rates. New classes of anti-fungals are desperately needed, particularly with the emergence
of multidrug resistant strains. To address this need, Curatix is developing a new class of anti-fungals that
disrupt an essential metabolic pathway and first step in coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis - the
phosphorylation of vitamin B5 by pantothenate kinase (PanK). Genetic and pharmacological studies
demonstrated that in fungi, this step is essential for cell viability, thus validating fungal PanKs as excellent targets
for the development of new classes of antifungal drugs. To achieve this goal, we conducted high-throughput
screen of ~156,593 compounds to search for inhibitors of A. fumigatus AfPanK and identified three 1st generation
compounds within a single chemotype with Ki values ranging between 190 and 360 nM. Screening and
preliminary medicinal chemistry optimization of 86 analogs identified four 2nd generation compounds with
improved activity against AfPanK as well as S. cerevisiae PanK (Cab1) with Ki values ranging between 12 and
170 nM for Cab1 and 50 and 217 nM for AfPanK. The compounds showed no cytotoxicity against five human
cell lines, very high selectivity for fungal PanKs over human PanKs (EC50 >10 µM), and significant biological
activity in vitro against C. albicans, C. parapsilosis and C. glabrata. We further solved the crystal structure of
Cab1 as an apo-enzyme and in complex with these inhibitors. This Phase I program will build upon these
significant data with the goal to evaluate the biological activity of these lead compounds in vivo and
initiate an SAR to improve their antifungal potency (>10 fold). In Aim 1 we will characterize the in vivo
efficacy of these compounds in animal models of candidiasis and aspergillosis. In Aim 2, we will build upon the
biological, biochemical and structural data to generate a library of analogs in order to identify compounds with
more potent activity against multiple fungal pathogens. Successful completion of the Phase I program will provide
the critical data needed to support a Phase II program focused on the efficacy of the lead compounds in various
models of fungal infections alone or in combination with other known antifungals. Clinical use of a PanK inhibitor
has the potential to provide a more effective therapeutic option for treating IFIs, both as monotherapy and in
combination with existing drugs, thus greatly decreasing the economic and healthcare burdens associated with
these infections and improving patient outcomes."
10900811,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Liver ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) is an unavoidable consequence of major liver resection and liver
transplantation that leads to significant morbidity, mortality, and costs after liver surgery. However, previous
strategies to protect the liver from I/R injury have focused on one specific known injury mechanisms, leaving
intact other detrimental processes. Pre/post-operative exercise facilitates recovery after major abdominal
surgery. It is known that exercise confers beneficial effects on the surgical outcome by regulating multiple
mechanisms, including alteration of quantity and function of innate immune cells to provide an anti-
inflammatory environment. Our novel preliminary data indicate that preoperative exercise therapy (PET)
significantly reduced serum aminotransferase levels (liver damage) and expression of cytokines and
chemokines (inflammatory responses) during liver I/R. Our single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data
revealed PET altered the transcriptomic profile of resident Kupffer cells (KCs) towards an anti-inflammatory
profile. PET also promoted the anti-inflammatory trained immunity in Kupffer cells which is associated with
increased circulating damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) IL-33 and itaconate metabolic
reprogramming. Furthermore, we show that PET significantly decreased the number of neutrophils and
formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), as key mediators of local and systemic injury after liver I/R.
Given these findings, we hypothesize that PET prevents liver I/R injury by altering the trained immunity
in Kupffer cells, and the NET-induced local and systemic inflammatory response. We will test our
hypothesis by pursuing two specific aims. In Aim 1, we will determine the mechanism by which PET protects
the liver from I/R injury via training Kupffer cells towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype. We will test the
hypothesis that PET induces an anti-inflammatory trained immunity in KCs via modulation of IL-33/ST2/STAT3
signaling pathway and itaconate/IRG1 metabolic reprogramming pathway. In Aim 2, we will define the role of
PET in attenuating local and systemic injury during liver I/R via reduction of neutrophil extracellular traps. We
will test the hypothesis that PET ameliorates systemic inflammatory injury after liver I/R through suppression of
neutrophil recruitment and formation of NETs. Our proposal will delineate the molecular mechanisms of PET in
the regulation of hepatic immune microenvironment, and systemic immunity during liver I/R. The mechanisms
discovered in these studies will provide the foundation for not only optimizing this non-pharmacological-based
strategy against surgery-induced organ injury but also devising exercise-mimicking pharmacological strategies
for patients undergoing surgery who are exercise intolerant."

10895333,"Abstract
The Program Project will employ in all projects novel engineered reagents that enable manipulation and
interrogation of individual signaling pathways with precise spatial and temporal control. As described in individual
Projects, reagents provided by Core B will be used to define the signaling processes that regulate plasticity and
specialization of macrophages and define their role during lung inflammation and injury as well as resolution.
Development and optimization of these tools will require the efforts of the Synthetic Biology and Optogenetics
Core B. The central functions of Core B will be 1) to develop molecular tools customized for each specific
question in individual Projects, 2) to evaluate the new reagents as they come on-line and establish protocols for
their application in macrophages and in in vivo mouse model, and 3) to provide assistance to all Projects with
the application of the tools, troubleshooting, and analysis of the results. The intent will be to simplify application
of these advances technologies to dissect specific signaling pathways in the Program Project and allow
participants to focus on the proposed questions requiring these reagents. The specific tools that will be developed
and employed by Core B include: 1) new reagents to control localization and interactions of proteins identified
by Projects; and 2) reagents for regulation of activity of selected proteins in living macrophages, and targeted
activation of these proteins in specific complexes and subcellular locations. Core B will also generate and
optimize reagents for expression of engineered proteins in macrophages and develop new reagents as needed
for manipulation and interrogation of protein interactions and cell signaling. The tools developed will enable
manipulation of individual signaling pathways, deconstruction of these pathways, and assessment of their roles
in the regulating function of macrophages in lungs."
10909993,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Drug-coated balloons (DCBs) have evolved as a promising interventional strategy for peripheral arterial
disease (PAD). While paclitaxel (PTX)-based DCBs were emerging as the interventional standard of care for
many PAD lesions, a recent meta-analysis of randomized trials suggested excess late mortality in PTX-treated
patients. This result prompted the FDA to issue a warning that ultimately led to a marked reduction of the
clinical use of DCBs. This response by the clinical and regulatory communities underscores a need to develop
next-generation DCBs that could show improved efficacy and safety profiles. Drawing from our previous
experience related to studies on drug-eluting stents and more recently on DCBs, we propose two hypothesis-
driven design strategies to enhance DCB performance and safety. Aims I and II will consider balloon surface
hydrophilicity and coating composition, respectively, as critical DCB design variables, and seek to identify
mechanistic relations between these design variables, coating microstructure, drug delivery efficacy, as well as
local and systemic toxicity. We will predict optimal DCB designs for both acute and sustained drug delivery
using a biophysical contact model that computes deterministic interfacial mechanical interactions during DCB
deployment. Our material design space includes two excipients (urea and shellac) and two drugs (PTX and
dexamethasone (DEX)), with consideration of variable excipient-drug ratios and novel balloon pre-treatment
protocols prior to coating applications. We will use an in vivo model of rabbit atherosclerosis to evaluate
optimized DCBs, providing support for our approach to enhance PTX delivery and insight into the clinical
potential of DEX as an alternate DCB payload."
10908447,"Abstract: While generation of sperm and eggs through meiosis is exquisitely coordinated and tightly regulated,
chromosome segregation is remarkably error prone. In humans it is estimated that ~5% of sperm and ~30% of
oocytes have the wrong chromosome complement - known as aneuploidy. As such, errors in meiotic
chromosome segregation are a leading cause of mental disability, miscarriage, and infertility. In mammals,
critical steps that ensure faithful chromosome segregation include generation of programmed DNA double-
stranded breaks (DSBs) at PRDM9 hotspots that are enriched for dual Histone H3 lysine 4 and lysine 36
trimethylation (K4/H3K36me3), the pairing of parental chromosomes (homologs), the co-alignment of homologs
lengthwise, and the tethering of homologs by crossing over – the exchange of chromosome arms between
homologs. Despite this wealth in knowledge, a key gap in knowledge in this process is how PRDM9-dependent
dual H3K4/H3K36me3 modifications influence homolog pairing and recombination. We and others have shown
that ZCWPW1, a dual histone methylation reader, is enriched at PRDM9 target sites, has no effect on the number
or location of DSBs, but may be important for DSB repair. More specifically, our preliminary data suggest that
ZCWPW1 may be required for efficient homolog pairing which when compromised culminates in chromosome
entanglements, DSB repair defects, and ultimately chromosome mis-segregation and infertility. Therefore, we
propose a comprehensive and integrative analysis using genetic, genomic, molecular, and biochemical
approaches to dissect the role of ZCWPW1 in homolog pairing and recombination. Overall, these studies will
provide fundamental knowledge about meiotic chromosome dynamics and a mechanistic understanding of the
role of ZCWPW1 in mammalian meiosis."
10821385,"Screening for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) during well-child pediatric check-ups reduces the age of
diagnosis, allowing more time for critical early intervention. Furthermore, universal screening mitigates
disparities in the age of diagnosis for minorities, and has been demonstrated to be feasible in community-
based primary care settings. However, limited follow-up of toddlers who screened negative is a notable gap in
the literature that contributed to the United States Preventive Services Task Force’s (USPSTF) determination
of insufficient evidence to recommend universal ASD screening at present. Follow-up of children who are not
identified at risk is cost- and labor-intensive, but is critical to determine the sensitivity of toddler ASD screening.
This study will be among the first to use rigorous prospective detection strategies in a large, low-risk sample
that previously had concurrent detection. The goal of the proposed study is to find missed cases by
rescreening children who were not identified with ASD during the course of three prior screening studies that
administered the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers, Revised, with Follow-Up during toddler well child
visits. This includes those who screened negative as toddlers, as well as children who screened positive but
either were lost to follow-up or were evaluated and not diagnosed with ASD. The specific aims are to measure
prospective sensitivity using rigorous case confirmation for potential missed cases. We will identify patterns in
toddler screening outcomes for these missed cases; we predict that children whose first screen was younger
and those who did not complete multiple screens are more likely to be missed cases compared to those
screened at older toddler visits and rescreened by age three. Finally, we will examine whether missed cases
are more likely to have milder ASD symptoms, greater likelihood of psychiatric comorbidities, and be female
compared to children who demonstrated risk as toddlers but were not diagnosed with ASD until they were
older. Although these characteristics have been hypothesized, rigorous evidence is lacking to demonstrate
differences between children with ASD missed by toddler screening. The majority of the multi-site sample (total
n = 8,751) screened negative at one or more pediatric visits between 1 and 3 years old (n = 8,091). In addition,
we will rescreen children who screened positive but did not attend the evaluation (n = 426), which often signals
lack of parent concern, and children evaluated and classified as nonASD (n = 234), who may have developed
clinically significant ASD symptoms as they aged. Parents will be invited to enroll and rescreen their child, now
7-14 years old, using a secure web-based portal. All at risk children, and a random sample of low-risk cases,
will be invited for a comprehensive, research-reliable evaluation; final ASD outcomes will be used to calculate
prospective sensitivity, which will be compared to literature reporting sensitivity based on record review
strategies. Results of this proposed study will directly address a gap identified by the USPSTF, and will
address the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee’s Question 1 about early detection of ASD."
10825435,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
 This application is a proposal to train a predoctoral student with a passion for studying nutritional
regulation of metabolic disease. I will conduct research in the laboratory of Dr. R. Mirmira at the University of
Chicago and will engage in career development activities to foster my aim to lead an academic research
program as a principal investigator. Career development activities will include formal training in the art of
scientific writing, opportunities for presentation at regional and national meetings, and writing opportunities that
include manuscripts for publication. The majority of time will be spent in primary research at the bench
involving studies related to diabetes, an increasingly prevalent threat to public health in the United States. The
research program will focus on the biology of the islet β cell, which is known to be defective in virtually all forms
of diabetes. Understanding the stimuli and mechanisms of endogenous β cell mass expansion has powerful
therapeutic potential, and the proposal will study a rare and unusual modification known as hypusination.
Deoxyhypusine synthase (DHPS) catalyzes the formation of the rare amino acid hypusine on eIF5A, activating
its known function as a translation factor. DHPS deficiency in the β cell results in mice that exhibit impaired β
cell adaptive proliferation, emphasizing the role for this unusual modification in normal β cell responses.
However, deletion of DHPS in this model also increases the prevalence of un-hypusinated eIF5A (eIF5ALys),
and it remains unknown if the phenotype observed might emanate from the presence of this form as opposed
to the absence of the hypusinated form of the factor (eIF5AHyp). My preliminary data indicate an interaction
between eIF5ALys and the kinase Gcn2, which phosphorylates and inhibits the translation factor eIF2-α during
amino acid scarcity. Association between Gcn2 and eIF5ALys suggests a possible role in negative translation
regulation and nutrient homeostasis for this uncharacterized isoform. I hypothesize that eIF5ALys functions as
a negative regulator of mRNA translation and its accumulation in the islet β cell suppresses adaptive β cell
proliferation. To investigate this hypothesis, I will achieve the following two specific aims: (1) Investigate the
metabolic effects of eIF5ALys accumulation in β cells in vivo, and (2) Define the molecular mechanisms
governing eIF5ALys regulation of protein translation in β cells. This proposal will target a gap of knowledge in
the literature regarding the unmodified form of eIF5A and elaborate on the therapeutic potential of modulating
the hypusination for β cell proliferation in diabetes. Completing these studies will reinforce skills in data
interpretation, research independence, and project management in me as a young investigator so that I can
make future independent and impactful contributions to science."

 Exacerbations of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) lead to roughly 1.5 million ED visits and
700,000 hospitalizations annually. Recovery is slow, and accompanied by high levels of acute care utilization
and mortality. Pulmonary Rehabilitation (PR) is a structured program of exercise and self-management support
that has been shown to relieve dyspnea and improve quality of life. Clinical guidelines recommend PR for
patients with stable COPD and after an exacerbation. Unfortunately, even when referred by physicians, our
research has shown that few patients who might benefit from PR ever begin treatment. The primary goal of this
project is to identify effective strategies for promoting and sustaining participation in PR.
 Peer Support involves pairing a patient with a trained peer from a similar background, and facing similar
health challenges, who has completed PR. There is a growing body of evidence demonstrating the feasibility,
acceptability, and effectiveness of telephonic peer support for chronic disease management. Narrative
interventions, or `Storytelling', are novel approaches for changing attitudes and behaviors of patients that
involve creating and disseminating videos narrated by individuals with lived experience with the same condition
or facing the same treatment. Storytelling interventions have been shown to help patients achieve better blood
pressure control, and storytelling is being studied in a variety of other clinical contexts.
 In the R61 Phase, we will recruit and train a cohort of peer coaches in behavior change techniques, and will
recruit a diverse group of storytellers, capture their narratives on video, and create a library of 6-8 powerful
stories. We will finalize our protocol, trial infrastructure, and pilot our recruitment strategy. During the R33
Phase, we will recruit 305 adults treated for exacerbation of COPD, and randomize them to 1) Enhanced
“Usual Care” (eUC); 2) eUC + Storytelling; or 3) eUC + Peer Support. We will evaluate the effectiveness of
each strategy compared to eUC, and to each other, at promoting participation in PR at 6 months. Using a
mixed-methods approach, we will evaluate intervention acceptability, sustainability, and cost, from the
perspectives of the patients and peer coaches as well as PR program staff and hospital leadership. We will use
these findings to refine the strategies and to disseminate an implementation package that will enable other PR
programs to adopt these approaches.
 This project engages key stakeholders in study conceptualization, execution, and dissemination, and is
responsive to the NHLBI/CDC COPD National Action Plan that calls for the development of strategies to
increase the number of Americans that benefit from PR."
10861771,"Project Summary
Viral pathogens are an enduring threat to global public health. This project aims to use viral genomic data
to improve understanding of ongoing virus evolution and to make actionable inferences to reduce the global
burden of viral infectious disease. In order to be relevant for public health interventions, analyses of viral
sequence data need to be incredibly rapid, both in terms of computation and in terms of dissemination. To
accomplish these goals, this project will create novel methodological tools to analyze evolutionary dynamics
from inﬂuenza genetic sequence data and to analyze transmission patterns from outbreak sequence data.
Over the current project period (2016-2021), we developed a real-time analysis platform called Nextstrain,
which provides up-to-date analyses for a variety of pathogens including inﬂuenza virus, Ebola virus, Zika
virus, dengue virus, mumps virus, tuberculosis and SARS-CoV-2. Bioinformatic pipelines developed through
Nextstrain are reusable by academic groups and public health labs and resulting analyses are shareable via the
website nextstrain.org.
In the upcoming project period (2021-2026), we will reﬁne methods for forecasting strain dynamics of inﬂuenza
virus. Monitoring and forecasting evolution of viral strains is of paramount importance. New antigenic variants
of inﬂuenza that partially escape from prior human immunity emerge and rapidly sweep through the viral
population. Such strains are less susceptible to vaccine-derived immunity and so antigenic evolution results in
the need to frequently update the seasonal inﬂuenza vaccine. This project aims to reﬁne methods to forecast
strain dynamics and predict the makeup of the future inﬂuenza population. This forecasting is especially
relevant to inﬂuenza vaccine strain selection, as a vaccine strain is chosen for the Northern Hemisphere in
February for deployment the following winter. Accurate projections will aid in vaccine match for seasonal
inﬂuenza viruses and result in improved vaccine efﬁcacy. Technical innovations focus on extending models to
work across different viruses, different gene segments and to incorporate spatial dynamics.
In an outbreak scenario such as the West African Ebola epidemic, the American Zika epidemic or the SARS-
CoV-2 pandemic, the focus of public health interventions focus on early diagnosis, contact tracing, isolation and
treatment. Epidemiological understanding of transmission dynamics is of paramount importance to outbreak
response. Viral genomic data can reveal otherwise hidden transmission patterns and aid in efﬁcient contact
tracing. Geographic spread is especially amenable to genomic inferences. This project will develop tools to
make epidemiological inferences from outbreak sequence data. These methods will continue to be deployed
via the Nextstrain platform, allowing epidemiologists throughout the world to analyze their own datasets.
Genomic epidemiology has the potential to truly inform outbreak response. Nextstrain has been instrumental
to SARS-CoV-2 genomic epidemiology in the United States and world. Improvements to the accuracy and
capabilities of the platform would be well placed."

Channing Division of Network Medicine Training Program in Systems Approaches to the Epidemiology,
Genetics, and Genomics of Lung Diseases
This training program is a competing continuation of a program funded by Institutional Ruth L. Kirschstein
National Research Service Award T32 HL007427. The program, which has operated continuously for the past 46
years, focuses on chronic respiratory diseases that are major public health problems--asthma and chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Based on our current limited understanding of these complex lung
diseases, there is a critical need for individuals trained in the application of systems approaches to epidemiology,
genetics, and genomics to perform quantitative research in respiratory biology. This T32 program is instrumental
in meeting this need, successfully training independent research investigators who go on to lead their own
research programs across the U.S. and Canada. The program provides research training in seven areas:
systems genetics; systems biology and network modeling; transcriptomics; functional genetics; other Omics;
epigenomics; and bioinformatics/data science. Six postdoctoral and two predoctoral training positions are
requested in this proposal, with a typical appointment duration of three years. The trainees interact with a pool of
36 faculty members in the seven interrelated research areas. Each trainee will have the opportunity to become
involved in the design, execution, and analysis of ongoing federally funded research projects as well as develop
an independent career path. Trainees’ research is conducted at the Channing Division of Network Medicine, a
research division of the Department of Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) and Harvard Medical
School (HMS). Predoctoral trainees work toward a Ph.D. in network science, biostatistics, or epidemiology.
Postdoctoral trainees undertake didactic classroom work leading to a Master of Science (M.S.) in epidemiology
or a Master of Public Health (M.P.H.) degree at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH) or a
Master of Medical Science (M.M.Sc.) degree in bioinformatics at HMS. After completing our program, trainees
will be eligible to assume faculty positions in systems biology/biostatistics or genetics/genomics. Trainees benefit
from a close relationship with the HSPH Department of Biostatistics and the BWH Division of Pulmonary and
Critical Care Medicine. More than 85% of our postdoctoral trainee graduates in the past 12 years are active in
research, and 68% of them have obtained an NIH K-series grant or similar mentored award."

10894784,"PROJECT SUMMARY
To ensure that emerging technologies grow without causing illness or injury to workers and the
public, a professional workforce must be prepared with the ability to anticipate, recognize, evaluate,
and control exposures to hazardous materials in emerging technology workplaces. Therefore, the
University of Minnesota, the University of Iowa, and University of Utah have formed the
Interdisciplinary Training, Education and Research Activities for Assessing And Controlling
Contaminants From Emerging Technologies (INTERACCT) Program. The objectives of the
INTERACCT Program for this funding period are (i) to develop a comprehensive web-based
curriculum on occupational hygiene, with emphasis on applications to worker health and safety in
emerging technologies. To accomplish this objective, we will develop three online core courses for
education and training in chemical hazard recognition, exposure assessment, and risk assessment.
In the cores, we will demonstrate concepts with examples and illustrations drawn from the following

10843781,"Abstract
Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a retinal disease characterized by aberrant vascular and neural development
that affects prematurely born infants receiving supplemental oxygen therapy. Advances in neonatal care enable
physicians to save the lives of increasingly premature infants. However, these infants are at great risk for
developing ROP because the high oxygen levels in neonatal incubators suppress retinal vascular development.
When returned to room air, there is a compensatory pathological neovascularization that results in retinopathy.
Retinal ganglion cell opsins, melanopsin (OPN4) and neuropsin (OPN5), regulate vascular development in the
perinatal period of mice. OPN4 is a blue light-sensitive opsin, while OPN5 is maximally sensitive to visible violet
light. An OPN4-dependent light response pathway has been shown to regulate vascular development in the eye
by keeping VEGFA levels in check (OPN4-VEGFA pathway) (Rao et al., Nature 2013; 494:243-6). OPN5 also
regulates vascular development in the eye. Opn5 null mice show mildly elevated retinal vascular density and
neuron number, and promiscuous hyaloid vessel retraction (Nguyen et al., Nature Cell Biol 2019; 21:420-429).
OPN5 modulates vascular development via dopamine-regulated VEGFR2 expression (OPN5-dopamine-
VEGFR2 pathway). The proposed research will test the hypothesis that stimulation of the OPN4-VEGFA blue
light response pathway will protect retinal vascular development in an oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR)
mouse model of ROP, while stimulation of the OPN5-dopamine-VEGFR2 violet light pathway will
exacerbate retinopathy. To test of this innovative hypothesis, we propose two specific aims using the mouse
OIR model. In aim 1, we will explore the role of OPN4 manipulation, examining the effects of removing
environmental blue light or enhancing blue light on the severity of retinopathy, using both wildtype and Opn4
mutant mice. In aim 2, we will explore the role of OPN5 manipulation, examining the effects of removing
environmental violet light or enhancing violet light on the severity of retinopathy, using both wildtype and Opn5
mutant mice. Effects of blue light or violet light therapy will be assessed during oxygen treatment (P7-12) and in
the ensuing developmental period (P17-P50). Our findings will have broad implications for prenatal and neonatal
eye care, and may lead to the development of an innovative, non-invasive, light-based preventative treatment
for ROP."
10887511,"The mammalian transcriptome integrates diverse extracellular and intracellular signals and controls numerous
critical cell functions. Furthermore, the ability to flexibly control endogenous gene expression in response to
external and internal signals will lead to breakthrough cell therapies with enhanced safety and efficacy. However,
we lack tools that can reversibly and effectively modulate the transcriptome. Genome editing tools, RNA inter-
ference, and programmable transcription factors are powerful genetic engineering tools. However, they all have
some deficiencies, either they permanently disrupt the gene of interest, which prevents investigation of the dy-
namic impact of the gene, or they lack specificity and activity. Therefore, novel tools are urgently needed to
advance our ability to reprogram the mammalian transcriptome.
Recently, a new class of RNA-guided RNA nuclease, Cas13, has been discovered. Some Cas13 orthologs,
such as Cas13d and Cas13b, have been shown to have higher and more specific RNA degradation activity than
RNAi in mammalian cells. Cas13 is also not affected by the chromatin structure, a challenge commonly encoun-
tered by programmable transcription factors for transcriptome engineering. It also doesn't have the collateral
cleavage activity in mammalian cells that other Cas13 has. Therefore, Cas13 has the potential to be the best
tool for mammalian transcriptome engineering.
Similar to other genome engineering tools, the full potential of Cas13 can only be realized if regulatory mecha-
nisms and genetic circuits have been incorporated that afford facile and intelligent control. Currently, there are
no tools specifically designed to regulate Cas13 activity. Therefore, the objective of this proposed work is to
develop a set of groundbreaking tools with Cas13 that can inducibly and reversibly modulate the mammalian
transcriptome in response to exogenous small molecules (and FDA approved drugs) or biological cues. Also, to
showcase their clinical potential, we will leverage our engineered Cas13 to improve the safety of chimeric antigen
receptor (CAR) T cell therapy. CAR T cell therapies have shown tremendous promise and efficacy against vari-
ous cancers, but they can also lead to cytokine release syndrome (CRS), a dangerous adverse side effect. The
factors produced by CAR T cells lead to CRS are also necessary for the function of the therapy. Therefore,
inducible and tunable control of these critical factors, as opposed to knockout, are required to develop safe and
effective CAR T cell therapy. We will achieve our objectives through the following aims:
Aim 1: Develop a collection of split inducible Cas13
Aim 2: Establish cell-autonomous control of Cas13 in response to biological signals
Aim 3: Modulate cytokine production in CAR T cells to combat CRS
Success from this work will have a transformative impact on cell therapy development."
10900573,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Determining how neurons are assembled into functional circuits will provide insight into developmental
disorders of the nervous system and may suggest therapeutic approaches to promote nerve regeneration. To
navigate to their correct targets, axons must modulate their responses to extracellular cues, and regulated
intracellular protein trafficking plays a pivotal role in this process. For example, commissural axons cross the
midline despite the presence of repellant ligands in order to establish connections that are essential for
coordinated motor behavior. In Drosophila, the endosomal protein Commissureless (Comm) prevents
commissural axons from prematurely responding to the repellant Slit, by inhibiting surface expression of the
Slit receptor Roundabout1 (Robo1). In mammals, Robo receptors are also negatively regulated in commissural
axons prior to midline crossing, but the mechanisms are unknown. Unlike Slit and Robo, comm is not
conserved in vertebrates; however, our preliminary data indicate that the vertebrate Nedd-4 interacting proteins
(Ndfip1 and Ndfip2) can act analogously to Comm to regulate the trafficking and stability of human Robo
receptors in vitro, and that loss of Ndfip1or Ndfip2 function in vivo in mice results in increased expression of
Robo receptors and defects in axon guidance. We will test the hypothesis that Ndfip proteins control axon
guidance in the developing brain and spinal cord by recruiting Robo receptors to endosomes and triggering
their degradation through interactions with Nedd-4 E3 ubiquitin ligases. In aim 1, we will use molecular, cell
biological and biochemical approaches to: 1) determine whether Ndfip proteins exhibit differential effects on
intracellular trafficking of Robo receptors or other axon guidance receptors, 2) delimit the sequences that are
necessary and sufficient to mediate interactions between Ndfip proteins and Robo family receptors, 3)
characterize the role of HECT E3 ligase activity on receptor trafficking and 4) identify the specific Nedd4 family
ligase(s) that is required for Robo receptor regulation. Aim 2 will explore the embryonic expression patterns
and in vivo requirements for Ndfip proteins during commissural axon guidance by examining the trajectory of
commissural axons in Ndfip1 and Ndfip2 single and double mutants, using 1) immunofluorescence for pre and
post-crossing commissural axon markers, and 2) unilateral lipophilic dye tracing experiments. In addition, we
will generate conditional knockouts of Ndfip1, Nedd4-1 and Nedd4-2 using Cre-lines specific for commissural
neurons to investigate requirements for Nedd4-1 and Nedd4-2 in spinal commissural axon guidance. Aim 3 will
assess the in vivo links between Ndfip proteins and Robo receptors by 1) testing whether neurons cultured
from Ndfip mutants exhibit altered repulsive responses to exogenously added Slit proteins and 2) examining
genetic interactions between Ndfip and Robo mutants. Finally, a biochemical screen will be conducted to
identify novel substrates of Ndfip proteins."
10927366,"Project Summary/Abstract:
In the first year after birth, human sensitivity develops markedly to the fundamental features on which all higher-
level vision depends: contrast, spatial scale, edge orientations, chromatic content. It is well known that this
development is highly dependent on visual experience because disruptions in experience have significant and,
in some cases, permanent consequences for vision from sensation to cognition. The field does not have,
however, an empirical characterization of the low-level feature statistics of typical infant visual experience. This
gap is critical because emerging studies of higher-level content indicate these statistical properties change with
development and are dependent on the infant’s own changing internal visual biases and behaviors (eye
movements, head movements, other body movements). These factors play a direct role in selecting and
organizing the spatial structure of images projected to the eye. This project will collect and analyze the first-
person visual experiences of 200 infants (50 each) at 2-3, 5-6, 8-9, and 11-12 months of age, plus a sample of
20 infants tested at all of those ages. The core hypothesis is that the statistics change systematically in a
developmentally consistent sequence in the everyday lives of infants. The experiences are collected by infant
head cameras worn for hours in the home and precision measures of eye and head movements in the laboratory.
Analyses will quantify the spatial organization of fundamental low-level features in the collected images as a
function of age, posture, activity, and specific contents. The project will also characterize the influence of
refractive error and front-end visual immaturities on the images. The research will determine how infants’
behaviors influence the spatial organization of visual features in the input by analyzing the motion patterns in the
at-home head-camera images and through direct measures of eye and head motion patterns in the laboratory.
The research will provide the first characterization of the natural visual statistics of infant experience in the first
year after birth and is expected to reveal specific developmental risk-points in those expected visual statistics."
10873826,"Mutations in human WNK (With No Lysine) kinases are associated with hyperkalemia, hypertension and chronic
kidney disease. However, despite extensive characterization of (patho)physiological roles of WNKs in the kidney
and extrarenal tissues, there is surprisingly little understanding of how WNKs themselves are regulated. WNKs
regulate epithelial ion transport in the mammalian kidney. The applicants’ long-term goal is to achieve
mechanistic understanding of epithelial ion transport mechanisms relevant to human kidney function. Chloride
ion is known to regulate WNKs. The overall objective of this application is to define and understand new
mechanisms of WNK regulation. This renewal application builds on three significant advances from the currently
funded grant. First, potassium inhibits Drosophila and mammalian WNKs through chloride-independent
mechanisms. Second, the scaffold protein Mo25 (Mouse protein 25/Cab39) is an important regulator of WNK
signaling, and activates WNKs independent of its known effects on SPAK (Ste20-related proline alanine rich
kinase) and OSR1 (oxidative stress response) kinases. Third, potassium and Mo25 have differential effects on
the kidney-expressed mammalian WNKs 1, 3 and 4. The central hypothesis is that potassium and Mo25 directly
regulate WNK kinase activity, with differential effects on mammalian WNK isoforms. Guided by strong preliminary
data, the central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Determine the mechanism and
physiological consequences of WNK regulation by potassium; 2) Elucidate novel mechanisms of Mo25 regulation
of WNK signaling; and 3) Determine the molecular basis for differential WNK isoform regulation by potassium
and Mo25. The approach is innovative by leveraging insights from biophysical and structural studies to determine
molecular mechanisms of epithelial ion transport regulation, using a unique platform, the Drosophila Malpighian
tubule, that has powerful molecular genetic tools and tractable physiologic readouts. Assays have been
established, and demonstrated feasible in the investigators’ hands, to: 1) identify WNK potassium binding sites,
generate potassium-insensitive WNK mutants, and test their effects on transepithelial ion transport; 2) determine
how Mo25 regulates WNK activity in vitro and in the tubule, and probe the interactions between Mo25, potassium
and chloride in WNK regulation; and 3) test differences in potassium and Mo25 regulation of WNKs 1, 3 and 4.
Successful completion of the proposed studies will elucidate the most comprehensive mechanistic understanding
of WNK regulation achieved to date. This is significant, because delineation of the importance of these WNK
regulatory mechanisms in various (patho)physiological contexts, together with the molecular insights gained from
the studies proposed here, will allow the development of targeted approaches to therapeutically modulate WNK
signaling. This has translational impact in a broad range of conditions, including the treatment of dyskalemias,
salt-sensitive hypertension, cardio- and cerebrovascular disease, and kidney disease."

10920370,"Background: There remains tremendous controversy surrounding the pros and cons of contact precautions
for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The rationale for this application is that more
knowledge is needed to identify which patients need to be placed on transmission-based contact precautions
(gloves and gowns used by healthcare workers); and when and which patients may not require contact
precautions to prevent the spread of MRSA.
Significance and Impact: Antibiotic resistance is one of the biggest public health challenges of our time. The
application is significant in that it recognizes and addresses the barrier to institutionalizing contact precautions
for all patients with MRSA when busy healthcare personnel (HCP) feel that they may not have time to
continuously don and doff gowns and gloves as they transition from one room to another. If the study results
provide guidance on when contact precautions are most necessary (and when they are not), it may be safe to
recommend reducing the number of times when gowns and gloves are used unnecessarily, while also
providing new evidence on when contact precautions remain essential.
Innovation: The work is innovative in that we are aiming for precision public health to be brought into the field
of antibiotic resistance and all VA medical centers (VAMCs) in the country: the right type of precautions, for
the right type of encounter at the right time.
Specific Aims: Aim 1: Perform a multi-site, geographically diverse cohort study at VA facilities and enroll
patients with MRSA to determine the rate of MRSA transmission to healthcare personnel gloves and gowns in
the ICU and non-ICU setting. Aim 2: Determine which patient risk factors, including comorbid conditions and
severity of illness markers, which patient care interactions and which healthcare personnel types are
associated with greater transmission of MRSA. Aim 3: Develop a dynamic transmission model to compare the
cost-effectiveness of different contact precaution strategies.
Methodology: Across six VAMCs, we will enroll 800 patients who have MRSA in the intensive care unit (ICU)
and non-ICU setting. Research coordinators will randomly observe five healthcare personnel-patient
interactions per patient. Research coordinators will gather data on the patient level factors and on healthcare
personnel patient interaction factors. When the healthcare personnel leave the room, research coordinators
will culture the healthcare personnel's gloves and gown upon room exit. Thus, five healthcare personnel glove
and gown cultures per patient will be obtained, leading to 4,000 glove culture outcomes and 4,000 gown
culture outcomes. The cost-effectiveness aim will use the results from aims 1 and 2 to build a dynamic
transmission model to assess the effectiveness of different contact precaution strategies. For each strategy,
costs will include both direct medical and indirect (i.e., productivity losses) costs.
Implementation/next steps: We will publish our findings in appropriate peer-reviewed scientific journals and
present the results at national scientific forums such as the VA HSR&D Conference, the SHEA Spring Meeting
and IDSA’s IDWeek annual meeting. To ensure successful study implementation and appropriate knowledge
dissemination and translation of findings into policy, we have established an interdisciplinary advisory board
and study site co-investigators with years of expertise in VAMCs. The advisory board members are leaders in
infectious disease in the VHA who have developed and guided the VA MRSA Prevention Initiative over the
years and can implement findings into VA policy. As well, Dr. Harris is a former president of the Society of
Healthcare Epidemiology of America and current member of the CDC HICPAC Advisory group. He will use
these connections to help guide SHEA and CDC policies relative to contact precautions. The VA is an ideal
place to perform this study and have it widely implemented due to its agility in making national policies."
10918183,"Most health systems attempt to measure patients' social risk factors, but such data collection is typically fraught
with operational and conceptual difficulties. Multi-domain screening questionnaires face reliability, validity, and
workflow challenges. Area-level data are not valid proxies for individual characteristics. Diagnosis codes are
underutilized. The day-to-day use of natural language processing (NLP) to extract social factors from text is
beyond the capacity of most organizations. Thus, health care organizations need more implementable and valid
approaches to measuring social factors. With implementable and valid approaches, health systems will more
effectively address the negative cost, quality and health outcomes associated with patients' social risk factors.
The objective of this proposal is to assess the validity of patient-level computable social factor phenotypes for
use in predicting patients' risk of increased healthcare costs and utilization. Computable phenotypes are com-
posites of characteristics defined through single data elements or a collection of data elements, observations or
events. Because these phenotypes derive from existing healthcare operations and electronic data systems, they
are well-positioned for widespread implementation. Our central hypothesis is that phenotypes computed from
existing structured demographic, clinical, and business operations data will support equally or more valid infer-
ences about patient social risks than other measurement approaches. Building upon strong preliminary data and
direction from experts in the field, we will determine the validity and usefulness of six novel social factor pheno-
types computed from already collected information within EHRs and health information exchanges (HIE) through
the following aims: Aim 1, Assess the concurrent validity of patient-level computable social factor phenotypes,
compares the concurrent validity of computed phenotypes, multi-domain questionnaires, and NLP against gold
standard measures of social factors in two health systems. Aim 2, Assess the predictive validity of patient-level
computable social factor phenotypes, will assess the validity of computable phenotypes, multi-domain question-
naires, NLP, and combined approaches in predicting costs and utilization. Aim 3, Assess the reliability (bias) of
patient-level computable social factor phenotypes across patient gender, race, ethnicity, and age, assesses the
reproducibility of measurement approaches across underserved populations. We will employ a multi-method
research approach to identify and mitigate potential bias. This project will lead to more valid and implementable
approaches to patient social factor measurement. The proposed research is significant because it directly ad-
dresses the challenges organizations face in addressing patients' social risks and will provide key inputs to
support organizations efforts at achieving a learning health system. This proposal is innovative by advancing the
psychometrics of social factors and identifying novel usages of EHR and HIE data. By working with multiple and
diverse populations, we address the priority populations of socioeconomically disadvantaged, racial minority
populations, and the elderly."
10907751,"ABSTRACT
 The incidence rate of hepatocellular carcinoma in the United States has been increasing in the
past several decades. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease has become the most important risk factor
for hepatocellular carcinoma. About 25 percent of adults in the United Stated have non-alcoholic fatty liver
disease, which includes a spectrum of liver diseases from simple steatosis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis to
fibrosis and cirrhosis. Liver fibrosis has been recognized as the key determinant of the risk of long-term health
outcome for patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, which will soon be the most common indication
for liver transplantation in the United States. Currently there is no effective treatment or prevention strategy
for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. It is an urgently unmet need to identify novel biological and environmental
factors that drive the progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease to the development of
hepatocellular carcinoma and end-stage liver disease that increasingly require liver transplantation, a
significant public health burden in the United States.
 The liver is an organ that is constantly exposed to a wide range of immunomodulators, environmental
toxins, and gut microbial metabolites through the portal vein. To ensure upkeep of immune tolerance to self
and foreign antigens, the liver has a unique immunotolerance mechanism. Heightened immunotolerance or
immune permissive microenvironment may create a setting with compromised immunosurveillance that
promotes the tumor development and growth in the liver. The gut microbiota can produce large quantities of
metabolites such as secondary bile acids that have genotoxic and tumor-promoting effect. The gut dysbiosis
due to obesity and other metabolic diseases, which are underlying conditions for non-alcoholic fatty liver, alters
the metabolism, synthesis, and transport of bile acids, resulting in the change of bile acid pool size and
characteristics. The altered bile acids profile can elicit inflammation and cause liver injury, leading to fibrosis
and cirrhosis, and eventually hepatocellular carcinoma. We propose prospectively enroll at least 1000 patients
with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease with advanced fibrosis assessed by transient elastography at baseline and
once every 6 months. All study participants will be longitudinally followed up for the occurrence
of hepatocellular carcinoma and end-stage liver disease for up to five years. The specific aims are to
determine if immunosuppressive cytokines, altered bile acid profiles, and the gut dysbiosis have significant
impact on the risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma and end-stage liver disease. The findings, if prove
our hypotheses, will provide much needed scientific evidence for the development of effective strategy for
management and surveillance for patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease with a goal to lower
its progression to hepatocellular carcinoma and other end-stage liver disease."
10885960,"The role of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) in regulating pain and inflammation has been well-
established in animal models. In the clinic, sympathetic blockade is often used for managing neuropathic pain
such as CRPS. The efficacy was evidenced by a recent clinical study showing dramatic and promising results
using a catheter approach to provide longer lasting sympathetic blockade than is achieved by injection, in
patients with intractable neuropathic pain. Mechanisms underlying SNS-mediated pain revealed by our group
and our collaborators in the past 20 years include: activity associated SNS sprouting; generation of
spontaneous activity; immune and inflammatory response; clustered firing of sensory neurons. We reported
recently that persistent neuropathic pain is driven by active nerve regeneration. Our preliminary data also
showed that sympathetic-mediated macrophage activation may be important in nerve regeneration as well as
neuronal survival after nerve injury. Most interestingly, we found sympathetic-mediated immune/inflammatory
responses, nerve regeneration, and pain behaviors could be reversed when the adjacent sciatic lymph node
(LN) was removed, suggesting SNS-lymph node interactions may be critical for the development and possibly
management of neuropathic pain. We hypothesize that sympathetic sprouting and its interactions with sensory
neurons after nerve injury are neuroprotective and that sympathetic activation promotes cell survival but
enhances pain due to increased nerve/axonal regeneration. We further hypothesize that SNS mediates
immune responses, nerve regeneration, and cell survival by manipulation of macrophage activation, and, at
least, partially, by interactions with adjacent lymph nodes. The hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims
(SA): SA1: To determine whether sympathetic innervation is neuroprotective after peripheral nerve injury. SA2:
To examine the relationships between cell death, regeneration, and macrophage subtypes in mouse models of
neuropathic pain. SA3: To determine the role and function of adjacent lymph nodes (LN) in sympathetic
regulation of immune response, nerve regeneration and cell survival. Our hypothesis proposes some novel
concepts and represents a new direction for the study of sympathetic influences on pain and inflammation. The
proposed studies will investigate and characterize, for the first-time, the sympathetic influences on neuronal
survival, axonal regeneration at the level of sensory ganglia, and its interactions with lymph nodes in
neuropathic pain conditions, which have high incidence, cost, and morbidity and for which effective treatments
are often unavailable or unsatisfactory."

10932400,"Project Summary/Abstract
The re-allocation of metabolic resources towards cell processes that promote somatic maintenance is a long-
held hypothesis to explain how diverse longevity paradigms promote healthier aging. One of the best models of
this hypothesis is dietary restriction (DR), which optimizes metabolic efficiency while maintaining animal fitness
and longevity. However, we possess surprisingly little insight into how specific nutrient resources are differentially
utilized at the cell level during DR. In addition to altering metabolic processes, DR promotes a dramatic
remodeling of organelle structures and functions. Increasingly we understand that not only is the structure of a
discrete organelle critical for its functional state, but also the spatial relationships and contact sites formed
between different organelle networks. The restructuring of the overall subcellular architecture thus plays a critical
role in determining metabolic performance. However, our preliminary data suggest that age-dependent
accumulation of molecular damage causes remodeling of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a hub of inter-
organellar communication. Our overarching hypothesis is thus that remodeling of inter-organelle interactions is
is both a key route by which aging cells lose functional resilience and an essential mechanism of DR-mediated
reprogramming of metabolism. To advance this hypothesis we propose to exploit new correlative electron
microscopy (EM) and stable isotope imaging technology in a combination of mouse and C. elegans models to
establish a framework for how DR restructures the organelle interactome and re-allocates nutrient flux between
organelles. Altogether this proposal aims to establish a framework for how DR remodels the organelle
interactome to promote healthy aging with a focus on the role of the ER."
10891452,"This proposal will elucidate the function of the exocyst complex and actin dynamics in lipoprotein metabolism and its regulation by insulin. Our preliminary data reveal that insulin stimulates the recycling of the LDL Receptor in hepatocytes to increase the delivery of LPL into cells. We hypothesize that insulin controls the activity of the small GTPase RalA in hepatocytes by two pathways involving phosphorylation and inhibition of its GAP protein, and recruitment of its GEF protein. Once activated, RalA can interact with components of the targeting exocyst complex, resulting in the tethering of exocytotic vesicles containing the LDLR at discrete regions of the basolateral plasma membrane that are enriched in machinery required for fusion. We also hypothesize that insulin regulates the dynamics of cortical actin to propel LDLR endocytosis. We will evaluate: i) the role of the exocyst complex, and its regulators RalGAP, RalGEFs and RalA in the regulation of polarized LDLR exocytosis in hepatocytes; ii) the role of changes in the cortical actin cytoskeleton in governing LDLR endocytosis; iii) the physiological relevance of these hepatic signaling and trafficking events to overall lipoprotein metabolism. These new ideas and approaches will elucidate the key elements in control of these trafficking itineraries, and may ultimately generate valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying dyslipidemia in obesity and Type 2 diabetes."
10902097,"T3D-959 is a new chemical entity, orally delivered, small molecule, dual nuclear receptor agonist aimed at
improving dysfunctional brain glucose energy and lipid metabolism in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), it is non-
amyloid/non-tau-directed. Metabolic homeostasis, inherently altered in AD, leads to protein misfolding resulting
in plaque formation, tangle formation and inflammation. Exploratory human clinical test results (Phase 2a study)
of T3D-959 in mild to moderate severity AD patients have shown multiple efficacy signals indicating a potential
to slow, stop or reverse the course of disease. A larger and longer Phase 2 clinical trial statistically powered to
measure significant differences versus placebo in outcome measures of cognition, function, and biomarkers of
disease is in progress and will complete in early 2023. This Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled ‘PIONEER’ Study is assessing multiple T3D-959 dose strengths vs. placebo (15mg, 30mg & 45mg
QD and placebo in a 1:1:1:1 ratio) to identify the most safe and effective dose or doses to use in subsequent
Phase 3 testing. The multi-center trial involves 256 mild to moderate AD patients (MMSE=14-26) dosed orally
once-a-day for 24-weeks. Co-primary outcome measures include the ADAS-cog11 cognition and ADCS-CGIC
global function measures. Secondary outcome measures include executive function as measured by DSCT and
change from baseline in plasma Aβ 42/40 ratio. With the trial 75% completed preliminary results of blinded data,
grouped as a single average of the 3 drug strength arms and placebo arm, show potential improvement in all 3
measures of cognition, function, and executive function, even before one subtracts out placebo data at trial
conclusion and un-blinding. With an anticipated successful Phase 2 clinical trial on the horizon, it becomes
prudent to conduct FDA-required, non-clinical trial studies necessary for initiation of Phase 3 clinical trials and
New Drug Application submission (NDA for market approval) in alignment with the application’s broad, long-term
objective to advance the development of T3D-959 to market in the most expeditious manner possible. The
application’s goal is to examine the long-term carcinogenic potential of T3D-959 in rats per FDA guidelines as
indicated in ICH guidance S1A for investigational new drugs, which requires 2 years of dosing in a least one
rodent species (preferably rats) prior to market approval. The objectives of carcinogenicity studies are to identify
a tumorigenic potential in animals and to assess the relevant risk in humans. The practice of requiring
carcinogenicity studies in rodents was instituted for pharmaceuticals that are expected to be administered
regularly, continuously over a period of at least 6 months (i.e., a substantial part of a patient's lifetime)."
10930817,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Race-related traumatic online experiences have become daily stressors in the lives of adolescents of color.
Black adolescents for example, have an average of 5.2 incidents of racial discrimination per day, with those
occurring online as most frequent. Examples include witnessing calls for genocide of people of color, mock
lynchings, and having your intelligence questioned because of your race. Media literacy education and school-
based mental health interventions, where one might expect adolescents to receive preparation for these
experiences, are either inadequately preparing youth, or exclude a discussion of the issues altogether. Media
literacy programs, for example, only cover race through a cursory lens. Other school-based efforts, such as
mental health interventions, may be stigmatized or stigmatizing, limiting their effectiveness. There is a dire
need for training in how to critique and cope with race-related messages in a safe, and engaging environment,
free of stigma. We propose an unusually innovative and immersive virtual reality (VR) media literacy and
coping skills prevention intervention. Drawing on media literacy as health promotion framework, best practices
in immersive VR for psychoeducation, and culturally-responsive computing theory, we will design and develop
the intervention, and evaluate its efficacy with a pilot randomized controlled trial. The potential impact is far
reaching, including curbing the alarming, rising rates of depression, anxiety, and other mental health symptoms
among Black and Latinx communities since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The project is perfectly
aligned with the Transformative Research Award, in that findings have the potential to fundamentally reshape
how we educate young people to critique, counter, and cope with online experiences. Given that virtuality is
believed to be the wave of the future, with some arguing for a coming “metaverse,” where much of our lives will
be through VR, this project will provide a model for ensuring that psychoeducation, delivered by an immersive
VR intervention, can meet the unique needs of adolescents of color. In addition, we hope to usher in a world
where every internet user is educated about the mental health impacts of online social interactions and
experiences, as they receive expanded access. At the conclusion of this project, we will produce an immersive
VR intervention that has the potential to reduce disparities in access to mental health services in underserved
communities, leading to better mental health equity and outcomes among Black and Latinx adolescents. This
transformative experience will help Black and Latinx young people become more efficacious with respect to
racial coping. It will also provide a toolkit for students to imagine and create a digital world where they are able
to thrive in the face of traumatic online experiences."
10919164,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Intermittent energy restriction (IER) has been suggested to have important advantages over daily ER (DER) in
producing sustained weight loss and reducing cancer risk. While IER is already being promoted in the general
population to improve health and longevity, supportive evidence is urgently needed from rigorously conducted
randomized trials. We propose a six-month randomized trial to demonstrate the superiority of IER over DER in
reducing ectopic fat and total fat mass, and in improving cancer-related biomarkers and gut microbiome
functions. Our previous work strongly suggests that ectopic fat, independently of total adiposity, plays an
important role in the etiology of, and in the racial/ethnic disparities in, obesity-related cancers. We reported
striking racial/ethnic differences in the strength of the association between body mass index (BMI) and risk of
obesity-related cancers in the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC). We observed corresponding disparities in the
propensity to accumulate visceral and liver fat among the same five ethnic groups in a recent MRI-based study
and demonstrated an independent association of a robust biomarker-based visceral fat score with incident breast
cancer in MEC. Additionally, we adapted an IER protocol combined with a Mediterranean dietary pattern
(IER+MED) and demonstrated its feasibility, safety and greater efficacy over an active comparator (a heart-
healthy DER approach) in reducing total and ectopic adiposity and improving beneficial gut microbiome functions
in a 12-week randomized trial among 60 middle-aged adults of various Asian ethnicities with visceral obesity.
We now propose the Healthy Diet and Lifestyle Study II, a 24-week randomized trial of IER+MED vs. MED/DER
among 260 middle-aged Oahu adults of East-Asian, Pacific Islander or white ethnicity with VAT greater than the
population median. The intervention will be delivered through 16 focused and customized consultations with
research dietitians and will consist of an IER+MED (IER is 70% energy restriction on two consecutive days and
a euenergetic MED diet for the other five days of the week) or the MED with a 20% daily energy restriction
(MED/DER). Dietitians will monitor dietary compliance using the mobile food record (mFR) and compliance to a
common physical activity recommendation using interviews and actigraphy throughout the intervention. We will
compare IER+MED vs. MED/DER for reduction in MRI-measured visceral and liver fat and DXA-measured total
adiposity (Aim 1) and for improvement in cancer-related biomarkers (IGF-1, IGFBP3, insulin, HOMA-IR, leptin,
adiponectin, S HBG, hsCRP) and fecal metagenomic markers of microbial metabolite production (Aim 2). We
will also investigate behavioral predictors of adherence to the prescribed IER, including psychosocial measures
of self-efficacy and outcome expectancies, and dietary patterns based on timing and frequency of eating
episodes (Aim 3). This study will provide robust effectiveness data for IER on lowering cancer related risk factors
and inform future translational and dissemination research to reduce cancer risk in various US populations."

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) occurs mostly in adults 65 years and older and is associated with age-related
clonal hematopoiesis (CH). This condition that results from the clonal expansion of mutationally-marked
hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC). These HSPC expansions often feature somatic mutations in
leukemia-associated genes such as the epigenetic regulator TET2. TET2-mutant CH is a risk factor for AML,
and CH progression to AML is promoted by acquiring cooperating mutations such as constitutively active FLT3ITD.
Yet, it is unclear how aging and TET2 mutation interact to drive the evolution of CH to leukemia. We seek to
reveal the epigenetic mechanisms for how CH evolves to leukemia in an aging microenvironment, laying the
foundation for therapeutic strategies to block this evolution and prevent leukemia in the aging US population. To
this end, we will leverage our team's complementary expertise in intra-tumor heterogeneity and computational
epigenomics; aging, cancer evolution, and leukemogenesis; inflammation and hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)
biology; and mouse HSC proliferation and functional heterogeneity. Our preliminary results in mice show that
HSPC epigenetic heterogeneity increases in old age. This process occurs in an aged bone marrow (BM)
microenvironment characterized by inflammation and altered HSPC support. The rise of epigenetic and
transcriptomic heterogeneity in HSC with Tet2 mutation (Tet2MT) and Flt3ITD precedes leukemic transformation.
We hypothesize that aging and TET2 mutation cooperatively enhance epigenetic heterogeneity and evolvability
of HSPC, thus contributing to clonal expansion and leukemogenesis. In Aim 1, we will determine the combined
impact of aging and Tet2MT on epigenetic heterogeneity and gene regulation in HSPC by examining the somatic
epigenomic landscape of Tet2MT HSPC from young (2-3 months) and old (22 months) mice, including single-cell
(sc) transcriptomes by scRNA-seq, open-chromatin profiles by snATAC-seq, and DNA methylomes by RRBS.
We expect to define epigenetic configurations in old Tet2MT HSPC associated with genes in self-renewal,
quiescence, and responses to inflammation and stress. In Aim 2, we will define epigenetic configurations of
Tet2MT HSPC that are adaptive in the aged context. We will transplant genetically barcoded HSPC into young or
old mice and assess subclone expansion/contraction to determine if an age-dependent selection is for all Tet2MT
HSPC or only a subset. We will use scRNA-seq and snATAC-seq to define molecular signatures and epigenetic
heterogeneity of barcoded HSPC that are positively selected in the aged context. In Aim 3, we will define the
epigenetic configurations of Tet2MT HSPC that are permissive to Flt3ITD-induced transformation in the aged
context. We will transduce the Flt3ITD gene into young or aged Tet2MT or wild-type HSC and then transplant these
genetically barcoded cells into young or old host mice. We will assess the epigenetic profiles of the selected
HSPC by scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq of their identified progeny. We expect our findings will shift the paradigm
for how epigenetic plasticity promotes somatic evolution and leads to cancer initiation in aging individuals."

This application is in response to RFA-DK-20-003, which is a limited competition opportunity with the objective
of establishing the Liver Cirrhosis Network (LCN). Cirrhosis has doubled in prevalence in the last decade and is
now the 11th leading cause of death in the United States. The number of cirrhosis-related deaths is projected to
triple by 2030, with NASH projected to overtake HCV as the leading cause of liver transplantations. Severe limits
on the number of liver transplantations performed each year and anticipated increases in the cirrhosis patient
population create an urgent need to better understand predictors of mortality in cirrhosis and develop effective
therapies to treat cirrhosis. Studies from our group and others suggest statins may reduce future risk of HCC
and decompensation in patients with cirrhosis. Among statins, lipophilic statins such as atorvastatin have shown
the greatest chemopreventive effects against HCC occurrence. Atorvastatin is associated with dose-dependent
reduction in incident cirrhosis in HCV patients. Data supporting statin use for cirrhosis are promising, but larger,
randomized controlled trials (RCT) are needed to determine whether they may be routinely recommended. To
address the needs of the cirrhosis patient population, this research plan proposes the following aims: Aim 1: To
conduct a prospective, longitudinal, multicenter, multi-ethnic cohort study of patients with cirrhosis.
Among Hispanic men, cirrhosis is the 6th leading cause of mortality. To address this health disparity, we will test
the hypothesis that Hispanic patients with cirrhosis are at higher risk for hepatic decompensation compared to
non-Hispanics. We will establish and monitor a cohort of patients who have cirrhosis due to multiple etiologies.
Primary endpoints include (a) a composite endpoint of hepatic decompensation, (b) liver transplantation, or (c)
all–cause mortality. Ancillary studies will investigate associations between non-invasive imaging biomarkers,
cirrhosis genetic risk score, and risk of decompensation. Following up on our previous work, we will also identify
a microbiome signature that may predict decompensation risk. Aim 2: Phase 2, multi-center, double-blind,
placebo-controlled, RCT evaluating efficacy and safety of atorvastatin 20 mg in subjects with
compensated cirrhosis. The objective is to test the hypothesis that atorvastatin is more effective than placebo
in reducing risk of decompensation, all-cause mortality and other liver-related clinical outcomes in cirrhosis
patients. Primary outcome measure will be time to the first occurrence of any of the following adjudicated events:
all-cause mortality, MELD score ≥ 15, liver transplant, ascites requiring medical intervention, hospitalization for
onset of variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and development of
hepatocellular carcinoma. Secondary outcomes include safety of atorvastatin, decrease in fibrosis, as measured
by NITs and imaging biomarkers, and major adverse cardiovascular events. Exploratory analyses will investigate
associations between treatment response and (a) delta MRE and VCTE, (b) genetic risk factors, and (c) changes
in the gut microbiome."

By 8th grade, one in five Black youth and one in four Latinx youth has tried some form of alcohol, nicotine, or
cannabis - well after substance use related cognitions (e.g., perceived harm), which impact risk for use - have
started to form. Prevention efforts must be grounded in knowledge of how modifiable risk and protective factors
that are present prior to early adolescence may vary within (e.g., by gender) and between racial/ethnic groups
in their influences on precursors to and early substance use behaviors. Focusing on understudied cultural factors
that are especially salient for Black and Latinx youth, such as racial/ethnic discrimination and environmental
factors that are highly prevalent in Black and Latinx communities, such as religious involvement, the proposed
etiological study will integrate methodological approaches that can address both their unique and collective
influences on substance use related cognitions and use from pre- to mid-adolescence. This secondary data
analysis project is based on the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (total N=11,878), an ongoing
multi-site, population-based longitudinal study of adolescent development. Drawing on data collected at ages 9-
16 from the 10,360 participants (47.8% female) that were identified by their parents as Black (17.2%), Latinx
(23.2%), or White (59.6%), we will address three core aims. First, we will use person-centered analyses (mixture
modeling) to identify latent profiles (subgroups) of risk and protection based on cultural and environmental factors
(e.g., acculturation, parental support) and substance use related cognitions (perceived harm, expectancies,
intentions to use) that predate and evolve as a function of substance use. Second, to gain a more nuanced
perspective on the early course of substance use, we will apply mixture modeling, survival analysis, and a novel
modeling approach integrating the two, to identify possible distinctions between and among Black, Latinx, and
White youth in timing of progression through early stages (experimentation, initiation, and - as the cohort ages -
regular use), circumstances of use (e.g., how obtained), as well as type/method of use (e.g., beer vs. hard liquor,
cannabis vaping vs. edibles). Third, building on this foundation, we will identify cultural and environmental
influences that modify the course of substance use in Black and Latinx youth, focusing on common prevention
targets, such as ethnic identity and parental monitoring. In addition to extending the models (e.g., incorporating
moderators) derived for Aims 1 and 2, we will apply propensity score matching, integrating geocoded
neighborhood data, to parse out the unique influence of risk factors, such as trauma, from the conditions that
elevate risk for experiencing them. Identifying similarities and distinctions across and considering differences
within (e.g., by gender) racial/ethnic groups in the impact of cultural and environmental influences on precursors
to and early stages of substance use will contribute to refining etiological models of substance involvement in
Black and Latinx youth that can inform prevention and ultimately reduce substance use related health disparities."
10933443,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Nearly one million people in the USA are living with Parkinson’s disease (PD). It is a disabling
neurodegenerative disease that causes progressive difficulty with movement, however equally
debilitating is the progressive impairment of motivation that is experienced by most patients.
Patients struggle to initiate things they want to do (apathy) and can also have difficulty
suppressing things that they do not want to do (impulsivity) – symptoms that are defined here as
impaired motivated behavior. There are no effective treatments for these symptoms and indeed,
some PD medications can make them worse. It is urgent to understand how these symptoms
originate in the brain in order develop new and effective treatments. The proposed research uses
precise optogenetic and physiological tools available in mice to characterize the brain networks
responsible for these symptoms of impaired motivation. These tools allow modulation and
monitoring of brain activity at millisecond timescales at the level of specific cell-types (neurons)
and groups of different neurons (circuits). This provides a powerful approach to determine how
specific neurons and circuits in the brain cause changes in behavior. We know that patients living
with PD have abnormal brain activity in an area deep in the brain known as the globus pallidus
(GPe). Therefore, this research proposes to use a high temporal resolution behavior task to
investigate the role of GPe in motivated behavior. In this task, normal mice quickly learn to lick a
water spout on hearing a cue that signals water is about to be delivered (Go cue), and restrain
licking after another cue signals that water is not forthcoming (NoGo cue). When the activity of
neurons in the GPe is increased, mice become more impulsive - specifically, they have difficulty
restraining themselves from licking the spout after the NoGo cue. This suggests that the GPe is
a key brain region involved in motivated behavior. However, it is not known which cells or circuits
in the GPe are responsible for driving this behavior, nor how they are disrupted in PD. The
proposed research will manipulate specific neural populations (Specific Aim 1) and neural circuits
(Specific Aim 2) in the GPe to determine how they contribute to motivated behavior in healthy
mice. These findings will be translated to a mouse model of PD (Specific Aim 3) to enable the
design of cell type- and circuit-specific interventions to rescue abnormal neural activity patterns
and behaviors seen in the PD model (Specific Aim 3). The long-term objective of this work is to
provide a framework to understand the neural circuit abnormalities underlying the diverse and
challenging symptoms experienced by patients with PD and other neuropsychiatric disorders, to
promote the development of more effective and specific pharmaceutical and surgical therapies."

Urine is an attractive biospecimen for point-of-care diagnostics because it can be collected in large quantities
with noninvasive procedures. Urine-based lateral flow assays (LFAs) are low-cost devices suitable for
point-of-care testing, particularly in low-resource settings. However, many urine-based LFAs exhibit sensitivity
levels well below diagnostic utility due to the low concentration of diagnostic biomarkers present in urine. This
is the case with LFAs for tuberculosis (TB) diagnostics and is a major barrier to rapid TB testing and treatment
in endemic areas. Mainstream clinical and laboratory tests for diagnosing active TB, including bacterial culture,
sputum smear microscopy and nucleic acid amplification tests, present limitations in speed, sensitivity,
accessibility, respectively. These tests also require sputum samples that present additional difficulty and
exposure risks for healthcare staff during the collection procedure.
To address this, we developed an osmotic processor that statically and spontaneously concentrates urinary
biomarkers for use in LFAs. Urea and small molecules that can interfere with downstream assays are removed
in the concentration process. Using human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) protein as a model analyte, we
showed near 100-fold concentration of a 20 mL sample in an early prototype. By exploiting the principles of
osmosis, recent prototypes developed by the company show promise in significantly reducing processing time
to within 30 minutes. With its simplicity and flexibility, the device demonstrates a great potential to be interfaced
with existing LFAs to enable highly sensitive detection of dilute target analytes in urine, while still retaining a
diagnostic time suitable for point-of-care diagnostics. The project aims to validate molecule concentration
quantitatively with mass spectrometry in newer prototypes, perform spike-and-recovery tests with simulated
urine and lab-based LAM, and then test qualitatively with TB-positive clinical samples and LFAs.
If awarded the Phase I SBIR grant, the team will hire another full time research scientist, register our device as
a General Controls Device through the FDA, continue business collaborations with companies developing
LFAs, research other applications of the device to process other biomarkers for diagnostic, disease monitoring
and therapeutic purposes, and plan scale-up of device production for commercial distribution in preparation of
Phase II."
10696309,"The objective of this proposal is to decipher the mechanistic role of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-12 and its
downstream effector molecules in mediating cytotoxicity and inflammation after spinal cord injury (SCI), a severe
condition with devastating consequences for the neurological function and overall health of affected persons.
Despite some beneficial inflammatory effects on tissue preservation after SCI, excessive and prolonged
inflammation in the injured spinal cord has emerged as a crucial mediator of secondary tissue damage,
significantly expanding the tissue loss beyond that created by the initial trauma. Paradoxically, SCI also causes
systemic immunosuppression, with resultant high risk of life-threatening infections like pneumonia, making it a
crucial task to target the detrimental intraparenchymal inflammation within the spinal cord, without interfering
with beneficial immune reactions both in the spinal cord parenchyma and systemically.
 We have previously shown that IL-12 leads to significantly impaired locomotor recovery and tissue
damage after SCI. IL-12 and its receptors are predominantly expressed on astrocytes after SCI. However, the
mechanism of IL-12-mediated tissue damage, if directly via cytotoxic effector molecules or indirectly by regulating
the inflammatory response, is currently unknown. This information is of high importance for the development of
future therapeutic approaches.
 We hypothesize that IL-12 signaling originating in astrocytes promotes secondary tissue damage
resulting in functional impairment. We designed the following three aims to address this hypothesis: (i) We will
determine if cell-specific deletion of IL-12 signaling in astrocytes or microglia improves functional locomotor
recovery and reduced autonomic impairment. This will provide information about the cell types initiating IL-12
mediated tissue damage. (ii) We will then determine the effect of specific, local inhibition of STAT1 and STAT4,
known signaling factors of downstream IL-12 effector functions. We will determine the effect of blocking these
specific signals, using well-established techniques of intraspinal injection of AAV-driven shRNA, followed by SCI,
and determination of tissue preservation and the inflammatory response, using cell-specific transcriptomic and
spatial profiling approaches. Finally, we will (iii) assess the functional impact of STAT1 and STAT4 on locomotor
and autonomic recovery.
 In summary, this proposal will provide valuable insights into the mechanism of pro-inflammatory cytokine
function after SCI. It can contribute to developing novel therapeutic approaches in the future with the goal to
reduce tissue damage and improve function. This project has high significance for the active military population,
veterans, and civilians, given the incidence of spine trauma and SCI, and the immense potential in targeting
inflammation for mitigating secondary damage after SCI to improve functional outcomes, health, and quality of
life."
10696315,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a debilitating disease that causes inflammation and deforming joint destruction.
RA afflicts 1.5 million people in the United States and is becoming increasingly more prevalent in the veteran
community as this population ages. It is also one of the most expensive illnesses to treat, resulting in hundreds
of millions of dollars in increased health care spending by the Veteran Administration (VA). The underlying
cause of RA remains unclear. Infections driving a misdirected response to self-proteins has been hypothesized
to underlie RA and other autoimmune diseases, but why some people remain healthy whereas others develop
autoimmunity remain poorly understood. Using SARS-CoV-2 infection as a model, we will investigate RA-
related differences in immune composition before exposure and determine how it responds to infection. The
proposed study will test the overarching hypothesis that disrupted interaction with the microbiome in RA
patients amplifies cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells at baseline, which contributes to
broadening of T cell and antibody responses after SARS-CoV-2 infection. In Aim 1, we will determine how
pre-existing cross-reactive responses change in patients with RA. We have recently demonstrated that CD4+ T
cells from healthy adults are capable of recognizing SARS-CoV-2 prior to exposure. Further, a subset of
SARS-CoV-2 specific precursors respond to commensal bacteria. Building on this, we will determine if the
basal level of T cell cross-reactivity becomes amplified in an autoimmune setting. In Aim 2, we will determine
how COVID-19 impacts cross-reactive responses. We will test if infection drives further expansion of cross-
reactive T cells in RA patients and define the relationship between the breadth of CD4+ T cells and antibody
responses. Data generated from these experiments will provide vital knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 specific T
cells and address fundamental questions on cross-reactive responses in humans. These findings will likely be
relevant beyond SARS-CoV-2 to inform cross-reactive responses to other pathogens."
10783080,"ABSTRACT
In mammals, spinal cord injury frequently leads to irreversible damage mainly due to the very limited capacity of
injured central nervous system (CNS) axons to reconnect with their preinjury targets. Functional regeneration
requires injured CNS axons to extend over long distances and reconnect with their original synaptic targets,
however even in animal models current treatment strategies produce only modest levels of recovery. Despite
enormous progress over the past decades, our knowledge and understanding of the fundamental molecular
pathways and mechanisms that contribute to the process of spinal cord regeneration has left many fundamental
questions unanswered. For example, are growth rates of regenerating axons uniform, are they preprogramed
and invariable or are they modulated as they extend towards and into the injury site? And if so, what mechanisms
and genes regulate and tune regenerating growth rates? In contrast to mammals, non-mammalian vertebrates
including zebrafish have retained a remarkable capacity for spontaneous CNS regeneration. We have developed
a laser-based axotomy approach to study spinal cord regeneration in larval zebrafish at single axon resolution
in otherwise intact animals. From a candidate screen we identified the Cadherin EGF LAG receptor celsr3 to
play a critical role in CNS regeneration. Our preliminary data reveal that in wild type animals regenerating M-ell
axons switch to 3 fold higher growth rates once they cross the injury site. Celsr3 mutant M-cell axons respond
to injury and grow across the injury site at growth rates indistinguishable from wildtype siblings, but then fail to
increase their growth rates and frequently stall prematurely at about 25% of pre-injury length. Thus, our
preliminary results identified a genetic entry point into the fundamental yet understudied question of whether and
if so through which molecular mechanisms regenerating spinal cord axons regulate their growth rates along their
regenerative path as their environment changes. Finally, we find that Celsr3 is also required for optic nerve
regeneration but is dispensable for peripheral nerve regeneration, strongly suggesting that Celsr3 plays a
selective role in CNS axon regeneration. The experiments in this proposal will (1) determine cellular and
molecular mechanism by which Celsr3 growth rates selectively of regenerating CNS axons; (2) identify the
molecular signaling cascade through which celsr3 promotes regeneration; and (3) Identify additional entry points
into pathways that promote spontaneous spinal cord regeneration. Combined, our results are expected to make
significant contributions to fundamental mechanisms that promote spontaneous spinal cord regeneration in vivo,
and lay the foundation for a comprehensive analysis of spontaneous spinal cord regeneration. Although
spontaneous spinal cord regeneration is largely absent in mammals, mechanisms of spontaneous spinal cord
regeneration might be masked and thus undetectable by the presence and dominance of growth inhibitory
mechanism. Our studies therefore complement studies in mammalian models that focus predominantly on
strategies to overcome growth inhibition."
10798256,"Project Summary
Stroke is the leading cause of disability in the United States. Despite the effectiveness of thrombolysis and
thrombectomy, outcomes after stroke remain poor and effective cerebroprotectant therapies are needed. This
project will leverage the complementary expertise of a Stroke Neurologist/Immunologist and a
Bioengineer/Imaging scientist to jointly develop and test drug delivery of cerebroprotectants by lipid
nanoparticles that specifically target the ischemic brain.
Ischemic stroke after vascular occlusion dramatically alters tissue metabolism. A hypoxic environment ensues
due to reduced oxygen supply to shift metabolism towards anaerobic glycolysis for energy supply, and which in
turn produces excessive acidic byproducts which are extruded into the extracellular environment. Thus, the
hypoxic and acidic microenvironment of an ischemic lesion may be exploited to direct infarct-specific therapy.
We will use hypoxia- and pH-sensitive lipid nanoparticles that cross the blood-brain barrier to deliver high
payloads of cerebroprotective and anti-inflammatory agents specifically into the ischemic brain. Our hypothesis
is that hypoxia and pH targeted nanoparticles will enhance drug delivery into the ischemic brain, maximizing
cerebroprotection and improving stroke outcomes.
Preliminary work in our experimental model of ischemic stroke using these lipid nanoparticles show the
nanoparticle accumulate in the ischemic brain within minutes and persist for at least two days. These can be
tracked longitudinally by MRI due to the co-incorporation of gadolinium along with cerebroprotectant
medications in the nanoparticles. We propose two Aims to study the concentration and duration of drug
delivery to the ischemic brain and test the effects on infarct volume, inflammation, and functional outcomes in
mice after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. If successful, the strategy can be applied to other
candidate drugs for stroke as well as other diseases characterized by tissue hypoxia and acidosis. Given the
biocompatibility of all materials used to synthesize lipid nanoparticles, we expect high translational potential of
this method into larger species and eventually into clinical tests."

Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) affects up to 1:250 individuals and is responsible for ~40% of cardiac transplants.
Guidelines recommend genetic testing in DCM probands to help establish diagnosis, guide medical care, inform
risk stratification, and identify at-risk relatives. However, causal variants are identified in fewer than half of
patients, ~30-40% of tests return variants of uncertain significance (VUS), and a modest number of genes have
adequate genotype-phenotype data to inform medical management. In this proposal we address 4 gaps in DCM
research: 1) Most data are from individuals of European ancestry referred for genetic testing, creating bias in
estimates of the contribution, penetrance, and phenotype in the broader clinical and community population. 2)
Most established DCM genes have insufficient genotype-phenotype data to inform gene-specific clinical
management. 3) The evidence for most candidate genes is equivocal due to lack of study in cohorts sufficiently
large to evaluate pathogenicity. 4) Some disease loci likely remain undiscovered because GWAS and linkage
approaches used in prior studies are not well-powered for diseases, such as DCM, with variable age of onset,
both high genetic and allelic heterogeneity, and incomplete penetrance. We will address these fundamental
knowledge gaps using innovative genetic methods and a novel, large-scale DCM research platform that includes
harmonized phenotypic, genotyping, sequencing, and identity-by-descent (IBD) data from 5 large biobanks
comprising ~1M participants and >10,000 DCM cases. Specifically, we propose to use rare variant and IBD-
based methods to: Aim 1) Define the contribution and phenotypic manifestations of established disease genes
in multiple diverse, non-referral DCM populations; Aim 2) Assess the pathogenicity of candidate DCM genes with
equivocal evidence and establish a novel platform to evaluate VUS in established genes; and Aim 3: Discover
novel DCM genes via IBD mapping and rare variant association within and across biobanks at scale. To balance
the innovation of these aims, we present compelling preliminary data demonstrating the feasibility of our
approaches which identified a cluster of distantly related individuals harboring a common pathogenic variant in
RBM20. We anticipate these analyses will substantially expand our understanding of the genetic factors
underlying DCM risk and their clinical manifestations. Once established, our platform will support future clinical
and genetic research and advance the long-term goal of implementing targeted interventions at the clinic and
population level to reduce the burden of DCM for all patients."

Influenza (flu) virus, an NIAID category C priority pathogen, causes a respiratory disease resulting in over 200,000 hospitalizations and ~ 36,000 deaths per year in the US, while global influenza pandemics have resulted in as many as 50-100 million deaths worldwide. To address this threat to public health, annual vaccination is recommended for all individuals aged over 6 months in the US. However, currently available vaccines are lacking in efficacy. CDC’s vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates for the 2014-2015 influenza season was only 23%. The reduced protection was attributed to the fact that the circulating viruses had drifted from the H3N2 vaccine virus recommended for vaccine production. In fact overall VE from 2005-2016 ranges from 10% to 60% at best. Current influenza vaccines, live or inactivated, offer suboptimal protection when matched and do not provide protection when the vaccine is mismatched.

FluGen has developed a novel M2-deficient influenza vaccine (M2SR) that provides effective heterosubtypic protection in animal models. In addition, we have shown that an H1N1 M2SR elicits protection against drifted H1N1 viruses in ferrets. Moreover, H1N1 M2SR provided protection against lethal H5N1 pandemic virus in ferrets. A prototype H3N2 M2SR vaccine, shown to be generally safe and well-tolerated in clinical trials and elicited immune responses in healthy adult subjects who were seronaive, seropositive and seroprotected. The H3N2 M2SR also provided protection against a highly drifted influenza virus in a human challenge trial.

In this project, we propose to further develop M2SR as a quadrivalent (Quad) universal influenza vaccine that provides effective protection against drifted influenza viruses in the following specific aims: Aim 1a. Transfer of M2SR and BM2SR production platforms to US-based CMO. Aim 1b. Analytical method transfer, development and qualification at US-based CMO. These activities will accelerate development of the M2SR influenza vaccine toward a quadrivalent vaccine product that can provide broad cross-protection against drifted influenza viruses."

 Motion related artifacts are a significant source of cost to the healthcare system. With over 12,000 MRI
scanners in the U.S. and estimates that $434,000 are lost per scanner each year, motion in MRIs is costing our
health care system approximately $4B yearly. Our FDA-cleared software solution Framewise Integrated Real-
Time MRI Monitoring (FIRMM) mitigates data lost due to motion. However, the majority of paying customers so
far are academic neuroimaging research centers; in order to ensure the commercial success of FIRMM, we
need to expand the customer base to clinical institutions. The goal of this CRP application is to fill gaps in
FIRMM clinical commercialization sales by partnering with Siemens and building functionality to streamline
clinical use of FIRMM and FIRMM-pix.
 Leading hospitals have expressed enthusiasm to use FIRMM for clinical care; however, two main
barriers to clinical adoption remain: a reduction in technician critical decision making and a seamless
integration into existing clinical workflows. Both of these barriers can be overcome via Siemens’ Access-I,
which provides an FDA approved licensing and authentication scheme to enable secure and direct operation of
Siemens systems from any 3rd party vendor device. Pairing the FIRMM tablet with Siemens' Access-I module
will allow for the FIRMM tablet to re-start a scan automatically when the quality is low via a direct interaction
with the clinical scanner, thus saving time, easing workflows, and standardizing decision making for
technicians. Integrating the FIRMM tablet with Siemens' Access-I will lead to a more seamless integration into
existing workflows; thus reducing the disruption to existing complex clinical workflows.
 In addition, integrating the FIRMM tablet with Siemens' Access-I module will facilitate the wide-spread
adoption of FIRMM(-pix) in the clinical market by obtaining widespread visibility via co-marketing with Siemens
Healthineers and their catalog. Importantly, this partnership with Siemens is planned only as an initial step to
establishing clinical commercialization sales. Although Siemens is the leading MRI manufacturer, GE and
Philips combine with Siemens to account for almost 90% of the MRI market. The proposed activities in this
CRP will form the basis of future work to establish similar partnerships with GE and Philips. Overall, this CRP
is perfectly positioned to put FIRMM and its subsequent products on a pathway to long-term success."

This is an innovation that embodies the NIH mission of improving healthcare outcomes by providing
preterm infants the valuable nutrients only found in mother’s milk increasing their chance of survival
and improved overall health. The goal of this research is to tailor the technology to the specific needs of
the NICU and prove superior performance in decreasing feeding intolerance and increasing growth
through two preclinical evaluations. Human milk is the best feeding option for preterm infants.
However, to meet the high nutrient needs of preterm infants in Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs),
mother’s own milk is often mixed with bovine milk sourced fortifiers to achieve nutrient level goals. This
is done despite the bovine sourced fortifiers potential to increase risk of dangerous feeding intolerance,
to negatively impact immune system, microbiome development and even long-term health by
increasing risk of lung and eye diseases. These risks along with the breakdown of the infant formula

Milk Concentration (HMC) device is a safe and simple solution- it uses a passive osmotic process to
remove some of the water from milk so that preterm infants can receive optimal nutrients from their
own mother’s milk without cow’s milk additives and helps support breast feeding moms providing an
alternative to moving straight to formula. The success of the work will further bring convincing evidence
of the safety and efficacy of this technology supporting the final development phase of the membrane:
preparing for FDA submission, submission and finally clinical testing. Mother’s Milk Is Best Inc (MMIB)’s
Phase II objectives are to 1) create an HMC formulation and casting process specific for a medical device
application 2) Design and test 2 product embodiments for specific use cases and 3) perform pre-clinical
tests to determine the impact of feeding concentrated HM to neonatal gut cell derived enteroids 4)
Compare growth metrics and gut health in mice fed concentrated milk, unconcentrated milk and
formula. Once the membrane formulation has been tested and fabrication process set per medical
device and HMC requirements, MMIB will be confident in the safety and efficacy of the device thus
advancing the technology one step toward use of the HMC in the NICU and milk banks to help preterm
infants thrive."
10895355,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Studies have shown much broader roles for macrophages in responding to inflammation and tissue injury than
previously recognized, such as promoting inflammation resolution, tissue repair and restoring tissue homeostasis
and this recognition of macrophage plasticity has shifted the focus away from the simple notion of M1 and M2
dichotomies. Project 3 focuses on delineating the signals mediating monocyte transition to tissue macrophages and
their potentially essential role in tissue repair in acute lung injury (ALI). As the lung endothelium is the entry point of
the monocytes transmigrating into tissue, endothelial cells (ECs) may modify the downstream macrophage
phenotype, and thus the interaction between cells may be of great consequence. Project 3 will delineate
mechanisms of generation of how ECs instruct macrophages and their role in resolving ALI. We will address
fundamental questions including: What are the EC signals mediating transition to the reparative macrophage
populations? What signals in macrophages in turn convert the cells to repair tissue? What are the epigenetic and
transcriptomic features of these phenotype-shifted macrophages? In Project 3 we will test the hypothesis that the
lung endothelium via Wnt signaling mediates macrophage phenotype transition through modifying mitochondrial
metabolism and epigenome that initiates specific transcriptional programs. In Aim 1, we will define the role of
endothelial Wnt signaling in regulating the differentiation of monocytes to macrophages in lungs. Here we will
determine the role of the Wnt signaling regulator Rspondin 3 (Rspo3) derived from ECs in signaling the transition of
monocytes to lung macrophages. In Aim 2, we will determine the role of metabolic reprogramming and epigenetic
modifications of macrophages in mediating phenotype transition and thereby reducing the extent of lung injury as
well as promoting its resolution."
10908547,"PROJECT SUMMARY: ADMINISTRATIVE CORE
All three Partnering institutions, Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM), Tuskegee University (TU), and the UAB
O’Neal Comprehensive Cancer Center (UAB OCCC), have established Administrative Cores. As part of the
currently active U54, efficient administrative infrastructure is in place at each of the three institutions. This core's
primary objectives are for coordination, communication, budgetary oversight, and clerical functions associated
with the overall research program proposed in this grant application. The Partnership has four Cores
(Administrative, Outreach, Planning and Evaluation, and Research Education), Research Projects (two Full
Projects and a Pilot Project), and two Shared Resources (Bioethics and Biostatistics/Bioinformatics). The
Partnership Administrative Core, which is responsible for administrative management of Partnership-wide
activities, is comprised of the institution-specific Executive Committees (ECs), the Partnership Leadership
Committee (PLC), the Internal Advisory Committee (IAC), and the Program Steering Committee (PSC). The
ECs, consisting of all institution-specific Principal Investigators (PIs) (contact-PI, MPIs, and Co-Leaders of all
cores and shared resources), meet once a month and are responsible for the day-to-day oversight at each
institution. The PLC, consisting of the PIs and co-leaders of all three institutions, as in the past, will have a
monthly teleconference and will be responsible for internal planning, execution, and assessment of the
Partnership activities. The IAC, consisting of six leaders (two from each Partnering institution), reviews, twice a
year, the Partnership’s progress and decisions and guides the overall Partnership. The PSC, consisting of five
external members, whose expertise covers all areas of the proposed research programs, and an NCI-official as
an ex-officio member, functions as the external review body, which annually evaluates all components of the
Partnership’s progress and provides guidance. Further, together with Planning and Evaluation Core, a Scientific
Review Committee, consisting of all PIs and a science editor, will solicit pilot projects to be funded in years 4 and
5 of the funding cycle and assigns them to external reviewers to assess their scientific merit and funds them after
obtaining approvals from PSC. The expertise of the PIs of all three institutions is complementary to each other,
and most of these leaders have been productively working together for more than 10 years. Together with
Administrative/Finance Officers of the respective institutions, the Program Managers aid the Partnership by
providing day-to-day administrative support, coordination, preparation of the annual progress reports, and
logistical services needed to accomplish the Partnership functions. Additionally, the Presidents and PIs of all
three institutions will continue to conduct yearly joint video conferences to discuss progress of the Partnership
and to reaffirm their continued commitment to strengthen, integrate, and expand Partnership activities."

(This Core is identical for all three Partnering Institutions)
The Partnership between the Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM), Tuskegee University (TU), and the
University of Alabama at Birmingham O’Neal Comprehensive Cancer Center (UAB OCCC) presents a distinct
opportunity to build on our accomplishments in education of future cancer research scientists, with an emphasis
on underrepresented racial/ethnic minorities, and to advance cancer research at all three institutions with a focus
on cancer disparities in the context of a bidirectional engagement with urban and rural communities in Alabama
and Georgia. For this U54 Partnership, evaluation will be conducted by a team of evaluators representing each
partnering institution, who meet monthly to discuss progress, issues, and solutions: Dr. Isabel Scarinci and Ms.
Sylvia Peral (UAB OCCC), Dr. Desiree Rivers (MSM), and Mr. Lecarde Webb (TU). Although they will work
together, each will be primarily responsible for specific Cores and Shared Resources. This team makes
recommendations to be implemented administratively by the Principal Investigators with the advice, guidance,
and direction of each institution’s Executive Committee, the Partnership Leadership Committee (PLC), the
Internal Advisory Committee (IAC), and the Program Steering Committee (PSC). Each Core, Research Project,
and Shared Resource of this Partnership will have its own evaluation plan/worksheet outlining the evaluation
questions for each specific aim, tasks, data collection tools, the person responsible for each task, and timeline.
Process evaluation results will be discussed monthly at the PLC meetings, and comprehensive yearly written
reports will be shared with the IAC and PSC for feedback and guidance. It should be noted that, although each
component will have its own evaluation plan, an integrated evaluation process will be conducted to synergize all
components to achieve the long-term goal of eliminating cancer health disparities."
10908557,"PROGRAM SUMMARY: RESEARCH EDUCATION CORE
(This Core is identical for all three Partnering Institutions)
The Partnership between Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM)/Tuskegee University (TU)/University of
Alabama at Birmingham O’Neal Comprehensive Cancer Center (MSM/TU/UAB OCCC) presents a distinctive
opportunity to build on our successful accomplishments in education of future cancer research scientists moving
through our pipeline, with an emphasis on underrepresented racial/ethnic minorities. In this U54 renewal
application, we propose a seamless integration of our cancer education programs by focusing on “hard”
(structured courses/training developed through previous U54 funding) and “soft” skills (e.g., career
development roadmap, interviewing skills) needed to facilitate movement through our pipeline into the cancer
research continuum, with the goal of having a diverse workforce in cancer research. This will be accomplished
through the following specific aims: Aim 1. To develop and implement integrated cancer research education
programs to link high school, undergraduate, and graduate/medical students with postdoctoral fellows, medical
residents, and Early Stage Investigators (ESIs), and senior-level researchers/mentors with a particular focus on
underrepresented racial/ethnic minorities in science. Four integrated programs will be utilized: (a) the Granting
Research Opportunities in Wellness by Creating Exciting Learning Laboratories in Science (GROW CELLS)
for high school students; (b) the Cancer Research Immersion Student Program (CRISP) for undergraduate
students; (c) the Summer Cancer Research Education Program (SCREP) for graduate and medical students;
and (d) the Health Disparities Research Education Program (HDREP) for medical residents, postdoctoral
fellows, and ESIs. Aim 2. To link all levels of cancer research scholars with the Outreach Core to share their
research findings with community members, obtain community feedback on relevant topics for future research
(e.g., Cancer Info Cafés), and develop publications and communications for lay audiences (e.g., blogs or posts
on social media, YouTube videos, policy briefs). Aim 3. To implement a mixed-method, triangulated evaluation
of the proposed research education activities across the pipeline. These efforts will increase the recruitment and
retention of underrepresented minorities in science, specifically in cancer research, that are congruent with the
goals expressed in the NIH’s Interest in Diversity Statement."
10908560,"PROJECT SUMMARY: OUTREACH (This core is identical to all three partnering institutions)
The overall goal of the Outreach Core is to implement and evaluate an evidence-based, theory-informed, multi-
level, clinical trial and cancer genomics education program (CTC-GEP) that addresses the determinants for
African American (AA) and Latinx participation in clinical trials and cancer genomics studies. The CTC-GEP is
informed by the Increasing Minority Participation in Clinical Trials (IMPaCT) program, an efficacious clinical trials
navigator program implemented at the University of Alabama at Birmingham O’Neal Comprehensive Cancer
Center. We will build on the findings of this program and extend application of the patient navigation model to
participation in clinical trials and genomic cancer research. A cadre of lay community navigator professionals
will be trained and serve as clinical trials navigators (CCN) to deliver two unique types of toolkits comprised of
evidence-based educational resources on research participation (low-tech) and culturally tailored educational
and multiple media content via mobile tablet technology (high-tech). The CCNs will deliver these toolkits and
provide logistical support to participants interested in participating in cancer research in rural and urban
community health and academic research centers within the Partnership catchment areas. The CTC-GEP will
also address AA and Latinx beliefs, values, attitudes, concerns, and preferences related to participation in
research, such as privacy, trust, and safety. An evaluation plan based on a logic model will be applied throughout
the project. Outcome measures will be assessed through pre- and post- surveys. The outcomes of the CTC-
GEP include a) intentions to participate in research, b) awareness and knowledge about research, and c)
genomic research and clinical trial enrollment. Additionally, having a Joint Clinical and Biomedical Research
Advisory Roundtable (JCAR) guided, clinical community navigation and education program will lead to increased
awareness, opportunity and participation in genomic research and clinical trials among a diverse population of
AAs and Latinx. The rationale for this Core, intended to facilitate research and not conduct research, is to identify
effective strategies to facilitate research participation among AA and Latinx populations. Thus, the activities
outlined in this proposal are congruent with the strategies in the Comprehensive Partnerships to Advance Cancer
Health Equity (CPACHE) RFA listed for the Outreach Core."

10808895,"PROJECT SUMMARY
There is an urgent need to develop non-addictive analgesic agents for the treatment of abdominal pain which is
common in gastrointestinal disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease
(IBD). Glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII) is a metallopeptidase that is expressed throughout the central and
peripheral nervous systems (CNS, PNS respectively), where it regulates glutamate neurotransmission.
Glutamate is the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in the body and is known to be a key player in
nociception and pain signaling. In fact, small molecule GCPII inhibitors have been previously demonstrated to
exert potent analgesic effects in numerous rodent models of inflammatory, neuropathic and musculoskeletal
pain. While GCPII’s role in CNS and PNS pain pathways are well characterized, GCPII’s expression and function
have not yet been studied in the enteric nervous system. We have recently discovered that GCPII is present
throughout the ENS, with prominent expression in enteroendocrine cells (EEC) of the ileum and colon. EECs
are a population of cells located throughout the gastrointestinal epithelium that are responsible for sensing
luminal stimuli, secreting various hormones and neurotransmitters, and that have been reported to participate in
vagal afferent signaling and bi-directional gut brain axis communication. Here, we will study the biology of GCPII
in EEC-associated visceral pain signaling. Our central hypothesis is that GCPII regulates EEC glutamate
secretion, altering subsequent vagal afferent activation and visceral pain signaling. In Aim #1, we will develop a
glutamate biosensor assay to assess GCPII’s role as a modulator of EEC glutamate secretion, including
evaluation of a small molecule GCPII inhibitor, CRISPR/Cas9 knockdown and administration of an exogenous
GCPII substrate. In Aim #2, we will characterize GCPII expression changes over time in an established rodent
abdominal pain model and will characterize the cellular markers of EEC subpopulations expressing GCPII. In
Aim #3, we will create a novel mouse with targeted deletion of GCPII in EECs, and will objectively measure
visceral pain reaction in response to aversive colorectal distension stimulation to study GCPII’s role in EEC-
associated visceral pain signaling in an in vivo model system. Collectively, this research will expand our
knowledge regarding GCPII expression and function in visceral pain, laying the preclinical foundation for future
studies to develop novel therapeutics for abdominal pain."

The incidence of human papillomavirus-positive (HPV+) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is
rising and while treatment options are available, they remain limited primarily to surgical excision, radiation
therapy, and chemotherapy which often result in long term morbidity. RNA interference (RNAi) appears to be a
promising therapeutic tool for the treatment of many diseases, including HPV+ related cancers, through targeting
viral oncogenes, E6 and E7, with small interfering RNAs (siRNA). The expression of E6 and E7 viral oncoproteins
inhibits the p53 and pRb tumor suppressors, respectively, resulting in uncontrolled cellular proliferation.
Knockdown of E6 and E7 in vitro has been shown to induce apoptosis in both HPV+ cervical cell carcinoma and
HPV+ head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines, indicating that E6 and E7 are viable therapeutic targets
for RNAi therapy. However, the therapeutic application of RNAi requires a delivery platform that can overcome
numerous challenges typically associated with this form of therapy. Peptide carriers show great promise as
siRNA carriers based on the diversity of their physiochemical properties and functions. Recently, we
demonstrated that a novel peptide carrier we designed, termed RD3AD, enhanced the intracellular delivery and
availability of therapeutic, chemically synthesized siRNAs in oral cancer cells, in vitro, to levels that were ~4x
that of Lipofectamine 3000, which some would consider to be the “gold standard” positive control for in vitro
delivery of nucleic acids. It therefore stands to reason that RD3AD could be an effective delivery vehicle for
siRNAs designed to target the E6 and E7 viral oncogenes (siE6 and siE7) in HNSCC cells. RD3AD-siRNA
complexes were also observed to localize to cellular projections identified as filopodia. These observations were
indicative of patterns previously reported for cellular uptake of viruses, bacteria, activated receptors,
lipo/polyplexes, and exosomes, which utilized filopodia to undergo retrograde transport toward the cell, resulting
in significant enhancements of uptake. It is therefore possible, given the observations with RD3AD, that this
peptide is exploiting similar mechanisms. Thus, our overarching hypothesis is that RD3AD-siE6/7 (siE6 or
siE7) complexes enter HPV+ oral cancer cells after binding to cellular filopodia and silence viral
oncogenic E6 or E7 mRNA, in vitro. We will test our hypothesis through the following specific aims. Aim 1:
Identify the RD3AD receptor on filopodia and exploit this receptor for cell specific targeting. Aim 2:
Determine the mechanism(s) of RD3AD-siRNA complex uptake. In aggregate, this proposal will establish a
molecular therapeutic option for HPV+ HNSCCs, while describing a novel mechanism of cell-specific delivery
and uptake by a peptide nanocarrier. The results from this study will contribute significantly to a solution for a
critical unmet clinical need and will be particularly impactful on the field of drug delivery while providing new
insights into filopodia biology. This fellowship will also provide training in drug delivery and cancer biology and
will foster the development of the trainee into a unique oral health academic clinician/scientist."
10805395,"Project Summary/Abstract
Temporomandibular disorders affecting the muscles of mastication (TMDM) are the most prevalent group of
chronic orofacial pain conditions. TMDM chronic pain arising from the masseter muscle (MM) is common. My
long-term goals are to elucidate the underlying mechanisms controlling the development of TMDM chronicity
and to understand the function and TMDM-induced plasticity of neurons innervating the MM. I recently
demonstrated that the MM of mice and primates is predominantly innervated by myelinated A-fibers with unique
electrophysiological characteristics and receptor compositions. To further unravel the identity of these neurons
we performed single-cell RNA sequencing and have identified unique types of neurons that innervate the MM.
Selective markers can be used for specific manipulation of activities for these neuronal clusters. The main
objective of this proposal is to define the contribution of MM innervating TG neuronal groups in the progress of
TMDM chronicity. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that neurons innervating the MM have specialized
neuron type-dependent distinct contributions in the development of TMDM chronicity and undergo
unique plasticity of mechano-gated responses during TMDM. To test this hypothesis, our newly developed
clinically relevant model of chronic masseteric muscle pain (myalgia) in mice will be employed. Aim 1 will define
the contribution of different types of neurons innervating the MM in the development of TMDM by measuring
mechanical hypersensitivity using grimace scores, von Frey, conditioned place avoidance, and bite force. To do
this, we will exploit the availability of transgenic mouse lines and our single-cell data for manipulation of neuronal
activities for specific groups of TG neurons innervating MM. Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by
Designer Drugs (DREADD) will be used to inhibit neuronal activities. Aim 2 will examine the impact of TMDM
on mechano-gated responses in neuronal groups innervating the MM. Our single-cell RNA sequencing data
indicates that neuronal groups innervating MM all express the mechanically gated PIEZO-2 channel but at
considerably different levels. We hypothesize that neurons innervating the MM have distinct neuron type-
dependent responses to mechanical stimuli, and TMDM-driven plasticity. Whole-cell patch-clamp
electrophysiology will be used to investigate mechano-gated current properties in different TG neuronal groups
innervating MM in naïve and TMDM mice at the initiation of pain. Finally, using in vivo imaging, regulation of
different mechanical modalities by TMDM condition will be assessed. The results from this proposal will have a
positive impact by outlining novel therapeutic strategies and candidate targets for the prevention and treatment
of debilitating masticatory myalgia."

 2 Interactions among the microbiota within human microbiome are what define the community function during
 3 healthy homeostasis and changes in these relationships can result in increased virulence leading to disease.
 4 Bacteria from different species in the oral cavity make up the diverse plaque biofilms and are well known to
 5 recognize and bind each other when grown together or artificially mixed (aggregation). Many studies rely on this
 6 model to determine how cell-cell interactions affect each member. However, a major limitation to understanding
 7 how direct binding between microbes may regulate expression within a simple dual bacteria:bacteria interaction
 8 is the fact that there are mixed cell states within the co-culture. In reality, there is not a controlled 1:1 relationship,
 9 and not all cells within the culture are directly bound to another cell. Many cells will remain free but still influenced
10 by soluble metabolites and signals in the shared media environment. When bulk transcriptomics are applied to
11 measure the gene expression of such mixed cultures, the average expression of all the cell states together
12 generates noise that interferes with the true signal of interest – what is occurring in specific biological states,
13 such as cells that are attached to each other. This results in a high probability that a true positive will be
14 missed and the inability to confidently attribute observed changes to the cells of interest. Ultimately this problem
15 represents a universal issue in all microbiology that has largely been ignored to date mainly due to the
16 technological limitations of physically capturing only the cells of interest as well as the biological limitation of low
17 bacterial mRNA content. Here we propose to leverage a recent breakthrough in single-cell transcriptomics
18 (scRNAseq) that has been developed for prokaryotes and successfully applied to monocultures and artificially
19 mixed non-interacting bacteria (MPI Kuchina et al., Science 2021), designated MicroSPLiT (microbial split-pool
20 ligation transcriptomics). MicroSPLiT was achieved through overcoming major challenges specific to bacteria,
21 such as their low mRNA content, diversity in cell size, and cell wall architecture. This technique is designed to
22 be high throughput, profiling tens of thousands of cells in a single experiment, low-cost, and importantly, an
23 approach achievable by any lab with only basic laboratory equipment. The goal of this study is to leverage and
24 expand upon this very recent, highly innovative breakthrough to: 1) Overcome a major universal problem in
25 microbiology by developing a comprehensive approach to determine true cell-cell binding interactions at the
26 single-cell level, and 2) apply this technique to gain insight into several important interactions between oral
27 microbial species including known periopathogens and those between recently discovered ultrasmall, reduced
28 genome parasitic oral bacteria and their bacterial host. Overall, the outcomes of this project are expected to
29 directly advance our understanding of the regulation of genes between physically interacting microbiota and
30 develop a protocol for the research community to be able to utilize this new widely accessible approach.

Insulin secretion from pancreatic β cells is crucial to maintaining blood glucose homeostasis, allowing cells
throughout the body to take up glucose from the blood and obtain nutrients for normal cellular processes. In
type 2 diabetes, however, peripheral tissues become insulin resistant, β cells over-secrete insulin to
compensate, and eventually β cells become dysfunctional. It is therefore necessary to thoroughly understand
the mechanisms of insulin secretion in order to identify potential therapeutic targets for type 2 diabetes
treatment. Insulin secretion is known to predominantly occur at the vascular face of the β cell, at regions
termed “hot spots.” Hot spots are characterized by proteins common to the active zone of neurons as well as
proteins of cortical microtubule-stabilizing complexes and focal adhesions. Our laboratory has also found that
microtubule destabilization promotes insulin secretion specifically at hot spots. Others have shown that the
actin cytoskeleton also plays a critical regulatory role in insulin secretion. Given the known connections of
microtubules, focal adhesions, and actin with known hot spot proteins, it is likely that the interplay of these
cytoskeletal elements is essential for the hot spot organization and function. I therefore hypothesize that insulin
secretion hot spots are “secreting adhesions”: mechanosensitive subcellular domains which use cytoskeletal
regulation to accomplish directed and clustered secretion. My specific aims are to 1) characterize the
cytoskeleton networks, their interplay, and other hot spot components in β cells; and to 2) test if MT-
regulated RhoA-dependent contractility promotes clustered secretion via secreting adhesion
assembly. To address these aims, I will use high- and super-resolution fixed and live-cell imaging techniques
combined with computational analyses. Improving the understanding of hot spot identity and establishment via
the cytoskeleton will contribute to overall knowledge of insulin secretion, and potentially uncover novel targets
for diabetes therapeutics."

conduct high quality research in the early intervention and treatment of alcohol problems. Second, we strive to
provide fellows with rigorous interdisciplinary training in addiction science and grant writing through a
combination of didactic and practical training and individualized mentorship from leading researchers and
clinical scientists. And third, we ensure fellows reach their own individual scientific career objectives by tailoring
training opportunities to their unique goals and needs. From its inception, distinctive features of our program
include its interdisciplinary nature, focus on training in early intervention and treatment of alcohol misuse along
a continuum with attention to crucial health disparities, and emphasis on highly individualized opportunities to
develop competitive grant applications and by doing so, contribute new knowledge about alcohol-related
dysfunction and treatment. The fellowship emphasizes that intervention should be guided by sophisticated and
fully developed theory that considers biological, social, and cultural influences and contexts. We also stress the
importance of integrating theory, research, and the latest technologies to advance prevention and intervention
strategies across development. Fellows gain expertise in the most rigorous and precise experimental and
clinical trial methods, and learn the most cutting edge and powerful statistical techniques. Across all training
activities, we emphasis responsible conduct of research and the importance of scientific rigor and

Predictive analytic algorithms built on electronic health record (EHR) inputs, such as patient characteristics,
administrative codes, and lab values, are increasingly used in health care settings to direct resources to high-
risk patients. Data play an indispensable role in the development and deployment of effective predictive models.
The greatest, yet understudied, challenge in the maintenance of these tools arises from a data-related concern,
namely dataset shift, in which training data distribution differs from the population on which the algorithm is
deployed, leading to model deterioration and inaccurate risk predictions. Dataset shift is a pervasive cause of
algorithmic unreliability in EHR-based models due to inevitable changes in physician behaviors and health
system operations that alter (1) the input distribution (covariate drift); and (2) changes in the relationship between
predictors and outcome (concept drift). Sudden changes in healthcare utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic
may have impacted the data generation process and the performance of clinical predictive models. Our
preliminary study showed that decreased collection of patient labs during the COVID-19 quarantine period led
to sparse data generation for important predictors of a single-institution EHR-based mortality risk prediction
algorithm, underpredicting risk for patients with advanced cancers. Despite the increasing use of predictive tools
in high stakes clinical applications; and growing recognition of dataset shift, we lack a framework for reasoning
shift and its effects on care delivery; and for proactively addressing shift to maintain performance over time. In
Aim 1, we propose to extend prior works on shift to a nationally deployed risk prediction algorithm, the VA Care
Assessment Need (CAN) model, used on millions of VA beneficiaries each year. The VA CAN model predicts
the likelihood of hospitalization within 90 days or 1 year after a primary care encounter to identify high-risk
patients who would benefit from additional outpatient interventions. We also investigate covariate and concept
drift as two possible mechanisms for COVID-19 associated dataset shift. In Aim 2, we apply an interrupted time
series design to study the association between sudden shift at the onset of the pandemic on case-management
decisions. Current solutions to address dataset shift have primarily been reactive (i.e. model retraining with
recent data), however, fail to be robust in new testing environments. In Aim 3, we consider revision of the VA
CAN model via machine learning and inclusion of variables that reflect potential drivers of shift. This project is
innovative as it is the first to leverage a rigorous statistical framework to study extent and mechanisms of shift
and develop proactive guidelines for model maintenance. The training plan is rigorous for Ms. Kolla, an MD-PhD
student in biostatistics. She is strongly supported by her department and institution as well as her two high-
qualified sponsors: Dr. Jinbo Chen, an expert in EHR-based risk prediction modeling, and Dr. Ravi Parikh, an
expert in implementation of predictive analytics. The proposed research and career development plan will be an
essential step towards Ms. Kolla’s development as an interdisciplinary and independent physician-scientist."
10935945,"ABSTRACT
The accumulation of insoluble and misfolded proteins is commonly associated with degeneration of neurons in
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) patients. Heat shock proteins (HSPs)
play a central role in the regulation of protein homeostasis by facilitating effective folding, trafficking, and
degradation of both nascent and aged polypeptides. While it has become increasingly clear that perturbations in
in the proteostasis network play a significant role in ALS/FTD, limited emphasis has been placed on investigating
the direct causal relationship between the functionality of HSPs and disease pathogenesis. Heterozygous, loss-
of-function mutations in the DNAJC7 gene, which encodes for the HSP40 protein DNAJC7 have recently been
identified as a cause for rare forms of ALS. The DNAJC7 protein acts as a co-chaperone for HSP70 chaperones,
thereby facilitating HSP70-polypeptide interactions and appropriate polypeptide folding. However, little is known
about the specific function of DNAJC7 in the central nervous system and motor neurons specifically, the cell type
that predominantly degenerates in ALS patients. Our primary hypothesis is that DNAJC7 haploinsufficiency leads
to the accumulation of misfolded HSP70 client proteins resulting in the disruption of biological processes critical
to the function and survival of vulnerable MNs. Here, we will use mutant DNAJC7 cellular models, patient induced
pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived spinal motor neurons (MNS) and CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing, in combination
with mass spectrometry (MS)-based quantitative proteomics and RNA-Sequencing to elucidate how ALS/FTD-
associated mutations in DNAJC7 contribute towards neuronal dysfunction and degeneration. In Aim 1, which is
based on our preliminary finding that DNAJC7 interacts with the ALS-causal RNA metabolism protein MATR3,
we will determine if pathogenic mutations in DNAJC7 impede MATR3 folding. Next, we will investigate the
functional consequences of disruptions in DNAJC7-substrate interface by measuring how DNAJC7 mutations
affect MATR3-associated RNA processing in patient MNs. In Aim 2, which is based on our preliminary finding
that DNAJC7 impedes the HSF1 response, we will define the mechanistic role DNAJC7 plays in the HSF1-
mediated stress response in patient derived mutant and isogenic control MNs. We will directly measure DNAJC7-
dependent loss of HSF1 transcriptional activity upon stress, determine if DNAJC7 is involved in the dissociation
of the inhibitory HSP70-HSF1 complex, and methodically characterize disruptions in protein solubility caused by
pathogenic DNAJC7 using MS-based proteomics approaches. Taken together, our proposed aims will shed light
upon the cellular mechanisms that are compromised by DNAJC7 haploinsufficiency. Our findings will impact the
field by contributing towards the understanding of HSP-dependent proteostasis mechanisms in human neurons
as well as to how rare ALS genetic mutations lead to neuron dysfunction and loss. Identifying novel proteins that
are susceptible to misfolding in human neurons might highlight cellular pathways critical for ALS/FTD
pathophysiology."
10795105,"Discovery of a pigment produced by Streptococcus pyogenes
Abstract
This proposal seeks to advance a new observation that the human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes (Group
A Streptococcus, GAS) produces a pigment that has gone unreported. We hypothesize the pigment protects
GAS from host-derived and/or environmental stressors (such as reactive oxygen species) and likely enhances
its fitness and potentially augments its virulence. For 80 years, no reference in the literature exists of a pigment
being produced by this important organism, and prior to that, only two citations allude to such a factor. We
suspect this property has been overlooked because its presence only becomes apparent in the laboratory after
culturing in a chemically defined medium, grown to high cell densities, and after exposure to oxygen.
Understanding if and how the production of a pigment could boost the fitness of GAS could provide a new
target that therapeutics or vaccines could take aim upon. The objectives of this proposal are to elucidate the
composition and structure of the GAS pigment, to identify genes associated with its production and regulation,
and to characterize its ability to protect GAS from stressors and immune cell killing while exploring any
cytotoxic properties."

(HSF1). Critical to the nCPC’s clinical success will be determining their mechanism of myocardial recovery. We
have recently reported a head to head comparison between aCDCs and aCPCs that demonstrated that aCPCs

advantage of principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares regression analysis (PLSR), we
identified potentially impactful miRNA signatures within aCPCs–derived circulating EXOs that drives
mechanisms of repair in the injured myocardium involving at least two important processes: antifibrosis and
increased angiogenesis. For these reasons, we believe that miRNA profiling of transplanted progenitor cell–
derived EXOs isolated from recipient plasma more accurately predicts the clinical outcomes seen with stem cell
therapy than the RNA profiles of cultured progenitor cells or their EXOs. However, the direct role of the identified
miRNAs within transplanted CPCs have not yet been determined in vivo, how the plasma miRNAs change
during the post-operative period after cell transplantation, and finally the validity of this methodology and
computational modeling in a large preclinical animal model. Thus, we hypothesize that the plasma EXOs
reflects specific molecular pathways triggered by the parent transplanted progenitor cells that recovers
the injured myocardium. Aim1 will validate whether angiogenesis and antifibrosis mIRs predicted by
computational modeling for CPCs are essential for recovering the ischemic myocardium. Aim 2 will determine
how the circulating EXOs mIR composition changes post-operatively by computational modeling. Aim3 will
expand the predictive capacity of our computational model using transplanted nCPCs in a large animal preclinical
porcine MI model. Successful completion will demonstrate that the use of progenitor cells derived from neonatal
tissue has the highest regenerative abilities which maybe critical for the clinical success. In addition, we will
determine a new paradigm for a more quantitative methodology for cell based therapies to reveal a noninvasive
window into the conditional state of the transplanted cells. Collectively, these findings will demonstrate the
potential of circulating progenitor cell–specific exosomes as a liquid biopsy that provides a noninvasive window
into the conditional state of the transplanted neonatal CPCs. These data implicate the surveillance potential of
cell-specific exosomes for other allogeneic cell based therapies."

Altered auditory feedback is a powerful tool for studying articulatory and prosodic control and understanding
how atypical speech motor control may contribute to speech and voice impairment. This tool is often used to
study sensorimotor adaptation, an important speech motor learning process and a central component of
theories of speech motor control. Yet a traditional altered auditory feedback paradigm involves a speaker in
isolation. This method does not capture speech motor control in typical interactions in which the speaker’s goal
is to convey a message to a listener. A listener can exert considerable influence over a speaker in terms of
word choice and sentence structure, but the effect of the listener on motor control of articulation and prosody
has not been investigated. Articulation and prosody are crucial for effective communication, yet commonly
impaired in communication disorders. They also differ in important ways. For example, altering a single
articulatory feature like the first vowel formant (F1) elicits a response in only that feature, but altering a single
prosodic feature like fundamental frequency (fo) can elicit a response in other prosodic cues. Prosodic cues like
fo, sound pressure level, and rate can be traded to reach the prosodic target, but such flexibility is less
available for producing articulatory features. Given these differences in control mechanisms and target
specificity for articulation and prosody, the listener may exert unequal influences on these systems. The central
hypothesis of this study is that sensorimotor adaptation in both articulation and prosody will be affected by a
listener, but that the listener effect will differ between these two speech subsystems. This hypothesis will be
tested through two specific aims: 1) to determine the effect of the listener on sensorimotor adaptation in
articulation and prosody; and 2) to compare listener effects on strength and specificity of articulatory and
prosodic adaptation. Forty adults will complete sensorimotor adaptation tasks with and without a listener.
Altered auditory feedback will be applied during the first word of sentences spoken during these tasks.
Articulatory manipulations of F1 will shift /ɛ/ toward /ɪ/; prosodic manipulations of fo will shift emphatic stress
toward neutral. A listener, when present, will respond to the speaker in a way that either confirms or contradicts
the self-corrections of speech errors elicited by the altered auditory feedback. The proposed work has
theoretical significance, as it will extend theories of speech motor control to ecologically valid interactions. The
project has clinical significance through its potential to identify intervention targets for those with impaired self-
monitoring of speech or atypical sensorimotor adaptation. It will inform interventions using external feedback to
bolster an impaired self-monitoring system that may underlie articulatory and prosodic deficits."

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a progressive metabolic liver disease characterized by persistent liver
injury, inflammation, and fibrosis. Reprogramming of intrahepatic signaling and liver microenvironment is a
hallmark of NASH pathogenesis in mice and humans. However, the molecular nature of pathophysiological
signaling that drives NASH progression remains an important unsolved question. To address this critical
knowledge gap, we performed bulk and single-cell transcriptomic analysis on healthy and diet-induced NASH
mouse livers. Our work revealed several transcriptomic signatures of NASH, liver cell heterogeneity and
reprogramming during disease pathogenesis, and the landscape of intercellular crosstalk in the liver.
Importantly, key features of NASH-associated reprogramming of the liver microenvironment and intrahepatic
signaling in mice are notably conserved in human NASH. Hepatocytes respond to metabolic stresses in NASH
by engaging adaptive and maladaptive signaling pathways that ultimately lead to liver steatosis and hepatocyte
injury. In preliminary studies, we observed that hepatic expression of the truncated isoform of Tropomyosin
receptor kinase B (TrkB), TrkB-T1, but not the full-length TrkB isoform, was selectively and markedly
upregulated in mouse and human NASH. However, whether and how aberrant activation of hepatic TrkB-T1
signaling contributes to NASH pathogenesis has not been explored. Based on a body of preliminary data, we
hypothesize that pathogenic activation of TrkB-T1 signaling sensitizes hepatocytes to stress-induced injury. In
this proposal, we plan to investigate the role of TrkB-T1 in liver injury and NASH progression. We will explore
cell-intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms that mediate the effects of TrkB-T1 on NASH pathogenesis. Finally, we
will explore the therapeutic potential of targeting this pathway for NASH treatment. Successful completion of
this project will provide novel insights into the pathophysiology of NASH and generate critical preclinical data
that will guide future translational work."

This proposal details a five-year research and career development plan for Jeremy E. Orr, M.D., a specialist in
pulmonology and critical care medicine, and Assistant Professor of Medicine at the University of California, San
Diego. His research has been supported by a National Research Service Award fellowship and currently an
American Thoracic Society Foundation award. The overall focus of his research is understanding the importance
of breathing issues during sleep in patients using chronic opioid medications, and identifying treatment strategies
for these complex breathing issues that will improve health. This K23 award will provide necessary support for
Dr. Orr to gain expertise in patient-oriented clinical research, applied physiology of sleep disordered breathing,
and clinical trials. Dr. Orr has assembled a comprehensive team of mentors to support his research and career
development. His primary mentor, Dr. Atul Malhotra, is a world expert in sleep disordered breathing (SDB) and
applied respiratory physiology, with a strong track record of mentoring and promoting junior faculty to become
independent investigators. Dr. Robert Owens is a NIH-funded physician-scientist with expertise in advanced
techniques to measure SDB physiology, and will serve as a “hands-on” co-mentor. Additional members of the
team are Dr. Sonia Jain (statistics and trials), Dr. Mark Wallace (opioids and pain), Dr. Shamim Nemati (signal
analysis), and Dr. Frank Powell (control of breathing). Patients with chronic pain who use chronic opioids are at
increased risk for poor health including ongoing pain, poor sleep, decreased quality of life, and an increased risk
of mortality. Opioids are known to have effects on breathing which may lead to SDB, an under-recognized factor
potentially contributing to adverse outcomes in these patients. SDB contributes to sleep disruption and
impairments in oxygen levels, but has been little studied in this high-risk group of patients using opioids. In a
broad group of subjects with chronic pain who use chronic opioids, this research will determine whether treatment
of SDB with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) leads to improved sleep quality, as well as investigating
other symptoms including pain in these patients (Aim 1). CPAP treatment may not be effective in some patients
due to unstable breathing (due to opioids), so techniques to identify such individuals will be investigated,
including new measures of breathing instability. For patients with persistent SDB despite CPAP, treatment
options are limited. The research will evaluate whether a medication (acetazolamide) that helps to reduce the
instability of breathing will help to resolve SDB (Aim 2). This research will provide Dr. Orr with a strong foundation
to become an independent investigator studying the impact, pathogenesis and treatment of SDB in those using
chronic opioids."

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes are leading causes of death among adults in the US,
with incident disease following years of accumulating risk conferred through various metabolic
pathways (obesity, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance), immune factors (e.g., systemic
inflammation), and rising blood pressure. The pathogenesis of CVD and cardiometabolic health
begins in childhood, thus it is imperative to identify factors that contribute to emerging
cardiometabolic health disparities. Like other chronic diseases, CVD and diabetes track a
socioeconomic gradient, with greater lifelong health risk among individuals born into
disadvantaged circumstances. However, no prospective studies have carefully characterized
links between early socioeconomic disadvantage and adult health, addressing whether poverty
during particular developmental stages is especially harmful and delineating developmentally
salient risk factors that may link economic disadvantage to cardiometabolic disease (CMD) risk.
Guided by the family stress framework, we propose that family-, school- and community-level
factors during critical phases of development are pathways through which socioeconomic
disadvantage in childhood shapes cardiometabolic health. We also consider the role of child-
based protective factors that might buffer the effects of poverty on adult health outcomes.
Finally, we explore how race and SES intersect to shape risk for CMD in adulthood and whether
adult health behaviors are pathways through which economic disadvantage gives rise to greater
propensity for CMD. The project will assess the cardiovascular health of a diverse sample of 248
adult men (aged 31-33 years) who participated in the Pittsburgh Mother & Child Project
(PMCP). The parent project recruited a sample of 310 toddlers from low income families and
has followed them closely to early adulthood, permitting a comprehensive assessment of risk
and protective factors. We will consider whether these factors relate to biomarkers of
cardiometabolic health risk and preclinical markers of CVD – carotid intima media thickness
and pulse wave velocity. By testing novel contextual pathways at the family, school, and
neighborhood levels this investigation will help to identify contexts that can be targeted by
programs and policies aimed at reducing socioeconomic disparities in adult health."

The Biospecimen Core is essential for the acquisition of all biospecimens, verification of “normal healthy tissue”
diagnosis, processing and allocation of all tissue and associated biofluids/non-tissue specimens required for
SCENT. Integration of multiple, well-established Duke institutions with highly specialized collaborative
capabilities is a unique strength of this Core. We are a nationally recognized biorepository and one of the highest
organ transplantations centers in the country. Biobanking activities occur in parallel with standard of care
biopsies, scheduled surgical procedures, autopsies and organ donor procurements. The objective of this Core
is to provide biospecimen services with exceptional quality control measures to enable tissue mapping of cellular
senescence biomarkers in normal healthy tissues across the lifespan (fetal/perinatal to elderly). This Core will
be led by a team with expertise in autopsy, organ donor and surgical tissue procurement. To accomplish our
goals, we will work to 1) efficiently identify, procure and verify diagnoses of high-quality normal healthy tissue
and concurrent biofluids/non-tissue specimens based on stringent criteria, 2) process high-quality normal healthy
tissues for correlative analyses and 3) ensure quality assurance and quality controls for sample management,
specimen tracking and biobanking informatics management for optimal banked tissue sharing for all SenNet
funded institutions. Our long-term goal is to constantly evolve to meet the needs of our investigators, either
through regulatory modifications, logistical modifications, additions to the service menu, or in creating solutions
to challenging research problems."

We propose to establish an integrative graduate training program in Neural Interfacing to enhance
significantly the depth and breadth of interdisciplinary education and training of the next generation of scientific
and technical leaders in this important, emerging field. The proposed program is motivated by the notion that
future breakthroughs in neural interfacing research will be made by engineers who innovate neural interfacing
technologies with a deep understanding of the fundamental issues and principles of brain science, and who have
had hands-on experience in the application of neural interfacing technology in a real-world biological setting,
aiming at ultimate clinical applications. The proposed program will train doctoral students with quantitative
engineering backgrounds to: 1) Develop the technological and theoretical foundations to understand brain
function and dysfunction through neural interfacing, i.e., through sensing, modeling, decoding, and modulating
brain dynamics at circuit, network, and whole brain levels, 2) Advance our understanding of brain function in the
domains of learning, motor control, perception and cognition, and determine and quantify the adaptive changes
of the brain that occur in a novel environment, when interacting with a machine, or when in an altered, diseased
state, and 3) Innovate brain sensing, modeling, decoding, and modulation technologies, based both on
quantifiable behavioral or perceptual outcomes and on the adaptive changes occurring in the brain during a
neural intervention. Our predoctoral fellows will be trained through an array of mechanisms including a newly
proposed Neuroengineering Minor, a Practicum of Neural Interfacing course consisting of 8~12 mini-lab-rotations,
in-depth research rotations, thesis co-advisors, weekly training activities including seminars and colloquia, and
training in career skills development and responsible conduct of research. An advisory system will help guide
students through the program. Our program will lower the barriers to interdisciplinary, convergent research by
training students with quantitative backgrounds to possess integrative expertise in multiple fields so that, going
forward, these students can serve as catalysts for the cross-fertilization of engineering with neuroscience in the
next generation. Our trainees will be well prepared for academic and industrial challenges, be competitive
candidates for academic, industry and government careers, and be at the forefront of translating scientific
findings and engineering and computational technology development into industrial and clinical settings. It is
anticipated that trainees of the proposed training program will become future leaders through neurotechnology
innovations that enhance, measure and modulate, and ultimately heal our brain through neural interfaces."

10916307,"SUMMARY: To grow and proliferate, cells need to fulfill three key metabolic demands: increased biosynthesis,
sufficient energy supply, and maintenance of redox homeostasis. The latter demand is particularly important for
sustained growth, because increased rate of cellular metabolic activity during cell proliferation results in elevated
levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can have detrimental effects on cell growth. Nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) is a principal supplier of reducing power for biosynthesis of
macromolecules and protection against oxidative stress. The total cellular pool of NADPH is regulated by the
activity of NAD kinases (NADK), enzymes that catalyze the phosphorylation of NAD+ to NADP+, the rate-limiting
substrate for NADPH production. Mammalian cells express two NAD kinases, cytosolic NADK, and mitochondrial
NADK2, which generate compartment-specific reducing power. Recently, we discovered that the activity of
NADK is stimulated by the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) - Akt pathway to boost the NADP(H) production for
cell growth, but the importance of NADK2 and the overall role of mitochondrial NADPH in cell growth has yet to
be established. Mutations in NADK2 have been observed in patients with various neurological and
developmental disorders. Therefore, defining the key functions of NADK2 and mitochondrial NADP(H) is critical
and relevant to human health. This proposal builds on our finding that decreasing mitochondrial NADP(H) levels
through depletion of NADK2 renders cells uniquely proline auxotroph. Cells with NADK2 deletion fail to
synthesize proline and rely on exogenous proline for their growth. Proline is critical for protein synthesis, and,
unexpectedly, for nucleotide synthesis, in NADK2-deficient cells. We propose three Specific Aims to establish
the functions of NADK2 and mitochondrial NADP(H) that are essential for cell growth and proliferation and
relevant for proliferative diseases and NADK2 deficiency in humans. In Aim 1, we propose to define the molecular
mechanisms by which NADK2 and mitochondrial NADPH support proline biosynthesis and evaluate the effects
of NADK2 patient mutations on proline synthesis. In Aim 2, we will determine the mechanisms of how NADK2
deficiency and reduced proline abundance affect flux through the de novo and salvage nucleotide synthesis
pathways. In Aim 3, we will assess the requirement of NADK2 and mitochondrial NADPH for tumor growth and
evaluate the therapeutic potential of targeting NADK2 in combination with dietary restriction of proline. This
proposal will establish the primary functions of mitochondrial NADP(H) and NADK2 that are essential for cell
growth and proliferation, thereby informing us on new therapeutic strategies to combat proliferative diseases and
NADK2 deficiency in humans."
10915473,"Project Summary/Abstract
Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is aggressive and a large percentage of patients develop metastatic
disease. Disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) found in the bone marrow (BM) of TNBC patients may be the
intermediaries of the metastatic process. Data from our lab as well as others suggest that the immune landscape
of BM may influence DTC latency, treatment resistance, and metastatic potential. We have already defined and
validated an 8 gene expression-based biomarker panel that can detect DTCs in the BM of treatment naïve TNBC
patients and that predicts development of distant metastatic disease. Our recent data indicate that TNBC patients
with DTC-positive BM have altered populations of immune cell precursors and this is associated with recurrent
disease development. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that immune checkpoint inhibitors will
facilitate the elimination of BM DTCs in TNBC patients by altering the immune microenvironment in
patients with specific DTC and/or BM immune cell populations, and that cell population-specific gene
expression signatures can predict which patients will benefit most from aggressive immunotherapy to
prevent metastatic disease relapse.
 We will test this hypothesis using our extensive biorepository of BM specimens collected from TNBC patients
who received conventional chemotherapy, as well as prospectively collected specimens from TNBC patients
participating in an independently funded institutional phase II immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) trial of
carboplatin/paclitaxel/nivolumab with or without cabiralizumab. Our goals are: 1. To evaluate the ability of our 8-
gene DTC gene panel to predict distant disease development in TNBC patients enrolled in our ICI therapeutic
trial of carboplatin/paclitaxel/nivolumab with or without cabiralizumab; 2. To understand the specific
subpopulations of BM DTCs in TNBC patients treated with conventional chemotherapy and ICI therapy which
are resistant to therapy, and; 3. To understand alterations in specific T cell and conventional dendritic cell (cDC)
populations in the BM when DTCs are present, and how this is impacted by conventional and ICI therapy. The
results of this proposal will lead to a greater understanding of immune escape and heterogeneity of BM
micrometastatic disease as well as biomarkers for improving conventional and ICI therapy in TNBC patients."
10795056,"Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) is involved etiologically in HIV/AIDS-associated diseases Kaposi's sarcoma,
primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), and multicentric Castleman's disease; in all, viral latent and lytic functions are
believed to contribute. Molecular and mechanistic understanding of the virus-host interactions required for
successful infection and replication is a necessary prerequisite for enabling the development of novel antiviral
and therapeutic agents. HHV-8 encodes four viral interferon regulatory factors (vIRFs), all of which are
expressed during lytic (productive) replication and three of which (vIRFs 1, 2 and 3) are known to be expressed,
to varying degrees, in latently infected PEL cells and to support their viability. The vIRFs have been reported to
interact in inhibitory fashion with various host-cell proteins, mainly involved in defense against virus infection.
However, we and others have demonstrated empirically, via depletion and knockout studies, that vIRFs 2 and 3
suppress HHV-8 replication in PEL and other cell types. Although counterintuitive, such activity may contribute
to overall viral fitness in natural infections, for example by limiting virus production to evade adaptive immune
responses. On the other hand, vIRFs 1 and 4 have been found to promote lytic replication in culture; thus there
is a balance between the replication-regulatory effects of the vIRFs. In the course of phenotypic studies of the
vIRFs, we have identified vIRF-3 as a strong suppressor HHV-8 proteins RTA, required for latent-lytic switching
and lytic replication, and viral interleukin-6 (vIL-6), involved in promoting lytic cycle and implicated in HHV-8-
associated pathogenesis; these phenomena were identified in PEL and (model) iSLK epithelial cells,
respectively. These findings may explain, at least in part, the observed replication-suppressive effects of vIRF-
3. Further to our published identification of vIRF-3:USP7 interaction as important for vIRF-3-mediated inhibition
of HHV-8 replication and promotion of latently-infected PEL cell viability, we have determined that a USP7-
binding motif-containing peptide derivative of vIRF-3 (v3pep) effects substantially enhanced vIRF-3 expression
in latent/lytic PEL cells and lytically-infected iSLK cells and to suppression of lytic replication. The project
proposed in this application will: (1) determine the mechanisms of vIRF-3 regulation of RTA and vIL-6,
distinguishing between transcriptional and posttranscriptional effects and assessing hypothesized direct
targeting by vIRF-3 of vIL-6/RTA promoter, or conceivably RNA, sequences; (2) examine the generality of vIRF-
3 regulation by v3pep in HHV-8-infected cells and involvement of vIRF-3 in the antiviral activity of the novel
peptide. Data from this project will characterize mechanistically a newly identified function of vIRF-3 in lytic gene
regulation and may provide the rationale and basis for future development of v3pep-based small-molecule
antiviral agents, acting via vIRF-3 induction and consequent suppression of RTA, vIL-6 and possibly other lytic
genes essential to virus biology. As HHV-8 is an important oncogenic pathogen in the context of HIV infection,
the proposed research is related and of significance to the fields of HIV coinfections and HIV-associated cancers."

Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) infects a number of different immune cell types with diverse
replication strategies and clinical outcomes. Amongst these, we have a good understanding of infection in T-
Cells, depletion of which results in Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). Moreover, AIDS is now well
controlled using combination anti-retroviral therapy (cART), meaning the duration and quality of life has greatly
increased for many people living with HIV-1. However, an estimated 50% of HIV-1 patients in the US still
develop HIV-1-asssociated dementia (HAND) and other neurocognitive disorders. This is because beyond T-
Cells, HIV-1 also enters the central nervous system (CNS) and establishes a reservoir of infection in brain-
resident macrophages and microglia that is more difficult to treat. In addition, virus replication strategies in
macrophage and microglia differ from those in T-Cells, particularly at late stages, and remain less well
understood. What is clear is that HIV-1 replication in these cells results in secretion of a complex mixture of
host cytokines and other toxic products, as well as viral proteins, each contributing to a neurotoxic environment
that remains intensely studied yet challenging to treat. Understanding how HIV-1 replicates in brain-resident
immune cells and the host factors involved is therefore of high significance and has the potential to guide
future drug design. Our prior work and new preliminary data reveal that Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) is
highly expressed in macrophages and microglia and plays a pivotal role in both regulating HIV-1 infection and
production of neurotoxic compounds by infected cells. APP is a transmembrane protein that is processed
through a non-amyloidogenic (non-toxic) pathway at the plasma membrane or an amyloidogenic pathway
within endolysosomes and multivesicular bodies (MVBs), which produces amyloid proteins that aggregate and
form plaques associated with neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s Disease as well as HAND.
Our data shows that amyloidogenic APP processing and associated formation of a cleavage product termed
C99 functions to restrict HIV-1 replication in macrophages and microglia as well as a number of cell line
models. Specifically, C99 competes with the HIV-1 Gag polyprotein for access to and control of MVB sorting,
suppressing the production and release of new infectious virions. Understanding how APP and C99 function in
more detail will therefore provide important new insights into macrophage/microglia-specific HIV-1 replication
strategies and restrictions. To evade APP activity, Gag competes to direct MVBs to exocytic pathways that
enable virus release but also enhance APP processing and secretion of amyloids. As such, the battle between
APP and Gag determines the overall level of virus replication and amyloid production in infected cells, which
we will explore in Aim 1. Our data also shows that novel compounds termed γ-secretase modulators (GSM’s)
can be used to tilt this battle in favor of the cell by preventing APP processing to simultaneously harness its
activity to inhibit HIV-1 replication and to suppress neurotoxic effects of amyloids, which we will test in Aim 2."
10851877,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), a rare pulmonary vascular disease, was first reported more than 150 years
ago. However, PAH remains incurable, even in this modern era of medicine. A prerequisite to the development of
effective anti-PAH therapeutics is a firmer grasp of the intrinsic and environmental factors that cause the disease,
including the basis of the sex-disparity in PAH−the disease disproportionately affects women. Approaches to
understanding PAH biology and developing PAH drugs have traditionally used various cellular and animal models.
Both have shortcomings in terms of relevance to human PAH, and the use of animal models is burdened with
welfare, lead-time, and cost disadvantages. While traditional models have aided in advancing the field of PAH, none
of the models capture the pathological alterations that occur in the pulmonary arteries of human PAH patients.
Recently, cell-laden microfluidic devices, called “organ- or disease-on-chip”, have been developed to recapitulate
the pathologies of various diseases, but not PAH. In the absence of any such device for PAH, we hypothesized that
a multichannel microfluidic device seeded with three major human pulmonary arterial cells (PACs)−endothelial,
smooth muscle and adventitial cells−could be used as an alternative to traditional models of PAH. In a recent NHLBI-
funded study, we tested this hypothesis by growing three major PACs in a microfluidic device, “PAH-on-a-chip”,
prepared using the elastomer polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). We showed that our PAC-laden device can capture
the major pathologies of PAH, including mis-localized growth of PACs, plexiform lesions, and sex-based differences
in PAH pathology and therapy. However, this PDMS PAH-on-a-chip is limited to small, lab-scale studies because
PDMS is not amenable to large-scale fabrication. PDMS can also affect the experimental outcome by
absorbing/adsorbing various molecules from the circulating fluid or by deforming upon contact with solvents. Thus,
we propose a second-generation PAH-on-a-chip for scale up: one composed of a thermoplastic polymer, cyclic
olefin copolymer (COC), that has superior mechanical properties and optical transmissivity, does not undergo
deformation, and, importantly, is amenable to mass production. We will use a Computer Numerical Control (CNC)
milling machine and injection molding for fabricating the COC chips. Subsequently, we will validate the chip by
seeding PACs and creating various PAH-mimicking pathologies as well as the sex disparity. We will also utilize the
chip for investigating the therapeutic efficacy of anti-PAH medications. This is an extraordinarily innovative study
that will deploy the ingenuity of microfluidic engineering to elucidate the complexity of PAH biology while addressing
the NIH Precision Medicine Initiative and the FDA 2021 Modernization Act. If successful, our mass-produced PAH-
on-a-chip will spur a shift in the experimental tools used to study various types of vascular diseases. The
investigative team, with complementary expertise in microfluidics, PAH pathophysiology, patient care, and business
development, is eminently qualified to accomplish the goals of this project and make this device a scientifically and
commercially viable experimental tool for pulmonary vascular disease research and drug discovery."

treat hypercholesterolemia and steatosis. In the current application we propose to define the
molecular mechanisms through which the compounds act. In preliminary data we show that the
compounds inhibit human carboxylesterase 1 (CES1). In the three proposed aims we will i)
identify the binding characteristics of the compounds to CES1 and define their specificity using
crystallography and biochemical assays, ii) use iPSC-hepatocytes to definitively establish the
role of CES1 in mediating (V)LDL-cholesterol production by the compounds, and iii) determine

End-stage liver disease is associated with morbidity and mortality often requiring a liver transplant. Dysfunction
and capillarization of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) could contribute to impaired hepatic repair and
cirrhosis. Thus, uncovering the mechanisms by which LSECs acquire their specialized functions to support
hepatic repair could enable the development of therapies for scar-free liver repair. We have shown that
activation of Id1 and Cxcr7 in LSECs induce angiocrine factors, that guide hepatic regeneration without
fibrosis. However, the mechanism by which LSECs acquire their pro-hepatic functions is unknown. We show
that while transcription factors (TFs) Fli1 and Erg dictate the vascular fate and homeostasis of LSECs (Gomez-

regenerative functions of LSECs (Gomez-Salinero JM, et al, Cell Stem Cell, 2022). Induction of c-Maf in
generic human endothelial cells (ECs) switches on liver-specific LSEC signatures and angiocrine factors
supporting hepatocyte functionality. In mice in which c-Maf is deleted in adult ECs, recovery from CCl4 results
in fibrosis and LSECs regression to arterial cell fate. Thus, we hypothesize that maintenance of LSEC vascular
cell fate requires constitutive Fli1 or Erg expression, sustaining LSECs homeostatic functions. Induction of c-
Maf enforces specialized pro-regenerative functions and interactions of LSECs with hepatocytes, Kupffer and
stellate cells that prevents stress-induced LSEC arterialization promoting hepatic repair without fibrosis. To this
end, we have reprogrammed human generic ECs to an adaptable tubulogenic state. These Reset-Vascular
Endothelial Cells (R-VECs) self-assemble into a 3D vascular network, transporting human blood and arborizing
hepatocytes (Palikuqi B et al. Nature, 2020). The vascularized hepatic aggregates with stellate and Kupffer
cells within scalable and perfusable microfluidic devices establish a human Hepatic-on-VascularNet platform,
enabling study of physiologically adaptive cross-talk between human hepatocytes and LSECs. This
hypothesis will be tested by performing these Aims: Aim 1: Define the mechanism by which hierarchical Fli1
and Erg expression through c-Maf induction sustains specialization of LSECs at steady state, during hepatic
regeneration and after CCl4 induced liver injury. AIM 2: Uncover the contribution of c-Maf expressed in the
Kupffer cells that by enforcing and sustaining LSEC vascular attributes regulate hepatic homeostasis during
liver regeneration and CCl4 induced liver injury. AIM 3: Employ the human Hepatic-On-VascularNet platform to
uncover the mechanism by which c-Maf is induced functionally in human liver ECs to form specialized LSECs.
Determine whether human c-Maf induced LSECs (iLSECs) can restore hepatic regeneration. Specifically, the
role of infusing human iLSECs in restoring hepatic repair post-acetaminophen (APAP) injury without provoking
fibrosis will be assessed. These studies will uncover the molecular determinants of human LSECs and allow
strategies to employ iLSECs to sustain its pro-regenerative and anti-fibrotic attributes for liver repair."

 The Galbulimima (GB) alkaloids are derived from the bark of the Galbulimima genus,
which features in the traditional medicine and ritual of Papua New Guinea. GB alkaloid content
varies markedly among individual trees, and only some bark samples cause hallucination. The
number of alkaloids contained in the bark and their general scarcity complicate identification of
the biomolecular targets and rigorous pharmacological characterization. Here we describe new
chemical platforms for procurement of each Galbulimima alkaloid, the first new biological targets
identified in over three decades and preliminary interrogation by pharmacology and structural
biology. Viability of the synthetic platform is supported by route that reduce synthetic burden
approximately three-fold.
 The first section of the grant demonstrates gram-scale Class Ia/b GB alkaloid accession
by ligand-controlled cross-electrophile coupling (XEC). This strategy allows modular assembly of
the carbocyclic (decalin) core with a variety of piperidine side-chains—motifs that define GB
alkaloids. Whereas Class Ia targets mAChRs, scaffold rearrangement to Class Ib changes GPCR
selectivity to ORs. Preliminary data suggests oxidized analogs shift OR antagonism toward
agonism; in vivo data demonstrates rapid penetration of the brain to affect mouse behavior. Full
interrogation of pharmacology and structural characterization of ligand-receptor complexes have
begun to identify unique aspects of the ""GB opioids.""
 The second section explores gram-scale syntheses of Class II–IV via conversion of high
fraction aromatic (FAr) scaffolds to high fraction sp3 (Fsp3), stereochemically-rich natural products.
New cross-coupling reactions assemble aromatic feedstocks efficiently; we propose asymmetric
variants to render existing racemic routes enantioselective. Importantly, existing and proposed
routes are highly divergent and allow exploration of how structural variation correlates to
selectivity among a human receptors. We identify another high affinity receptor associated with
antispasmodic alkaloids and propose the syntheses of high-priority bradycardia agents.
 The synthetic platform outlined here combined with advances in robust cell-based second
messenger assays now widely available for the receptor families of interest allow unprecedented
ability to probe structure, function and selectivity of the GB alkaloids. Ultimately, we expect to
identify enough ligand-receptor pairs to begin building a GB alkaloid-receptor interactome to
predict structure-function relationships, supported by high-resolution experimental structures.
This research holds great potential to identify privileged new scaffold leads for therapeutic
development from plant metabolites already validated in humans."
10868655,"ABSTRACT
Infections by different pathogens can manifest with similar symptoms, but appropriate treatment requires specific
and accurate diagnosis. Clinicians often turn to multiplexed assays testing for many organisms (e.g. BioFire).
While these approaches can test for 50-70 organisms, they do not provide concentration titers, which is
necessary to identify the causative pathogen among the several false positives or clinically meaningless
commensals. As a result, the clinician must perform additional tests to identify which of the positives is causative.
Although these tests use quantitative PCR, in clinical labs the results are reported as presence/absence due to
the finicky nature of PCR in this setting, which is sensitive to minor variations in reaction efficiency, operator
variability. As a result, today, only a few widespread PCR tests are FDA approved to report quantitative result.
In contrast to qPCR, digital PCR (dPCR) measures target titers by counting individual molecules. As a result,
dPCR provides an absolute concentration measurement that doesn’t require a standard curve. In addition, the
reaction is cycled to endpoint, then quantified; it does not require careful estimation of the amplification rate,
which is a major source of variability in qPCR. Thus, dPCR is less sensitive to variations in reaction efficiency
and provides superior consistency. However, current dPCR methods are limited in multiplexing, allowing just 5-
6 targets per assay, while qPCR can test up to 100. Moreover, dPCR requires complex microfluidic equipment
that burdens testing lab personnel and increases cost. Until these issues can be addressed, qPCR will continue
to dominate the clinical lab, and quantitative and absolute pathogen load reporting will remain beyond reach.
Here, we propose a novel nucleic acid technology combining the quantitativeness and robustness of dPCR with
the simplicity and multiplexing of qPCR. Our vision is to enable broad spectrum detection wherein each pathogen
is associated with a high confidence, quantitative titer. Our approach – gigapixel PCR (gPCR) – is enabled by
our recent discoveries of self-assembled partitioning, for microfluidic-free generation of monodispersed
emulsions, and linearized target quantitation with capillary electrophoresis (CE). CE allows sensitive quantitation
over 7 decades and provides amplicon length information with single nucleotide resolution. In gPCR, we use this
to perform multiplexed detection of over 100 amplicons per reaction. In contrast to qPCR, which requires that
the sample be split to test for different targets, thereby diluting it and reducing sensitivity, with gPCR the targets
are tested without splitting, maintaining them at maximal concentration, and substantially increasing sensitivity.
Moreover, based on robust dPCR, gPCR provides reproducible, quantitative results across testing conditions. It
thus addresses the major limitations of current dPCR technologies and provides the first viable alternative to
qPCR in the clinic. We will develop and validate the technology against accepted standards (SeraCare), and
work with our longstanding collaborators (Drs. Melanie Ott and Charles Chiu) to apply it to respiratory and CNS
infections from samples previously collected at UCSF hospitals."

Oral diseases (periodontal disease, caries, and xerostomia) have major deleterious effects on long-term health
and quality of life, and are thought to be more prevalent in older adults living with HIV. Despite this, oral and
dental health remains a neglected area of research within the field of HIV and associated clinical care, and is
absent from nearly all HIV clinical guidelines in Sub-Saharan Africa. A demonstrated reciprocal association
between geriatric syndromes and poor oral health that affects quality of life among older people living with HIV
has been well described in the developed world such as the US but not in resource limited settings such as
Uganda. We hypothesize that the combined effects of HIV, frailty, depression, and cognitive decline are risk
factors for poorer oral health and quality of life among older people living with HIV. Our goal is to determine the
impacts of the geriatric syndromes (frailty, depression, and cognitive decline) on oral health and quality of life in
people with HIV, and to explore the mechanisms of integration of oral health services into routine HIV care in
the context of rural Sub-Saharan Africa. The specific aims for this study are: 1a) to determine the contributions
of frailty, neurocognition, and depression as risks to the epidemiology of periodontal disease, dental caries,
and xerostomia among older adults living with and without HIV in Uganda, 1b) to estimate the contributions of
periodontal disease, dental caries and xerostomia to oral and overall health-related quality of life, and 2) to
explore the barriers to and facilitators of integration of oral health services into routine HIV care in Uganda. To
achieve this goal we will leverage the existing clinical research infrastructure/NIH-supported longitudinal cohort
(UGANDAC, R01 AG059504, PI Mark Siedner) study of older adults aged 50 and older living with HIV in
southwestern Uganda and their age and gender-matched HIV uninfected controls. Our proposed research is
unique in that it will be: a) among the first to describe the epidemiology of oral health, the contributions of HIV,
and geriatric syndromes on oral health in Uganda, b) focuses on quality of life and well-being among older
people in a vulnerable, diverse population, and c) uses mixed methods research to both describe the
determinants of poor health and develop interventions to respond to a public health need to improve oral health
in a high-risk population. We have a multidisciplinary team of professional physicians and scientists from Africa
and the US that brings broad expertise in oral, mental, and HIV care and research; epidemiology, biochemistry,
and global population public health to achieve the set independent proposed aims of this application. The
study's findings will show the most frequent oral and dental health problems among Ugandan older individuals
living with HIV, their effects on quality of life, and, most importantly, their determinants. As a result, we will be
in a better position to design an intervention in southwestern Uganda to assess the inclusion of an oral and
dental health preventive and promotion program to routine HIV care. The findings will form the basis for our
applications for an R01 funded clinical trial to design and study this intervention."
10700923,"Idiopathic Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (iNPH) is a reversible form of dementia and gait imbalance in the elderly that has been treated with surgical ventriculoperitoneal shunting (VPS). Although VPS has been performed for decades, the effectiveness of VPS has not been tested in an appropriately run placebo-controlled clinical trial. Due to the lack of data from placebo-controlled trials, skepticism about VPS in the elderly has significantly limited its use. The primary goal of this research proposal is to gather data with the goal of a definitive answer on the question of whether shunt surgery offers a benefit to patients with iNPH. We will accomplish this through a prospective, blinded, randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial that uses a contemporary FDA approved adjustable shunt system. This valve allows a “virtual off” setting allowing for noninvasive and reversible assignment of patients to treatment with a functioning (active group) or non- functioning (placebo group) shunt. The trial will enroll 100 iNPH patients at 20 sites. Participants selected for shunt surgery will be chosen based on standard and widely used iNPH guidelines. The trial is a delayed treatment paradigm where all 100 patients will receive the same surgery and device, differing only in the initial valve setting (active or placebo). The Primary analysis will be a group comparison of change from baseline in gait velocity at three months after implantation. Secondary analysis will measure balance, cognition, and bladder control. Three months after implantation, all participants in both groups are blindly adjusted to the active setting and followed for 9 months. A secondary goal of the study is to evaluate clinical, imaging, and CSF biomarkers before surgery to identify associations with subsequent shunt response. MR imaging and extended neuropsychological testing are also repeated after shunting to evaluate specific anatomical and cognitive domain changes that may be associated with gait changes. We expect that if we demonstrate the effectiveness of shunting in iNPH we will establish an effective treatment and facilitate an increase in appropriate iNPH shunting. In addition, the study of patient biomarkers associated with successful outcomes will allow future testing of algorithms for more accurate and efficient patient selection. Identification of subgroups of iNPH patients with improvement may also be suggested. Data from this controlled trial can ultimately benefit the 300 to 700 thousand iNPH patients in the US to receive an effective surgical treatment. If data shows that shunting is found to be ineffective in the placebo group, elderly patients will be spared the potential morbidity and cost of an ineffective brain surgery."

PROJECT SUMMARY
In 2015, evidence that e-cigarette use (“vaping”) in adolescents and young adults (AYAs) had increased and
was associated with increased risk of cigarette smoking initiation generated concern in the public health community. Subsequent research has left the field with several critical questions, including: (1) whether vaping truly
has a causal effect on smoking or merely reflects a common liability toward deviancy among ‘high-risk’ AYAs
with emotional or behavioral problems, (2) whether an emerging wave of new vaping products, including new
nicotine products such as JUUL, and an increasingly diverse class of products dedicated to vaping cannabis
plant, oils, and waxes, may increase the appeal and addictive potential of vaping, and (3) whether there exist
particular characteristics of vaping products and biopsychosocial mechanisms that underlie the risk of AYA vaping initiation, progression, and transition to other forms of drug use that could be targeted in prevention efforts.
The uncertainties regarding the impact of AYA vaping have left policy officials with little evidence to determine if
AYA vaping should be prioritized in public health programs, and if so, the most effective strategies for prevention.
To address the evidence needs and provide a flexible framework for future study of the impact of various vaping
products on the AYA tobacco product and cannabis use burden, we will test a novel ‘catalyst model’ of AYA
vaping. The catalyst model proposes two steps, which we will evaluate in Aims 1 and 2 of this proposal. Step 1
(AIM 1). To determine whether (a) AYAs with fewer emotional-behavioral risk factors who have been previously
deterred from drug use in traditional (non-vaporized) forms are at risk of vaping initiation, (b) the unique qualities
and product features of vaping (e.g., concealability, flavors, appealing technology, social acceptability, low perceived harm) increase risk of AYA vaping, and (c) features of vaping products disproportionately increase the
risk of vaping initiation for low-risk AYAs. Step 2 (AIM 2). To determine whether (a) vaping increases the risk of
cross-product transitions involving initiation of other vaping products, or combustible nicotine or cannabis, as
well as increases risk of progression to problematic drug use outcomes, including dependence, poly-drug use,
and chronic drug use through early adulthood, (b) rewarding effects from exposure to nicotine, cannabinoids,
and other product components (e.g. flavorings) increases risk of cross-product transitions and problematic drug
use outcomes, and (c) product characteristics modify this association. To test the model, we will leverage data
collected from participants from age 14-19 (2013-2018) from our existing cohort and follow participants into early
adulthood (20-23, from 2019-2023; N~2000). We will also recruit a new cohort of 9th grade students at age 14
(N=2500) at the same schools as part of a cohort-sequential design that will apply causal inference analytic
approaches to determine whether observed associations are likely causal. Collectively, this project will provide
critical information regarding the priority and potential targets of public health efforts aimed at reducing the potential adverse public health effects resulting from AYA vaping, including tobacco-related cancer."

Despite advances in the treatment of ocular diseases, vision-threatening disease or eye injury remain the top 10
disabilities among adults. Several of these ocular conditions require an anterior chamber paracentesis (ACP).
ACP is clinically indicated to reduce acutely elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) to avoid risk of permanent vision
loss and to sample aqueous humor for disease diagnostics and monitoring. Conditions requiring IOP reduction
include acute angle closure glaucoma, pneumatic retinopexy to treat retinal detachments, and iatrogenic IOP
elevations associated with intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents to
treat diseases such as neovascular age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy and retinal vein
occlusions. Conditions requiring aqueous humor sampling include endophthalmitis, uveitis, retinoblastoma and
lymphoma, and aqueous biomarkers increasingly are guiding treatment selection and drug monitoring, e.g., with
anti-VEGF agents. Unfortunately, there exists no instrument specifically designed for ACP, and instead
tuberculin syringes with standard excessively long needles and limited operational control are used. This requires
a steady surgeon hand and steady patient eye while the patient is positioned in the slit lamp biomicroscope, and
often requires an assistant. As a result, the ACP procedure may lead to serious complications, such as hyphema
and cataract due to inadvertent trauma to intraocular structures (e.g., cornea, ciliary body, iris and lens), and the
aspiration rate and aqueous volume are difficult to control and unpredictable. Unfortunately, there have been no
improvements in the safety or efficiency of ACP in the past century. To overcome the limitations associated with
existing antiquated techniques, F Square Medical is developing and commercializing Parasafe™, the first-ever
instrument designed specifically for ACP procedures. The Parasafe instrument is a sterile, disposable and
importantly, safe instrument for controlled, rapid, and reproducible ACP without requiring a slit lamp or an
assistant. Through the completion of a successful Phase I project, F Square Medical built a functional alpha
prototype and assessed its performance and usability to inform beta prototype refinement. This Phase II program
will build upon the substantial Phase I data package and will focus on incorporating feedback from the Phase I
end-user data to refine and lock the Parasafe design for manufacture, as well as execute on the complete array
of required design control activities per 21 CFR 820.30 to advance Parasafe to FDA regulatory 510(k)
submission, approval, and scalable production. The completion of the proposed Phase II project will result in the
filing of a 510(k) regulatory submission to the FDA for Parasafe, an instrument with the potential to significantly
reduce the risk and expand the utility of ACP, thereby advancing this transformational instrument toward
commercialization and improving patient care."

Trethera, a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company, has developed a small molecule drug, TRE-515, to target
the nucleoside salvage pathway via a key rate-limiting enzyme, deoxycytidine kinase (dCK). We have shown
that dCK is expressed at high levels in a variety of solid tumors, and TRE-515 selectively targets cancer cells
based on their high expression of, and dependence on, dCK. Notably, TRE-515 is the only salvage pathway
inhibitor currently in clinical development, and no salvage pathway inhibitors are approved as cancer
therapeutics. Currently, Trethera is evaluating TRE-515 in a phase 1a open-label, dose escalation study in
patients with solid tumors (IND #131939). Acceptable safety and tolerability have been demonstrated across
three TRE-515 doses (40mg, 80mg, 160mg) in 10 patients. Preliminary pharmacokinetic (PK) data indicate an
acceptable half-life, rapid absorption, and low variability among patients, and early and pharmacodynamic (PD)
data demonstrate effective target inhibition. Notably, early signs of anti-tumor activity have been noted, with 50%
of patients in the lowest dose cohorts showing stable disease. Our goal here is to perform a Phase 1 dose
expansion trial deploying a quantitative LC/MS based assay to determine serum
deoxycytidine (dC)/
deoxyuridine
(dU) levels and a novel PET imaging approach as complementary biomarkers to monitor drug activity and assess
preliminary antitumor activity. Whole-body dCK activity regulates the levels of serum dC and its metabolite dU,
and reductions in dCK activity via TRE-515 inhibition can be routinely monitored by measuring changes in plasma
dC/dU using an LC-MS assay we developed. [18F]CFA is a PET radiotracer that can be used to non-invasively
measure dCK activity in tumors (IND #133911). As accepted by the FDA, male and female patients (N=12) with
advanced refractory solid tumors will be administered 320 mg TRE-515 as a once daily oral dose. The LC/MS
based assay to measure serum dC/dU levels will be further developed and used as an easily accessible
biomarker to assess patient response to TRE-515 (Aim 1). Biomarker studies using the recently invented, IND-
accepted positron emission tomography (PET) probe, [18F]Clofarabine ([18F]CFA), will be used for in vivo
monitoring of the effects of TRE-515 on dCK activity (Aim 2). Safety assessments, biomarker studies, and
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) will be used to assess tumor responses in patients. Trial
milestones include i) >1.5X increases in serum levels of dC + dU after initiating TRE-515 therapy, reflecting drug
target inhibition and ii) greater than 33% reduction in [18F]CFA tumor uptake following TRE-515 treatment.
Success in the proposed trial will support future Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials to determine efficacy, safety,
combinations, patient selection, and optimal dose regimen of TRE-515."
10834072,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Although immunotherapy, especially immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, has rapidly
become the fourth pillar in cancer therapy with increasing breakthrough advances, barriers still exist to its
success. Given their ability to rapidly exert their cytotoxic effects on heterogeneous tumor cells with minimal
adverse events, natural killer (NK) cells have emerged as promising tools to expand the benefits of cancer
immunotherapy, including for patients who never start or stop responding to ICI. However, lack of consistent
responses in human NK cell trials, especially for solid tumors, calls for innovative methods to successfully
translate novel NK immunotherapy approaches to the clinic. Dogs with cancer are an excellent way to assess
novel immunotherapies because they recapitulate fundamental clinical and genetic features of human cancers,
including the development of spontaneous tumors in the setting of an intact immune system. To speed translation
of NK immunotherapy approaches, the proposed project will test an innovative treatment of allogeneic NK
adoptive transfer in combination with a novel caninized anti-PD-L1 antibody developed by our comparative
oncology group. Using a co-clinical Phase II trial format, dogs with locally advanced melanoma will be treated
with radiation therapy (RT), adoptive transfer of expanded/activated allogeneic NK cells from healthy beagle
donors, and immune checkpoint blockade using our dog anti-PD-L1 antibody. As the first trial to use NK cell
transfer in combination with ICI on spontaneous tumors in a clinical setting, the results of this study will provide
potentially transformative insights into mechanisms of both therapies and will evaluate barriers for future first-in-
human trials on solid tumors. Since NK cell activity is known to be mediated by the PD-1/PD-L1 axis with PD-L1
being a critical inhibitory NK marker, the proposed study will offer critical insight into potential mechanisms of
overcoming NK dysfunction responsible for unimpressive responses with NK cell immunotherapies alone.
Furthermore, RT is part of the standard of care for unresectable malignancies and has been shown to have
important immunomodulatory effects, including sensitization of tumor cells to NK cytotoxicity. The Canter Lab is
a leader in canine clinical trials as well as their use as tools to perform multidimensional analyses of NK cells.
Similarly, the potentially high impact of this novel immuno-oncology (IO) therapy will be studied through extensive
correlative studies including flow cytometry to follow the regional differences of donor and endogenous NK cells,
killing assays to assess changes in cytotoxicity, and RNA sequencing to characterize differential gene expression
of relevant immune populations. Although we hypothesize meaningful clinical and immunologic effects from this
novel therapy, we will nevertheless gain key insights into the dog as a comparative model for future dog and
human IO studies. Thus, beyond the potential for significant scientific and clinical impact, the completion of this
study will provide me with cutting edge training in comparative cancer immunotherapy to prepare me for a
successful career as a veterinary scientist in cancer immunology and NK immunotherapy."

The specific goals for the proposed T35 Pre-Doctoral Research Traineeship Program at Vanderbilt University
Medical Center are to recruit high-quality students as T35 research trainees, provide a productive and
meaningful traineeship, nurture the foundation that transforms a clinical to research mindset, and facilitate
progression towards a career as an independently NIH-funded clinician-scientist. This program supports the
goal of the NIH to build a strong clinician-scientist workforce to meet biomedical, behavioral, and clinical
research needs. The proposed T35 traineeship program is specifically for graduate students in training for a
clinical doctorate in audiology (AuD). Scientists with a clinical background, such as audiology, are well
positioned to identify key clinically driven questions that will ultimately impact patient care and outcomes.
Despite the importance of engaging clinicians in research careers, the low number of individuals with clinical
training in audiology who are obtaining research expertise and credentials via a PhD in hearing science
remains a concern. Short-term support for three months of full-time research training is requested for five pre-
doctoral AuD students for each of the five years of the grant. Trainees will select from among eleven
preceptors in ten laboratories with active research programs in the Department of Hearing and Speech
Sciences at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Each trainee will conduct hands-on research involving all
phases of a specific project in a laboratory under the guidance of their preceptor, complete formal training in
responsible conduct in research and research reproducibility, complete a T35 research course taught by the
T35 preceptors, participate in journal club discussions, and experience activities typical of a research career.
The Vanderbilt preceptors’ research areas span basic and translational research in animal and human models
and address a wide range of topics including cochlear and neural physiology, development, aging, hereditary
hearing loss, speech perception, multisensory cortical function, directional hearing and amplification, pediatric
audiology, cochlear implants and bimodal hearing, listening effort, and auditory fatigue. Trainees will learn
about the aspects of developing, designing, collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data, and reporting the
results of a research study. All trainees will present their research at a national scientific meeting and develop
a manuscript, in collaboration with their preceptor, publishable in a peer-reviewed journal. Strengths of the
proposed traineeship program include the standing of the Vanderbilt AuD program in the academic community,
the excellent research environment with state-of-the-art laboratories, numerous collaborations among the
preceptors, and strong institutional support. Independent researchers with clinical backgrounds are well suited
to identify and solve public health problems. The proposed program will provide research training with the goal
of developing a scientific mindset that leads the trainee to a research career. This will benefit society by
ensuring a strong future for evidence-based research related to hearing health and patient care."
10844461,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The non-lesional and lesional skin of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients is rich in type I interferons
(IFNs) which contribute to a propensity for inflammation, apoptosis, and photosensitivity. Importantly, while new
drugs are now approved for global blockade of type I IFN signaling in SLE, their effects may be moderate and
side effects, including risk of viral infections, remain a barrier to treatment. Further, while interferons are
important, there is a critical knowledge gap as to what regulates the propensity for interferon production and
inflammation in SLE skin. Addressing this gap will lead to mechanistic understanding of CLE lesions that can be
targeted to precisely eliminate the pathogenic players without side effects, such as those generated by global
IFN blockade, and potentially prevent disease. Our novel preliminary data has uncovered a role for functional
dysregulation of the Hippo signaling pathway in SLE keratinocytes through overexpression of the apical key
regulator, WW domain containing protein 1 (WWC1), resulting in chronic overactivation of Hippo signaling and
increased phosphorylation of Yes-associated protein (YAP). Our data also show that this skewing of YAP
phosphorylation may be critical for the aberrant apoptotic responses that have been identified in SLE
keratinocytes. While this data is impactful on its own, recent reports in the cancer literature also suggest that
members of the Hippo pathway may be critical regulators of type I IFN production through interactions with the
cGAS/STING pathway5,6. Indeed, our preliminary data identify SLE-overproduction of IFN-κ as STING-
dependent and blockade of YAP phosphorylation through LATS1/2 inhibition as sufficient to block IFNK
transcription after STING activation. These data form the basis of our overall hypothesis that dysregulation
of Hippo signaling is a critical driver of lupus keratinocyte dysfunction and that modulation of key Hippo-
signaling mediators will “normalize” lupus keratinocyte behavior. We will address this hypothesis through
the following aims: Aim 1: Uncover the role of the Hippo pathway in driving enhanced SLE keratinocyte
apoptosis. Aim 2: Determine the mechanisms by which Hippo signaling skews the production of type I
interferons in SLE keratinocytes. Aim 3: Determine the role of Hippo signaling in UVB-mediated NF-κB-
driven inflammatory responses. Successful completion of this proposal will uncover important new biology
regarding the interaction of type I IFNs and Hippo signaling and identify specific Hippo pathway targets that will
serve as novel targets for prevention and treatment of SLE skin disease."

The use of technology to monitor health, deliver health care and manage chronic and critical illness is
becoming more and more pervasive. Technology is increasingly touted as transforming health care. The
speed at which the technology field is advancing, combined with the burgeoning number of elders and
persons living in the community with complex illnesses and disabilities, and undeniable health inequities,
make it imperative that nurse scientists be prepared to examine the vital role of technology and clinical
data science in promoting better patient health outcomes within an interdisciplinary context. The
overarching goal of this training program remains to provide rigorous research training and
interdisciplinary culturalization to build nursing science aimed at promoting health, managing illness,
reducing disability, and enhancing quality of life through the aid of technology and clinical data science.
For this renewal we now add a greater emphasis on leveraging technology, clinical data analytics and
design-justice to reduce health disparities and promote health equity for vulnerable populations due to
social inequalities. Based on the growing need for nurse researchers to lead interdisciplinary teams and
contribute their unique domain expertise to these rapidly growing fields the specific aims of the training
program are to provide: 1) the theoretical and conceptual foundations to support the development of a
program of research that examines ways that technological solutions can be used to address unmet
clinical needs by enabling the prevention, detection, prediction, or management of health-related
problems, 2) the methodological skills to combine nursing domain knowledge and emerging clinical data
science strategies to better understand complex health phenomena, 3) the knowledge and skill to
incorporate equity and justice in designing technology and clinical data science studies in order to mitigate
social inequalities and health disparities, while promoting health equity across groups and vulnerable
populations and 4) skills to lead interdisciplinary teams to conduct research of impact that propels
technology solutions and clinical data science along pathways of translation into practice or
commercialization. Funding is requested to continue the program for five years to support three
predoctoral and two postdoctoral trainees per year. Clearly, nurse researchers need to be able to examine
the effectiveness, as well as the appropriateness, acceptability, and adherence of patients and providers
to high-tech health solutions and collaborate with the multiple disciplines that contribute to such efforts.
Unquestionably, this program will enable nurse trainees to be well-positioned to conduct innovative, state-
of-the-art research in this growing field."

Understanding how behavioral states are encoded by the adolescent brain may be critical for detection and
prevention of brain disorders and reckless behaviors including suicide attempts that emerge in this
developmental stage. There is, however, a glaring paucity of data about the neuronal circuity of motivated
behavior in adolescent models. This may be primarily due to the technical challenge of executing methods that
are routine in adult animals, in adolescent models. We propose to exploit tools and supporting data generated
during the last funding period to address the overarching hypothesis that circuit dynamics that support
associative learning and ensuing decisions are different in adolescent and adult brains. We have observed that
reward (outcome) processing by lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), substantia nigra (SN), and medial dorsal
striatum (DS) neurons differ between adolescent and adult rats. In contrast, more traditional “limbic” regions
such as the nucleus accumbens (NAc) have nearly identical pattern of reward encoding in adults and
adolescents. These are critical observations because appropriate response selection and inhibition toward a
desired outcome are dependent on the integrity of OFC-DS circuits. Here we aim to test the specific hypothesis
that in adolescents, action-outcome associative learning, and response inhibition and initiation after learning,
are computed differently in DS-OFC circuits, but not NAc-OFC circuits. To test this hypothesis, we have
developed an action-guided behavior task to assess associative learning and response inhibition which can be
(1) implemented during the short rodent adolescent period and (2) combined with multiregional
electrophysiology recording and local opto- or chemo-genetic circuit manipulation. We propose three aims. The
first two aims assess similarities, or differences, in neuronal processing of the same behavioral events in each
circuit in adolescents and adults. A third aim will focus on selective pathway manipulation to characterize
potential mechanisms that contribute to the different circuit dynamics observed in adolescents. Regardless of
the outcome, completion of this work will provide valuable mechanistic data about the neuronal basis of
learning and response inhibition in the adolescent brain."

Pneumonias cause millions of deaths annually and cause chronic health complications in many survivors. Yet,
despite constant exposure of an immense surface area to the external environment, the lungs’ intrinsic
defenses clear most pathogens before infections are established. These mucosal defenses can be
therapeutically stimulated using a novel inhaled therapy comprised of a non-intuitive, synergistic synthetic
pattern recognition receptor agonist combination. This inducible resistance results in rapid intrapulmonary
pathogen killing and prevents death in mice from otherwise lethal pneumonias caused by bacterial, viral or
fungal pathogens. Lung epithelial cells are principal mediators of this response, and reliance on airway and
alveolar cells is fortuitous for patients with leukocyte-dependent immunocompromising conditions. The current
proposal supports a program investigating the mechanisms by which this phenomenon protects against acute
pneumonia and chronic lung disease, allowing greater understanding of native mucosal defenses, identifying
populations most likely to benefit, and promoting development of more efficacious interventions against
pneumonia. This program is designed to produce the greatest scientific advance and most robust training
environment, so rather than targeting pre-specified milestones, investigations align within four self-sustaining
enterprises that serially pursue testable hypotheses then iteratively build upon the generated data.
Enterprise 1 dissects the mechanisms of synergistic signaling that drive pneumonia protection to reveal how
optimized coincident detection can maximize the protective signal through novel sensors and amplifiers.
Enterprise 2 pursues the mechanisms of inducible reactive oxygen species production to explain how sensing
and signaling events promote coordinated generation of multisource antimicrobial volatile species.
Enterprise 3 addresses the effector mechanisms that achieve broad pathogen killing to better define the extent
of protection and investigate unexplored interactions of antimicrobial peptides and reactive oxygen species.
Enterprise 4 explores the mechanisms that promote durably induced immunomodulatory effects to determine
how inducible resistance exerts effects against asthma and immunopathology over extended time scales.
These efforts will identify critical signaling events and effector mechanisms of inducible resistance, reveal
unanticipated sensor interactions, facilitate discovery of more efficacious inducers of resistance, and expedite
the translation of this technology into the clinic to protect patients during periods of peak vulnerability."

Pregnancies among women with developmental disabilities that affect cognition (DD-C) are often unplanned,
which may contribute to the poor pregnancy outcomes that have been observed in this population. Existing
research indicates that women with DD-C have limited reproductive knowledge, face substantial barriers to
comprehensive preconception care, are rarely engaged as active participants in reproductive decision-making,
and are frequently discouraged from considering pregnancy or motherhood. This combination of disadvantages
leaves women with DD-C ill-prepared to make informed decisions about pregnancy planning and places them
at risk of unintended pregnancies and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Currently, there are no resources tailored
to the needs of women with DD-C to help them make informed, evidence-based decisions about attempting or
preventing pregnancy. Data are lacking on the specific information women with DD-C need for making
pregnancy planning decisions and the optimal approaches for presenting relevant information in a way that
women with DD-C will understand, relate to, and trust. The long-term goal of this work is to promote informed,
engaged pregnancy decision-making among women with DD-C to improve maternal and child health
outcomes. In this project, the overall objective is to assess needs and determinants of pregnancy planning
decisions among women with DD-C and develop an accessible pregnancy decision support tool. Specifically,
we aim to: 1) Identify the information needs, factors influencing pregnancy decision-making, and priority setting
processes regarding pregnancy in women with DD-C; 2) Characterize current pregnancy knowledge and
comprehension of different methods of presenting information in a multi-state sample of women with DD-C;
and 3) Design a patient-friendly interactive decision aid to promote evidence-based pregnancy decision-
making by women with DD-C. The research proposed in this application is innovative because the project is
conducted in collaboration with women with DD-C and because it is the first to investigate relationships
between framing of information and the extent to which women with DD-C understand and trust that
information. The expected outcome from this project is a novel, intellectually appropriate tool to optimize
pregnancy timing and outcomes for women with DD-C. The tool will have established usability and
acceptability within our target population and will be ready for future efficacy testing in a clinical trial. The
proposed research is significant because it will determine which methods are most effective for communicating
medical information to women with DD-C – a positive impact of this project that extends beyond pregnancy
decision-making."

The objectives of this MIRA application are to 1) in vivo profiling of heterogeneous Adenosine deaminase acting
on RNA (ADAR) using RNA nano-reporters as a tool to understand ADAR biology and guide the design of ADAR-
based therapy; 2) promoting endogenous ADAR modulation using chimeric ADAR aptamer-gRNA (guide RNA)
and a type I interferon (IFN-I)-activating DNA oligonucleotide that induces ADAR1; 3) targeted delivery of
albumin-hitchhiking DNA/RNA for endogenous ADAR-based gene therapy and immunotherapy; and 4) pilot
testing of these theranostics in mouse models of Factor V Leiden (FVL) thrombophilia and metastatic melanoma.
ADAR mediates RNA Adenosine-to-Inosine editing in metazoans. ADAR is an intriguing endogenous RNA editor
for the gene therapy of diseases caused by pathogenic G->A mutations, such as FVL thrombophilia; moreover,
ADAR1 inhibition in tumor cells sensitizes their immunotherapy. However, ADAR levels are highly
heterogeneous and dynamic across individuals, tissues, and cell environments, making it pivotal for
spatiotemporal ADAR profiling to study ADAR biology and design personalized ADAR-based therapy. To this
end, we will develop and test an ADAR reporter for non-invasive real-time ADAR profiling in vivo, using an ADAR-
activatable split luciferase mRNA reporter followed by bioluminescence imaging. Further, the often low
endogenous ADAR levels limit ADAR editing efficacy, which impedes ADAR biological discovery and theranostic
applications. To address this challenge and promote the RNA editing efficacy of endogenous ADAR, we will
study two strategies: 1) using ADAR aptamer-gRNA chimera to promote ADAR binding and editing of RNA; and
2) using our novel IFN-I-activating DNA agonist for cyclic GMP-AMP synthase to elevate ADAR levels and
promote ADAR modulatory efficacy. All these nucleic acid theranostics, such as aptamers, siRNA, and mRNA,
hold great potential to reshape human medicine. Yet, naked DNA/RNA has limited clinical success thus far,
largely due to poor pharmacokinetics (PK) and inability to enter cells, calling for mechanistic understanding and
manipulation of the interactions between biological systems and DNA/RNA. Previously, we developed a
molecular albumin hitchhiker and nanoparticles that promoted the PK and delivery of nucleic acids by up to 200
folds. Here, we will use lipid nanoparticles to deliver mRNA reporters for in vivo ADAR profiling; we will study
targeted delivery of albumin-hitchhiking ADAR nucleic acid therapeutics, including aptamer-gRNA chimera for
FVL thrombophilia gene therapy and siRNAADAR1 for advanced melanoma immunotherapy. We will engineer
nucleic acid scaffolds to co-deliver synergistic nucleic acids at defined stoichiometry. We will delineate the
engineering principles to improve the PK, (co-)delivery, safety, and therapeutic efficacy, and promote intracellular
trafficking and target interaction; we will study the impact of targeting ligands (aptamers, peptides, N-
acetylgalactosamine) on these outcomes. Overall, these studies would establish the guidelines to design nucleic
acid tools to understand and modulate ADAR biology, and design personalized ADAR therapy.

interventions through task-shifting models has great potential to narrow the mental health services gap. Lay
counselor delivery of evidence-based treatments can be implemented with fidelity and result in reduced post-

(1) content expertise in dissemination and implementation of mental health evidence-based treatments,
(2)
mixed methods tools for conducting sustainment research
to identify strategies enabling the continuation of
scaled-up interventions, (3) approaches to generalize trial results and extend the policy reach of evidence-based

10794271,"Project Summary/Abstract. “Why did I choose to do that?” Being able to answer this common question – and
accurately reflect on the mental processes underlying one’s choices – is fundamental to good decision-making
and healthy relationships. This capacity is impaired in some forms of psychopathology; inaccurate
self-reflection appears related to psychiatric symptoms in diverse areas such as schizophrenia spectrum
disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and substance use disorders1–12, and improving self-reflection is a
goal of many therapeutic interventions13–16. Yet, the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying self-reflective
(in)accuracy are poorly understood because the field lacks objective, quantitative measures of this ability.
I propose to use a novel measure (which I’ve developed and piloted) to quantify people’s self-reflective
accuracy about their choice processes, and relate this accuracy to psychiatric symptom variation in the
general population. In this task, participants first make choices between options (e.g., homes to rent, or social
events to attend) which vary on many attributes17,18. Then, participants report how they believe they made their
choices, including how much weight they placed on each attribute and how they combined the attributes
together. I then fit a set of established models to participants’ choices17,19, recovering key aspects of their
choice process. By comparing participants’ self-reports to the process revealed in their actual choices, I
can obtain an objective measure of participants’ self-reflective accuracy about their choice process.
Using this measure, I will test whether schizotypy and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (in a
general-population sample) correlate with lower self-reflective accuracy (Study 1), and whether
symptoms of disordered alcohol use correlate with lower accuracy in the specific context of choices
involving alcohol (Study 2). Finally, I will add my measure to an ongoing NIH-funded clinical trial testing
whether a mindfulness intervention can reduce alcohol consumption among heavy drinkers. I will test whether
this mindfulness intervention improves self-reflective accuracy in alcohol-related choice20,21, and
whether improvements in accuracy mediate reductions in alcohol consumption22–24 (Study 3). This research
provides a generative paradigm for quantifying self-reflective accuracy in choice, supporting future investigation
into the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying self-reflection and its disruption in psychopathology1,3,7,9,10,25
and offering a benchmark for validating future therapeutic interventions26.
My background is in computational models of choice27–30, and in this fellowship I will learn to apply these models
to psychopathology. My mentor team includes experts in computational cognitive science, psychopathology,
computational psychiatry, clinical interventions, and self-understanding, and the training plan involves substantial
coursework, one-on-one mentorship, and seminar attendance. Moreover, Princeton – with its world-renowned
faculty in computational psychiatry – offers an unparalleled environment to conduct this research and training."
10784755,"Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), an essential procedure in the treatment of patients with
hematological malignancies, also temporarily increases the risk for infections with invasive fungi. The recovery
in the neutrophil number after HSCT is commonly regarded as a key metric for the restoration of antifungal
defenses. However, the metric is imprecise, and there is an urgent need for new biomarkers to help identify the
patients at risk. In the absence of new tools, the management of invasive fungal infections remains remarkably
challenging. The long-term goal of this research is to engineer new tools and validate new metrics estimating
the risk for invasive fungal infections in HSCT patients. Achieving this goal requires a focus on neutrophil
swarming function, which is critical in effective antifungal immune responses. Swarming is distinct from
phagocytosis in that it involves neutrophil-neutrophil communication that helps coordinate the activities of
multiple cells toward blocking the growth of invasive fungi. The focus on neutrophil swarming is justified by
preliminary results showing that in HSCT patients, even when the neutrophil count recovered at 4 weeks after
transplant, a neutrophil swarming deficiency is still present and is substantial. Knowledge about how neutrophil
swarming deficiency is resolved over time after HSCT is currently lacking. To address this knowledge gap and
evaluate the utility of new biomarkers we will pursue the following specific aims: 1) Determine neutrophil
swarming parameters that are distinct in healthy and HSCT patients. 2) Determine what cytokines help restore
the swarming activity of neutrophils from HSCT patients and 3) Design new imaging techniques for label-free
tracking of human neutrophils responding to microscopic tissue injuries in vivo. If successful, the proposed
research could have a major impact on the lives of HSCT patients by improving the monitoring of their recovery
and by identifying potential strategies for accelerating the recovery of their neutrophil functions and improving
their protection against fungal infections."

Opioid use disorder is a public health crisis in the United States with roughly 80,000 overdoses taking place in
2021. Addiction can be conceptualized in three phases: binge/intoxication, withdrawal/negative affect, and
preoccupation/craving. Current treatments for opioid use disorder substitute reward and prevent withdrawal,
but there exists a treatment gap for the habitual/compulsive use associated with the third phase of addiction,
necessitating better understanding of the molecular and cellular underpinnings of this behavior. Using an
unbiased screening of the epigenome of postmortem samples of dorsal striatum from human heroin users, the
Hurd Lab identified a promoter region for the gene encoding Fyn kinase as the locus with the most variance
explained by heroin use in neurons. Fyn mRNA expression was elevated both in these human samples and in
the dorsal striatum of rats that underwent heroin self-administration. Inhibition of Fyn either with a small
molecule drug or siRNA infusions into the dorsal striatum decreased response for heroin in a translational
model of relapse. Different subregions of the dorsal striatum mediate different aspects of drug-seeking
behavior. I found that rats that compulsively sought heroin showed increased Fyn expression in both
dorsomedial and dorsolateral striatum, while rats that took heroin non-compulsively showed increased Fyn
expression in the dorsomedial subregion. My project will investigate the molecular and cellular mechanisms of
Fyn in heroin self-administration behavior. I will knock down Fyn in dorsomedial and dorsolateral striatal
subregions and test motivated and compulsive heroin seeking behavior, with the hypothesis that Fyn
knockdown in dorsomedial striatum will reduce goal-directed responding, while Fyn knockdown in dorsolateral
striatum will reduce habitual responding. I will perform RNA-sequencing in these subregions to assess
molecular networks modulated by Fyn. To determine how Fyn regulates neural activity during heroin seeking, I
will record neuronal activity in the dorsal striatum using in-vivo fiber-photometry. These experiments will enable
me to uncover the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying Fyn’s role in heroin use disorder and its
effects on behavioral models of motivated versus habitual drug taking. I will learn a behavioral model of
compulsivity, calcium imaging, and RNA-sequencing which will equip me to answer questions relating
molecular changes to neuronal activity to behavior in my future career as a physician-scientist."

The complexity of the human brain and lack of adequate models severely hinders our ability to understand
mechanisms guiding neurodevelopment and neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), necessitating an innovative
bioengineered approach for improving in vitro organotypic models of the human brain. Recent advances in stem
cell-based neural organoids enable the formation of assembloids, which are fusions of organoids representing
different brain regions. However, current approaches remain limited in the ability to properly recapitulate native
brain cytoarchitecture and maturation within these organoids and also result in large heterogeneity due to the
lack of a well-defined matrix. The proposed research seeks to resolve these critical issues by creating a reliable
and reproducible in vitro environment for neural organoid culture to study aspects of neurodevelopment and
NDDs that have been difficult to achieve with current platforms. To do this, I will 1) assess the effect of matrix
biochemical cues for improving neural organoid architecture and maturation; 2) define the role of matrix stress
relaxation and confinement on organoid growth; and 3) leverage the engineered hydrogel platform to study
impaired interneuron migration in a disease model of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS). I hypothesize that
the experiments described in my proposal will show that matrix-derived biochemical and biophysical signaling
will allow for more robust neural organoid culture that better recapitulates the architecture and maturation of the
human brain compared to conventional neural organoid models. I also hypothesize that fusion of 22q11DS neural
organoids within engineered hydrogels will robustly demonstrate dysregulated interneuron migration mediated
by the deletion of DCGR8. Of note, interneuron migration is a phenomenon that does not occur in murine systems
and therefore cannot be studied using conventional murine models. To test this hypothesis, I will utilize a minimal
matrix (HELP) to culture brain region-specific neural organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem cells
(iPSCs) from healthy and 22q11DS patients. I will perform robust characterization of neural organoid architecture,
maturation, and growth rate in response to tuning matrix biochemical and biophysical properties. I will also
assess the ability of interneurons from 22q11DS patients to migrate into the dorsal forebrain by establishing a
dorsal–ventral forebrain assembloid disease model. Together, these results will be critical for engineering a
platform that is both permissive and instructive for robust and efficient neural organoid culture. In addition to
expanding my scientific technical skills, my training plan includes development of mentorship, scientific writing,
and presentation skills; training in research ethics; and enhancement of collaboration skills through a series of
on-campus courses, workshops, and seminars as well as off-campus conferences. Altogether, this research
proposal will empower me to become an independent, productive research scientist as I leverage the self-
organizing capacity of stem cells and the tunable capacity of engineered materials to develop more human-
relevant neural disease models."

When examined by electron microscopy, neurons can be seen to carry organelles that look like little black dots.
These black dots are called dense-core vesicles and they carry many important transmitters that act as
neuromodulators, including neuropeptides, nerve growth factors, and monoamines such as dopamine and
norepinephrine. Such dense-core vesicle cargos regulate a wide array of behaviors, and defects in such
cargos can contribute to numerous mood disorders and other neurological conditions. However, little is
understood about the cell biology of how dense-core vesicles are made, acquire cargos and mature, are
trafficked to release sites, and ultimately released. Thus, the little black dots in neurons are really a big black
box. Adding to the mysteries and complexity of these organelles, many neurons carry multiple dense-core
vesicle cargos in the same cell. Are these different cargos copackaged together in the same dense-core
vesicles or are they packaged separately in distinct vesicles? The answer to this question is surprisingly known
in only a few cases, and the general pattern of copackaging versus segregation of distinct cargos is unclear,
but is of key physiological relevance as it determines whether different dense-core vesicle cargos are
coreleased or can be released independently. Additionally, in cases where distinct dense-core vesicle
subpopulations are known to exist in the same cell, it is unclear how these distinct populations are generated
and how cargos are differentially sorted. To begin to address these gaps in understanding, here we aim to
establish two model systems for the study of distinct dense-core vesicle populations in the same cell: the ASI
sensory neuron in the nematode C. elegans and the rat pancreatic beta-cell line 832/13. Our preliminary data
show that members of a known dense-core vesicle biogenesis and maturation pathway, the Rab2/EARP
pathway, are required for one subpopulation of dense-core vesicles in both the ASI neuron and the 832/13 cell
line, but not for another subpopulation in the same cell. In Aim 1, we will further define the requirements for
members of the Rab2/EARP pathway in the biogenesis and maturation of distinct dense-core vesicle
subpopulations in the ASI neuron and 832/13 cells. Additionally, we will perform candidate screens in an
attempt to identify factors required for the Rab2/EARP-independent generation of dense-core vesicles in both
cell types. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that different subpopulations of dense-core vesicles are marked
by different isoforms of the synaptotagmin family of calcium sensors. We will also determine whether these
synaptotagmins control the release of distinct dense-core vesicle subpopulations. In summary, this project will
identify the basic molecules required for the generation and release of distinct subpopulations of dense-core
vesicles in the same cell, and set the stage for more mechanistic investigations into how these processes
occur."

 A majority of cancer-related deaths are the result of the metastatic spread of cancer cells from their
primary tumor location to distant sites in the body. Cell mechanical properties, including stiffness, are related to
the migratory and metastatic potential of tumor cells. However, previous studies are limited by observing cell
mechanics as an effect rather than as a potential driving force of metastasis. If a causal link between cell stiffness
and metastatic potential in vivo can be established, direct modulation of cell mechanics could constitute a
therapeutic strategy to slow or stop the metastatic spread of cancer cells.
 The long term goal of this research is to connect cell behaviors and mechanical properties studied in vitro
with in vivo metastatic phenotypes to identify therapeutic control points of cell mechanotype and metastasis. A
microfluidic stiffness-based cell sorting device will be used to generate stiff and soft cell subpopulations to
compare the effect of cell stiffness on the various stages of metastasis that occur in an orthotopic breast cancer
mouse model. Preliminary experiments have established our ability to successfully sort cells based on several
biophysical properties. Additionally, the Reinhart-King lab is uniquely positioned to compare in vitro and in vivo
cell behaviors to understand metastasis. This project will explore the question of the causal link between cell
stiffness and cell metastatic potential by 1) determining the heritability of cancer cell mechanotypes through
microfluidic stiffness-based cell sorting, 2) investigating the role of cell stiffness on multiple stages of in vivo
metastasis, and 3) exploring the genetic and epigenetic control points of cell stiffness for abatement of metastatic
spread. First, the established microfluidic device will be used to repeatedly sort four breast cancer cell lines into
mechanical subpopulations, tracking whether cells remain stiff or soft after cell division and passaging. The
sorted populations will then be injected into the mammary fat pad of a mouse to form an orthotopic breast cancer
model monitoring the effect of cell stiffness on metastatic tumor formation as well as studying the effect of
stiffness of in vivo and in vitro models of each step of the metastatic cascade. Finally, multi-omics analyses will
be used to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms that result in each mechanical subpopulation.
 The result of the proposed study will show, for the first time, the causal relationship between cell
mechanical properties and their ability to successfully traverse each step in the metastatic cascade in vivo. The
applicant’s long-term career goal is to become a leading researcher and expert in the field of metastatic cancer

 During development, animal behaviors improve as neural circuits refine. Prior work suggests that early
developmental events, such as birth timing, define the role a neuron will play in a circuit. However, the
complexity of most developing circuits and the behaviors they subserve limit our understanding of the role of
early events in circuit maturation. My proposed experiments address this gap by asking if early development
shapes circuit maturation. Defining the relationship between development and function is key to understand
the how the brain and behavior mature in healthy and diseased states.
 The larval zebrafish is a particularly tractable model for circuit development due to its genetic accessibility,
transparency, and rapid external development. Specifically, the neuronal populations driving gaze stabilization
following body tilts in the larval zebrafish are well-conserved and orders of magnitude smaller. Our lab
leverages these advantages to link developmental phenomenology with circuit maturation and behavior. We
have established genetic and optical means to longitudinally measure and manipulate neural activity across
development. Importantly, prior work from our lab has revealed that the birthdate of vestibular neurons
influences anatomical location within the brainstem and preferred direction of body tilt.
 The goal of this proposal is to determine if birthdate similarly predicts how sensory responses
mature, and if birthdate predicts a neuron’s contribution to behavior. In Aim 1, I will determine if a central
vestibular neuron’s birthdate predicts its sensitivity to body tilts of different magnitudes, and/or how this
encoding matures. In Aim 2, I will examine how developmentally and functionally diverse populations of
vestibular neurons contribute to behavior using loss- and gain-of-function approaches. My data will define the
role of early development in circuit function. Completion of these experiments will speak to the general
mechanisms by which circuit function is influenced by – or indifferent to – early development."

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) affects 1-4% of children, can lead to cognitive, behavioral, and cardiovascular
morbidity, and is associated with a 226% increase in healthcare utilization. Guidelines recommend
adenotonsillectomy (AT) as first-line treatment for pediatric OSA and nearly half a million are performed in U.S.
children annually. However, AT is a one-size-fits-all procedure for a condition with pathophysiology that can
differ dramatically between individuals based on differences in upper airway anatomy and dynamics. These
differences likely account for the high rate of persistent post-AT OSA. Drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE)
is a flexible fiber-optic assessment of the upper airway performed under sedation that has potential to direct
individualized surgical treatment and improve outcomes in children with OSA. While early series have
demonstrated good outcomes after DISE-assisted surgery, there is currently no well-controlled, prospective
data to support the use of DISE in children. Prospective research on pediatric DISE has been fundamentally
hindered by the lack of a standardized sedation protocol for the procedure. Choice of sedative may be
important as anesthetic drugs impact upper airway patency to various degrees. Fundamental questions about
how DISE findings should be interpreted and applied cannot be answered without first understanding which
anesthetic facilitates the most useful assessment of upper airway obstruction. The goal of this project is to
determine which anesthetic should be used for DISE. We will perform a randomized controlled trial comparing
the two anesthetic drugs most commonly used to sedate children for the procedure: dexmedetomidine (DEX)
and propofol. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that PROP exaggerates dynamic obstruction
compared to DEX, and thus DISE under DEX provides a more useful and predictive measurement of upper
airway obstruction during sleep. To test this, we will 1) compare mean DISE obstruction scores under sedation
with PROP versus DEX and 2) test the predictive value of obstruction seen on DISE but left untreated by AT
on post-AT outcomes (improvement in symptoms, behavior, quality-of-life, and polysomnography measures)
and need for further treatment for persistent post-AT OSA. To accomplish these aims, Dr. Kirkham will receive
mentorship, focused didactic coursework and training in pediatric sleep medicine and on the design and
implementation of randomized controlled trials. Dr. Kirkham’s long-term goal is to become a leading
independent clinical investigator and expert in the surgical treatment of pediatric OSA. An NHLBI K23 award
will provide Dr. Kirkham with the protected time and needed training to achieve her career goals and improve
outcomes for children with sleep apnea."

Pancreatic β-cell failure in a distinctive feature of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and therefore preservation of
β-cell health has been identified as a critical barrier for the development of successful preventative and treatment
strategies in T2DM. Primary features of β-cell failure include insulin secretory dysfunction, loss of transcriptional
identity/β-cell dedifferentiation, and β-cell loss, with growing evidence pointing to impaired endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) proteostasis as a key driver of this process. Recent evidence suggests that environmental stress conditions
that produce disruptions of daily fasting/feeding circadian cycles (i.e. circadian disruption, CD) lead to glucose
intolerance, hyperglycemia, and promote β-cell failure in T2DM. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying
circadian control of β-cell function and ER proteostasis remain unknown. In this regard, our preliminary studies
determined that CD-mediated abrogation of normal fasting/feeding cycles is a potent physiological inducer of β-
cell functional failure, and this process is molecularly mediated through loss of β-cell expression/activity of
circadian transcription factor D-box binding PAR bZIP transcription factor (Dbp). Therefore, the key objective of
the proposal is to test the hypothesis that Dbp is an important regulator of β-cell circadian function through
rhythmic activation of transcripts regulating insulin secretion and ER proteostasis, whereas loss of Dbp
expression, as occurs in β-cells in response to circadian disruption and diet-induced obesity, promotes β-cell
functional decline in T2DM. To address this, Specific Aim 1 will utilize novel conditional genetic loss and gain-of-
function Dbp mouse models to establish a causative relationship between circadian Dbp expression and the
regulation of β-cell function, ER proteostasis, and transcriptional identity. In addition, we will also examine
whether Dbp regulates β-cell function and transcription in human β-cells utilizing viral gain/loss of function
techniques concurrent with transplantation of human stem cell-derived β-cells into immunodeficient mice.
Specific Aim 2 will utilize β-cell-specific Dbp luciferase reporter mice and systems biology multiomics approaches
(RNAseq + scATAC seq) to 1) identify molecular mechanisms by which obesity disrupts circadian regulation of
Dbp expression and corresponding β-cell circadian clock function, and 2) test novel strategies designed to
restore normal functionality of β-cell circadian clocks in obesity as means to prevent β-cell failure in T2DM. Taken
together, successful completion of proposed studies will uncover novel molecular mechanisms through which β-
cells integrate and respond to circadian changes in nutritional availability and will provide potential therapeutic
targets for prevention and treatment of T2DM."

As the global leading cause of death, heart failure is a major challenge for researchers in their quest to discover
therapeutics that can save countless lives. After cardiac injury, the heart begins to remodel itself in a way that is
initially adaptive, but this innate coping mechanism may over time expedite heart failure onset. Elucidating the
mechanisms which underly the progression from adaptive cardiac hypertrophic remodeling to heart failure will
dramatically impact the discovery of novel therapeutics for this deadly disease. While regulation of gene
expression through transcription of messenger RNA (mRNA) has been extensively studied, only recently an
appreciation for the importance of chemical modifications that can occur on mRNA has emerged. This proposal
focuses on the methylation of the N6-Adenosine of mRNA (m6A), which is the most abundant internal mRNA
modification in eukaryotes. Previous research from our lab has shown that modulation of m6A content in the
heart is sufficient to drive cardiac remodeling and to affect the ability of the heart to respond to stress. Despite
this, the exact mechanisms through which this occurs is not well understood. The fate of m6A-modified mRNAs
is regulated by members of the YTH Domain Family (YTHDF). We found that YTHDF3 is specifically important
in cardiomyocytes, where it localizes to the nucleus and binds to Myocyte Enhancer Factor 2D (MEF2D), which
is an important transcription factor regulating hypertrophic cardiac growth. Further, we have found that knockout
of YTHDF3 mitigates pathological remodeling following pressure overload injury. Given these preliminary data,
we hypothesize that YTHDF3 regulates cardiomyocyte size and stress-induced remodeling by modulating
the processing of m6A-modified mRNAs transcribed by MEF2D. To test this hypothesis, we already
generated and validated a new mouse line in which YTHDF3 can be selectively deleted in cardiomyocytes
(YTHDF3-cKO). In Aim 1, we will investigate the role of YTHDF3 at baseline and in the stressed murine heart
using longitudinal echocardiography analysis, and assessing histological and molecular signs of pathology at
the terminal time point. In Aim 2, we will determine the mechanism through which YTHDF3 regulates the fate of
specific subsets of MEF2D-transcribed m6A-mRNAs in cardiomyocytes. First, we will further characterize the
binding between YTHDF3 and MEF2D by defining the respective domains involved. Then, we will dissect the
binding of YTHDF3 to MEF2D mRNA targets and determine consequent stability, export, and translation of these
transcripts. Finally, in Aim 3, we will undertake an unbiased approach to more globally investigate the role of
YTHDF3 in regulating mRNA biology in healthy and stressed adult cardiomyocytes by cross-linking
immunoprecipitations of YTHDF3-bound mRNAs followed by sequencing (CLIP-seq). Our approach is innovative
and significant, as it will be the first project to define the role of YTHDF3 in the heart, which may lead to a new
field of therapeutics based on the biology of mRNA methylation."

Prenatal alcohol use (PAU) is associated with increased likelihood of obstetric complications, including preterm
labor, miscarriage, and stillbirth, and is also the direct cause of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders, a collection
of neurodevelopmental disorders that cause lifelong neurobehavioral and craniofacial abnormalities. In 2020,
the Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that approximately 1 in 7 pregnant women had
consumed alcohol in the past month, which is in line with increasing trends since 2011. Thus, PAU is a major
and growing public health problem, so it is imperative to understand the risk factors for PAU to inform
prevention and intervention. Stress is one such key risk factor. Pregnant women with frequent stress have a 3-
fold higher risk of binge drinking than pregnant women without frequent stress. Furthermore, pre-pregnancy
alcohol use is consistently associated with PAU, suggesting that understanding the etiology of alcohol misuse
outside of pregnancy is essential for preventing PAU. Correspondingly, stress plays a crucial role in Alcohol
Use Disorder (AUD) in women outside of pregnancy, as women are more vulnerable to relapse following
stressful triggers relative to men. This vulnerability may in part be driven by sex/gender (SG) differences in
neurocircuitry related to processing stress in AUD. Increased stress vulnerability has been linked to
dysfunction in the “salience network” (SN), which is a collection of brain regions, primarily the insula, the dorsal
anterior cingulate cortex, and inferior parietal lobule, that responds to salient, potentially stressful stimuli and is
also highly reactive to substance use cues, including alcohol. Furthermore, social support may serve as a
resilience factor against stress-related alcohol misuse, particularly in women. If and how social support can
also buffer the brain’s heightened vulnerability to stress in AUD, and if there are SG differences in this effect,
remains to be examined. Moreover, whether stress and social support similarly affect PAU is unclear. My
overarching hypothesis is that women, relative to men, are more vulnerable to stress-related alcohol misuse
via enhanced SN reactivity; however, social support will have a stronger buffering effect on this relationship in
women. The specific aims of this project are to (1A) assess SG differences in the role of the SN on the
relationship between stress reactivity and alcohol use levels in people with AUD, (1B) assess SG differences in
whether social support protects against alcohol misuse by altering stress-related SN reactivity, and (2)
determine risk and protective factors for prenatal alcohol use. Achieving these goals will inform scientifically-
grounded treatments for AUD in women during and outside of pregnancy, as well as prepare me for a
successful career as a physician-scientist in academic medicine."
10845489,"This F31 project seeks to advance the evidence on the violence prevention potential of early childhood
education programs and examine the interactive effects of such programs with multi-level social, economic,
and environmental factors on violence across the life course. In 2020, there were 4.6 million nonfatal violent
victimizations and almost 25,000 homicides in the United States (US).1,2 That year 15.2 million people aged 12
and older reported serious thoughts of suicide, and over 45,000 people died by suicide.1,3 While firearm access
is a significant determinant of violent death,4 risk is also profoundly determined by social and structural
conditions across the life course and inter-generationally, including poverty, early life adversity, and economic
opportunity.5 Despite evidence that sources of risk and resilience begin early in life and accumulate over the
life course and across generations, and that early childhood education can address shared developmental
etiologies of multiple forms of violence, there are critical gaps in our understanding of the long-term effects of
large-scale early childhood education programs on violence.6 This F31 project examines the long-term effects
of Head Start—one of the oldest and largest preschool programs for vulnerable children in the US—on inter-
personal violence perpetration and suicidal ideation, and the social and structural factors that modify those
effects. In Aim 1, we will examine inter-generational effects of Head Start on the second generation’s suicidal
ideation and inter-personal violence perpetration in adolescence and adulthood using a quasi-random variation
in Head Start roll-out over time and place and inter-generationally linked nationally-representative data from
the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 and Child & Young Adult cohorts. In Aim 2, we will examine
whether Aim 1 effects are modified by offspring sex and race/ethnicity, community disadvantage, and state
policies related to economic opportunity and structural racism. In Aim 3, we will examine the intra-generational
effects of Head Start on handgun carrying and inter-personal violence perpetration in adolescence and
adulthood using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997. In Aim 4 will examine whether Aim
3 effects are modified by participant sex and race/ethnicity, community disadvantage, and state policies related
to economic opportunity and structural racism. All Aims will use targeted maximum likelihood estimation, a
doubly-robust estimator for causal inference with observational data. This project provides the opportunity to
evaluate the effects of a widely implemented program to reduce the toll of violence in the nation. It will
contribute to scholarship on both early childhood education and violence prevention at a time when policy
conversations about violence and its social determinants are increasing in prominence and urgency. This
project will provide the F31 candidate rigorous training in 1) causal inference methods for observational data,
2) quasi-experimental methods for policy evaluation, 3) content expertise in life-course theories of violence and
early childhood education, and 4) social epidemiologic theories for macrosocial conditions and policies."
10814364,"Project Summary/Abstract
Appropriate differentiation and maintenance of cellular identity are required for normal development of all organs.
In the heart, mutations in genes that are necessary to maintain cardiomyocyte identity are associated with
structural congenital heart defects, which are the most common malformations found in newborns. Despite their
frequency, the etiology of most congenital heart defects remains poorly understood. Furthermore, numerous
structural congenital heart defects are associated with arrythmias. Although advances in surgical techniques
have been successful in allowing patients to survive to adulthood, the surgeries do not repair arrythmias
associated with the structural defects. Thus, it is essential to understand fundamental mechanisms directing
normal vertebrate heart development, in order to inform us of the etiology of congenital heart defects and their
associated arrythmias. A long-term goal of our lab is to understand the conserved molecular and genetic
mechanisms that direct cardiac chamber size during early vertebrate development. Nr2f transcriptions factors
have highly conserved requirements in vertebrate heart development. Furthermore, mutations in Nr2f genes in
humans are associated with a spectrum of congenital heart defects, including atrial septal defects. This proposal
will investigate fundamental mechanisms determining atrial chamber size through investigating Nr2f-dependent
mechanisms controlling atrial cardiomyocyte differentiation and the maintenance of atrial cardiomyocyte identity.
While requirements for Nr2f factors are well-established in atrial development, the mechanisms controlling Nr2f
gene expression in atrial cardiomyocytes and by which Nr2f transcription factors direct atrial cardiomyocyte
development remain poorly understood. Our work has shown that zebrafish Nr2f1a is the functional equivalent
of Nr2f2 in atrial development. Our preliminary data has identified a conserved enhancer that that is sufficient to
promote Nr2f1a expression in atrial cardiomyocytes zebrafish and that Nr2f1a has a previously unrecognized
requirement concurrently maintaining atrial cardiomyocyte and inhibiting the acquisition of pacemaker
cardiomyocyte identity. In Aim 1, we will interrogate the signals that regulate the conserved nr2f1a cis-regulatory
enhancer that promotes atrial cardiomyocyte expression. In Aim 2, we will determine the temporal requirements
of nr2f1a and the differentiation state of cardiomyocytes within the atria of nr2f1a mutants. In Aim 3, we will
elucidate the Nr2f-dependent gene regulatory networks that repress pacemaker cardiomyocyte identity in venous
atria. Our studies may provide a foundation of information that may inform us of the etiology of congenital heart
defects and their associated arrythmias, which ultimately may lead to novel therapies that can prevent or
ameliorate congenital heart defects and associated arrythmias in humans."

10914153,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Engagement in advance care planning (ACP), which includes having end-of-life (EoL) conversations and
completing advance directives (ADs) (e.g., living will, health care proxy), has been shown to improve the
quality of care and reduce suffering at the end of life. However, less than half of advanced cancer patients
engage in ACP or complete ADs. One commonly overlooked barrier to ACP engagement and AD completion is
a lack of acknowledgment that the majority of cancer patients report ACP as a social process in which they
want to engage multiple loved ones and family members in their decision-making process. Dr. Shen’s work, in
collaboration with her Co-Investigator Dr. Prigerson, suggests that patients frequently report involvement of
family members as a critical concern and need for engaging in ACP and that 70.7% report their EoL care
treatment preferences being shaped around concerns about their family members. Based on this pilot work
and prior work indicating a patient preference to engage in ACP as a social process, this study aims to develop
and pilot test a mobile application [Planning Advance Care Together (PACT)] designed to improve advanced
cancer patients’ and caregivers’ engagement in patients’ ACP, presence of ACP discussions, completion of
ADs, and receipt of goal-concordant care. The goals of this study are to: (1) refine and field-test a mobile
application intervention (PACT) using an iterative design approach, “Think Aloud” exercises, and usability
protocols; (2) evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, usability, satisfaction, and user engagement of the
intervention among advanced cancer patients and their caregivers; (3) test the preliminary efficacy of the
intervention on patients’ and caregivers’ level of engagement in ACP, documented ACP conversations, and
patients’ completion of ADs (primary outcomes); and patients’ and caregivers’ perceived social support and
family functioning as well as patients’ receipt of goal-concordant care (secondary outcomes); and (4) evaluate
process measures in a post-intervention interview. To meet these goals, we will collect feedback from
advanced cancer patients (n=10), caregivers (n=10), and providers (n=10) to improve and refine the
intervention prototype. Next, we will conduct iterative field-testing with two sets of patient-caregiver dyads
(n=15 per group) to refine the mobile application. Then, we will randomize n=100 patient-caregiver dyads to
the intervention group and n=100 dyads to the control group (usual care) and assess outcomes at baseline
and 3 and 6 months post-intervention to determine the feasibility, acceptability, usability, satisfaction, user
engagement, and preliminary efficacy of the intervention. Finally, we will conduct a brief post-intervention
interview with a subset of patients (n=15) and caregivers (n=15) to understand processes of using the PACT
application. Grounded in established theories of decision-making science, the proposed project takes the novel
approach of utilizing mobile health technology to integrate loved ones into patients’ ACP decision-making."
10928126,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
 Comprehensive regulation of transcription is a major mechanism by which immature cells functionally
determine their identity. The epigenetic factors responsible for this transcriptional regulatory activity are some
of the most potent, and most commonly mutated, factors implicated in tissue homeostasis and disease. We
understand the role of many epigenetic factors responsible for activating transcription, but we have a limited
understanding of the factors that repress transcription associated with differentiation. Additionally, we know
many of the epigenetic transcriptional regulators present on the chromatin before and after replication, but we
have a limited understanding of how these factors interact during replication. The relative lack of understanding
of how the replication machinery regulates transcription associated with cell identity is a key knowledge gap
in the field of epigenetics. Our studies suggest that the Chromatin Assembly Factor 1 (CAF1) complex,
functioning in its canonical role of replication-linked chromatin assembly, is the critical factor responsible for
directly regulating fate-specific transcription during replication.
 CAF1 is a heterotrimeric protein complex responsible for facilitating histone H3/H4 heterodimer
assembly at the replication fork during the S phase of cell cycle. Our lab focuses on the functional contributions
of CAF1 through studying its p60 subunit: Chromatin Assembly Factor 1B (CHAF1B). We are using CHAF1B
as a model for CAF1 function because of the abundance of tools and expertise we have generated to study
CHAF1B and the overwhelming evidence that readouts of CHAF1B and the CAF1 complex are functionally
identical. CHAF1B is highly expressed in uncommitted stem cells, and its expression decreases as cells
differentiate. We recently reported that CHAF1B directly binds chromatin at promoters and enhancers of
differentiation genes, repressing their expression by blocking transcription factor binding. Depletion of CHAF1B
in independent models led to massive upregulation of gene activation caused by transcription factors flooding
regions of chromatin previously occupied by CHAF1B. This led to our hypothesis: CHAF1B is a master
regulator of cell identity through a novel role as transcriptional repressor of fate genes in immature cells.
 Our long-term goal is to understand how cells regulate transcription associated with cell fate
throughout differentiation. Our short-term goal is to understand how the chromatin assembly machinery
affects transcriptional repression of fate genes in immature cells. In this proposal we will study the functional
roles of the factors responsible for CHAF1B direct binding to chromatin on transcription and phenotype (Focus
1), and the contributions of the DNA/protein complexes recruited by CHAF1B to the chromatin on transcription
and phenotype (Focus 2). Discoveries about CHAF1B, the CAF1 complex, and the larger DNA/protein
chromatin landscape it promotes, have the potential for driving sweeping changes in the way we understand
functional epigenetics and treat disease."

science research. He has developed multiple research collaborations nationally and internationally. His
laboratory works tightly with basic science (Cancer Biology, Cell biology, Microbiology, and
Statistics/Bioinformatics) and clinical (Pharmacology, Pathology, Surgery, and Gastroenterology) departments
on two intertwined objectives: to better understand the mechanisms of carcinogenesis and to develop novel
strategies for cancer prevention and treatment. He has made important contributions to these areas of research.
His laboratory also provides unique training experiences in cancer science, specifically on gastric and
esophageal tumors.
 Dr. Zaika leads an independent research program that is funded by the VA and NIH/NCI. His main
research interests are in cancer biology, molecular signaling, and host-pathogen interactions. Dr. Zaika’s
research utilizes various animal models, ex-vivo techniques, and human tissues as tools for studies of tumor
development and progression. For discovery and translational research, his laboratory employs single cell
RNA seq, ChiP seq, MALDI-TOF MS, CyTOF and other approaches. He has been successful in identifying the
molecular links between gastroesophageal reflux/esophageal adenocarcinoma and DNA damage/protein
adducts in the esophagus. His studies have also revealed the complex interactions between H. pylori pathogen
and host p53/p14ARF tumor suppressors, discovering novel targets for upper GI cancer prevention and
control.
 His pioneering work on protein adducts in the esophagus has demonstrated, for the first time, that
peroxidation of lipids caused by gastroesophageal reflux, which is a principal cause of Barrett’s esophagus and
esophageal adenocarcinoma, leads to accumulation of isolevuglandins-protein adducts that covalently modify
cellular proteins causing carcinogenic alterations. This innovative work opens new opportunities for prevention
and treatment of esophageal cancer with a new class of drugs termed isoLG scavengers. Zaika lab has also
made significant contributions to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the development
and progression of gastric cancer caused by Helicobacter pylori infection that is the strongest known risk factor
for gastric cancer. The groundbreaking work from his lab has shown that tumorigenic variants of H. pylori alter
mRNA splicing of p53 tumor suppressor producing short inhibitory isoforms of p53 protein, thereby facilitating
progression of gastric cancer. He was also the first who describe proteasomal degradation of p14ARF tumor
suppressor by H. pylori, as a bacterial mechanism responsible for inactivation of the oncogenic stress response,
a pivotal cellular pathway, that protects human cells against cancerogenic transformation.
As a professor of Surgery, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Dr. Zaika oversees the research development,
mentors junior faculty, and participates in research training of residents and fellows at University of Miami and
Miami VA. Dr. Zaika has trained more than 30 personnel that included undergraduate and graduate students,
postdocs, and residents. He has mentored junior faculty members, many of whom have progressed to
independent faculty positions.
 Cancer is a very complex disease(s). To defeat cancer, scientific interactions between cancer researchers
are critically needed. As such, Dr. Zaika’s laboratory collaborates with many researches from academic
institutions and cancer centers worldwide that span Europe, Asia, and Latin America. Dr. Zaika has a firm belief
that clinical and translational research founded on strong basic science discoveries is the way to win our battle
against cancer."
10894748,"Abstract
Acute leukemia is the most common childhood cancer, and remains one of the leading causes of death in children
under 15 years of age. Prevention, therefore, remains the ultimate goal. An essential part of future preventive
efforts will involve identifying children harboring preleukemic clones at birth. Several leukemia-initiating genetic
lesions have been shown to arise prenatally; however, many other leukemia-initiating lesions have not been
examined at birth. Several critical questions remain to be answered: 1) What subtypes and what proportion of
childhood leukemia develops in utero? 2) What is the specific cell(s) of origin in which preleukemic clones arise?
and 3) Are some newborns more prone to developing leukemia-initiating lesions than others? In this project, we
will answer these questions, with a focus on the ~70% of patients with known translocation or point mutation driver
events. This project has three main aims. Aim 1: To identify the presence and clonal frequency of prenatal
leukemia-initiating lesions at birth. We will obtain matched cord blood (CB) and diagnostic leukemia samples from
~250 childhood leukemia patients in the Children’s Oncology Group Project:Every Child study. Backtracking will
focus on ~182 patients with translocation/mutation-driven subtypes. We derive patient-specific somatic mutations
from tumor profiling, then use droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) in flow-sorted CB cells to confirm the presence and
frequency of leukemia-initiating lesions at birth, and at different hematopoietic stages. We will also use ddPCR to
backtrack lesions in available newborn dried bloodspots (N ~45). Aim 2: To determine the cell of origin of leukemia-
initiating lesions, the transcriptomic changes from preleukemia to overt leukemia, and whether secondary
mutations arise prenatally, across childhood leukemia subtypes. In 50 childhood leukemia patients where CB
ddPCR is positive we will conduct single-cell TARGET-seq on flow-sorted cell populations to simultaneously detect
the presence of each patient-specific leukemia-initiating events, secondary mutations, and gene expression in
genotypically- and immunophenotypically-defined populations at a single cell level. Aim 3: To determine whether
the presence and frequency of preleukemic clones correlate with known risk factors for leukemia. Demographic,
perinatal, and genetic risk factors for childhood leukemia will be obtained through parental survey, birth records,
and sequencing data. For overall ALL and AML, and for common subtypes, we will test for association between
risk factors and the presence and clonal frequency of preleukemic clones at birth, as measured in Aim 1. Identifying
a specific cell of origin of preleukemic genomic alterations, and their frequency in neonatal blood, will shed light on
childhood leukemia etiology and have important implications for precision prevention efforts. This study will identify
key steps required for leukemogenesis by directly comparing the genetic and transcriptomic architecture of
preleukemic CB to the subsequent full-blown leukemia. Results will provide a platform for development of large-
scale population testing of preleukemic clones in healthy newborns and will enable the first cohort studies
examining progression from pre- to overt leukemia."
10915700,"Mental illnesses are complex, affected by stressors and metabolic factors and involve changes to multiple
behavioral components and decision-making processes. Thousands of genetic variants with small effects are
typically involved. Thus, we lack a coherent genetic, cellular and evolutionary model for understanding and
modifying important behavioral components affecting decision-making, activity and stress. If such a
fundamental model of control could be uncovered for conserved, naturalistic behavior, our capabilities
for understanding and therapeutically modifying behavioral disorders would be improved. Foraging has
been studied for decades to uncover the basic principles and mechanisms of decision-making. Studies
typically use simplified binary choice tests. However, we recently published a naturalistic foraging assay and
unsupervised machine-learning methods to study complex, naturalistic decision patterns in mice. We
discovered that foraging is composed of reproducible, genetically controlled behavioral sequences that we call
“modules”. Using these methods, we investigated roles for maternally and paternally imprinted genes in
controlling naturalistic decision patterns in males and females. Canonical imprinting involves complete
silencing of one parent’s allele; however, we previously described genes with “noncanonical imprinting effects”
that involve parental allele expression biases at the tissue level. We now have evidence that noncanonical
imprinting effects at the tissue level involve allele silencing in subpopulations of cells. Moreover, we uncovered
important roles for noncanonical imprinting effects in controlling naturalistic foraging and risk-reward-effort
decision patterns. Currently, we do not fully understand the behavioral roles for different noncanonical
imprinted genes. MEGs (maternally expressed genes) and PEGs (paternally expressed genes) are postulated
to have opposing functional roles, suggesting an enticing genetic and evolutionary model of mammalian
decision control. Imprinting effects in different cell populations could regulate the form, expression, timing
and/or sequential order of different behavioral components of foraging. Therefore, our proposed study tests
the hypothesis that noncanonical MEGs and PEGs have opposing effects on discrete behavioral
components of naturalistic foraging and their cell-type specific imprinting effects reveal cell
populations controlling discrete behaviors. In Aim 1, we will determine how MEGs and PEGs co-expressed
with Th (tyrosine hydroxylase) and Ddc (dopa decarboxylase) in monoaminergic brain cells affect naturalistic
decisions. In Aim 2, we will define functional links between discrete cell populations with imprinting effects for
particular genes and discrete behavioral components of naturalistic foraging and decision patterns. Our
proposed study is significant because it will help define an important genetic, cellular and evolutionary model of
behavioral and decision control. Our long-term objective is to define a new conserved mechanistic model of
control over decision patterns that helps delineate targets for therapeutically modifying human behavior."
10908408,"Project Summary/Abstract
Adaptive immune response, brain development, and tumor progression all display physiology that
depends on somatic mutations and genomic rearrangements among interacting cells. There is
currently no widely-available tool to capture nucleotide-level variation in a tissue’s three-
dimensional context. In my lab, we are developing spatial-genetic technologies to bridge this
major technological gap.
DNA microscopy, an imaging modality that I developed for generating spatial-genetic maps of
tissue de novo (Weinstein, Regev, Zhang, Cell 2019) provides a critical foundation for this work.
DNA microscopy encodes the spatial positions and nucleotide-level differences of cells into the
DNA products of a stand-alone chemical reaction. The technology operates by first tagging
individual DNA and RNA molecules with unique DNA barcodes, and then turning these barcoded
molecules into an intercommunicating network: linking barcodes to one another at rates that
depend on the distance between the original molecules. In doing so, DNA microscopy uses DNA
as an imaging medium, effectively imaging a specimen from the “inside-out”.
My lab’s research has two thrusts. The first of these is aimed at exploiting the fact that DNA
microscopy image-capture is intrinsically volumetric, and applying it to deep-tissue three-
dimensional spatial-genetic imaging. The second thrust of our research is aimed at using the
phylogenetic relationships encoded into the DNA of proliferating cells, via genomic mutations and
other forms of stochastic genomic reorganization, in order to ultimately decode from their
genomes information about cellular dynamics through time. Our goal is to use DNA microscopy’s
capability to jointly resolve cellular positions and cell clonal relationships to reconstruct their
spatial and temporal dynamics in model organism development. We further aim to apply this
framework to deepen our understanding of genomic variability in tumors and immune cells in
mammalian tissue. In this proposal, I describe our plan to achieve both of these goals, and to
establish a foundation for DNA microscopy to be deployed as a critical tool for spatial-genetic
imaging in both basic biology and pathology."

The main objectives of the Vision Research Core are to enhance the productivity and efficiency of the research
programs of the UW vision scientists and to facilitate collaboration among investigators. The Functional
Analysis of the Visual System and In Vivo Ocular Imaging Core Module enhances productivity and efficiency
by providing access to shared equipment and facilities that are used by multiple labs. Shared equipment is cost
effective when multiple labs have need for the same expensive technology, but individual labs lack the
resources to purchase the technology, to support personnel with the necessary technical expertise to use or
maintain equipment, or are unable to make full time use of such technology. Structural analyses of the eye
using in vivo ocular imaging and functional analyses of the visual system with in vivo and ex vivo
electrophysiological and psychophysical methods are fundamentally important for modern basic and
translational vision research. This core module provides specialized support for these analytical approaches
through access to shared instruments and to technical expertise in the acquisition and analysis of data. The
shared instruments and technical expertise offered by this module expands the capacity of UW vision
researchers in the structural and functional analysis of the visual system, which in turn facilitates sharing of

10856919,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been linked to a variety of chronic mental health problems in veterans. A
striking feature in the most recent veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan has been the overlap between
a history of blast-related mild TBI (mTBI) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In many symptoms that
follow mTBI persist and evolve into a chronic postconcussion syndrome. In addition, in some new symptoms
develop or old symptoms progress and mounting evidence suggests TBI is a risk factor for later development
of neurodegenerative diseases. In collaboration with a Department of Defense investigator, Dr. Stephen
Ahlers, we have been studying a rat model of blast overpressure injury that was developed to mimic a blast-
related human mild TBI or subclinical blast exposure. Blast-exposed rats exhibit chronic cognitive and PTSD-
related behavioral traits including altered fear learning. These traits are present for over one year after blast
exposure and develop in a delayed and progressive manner. Fear learning has been extensively studied in
rodents for its relevance to PTSD. Blast-exposed rats thus provide a model for how a physical injury alters fear
responses. An mGluR2/3 antagonist improved blast-related behavioral traits including reverting altered fear
learning. We later found mGluR2 elevated in a time dependent manner that correlated with the blast-related
behavioral phenotype's appearance. Here building on insights that we have developed from over a decade of
study of this model, we will explore how blast affects the expression and pathobiology of fear leaning. In
Specific Aim 1 we will explore how in a time dependent and region-specific way blast exposure alters mGluR2
related signaling and synaptic protein formation during Pavlovian fear learning. These studies will in particular
test the hypothesis that development of PTSD-related behavioral traits following blast exposure involves a
degenerative process that preferentially affects hippocampus and involves altered mGluR2 related signaling
and synaptic protein formation. We will study fear learning in rats at 6 weeks (before altered fear responses
develop) and 8 months (after altered fear responses appear) following blast exposure. Studies will include
male and female rats treated with the mGluR2/3 antagonist LY341495. Specific Aim 2 will examine how in a
time dependent and region-specific way blast exposure alters the anatomic activation pattern of immediate
early genes during Pavlovian fear learning as well as whether dendritic spines and their dynamic remodeling
are affected. This aim will provide the anatomic correlates to test the hypothesis that blast injury preferentially
affects hippocampus. The mGluR2 dependence of blast effects on fear learning and expression will be
explored in Specific Aim #3 by knocking down mGluR2 on a regional basis using adeno viral associated
vectors (AAV). In specific aim #4 using single nuclei RNA transcriptomics we will explore why blast exposure
alters fear learning including why an mGluR2/3 antagonist rescues blast effects on fear learning and whether
tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα)-related signaling may be involved. Collectively, these studies will examine the
anatomic and molecular basis for why blast exposure affects fear responses using a rat model, which mimics
human mTBI or subclinical blast exposure."
10893008,"Neurochemical messengers like serotonin, dopamine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid have been linked to anxiety for decades, and yet these compounds are largely produced in the gut, both by intestinal cells and by gut microbes (aka enteroneuroactivity). However, the extent to which the gut contributes to the mechanism of neurotransmitter dysregulation in child anxiety remains poorly understood. The long-term goal of this project is to investigate the microbiome-gut-brain axis, how it is shaped in childhood, and how it contributes to early life neurodevelopment. The overall objective is to elucidate the effect of microbe-epithelial interactions on the form and function of gut epithelia in juvenile non-human primates (NHPs) that display anxiety-like behavior induced by maternal high fat diet (mHFD). Preliminary data in mHFD-exposed NHP juveniles demonstrate a) altered serotonin and dopamine in the brain, b) reduced serotonin in mHFD-microbe treated gut epithelia, and c) a persistently-altered gut microbiome. The central hypothesis is that ongoing microbe-epithelial interactions are required to perpetuate the altered enteroneuroactive function in the mHFD-exposed NHP gut. To better understand the in vivo associative data, the rationale for this project is to generate mechanistic data in vitro through the cultivation of enteroids and colonoids derived from control and mHFD-exposed NHPs. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursing two specific aims that will characterize the cellular enteroneuroactive functional status and compositional form of enteroids/colonoids in the absence and presence of reintroduced gut microbes. Under the first aim, enteroids/colonoids derived from control and mHFD-exposed NHPs will be cultured with and without microbes and compared for enteroneuroactive compound and enzyme levels (function). For the second aim, enteroids/colonoids will be compared for enteroneuroactive cell types and receptors (form). Together this analysis will determine if the enteroneuroactive profile witnessed in vivo is replicated in vitro with or without microbes. The trainee’s environment is perfectly primed to accomplish these aims via the enteroid core of Baylor College of Medicine, the metabolomics laboratory of the Texas Children’s Microbiome Center, and the longstanding NHP model of the Aagaard lab. The research proposed in this application is aimed to enhance the trainee’s career path towards a dynamic, multidisciplinary specialization in the fields of microbiology, gastroenterology, and neurology with the goal of becoming an academic pediatrician- scientist. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to determine the necessity of ongoing microbial-host interactions on the form and function of enteroneuroactivity in the context of anxiety. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to identify the critical components involved in childhood neurobehavioral development."

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related deaths in the United States and the World. We recently
demonstrated that programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) inhibitors, which lead to durable responses in a minority of
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, have greater efficacy in patients with charged HLA-B binding
pockets whose tumors harbor mutation(s) leading to what we have designated as motif neoepitopes. Motif
neoepitopes have an amino acid substitution in the second position of a nonamer generating a change in charge
from the wild type peptide with the resultant amino acid having a charge opposite from the HLA-B binding pocket.
To date, the immunological changes induced by motif neoepitopes have not been explored. We propose a
comprehensive evaluation of the underlying mechanism, focusing on patients with HLA-B44 supertype alleles
because of the prevalence (approximately 40% of the population) and distribution of HLA-B44 across racial and
ethnic groups. We will evaluate HLA-B44 samples in the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) to explore differences in
the tumor microenvironment (TME) among patients with or without motif neoepitopes by examining gene
expression and cellular composition by slide review and algorithms based on gene expression profiles. We will
evaluate surgical specimens from treatment naïve patients with or without HLA-B44 motif neoepitopes and
evaluate spatial signatures of the TME by multiplex immunofluorescence (MIF). We will assess multiple sections
from each specimen to identify biomarkers most significantly associated with motif neoepitopes. We will further
examine immune contextures of the TME associated with motif neoepitopes by single cell RNA-seq analysis.
To elucidate the predictive value of motif neoepitopes in early and advanced stage NSCLC patients and to
assess relevant clinical questions, we will perform analyses of patients in three separate clinical scenarios. As
whole exome sequencing (WES) and transcriptomic data is now routinely obtained in our NSCLC patients as
part of patients’ clinical care, we will analyze the presence and expression of genes harboring motif neoepitopes.
We will evaluate baseline tumor biopsies from 75 early stage patients with an HLA-B44 allele who receive
neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus PD-1 inhibition, correlating motif neoepitopes with pathologic complete
response. Among 75 advanced stage patients with an HLA-B44 allele who are receiving single agent PD-1
inhibition and 75 additional patients being treated with chemotherapy plus PD-1 inhibition, we will correlate motif
neoepitopes with progression of disease within 6 months of initiation of therapy.
Together, these studies will provide a better understanding of the TME and other immunologic changes
associated with the presence of motif neoepitopes. In addition, results could enable us to identify patients in
whom evaluation of this marker of neoantigen presentation could be utilized to select patients with clinically
relevant benefit in three separate clinical scenarios utilizing PD-1 inhibitor-based therapy. As a corollary, results
could also identify populations of patients in whom other treatment strategies should be considered."

 Thyroid hormones (TH) play a critical role in development. In the embryo, plasma T3 is relatively low but
TH signaling can be enhanced by expression of Dio2, the deiodinase that mediates local T3 production. The
timing of the D2-T3 activation varies among tissues, e.g. embryonic day 17 (E17) in brown adipose tissue
(BAT), or post-natal day 15 in the cochlea (P15). During the last funding period we discovered a D2-T3 peak in
the developing liver (P1-P2), coincidental with the C/EBPa-induced maturation of hepatoblasts to hepatocytes;
Dio2 expression in liver is silenced thereafter. By creating a liver-specific Dio2KO mouse (Alb-D2KO) we made
the fascinating discovery that inactivation of the D2-T3 peak modifies the liver transcriptome of the adult
mouse, with reduced expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism. The adult Alb-D2KO mouse exhibits a
dramatic phenotype of reduced susceptibility to obesity, liver steatosis and hyperlipidemia. How could a brief
perinatal peak of D2-T3 activate TH receptors (TR) and produce these changes? Hepatocytes undergo massive
postnatal epigenetic reprogramming, including changes in the DNA methylation status, some of which we now
know depend on D2-T3. We identified 1,508 CpG sites of DNA hypermethylation (H-sites) in the adult Alb-
D2KO liver genome. Thus, the perinatal D2-T3 peak ultimately affects the chromatin packing status and
transcriptional activity of adult hepatocytes, reducing the expression of 1,525 genes (RNA-seq). The proposed
studies are to identify the epigenetic mechanisms initiated by the perinatal D2-T3 peak in the liver. This is
absolutely novel and exciting as we will learn how deiodinase-mediated TH signaling affects liver development,
shaping gene expression in the adult organ."

Emerging genomic medicine initiatives are poised to impact prenatal and pediatric diagnostics, including
assessment of fetal structural anomalies (FSAs) from amniocentesis and the rapid adoption of non-invasive
prenatal screening (NIPS). Indeed, the rapid decrease in whole-genome sequencing (WGS) costs and the
improved sophistication of analytic genomics methods has brought prenatal screening to a critical inflection point.
Ongoing studies find improved diagnostic yields from WGS and whole exome sequencing (WES) over
conventional karyotype and microarray (CMA); however, the technical, analytical, and interpretative challenges
presented by structural variants (SVs) continue to confound sequence-based diagnostics. The field lacks
standardized methods to interpret SVs from WGS and WES, yet these variants underlie a significant fraction of
prenatal diagnoses, particularly for high risk fetuses with multiple congenital anomalies (MCAs). Our clinical SV
program was initially formed to nucleate expertise in technology and algorithm development, variant
interpretation, maternal-fetal medicine, and large-scale references to explore the impact of high-resolution SV
detection in prenatal diagnostics. This resubmission builds upon the methods, resources, and discoveries from
those studies to establish uniform approaches to jointly discover and interpret SVs, initially from amniocentesis
and ultimately using non-invasive methods. We will focus on MCAs as exemplars of genomic diagnostics in
severe clinical referrals. The discoveries from our initial funding period collectively suggest several critical
advances could transform prenatal screening and genetic diagnostics, and we directly address three major
barriers to these advances in this renewal: (1) Diagnostic yields from WES in FSAs are highly variable due to
inconsistent methods and limited sensitivity to capture SVs. Aim 1 will benchmark diagnostic yields from
WGS in MCA cases using our standardized open-source pipelines. (2) The genes contributing to the most
severe fetal anomalies in humans remain largely unknown, as studies of MCAs have mostly been restricted to
small cohorts and low-resolution CMA methods. Aim 2 will aggregate these severe fetal anomalies and
perform uniform variant detection and joint association analyses of short variants and SVs from WES and
WGS in FSA trios across multiple consortia, which we will compare to population-scale aggregated controls. (3)
NIPS is ultra-low resolution and fails to capture most causal variant classes underlying MCAs. Aim 3 will
benchmark an innovative approach to detect coding mutations and SVs from cffDNA, comparing yields to
current NIPS and amniocentesis as the standard-of-care. Our team will thus leverage complementary expertise,
novel methods, and unique patient resources to advance routine genomic screening in prenatal diagnostics."

 We propose to develop a blood-based test whose indicated use is to complement mammography in the early

Approximately one in seven breast cancers goes undetected despite screening mammography, and interval
cancers that manifest within a year of a normal mammogram remain a vexing problem, especially (although not

10840806,"Project Summary
 Disorders of sexual development (DSDs) encompass a variety of congenital conditions that present with
diverse phenotypes, such as virilization, gonadal dysgenesis, and delayed or absent puberty. In addition,
affected individuals often suffer from secondary effects, including gender dysphoria and physical issues such as
germ cell tumors and fertility disorders like polycystic ovarian syndrome or azoospermia. DSDs are the result of
genetic, developmental, or hormonal anomalies that arise during embryogenesis and persist throughout sexual
development and into adulthood. To better understand the etiology of DSDs, the role of RNA binding proteins in
sex determination has been investigated due to their functions in controlling gene expression via post-
transcriptional splicing, translational control, and mRNA localization. Identifying RNA binding protein RNA targets
and characterizing these regulatory relationships is essential to further our understanding of mechanisms
regulating sex determination. To study the events of sex determination and differentiation, our laboratory uses
zebrafish, a genetically tractable model with high fecundity and rapid external development. Therefore, this
powerful vertebrate system allows characterization of factors and pathways that are essential to reproductive
development, successful fertility, and establishment and maintenance of the female gonad. The aims herein will
identify conserved genes and mechanisms, that when disrupted, contribute to DSDs, fertility disorders, and
cancers in humans. Specifically, the aims of this proposal will investigate the factors and mechanisms regulating
sex-specific determination and differentiation in the context of a conserved vertebrate specific RNA binding
protein and its targets. Further, completion of these aims will provide rigorous training in all aspects of genetic
and molecular-based analyses, including generation, characterization, and validation of mutant and transgenic
zebrafish lines, genomic cloning, and microscopy, which will foster my development as a successful independent
investigator in the fields of developmental and reproductive biology."
10830256,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Most corticospinal fibers cross the midline to form the contralateral corticospinal tract (cCST). However,
approximately 10% of them project ipsilaterally to form the ipsilateral corticospinal tract (iCST). The iCST plays
a role in recovery from unilateral stroke or other forms of motor cortical injury by allowing the undamaged cortical
hemisphere to compensate for the damaged one. Despite the clinical importance of the iCST, its naturalistic
function and detailed anatomy are unknown. Individuals recovering from unilateral hemispheric injury experience
erroneous bilateral and symmetrical movements aptly termed “mirror movement disorders.” Transcranial
magnetic stimulation studies have linked the relative strength of the iCST and the severity of these mirror
movements. Furthermore, mutant animals with more robust iCSTs perform bilateral adaptive motor behaviors
more than wild-type animals. This evidence led to the hypothesis that the iCST is involved in the coordination of
bilateral behaviors.
This project uses a combination of viral tracing methods, chemogenetic behavioral experiments, single nucleus
sequencing, and sequencing-based neuronal reconstruction to test the hypothesis that the iCST coordinates
bilateral behavior. In preliminary data, a novel strategy is developed combining monosynaptic anterograde
tracing and single nucleus sequencing to map the postsynaptic targets of the iCST and cCST. Preliminary results
from this method suggested top-down differences in the architecture of the two tracts, with the iCST projecting
more so to interneurons involved in motor control and the cCST more so toward those involved in sensory
modulation. This lead to the hypothesis that the iCST comprises bilaterally-projecting corticospinal neurons.
Such bifurcated neurons would provide a structural justification for the link between the iCST and bilateral motor
behavior: bilateral neurons are naturally well-situated to facilitate bilateral behavior. With MAPSeq, a method of
anterograde viral tracing using molecular barcodes, as well as dual-fluorescence retrograde tracing, preliminary
data indicated that the iCST comprises primarily of bilaterally-projecting neurons. In addition to ensuring these
findings are robust, this project will directly investigate the role of the iCST in motor behavior by using
chemogenetic silencing of the iCST and markerless pose estimation in a well-established behavioral paradigm
of adaptive bilateral movement."
10827865,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Pediatric asthma is a major burden on child health, affecting 7% of American children (6 million children)
annually. Additionally, lung function in childhood is highly predictive of adult pulmonary morbidity. In utero and
early childhood exposure to metals, both essential (beneficial for health) and non-essential (harmful to health),
may shape respiratory health. Toxicologic evidence suggests prenatal and early childhood exposure to non-
essential metals causes oxidative stress, which disrupts normal immune system development and alters the
epigenome, a strong determinant of immune and lung development. The ubiquity of metals in the maternal and
child environments, and their modifiable sources in water, air, diet, and housing, imply potentially large public
health impacts. However, the few existing studies examining these associations have limitations: almost all
analyze metals individually rather than as a mixture, and consider only a single timepoint of exposure. The
proposed research utilizes data from Project Viva, a large, well-characterized pre-birth cohort of 2,128 mother-
child pairs recruited between 1999-2002 in eastern Massachusetts, to address these gaps. The proposed
research will assess impacts of metal mixture exposure in the first trimester and early childhood on: (1) blood
levels of total and allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) in early childhood, biomarkers of allergic
sensitization; (2) prevalent asthma in mid-childhood, and mediation of prenatal metal effects by early childhood
IgE; and (3) lung function in mid-childhood. The proposed research overcomes the limitations of prior work by
analyzing 14 metals jointly rather than individually, and distinguishing contributions of metal exposure in early
pregnancy vs. early childhood to immune system and lung pathology. Overall, this research will provide evidence
for interventions, such as dietary recommendations, to modulate metal exposure in order to promote respiratory
health, and suggest optimal time windows for such interventions. The training plan for the Fellowship applicant
was developed in collaboration with the sponsorship team, including Dr. Alan Hubbard (sponsor), Dr. John
Balmes (co-sponsor), and Dr. Andres Cardenas (co-sponsor), and centers on competency in causal inference,
the analysis of exposure mixtures, and subject area knowledge in children’s environmental health, such as
toxicology, asthma, and perinatal epidemiology. Coursework in these areas is enriched by attendance to
conferences, trainings, and workshops. Regular meetings with individual sponsors and the sponsorship team as
a whole will further facilitate training. The environment at the University of California, Berkeley is highly supportive
of this training, providing access to a diverse array of faculty and research collaborations in environmental
epidemiology, and abundant resources in statistical computing, scientific writing, career development, mentoring,
and advising. Overall, the training plan and environment will ensure the applicant matures into a productive and
innovative researcher in children’s environmental health."

 Advances in understanding the cancer genome have led to the development of novel therapeutics that
target distinct alterations in protein products of cancer DNA. The resulting targeted therapies, together with
protein-targeting immunotherapies, have led to significant advances in cancer patient survival. However, not all
patients benefit from these new therapies and instead many cancers continue to be treated with DNA double-
strand break (DSB)-generating radio- and chemo- therapies.
 Nucleic acid targeting approaches such as the CRISPR-Cas9 system now enable investigation of a new
modality for experimental cancer therapeutics: targeting DNA directly rather than its protein products. This
proposal is aimed at the initial investigation and evaluation of this modality.
 Hypothesis: Targeted induction of DNA DSBs at multiple rearrangement junctions, specific to the cancer
genome, can lead to cancer-cell specific cytotoxicity and spare damage to healthy tissue.
 Specific Aim 1. Characterize the landscape of cancer-specific Cas9-targetable genomic sites across
cancers and cancer cell lines. In this aim, a computational pipeline will be developed to characterize the spectrum
of Cas9-targetable genome alterations across the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia and Pan-Cancer Analysis of
Whole Genomes databases of over 300 cancer cell lines and 2500 cancer genomes. Sequence features that
may affect target effectiveness in cancer therapy will be characterized, including target clonality, target copy
number, and the distribution of targetable genomic alterations across cancer types. This pipeline will become a
publicly available tool to generate lists of Cas9-targetable rearrangement breakpoints for use in future studies.
 Aim 2. Develop methods to induce cytotoxicity in cancer cells using Cas9 targeted to cancer-specific
DNA rearrangement breakpoints. In a series of proof-of-principle experiments, this aim will assess whether Cas9
can induce targeted cell death through targeting DNA breaks to either single highly amplified sites or several
unique sites in the cancer neo-genome and whether this generates toxicity in healthy tissue.
 Aim 3. Identify protein factors responsible for resistance or sensitivity to Cas9-mediated DNA damage:
This aim will comprise a CRISPR knockout screen to discover proteins that affect cell sensitivity to multiple Cas9-
induced DNA breaks.
 This proposal will provide training in cancer genomics and targeted therapeutics under the guidance of
Professor Matthew Meyerson at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, who is experienced in both fields. In addition to
experimental and computational research, the applicant will present results at conferences, train future scientists,
and interact with colleagues and mentors in the cancer genomics, genome editing, and cancer therapeutics
fields. The planned research is intended to culminate in publication in peer-reviewed journals. Ultimately, this
training should prepare the applicant for a career as research faculty at a United States research institution."

 Human development relies on highly coordinated cell division, signaling, migration, and differentiation.
Any perturbations of the protein effectors that orchestrate these critical processes can lead to human birth defects
and/or diseases1-3. While our classical catalog contains around 20,000 proteins, evidence from ‘omics-based
techniques has generated a rapid paradigm shift in RNA biology4-12. Notably, RNA sequences defined as non-
coding in fact produce short proteins (£ 100 amino acids) called microproteins that modulate diverse processes13-
40 including heart function26, immunity22,27,41, and cell growth29,30. For example, a microprotein called APELA
maintains pluripotency in human embryonic stem cells20 and is critical for zebrafish heart development16,19.
However, additional microprotein function(s) during vertebrate development remain largely unknown.
 Zebrafish is an outstanding model for interrogating vertebrate gene function. Their genetic tractability
coupled with external, synchronous development is well-suited for developmental analyses. Further, hundreds
of microproteins have been identified across zebrafish development using ribosome profiling, mass-
spectrometry, and conservation analyses16,42. Remarkably, APELA is the only microprotein out of these 400 that
is currently characterized. A key barrier to further microprotein investigation is that a majority of messenger RNAs
(mRNA) during early development are maternally provided and can mask the effects of a targeted gene
disruption. Our novel CRISPR/Cas13d system43,44 overcomes this barrier because it actively degrades its target
mRNA and therefore enables selective knockdown of maternally provided mRNAs in zebrafish. My preliminary
experiments with CRISPR/Cas13d have revealed that knockdown of one microprotein mRNA inhibits zygotic
genome activation and disrupts posterior patterning.
 This study will combine CRISPR/Cas13d and ‘omics-based techniques to interrogate microprotein
function during zebrafish development. Aim 1 will leverage CRISPR/Cas13d to elucidate microproteins important
for early development. Then, Aim 2 will determine the cell and molecular processes that rely on developmental
microproteins. Together, these aims will define and characterize a population of microproteins involved in
vertebrate development. Experimental approaches will develop my skills in bioinformatics, molecular genetics,
developmental biology, and protein biochemistry. Microproteins critical for zebrafish development will be
informative for expanding the catalog of human proteins through comparative analyses. Further, microproteins
with functions during development represent uncharted therapeutic and/or diagnostic opportunities for human
birth defects and/or human diseases with developmental origins."

 The number of mental health concerns and emergency visits for suspected suicide attempts in youth
during 2021 has led to a declared national emergency by the American Academy of Child and Adolescent
Psychiatry. The consequences of major depressive disorder (MDD) onset during adolescence are substantial.
Adolescents with MDD are at higher risk for suicidality, the second leading cause of death in this age group, and
for developing additional mental health disorders in adulthood. Despite considerable efforts, efficacy of gold-
standard treatment for MDD remains low. For these reasons, research has aimed to identify early neurobiological
markers related to depression onset and severity. Progress in the field of neuroimaging has identified aberrant
reward circuitry (i.e., dampened activation in the reward system in anticipation or receipt of reward) as a potential
endophenotype for depression. However, reward processing is not limited to hedonics, and depression may be
better characterized by how diminished hedonics impact other aspects of the reward system, such as reward
learning. Previous literature supports the notion that MDD is associated with dampened reward-learning behavior
in adults; however, less is known about how adolescent reward-learning behavior may be impacted by MDD. Of
note, studying reward dysfunction and reward learning during adolescence is critical due to heightened reward
sensitivity and ongoing neuroplasticity occurring during this time. The goal of this proposal is to examine how
reward learning is impacted by MDD in adolescence, as well as how neurobiological mechanisms of reward
responsivity and reward circuitry predict future reward-learning behavior in adulthood. The first aim is to be the
first study to compare reward-learning behavior among adolescents and adults with and without MDD. Then,
capitalizing on an existing dataset, the second aim is to assess the associations between adolescent
neurobiological reward responsivity, resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) of the reward system, and task-
based functional connectivity and future reward learning. Filling the gap in our understanding of how reward
learning is impacted by MDD in adolescents and how neurobiological mechanisms of reward circuitry relate to
future reward-driven behavior may further our understanding of risk for depression and help to inform early
prevention efforts. Improved understanding of these mechanisms also may help to inform individualized
treatment strategies for youth based on individual neurobiology and behavior."

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) arises when gut microbes elicit inappropriate immune responses in the
intestine, leading to chronic inflammation and tissue damage. As cases rise worldwide, it is important to identify
the pathways that restrain these responses and promote mucosal healing. Critically, group 3 innate lymphoid
cells (ILC3s) are a recently identified cell type which is enriched in the healthy intestine and becomes
dysregulated during IBD, colon cancer and other chronic inflammatory disorders. Further, mouse models have
revealed fundamental roles for ILC3s in controlling immune tolerance, immunity, and inflammation in the
intestine. Despite these advances, the mechanisms by which ILC3s sense and respond to the intricate milieu of
signals present in the intestinal mucosa to coordinate intestinal health, impact inflammation, or promote tissue
healing remains unclear and represents an important area of future investigation. In new preliminary data, I have
unexpectedly determined that ILC3s are uniquely enriched in expression of a cell surface heparan sulfate
proteoglycan receptor, syndecan-4, a pathway linked to wound healing, cell migration/adhesion, and control of
growth factor signaling. Further, I identified a cellular and molecular mechanism regulating syndecan-4 on ILC3s
and discovered that syndecan-4 becomes dysregulated in experimental mouse models of intestinal inflammation
or human IBD. Finally, mice lacking ILC3-specific syndecan-4 show greater tissue damage and susceptibility to
intestinal inflammation. This provokes a novel hypothesis that syndecan-4 is a critical pathway impacting ILC3
biology, host-microbiota homeostasis, and tissue repair during intestinal health and inflammation. The
fundamental focus of this research proposal is to test this hypothesis and define the regulation and functional
significance of ILC3-specific syndecan-4 by employing novel mouse models, innovative technical approaches,
and translational studies. It is expected that the results from the two aims of this proposal will reveal crucial
signaling mechanisms for inflammatory responses in the intestine that may have therapeutic potential for the
treatment of IBD."

Program Coordinating Center (IIDP CC) for the next 5 years, to continue to provide distribution of human
cadaveric islets and ancillary tissue for biomedical research to researchers worldwide. Our proposal leverages
the significant investment made by NIH over the last 19 years that has established and successfully maintained
the IIDP at COH. From qualification and auditing of high-quality Islet Isolation Centers (IICs), to forecasting,
tracking, and meeting the needs of investigators, since 2002 our experienced team has worked with 20 different
islet isolation laboratories to coordinate the distribution of over 330 million islet equivalents to more than 400
investigators across 16 countries since 2002, supporting 767 peer reviewed publications. Through this renewal
we will continue to subcontract with our 5 highly qualified IICs to isolate and distribute human islets and ancillary
tissue via our advanced electronic Islet Allocation System (IAS). We will continue to manage the review process
for islet receipt, pilot studies, and Opportunity Pool funding. We will further enhance our IAS to broadcast offers
online and notify approved waiting researchers of islet availability, in a fair, equitable and time sensitive manner.
IIDP will continue to maintain the existing cost recovery system through subscription fees collected from islet
researchers, which has garnered a total of $9,303,950 since the implementation of subscription fees to offset
the expenses of pancreatic processing for the IICs. We will continue to closely monitor and help to improve the
quality of islets distributed, through the continuation of the Human Islet Phenotyping Program (HIPP) that
conducts assays on a sample from each islet isolation. IIDP has just added a Human Islet Genotyping Initiative
(HIGI) to genotype each isolation as well. Phenotyping and genotyping data, as well as UNOS data, extensive
donor and islet isolation data, will be made available to approved investigators through online access to the IIDP
Research Data Repository, with IIDP and NIDDK approval of applying scientists. Investigators can easily search
the required data, select filter criteria, save their searches, and download the integrated IIDP data for exploratory
analyses. Through our proven state-of-the-art administrative, business, technical, statistical, quality assurance,
and informatics processes and tools, the accessibility of human islets for investigators conducting essential
diabetes mellitus research will be secured. We will continue to provide an indispensable research resource for
the diabetes research community by ensuring that the IIDP remains stable, technologically advanced, continually
enhanced, and fully responsive to the islet needs of the research community, promoting the next generation of
scientific experimentation toward the prevention and treatment of diabetes."
11041467,"Title: Specificity, Phenotype and Function of Pancreatic CD8 T Cells in Human Type 1 Diabetes
Project Summary
Human type 1 diabetes (T1D) is characterized by the immune-mediated destruction of insulin-producing pan-
creatic beta cells. CD8 T cells are the most common cell found in insulitis lesions and are the principal T cell
type implicated in beta cell destruction. Insulin and its precursors have been identified as key autoantigens in
humans and mice due to their local abundance. The previous funding cycles for this grant have enabled us to
lead the field of human islet cell investigation in T1D. Using samples from the national pancreatic organ donor
consortium (nPOD) we have detected, precisely quantified, and identified the exact location of autoreactive
pre-proinsulin (PPI) specific CD8 lymphocytes within the pancreata of human donors. Studies performed within
this project have already revealed significant and novel findings. We first identified auto-reactive CD8 T cells
in the islets of patients with T1D using a specially designed method of tetramer staining. We found that their
frequency is high and likely the most predominant autoreactive cell type (1), a finding which has been inde-
pendently confirmed with other methods by Nakayama et al. (2). More recently (3) we defined the precise
location of these cells within a pseudo-timeline of disease development and concluded that PPI cytotoxic T
lymphocytes (CTL) are already present in healthy pancreata and appear to become 'attracted' to islets during
the development of T1D. This seminal observation indicates that the islets appear to expose themselves to
immune recognition, and thus become a key culprit in driving T1D development. A new key development of
this grant is the Orion (Rarecyte) technology that allows for highly multiplexed studies in whole tissue sec-
tions, combined with state-of-the-art analysis software. The study of the whole section and multiple targets
simultaneously allows to define the islet/immune interface and the communication between PPI CTL and other
immune cells more precisely and with a much reduced number of samples. The present proposal will define
the precise location and function of these interactions, and corroborate these findings in highly innova-
tive human islet microtissues and living donor pancreatic tissue slices using dynamic in vitro models.
Finally, this proposal will decipher mechanistically how some aspects of the islet immune interface can be
reset/restored by the action of GLP1 agonists, building on our recent work which has shown that this drug
class can maintain beta cell function (glucose-induced insulin secretion) in vitro and in vivo during the devel-
opment of T1D (4). Overall, our findings should give us an unprecedented and unique understanding of how
and why T1D develops, and provide mechanistic information using our novel in vitro systems, thus ultimately
aiding the development of new therapeutic options."
10810725,"Despite the improved short-term outcomes in kidney transplantation (KT), comparable progress in long-term
allograft survival has not been achieved. Chronic allograft dysfunction (CAD) characterized by interstitial fibrosis
and tubular atrophy (IFTA), accounts for one quarter of transplant kidneys lost within 5 years. Preventing kidney
graft dysfunction and loss is a critical unmet need in transplantation. From reported evidence, posttransplant
graft survival is determined by the complex interplay of donor factors, acute peri-transplantation injury, and
kidney transplant recipient factors. We recently reported that the transcriptome of deceased donor kidneys
encompasses a gene signature at the time of KT that predicts long-term graft function. These signatures shed
light on the inherent donor mechanisms responsible for triggering and likely sustaining posttransplant injury.
Furthermore, although a recipient peripheral blood transcriptional signature was recently reported as a predictor
of early acute rejection, the effect of pretransplant KT recipient peripheral blood transcriptional profiles on long-
term outcomes has not been previously tested. Moreover, there are no comprehensive biological markers
from donors and recipients that can be used pretransplant to predict graft outcomes. Given the multifactorial
nature of CAD, our preliminary data, and the gaps in our knowledge, we have the unique ability to fill these unmet
needs by studying the early stressors that lead to kidney graft fibrosis deploying an unbiased comprehensive
approach. Towards this goal, we have already established a cohort with prospective sequential sampling of
kidney allografts. In our studies, donor kidneys were evaluated at pre-implantation and recipient pretransplant
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected. The recipient cohort also includes longitudinal
PBMCs, protocol biopsies, and detailed clinical metadata, allowing for the correlation of gene expression profiles
with histological features and clinical parameters. In this exploratory proposal, we hypothesize that early cellular
and molecular events in the donor kidney trigger local inflammatory responses that, when combined with
recipient immune state, propagate and sustain posttransplant kidney injury leading to graft loss. Specific aims
(SA) include: SA1 (1) Identify kidney transplant recipient preimplantation peripheral blood molecular profiles that
associate with immune activation vs quiescence and determine posttransplant graft function. (2) Discern
longitudinal posttransplant molecular variations in patient's PBMCs that associate with long-term graft function.
SA2 Integrate kidney donor and recipient peripheral blood gene expression profiles in association with
donor/recipient clinical characteristics for constructing a composite score to predict long-term outcomes.
IMPACT: Results of these studies will provide a unique understanding of the early molecular triggers that
determine graft outcomes and ultimately lead to CAD. Novel prognostic biomarkers will enable the early
identification of patients at higher risk for progression to CAD, allowing for the development of new therapeutic
modalities that have the potential to avoid irreversible graft injury and improve long-term outcomes."

Relapse is the most important cause of mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (allo-HCT), but
little research progress has been made in several decades. Chimeric antigen receptors targeting CD19 (CD19
CARs) redirect T cell effector functions to eliminate CD19-expressing leukemia and lymphoma cells. However,
many patients still relapse. The candidate has preclinical data indicating the feasibility of using genome editing
to delete the endogenous T cell receptor (TCR) to reduce the alloreactivity of donor CD19 CAR T cells, but it is
unknown how these TCR knockout (KO) cells will function in vivo as anti-tumor agents, to what extent graft-
versus-host-disease (GVHD) will result, or how engineering impacts T cell metabolism. This knowledge is
essential for progress toward creating readily available “off-the-shelf” CAR T cells for patients with hematologic
malignancies. The overall objectives of the proposed research are to determine how donor and third-party TCR
KO CD19 CAR T cells impact immune reconstitution, GVHD, and graft rejection in preclinical models, as well as
to understand how removing the TCR impacts the immunometabolism of these cells. The central hypothesis is
that potent anti-tumor effects as well as negligible GVHD and graft rejection can be demonstrated preclinically
by using TCR KO CD19 CAR T cells (either donor or third-party) following allo-HCT, to produce superior
outcomes to conventional CD19 CAR T cells following allo-HCT. This hypothesis will be tested in the proposed
Specific Aims.
This work will provide ideal training for the candidate as she prepares for her long-term career goal to lead an
independent laboratory studying cellular therapeutics and allo-HCT. Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center
has a renowned immunology program, and Dr. Marcel van den Brink, the candidate’s primary mentor, is a leader
in immunotherapy research. Her co-mentor and advisory committee members have diverse and complementary
expertise, and all have strong track records of mentoring independent scientists. The candidate and her
mentoring team have developed a rigorous training plan designed to increase her knowledge base in: 1)
development of next-generation CAR T cells; 2) bioinformatics and programming; 3) cellular metabolism,
metabolic flux, mitochondrial function, and metabolic analyses in CAR T cells; and 4) professional development
skills. The candidate will undertake training in these areas through coursework, workshops, and mentorship.
This research project and training will provide the foundation to establish her future career as an independent
physician-scientist. The proposed studies are expected to generate findings that will guide future genome
engineering of CAR T cells. The candidate’s aim is to launch an independent research program designing “off-
the-shelf” CAR T cells, which are expected to provide much improved therapeutic options for a range of
hematologic malignancies."
10802401,"Project Summary/Abstract
The obesity epidemic has increased the prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, which ranges from
clinically benign hepatic steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The latter represents a more severe
disease state featured by the presence of chronic liver injury, inflammation, and liver fibrosis, which increases
the risk for end-stage liver disease such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Macrophages play
an integral role in host defense, tissue homeostasis, and disease progression. Altered macrophage
polarization, characterized by changes in its transcriptional and functional states, has been causally linked to
the pathogenesis of metabolic disease including NASH. Despite this, the nature of macrophage heterogeneity,
disease-associated reprogramming, and its contribution to NASH progression remains obscure. To address
these challenges, we recently performed single-cell RNA sequencing analysis on liver cells isolated from
healthy and diet-induced NASH mice. Our study uncovered a unique population of NASH-associated
macrophages (NAMs) that exhibits strong association with mouse and human NASH. Several important
questions emerge from these findings regarding the pathophysiological signals that trigger NAM induction, its
role in NASH pathogenesis, and the underlying mechanisms. Based on a body of preliminary data, we
hypothesize that intrahepatic pathogenic stimuli drive NAM induction during NASH, thereby reshaping the liver
microenvironment and exacerbating disease progression. In this proposal, we plan to elucidate the signaling
pathways that promote NAM induction and critically assess its role in disease pathogenesis. We plan to
explore the mechanisms through which NAMs contribute to the reprogramming of the liver microenvironment."
10906057,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the vulnerability of the nearly 1.4 million nursing home (NH) residents
to respiratory healthcare associated infections (HAI) such as COVID-19. By August 2020, there were nearly
200,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with more than 50,000 reported resident deaths. NH residents are
vulnerable to respiratory HAI because of multiple comorbidities and physical and cognitive frailty. These
vulnerabilities are compounded by an institutional environment of common caregivers, shared living spaces,
and a setting with a history of being under-resourced and ill-prepared to manage infection outbreaks. While
COVID-19 related NH infections and mortality continue to increase nationwide, no one has reported on the
impact of COVID-19 on NHs’ capacity to respond to the pandemic and to understand the impact of their
response on clinical, functional, and psychosocial resident outcomes jointly.
 We are proposing a longitudinal mixed-methods study with the goal to develop knowledge and
recommendations to improve US NHs’ ability to respond to respiratory HAI outbreaks. We have unique access
to data recorded by the Quality Improvement Program for Missouri (QIPMO), a state-sponsored cooperative
program. In March 2020, QIPMO began documenting NH COVID-19 infections and support provided to
Missouri NHs. By June, there were over 2,400 documented QIPMO encounters providing us an unprecedented
opportunity to study how NHs responded to COVID-19. In aim 1, we will use QIPMO data, state key informant
interviews, and interviews with over 300 leaders and staff from 24 purposively sampled NHs to assess diverse
NH pandemic responses, including enactment of federal guidance. In aim 2, using an interrupted time-series
analysis, we will leverage statistical data from the Minimum Data Set (MDS) to determine the effects of the
COVID-19 response on NH resident clinical, functional, and psychosocial outcomes. In aim 3, we will converge
findings from aims 1 and 2 to identify relationships between contextual differences in NH responses and
resident health outcomes to describe practices and strategies that either mitigated or contributed to adverse
outcomes. Finally, in aim 4 we will convene an expert panel to review and recommend updates to current NH
HAI guidelines and identify new practices and strategies to enhance NHs’ capacity to respond to infectious
disease outbreaks including identifying implementation barriers, final dissemination plans and future
intervention development.
 The likelihood that COVID-19 will become endemic and create needs for ongoing management is growing.
Understanding how NHs’ responses influenced outcomes, including long-term resident effects, will inform
future intervention development for US NHs to systematically prepare and manage infectious disease
outbreaks. This study addresses the AHRQ priority to better prepare NHs for prevention and management,
specifically high-risk respiratory HAI illnesses like COVID-19."

The Immune Monitoring and Biospecimen (IMB) Core is a dedicated to provide the outstanding leadership and
expertise in immune monitoring and biospecimen sciences needed in this U19 to develop novel effective agents
that can cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) and test them in the clinic. Working collaboratively as a team the
investigators at University of California San Francisco and Northwestern University will acquire, process, and
analyze biospecimens from enrolled patients and from preclinical models for GBM. Many of the procedures
required to achieve these objectives are non-standard, requiring specialized knowledge and sophisticated
experimental analysis. In addition, the Core will provide histopathologic and molecular analyses of human glioma
xenografts, central histopathologic review, and ensure strict quality control in all aspects of biospecimen
handling. The Core will address these needs based on the following specific aims:
Specific Aims
1. To provide the staff and expertise for the acquisition and preservation of high-quality brain tumor patient
 biospecimens and preclinical models to meet the tissue accrual requirements for the projects and clinical
trials.
2. To provide routine and advanced tissue handling/processing and analytical techniques and expertise for
 human and murine tumors, including high-dimensional flow cytometry, multiplex immunoflourescence,
 Cytek, and single cell RNA sequencing, that will advance project hypothesis development and goal
attainment.

Despite preclinical promise and occasional long(er) term tumor growth control in subsets of patients, anti-PD1
checkpoint blockade (aPD1) has failed to improve outcome in glioblastoma (GBM). The failure to demonstrate a
benefit to an anti-PD1 antibody (aPD1) may be due to 1) an immunosuppressive microenvironment with few
immunogenic tumor cells; 2) insufficient aPD1 penetration across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which fail to
reach the infiltrating tumor cells in the peritumoral brain; and 3) molecular heterogeneity of GBM. Here we
systematically address each of these challenges. We aim to elicit robust anti-tumoral response to Balstilimab
(Agenus Bio), a novel aPD1 antibody by modulating the immune response by low doses of doxorubicin as has
been shown previously. To allow for adequate drug tissue penetration, we will transiently disrupt the blood-brain
barrier by a skull implantable ultrasound device (SonoCloud-9) in association with intravenous microbubbles
(US/MB). In our ongoing research and clinical trials we have shown the feasibility of this approach including
targeted biopsies of enhancing and non-enhancing tissue and measure drug tissue distribution. Lastly, we aim
at identifying molecular characteristics that will allow to predict a benefit from aPD1 immunotherapy based on
our prior work where we have identified MAPK activation (pERK staining) as a putative biomarker. We will firstly
refine the sequence of DOX & aPD1 administration in preclinical models. Second, for verification and
optimization we will treat a few pilot patients in the lead-in phase of our trial. Third, the optimized regimen will be
tested in a multi-cohort study in patients with recurrent GBM who will be treated by DOX and the aPD1 Balstilimab
(DOX+aPD1). Primary endpoints are tumor immune response in the resection specimen and/or peripheral
immune response, drug concentrations in enhancing and non-enhancing brain tissue (targeted biopsies at the
time of resection) and safety. Clinical outcome and biomarkers are secondary endpoints. Four cohorts of patient
will be examined where DOX/aPD1 treatment starts at different time points: Induction (neoadjuvant, prior to
resection); or intraoperatively upon resection, each with and without US/MB. A non-interventional standard of
care cohort will serve as control. Our proposal has 3 specific aims: SA1: Characterize & optimize the effect of
DOX + aPD1 on anti-tumoral immunity in GBM. SA2: Determine the effect of US/MB on the concentration of
DOX + aPD1 in the human brain and anti-tumoral immune response in GBM. SA3: Investigate whether tumor
pERK/MAPK activation predicts GBM response to DOX + aPD1. Successful completion will determine the i)
value of immune modulation by DOX and aPD1; ii) the value of induction (pre-resection) treatment and in vivo
evaluation of anti-tumor immune response; iii) the value (or absence thereof) of BBB-opening for aPD1 efficacy;
and iv) whether pERK predicts response and identifies patients that will benefit from treatment."
10910095,"Development of safe and effective (CAR)-transduced T cell (CART) therapy for glioblastoma (GBM) needs to
overcome multiple challenges, including on-target off-tumor toxicity, heterogeneity of antigen expression, and
exhaustion of CART cells. There are no GBM-specific surface antigens that are uniformly present in tumor
tissue. Mutant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFRvIII), for example, is GBM-specific but its expression is
heterogenous within the tumor. On the other hand, while non-mutant GBM-associated antigens (GAAs), such
as EphA2 and IL-13Rα2, are more uniformly expressed in GBM, their expression in other organs outside the
central nervous system (CNS) raises concern for off-tumor toxicity. As a way to safely and effectively target
GAAs, we have adopted a novel synthetic Notch “synNotch” receptor system and developed innovative T cells.
In this system, the first antigen, which is expressed exclusively on brain or GBM cells (e.g. EGFRvIII), primes
the T cells to induce expression of a CAR that recognizes IL-13Rα2 and EphA2, thereby eradicating GBM cells
expressing either EphA2 or IL-13α2. Our data show that EGFRvIII-synNotch primed IL-13Rα2/EphA2 CAR are
effectively but restrictedly activated by EGFRvIII as the GBM-specific signal, leading to complete eradication of
patient-derived xenografts with heterogeneous EGFRvIII expression but without attacking IL-13Rα2/EphA2-
positive cells outside of CNS. Furthermore, these synNotch-CAR T cells were significantly more efficacious
than conventional, constitutively expressed IL-13Rα2/EphA2 CAR T cells, and were associated with excellent
persistence (>100 days in vivo). Taken together, our data indicate that synNotch CAR T cells can revolutionize
the CAR T therapy for solid cancers by overcoming the off-tumor toxicity, antigen heterogeneity and lack of
persistence. Our goals are to establish the process for development of Good Manufacturing Practice
products of EGFRvIII-primed IL-13Rα2/EphA2 CAR T cells, to obtain an Investigational New Drug (IND)
approval, and to develop and conduct a phase I trial in patients with recurrent GBM. In Aim 1, we will
generate GMP-grade lentiviral vector and establish standard procedures for GMP-grade manufacturing of the
EGFRvIII-primed IL-13Rα2/ EphA2 CAR T cells. In Aim 2, we will complete both in vitro and in vivo studies that
are required for submission of an IND. In vitro studies include confirmation of antigen-specific priming, specific
cytotoxicity, and absence of replication competent lentivirus. In vivo, we will confirm preclinical efficacy,
toxicology, tissue biodistribution, and engraftment as well as persistence of synNotch CART cells. In Aim 3, in
a first-in-human phase 1 clinical trial, we will determine safety and toxicity of the synNotch CART cells in
patients with recurrent EGFRvIII+ GBM. In a subsequent expansion cohort, in patients with recurrent EGFRvIII+
GBM, we will infuse synNotch CART cells intravenously prior to surgery, and then evaluate infiltration, priming
and function of the infused cells in the resected GBM. These studies will allow us to determine optimal dosing
based not only on tolerability but also on pharmacodynamic assessments."

The Administrative Core A is designed to provide the basic operational underpinning to support the research
efforts of the Center. During Phase 1, the Center for Childhood Obesity Prevention (CCOP) was successful in
establishing two research cores, the Biostatistics Core B and the Metabolism and Bioenergetics Core C.
Building on this work, one additional research core will be established in Phase 2, the Community Engagement
Core D, to further strengthen and enhance the institutional research infrastructure for scientific inquiry into
pediatric obesity and related co-morbidities. The Administrative Core A will support the growth and
sustainability of the Center by guiding current and newly recruited junior investigators to develop independent,
extramurally funded research programs in the thematic focus of childhood obesity prevention using a team
science approach. Institutional scientific infrastructure will continue to be enhanced through investment in the
sustainability of the research cores, and building additional strategic institutional partnerships necessary to
support junior faculty career development, and create synergy for maximum collective impact in the field.
 Specific Aim 1: Provide administrative, scientific, and fiscal support to enhance and operate the
Center. This includes coordination of all administrative and research core functions, evaluation of junior
investigator projects, ongoing recruitment and development of pipeline investigator projects, mentoring and
career development activities, and tracking of scientific products and impacts. Effectiveness and progress of
Center programs will be assessed regularly through a comprehensive evaluation strategy. The focus in Phase
2 will be on establishing processes and products aimed at supporting long term sustainability of the Center.
 Specific Aim 2: Implement the Center operations plan. Provide the coordination of daily Center
operations including budget management, progress reporting, compliance with federal regulations, study
coordination and visit support, management of the pilot study RFA process, coordination of advisory committee
and operational meetings, and comprehensive data tracking.
 Specific Aim 3: Enhance the career development and scientific progress of the junior
investigators. Provide a robust Senior Mentoring program, accompanied by comprehensive training and
education, to support the development of emerging scientists as independently funded investigators using a
team science mission and approach."
10930063,"PROJECT SUMMARY 
Factors affecting the risk of obesity prior to adulthood occur at every level of influence represented in the socio- 
ecological model, with differing impact by age. Childhood obesity prevention therefore requires attention to 
effects on individuals embedded in a broader context of interpersonal relationships/families, organizations and 
institutions, communities, and public policy environments. Trustworthy engagement of parents and families, 
early childhood and school professionals, providers, organizations, and the broader community is critical to 
successful childhood obesity prevention research. An extensive body of literature exists to support such 
engagement and its positive impacts on health, and specifically on childhood obesity. To advance this 
approach the Center for Childhood Obesity Prevention (CCOP) proposes a new research Community 
Engagement (CE) Core. The overarching goal of the CE Core is to formally institute and provide services and 
activities that support Center investigators in effectively engaging communities in research to improve child 
health and prevent disease. This goal will be accomplished through the following three specific aims: 1) 
Develop the CCOP CE Core by establishing a seamless coordinated infrastructure to support investigators and 
community partners in child health research; 2) Provide child health focused CE services to investigators 
including CE Core and community consultations; community connections; and CE Core / community advising 
and assistance with partnership assessment, study design, recruitment, implementation, and dissemination; 
and 3) Build CE research capacity of investigators and community partners by customizing existing educational 
and training programs in child health research and providing mentoring on CE for Center investigators. Kate 
Stewart, MD MPH, Director, and Emily English, DrPH MPH MPS, Associate Director, will collaboratively lead 
the CE Core. The CE Core will engage institutional, advocacy, and agency partners who are leading childhood 
obesity prevention efforts in the state. These partners will identify research questions, increase access to 
program beneficiaries, and help to translate findings and sustain interventions. The CE Core will also establish 
a 15 member community advisory board (CAB) to advise the CCOP and Center funded investigators. The CAB 
will include community partners from populations and geographic areas of Arkansas with the greatest 
disparities from obesity and its determinants. CE Core services will include consultations; partnership 
development; community review boards; recruitment support; and assistance with developing project-specific 
CABs, with communication and dissemination of findings, and with evaluation of CE partnerships. The CE 
Core will also provide a CE Research 101 seminar, a Dos and Don’ts of CE workshop, and training for 
community members through the community scientist academy. CE Core services and training will lead to 
more relevant, effective, feasible, and impactful research to support improvement in child health."

Americans die of lung cancer each year. Despite our best treatment, efforts to cure lung cancer have failed in
most cases, partly due to an insufficient understanding of the biology of metastasis, which almost inevitably leads
to lung cancer death. Therefore, understanding better the mechanism regulating metastasis will allow us to gain
deeper insights into the disease basis, on which novel therapeutic strategies for treating metastatic lung cancer
can be developed and tested. On the basis of our preliminary studies, we posit that an autophagy related gene
plays a critical role in the regulation of lung cancer metastasis through a novel mitochondria associated
mechanism. The primary objectives of this proposal are to determine whether manipulating the expression of this
gene or its mitochondria associated function can inhibit the dissemination of lung cancer. As such, our studies
not only reveal a new basic mechanism for lung cancer, but have translational potentials. Because there are
about 2 million new lung cancer cases each year globally (World Health Organization statistics), our studies may
have a major impact on public health."

The incidence of infertility has increased 4% since the 1980s, with up to 20% cases having no known cause.
One of the prevailing hypotheses is incompatibility between cognate egg and sperm proteins; however, very
few pairs of interacting reproductive proteins have been identified in any organism. One of the best models for
studying core mechanisms of fertilization is the marine gastropod abalone, where sperm are highly enriched for
only a few proteins. The first identified pair of interacting reproductive proteins were abalone sperm lysin and
its egg coat receptor VERL. As a major component of the abalone egg coat, VERL is a giant, fibrous
glycoprotein composed of ~22 ZP-N repeats that likely form intermolecular hydrogen bonds to create the highly
stabilized and protective egg coat. Lysin creates a hole in the egg coat by competing for these hydrogen
bonds, allowing sperm to pass and fuse with the oocyte. These ZP-N repeats are also a principal component of
mammalian egg coats, and multiple lines of evidence support the human protein ZP2 as the functional analog
of VERL. However, three major outstanding questions are (1) besides lysin and VERL, which sperm and egg
proteins are interacting, (2) what sites in these proteins are important for mediating this interaction, and (3) how
might mutations in these sites impact protein structure and fertility. To address these fundamental questions of
reproduction in both abalone (K99) and humans (R00), two specific aims are proposed that utilize state-of-the-
art genomic, proteomic, and structural methods. In aim 1, for the K99 phase, I will combine long read
sequencing technology, tests for molecular evolution, and quantitative proteomics to identify potential pairs of
interacting reproductive proteins in abalone; for the R00 phase, I will extend these quantitative proteomic
methods to identify potentially novel pathways that contribute to male infertility. In aim 2, for the K99 phase, the
solution structure of VERL repeat 1 and its interactions with lysin will be determined by NMR, with deep
mutational scanning used to identify mutations that interfere lysin-VERL interactions. In the R00 phase, these
technologies will be applied to human ZP2 and I will identify mutations that interfere with sperm binding and
characterize their structural effects. The proposed research is innovative for its combined use of genomic,
proteomic, and structural techniques to characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions of
rapidly evolving reproductive proteins. The results are expected to shed insight into the core processes that
mediate egg-sperm interactions, and provide foundational information towards understanding the more
complex mammalian system."
10916340,"Periviable neonates, born between 22 0/7 - 24 6/7 weeks gestational age, cannot survive outside of the womb
without support. Even with support, 40% of these neonates die, and, among survivors, roughly half suffer
moderate to severe disability. These births are financially and emotionally costly to families, and all of these
burdens are most heavily born by Black families, as Black infants are 3 times more likely to be born extremely
premature. Because mortality is high and outcomes can be poor, the American Academy of Pediatrics calls for
shared decision making (SDM) when families face these decisions—so that parents are engaged in
deliberations, and, ultimately, choose whether to attempt resuscitation or pursue palliation. Our preliminary
research suggests that, despite these recommendations, the current model of periviable decision making is not
shared, well-informed, or patient-centered. Mortality and morbidity estimates provided are variable and
inaccurate; there is conflicting guidance regarding antenatal interventions; and goals of care or resuscitation
preferences are not always elicited. By presenting parents with inconsistent information without eliciting and
clarifying values and goals of care, providers place parents at substantial risk for misinformed decision making,
decisional conflict, and decisional regret. Our previous work also shows that poor decision quality is associated
with poor postpartum parental mental health. To optimize these high-stakes counseling encounters, we have
utilized a novel approach to design, in partnership with patient and clinician stakeholders, a decision support
intervention - the Periviable GOALS (Getting Optimal Alignment around Life Support) decision support tool
(DST). This DST is meant to facilitate informed SDM regarding neonatal resuscitation. Periviable GOALS DST
is designed for parents to review independent of their clinician, and is intended to supplement, not replace,
clinician counseling. The focus of the DST is the provision of patient-centered outcomes information and
assistance with values clarification regarding neonatal outcomes. With the completion of pilot testing, we are
ready to conduct a multisite, randomized controlled trial to test the effect of the Periviable GOALS DST on: a)
decision quality (i.e., shared decision-making, knowledge, decisional conflict, decision satisfaction, and
decision regret), b) mental health (i.e., depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress in the postpartum
period), and c) neonatal treatment preference (i.e., resuscitation or comfort care). We hypothesize that
participants who utilize the GOALS DST will have improved decision quality, particularly in regard to SDM
(primary outcome), and improved mental health outcomes. This work stands to improve the quality of
periviable care by ensuring more informed and patient-centered decision-making. Our methodology is
innovative, as we are offering patients a stronger voice in research design and, ultimately, clinical practice. Our
results will have immediate clinical relevance because the regional and institutional diversity of our trial sites
improves generalizability, allowing for broad application and dissemination of the DST."

In the United States, more than 1.5 million adults are hospitalized each year with community-acquired
pneumonia. Despite availability of high-quality guidelines for the treatment of patients with pneumonia,
guideline adherence remains poor and patient care is variable. Lack of objective risk assessment leads to
unnecessary hospital admissions and misallocation of scarce intensive care resources. Thus, there is a
critical need for well-designed clinical decision support (CDS) tools to assist clinicians with accurate
diagnosis and appropriate treatment for patients with pneumonia. Intermountain Healthcare developed
and deployed real-time electronic CDS (called ePNa) embedded in the Cerner electronic health record
(EHR) across 20 adult hospital emergency departments. ePNa gathers real- time and historical data from
the EHR combined with artificial intelligence processing of chest images (ChexED) to guide pneumonia
diagnosis, risk stratification, site of care, risk of antibiotic resistance, and treatment. ePNa smooths
transitions of care between clinicians. Our work incorporates the Five Rights of CDS to optimize the
technology’s strengths in the clinical environment. Two controlled studies demonstrate that ePNa
increases guideline-recommended, best practice care and decreases 30-day all-cause mortality in adults
with pneumonia. ePNa is ready to be deployed to additional environments with distinct patient
populations and EHRs. However, siloed EHRs limit technology developed within one vendor from being
shared with others. The objective of this proposal is to enable broad dissemination of ePNa by
optimizing its interoperability, scalability, and usability. Accordingly, we aim to (1) Develop a SMART on
FHIR ePNa application capable of interfacing with both the Cerner and Epic EMRs and conduct a
formative evaluation through an iterative design process. We will rapidly refine and validate the new
ePNa application. (2) Engage patients and clinicians to inform the patient-centeredness of ePNa’s clinical
interface. The project will incorporate feedback from stakeholder clinicians, administrators, and patients
to understand contextual factors affecting implementation success in a novel geographic and
demographic environment. (3) Evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of ePNa through a pilot
implementation trial guided by the RE-AIM QuEST framework.
Our proposal is likely to facilitate guideline adherent care for patients with pneumonia broadly across
different healthcare systems."
10911124,"Gastric cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-associated death worldwide. The global cancer statistics
report indicated an estimated 1,033,701 new gastric cancer cases and 782,685 deaths occurred in 2018.
Several studies have reported frequent association of gastric adenocarcinoma with Helicobacter pylori (H.
pylori) infection. The World Health Organization has classified H. pylori as a class I carcinogen and the main
risk factor for gastric cancer. Despite efforts to eradicate H. pylori, infection remains a global health problem
with almost half of the world’s population infected. According to a recent study of U.S soldiers deployed to the
Middle East and Far East, the incidence of H. pylori infection was 7.3 percent per year compared to 2.5
percent of U.S. military recruits living at home. This increase represents a major increase in risk. When
epithelial cells lose their protective capacity, they become prone to the carcinogenic effects of H. pylori, leading
to the development of intestinal metaplasia, gastric dysplasia and progression to cancer. Our recent
preliminary data in this proposal, demonstrates frequent overexpression of oncogenic FGFR4 signaling in
gastric cancer. Using in vitro and in vivo models as well as H. pylori infection, we demonstrated a novel link
between pro-inflammatory signaling (STAT3) and overexpression and activation of FGFR4. Functionally, we
found that FGFR4 plays a critical role in regulating the level and activity of NRF2, a major anti-oxidant
transcription factor, in response to cellular stress induced by H. pylori or chemotherapy. The FGFR4-NRF2
signaling promoted cell survival and resistance to chemotherapeutics. Based on our novel findings, we
hypothesize that the dynamic pro-inflammatory oncogenic cross-talk between STAT3, FGFR4 and cellular anti-
oxidant capacity plays a critical role in gastric tumorigenesis. Our goal is to understand the molecular and
functional consequences of FGFR4 in the multi-step gastric carcinogenesis cascade. In this proposal, we will
investigate mechanisms of activation of FGFR4 in gastric tumorigenesis (Aim 1). We will determine the
downstream molecular and biological functions of activation of FGFR4 and antioxidant response in gastric
tumorigenesis in Aim 2. The translational significance of activation FGFR4 and NRF2 across stages of human
gastric tumorigenesis will be investigated (Aim 3). In addition, Aim 3 will also determine the therapeutic
significance of inhibiting FGFR4 as a single agent or in combinations with standards of care in pre-clinical
models of gastric tumorigenesis. This proposal tackles etiology-based biologically-relevant questions to
uncover novel information regarding the role of H. pylori, inflammation, oxidative stress, and tumorigenic
signaling in the multi-step gastric tumorigenesis. A successful completion of this project will have a positive
impact on understanding the biology and identification of diagnostic, prognostic and possibly therapeutic
targets in gastric cancer."

10806230,"Sepsis, the injurious systemic response to infection, is a major cause of death in both industrialized and
developing societies. With advances in supportive care, sepsis mortality has improved, leading to increased
recognition of the chronic consequences of this critical illness. Nearly 50% of sepsis survivors experience long-
term cognitive impairment, akin to accelerated dementia. Despite the substantial societal burden of septic
cognitive impairment, no effective therapies are known to prevent or treat this condition.
A multidisciplinary collaboration between the laboratories of Drs. Eric Schmidt (an expert in sepsis and vascular
glycobiology) and Paco Herson (an expert in brain injury) recently identified a novel mechanism underlying the
development of septic cognitive impairment. As detailed in manuscripts published in 2019 in the Journal of
Clinical Investigation and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, we observed that heparan
sulfate (HS) fragments, shed into the circulation during septic degradation of the endothelial glycocalyx,
specifically penetrate into only one tissue: the hippocampus, a compartment of the brain responsible for spatial
memory formation. Hippocampal-penetrating HS fragments sequester a key growth factor necessary for
learning, leading to persistent cognitive impairment in both septic animals and humans.
The striking hippocampal specificity of HS extravasation during sepsis prompted our laboratory to pursue
additional preliminary experiments using a murine lipopolysaccharide (LPS) model of sepsis. LPS-induced
hippocampal blood-brain barrier (BBB) hyperpermeability was specific to HS, as similarly-sized dextrans were
unable to penetrate the hippocampus. Heparin affinity chromatography and proteomic analyses identified that
LPS selectively induces several HS-binding proteins within the hippocampus, including an endothelial protein
previously implicated in paracellular BBB permeability (Prion related protein, Prp). This selective induction of
hippocampal HS-binding proteins mirrors the hippocampal specificity of HS extravasation during sepsis.
Based upon these preliminary data, we hypothesize that sepsis induces expression of HS-binding proteins
(such as Prp) released into the blood stream. These proteins facilitate the selective transport of
circulating HS into the hippocampus, leading to cognitive impairment in sepsis survivors. Pursuit of this
hypothesis will require mechanistic interrogation of sepsis-induced HS-binding proteins as putative mediators of
HS uptake by the hippocampal BBB. To achieve this goal requires a multi-disciplinary team to use cutting-edge
molecular tools to assess HS transport in animal models and clinical studies to correlate to the human patient
population. We will specifically identify 1) the mechanism of HS accumulation into the hippocampus, 2) the role
of circulating prion-related protein in neurocognitive dysfunction following experimental sepsis and 3) correlate
circulating HS and Prp with cognitive outcome in human sepsis patients"
10868771,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Introduction: Skeletal Tissue Engineering Laboratories (STEL) Technologies, LLC is a woman-owned, Michigan-
based regenerative medicine company founded in 2013. STEL’s first product, the CGEMTM graft, is a unique
biological replacement for the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries. The researchers have since adapted this
graft technology with the goal of treating Rotator Cuff (RC) injuries increasingly prevalent in the aging population.
Significance: RC tears are a major orthopedic challenge in the US with over 460,000 surgeries performed
annually resulting in a market cost of over $523M[1,46]. The failure rate of current RC repair procedures ranges
from 20-95%, with a major contributing factor being the inability to restore native biomechanical properties at the
enthesis, resulting in repairs characterized by a weaker, less organized fibrovascular scar tissue that is prone to
failure[54]. Various tissue-engineering strategies are being developed to improve surgical outcomes and promote
tendon healing, especially at the enthesis. Current approaches focus on the development of biological or
synthetic scaffold devices to reinforce the mechanical strength of the tendon-to-bone connection, but they do not
promote enthesis regeneration. There is significant demand for alternative technologies for RC repair.
Vision for Commercial Product: The ETG-RC is devitalized allogeneic engineered multi-phasic tissue that
regenerates the enthesis and provide an underlayment that allows the migration of endogenous cells, enhancing
the regenerative capacity of the repair site. ETG-RC will lead to enhanced restoration of normal biomechanics
and mobility, resulting in lower cost and decreased risk of re-injury and arthritis. An “off-the-shelf” tissue graft for
RC repair will enhance the standard of care double row suture technique and deliver superior patient outcomes.
Goals of Proposed Research: The goals of this SBIR Project are to establish the feasibility of fabricating a fully
biologic “off-the-shelf” tissue-engineered rotator cuff tendon graft that can restore biomechanical properties of
the tendon-humerus enthesis; and to de-risk the commercial viability of ETG-RC in order to advance the
translatability of this technology for use in human patients.
Specific Aims: The proposed project addresses the several pressing issues that must be resolved prior to
bringing this technology to the FDA for clinical trials: development of a fabrication and decellularization protocol
(Aim 1) and establishment of storage methods to determine shelf life (Aim 2). It then seeks to establish a master
cell bank for fabrication of grafts for the Phase 1-3 clinical trials (Aim 3). CGMP quality ETG-RC grafts fabricated
from the established master cell bank will be tested for safety and efficacy by NAMSA (Aim 4). Positive data
from these studies will support filing of an IND-packet with FDA, enabling a Phase I clinical trial. Success of the
SBIR project will result in the development of an “off-the-shelf” tendon graft ready for first-in-human Phase I
clinical trials. This represents a significant commercialization milestone and a transformative innovation for the
treatment of soft tissue orthopedic injuries."

 We propose to develop a blood-based test whose indicated use is to complement mammography in the early
detection of breast cancers. Although mammography saves lives through early detection, it is imperfect.
Approximately one in seven breast cancers goes undetected despite screening mammography, and interval
cancers that manifest within a year of a normal mammogram remain a vexing problem, especially (although not
exclusively) for the >27 million women in the United States with heterogeneously or extremely dense breasts at
high risk for interval cancers. We propose to develop a blood test that could be used as an adjunct to
mammography to improve early detection by improving sensitivity and/or specificity of mammography.
 Using a novel biomarker discovery approach leveraging human-in-mouse breast cancer patient-derived
xenograft models and state-of-the-art mass spectrometry methods, we prioritized a subset of 162 candidate
breast cancer protein biomarkers (verified in human plasma from breast cancer cases vs. controls) for follow up
EDRN phase 2 validation studies in this proposed BCC.
 Our project will clinically validate and deploy (in our CLIA laboratories) a novel multiplex immuno-multiple
reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (immuno-MRM-MS) assay to perform EDRN phase 2 biomarker
validation studies using strongly unbiased sets of plasma samples obtained from existing biorepositories.
 The Administrative Core will support all aspects of the BCC, including managing all administrative and project
management aspects of the BCC (e.g., budgets, contracts, timelines, IRB documentation, site visits, travel
arrangements, progress reports, manuscript submission), as well as managing all center logistics and
communication (e.g., coordination of all communications within the BCC, between the BCC and NCI, and
between our BCC and others in the Network)."
10886725,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Parkinson’s disease dementia (PDD) is a frequent non-motor symptom in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD).
PDD is associated with cognitive decline that can increase morbidity and mortality and dramatically reduce
patient quality of life. Three out of four PD patients will develop PDD, yet the only FDA-approved treatment for
PDD is rivastigmine which provides effects that are short-lived and modest at best and may worsen PD motor
symptoms. Furthermore, gold standard therapies for Parkinsonian motor impairments (i.e., levodopa and deep
brain stimulation) can worsen PDD, yet stopping treatment is typically not recommended. To address this dire
need, Scion NeuroStim, Inc has developed a novel, home-use device that non-invasively stimulates nuclei in the
brainstem that send projections throughout the brain to regulate a variety of functions including cognition,
memory, well-being, and mood. In a previous double-blind, randomized controlled trial, eight weeks of Device
treatments dramatically improved both motor and non-motor symptoms in PD patients. Device treatments were
well tolerated and safe with only infrequent, transient, and mild side effects. Importantly, a sub-analysis of data
from participants with evidence of either mild cognitive impairment or dementia revealed that Device treatment
was associated with significantly improved cognitive performance according to the Montreal Cognitive
Assessment. Treatment adherence was excellent and study participants remained blind to their treatment
allocation. Furthermore, the kinetics of the clinical responses indicate that longer treatment periods are likely to
result in even greater clinical improvements. Thus, in this project, Scion will conduct a single-arm clinical trial to
evaluate the safety and feasibility of non-invasive brainstem stimulation with Scion’s Device over a period of 12
weeks in PDD patients. Further, it will explore the potential for Scion’s Device to treat cognitive and other motor
and non-motor symptoms associated with PDD, which, if favorable, will enable the design and powering of a
pivotal trial."
10874438,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and its less severe form, acute lung injury (ALI), are devastating,
life-threatening respiratory illnesses that can result from pneumonia. Injury to the alveolar epithelial-endothelial
barrier in ARDS results in alveolar edema that mechanically impairs alveolar distensibility, hinders gas
exchange, and promotes inflammation. Disruption of normal lung mechanics and biology demonstrate the need
to study ARDS at the intersection of lung immunobiology and physical sciences. The importance of lung
mechanobiology is reflected by current effective therapeutic interventions that target lung mechanics, such as
protective mechanical ventilation and prone positioning. While ARDS edema is known to compromise alveolar
mechanics, the downstream consequences on capillary mechanics, hemodynamics, and oxygen transport are
not well known. As a result, it remains unknown how altered capillary function in ARDS affects the trafficking,
sequestration, migration, and phagocytosis of key immune cell types, such as resident and recruited
macrophages. Our understanding of ARDS microphysiology is limited by a technological gap to study lung
respiratory-circulatory function at the cellular scale in real-time. Current imaging modalities such as MRI/CT
and histological analyses lack the necessary spatial and temporal resolution to probe dynamic events such as
vascular flow, cellular trafficking and migration, and gas exchange. To address these needs, we have
developed a novel “LungEx” system that allows mechanistic probing of lung respiratory-circulatory function in
real-time at the single capillary scale. LungEx is an ex vivo ventilated and perfused murine lung with preserved
physics and biology near that of in vivo lungs, combined with a transparent “crystal” ribcage to allow high-
resolution optical microscopy of capillary function in real-time. Combining LungEx with experimental murine
models of ALI caused by pneumonia (PNA-ALI), we have preliminarily observed altered capillary function in
edematous PNA-ALI regions. Here, utilizing LungEx, we will test the hypotheses that: altered alveolar
mechanics in PNA-ALI impairs capillary mechanics, restricts RBC flow trafficking, and hence reduces oxygen
transport on the capillary scale (Aim 1); and altered mechanics in PNA-ALI differentially impedes resident vs
recruited macrophage function, promoting a mechanosensitive inflammatory profile (Aim 2). These studies will
improve our understanding of the mechanobiology and mechanoimmunity underlying pneumonia-associated
ARDS pathogenesis that begins on the single capillary level and how it affects key immunovascular
components of the lung. As part of the pre-doctoral fellowship training towards a physician-scientist career, the
proposed work will emphasize hypothesis-based experimental design, scientific communication and
mentorship, integration of research with clinical practice, and will be carried out at Boston University."

Title: Towards Precision Immuno-Oncology: Unraveling the Genomic Determinants and Mechanisms
Underlying Immunotherapy Efficacy and Resistance
 Immunotherapy has shown considerable promise for improving outcomes for cancer patients.
Treatment of patients with antibodies against CTLA4, PD-1, or PD-L1 can result in dramatic responses and
durable tumor control in some patients. However, most patients do not benefit and ICB treatment can cause
severe side effects. Therefore, it is of paramount importance in the field to understand the mechanisms
underlying sensitivity and resistance to ICB and other immunotherapies. The long-term goal of our research
program is to unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying sensitivity and resistance to immunotherapies
such as ICB and to work towards a better understanding of how to use immunotherapy in a precise and
individualized manner. We propose to investigate how tumor and patient genetics/genomics affect tumor
immune phenotypes and influence the response and resistance to immunotherapies. Over the next 7 years,
our efforts will be focused on addressing three important questions with clear mechanistic and translational
relevance. First, we will undertake a comprehensive analysis of how the diversity of mutational landscapes
and densities, and DNA damage repair (DDR) deficiencies affect immunotherapy response in cancers treated
with ICB (anti-PD1 or anti-CTLA4). This is aimed at developing and credentialing a precise model for ICB
sensitivity and resistance to allow the design of rationale therapeutic combinations and personalization of ICB
treatment. Second, we will use pre-clinical models and patient samples to evaluate how driver mutations in
critical DDR mutations influence tumor immunity, ICB response, and acquired resistance. Third, we will
characterize how the patient germline genotype (HLA), together with somatic mutation profiles of tumors,
influence response to ICB."
10839311,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Aphasia is a common and debilitating communication disorder caused by damage to the language regions
of the brain, most often from stroke. Impairments in the production of naturalistic language (also referred to as
discourse or connected speech) are ubiquitous in aphasia and cause significant health-related disability. Given
how integral naturalistic language production is to all human interaction, advancing our understanding of
impaired naturalistic language production in aphasia is of high priority for all key stakeholders: individuals with
aphasia, clinicians, and researchers.
 Despite its importance, our understanding of naturalistic language production in aphasia is limited.
Specifically, two key questions remain unanswered: (1) How do salient features (e.g., abandoned utterances,
grammatical omissions, phonemic paraphasias) of impaired naturalistic language production map onto neural
characteristics, such as lesion location or extent? (2) How do features change over time? Although emerging
evidence has yielded promising insights, challenges related to both the measures used and the individuals
studied are barriers to advancing our knowledge on these topics. The goal of the proposed project is to
address the limitations in the current literature by leveraging a novel measure of naturalistic language
production in aphasia and applying it to a large and ongoing longitudinal study (R01 DC013270) using
advanced analytic techniques. Specifically, we will score naturalistic language samples from ~225 individuals
with aphasia across four time points over the first year of stroke recovery using a psychometrically robust
measure I developed called the Auditory-Perceptual Rating of Connected Speech in Aphasia (APROCSA).
Scores on three core dimensions of impaired naturalistic language production will serve as outcome measures.
 In Aim 1, we will characterize the neural correlates of naturalistic language production in acute aphasia by
building a series of complementary multiple linear and support vector regression models to evaluate relations
between naturalistic language impairment and structural brain damage, where lesion-delineated brain scans
will be used to predict performance on the three APROCSA dimensions.
 In Aim 2, we will quantify patterns and predictors of naturalistic language production recovery in aphasia by
measuring (1) the trajectory of behavioral change on the three APROCSA dimensions and (2) the influence of
lesion location and extent on change, using a powerful approach called latent growth curve modeling.
 The impact of the proposed project will be an explanatory brain-behavior model of naturalistic language
production in aphasia that improves clinicians’ ability to develop prognoses, provide informed education, and
benchmark performance on an everyday language skill. This proposal will also provide essential mentorship for
developing a translational research program that applies tools from cognitive neuroscience and quantitative
methods to the study of naturalistic language production and other clinically relevant areas in aphasia."

FDA-approved therapies. The Diabetic Foot Consortium (DFC) was established in 2018 as the first multi-site
US clinical research effort to elucidate biomarkers that promote DFU healing and prevent recurrence. The
multiplicity and complexity of known factors contributing to poor outcomes require the diversity of experience
and expertise of the four DFC clinical research units (CRUs), the biomarker analysis units (BAUs), and the
University of Michigan (UM) data coordinating center (DCC) to achieve the scientific objectives of the DFC.
 The DCC brings over 23 years of experience in statistical and operational leadership of complex
studies and networks, leveraging specific experience in diabetes complications and co-morbidity modeling,
design and analysis of chronic diseases, biomarker discovery and validation, and FDA collaborations. The
DCC’s leadership in these areas complements the clinical and laboratory expertise of the DFC. Together we
will identify important and reliable biomarkers that predict DFU healing and recurrence and study the
association of patient and physician characteristics with good DFU outcomes. In our first 3 years, the DCC has
built successful and durable partnerships with CRU and BAU investigators and NIDDK scientists to implement
two biomarker validation studies and a biorepository study that collects biospecimens for future research. We
will continue this partnership to complete these complex studies and finalize a platform study in patients with
open DFUs that will support future biomarker studies, as well further our knowledge of the impact of standard
of care therapies and social determinants of health on DFU outcomes. These activities will lay the foundation
for future trials leading to better care and health outcomes for patients with DFUs.
 We will accomplish these goals by: 1) providing tailored infrastructure and services to ensure seamless
administration and operations for all DFC studies and facilitate effective communication among DFC
stakeholders; 2) ensuring the collection of timely, accurate and reproducible data and high-quality
biospecimens and maximizing adherence to study protocols by providing expert statistical design, efficient
database architecture, and effective study coordination; 3) applying state-of-the-art bioinformatics and
statistical methods to analyze biomarker qualification, to detect important patient characteristics associated
with good clinical outcomes, and to identify testable hypotheses to guide care for subpopulations of patients
with DFUs. Completion of these aims by a highly experienced and accomplished UM DCC will result in
translation of the validated biomarkers from bench to bedside, and improvements in standard of care based on
comprehensive patient, foot ulcer and treatment data. Collaboration among the CRUs, BAUs, satellite sites,
ancillary study investigators, NIDDK and DCC will maximize the scientific and clinical impact of the Consortium

Invasive infections due to Aspergillus fumigatus are increasing and are still associated with unacceptably high
mortality, even with new therapies. Our understanding of A. fumigatus infection biology is limited. Among 10,180
predicted genes in the A. fumigatus genome, over 95% are uncharacterized, and fewer than 100 genes have
demonstrated roles in virulence. It is critical to identify genes that govern virulence and the pathways in which
they act because they can point to high priority targets for therapeutic and diagnostic development. We have
identified a transcriptional regulator in A. fumigatus, WrpA, that shares limited homology with Candida albicans
Wor1 and Histoplasma capsulatum Ryp1. Our preliminary data indicate that WrpA governs the capacity of A.
fumigatus to withstand macrophage killing, grow under hypoxic conditions, and invade and damage pulmonary
cells in vitro. ΔwrpA deletion mutants have highly attenuated virulence in the mouse model of invasive
aspergillosis. Using RNA-seq, we found that WrpA governs the expression of ~15% of genes in the A. fumigatus
genome, including multiple transcription factor genes. Our premise is that the WrpA is a master regulator that
governs host cell interactions and virulence. In support of this premise, our initial investigations of the WrpA
regulon have already revealed novel pathogenicity-related functions of three WrpA-dependent transcription
factors, SrbB, Fcr1, and Ndt80. Our goal is to characterize the WrpA regulon in A. fumigatus and to identify
downstream effector genes whose products mediate pathogenicity by: 1) identifying the transcription factors that
are directly regulated by WrpA and determining their roles in pathogenicity; 2) analyzing selected WrpA-
dependent transcription factors and identifying their downstream target genes; and 3) determining the function
of effector genes controlled by the WrpA regulon and investigating their roles in virulence. The results of the
experiments described in this proposal will enable us to characterize a key transcriptional regulator that governs
A. fumigatus pathogenicity and then use this information to identify downstream effector genes, the products of
which mediate host cell interactions and virulence. The results of this work will not only provide foundational
understanding of A. fumigatus virulence mechanisms, but also hold promise to identify new diagnostic,
therapeutic, and vaccine targets."

Sepsis is a life-threatening disease caused by dysregulated host responses to infection. Sepsis
remains a major health problem worldwide with high mortality. Myeloid cell responses such as
endotoxin tolerance, epigenetic modification, metabolic failure, and apoptosis are profoundly
affected in sepsis, which leads to systemic dysfunction of immune cells and progenitor cells. The
regulation of myeloid cell responses in sepsis remains largely unknown. The histone deacetylase
HDAC6 regulates a variety of cellular responses. However, HDAC6 regulation of myeloid cell
responses in sepsis has not been investigated. Our preliminary studies indicate that HDAC6 is a
key mediator of cell signaling in myeloid cells. Myeloid-specific HDAC6 deletion reduces the
mortality in septic mice. Furthermore, selective HDAC6 inhibition can modulate myeloid cell
responses in the mouse models of sepsis. In the proposed studies, we will test the hypothesis
that HDAC6 activation mediates myeloid cell dysfunction in sepsis, and HDAC6 inhibition could
improve myeloid cell function and survival rate in sepsis."

New therapies are urgently needed for patients with malignant gliomas, which are highly invasive and lethal brain
tumors. Patients with glioblastoma (GBM) die within 1-2 years of diagnosis despite current conventional
therapies, including surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. A major driver of tumor recurrence is the infiltrative
nature of the glioma cells into adjacent normal brain, which is driven by activation of a mesenchymal transcription
program. This mesenchymal transition is activated through extracellular stimulation of cell surface receptors by
growth factors such as TGFβ1. The overall purpose of the present project is to investigate the role of adhesion
G protein-coupled receptor B1 (ADGRB1/BAI1) in the mesenchymal switch and invasion, and explore new
therapies for GBM based on the related mechanisms. ADGRB1 is an orphan adhesion GPCR specifically
expressed in the brain. We previously showed that ADGRB1 expression is significantly reduced in patients with
GBM through epigenetic silencing, suggesting that ADGRB1 loss may facilitate tumor formation. Our new
preliminary data show that low ADGRB1 expression correlates with invasion and poor outcome in glioma
patients. Restoration of ADGRB1 expression in GBM cells suppresses the mesenchymal phenotype in culture
and mice xenografts. Our pilot studies further suggest ADGRB1 can inhibit TGFβ1-driven mesenchymal
transition through a WxLWxLW motif in its first thrombospondin type 1 repeat (TSR1). This motif mediates
ADGRB1 binding to the latent TGFβ1 complex and prevents TGFβ1 maturation. Based on these results, we
hypothesize that ADGRB1 acts as a brain tumor suppressor by blocking the TGFβ1-mediated mesenchymal
switch and that restoration of its expression with epigenetic therapy will represent a novel therapeutic intervention
for GBM. To test our hypothesis, we propose the following aims: (i) define how ADGRB1 negatively regulates
the mesenchymal transition and glioma invasion, (ii), determine how BAI1 antagonizes TGFβ1 pro-mesenchymal
signaling and (iii) evaluate whether epigenetic restoration of BAI1 expression can inhibit glioma cell invasion in
vitro and in vivo, and augment survival post-operation. These studies are important as we identified a specific
region in the extracellular domain of BAI1 that antagonizes TGFβ1 maturation and the glioma mesenchymal
switch, providing a new mechanism for antagonizing this oncogenic pathway that can be exploited
therapeutically. These findings support targeting this new pathway in patients whose cancers are driven by
mesenchymal transition."
10842246,"Project Summary/Abstract
Humans have approximately 40 trillion cells and ~ 0.1% of them divide every day for tissue maintenance, wound
repair, and pathogen defense. Such cells include stem, progenitor and differentiated cells that typically spend
most of their time in a non-proliferative state (quiescence, G0) but when stimulated can undergo one or more
rounds of cell division (proliferation). This fundamental decision between quiescence and proliferation is made
in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Importantly, along with making the decision to proliferate, cells must load
sufficient origins of replication (origin licensing) during G1 to replicate their DNA without error during S phase.
How cells make the decision to enter quiescence is not fully understood. Critical questions of how E2F and
APC/CCdh1 activities are temporally integrated to coordinate the regulation between quiescence and proliferation
and the licensing of origins of replication also remain unanswered.
The Meyer lab specializes in the use of single-cell analysis of live-cell imaging data. By utilizing recently
developed fluorescent reporters for key cell cycle proteins, the lab can answer various biological questions with
very high resolution. This project will employ the use of fluorescent activity reporters for CDK1/2, APC/CCdh1,
CRL4Cdt2 and E2F to understand signaling dynamics of S phase entry, G0 entry and origin licensing in G1.
The goal of this proposal is to compare the dynamic synergy between E2F activity and APC/CCdh1 activity in
quiescent and cycling single cells and identify how cells maintain an origin licensing period. The objective of this
proposal is to show the existence of two S phase entry signaling pathways controlled by synergy between E2F
and APC/CCdh1 activity in single cells and how this synergy controls origin licensing and quiescence entry. My
central hypothesis is that the temporal interplay between E2F and APC/CCdh1 activities is the primary regulator
of the decision between proliferation and quiescence and, ensures proper origin licensing to prevent DNA
damage in S phase. I plan to test this hypothesis with the following specific aims:
1. Understand the interplay between E2F and APC/CCdh1 activities in regulating the proliferation-quiescence
decision.
2. Determine the function of E2F and APC/CCdh1 activity timing in origin licensing and DNA replication fidelity.
The successful completion of this project is expected to show the multifaceted roles of APC/CCdh1 and E2F
synergy. This project will resolve a historic enigma of how cells faithfully coordinate licensing and DNA replication
by utilizing the remarkable natural heterogeneity that exists in cell populations. Further, the completion of this
project will provide crucial insights into how cancer cells may evade chemotherapies that target DNA replication
by entering a dormant quiescent state and how healthy cells are able to maintain quiescent populations for tissue
repair and growth."

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States. Atherosclerosis, a major cause
of CVD, is an inflammatory disease resulting from the build-up of cholesterol in plaque along the artery walls.
These plaques are formed by accumulation of macrophage foam cells as an inflammatory response to oxidized
low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) in damaged endothelial cells. Free fatty acid receptor 4 (FFAR4), also known as
G-protein coupled receptor 120 (GPR120), is a long-chain unsaturated fatty acid receptor expressed in
adipocytes, endothelial cells, and macrophages. Activation of FFAR4 helps maintain metabolic homeostasis by
regulating adipogenesis, insulin sensitivity, and inflammation. While FFAR4 is best known for its protective role
in preventing obesity and diabetes, recent studies have demonstrated that FFAR4 may also play an important
role in the prevention of atherosclerosis and CVD. Given FFAR4’s importance in anti-inflammatory signaling and
high expression levels in macrophages, we designed experiments to test the hypothesis that FFAR4 plays a
cardioprotective role by preventing pathways that lead to atherosclerosis. These experiments will require
macrophages harvested from wild-type and FFAR4-knockout mice, and in some cases, macrophages treated
with FFAR4 agonists. In Aim 1, we will investigate the effects of FFAR4 deficiency on macrophage foam cell
formation. Specifically, we will determine whether FFAR4 deficiency increases oxLDL uptake (Aim 1.1),
decreases cholesterol efflux (Aim 1.2), and decreases macrophage migration (Aim 1.3). In Aim 2, we will
investigate the signaling mechanisms utilized by FFAR4 to protects against foam cell formation and test the
hypothesis that canonical Gaq/11 FFAR4 signaling reduces cholesterol uptake and promotes cholesterol efflux by
inhibiting the transcription factor PPARg. In Aim 3, we will investigate the physiological role of FFAR4 in
atherosclerosis. Aim 3.1 will examine how FFAR4 deficiency in vivo impacts lipid levels and circulating
inflammatory cytokines. Aim 3.2 will assess atherosclerotic lesion size differences and immune cell activation
status in the aorta of LDLR-/- mice following transplantation of bone marrow from FFAR4+/+ or FFAR4-/- mice. The
outcomes of these proposed studies will uncover the biological functions of FFAR4 and mechanisms that
underlie how FFAR4 protects against macrophage foam cell formation, a hallmark of atherosclerosis. Ultimately,
our combined current and future studies may identify FFAR4 as a novel therapeutic target for atherosclerosis."
10845369,"Abstract
The computations performed by circuits in the visual system are numerous and varied, emerging from many
cell types with unique combinations of synaptic inputs, molecular composition, and physiological properties.
How are distinct computations distributed across neurons and circuits in the visual system, and how are
anatomical and molecular features differentially engaged to support them? Addressing these fundamental
questions requires a model with deep, cell-by-cell descriptions of gene expression and morphology. This
project will examine computation by assessing the varied representation of visual features across cell types in
the Drosophila medulla, the first site of major synaptic divergence and signal expansion in the fly visual
pathway. By extending established genetic tools, this study will record visual selectivity in most of the ~70
medulla cell types in a fraction of the time required for traditional approaches. This broad physiological
assessment will then be leveraged to explore how differences in wiring and gene expression relate to different
visual computations. First, a linear/non-linear sum-of-inputs model, weighted according to data from the fly
connectome, will describe the extent to which a neuron’s activity can be explained by its feedforward input.
Second, a large-scale regression of response features with cell type-specific transcriptome data will reveal how
genetic suites and individual molecules contribute to visual feature selectivity. And finally, manipulations of
modulatory circuit elements will uncover how feedback and laterally connected cell types contribute to visual
computation. Collectively, these experiments will describe how different forms of synaptic input and distinct
genetic programs are differentially recruited to build the computations necessary for proper visual processing.
The results of this study have the potential to qualitatively improve critical technologies related to the quality of
human life, including retinal prosthetics and machine vision."

 Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States
with mortality continuing to rise despite advances in medicine. Cachexia, a form of muscle wasting, is a
debilitating co-morbidity whose prevalence increases with severity of COPD. But, cachexia still occurs among
COPD patients with milder disease severity. Cachexia is most often thought of with respect to cancer. However,
by population prevalence there are more COPD patients with cachexia than cancer patients with cachexia. Yet
there have been few studies investigating the etiology of COPD cachexia underscoring the need for
investigations of COPD cachexia and weight-loss. Accumulating data including our own points to a role for iron
toxicity in the etiology of COPD cachexia. Heme is an essential component of mitochondrial cytochromes
providing protection from reactive oxygen species (ROS). Defects in heme biosynthesis cause buildup of free
iron, ROS and mitochondrial dysfunction. Buildup of free iron leads to iron toxicity and production of ROS
particularly in the absence of adequate intake of antioxidants such as Vitamins E. As such, our overarching
hypothesis is iron toxicity in COPD cachexia is driven by impaired antioxidant and mitochondrial function. This
study has three specific aims: 1) To determine whether genomic variation associated with the absorption and
regulation of Vitamin E is more common in COPD cachexia; 2) To assess whether plasma Vitamin E in subjects
with COPD cachexia are associated with impaired mitochondrial function; Exploratory Aim) To test whether
iron induced transcriptional dysregulation signatures in myoblasts are preserved in transcriptomics signatures
associated with COPD cachexia in skeletal muscle biopsies. Elucidating mechanisms of mitochondrial
dysfunction in COPD cachexia has the potential to aid the development of therapeutics targeting mitochondrial
oxidative stress. As future research, we plan to test whether ‘omic regions and metabolites identified as
associated with COPD cachexia directly effect pathways involved with Vitamin E and mitochondrial function
using targeted assays in myoblasts or other appropriate systems."
10845535,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Large-scale studies have identified thousands of genetic variants linked to developmental defects,
together with the regulatory elements harboring these variants and the cell types in which these variants likely
function. This diversity of variants, regulatory elements, and cell types indicates that multiple mechanisms
contribute to developmental defects. One key challenge to our understanding of these mechanisms is that the
molecular, cellular, and functional phenotypes of each variant remain largely uncharacterized. Until these critical
gaps in knowledge are addressed, the underlying molecular and cellular determinants of developmental disease
susceptibility will remain incomplete. To bridge these gaps, we propose to establish the “UT Southwestern
Center for Regulatory Element Variation and Function”. The primary goal of this Center is to systematically
catalog molecular and cellular phenotypes for disease-associated enhancers in human development, with a
focus on gaining insights into mechanisms of non-canonical human genetics and gene regulation.
 To build a generalizable framework to understanding the impact of human genetic variation on function,
we propose a high throughput perturbation platform with three primary goals: (1) Contribute to a
variant/element/phenotype catalog with relevance to diseases of human development, focusing on elements
genetically associated with congenital heart disease (cardiomyocytes), autism (neurons), and placental defects
(trophoblasts); (2) Contribute to a variant/element/phenotype catalog for non-canonical human genetics,
focusing on two understudied topics in human genetics: pleiotropic effects and non-cell autonomous effects; and
(3) Contribute to a variant/element/phenotype catalog with relevance to mechanisms of gene regulation, focusing
on enhancer RNAs. The Center will take advantage of recent technological innovations in genome engineering,
single-cell genomics, and high content screening to enable the multiscale functional characterization of genomic
variation in human developmental disorders. Several of these techniques have been pioneered by investigators
contributing to this project, including: the development of novel tools for enhancer perturbation and the coupling
of endogenous enhancer perturbations with a single-cell RNA-Seq readout (Mosaic-Seq).
 Impact and Significance: The efforts on this project will lead to a number of key outcomes and
deliverables, including (1) greater understanding of the relationships between sequence variation and genome
function, (2) an extensive variant/element/phenotype catalog for the community, (3) tools for generating
predictive models for the community, and (4) resources to enable future functional genomics studies. Together,
our multifaceted and combinatorial approaches will open new horizons to understanding the impact of regulatory
variants on developmental disease phenotypes."

Cancer is a leading cause of death and disease. The recent success of immune checkpoint therapy (ICT) has
revolutionized tumor therapy, indicating that manipulation of the immune system is an effective strategy to treat
cancer. MAbs inhibiting CTLA-4 and PD-1 have been extensively shown to unleash T cell effector functions to
control tumors in both mice and some cancer patients. However, ICT is incompletely effective for certain tumors,
which escape using multiple mechanisms, one of which is the generation of a tumor microenvironment rich in
immunosuppressive myeloid cells. TREM2 is an immune receptor expressed by tissue macrophages that binds
phospholipids and lipoproteins and transmits intracellular signals through the ITAM pathway. Recently,
TREM2+ macrophages have been reported in many human tumors. In our preliminary data, we demonstrate that
TREM2-deficiency or mouse TREM2 blockade with the mAb 178 curbs subcutaneous tumor growth of the 3-
methylcholanthrene (MCA) cell line and leads to complete tumor regression when associated with suboptimal
PD-1 immunotherapy. Furthermore, high-resolution analysis of the tumor cell infiltrate in the MCA model reveals
complex remodeling of the myeloid cell landscape in Trem2–/– and anti-TREM2 treated mice. The overall goal of
this application is to advance our understanding of the therapeutic impact of TREM2 blockade in mouse models
and human cancer. In Aim 1 we show that TREM2 targeting enhances ICT mediated by anti-PD1; we propose
to determine whether TREM2 deficiency or blockade impact other tumor therapies, such as anti-CTLA4 and
chemotherapy, which elicit different types of immune responses. The impact of TREM2 will be assessed using
injected MCA cell lines and the spontaneous MMTV-PyMT model of breast cancer. In Aim 2 we will define the
mechanisms through which anti-TREM2 impacts the tumor microenvironment. Given that a) immunosuppressive
macrophages depend on lipid metabolism and accumulate lipid droplets; b) TREM2 promotes foam cell formation
by binding lipoproteins; and c) anti-TREM2 mAb blocks lipid binding to TREM2, we will test the hypothesis that
TREM2 blockade converts tumor macrophages from immunosuppressive to immunostimulatory by blocking lipid
droplet accumulation and foam cell formation. We will also test an alternative mechanism based on the
observation that TREM2 is cleaved from the cell surface by ADAM metalloproteases, generating soluble TREM2
(sTREM2), which promotes survival of macrophages in various disease models. We will test the hypothesis that
lack of sTREM2 in a transgenic mouse with uncleavable TREM2 prevents survival of immunosuppressive tumor
macrophages. In Aim 3, we show unpublished data indicating that anti-human TREM2 mAb 21E10 delays tumor
growth of an injected MCA cell line in mice expressing human TREM2 in place of mouse TREM2. Therefore, we
will determine whether TREM2 blockade with a specific mAb can be extended to a preclinical model expressing
the human TREM2 receptor. Overall, this proposal will advance our knowledge of a novel therapeutic approach
based on TREM2 that broadens our armamentarium for targeting immunosuppressive myeloid cells in tumors."

The Metabolism and Bioenergetics Core (MBC) is a critical research core in the Center for Childhood Obesity 
Prevention (CCOP). The MBC make cutting-edge biomedical research services available to CCOP 
investigators at Arkansas Children’s Research Institute (ACRI). Our specific expertise and focus are the 
application of stable isotope technologies and high resolution respirometry to the study of substrate 
metabolism and bioenergetics. The primary goal of the MBC is to support early stage CCOP investigators in 
research focused on the development, treatment, and prevention of obesity by providing access to 
instrumentation and expertise to execute studies focused on altered metabolism and bioenergetics. This 
encompasses study design, implementation, biological sample analyses, as well as data analyses and 
interpretation. The MBC will further mentor investigators in key methodological approaches used to quantify 
metabolism and bioenergetics. Our long-term goal is to transition the MBC into a sustainable core facility at 
ACRI with broad intra- and extra-institutional user base."
10898628,"Project Summary. Vestibular afferent responses deviate from the coherent mechanical stimulation imparted by
their overlying accessory structures. This implicates further processing by hair cells (HCs) and primary afferent
conductances, and by afferent and efferent synapses. Processing is complicated by the parallel modes of
transmission between HCs and afferents, and the convergence of multiple HCs onto single afferents. Type I HCs
are enveloped by an afferent calyx, creating a restricted volume in the cleft between them. Type II HCs synapse
onto the external face of a calyx and/or onto bouton endings via relatively small contact areas. This results in
three types of HC-to-afferent convergence. In the simplest form, HCs converge onto an afferent solely at bouton
endings. Increased complexity is found at calyces, including both simple calyces enveloping one HC and
complex calyces encompassing two or more HCs. The highest complexity occurs at dimorphic endings that
receive input from both HC types through a combination of bouton and both inner- and outer-face calyceal
synapses. Prior studies have shown that for calyceal endings, rapid excitatory quantal transmission via
glutamatergic AMPA receptors may be modulated by K+, H+, and Ca2+ accumulation. Dynamic changes in cleft
ion concentrations occur in response to HC or afferent depolarization. These in turn impact responses in both
the type I HCs and their afferents due to changes in the conductances and equilibrium potentials facing the cleft.
As a result, properties of inner-face calyceal contacts differ significantly from those of HC and afferent
conductances bathed in the bulk perilymph. For that reason, prior single-electrode biophysical experiments on
HCs or their afferents in situ, or on isolated cells, have been unable to distinguish the contributions of HCs and
afferents resulting from reciprocal interactions created by the unique volume of the synaptic cleft coupling the
two. In this project, biophysical and morphological experiments will be performed on HC and afferent synaptic
pairs in the posterior semicircular canal crista ampullaris of the red-eared turtle, T. scripta elegans, taking
advantage of our unique ability to record simultaneously from both a HC and the afferent it contacts. This
approach will be used to characterize the ionic environment of the synaptic cleft, the biophysical properties of
HC and afferent conductances under conditions where the membrane potentials of a HC and its associated
afferent are controlled simultaneously, and the structural elements responsible for these properties. The project
has two major aims: (1) to contrast the biophysics and morphology of synaptic inputs from type I HCs onto the
internal face of the calyx with those from type II HCs onto the calyceal external face and/or bouton endings of
nearby branches, and examine their modulation by accumulation of ions and potential transmitters; and (2) to
identify the mechanisms, modulators, sites of action and regional differences in nicotinic and muscarinic
cholinergic efferent input to type I and II HCs and calyx afferents across the crista. Overall, this project will provide
an integrated structural, functional biophysical characterization of peripheral vestibular signal processing."
10911168,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
With the rising prevalence of diabetes in the US and other countries, there is an ongoing research effort to find
biomarkers allowing the identification of patients with diabetes at high risk of end stage kidney disease
(ESKD). With support from NIH and JDRF, we have identified 21 serum proteins that were significantly
associated with increased risk of kidney function loss and ESKD in the Joslin Kidney Study, and have
developed an ad hoc OLINK multiplex assay (so called Joslin Kidney Panel [JKP]) to measure these
biomarkers. Preliminary data strongly suggest that a subset of the JKP can significantly improve the ability to
predict ESKD risk in subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2D) when added to GFR and allbuminuria. In this
proposal, we aim to validate these preliminary findings in other settings, in order to develop improved
algorithms for ESKD risk prediction. We intend to accomplish these goals using existing data and specimens
from individuals with and without T2D from 1. the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study; and 2. the
Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial and its follow-up study ACCORDION. Our
Specific Aims are: 1: To identify the most informative of the 21 biomarkers in the Joslin Kidney Panel
and evaluate their performance, when added to GFR and albuminuria, in predicting ESKD risk among
subjects with T2D and chronic kidney disease. We will measure the 21 proteins of the JKP in baseline
serum specimens from ~1,500 CRIC participants with T2D, and will use these data together with GFR and
albuminuria to develop and internally validate multi-marker prognostic algorithms predicting the risk of ESKD
(primary outcome) or the composite of ESKD and/or 50% loss of kidney function (secondary outcome) during
10 years of follow-up. 2: To evaluate the generalizability of findings from CRIC to T2D individuals with a
broader spectrum of kidney function. We will assay the JKP in baseline serum specimens from a case-
cohort sample of ~2,000 ACCORD/ACCORDION participants and will use these data to investigate the
generalizability of the predictive algorithms built in CRIC to diabetic patients with different characteristics. The
prognostic models developed in Aim 1 and externally validated in Aim 2 will be used to build a web-based
Kidney Risk Calculator for the estimation of the 10-year risk of ESKD in a clinical setting. 3: To evaluate the
transferability of the Kidney Risk Calculator from diabetic to non-diabetic kidney disease. We will
measure the 21 JKP biomarkers in baseline serum samples from ~1,700 non-diabetic subjects from the CRIC
study and will assess the performance of the Kidney Risk Calculator developed in Aim 2 in predicting the risk
of ESKD and ESKD/50% kidney function loss in patients with non-diabetic kidney disease. The proposed
research has a high likelihood of resulting in the development of improved prognostic tools for the stratification
of patients with diabetes according to their risk of progression to ESKD. This would be a great advancement for
optimizing patient care and for improving the efficiency of clinical trials of new ESKD-preventing interventions."
10894934,"This proposal responds to the provocative question PQ9: What methods can be developed to effectively
study small or rare populations relevant to cancer research? We will address this question by generating
organoid models of pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGL) to fill gaps in the mechanisms underlying
tumor behavior and in therapeutic opportunities. PPGLs are rare catecholamine-secreting, neural crest-derived
tumors originating from adrenal or extra adrenal paraganglia, respectively. Malignant PPGLs can only be
recognized after detection of metastases, implying a late diagnosis. Approximately 30-40% of paragangliomas,
and 10-15% of pheochromocytomas can develop metastases. In addition, PPGLs are clinically heterogeneous,
can be recurrent and invasive, even without metastasis, but predictors of clinical behavior are lacking. Treatment
options are currently limited, with modest effects on survival, and advances in this area are dampened by a
scarcity of research models. Therefore, there is a critical need for developing models to uncover biological
mechanisms that facilitate clinical outcome prediction and reveal molecular vulnerabilities which can be explored
for therapeutic purposes. Our preliminary data indicate that we can successfully generate PPGL organoids that
are amenable for drug screen. Our aims are: 1) to determine if PPGL organoids recapitulate features of the
parental tumor; 2) to leverage PPGL organoids to investigate outstanding biological questions, including the
existence of cell subtypes that may be related to tumor outcome, and 3) to utilize PPGL organoids for high-
throughput drug screening that uncover vulnerabilities for future therapeutic testing, including novel leads
suggested in our preliminary data. The proposed project will serve as a useful resource for designing future
studies to decode the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying PPGL development and clinical
heterogeneity. Results from these studies may provide the groundwork for future testing of candidate drugs that
might have immediate clinical application."
10916368,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer now have, on average, nearly 85% 5-year survival. However,
premature cardiovascular (CV) disease has become the leading non-cancer cause of late mortality among
childhood cancer survivors. There is a robust body of evidence from the general population, and increasingly,
among cancer survivors (even those exposed to cardiotoxic cancer therapies), that greater physical activity (PA)
and improved diet quality can reduce future CV-related morbidity. However, while many general population and
cancer-specific intervention studies have focused on a single lifestyle factor (e.g., PA or diet alone), given the
interplay between PA and dietary factors in influencing CV health, a multi-faceted approach may result in overall
better long-term CV health profiles. Research on lifestyle interventions in cancer survivors also has been
predominantly conducted in women with breast cancer, and the evidence for survivors of childhood cancer is
limited. To accomplish our aims, we will use the largest prospectively followed childhood cancer survivor cohort
in the world, the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS; n>24,000), to recruit adult-aged participants at
increased risk of early CV disease (n=403) for a remotely conducted 12-month randomized controlled trial testing
a multi-faceted approach at improving PA and diet quality. Specifically, the study will use a sequential multiple
assignment randomized trial (SMART) design, where participants with low PA or poor diet will first be randomized
between intervention and control conditions. Intervention participants will be further randomized to receive either
clinician-led telehealth sessions focused on risk factor self-management, or weekly mobile health (mHealth)
supported individualized PA and dietary goal-setting with social media peer support. The adaptive SMART
design will allow further tailoring of the intervention experience based on initial response, which may increase
overall intervention efficacy. Participants not initially responsive to their assigned intervention will be further
randomized to receive an alternate intervention. The study will use consumer-grade mHealth applications that
track PA and diet, thereby increasing future dissemination capacity. The study’s primary analyses will determine
the overall intervention efficacy and whether specific intervention strategies and sequence of strategies are
associated with optimal outcomes. Secondary analyses will examine potential predictors, mediators, and
moderating factors associated with PA and dietary changes over time, as well as changes in participants’
cardiometabolic profiles. In summary, lifestyle change represents one of the few available strategies to mitigate
CV risk in childhood cancer survivors. Significant barriers (e.g., time, training, resources) limit the ability of
healthcare systems to facilitate such change. To fill this void, remote-based, personalized, and easily
disseminated multi-faceted mHealth-supported interventions may play a transformative role."
10902090,"HIV incidence remains unacceptably high for adolescent girls and young women (AGYW). Pre-exposure
prophylaxis (PrEP) HIV prevention tools are promising, with tenofovir (TFV)-based daily oral PrEP and the
dapivirine vaginal ring (DPV-VR) recommended by WHO for cisgender women at-risk for HIV. Kenya is a leader
for PrEP delivery in Africa and efforts are ongoing to increase PrEP access with AGYW as a priority group. Our
team pioneered integrated PrEP delivery in family planning (FP) clinics in Kenya; yet, 40% of Kenyan women
access contraception without interfacing with facilities, including at retail pharmacies, and would be missed by
facility-based PrEP platforms. Retail pharmacies can increase options for reaching at-risk individuals with PrEP
and efforts are underway to define pathways for pharmacy-delivered PrEP in Kenya. We adapted our FP clinic-
based PrEP model and piloted PrEP delivery facilitated by nurse-navigators for AGYW seeking contraception at
pharmacies. AGYW offered daily oral PrEP frequently initiated, planned to continue use, and were willing to pay
for PrEP at pharmacies. Pill burden was a common reason for declining oral PrEP and could be addressed by
offering DPV-VR. Through close collaboration with the Kenya Ministry of Health both, national- and county-level,
we propose a cluster RCT at 20 pharmacies in Kisumu, Kenya–a region with an HIV prevalence of up to 28%
among women–to test the effectiveness of utilizing nurse-navigators at retail pharmacies to enhance AGYW
PrEP use. We will expand on our successful pilot to offer both daily oral PrEP and the DPV-VR and prospectively
ascertain PrEP outcomes (initiation, persistence, adherence) among AGYW. This effectiveness-implementation
hybrid RCT is designed to expedite translation into practice by evaluating clinical effectiveness alongside
implementation and cost outcomes. We hypothesize that combining nurse-navigators with pharmacy-based
PrEP will provide a cost-effective strategy for delivering novel HIV prevention tools to AGYW in HIV high-burden
settings. Aim 1 will determine the effect of nurse-navigators on PrEP initiation, persistence, and adherence
among AGYW seeking contraception within a pharmacy-based PrEP delivery model through a 2-arm cluster
RCT among HIV-negative AGYW at 20 retail pharmacies in Kisumu, Kenya. AGYW seeking contraception will
be offered PrEP and self-select daily oral PrEP or the DVR-VR. Primary outcomes will be proportion of AGYW
accessing contraception that initiate PrEP, persist with use at 10 mos., and adhere (quantified by TFV or DPV
hair levels). Secondary outcomes will include PrEP selection (PrEP pills vs. DPV-VR), STI incidence, and
adherence cofactors. Aim 2 will identify potential barriers and facilitators to acceptability, feasibility, and client
satisfaction of nurse-navigators and DPV-VR delivery for AGYW accessing PrEP at retail pharmacies through a
qualitative evaluation guided by Proctor et al. Aim 3 will estimate the cost-effectiveness of implementing
pharmacy-based PrEP delivery with nurse-navigators. This will be the first study aiming to improve PrEP access
for AGYW using a pharmacy-based model and will prime pharmacies to deliver novel PrEP agents in the pipeline."

provide the financial support, mentoring, and other resources that investigators need to generate preliminary
data and successfully compete for extramural grant funding. The program is designed to further 4 key
objectives: 1) to foster the development of successful CTR investigators, 2) to support and develop
interdisciplinary CTR teams, 3) to develop innovative tools and technologies that will support remote conduct of
CTR or improve health outcomes, and 4) support CTR that evaluates the diverse causes of health-related
disparities in the region. The PPP supports these overall objectives through two specific aims: Specific Aim 1)
administer a CTR Pilot Projects Program that facilitates innovative and collaborative CTR programs and
Specific Aim 2) collaborate with the Cores and partner institutions to provide developmental CTR resources to
expand the pool of CTR investigators and teams. To successfully meet these specific aims, the PPP supports
interdisciplinary, team-based research that spans all GP IDeA- CTR partner institutions across the CTR
spectrum. Building on lessons learned and successes over the past four years, the portfolio of offered PPP
funding opportunities will be strategically expanded to include: 1) Team Development Pilots to provide initial
funding to foster new team formation, 2) Team Research Pilots to provide funding to existing CTR teams, and
3) Tech Transfer Pilots to support translation of intellectual property into clinical and community applications.
Resources from partner institutions will be leveraged to increase the number of available awards as well as
fund specialty awards focused on specific diseases (e.g., cancer or cardiovascular disease). The Pilot Projects
Program will collaborate with all Cores to advance CTR, including the Biostatistics, Epidemiology and
Research Design (BERD) Core and Community Engagement and Outreach (CEO) Core on their pilot grant
opportunities to strengthen the capacity for data science and trial design research as well as community-based
CTR projects, and with the Professional Development (PDC) Core to expand training and mentoring for pilot

for and success of CTR across all our partner institutions, reinforce local support for CTR-focused faculty, and
encourage sustainable intramural and interinstitutional collaboration on CTR for improved health outcomes for
Nebraska and across the Great Plains."
10922809,"Biomedical Informatics, Bioinformatics, and Cyberinfrastructure Enhancement Project Summary
The Biomedical Informatics, Bioinformatics, and Cyberinfrastructure Enhancement (BIBCE) Core offers a
robust and agile biomedical informatics infrastructure for the Great Plains (GP) IDeA-CTR members with
cutting-edge support tools, expertise and training across bio-, clinical-, and public health informatics realms.
Extensive reliance on genetic and molecular data in clinical practice has become a game-changer in health
care practice, especially, in the emerging field of precision medicine. Hence, clinical and translational research
(CTR) needs a range of supports from data collection and analysis to data integration and correlation to make
clinically relevant inferences effectively. However, it is extremely challenging for individual institutions to locally
develop and maintain sophisticated infrastructure and technical expertise in this rapidly changing field. The
primary objective of the BIBCE Core is to develop such an environment, expertise, tools, and services and
make them accessible across all institutions of the GP IDeA-CTR network. Collecting and connecting data from
the molecular level to population level, the BIBCE Core will provide access to a robust suite of tools for
regional CTR endeavors while building the overall CTR capacity of the GP IDeA-CTR network. While Nebraska
has an extensive telehealth network that links all public educational facilities and hospitals, informatics tools
and expert support are essential to generate multi-institutional collaborations in CTR and having a centrally
supported core will be pivotal to accomplish the mission of GP IDeA-CTR. The BIBCE Core will support this
mission with four specific aims: 1) Augment CTR capacity by leveraging existing infrastructure, networking,
and creative collaborations among GP IDeA-CTR, institutional, and other IDeA-funded projects; 2) Integrate
and streamline access to genomics-based and community health data, biobanks & registries, electronic health
records, and decision support systems across the network to promote translational precision health research;
3) Connect the clinical informatics resources with CTSA’s National Center for Data to Health (CD2H) and other
CTR centers to facilitate easy access and stimulate feasibility studies, outcomes research, and CTR; and 4)
Support data sharing, knowledge and resource sharing, and training using cyberinfrastructure to reach out to
the rural and underserved populations in the GP IDeA-CTR network. The BIBCE Core will have a profound
impact on the success of GP IDeA-CTR through augmenting the overall research capacity in the realms of
clinical, translational, and precision health; bolstering collaborations through team science within as well as
across the IDeA networks; streamlining diverse informatics resources; aligning the regional CTR with national
efforts for interoperability; sharing knowledge with new courses and training activities; and finally, developing

10907587,"Project Summary
Cardiac outflow tract (OFT) defects have an estimated prevalence of 1-2 in 1,000 live births. The
22q11.2 deletion syndrome or 22q11.2DS is one of the most frequent genetic causes of cardiac OFT defects. A
total of 60% of patients with 22q11.2DS have congenital heart disease that ranges from mild to severe including
bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), isolated ventricular septal defects (VSDs) to tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) or persistent
truncus arteriosus (PTA). These clinical findings suggest genetic modifiers may affect phenotypic expression
. In
this project, we propose to use the Lgdel/+ mouse model to understand the relationship between neural crest
cells (NCCs) and adjacent endocardial cells (ECCs) in forming and remodeling of the cardiac OFT.
Mesenchymal cells (MCs) derived from NCCs and ECCs occupy the distal and proximal OFT, respectively, and
form a distinct OFT MC boundary during heart development. Proper deployment of MCs from the two lineages
ensures correct position and formation of aorto-pulmonary-ventricular septum and semilunar valves to separate
the heart outlet into the systemic and pulmonary circulation. The function of NCCs in OFT defects has been well
studied with respect to 22q11.2DS, however, the role of ECCs in OFT malformations has not been investigated.
We have begun to fill this knowledge gap by studying the Lgdel/+ mouse, which was generated by deleting one
copy of the mouse syntenic region of human 22q11.2 containing 26 protein-coding genes (22q11.2DS genes).
We found a spectrum of OFT defects ranging from isolated VSD to TOF. The structural defects are preceded by
a disrupted OFT MC boundary, increased expression of Edn1 during endocardial-to-mesenchymal
transformation (EMT), and decreased NOTCH1 signaling and Ctgf expression during post-EMT OFT remodeling.
By single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we identified Edn1 as part of a unique gene program operating in
a subset of ECCs undergoing EMT. Based on these findings, we propose an overall hypothesis that 22q11.2DS
genes control OFT development by regulating the function of ECCs and the cell-cell communications between
MCs from ECC and NCC origins, via interacting with genes essential for OFT formation. We will test this
hypothesis in three specific aims. Aim 1 will determine whether the 22q11.2DS genes regulate EMT through
modulating the EMT gene program, and if Edn1 acts downstream of 22q11.2DS genes to regulate the process.
Aim 2 will ascertain whether 22q11.2DS genes also regulate OFT remodeling through a cell-cell interaction
network that patterns the OFT MC boundary, and if Ctgf functions as a hub gene required for the post-EMT OFT
remodeling, downstream of 22q11.2DS genes. Aim 3 will define whether Notch1 haploinsufficiency can
potentiate the 22q11.2DS OFT defects. At the completion of this study, we expect discoveries that will establish
genetic, molecular, and cell crosstalk regulated by important syndromic and non-syndromic CHD genes essential
for mouse OFT morphogenesis. The information will provide deeper understanding of heart developmental
biology and inform the disease mechanism of OFT defects, with a broader implication in congenital heart
disease."
10911050,"More than one million Americans suffer from Parkinson’s disease (PD), of whom at least 80,000 are
Veterans. Although PD is currently diagnosed on the basis of motor signs, these manifestations are preceded
by a period that lasts several years to decades, in which neurodegeneration spreads to many brain regions. The
earlier we can detect PD, the longer the window of opportunity to treat it before disabling symptoms appear.
Learning how to prevent disabling symptoms will require identifying markers that not only enable accurate early
diagnosis, but also enhance understanding of disease pathogenesis, paving the way for the development of
early intervention with disease-modifying drugs. Sense of smell is the first casualty of PD. Although the possibility
of using olfaction as a biomarker for PD has garnered increased interest in recent years, it will only be possible
once we have achieved a better understanding of the mechanisms of this olfactory loss and its cause-and-effect
relationship to -synuclein pathology, a hallmark of PD.
 Our over-arching hypothesis is that olfactory damage in PD is an early event directly linked to upstream -
synuclein toxicity and based on specific neuroanatomical changes with measurable functional impact. By
capitalizing on a well-established transgenic mouse model overexpressing human wild-type -synuclein in the
brain, we showed in our current VAMR a causative role for -synuclein pathology in cerebral blood flow (CBF)
deficit and olfactory dysfunction in PD. To develop further the potential of olfactory dysfunction as a multi-faceted
biomarker, we seek in-depth understanding of the role of CBF alterations in olfactory dysfunction, including its
mechanistic relationship to -synuclein pathology. Using the -synuclein transgenic mouse, we will assess how
progressive accumulation of -synuclein leads to disruption of the counter-regulatory mechanism between the
brain renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and dopamine, leading to abnormal local upregulation of the RAS and
deficits in CBF. In addition, we will elucidate the role of progressive -synuclein accumulation in metabolic
dysregulation, altered energy homeostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation,
as well as the relationships of these processes to CBF deficit and olfactory dysfunction. Our approach features
immunohistochemistry, biochemistry, behavioral assessments, and advanced neuroimaging modalities (arterial
spin-labeling MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, and fMRI) that are readily translatable to patients.
 Focusing on progressive -synucleinopathy in transgenic mice at 4, 9, and 16 months of age, representing
prodromal, preclinical, and clinical stages of PD, respectively, our specific objectives are:
 1. To elucidate the relationship between abnormal-synuclein aggregation and CBF deficit in PD-related
 olfactory dysfunction;
 2. To understand the mechanism of -synuclein overexpression-induced oxidative stress and
 neuroinflammation, leading to CBF deficit and impaired sense of smell; and
 3. To explore the relationship between abnormal -synuclein aggregation and the dysregulation of energy
 homeostasis in PD-related olfactory dysfunction.
 These studies are significant, as the results will substantially enhance understanding of the mechanistic
relationships among olfactory loss, CBF deficit, and -synucleinopathy in PD, thereby accelerating efforts to
move much-needed early diagnosis to clinical reality. Our approaches are innovative since they exploit cutting-
edge non-invasive multimodal MRI in a fashion that could be readily translated to the clinic. Owing to our
investigative team’s in-depth expertise in olfaction, PD, neurodegeneration, oxidative stress, inflammation,
neurobehavioral testing, and advanced imaging technologies, along with the unique advantage of an 11.7 Tesla
magnet for high-resolution MRI, the proposed studies have high feasibility."

 Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) maintain the adult blood and immune systems throughout the lifetime
of an organism. While HSC transplants are used clinically for the curative treatment of patients with leukemias,
lymphomas, and immune disorders, the success of HSC transplants varies considerably, with some patients
having to undergo multiple transplants due to inefficient HSC engraftment. The goal of the proposed project is
to identify how the heparan sulfate proteoglycan, Syndecan-2, regulates HSC maintenance and regeneration.
Aim 1 will utilize newly generated tissue-specific knockout mice to analyze the contribution of Syndecan-2 in
regulating HSC engraftment, while performing a structure-function analysis of the molecular motifs of Syndecan-
2 in mediating engraftment and niche regeneration. Aim 2 will analyze the role of Syndecan-2 in regulating
hematopoietic recovery from stress by combining radiation injury and myelosuppression in vivo models of HSC
self-renewal. These experiments will demonstrate the role of Syndecan-2 in mediating HSCs maintenance and
regeneration, providing foundational knowledge to enable further study of how proteoglycans regulate HSCs.
The knowledge procured from the completion of the proposed aims is expect to have broad potential
contributions to patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiation therapy as a part of their treatment regimen for
variety of cancers, immune diseases, leukemias and anemias and therapeutic value from a public health
standpoint for treating patients that experience accidental radiation exposure.
 My career goals are to become an assistant professor at a top-tier academic research institution. I aim
to lead a research program that investigates how proteoglycans regulate HSCs and the HSC microenvironment
at homeostasis and during stress. To achieve these goals, the proposed project has embedded training in
modeling HSC recovery from injury, while expanding my knowledge of glycobiology and growth factor signaling.
Under this award, I will pursue the proposed training with the mentorship of Dr. John Chute (UCLA), who has
substantial experience in translational modeling of HSC and niche regeneration, while supported by an Advisory
Committee with expertise in stem cell biology, growth factor signaling and proteoglycan biology. As a
postdoctoral fellow, I will present my work at international conferences and to my mentoring committee, which
consists of experts in the field. As junior faculty, I will receive training in laboratory management/leadership, grant
writing, negotiation, and mentoring to help me lead a successful research team. The proposed project will allow
me to transition to an independent research position while developing my skillset in HSC biology. UCLA has
superb research facilities, professional development resources and administrative support, which will provide
the necessary infrastructure to support my research and career development as a mentored postdoctoral fellow
and ultimately, my transition to independence."

Stroke is the fourth leading cause of disability within the United States. Large vessel occlusion (LVO) subtype of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is the most devastating among all. Recent pivotal trials demonstrated endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) to be highly beneficial in selected subsets of AIS patients. In the wake of these breakthrough studies, an urgent need exists to assess the benefit of EVT in broader populations that are likely to benefit and determine the limits of this therapy, and to address multiple pressing related issues of management and concomitant therapies, in formal clinical trials. To answer multiple EVT management questions efficiently and concurrently, the NIH StrokeNet National Data Management Center (NDMC) at the Medical University of South Carolina, along with the National Coordinating Center and StrokeNet Thrombectomy Endovascular Platform (STEP) Executive Committee, will develop a robust EVT clinical trial platform within NIH StrokeNet. STEP will be optimized to definitely answer EVT-related questions under an overarching Master Protocol, providing an inferentially integrated framework and shared infrastructure, as a randomized, multi-factorial, Bayesian, adaptive platform trial. The STEP trial team will develop operational cores and scientific advisory groups designed to support three broad categories of trials: expansion of EVT indications, innovative EVT devices and concomitant medical therapies, and novel pre- and early-hospital technologies and systems of care. The foundational STEP Master Protocol will define the largest set of inclusion/exclusion criteria to allow study of all consecutive AIS patients with a visible large or medium intracranial vessel occlusion. It also will outline overall study procedures and terminologies, and the unifying statistical inferential model. As a registry-leveraged trial, STEP will minimize burden on the sites by collecting data using an automated transfer mechanism from existing robust, high-quality national clinical registries. Assessment of distinct interventions will be feasible on the platform concurrently or in tandem, and co-enrollment in multiple interventions and sharing of controls will be allowed to maximize efficiency. Details of a mutually exclusive set of interventions are called Domains. The details of patients eligible for a given domain, details of intervention, rules for randomization and adaptation would subsequently be detailed in domain-specific Appendices to the STEP master protocol. The primary endpoint of the STEP trial is favorable global disability level at 90 days, assessed using utility-weighted analysis of the modified Rankin scale (mRS). The STEP trial will allow most efficient testing of treatment strategies and allow rapid optimization of endovascular treatment landscape and acute stroke care."

The Duke University Division of Neonatology enthusiastically submits this renewal application for
participation in the Eunice Kennedy Shriver NICHD-sponsored Cooperative Multicenter Neonatal
Research Network (NRN). Duke is submitting the application in collaboration with the University
of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) and East Carolina University (ECU), as the North Carolina
Clinical Center (NCCC) for the NRN. To support the NRN Duke's and the NCCC's aims are to: 1)
enroll demographically diverse patients in NRN studies and achieve high follow-up rates, 2)
develop innovative trial designs and concepts for NRN studies, and 3) develop the next generation
of clinical research leaders in Neonatology via interactions with the NRN.
In support of the 3 aims Duke has added satellite sites to increase eligible patient populations and
broaden opportunities for NRN interactions. Duke was the first NRN site to add an independent
academic institution when the UNC joined Duke in 2008. ECU, located in Greenville, NC, joined
in 2018. The NCCC has been among the top 5 enrolling sites among recently completed and
currently enrolling NRN trials. Follow-up for over 250 infants enrolled in clinical trials has been
over 95%. Follow-up for infants in the NRN observational trials is 86%, slightly above the NRN
overall rate of 84%. The NCCC UNC site PI leads the NRN PDA trial. In the last cycle, over 20
NCCC investigators co-authored 52 NRN publications, including 9 first-author papers.
NCCC sites will continue maximizing enrollment efforts and maintain high follow-up rates for NRN
studies. The NCCC leadership will provide significant clinical trial experience to the NRN, and will
bring innovative concepts such as a Global Rank Score for composite outcomes and new study
designs such as master protocols to promote efficient conduct of and comparisons between trials.
We will initiate a Protocol Incubator system to support protocol development by early career
investigators. In addition, we will bring concepts for studies to validate new technology, including
testing of optical coherence tomography for retinal imaging and associations with visual acuity
and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Duke, UNC, and ECU fully support the NCCC's ongoing
collaborative commitment to the NRN. We firmly believe that our NRN interactions have improved
care of infants in our three institutions, and throughout our State. We are highly motivated to
improve outcomes of infants, and support development of the next generation of clinician
scientists in Neonatology, by working with the NRN."
10873820,"Project Summary
 The overarching goal of this project is to enable the use of engineered cell therapies to safely and effectively
treat conditions ranging across cancer, autoimmune disease, and regenerative medicine. Engineered cell
therapies are an exciting frontier, with early successes in cancer treatment demonstrating the transformative
potential of this approach. Customized cell therapies could yield safe and effective treatments for many
applications beyond cancer, but realizing this potential is limited by the fact that evaluating a potential therapeutic
strategy requires extensive time and resources to implement it. The goal of this project is to flip this paradigm—
to enable spending less time building and thus focus on evaluating potentially useful strategies.
 This project will develop state-of-the-art technologies for cell engineering and enable their application to solve
three open, complementary, clinically motivated challenges. The first aim is to develop the technology,
understanding, and computational tools required to build genetic programs that employ natural mechanisms for
implementing long-lived memory. Natural systems employ genetic memory to drive processes such as
differentiation and development by adding and removing stable marks to the genome. Although research has
yielded insights into how to drive such changes, bioengineers do not yet have the ability to leverage those
insights to build programs that implement these effects for useful purposes. This project will address this need
by developing genetic programs that exhibit stable behaviors including inducible and autonomous state
switching. The second aim will generate novel candidate cell therapies for treating cancer that leverage
foundational advances for engineering cells to evaluate and respond to external cues (e.g., unique markers of
the tumor site) to induce desired therapeutic behaviors. This work will develop programs hypothesized to improve
both safety and efficacy of these approaches. A key aspect of this work is employing model-guided design to
evaluate and refine genetic programs to confer desired behaviors. The third aim will develop a computational
framework enabling computer-assisted design of genetic programs. Current design is limited by the imagination
of the designer—a human must propose a design which is subsequently evaluated. This aim will make the
transformative leap to semi-automated design, establishing workflows and tools that are freely accessible to
researchers in a graphics-enabled open software framework."
10890760,"ABSTRACT
Bacillus anthracis, the anthrax agent, is a member of the Bacillus cereus sensu lato group, which includes
invasive pathogens of mammals or insects as well as nonpathogenic environmental strains. Clade 1 members
of the B. cereus s.l. group can exchange virulence-plasmids via horizontal transfer with B. anthracis to cause
anthrax-like disease too. The natural route of infection is ingestion, often by grazing animals or, in humans, by
the consumption of spore-contaminated food (gastrointestinal, GI anthrax). The proposal aims to determine
the mechanisms of B. anthracis spore invasion across intestinal epithelia. The central hypothesis is that spores
of B. anthracis and anthrax-causing strains germinate in the intestinal tract of infected animals. Our working
model postulates that vegetative bacilli secrete several enzymes with mucin-binding and mucin-degrading
activities to penetrate the thick mucin layer. Next, the adhesins BslA and BslB mediate uptake of B. anthracis
into intestinal cells. BslA and BslB are two of 22 S-layer associated proteins (BSLs) that form the surface (S)-
protein layer. BSLs associate via S-layer homology (SLH)-domains with secondary cell wall polysaccharide
(SCWP), a peptidoglycan linked carbohydrate polymer. The integrity of the S-layer and SCWP is important for
the activity of BSLs. Further, the bslA gene is located on the mobilizable pXO1 virulence plasmid. Thus, we
propose that surface-protein layers contribute broadly to the pathogenesis of anthrax-causing organisms. Here,
we will use mice and intestinal organoids to model GI anthrax and test our predictions. We propose to study
the pathway for the synthesis of SCWP that is required to display the surface-protein layer and is essential for
growth. We expect that the elucidation of the assembly pathway of SCWP will serve as a paradigm for the
study of other complex polymers of Gram-positive bacteria and reveal new targets of antibacterial drugs. We
anticipate that unravelling intestinal mucosa interactions with anthrax and anthrax-like pathogens will
collectively advance the field of infectious diseases research."
10873130,"Project Summary/Abstract
Genome sequence data is now available for hundreds of thousands of species. Our ability to exploit this vast trove
of information about the molecular basis and evolution of life depends on sophisticated computational analysis
tools. One important class of tools is proﬁle analysis software, for making consensus statistical models of multiple
alignments of biological sequence families, and for using those models to sensitively detect homologs and make
deep multiple alignments. Proﬁle analysis derives its power from the fact that despite the unbounded growth
of sequence data, the majority of functional sequences can be condensed into a manageably small number of
conserved families. Proﬁle software underlies numerous protein, RNA, and DNA sequence family databases. The
systematic availability of deep multiple alignments (of many thousands of sequences) is enabling revolutionary
advances in predicting molecular function and 3D structure by comparative sequence analysis.
 The HMMER and Infernal software packages from our laboratory are some of the most widely used tools
for proﬁle analysis. HMMER implements proﬁle hidden Markov models (proﬁle HMMs) of primary sequence
consensus, typically for protein domains and conserved DNA elements. Infernal implements proﬁle stochastic
context-free grammars (proﬁle SCFGs) of RNA secondary structure and sequence consensus. In the context of
the continued development of these packages, this proposal has three speciﬁc aims for new lines of research
that we expect to lead to major improvements in the accuracy, utility, and computational efﬁciency of proﬁle anal-
ysis. The ﬁrst aim proposes to develop a discontinuous Markov model of nonhomologous sequences, to improve
the ability to distinguish homologs from nonhomologs and reduce the false positive rate of database searches.
The second aim proposes to develop sketching methods for efﬁciently representing the voluminous results of a
database homology search with a subset of the most phylogenetically informative hits. The third aim proposes
to develop adaptive computation methods to ﬂexibly harness the complex mix of CPU/GPU processors, mem-
ory, and storage in modern hardware architectures, enabling efﬁcient scalable computation and near-interactive
database search times."
10918264,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Bowel resection leads to the devastating condition of Short Bowel Syndrome (SBS). SBS patients cannot
maintain nutrition through regular enteral nutrition (EN) due to insufficient intestines. Such patients, in the
absence of EN, require intravenous nutrition via a process called Total Parenteral nutrition (TPN) for survival.
Worldwide, tens of thousands of patients require TPN. Despite the lifesaving TPN, side effects in SBS include
potentially fatal liver and gut injury. Although, many researchers have focused on the detrimental effects of the
constituents of TPN, results from our published studies highlight our novel hypothesis that the state of luminal
content deprivation in SBS, disrupts the normal gut derived signals and drives injury mechanisms in SBS.
 Our published data shows that during EN, as part of normal enterohepatic circulation of bile acids (BA),
activation of gut Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) by BA results in release of Fibroblast Growth Factor 19 (FGF19).
FGF19 regulates hepatic BA, cholestasis, lipid, and glucose homeostasis. Due to a lack of gut FXR activation
in SBS we hypothesize that the FXR-FGF19 signaling axis is impaired. We have also published that BA
prevent gut atrophy by enhancing Glucagon Like Peptides (GLPs). GLPs are regulated via BA activated gut
receptor TGR5. While GLP-2 is a gut trophic factor; GLP-1 modulates hepatic steatosis, insulin, and glucose.
We hypothesize that inadequate gut TGR5 activation in SBS additionally drives liver and gut injury.
 Novel Model: We have established a novel untethered ambulatory SBS piglet model using miniature pumps,
jugular and duodenal catheters, and surgical bowel resection (SLU#2346,43-R-011) to closely recapitulate
human SBS. Proof of Concept: We have published that in animals on TPN without bowel resection (and not
receiving EN), treatment with gut FXR agonist, Chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) or gut TGR5 agonist Oleanolic
Acid (OA), as well as intravenous FGF19 and GLP-1/GLP-2 can prevent liver and gut injury. Importantly, we
have shown inadequate gut FXR and gut TGR5 activation and decreased FGF19, GLP-1/GLP-2 in SBS
animals. In pilot studies we have noted hepatic and gut protection with CDCA and OA treatment in SBS.
 Thus, our central premise is to critically understand alteration in gut FXR and gut TGR5 driven signaling in
SBS and to test if its restoration in SBS animals mitigates injury. As detailed in the research plan, we will test
our hypothesis under the following aims. With Aim 1 we will critically test the roles of intravenous FGF19 and
the gut FXR agonist, CDCA on liver injury in SBS. We will analyze serum, histology, key receptors, and
transporters along the FXR-FGF19 axis to understand mechanistic links. With Aim 2 we will deliver the gut
TGR5 agonist, OA as well as GLP-1/GLP-2 in SBS animals and explore TGR5-GLP axis driven protective
mechanisms in SBS, assessing serology, histology, gut trophic factors, morphometrics and gene expression.
This project, using a highly translatable SBS model will help advance strategies to mitigate serious
complications and provide key insights into drivers of injury in SBS."

The scientific goal of this K23 is to apply cutting-edge data science approaches to identify novel subphenotypes
within the heterogeneous sepsis syndrome. This K23 application proposes a 5-year training program to propel
Dr. Sivasubramanium Bhavani towards his career as an independent physician-scientist. Dr. Bhavani’s career
goal is to be an expert in developing computer-aided diagnostic tools to map the extensive clinical and biological
data in the electronic health record (EHR) to personalized treatment plans for critically ill patients. Dr. Bhavani
will accomplish this career goal by completing 3 short-term goals: 1) Gain expertise in unsupervised machine
learning, 2) Gain expertise in deep learning neural networks, and 3) Gain expertise in clinical informatics
principles for model application to real-world data. Dr. Bhavani has outlined an integrated program of didactics,
seminars, conferences, and consistent communication with expert mentors to provide the necessary career
development. Dr. Bhavani’s mentors are Dr. Craig Coopersmith, a past president of the Society of Critical Care
Medicine with a long career of NIH-funded sepsis research, and Dr. May Wang, a renowned expert in machine
learning. In addition, Dr. Bhavani’s advisors are Drs. John Hanfelt, Annette Esper, Matthew Semler and Matthew
Churpek, with collective expertise in longitudinal clustering, sepsis biomarkers, and bioinformatics. With the
support of the K23, Dr. Bhavani will contribute to the development of precision medicine approaches to sepsis.
Sepsis is a severe and heterogeneous syndrome characterized by a dysregulated host response to infection that
results in over 270,000 deaths in the U.S. annually. Decades of clinical trials have failed to identify therapies that
consistently benefit patients with sepsis. The one-size-fits-all treatment approach has not worked, and there is a
need to identify sepsis subphenotypes that may have different responses to treatment. To date, most studies
have identified sepsis subphenotypes using static measurements of labs and vital signs. However, sepsis is a
dynamic process with biological and physiological responses that evolve over minutes to hours. The objective of
this proposal is to identify novel sepsis subphenotypes using dynamic data, specifically longitudinal vital signs.
In Aim 1, Dr. Bhavani will apply cutting-edge machine learning algorithms to longitudinal vital signs to develop
and validate novel vitals trajectory subphenotypes. In Aim 2, Dr. Bhavani will investigate the immune signatures
of these subphenotypes. In Aim 3, Dr. Bhavani will study the responses of the subphenotypes to one of the most
common interventions in sepsis – intravenous fluids. Identification of subphenotypes with responses to different
fluids could shift sepsis management from a one-size-fits-all approach to a precision medicine approach – the
ultimate objective of sepsis subphenotypes. Through the training in this K23, Dr. Bhavani will be prepared for
R01-level work in a) refining subphenotypes by combining dynamic clinical and immunological data and b)
studying the responses of subphenotypes to additional treatments by using data from other RCTs."

10840989,"The ebolaviruses (EBOV, SUDV, BDBV) and marburgviruses (MARV and RAVV), cause periodic outbreaks of
severe viral hemorrhagic fever with very high mortality rates. The 2013-2016 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak
in West Africa highlighted the serious nature of a filovirus epidemic and its regional and global implications. This
outbreak took an enormous toll on people at the front line of the epidemic control, i.e., physicians, nurses, hospital
personnel, social workers, and other support staff. Many nurses and physicians lost their lives helping patients
and many left their profession out of fear of exposure. The near breakdown of the local healthcare system further
fueled the spread of the virus across the region. Therefore, protection of the first responders must be a high
priority and is critical for successful outbreak control. Currently, while a prophylactic vaccine is available for
EVD, there are no therapeutic or prophylactic countermeasures available for Marburg virus disease (MVD) which
has led to many outbreaks and as recently as June 2022. The objective of this proposal is to develop an effective
immunoprophylactic for protection of first responders against MVD. Such a product mut be 1) extremely potent
to enable economically affordable low dose levels, and 2) have extended bioavailability to provide a reasonably
long duration of protection. We and others have isolated several classes of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies
(mAbs) for ebolaviruses. However, for marburgviruses only a single class of mAbs against the glycoprotein (GP)
has been described that all target a single epitope within the receptor binding site (RBS) of MARV and RAVV
GP. Now, using a novel immunization and B cell selection approach with rationally designed antigens we have
succeeded in identifying a new class of mAbs that bind to a novel epitope and neutralize marburgviruses at sub-
to low-nM concentrations and are up to 100-fold more potent than the RBS binders. A lead antibody, R217, has
been selected and shown to protect against MVD in mice, guinea pigs, and nonhuman primates (NHPs). In this
SBIR project we propose to engineer the Fc portion of this macaque-human chimeric antibody by introducing
mutations (YTE) in the FcRn binding region to extend the half-life of the antibody and evaluate the efficacy of
the product. In Aim 1 R217-YTE will be produced in ExpiCHO cells and fully characterized. Pharmacokinetics
(PK) will be evaluated in NHPs. In Aim 2, the efficacy of R217-YTE against MVD will be evaluated in the settings
of pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis and the required dose level and serum neutralization activity required for
protection will be determined. Aim 3 will be focused on generation of a stable manufacturing cell line in CHO
cells and a research cell bank to be used for production of future GMP cell banks. If successful, we anticipate
further development of the product under DoD or BARDA funding and approval under FDA Animal Rule."

platelets, circulating coagulation factors, and immune system function, which make it difficult to assess using a
single biomarker. Conventional coagulation tests are informative, but most are not adequate for acute
hemorrhage control due to long result turnaround times (> 45 minutes). Viscoelastic coagulation tests,
alternatively, can rapidly detect the presence of abnormal clotting, but necessitate longer test times (30-45
minutes) to provide results that may be used to determine specific changes in treatment. Repeated monitoring
of hemostasis is recommended for bleeding trauma patients, however, the cumulative blood loss required for
central laboratory coagulation tests (1-2 mL per test) increases the risk of iatrogenic anemia. The optimal
coagulation panel for rapid, recurrent assessment of coagulation in trauma patients does not yet exist.
To address the critical unmet need for rapid, low volume tests for the diagnosis and therapeutic management of
coagulopathy in trauma patients, we will develop a four-assay panel and corresponding near-patient digital
microfluidic (DMF) platform that will provide clinically actionable data to guide the administration of whole blood
transfusion and other blood products. Our innovative technology will simultaneously measure prothrombin
time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), fibrinogen, and
platelet count from < 50 µL of whole blood. All assay operations, including plasma separation from whole blood,
will be performed autonomously, facilitating use by minimally trained users in near-patient settings such as the
emergency department and operating room. By combining four essential assays in a single protocol with a time-
to-result of under 10 minutes, our system will better inform transfusion requirements, reduce iatrogenic blood
loss from recurrent coagulation monitoring, and improve clinical workflow in busy trauma settings.
Phase I of this Fast-Track SBIR project will establish feasibility of the testing panel by developing a DMF
instrument capable of simultaneously measuring PT/INR, aPTT, and fibrinogen on a single disposable cartridge.
We will also validate DMF-compatible hardware for the optical system required for platelet count measurement.
Phase II will integrate the optical system and complementary cartridge into our existing DMF platform to support
full automation of the platelet count assay. We will then multiplex the assays in a single run and evaluate the
analytical and clinical performance of each test. Our final product will be marketed for use in general and military
trauma settings during triage and perioperative periods, with secondary markets including adult and pediatric
patients undergoing surgery or other procedures that raise the risk for hemorrhage and shock."

This Phase IIB SBIR grant application proposes to continue development and commercialization of OsteoDx’s
Cortical Bone Mechanics Technology™ (CBMT™), a novel osteoporosis related diagnostic device that non-
invasively measures the mechanical properties of cortical bone and provides direct information about bone
strength and quality that is not accessible by other diagnostic modalities. OsteoDx has already successfully
illustrated commercial feasibility and demonstrated that CBMT can accurately and efficiently estimate ulna bone
bending strength (R2=0.99). OsteoDx also established that CBMT is sensitive to detecting change in bone
strength and provides information about cortical bone that is unique and independent of Bone Mineral Density
(BMD), which suggests CBMT may yield clinically significant information about osteoporotic fracture potential.
Osteoporosis is a common medical condition causing progressive weakening of bones, eventually leading to
nontraumatic or fragility fractures. These fractures are painful and, in many cases, cause prolonged or life-long
disability, and dramatically increases mortality rates up to 8x within 3 months post fracture. The Bone Health and
Osteoporosis Foundation projects that by 2025, there will be 3 million osteoporosis related fractures every year
in the US, resulting in healthcare costs of more than $57 billion. Numerous treatments with varying mechanisms
of action exist for osteoporosis and, if given to high-risk individuals, could dramatically reduce the risk of fracture.
However, current osteoporosis treatment decisions are heavily driven by X-ray based measurements of BMD
and risk surveys. Unfortunately, these tools lack sufficient discriminatory sensitivity and accuracy to identify many
individuals at high risk of experiencing a fragility fracture. For instance, <50% of the variation in whole-bone
strength is attributable to variations in BMD, and the vast majority of patients who sustain fragility fractures do
not have low BMD (i.e., they have T-score’s above −2.5). Thus, there is a large unmet need to better diagnose
patients who are at risk of fracture, so that physicians can accurately identify individuals who would benefit from
osteoporosis medications and to better monitor the effectiveness of treatment. OsteoDx’s market research,
interviews with key opinion leaders, and prior meetings with the FDA have identified the most important and
immediate commercialization milestones necessary for FDA approval and market adoption: a study that
demonstrates the accuracy (aim 1) and clinical precision (aim 2) of the final design production version of the
medical device, and advances safety and regulatory compliance (aim 3). Thus, in this Phase II application we
propose a series of experiments, tests, and approaches to accomplish the above-mentioned aims. Upon
successful achievement of these aims, OsteoDx will be positioned to submit a Class II de novo medical device
application to the FDA for noninvasively quantifying flexural rigidity of cortical bone in the ulna. To achieve the
aims of this proposal and the other commercialization objectives of OsteoDx, the company has assembled a
highly seasoned team with broad experience and expertise."
10861085,"Gadolinium (Gd)-based MRI contrast agents (GBCAs) are used in clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
for cancer detection and staging, particularly of primary and metastatic brain cancers. However, there are
concerns about the potential long-term toxicity of GBCAs. GBCAs cause nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF),
a devastating disorder that affects patients with kidney disease. FDA imposed a “black box” warning against
GBCA use in this population. This has a significant medical impact: 16% of US adults suffer from moderate or
severe chronic kidney disease (CKD), and this patient population is disproportionately afflicted with comorbidities
like cancer (where many chemotherapies are nephrotoxic). There is no alternative imaging for these patients.
Contrast enhanced CT can cause acute and irreversible kidney injury and is also contraindicated. All GBCAs
cause accumulation of Gd in the brain and bone, even in patients with normal kidney function. Gd is highly toxic
in its free form, and little is known about the toxicological implications of deposited Gd: concern is rising among
physicians, patients, and regulatory agencies. In 2017 the FDA announced a new class warning for all GBCAs.
The European Medicines Agency suspended the marketing authorizations for the 4 GBCAs that are associated
with the highest risk of Gd deposition, and arguably may have removed all GBCAs had there been a safe, Gd-
free alternative. Accumulation of Gd is particularly worrisome for cancer survivors and those at high risk for
cancer, e.g. BRCA positive women. They require regular GBCA-enhanced MRIs for surveillance or screening,
and may have dozens of MRIs through life. Avoiding GBCAs forces physicians to make key patient management
decisions with limited imaging information, while continued use may put these vulnerable patients at risk.
 Reveal Pharmaceuticals is developing the gadolinium-free MRI contrast agent, RVP-001, invented at
Massachusetts General Hospital. RVP-001 provides equivalent image contrast to commercial GBCAs in different
animal models. Manganese (Mn) injected as RVP-001 is more efficiently eliminated than Gd from an equal dose
of Gd-DOTA, which is considered the best in class GBCA for safety with respect to stability. Nonclinical studies
established a very high safety margin for RVP-001. A Phase 1 study to assess safety, tolerability, and
pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects demonstrated that RVP-001 is safe and well tolerated up to doses higher
than the anticipated clinical dose. This grant will support first in human MR imaging studies. We will perform a
dose range finding study in patients with GBCA-enhancing central nervous system lesions, e.g. brain cancers,
to assess imaging efficacy, pharmacodynamics, and safety. We will assess the degree of RVP-001 lesion
enhancement compared to unenhanced MRI and compared to the patient’s GBCA enhanced MRI. The goal of
the study is to establish an effective dose for further clinical development and approval.
 This grant application is predicated on the Fast Track NIH grant award R44 DK113906-03 and is a
resubmission of the grant application 9 R44 CA261240-04"

 Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a lethal blood cancer characterized by a differentiation “block” that prevents
myeloid progenitor maturation resulting in uncontrolled proliferation. Chemotherapy, the current standard of care,
is often ineffective and can result in cytotoxicity and relapse. New treatment options are desperately needed to
treat AML’s poor prognosis. Differentiation therapy is a novel method that aims to reactivate latent maturation
programs and induce cell cycle exit. This therapeutic strategy is curative in the promyelocytic (APL) AML subtype
but underexplored in other AMLs. Epigenetic factors help sustain the characteristic AML differentiation block.
The demethylase LSD1 has emerged as a promising target for differentiation therapy. Pharmacologic inhibition
of LSD1 (LSD1i) induces cellular differentiation in many AML subtypes. However, the extent of differentiation
varies between AML models, with a modest effect in aggressive AML models. Therefore, LSD1i will not induce
terminal differentiation as a monoagent treatment. We hypothesized that targeting additional epigenetic
regulators simultaneously with LSD1i may induce complete, terminal differentiation and lead to disease
remission. To identify potentiators of LSD1i, we conducted CRISPR gain-of-differentiation screens with a
chromatin-focused sgRNA library in multiple AML cell models with or without LSD1i co-treatment. These screens
unveiled a synergistic induction of differentiation when KO of MEN1 is combined with LSD1i. I confirmed that
combinatorial small molecule inhibition of LSD1 and MEN1 induces differentiation and reduces proliferation most
commonly in MLL-rearranged AMLs, and to a lesser extent in selected MLL-wild type AMLs. This proposal has
two aims: First, I will test the therapeutic potential of targeting MEN1 in combination with LSD1 inhibitors in
primary patient samples ex vivo and in patient-derived AML transplant models. Patient samples will be treated
with a MEN1 inhibitor in combination with LSD1 inhibitors, and effects on differentiation and proliferation will be
quantified. Secondly, I will determine the epigenomic mechanisms by which MEN1 and LSD1 inhibition synergize
to induce terminal differentiation, and then test whether these mechanisms are conserved in primary patient
samples."

 In neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia (SCZ), genetic and environmental factors converge
on disrupted brain development and function. One way that we can gain more clarity on the relationships between
genes, neural systems, and symptoms is through considering rare genetic conditions with large effects on brain
development. 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome (22qDel) is a recurrent copy number variant (CNV) in which a
hemizygous deletion of ~2.6 Mb of genetic material (~46 protein-coding genes) from chromosome 22 causes a
neurodevelopmental phenotype with a ~25% risk of psychotic illness and increased rates of ASD, intellectual
disability, attention deficit and anxiety disorders. Studying individuals with 22qDel can therefore provide an
impactful translational model and ‘genetics-first’ framework for understanding the complex biological pathways
underlying disabling conditions like SCZ. The proposed research plan seeks to map convergent and divergent
brain connectivity disruptions in 22qDel and in individuals at Clinical High Risk (CHR) for developing psychosis
spectrum disorders relative to typically developing (TD) controls. To this end, we will make use of the largest
multi-site sample collected to date of longitudinal resting-state fMRI from 22qDel (n=217) and matched controls
(n=149), along with data from the North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study (NAPLS) with CHR (n=318) and
TD (n=206). We will also apply spatial transcriptomic data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA) to test
relationships between fMRI biomarkers and typical spatial patterns of gene expression in the brain. Specifically,
our aims are to: (i) Test the hypothesis that functional connectivity disruptions in individuals with genetic and
clinical risk factors for psychosis converge on brain-wide sensory and executive networks, (ii) Test the hypothesis
that 22qDel and CHR will exhibit convergent disruptions in functional connectivity development across the age
range relative to TD controls, and that individual deviations from typical trajectories will predict psychosis
symptoms, and (iii) Test the hypothesis that spatial patterns of resting-state fMRI disruptions in 22qDel are
related to spatial gradients of inhibitory and excitatory neuronal gene expression in post-mortem brain tissue
from typical adults. This multimodal approach aims to elucidate brain biomarkers and neurobiological
mechanisms related to genetic and clinical risk factors for psychosis spectrum disorders. To facilitate this
research, the proposed training plan includes coursework, workshops, and professional development activities
related to analysis of multi-site data, longitudinal data analysis, neurogenetics, and science communication. The
Bearden Lab and Neuroscience Interdepartmental Program at the University of California Los Angeles will
provide the ideal academic environment for the proposed training and research plan."
10917171,"Project Summary
Electronic Nicotine Delivery System (ENDS, or e-cigarette) is a new class of tobacco products and may represent
a reduced harm alternative for combustible cigarette smokers. In 2020, 3.7% (9.2 million) of adults aged 18 years
and older reported current use of ENDS. Current everyday or some-day ENDS use is most prevalent among
current cigarette smokers (13.8%) and former smokers (13.3%) and is uncommon among adult never smokers
(2.2%). E-liquid nicotine concentration level is one of the primary product-level determinants of nicotine delivery
and sensorimotor characteristics and there is a variety of nicotine concentration levels available in ENDS.
Modern vaping products (e.g., pod-mod style like JUUL) contain nicotine in the salt formulation and tend to
deliver nicotine to the lung more efficiently. Most recently, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted
several ENDS products in the Premarket Tobacco Product Marketing review with varying nicotine levels, such
as 0% (Logic Pro), 1.5% (Vuse Ciro), 3.0% (Vuse Viper), 4.5% (NJOY Daily Rich), and 6.0% (NJOY Daily Extra
Rich). Meanwhile, FDA announced plans for proposed rules to reduce nicotine levels to minimally addictive or
non-addictive levels among cigarettes (Cig). The research on the effects of e-liquid nicotine concentration levels,
especially how different nicotine levels are related to health effects, tobacco use behaviors, and nicotine
dependence and how nicotine levels interplay with vaping devices at the population level, can have important
implications for future tobacco regulatory sciences. This large-scale population study will link the Population
Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Waves 1-6 restricted biomarker with the PATH Adult Interview
surveys. In Aim 1, we will analyze the pooled PATH biomarker-adult interview data to 1) examine between-
subjects differences in biomarkers of exposure (BOEs) by nicotine concentration levels (e.g., zero, low, medium
and high), and 2) test interaction effects of nicotine levels and vaping products on BOEs from 5 classes of FDA
defined harmful and potentially harmful constituents (HPHC): nicotine metabolites, TSNAs, metals, PAHs, VOCs
and the BOE of health effects (e.g., oxidative stress) in urine and serum panels using weighted multivariable
regression models. In Aim 2, we will leverage the harmonized longitudinal Waves 1-6 PATH Adult Interview data
to prospectively examine associations of nicotine levels in ENDS and vaping devices with tobacco use behaviors
(e.g., subsequent abstinence from cigarette smoking or subsequent relapse to cigarette smoking) and nicotine
dependence. This study is innovative in its focus on the effects of e-liquid nicotine concentration levels and
vaping devices on population health (biomarkers), ENDS ↔ Cig use transitions and nicotine dependence by
leveraging the nationally longitudinal data. Such information has important implications for future tobacco
regulatory sciences at the population level and can guide FDA as to whether future Premarket Tobacco Product
Application (PMTA) submissions for higher nicotine products should be authorized.

SARS-CoV-2 has infected over 138 million people and resulted in over 2.8 million deaths so far, with the
expectation the pandemic will continue for many more months, and the virus will persist endemically for years,
exacerbated by emerging variants of concern (VoC). Although several vaccines are being used wide-spread, it
is unclear if they will be able to induce effective long-term immunity against emerging VoC. Highly effective anti-
viral therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2 remain elusive, although several monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the
Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the Spike (S) protein have been granted EUA for mild to moderate infection,
their effectiveness against severe disease has not yet been evident. With the slow pace of global vaccination,
limited anti-viral use/efficacy, and the emergence of antigenic drift variants, the trajectory of this pandemic and
future resurgences of the virus is of great concern. Fundamental understanding of the mechanisms of inducing
and sustaining protective humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 will be critical to its mitigation. The virus is now
classified into several clades, numerous VoC emerging, and indications including our work and others that some
of this antigenic drift is the result of the virus escaping from immune pressure and increased transmissibility. Drift
within the RBD is of the utmost concern as it can enhance the infectivity of the virus and negate the activity of
NAbs that may have developed from previous vaccination or infection. Numerous reports have emerged of
repeated SARS-CoV-2 infections in patients, and breakthrough infections in fully vaccinated individuals,
highlighting the imperfection of naturally acquired SARS-CoV-2 immunity. Utilizing our rationally designed
RBD/RBD-ACE2 fusion protein variants, we have identified epitopic and phenotypic heterogeneity amongst
RBD-specific human B cells and have isolated several potent RBD-specific human neutralizing monoclonal Abs
(NmAbs) (IC50<50 ng/ml) against SARS-CoV-2 which are entering into a Phase 1/2 clinical trial using inhaled
delivery in the coming months. We hypothesize that within RBD, the highly conserved regions (RBD-CR),
epitopes desirable for mediating broad and potent humoral protection, are surrounded by variable regions (RBD-
VR) that are structurally dynamic and highly susceptible to antigenic drift. Further, we hypothesize that RBD-VR
mitigate the development of potent and broad RBD-CR specific humoral responses through their
immunodominance and direct occlusion of RBD-CR. This RBD-CR/RBD-VR evolutionary dynamic is likely to
regulate the sustained protection (or failure) of humoral responses against future viral variants. We will 1) define
the ontological and phenotypic diversity of the human RBD-specific neutralizing antibody response, 2) define the
dynamics of maintenance of ACE2 binding and immunological pressure on constraining RBD evolution, and 3)
determine RBD Ab tolerance for and contribution to SARS-CoV-2 drift. Defining the limits of natural infection and
vaccination induced RBD neutralizing antibodies to drive antigenic drift and confer protection from divergent
SARS-CoV-2 viruses will inform the development next generation SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and therapeutics."
10908591,"Stem cell lineage commitment in response to biomaterial cues offer attractive alternative means for complex
tissue regeneration. The goal of this project is to design, develop, and evaluate a scaffold platform that can
instruct stem cells in a 3D micro-environment through material stiffness and bio-physical cues. We propose to
evaluate this scaffold technology to study osteochondral (OC) tissue development with an interface as a potential
solution to complex tissue repair, an unment clinical need. The OC tissue regeneration continues to be a major
clinical hurdle and despite many merits, current biological and tissue engineered grafts fail to provide successful
long-term clinical outcomes. Incomplete tissue regeneration, quality of newly formed cartilage
(fibrocartilage/hyaline), and lack of zonal structure formations lead to poor host tissue integration. The current
knowledge in tissue engineering elucidates the role of biomaterials and their cues in the form of surface
chemistry, topography, and matrix stiffness in regulating stem cell fate and lineage commitment in 2D cultures.
However, limited efforts have been made to incorporate material and structural cues in 3D-scaffolds to induce
stem cell lineage commitment. The primary objective of this proposal is to develop a scaffold platform with
imbued structural and material cues to drive mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) lineage commitment, differentiation,
and zonal structure formation to regenerate OC tissue. Our recent publications and unpublished work suggest
layered OC tissue formation within the scaffold structure by the cultured MSCs under controlled in vitro and in
vivo conditions. The current scaffold technology is innovative because it uses a single material to create pore
gradients in zonal configurations to avoid material compatibility issues and delamination. Additionally, the
literature lacks methodology to characterize a zonal tissue such as OC and scaffolds presented in this
application. We propose to develop and validate a heat map methodology as a new analytical tool to measure
material stiffness and validate quantitatively with histological findings of regenerated tissue from in vitro and in
vivo samples. We hypothesize that scaffold architecture imbued with varied matrix stiffness and growth factors
will promote implanted adult stem cell differentiation towards complete OC tissue regeneration with zonal
structure. The specific aims of this project are: Aim 1: Optimization of a 3D-scaffold platform embedded with
structural and physical cues for interface engineering. Aim 2: Elucidate biomaterial-cell interactions and the
mechanistic role of local matrix stiffness and structure in influencing MSC lineage commitment in vitro. Aim 3:
Assess the engineered scaffold system with bio-physical cues for OC interface formation in a rabbit model. The
outcomes of this project may lead to (i) development of an enabling scaffold technology to engineer stem cells,
and (ii) development of an OC test-bed scaffold platform that promotes zonal structure formation leading to host
tissue integration. The scaffold technology, tools, and methodologies developed through this project will be
applicable to build scaffold-driven regenerative strategies for interface engineering."

Sarina Sahetya, MD MHS is a pulmonary and critical care physician-scientist at Johns Hopkins University, with
a Master’s degree in Clinical Investigation. This K23 proposal will provide her valuable training towards her
long-term career goal of being an independent, NIH-funded, patient-oriented investigator conducting
randomized trials to improve clinical outcomes for patients with acute respiratory failure. Acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common and frequently fatal type of acute respiratory failure with an overall
mortality ~40%. Mechanical ventilation is a cornerstone of ARDS management. Despite its life-saving effect,
mechanical ventilation also can cause ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), which can increase morbidity and
mortality. Recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of optimal lung-protective
ventilation strategies to improve patient outcomes. Recent observational studies suggest that targeting low
Driving Pressure, as part of a mechanical ventilation approach for ARDS, could improve mortality. This K23
grant builds on Dr. Sahetya’s prior experience with developing physiologically-guided mechanical ventilation
approaches for reducing Driving Pressure. In this K23, she will prospectively evaluate a Driving Pressure-
guided approach to lung-protective ventilation. The research will be completed within the highly supportive
training environment at Johns Hopkins, with the guidance of a team of superb mentors with relevant expertise.
The overall objectives of this K23 Award are to: (1) complete rigorous multi-phase pilot work evaluating a lung-
protective ventilation strategy minimizing Driving Pressure for ARDS patients, and (2) develop essential skills
for the candidate to be a successful independent patient-oriented investigator. The career development plan
combines didactics, with outstanding mentorship in key areas of advanced statistical analysis, rigorous
protocol and trial design optimization via qualitative methods, and conduct of a pilot randomized trial, to ensure
a successful transition to independence. Using a large database of ARDS patients enrolled in a recent NHLBI-
funded trial, Dr. Sahetya will evaluate the relationship between changes in Driving Pressure, arising from
changes in positive end-expiratory pressure, and mortality as well as explore patient characteristics that modify
this relationship (Aim 1). She will use qualitative methods to gain in-depth understanding of clinicians’
perspectives on optimizing the design of ventilation RCTs in order to refine a proposed Driving Pressure-
guided pilot trial (Aim 2). Finally, she will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial evaluating the feasibility of
a Driving Pressure-guided ventilation strategy compared to the ARDS Network lung-protective ventilation
protocol (Aim 3). This rigorous training and mentored research experience will foster continued productivity,
provide preliminary data for a future NIH R-level grant, and establish a strong foundation for a career
conducting clinical trials of new interventions to improve patient outcomes in acute respiratory failure."

Bicycling is a leading cause of childhood injuries and, second to motor vehicles, bicycles contribute to more
childhood injuries than any other consumer product. Approaches to increasing bicycling safety among youth
include bicycle safety education programs and parents also play a vital role as influencers of their child's
bicycle handling and traffic safety skills, perceptions, and self-efficacy. Bicycle safety education programs are
abundant, but little is known about their effectiveness in terms of behavior change. This cluster randomized
controlled trial will evaluate a community-based bicycle safety education program with and without an in-
person parent training component. We will recruit 180 early adolescent bicyclists (ages 9 to 12) and a
parent/guardian from local neighborhood centers after school and summer programs, where we have
conducted preliminary studies. Randomization into the three study groups will occur at the site-level.
Adolescent bicycles in all study group sites will be equipped with Pedal Portal, an innovative bicycle-mounted
GPS/video system developed by our research team to objectively observe bicycling risk exposure and
behaviors while bicycling. System data will be coded to measure bicycling exposure (hours, miles traveled,
routes) and the types and rates of safety-relevant events (near crashes, crashes), and safety-relevant
behaviors (e.g., following traffic rules, scanning for traffic at intersections). This will be the first randomized trial
to use GPS and video technology to evaluate the effectiveness of a youth bicycle safety intervention in
changing behavior. The control group will not receive any bicycle safety education programming. Participants
in the first intervention group (Bike Club) will receive a 12-hour bicycle safety education program. Participants
in the second intervention group (Bike Club Plus) will receive an enhanced version of the 12-hour bicycle
safety education program which will include a parent training session on bicycling safety best practices, child
development as it relates to bicycling, strategies for practice at home, and feedback on their adolescent's
bicycling performance. Our main hypotheses are that adolescents who receive the bicycle safety intervention
will have increased safety behaviors (e.g., helmet use, hazard recognition), reduced errors (e.g., riding against
traffic, swerving/wobbling), and increased knowledge, perceptions, and self-efficacy compared to the control
group; and adolescents whose parent receives the parent training will have even greater improvements in
study outcomes than those whose parents do not receive the training. If successful, approaches from this
study could be widely implemented to improve adolescent bicycling safety."
10911130,"Structural characterization of Fab-dimerized glycan-reactive antibodies that neutralize HIV-1
 A glycan shield covers the HIV-1 envelope (Env) limiting antibody access to broadly neutralizing
antibody (bnAb) epitopes. 2G12 had for long been the only example of a HIV-1 bnAb that interacts solely with
the Env glycan shield. Its unique VH domain-swapped architecture, with two Fab arms swapped to create a
Fab-dimerized IgG, allows 2G12 to simultaneously interact with 4 glycans, thus bolstering typically weak
protein-glycan binding through avidity. We have recently characterized structurally diverse Fab-dimerized,
glycan-reactive (FDG) antibodies that target the HIV-1 Env glycan shield. Unlike 2G12, these newly identified
FDG antibodies are not domain-swapped; instead, Fab dimerization occurred by mechanisms including inter-
Fab disulfide linkage, hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions. We further showed that the HIV-1 Env-
targeting FDG antibodies recognized a glycan cluster in the S2 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike. While our
results reveal diverse ways antibodies can Fab dimerize to recognize glycans clusters, several questions
remain regarding the mechanisms of Fab dimerization and glycan recognition. Understanding these will
provide insights into the development of B cell responses to glycans.
 The overall goals of this study are to understand structural determinants of antibody Fab dimerization
leading to high affinity glycan recognition. That 2G12 and other FDG bnAbs specifically recognize a conserved
glycan cluster on HIV-1 Envs that consists of self-sugars in a unique non-self presentation provides basis for
immunological discrimination between glycans on host and invading pathogens. The scientific premise of this
grant is that defining structural mechanisms for glycan recognition by Fab dimerized antibodies will allow
specific targeting of diverse glycosylated pathogens. The innovations in this grant derive from (i) an expanded
repertoire of FDG antibodies, (ii) the demonstration that FDG antibodies are prevalent, (iii) the finding that
domain-swapped VH conformation is not necessary for HIV-1 neutralization."
10939175,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Retinal neovascularization impairs visual function and is a hallmark of several neovascular eye diseases,
including retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). Diabetic retinopathy
(DR) is the leading cause of vision-loss in working age adults, and ROP is the leading cause of preventable
blindness in children. Current treatments include intravitreal (IVT) injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) biologics. However, these therapeutics are often accompanied by high treatment burden and
resistance to therapy. Previous research indicates that VEGF alone is not sufficient for induction of
neovascularization, suggesting that multiple disease-relevant pathways may be targeted to increase
therapeutic response. Thus, there is a critical need to develop novel therapies that modulate multiple disease-
relevant pathways and circumvent the issues with IVT injections. Prior studies indicate that APE1/Ref-1, a
multifunctional protein with both endonuclease (APE1) and redox activity (Ref-1), regulates multiple
transcription factors that are linked to retinal neovascularization. Preliminary data in the laser-induced choroidal
neovascularization model demonstrated upregulation of Ref-1 during neovascularization, and oral
administration of a small molecule Ref-1 redox inhibitor decreased disease severity. RNA-seq of human retinal
endothelial cells revealed that a Ref-1 redox inhibitor downregulated Wnt signaling genes, implying that Ref-1
redox function modulates neovascularization through the Wnt signaling. But, the underlying molecular
mechanisms of the novel Ref-1 target in retinal neovascularization have yet to be elucidated. Identifying the
molecular mechanism underlying Ref-1 in retinal neovascularization is critical in developing novel therapies to
reduce vision loss. The hypothesis of this proposal is that Ref-1 redox activity promotes induction of retinal
neovascularization via activation of the Wnt signaling pathway, and reducing Ref-1 redox activity with a novel
Ref-1 redox inhibitor will exhibit potent therapeutic effects via inhibition of the Wnt signaling pathway. Aim 1 will
analyze the spatiotemporal expression of Ref-1 in retinal neovascularization in the oxygen-induced retinopathy
(OIR) mouse model, the Vldlr-/- mouse model, and in human PDR tissue. Aim 2 will analyze the mechanism of
Ref-1 regulation of the Wnt pathway in retinal endothelial cells through functional in vitro assays. Aim 3 will
assess anti-angiogenic effects of a Ref-1 inhibitor in vivo by administering oral Ref-1 inhibitor in the OIR mouse
model and evaluating changes in neovascularization. Effects on the Wnt signaling pathway will also be
assessed using immunofluorescence. Completion of this study will bolster understanding of Ref-1 in
neovascular eye diseases and provide a novel therapeutic strategy to combat vision loss and blindness due to
these diseases."

Cannabis has undergone widespread increases in recreational use and legalization in recent decades.
Cannabis use, particularly when it begins in adolescence, is associated with impairments in multiple domains
of cognition and mental health. Recently, genetic studies have found several variants associated with cannabis
use and cannabis use disorder, as well as several phenotypes that are genetically correlated with cannabis
use. However, it is unclear how genetic risk for cannabis use affects adolescent development and behavior,
particularly in the period before substance use begins.
In this project I plan to use advanced methods in statistical modeling to examine the effects of several
substance use genetic risk profiles on behavior. Aim 1 of this project will test the influence of a cannabis use
disorder genetic risk score, as well as several genetic risk scores known to be related to cannabis use, on
multiple domains of mental health and behavior in two large samples of substance-naïve adolescents (The
Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development Study [ABCD], and the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child
Cohort Study [MoBa]) totaling over 115,000 participants. By incorporating multiple related genetic risk scores in
univariate and multivariate statistical models, this project will be able to tease apart the unique and overlapping
effects of genetic risk for cannabis use disorder compared to other genetic risk profiles. Aim 2 will follow a
similar analysis technique, applied to restriction spectrum imaging measures in the brain, to understand the
influence of genetic risk for cannabis use on brain microstructure in substance-naïve adolescents from the
ABCD study. Finally, Aim 3 will incorporate genetic risk for cannabis use, childhood mental health measures,
and brain microstructure to predict age of onset of regular cannabis use. In line with the motivation of the
ABCD Study, this project will use pre-exposure data to aid in prediction of substance use behavior during
adolescence.
The proposed research project will leverage existing population-based longitudinal datasets to tease apart the
interplay between genetic variation, brain development, and behavior. The addition of several related genetic
risk scores to our statistical models will allow us to understand the shared genetic variants that contribute to
brain structure and behavior. Importantly, the examination of development both before and after the initiation of
cannabis use will be instrumental in understanding the relationship between cannabis use and development,
and will allow us to distinguish effects that follow from cannabis use versus those that may predispose
adolescents to begin using."

Despite global efforts to curtail emerging and reemerging pathogens, rationale vaccine design has failed to
overcome devastating intractable diseases such as malaria, HIV, and tuberculosis. Memory T cells established
after natural infection or vaccination contribute to protection against reinfection. Therefore, manipulating
vaccine-elicited T cell immunosurveillance may provide protection against intracellular pathogens and might
offer a strategy to bolster humoral-mediated vaccines. However, deep understanding of memory CD8 T cell
migration will be critical to exploit T cells for next generation vaccine designs. For sixty years, we have
understood that lymphocytes recirculate through blood and secondary lymphoid organs (SLO). However,
memory T cells parked in the stromal and parenchymal compartments of barrier tissues, known as resident
memory T cells (TRM), dominate nonlymphoid tissue (NLT) surveillance and contrast this paradigm. Although
central memory T cells (TCM) migrate through blood and lymph, we and others have recently shown that SLO
are also patrolled by nonrecirculating TRM ( SLO TRM), which may constitute a major reassessment of LN
immunosurveillance. SLO TRM, are broadly distributed following systemic infections and may contribute a
substantial fraction to the memory T cell pool in human LNs, but the roles of SLO TRM in immunity are
unknown. Owing to their distinct migration properties, I hypothesize that SLO TRM play specialized roles in
anamnestic immune responses compared to recirculating memory populations. Aim 1 will rigorously address
the abundance and microanatomical localization of SLO TRM after diverse pathogen experiences and identify
markers that reliably denote LN residence in ‘dirty’ mice. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that SLO TRM are
poised to migrate to their upstream NLT upon reactivation. And, Aim 3 will address the protective functions of
SLO TRM upon reinfection. With implications for vaccine design and assessment, these studies will constitute
some of the first investigations into SLO TRM biology. Most importantly, this proposal will serve as an ideal
medium for predoctoral training. I will execute this fellowship at the University of Minnesota in the laboratory of
David Masopust, Ph.D., a world-leader in the study of memory T cell immunosurveillance. With the combined
support of the University’s Center for Immunology, the Microbiology, Immunology, and Cancer Biology Ph.D.
program, and Dr. Masopust, I will receive personalized training to facilitate an efficient transition to the next
stage of my research career. My long-term career goal is to obtain a faculty position at an academic research
institution and direct innovative basic science with an emphasis in immunology."
10917183,"The widespread use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigs) by youth is a significant public health problem in the US and
many parts of the world. To date, the long-term health effects of e-cig use in this vulnerable population are largely
unknown. Many toxicants and carcinogens present in e-cig vapor exert their biological effects through epigenetic
changes that can cause dysregulation of disease-related genes. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are key
epigenetic regulators of gene expression in health and disease states.
Approach: To investigate lncRNA-mediated gene regulation and its association with disease development in
youth vapers, we will perform RNA-seq and network-based analyses on cells and tissues of youth e-cig users
as compared to non-users. Aim 1a: Using a systems biology approach, we will detect aberrant lncRNAs and
their interaction networks that drive gene dysregulation in youth e-cig users. The detected lncRNAs that govern
gene dysregulation in youth e-cig users can serve as novel biomarkers of exposure and effects for vaping. Aim
1b: Applying advanced prediction methods, we will identify which diseases are associated with the aberrant
lncRNAs detected in youth e-cig users. Aberrant lncRNAs in youth e-cig users that are associated with specific
diseases can be used for risk assessment of vaping. Aim 2: Using computational modeling, we will find the
associations between aberrant lncRNAs and the intensity and duration of vaping (i.e., dose) and the
characteristics of vaping products used by youth. Identifying product characteristics that influence the lncRNA-
mediated gene dysregulation in youth e-cig users can inform the FDA’s regulation of tobacco products to protect
youth and promote public health.
Responsiveness to RFA-OD-21-004: This proposal will maximize the use of existing biospecimens from our
recently completed NIDCR-funded project whose study subjects were recruited through collaboration with USC-
TCORS, which is sponsored by the FDA|CTP. This is a unique collection of biospecimens from a representative
sample of population in Southern California. No publicly available repository in the US offers similar specimens
needed for this proposal. We will generate scientific evidence on the health risks of e-cig use in youth, thus
informing the FDA’s regulation of tobacco products to protect this vulnerable population and promote public
health. We will use an innovative approach to address two scientific interest areas in this RFA, including
assessment of (1) exposure; and (2) potential harm from vaping in youth, who are a population of special
relevance. By elucidating the molecular changes that underlie the biological consequences of e-cig use in youth,
we will develop novel biomarkers of exposure and effects. These biomarkers will have significant utility for
assessing the health risks of e-cig use in this vulnerable population. By determining how vaping dose and product
characteristics can modulate the induced biological effects in youth e-cig users, we will provide urgently needed
data to inform the FDA’s regulation of tobacco products to protect youth and promote public health."

Action potential propagation through nodes of Ranvier is central to nervous system function. Understanding this
process is essential for developing improved treatments for nodal pathologies of electrical signaling including
multiple sclerosis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, stroke, spinal injury, and glaucoma. Saltatory conduction—the
jumping of the action potential from one node to the next—has been described since its discovery as a purely
electrical phenomenon. This proposal aims to investigate whether it is also fundamentally mechanical in nature.
The mechano-activated two-pore domain potassium channel TRAAK is exclusively expressed at nodes of
Ranvier. TRAAK is insensitive to voltage, but acutely tuned to membrane tension, with cell swelling increasing
TRAAK-mediated potassium currents up to one hundred-fold. Still, whether mechanical activation of TRAAK is
relevant to spike propagation is unknown. Using a combination of organic chemistry, molecular biophysics, and
neurophysiology, this proposal will examine how mechanically activated TRAAK currents contribute to action
potential propagation, speed, and reliability. To selectively control TRAAK channels, photoswitchable tethered
ligands (PTLs) will be designed, synthesized, and optimized for maximal spatiotemporally precise block of
TRAAK current. Screening of PTL tethering sites in leak and mechano-activated open TRAAK channels will
enable the identification of state-specific PTL·Cys-TRAAK pairs and the precise modulation of basal and/or
mechano-activated TRAAK currents. Using these tools, TRAAK's contributions to action potential propagation
will be characterized in myelinated optic nerve under typical conditions and in response to mechanical
perturbation. These experiments will both elucidate the role of TRAAK in spike propagation and, potentially,
demonstrate that mechanical force is central to node repolarization, with broad implications for the treatment of
nodal pathologies and the field of neuronal communication as a whole."

Unexpected cardiovascular activity plays a substantial role in therapeutic program failure leading to major loss
of patient life and research time. Therefore, it is imperative that steps be taken to understand and predict drug
cardiovascular activity. As the age of personalized medicine advances, the use of Gene Expression Signatures
(GES) has emerged as a new tool to describe biological processes. These GES consist of the quantitative levels
of mRNA expressed in a biological system as a result of a perturbation; however, they lack information about
underlying protein structure and function. It has been shown that Structural Gene Expression Signatures
(sGES), which integrate protein structure information derived from GES, produce reliable signatures that
capture cellular responses to perturbagens such as drugs. Specifically, preliminary results demonstrate how
these sGES capture underlying patterns that link compound structure with cardioactivity in cardyomyocites.
This preliminary data, combining computational and experimental work, was made possible by the outstanding
environment of scientific inquiry nurtured through the long-standing collaboration between this proposal's
sponsor and co-sponsor. The goal of this training is to hone skills that bridge the divide between informatics,
bench top experiments, and human health as well as develop fluency in scientific thinking that can be applied
to a future career as a physician scientist. The mentorship of this proposal's sponsors, the opportunities at
ISMMS to learn from diverse collaborations and experiences, as well as the scientific plan outlined in this
proposal all contribute to the strength of this training plan to achieve this goal. Specifically, this project will
expand the sGES tool through the addition of multiple features derived from structure and function, such as
secondary structure and protein disorder, and apply the resulting signatures to cardiovascular activity
understanding as well as prediction. The final sGES tool will be made publically available on a web server,
which has already been constructed. Next, profiles will be generated for compounds based on their signature,
structure, and recorded cardiovascular activity in the FDALabel database. The use of these profiles will be two
fold. The first will be as training data for an ensemble learning algorithm, which will predict drug structure
from signature and therefore provide a valuable first step toward generating de novo compounds from disease
signatures. The second use of these profiles will be to create a map linking chemical structure to cardiovascular
activity. The predicted cardiovascular activities from these computational aims will be experimentally validated
with cell based cardiotoxicity assays such as the hERG assay, which is a commonly used as a first line screen for
cardiovascular toxicity. Ultimately, the completion of this project will result in the development of useful,
validated, publically available tools for understanding as well as predicting cardiovascular activity and prepare
the investigator to conduct scientific research as a physician scientist."
10896262,"This proposal aims to investigate the assembly mechanisms, structures, and functions of polymeric (p)
immunoglobulins (Ig) that populate the mucosa. The pIgs are found in vertebrates and together form a structurally
diverse group of antibodies. They comprise several Ig heavy chain classes, including mammalian IgA and IgM,
which typically contain between two and five Ig monomers and one joining chain (JC); however, potential to
assemble with the JC and/or to assemble into polymers of different size varies with vertebrate species and Ig
heavy chain class. Following assembly, pIgs are transported to the mucosa by the polymeric Ig receptor (pIgR).
In the mucosa, the pIgR ectodomain, called secretory component (SC), remains bound and the complex is
referred to as a secretory (S) Ig. SIgA is the predominant mucosal antibody in mammals; it is typically found in
dimeric (d) forms; however higher order polymers such as tetramers are functionally relevant. SIgA is associated
with unique effector functions compared to monomeric, circulatory antibodies; it can coat, cross-link and
agglutinate commensal and pathogenic antigens and also mediate interactions with receptors on host and
microbial cells. Despite significance, the structural basis for pIg assembly and SIg functions remained poorly
understood through decades of immunological research. In 2020 the cryo-electron microscopy structures of
SIgM, SIgA and a dimeric (d) IgA precursor were published revealing unprecedented molecular insights into
these crucial complexes and opening the door to new questions and structure-guided experiments. The
structures of dIgA and dimeric forms of SIgA revealed two IgAs joined through the JC to form a pseudosymmetric,
bent conformation that appears to restrict the positions of antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) and promote access
to receptor-binding sites. The SC is asymmetrically bound to one side and is solvent accessible, suggesting it
may promote yet uncharacterized interactions with host or microbial factors. These observations raise the
questions of how structural differences among pIg are generated (e.g dimer versus tetramer and JC versus no
JC), how the bent, asymmetric arrangement of components is induced and maintained, and how it contributes
to function. The proposed research program will use structural and biophysical approaches to target these
questions. Aim 1 will identify Ig heavy chain residues, structural motifs and/or conformational changes that
promote pIg assembly and control pIg polymeric state, while also determining the structural basis for JC-
independent pIg assembly and function. Aim 2 will characterize JC-specific mechanisms of pIg assembly and
its structural contributions to the pseudosymmetric conformation of dIgA. Aim 3 will characterize the functional
significance SC and its capacity to bind microbial ligands. These studies will deliver comprehensive mechanistic
models for pIg assembly, generate new pIg structures and report new SIg structure-function relationships. This
outcome will improve knowledge of mucosal immunity and provide a foundation for engineering pIg and SIg in
order to explore their normal functions and therapeutic potential."
10909167,"Abstract:
The CNS performs extremely complex computations with remarkable efficiency. This is exemplified by the
ability to seamlessly execute motor behaviors that necessitate the coordination of multiple muscle groups
controlling joints with many degrees of freedom. It is thought that one strategy to simplify motor computations
is to adopt a circuit organization that links combinations of motor pools into functional units called “synergies”
or “primitives”. Thus, the circuit elements that underlie motor synergies are thought to represent the basic
building blocks for orchestrating the neural control of routine motor behaviors. Elegant stimulation and recording
experiments from labs working with amphibians, rodents, and primates have found evidence for motor synergy
circuits within the spinal cord. The major questions addressed in this grant are: (a) what is the underlying
cellular and connectivity organization of lumbar spinal motor synergy circuits, (b) what neuronal subtypes
comprise these circuits, and (c) what intrinsic and extrinsic factors shape the formation of these circuits?
 The laboratory has used trans-synaptic neuronal tracing, optogenetics, and molecular screens to identify a
heterogenous (Satb1+, Satb2+, Tcfap2b+, Tcf4+) population of interconnected excitatory and inhibitory pre-
motor interneurons within lamina V of the lumbar spinal cord. Based on their properties these lamina V cells
are generically referred to as motor synergy encoders (MSE). The hypothesize is that the MSE cell network
comprises a major computational node for motor control within the spinal cord. These cells receive inputs from
the cortex and sensory neurons such as those that relay proprioceptive information. Thus, MSE neurons are
well positioned to mediate coordinated muscle activation patterns arising from command centers for volitional
movement as well as reflex pathways activated by sensory feedback locally within the spinal cord.
 The aims of this grant are designed to unravel the wiring and cellular constituents within motor synergy
circuits, and to examine how these circuits form during embryonic development and early postnatal life. Aim 1
will create a cellular atlas and connectivity map of MSE neurons. This will define whether the molecular
heterogeneity of MSE neurons corresponds to separate motor pool circuit-modules or physiologically-different
classes of neurons used for controlling all motor pools. Aim 2 will define the pattern of propriospinal feedback
from muscles onto MSE neurons. Here the goal is to establish whether the MSE circuit is based on simple
labeled line pathways or has a more complex input-output relationship. Aim 3 will use transcription factor
knockouts to determine whether hardwired intrinsic genetic programs establish the MSE circuitry. Aim 4 will
test whether the functional MSE network arises from activity dependent feedback from proprioceptive sensory
neurons. Taken together, these aims will provide a detailed molecular-cellular understanding of a critical node
within the local spinal system for computing and coordinating motor activation patterns. These findings may
help target motor circuits using genetics and/or neural activity to facilitate recovery from spinal cord injury."
10909947,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia, affecting approximately 35 million people worldwide.
During AF, the heart's two upper chambers (the atria) beat weakly and irregularly creating regions of slow flow
(blood stasis) where clots may form. Clots preferentially form within the left atrial appendage (LAA) and can
travel to the brain resulting in stroke. The risk of embolic strokes in AF patients is reduced with anticoagulation
medications but, due to the associated increased bleeding risk, these medications are not recommended for all
AF patients. Determining if anticoagulation is beneficial requires assessing if patients' risk of stroke outweighs
the bleeding risk. However, current methods to risk-stratify AF patients for stroke are not personalized and, for
a large number of patients, leave uncertainty as to whether anticoagulation is beneficial. The main objective of
this project is to develop novel CT imaging analyses to quantify the personalized risk of LAA thrombosis
in AF patients. Our scientific premise is that blood stasis is a key ingredient of thrombosis because it permits
thrombogenic reactive species to interact and initiate clot formation. Our preliminary data suggest the spatio-
temporal dynamics of blood flow and wall motion in the atrium and LAA strongly correlate with thrombus
formation. Our approach consists of three specific aims. In Aim 1 we will develop and validate a computational
framework to quantify left atrial blood stasis by 4D CT imaging of atrial kinetics combined with computational
fluid dynamics (CFD). We will develop image processing algorithms to quantify left atrial kinetics based on time-
resolved CT scans, including the spatio-temporal dynamics of contrast opacification, imaged wall motion, and
the non-Newtonian rheology of blood flow in the LAA. In Aim 2 we will establish the relationship between 4D
atrial kinetics by multi-heartbeat contrast CT and blood stasis using CFD, in order to facilitate the clinical
translation of stasis mapping by CT alone. We will also perform the first rigorous analysis of how uncertainty
caused by imaging resolution, modeling assumptions, and physiological variability propagates into predictions
of LAA blood stasis. In Aim 3 we will perform an outcome-based clinical pilot study to develop a personalized
image-based thrombosis risk score. We will acquire CT data in patients with a history of LAA thrombus or AF-
associated stroke and a matched comparison group of AF patients with no history of thrombosis. We will use
this unique data set to develop a patient-specific image-based risk score incorporating CT contrast opacification
analyses with functional and geometric parameters. Our team includes a cardiologist with a physics background
specializing in imaging, an engineer with expertise in CFD analysis, and an engineer with expertise in quantitative
analyses of cardiac imaging. Our translational goal is to provide clinicians with a novel image-based tool
for personalized risk stratification of patients with atrial fibrillation to guide anticoagulation decisions
and improve outcomes."

The Wnt pathway is frequently dysregulated in many cancers, underscoring it as a therapeutic
target. Although Wnt inhibitors appear promising in many preclinical studies, they have failed
uniformly in clinical trials. Molecular mechanisms of resistance are poorly defined. Further
dissection of the precise mechanisms of WNT pathway activation in specific tumor types is
needed to develop new WNT pathway inhibitors with less toxicity. The axonal guidance program
Sema3C/PlxnD1 promotes the self-renewal and tumorigenicity of glioma stem-like cells (GSCs),
but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Our data now suggest that Sema3C/PlxnD1 signaling
functions as an alternative activator of canonical Wnt signaling. Importantly, Sema3C-driven Wnt
signaling occurred despite suppression of Wnt ligand secretion, suggesting that Sema3C may
drive canonical Wnt signaling independent of Wnt binding to its receptors. As Sema3C/PlxnD1
signaling is used in over 85% of GBM, it may represent an important mechanism of resistance to
upstream Wnt pathway inhibitors. Our data support that Sema3C/PlxnD1 signaling regulates two
critical aspects Wnt signaling: beta-catenin stability and nuclear translocation. In this proposal,
we aim to identify molecular mechanisms by which Sema3C/PlxnD1 regulate canonical Wnt
signaling. Additionally, we aim to assess the therapeutic impact of targeting Sema3C signaling to
improve sensitivity to upstream Wnt inhibitors in mouse models of GBM. These studies will
provide a novel therapeutic strategy to achieve clinically significant Wnt pathway inhibition in
GSCs potentially without the toxicity of currently available WNT inhibitors. These studies may be
applied to other cancers including breast and prostate cancers that utilize both Sema3C and Wnt
signaling."

As the demand for medicinal plant products increases, so does the possibility of adulteration. Authentication of
botanicals is complicated due to the immense quantity of molecular markers, including genetic loci and small
molecules, within plant systems. This complexity also hinders identification of bioactive compounds responsible
for the desired medicinal outputs. However, the improved accessibility of advanced statistical processing allows
harnessing of these species-specific markers for sample identification and biomarker discovery. The overall
hypothesis of this study is that multivariate and machine learning models will streamline multifaceted
natural product investigations. Aim 1 applies multivariate statistics to genetic barcoding and high-resolution
metabolomics data to develop authentication schemes, with Ocimum spp. (basil) as a model system. Random
Forest and Partial Least Squares models are built using greenhouse grown, authenticated basil plants and used
to predict the identity of consumer available products. Aim 2 uses the same statistical approaches to identify
compounds responsible for both basil’s cytotoxic and antimicrobial properties. Developed models will also be
used to predict dual-action bioactivity status of unknown samples. Models with the combined ability to identify
bioactive compounds and samples will be recommended for future studies to improve compound discovery and
classification of bioactive plants. The collection of data, development of statistical models, and professional
development activities described herein will result in the development of a well-rounded, independent

The overall objective of this proposal is to answer two fundamental questions on DNA
metabolism: 1) how DNA replication progresses timely and efficiently at hard-to-replicate sites;
and 2) how the large nucleoprotein complexes that comprise telomeres, the end of linear
chromosomes, are assembled and regulated. The first question emerges from our ongoing
mechanistic studies on the conserved Pif1-family of helicases. Our work highlights the
fundamental role that these helicases have in facilitating DNA replication at both secondary
DNA structures and protein barriers. Going forward, we seek to address the following: what
mechanisms couple the helicase activity to DNA synthesis by polymerases; how this synergy
leads to removal of obstacles imparted by protein barriers encountered in the nucleus or in
mitochondria; whether removal of obstacles is a general property of this class of helicases. The
second question is novel and is based on our recent finding of new properties of both yeast and
human telomere DNA binding proteins; namely, the ability of these proteins to interact with
telomeric DNA repeats in alternative modes and to facilitate DNA condensation. Our goal is to
test whether these properties play a role in establishing telomere length discrimination and
accessibility. We tackle these problems by using biochemically reconstituted systems and
employing a multipronged approach that integrates ensemble biochemical and biophysical
techniques with single-molecule methods, thus providing unparalleled access to the behavior of
individual molecules."

The gut-brain axis, and in particular brain-stomach communication, are implicated in emotional and cognitive processing and often linked to many nervous system disorders, including psychosocial dysfunction, substance abuse, neurological diseases, and degeneration. While a large body of work exists on stomach-brain vagal pathways, much less is known about how the brain and the stomach may communicate through the spinal sensory pathways. This R01 application proposes to determine the anatomy, function, and circuitry targeted by gut-innervating spinal sensory ganglia. The proposed studies will test the overarching hypothesis that, similarly to musculoskeletal proprioception, gastrointestinal (GI) mechanical stimuli are signaled to the brain, specifically the lateral reticular nucleus (LRN), via shared spinal sensory pathways. In addition, the proposal will determine the functional impact of the gastric-spinal-brain pathways on brain functions including reward behaviors and brain circuitries including the parietal, insular, and orbitofrontal cortices. To address our aims, state-of-the-art methodology will be used including organ-specific targeting by combinatorial viral injection, optogenetics including optically guided, in vivo electrophysiology in awake mice, computer-operated intraluminal balloon distension, and whole-brain c-Fos maps using light-sheet microscopy. Our studies may reveal novel peripheral therapeutical targets for emotional and psychosocial disorders associated with abnormal gut-brain communication. Moreover, the neural circuitries to be described in our studies may also be targeted to alleviate abnormal psychological states, including the nausea, anorexia, and chronic fatigue typical of GI motility disorders."

Aging is the greatest risk factor to α-synucleinopathy, a group of neurodegenerative diseases with severe cognitive impairmentand progressive motor dysfunction and dementia, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD) and half of Alzheimer's disease patients (AD). Dementia is a common symptom in α-synucleinopathies: DLB is the 2nd most common dementia after Alzheimer's disease (AD) accounting for 30% of dementia cases; Around 30% of AD cases also suffer from α-synucleinopathy resulting in a more rapid and severe cognition decline than AD alone. PD is the 2nd most common neurodegenerative disease, and greater than 50% of PD cases develop PDD. In addition to cognitive and memory dysfunctions, patients with dementia also suffer from anxiety, depression and mood swings. Although α-syn pathology is highly associated with dementia, the underlying aging-related mechanism driving the pathogenesis and contributing to their progression is not known and there is no available disease modifying therapy yet. Based on substantial postmortem analysis, Braak et al. demonstrated that α-syn pathology spreads in a stereotyped fashion from the vagus to the brain, which may initiate in the gastrointestinal tract. Particularly, nearly all the DLB and PDD cases present with α-syn pathology in the gut. Both clinical and experimental observations support that pathogenic α-syn spreading is a master trigger that drives α-synucleinopathy. In our gut-brain α-synucleinopathy (GBAS) mouse model, gut-injection of pathogenic α-synuclein (α-syn) can recapitulate α-syn pathology gut-brain spreading and cognitive impairment. In our preliminary studies, heterochronic blood exchange (HBE) from young mice inhibited pathogenic α-syn transmission and neuroinflammation in aged mice, suggesting an HBE-transferred phenotype that may effectively inhibit α-synucleinopathy. We identified lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG3)1, a major receptor of pathologic α-syn transmission. To identify the mechanism underlying rejuvenation and accelerated aging event, we further identified two novel LAG3-related and aging-regulating proteins that can mediate pathogenic α-syn transmission. Our studies support the feasibility to modulate plasma levels of FGL1 and sLAG3 in aged mice by the HBE approach. To determine the underlying mechanism if FGL1 and sLAG3 in the plasma are molecular mediators essential for the inhibitory effects of HBE on α-synucleinopathy an d related cognitive impairment, we have established a rigorous and robust experimental system combining the HBE approach, the GBAS model, genetically engineered mice without these factors, and recombinant FGL1 and sLAG3 proteins, for comprehensive gain- and loss-of-function analysis. Our Central Hypothesis is to identify the underlying mechanism that HBE inhibits α-synucleinopathy and related cognitive impairment through FGL1 and sLAG3. FGL1 functions as a rejuvenation factor to inhibit pathologic α-syn spreading in the gut-brain axis and alleviate consequent neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation, and cognitive impairment. sLAG3 acts as an age-acceleration factor contributing to the pathogenesis and with antagonistic function to FGL1. Strikingly, human postmortem evidence shows that α-syn pathology is observed first in the gastrointestinal system and then spreads to the brain in a stereotyped fashion. Recently, our collaborator Dr. Dawson developed a novel Gut-Brain α-synucleinopathy (GBAS) model, a sporadic α-synucleinopathy model recapitulating pathologic α-syn spreading among multiple organs and brain regions in patients. However, it remains largely unknown how aging-associated blood-borne components modulate α-synucleinopathy. As the foundation of this project, we identified lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG3), a major receptor of pathologic α-syn transmission. Our preliminary results showed that heterochronic blood exchange (HBE) from young mice can inhibit pathologic α-syn transmission to cells and inflammation in aged mice. We further identified two blood-borne aging-modulated proteins that regulate LAG3-mediated pathologic α-syn transmission. The first plasma protein fibrinogen-like protein (FGL1) as the major inhibitory ligand of LAG3, is decreased by aging and inhibits α-syn transmission. The second plasma protein sLAG3 is the soluble form of LAG3 protein, and it is increased by aging and promotes α-syn transmission. Our studies also support the feasibility to use HBE approach to modulate plasma levels of FGL1 and sLAG3 in aged mice by young blood. 
Our Central Hypothesis is that HBE with young blood inhibits α-synucleinopathy through two aging-associated circulatory proteins (FGL1 and sLAG3) essential for LAG3-mediated pathologic α-syn transmission. FGL1 functions as a rejuvenation factor to inhibit pathologic α-syn spreading in the gut-brain axis and consequent neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation, and behavioral deficits associated α-synucleinopathy. sLAG3 acts as an age-acceleration factor with antagonistic functions to FGL1. In specific aim 1, we propose to determine if HBE ameliorates α-synucleinopathy and related cognitive impairment by increasing aging-reduced FGL1 to inhibit pathological α-syn spreading. In specific aim 2, we propose to determine if HBE ameliorates α-synucleinopathy and related cognitive impairment by decreasing aging-induced sLAG3 to inhibit pathological α-syn spreading. Modulating plasma factors is a novel strategy to inhibit pathologic α-syn spreading and treating α-synucleinopathy and dementia. Positive results from this study will justify the development of novel α-synucleinopathy therapies based on plasma factor modulation. Novel molecular insights from this project will lay a solid foundation for the optimization and clinical translation of α-synucleinopathy therapies based on FGL1 and sLAG3 modulation."

Early onset colorectal cancer (EO-CRC), defined as disease onset in individuals younger than 50 years, is an
emerging, deadly public health threat in the United States. Because the colon contains a densely populated
microbial ecosystem, it is hypothesized that the intimate association of colonic epithelial cells with the microbiota
can contribute to the initiation and/or progression of human CRC. However, as yet, no studies investigating the
microbiota/microbiome of patients with EO-CRC have been reported. Our group has identified that colon mucus-
invasive bacterial biofilms are common on CRCs occurring in those older than 50 (termed late onset CRC, LO-
CRC). We have demonstrated that LO-CRC-associated bacterial biofilms induce colon tumors in susceptible
mouse models. Further, our preliminary data now support that biofilms are common on EO-CRC. Herein, we will
test the hypothesis that individuals with EO-CRC display microbial and colonic epithelial signatures that differ
from age-matched controls. In our distinct, but complementary, Specific Aims, we will trace the epidemiology of
biofilm formation on CRCs for the past 35 years, test the antibody responses of EO-CRC patients and comparator
disease and control groups to biofilm and other microbes and determine if microbial exposures induce changes
in colon epithelial biology that lower the threshold for colon epithelial cell neoplastic transformation. Using
retrospective and prospective human cohorts, our Specific Aims are: 1) to determine the longitudinal association
of biofilm structure and composition with EO-CRC defined by all bacterial and multiprobe fluorescent in situ
hybridization (FISH) and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing; 2) to characterize the binding of serum antibodies of
EO-CRC patients to a broad array of environmental organism-associated antigens (e.g., viral, phage, biofilm
bacterial and/or bacterial toxin) via programmable phage display-based profiling (known as PhIP-Seq); and 3) to
define the molecular signatures of normal EO-CRC epithelium with known biofilm status through genome-wide
methylation studies and the environmental stress responses of normal human colonoids derived from EO-CRC,
LO-CRC and healthy persons. Our results will provide insight into the microbial associations and colon epithelial
cell mechanisms that we predict potentiate EO-CRC, with the ultimate goal of informing and accelerating novel
strategies for EO-CRC detection, prevention and intervention."

10910868,"PROJECT SUMMARY_CORE A
Recovery from viral pneumonia is a clinically important yet understudied process. Severe viral pneumonia due
to influenza A virus (IAV) or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiologic agent
of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), damages the lower respiratory tract to cause acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS). While acute hypoxemic respiratory failure is a defining clinical feature in patients with ARDS,
advances in supportive care allow most patients to survive the hypoxemic phase of their illness. As a result, the
vast majority of patients with ARDS die from multiple organ dysfunction, including persistent respiratory failure,
days to weeks after the initial infection. Other than avoidance of additional lung injury, via low tidal volume
ventilation and a handful of other supportive therapies, there are no specific therapies for patients with viral
pneumonia/ARDS. A central hypothesis of this PPG is that the persistence of respiratory failure and the
development of multiple organ dysfunction in patients with ARDS is a consequence of the failure of normal
mechanisms of inflammation resolution and lung tissue repair. This hypothesis is clinically supported by a recent
analysis of patients enrolled in the ARDSnet where a “hyperinflammatory” endotype of ARDS patients was
associated with poor clinical outcomes, including death. We propose to investigate the process of recovery
from viral pneumonia with a focus on mechanisms that promote resolution of lung inflammation and
healthy repair of lung damage. Core A will assist the PPG investigators as they test this central hypothesis of
this PPG through a highly integrated and innovative set of experiments by focusing on five Specific Aims:
Specific Aim 1. To support communication between the Project Investigators, the Core Leaders, Collaborating
investigators, and the Internal and External Advisory Committee members.
Specific Aim 2. To provide a structure for the sharing of materials and dissemination of information between the

Specific Aim 3. To provide financial and regulatory oversight to the Project and Core Leaders and coordinate
their interactions with Institutional Core Services.

Intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs) cause immense suffering and affect almost 3% of the U.S.
population. Nearly 1,000 IDD-associated genes have been identified, but this is far too many to study individually
and develop custom therapies for each. An alternative approach is to divide IDD-associated genes into
subgroups based on shared pathways or convergent mechanisms, an idea I will test in this proposal by studying
chromatin modifiers, which account for nearly 20% of IDD-associated genes. Specifically, I will focus on the
COMPASS (Complex of Proteins Associated with SET1) family of methyltransferases, the largest group of
chromatin remodelers involved in IDD. Humans have six COMPASS complexes, all of which methylate H3K4, a
histone modification associated with active transcription. Haploinsufficiency of any of the core DNA-binding
proteins of these COMPASS complexes—SETD1A, SETD1B, KMT2A, KMT2B, KMT2C, and KMT2D—causes
IDD. Identifying convergent mechanisms across many genes requires a system that enables high-throughput
genetic perturbations and mitigates confounding variables. I will thus use human iPSC-derived neurons
(iNeurons) as a homogeneous system to model haploinsufficiency via CRISPR interference (CRISPRi). In Aim
1, I will determine transcriptomic changes caused by COMPASS methyltransferase haploinsufficiency in human
iNeurons. I will test whether there is a significant overlap between dysregulated genes and pathways across the
six COMPASS gene knockdowns. In Aim 2, I will use CUT&RUN to identify epigenetic perturbations in each
methyltransferase haploinsufficiency model. In Aim 3, I will characterize the effects of COMPASS
methyltransferase haploinsufficiency on neuronal morphology and electrophysiology. I will then perform a small-
molecule screen to determine if histone demethylase inhibitors can rescue any of these phenotypes through
rebalancing H3K4 methylation. These experiments will elucidate the pathobiology of COMPASS-related IDDs,
identify pathways for therapeutic intervention, and establish cellular disease models for testing candidate
therapies. Although this proposal focuses on six genes, it will also establish a broad framework for studying the
convergence of hundreds of other IDD risk genes, which would accelerate the discovery of viable therapeutic
approaches for some of the world’s most disabled patients."

Cūrza is developing the CZ-02 platform of broad-spectrum antibiotics as a new class focusing on multidrug-
resistant (MDR) Gram-negative pathogens that will also be efficacious against Gram-positive bacteria. CZ-02
antibacterials bind to a unique site on the bacterial ribosome that is not targeted by antibiotics available clinically
which is expected to limit cross-resistance to other antibiotics.
The initiation and subsequent development of the CZ-02 program represents a strong example for revisiting the
use of natural products in drug discovery which has fallen out of favor in Pharma. CZ-02s were inspired by the
natural product amicetin which selectively inhibits bacterial protein synthesis but suffers from limited antibacterial
activity and poor drug-like properties. Careful engineering of the natural product has produced CZ-02s with
exquisite selectivity for bacterial protein synthesis, potent antibacterial activity and excellent drug-like properties
that have demonstrated efficacy against MDR pathogens in multiple animal models of infection while sparing
mammalian cells from cytotoxicity.
The goal of this Direct-to-Phase II project is to develop a new antibacterial drug candidate that covers Gram-
negative pathogens found among Enterobacterales and the non-fermenters Acinetobacter baumanni and
Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well as Gram-positive pathogens. The initial clinical indication will be for treating
Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs), with other indications to follow (e.g. complicated intra-abdominal infections,
pneumonia, bacteremia). At the conclusion of this Phase II SBIR will be a pre-clinical development candidate
that is potent with broad spectrum activity that will be ready for Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC)
and toxicology/safety pharmacology under Good Laboratory Practices (GLP).
Advancement of this antibacterial lead series will be accomplished by the following aims. Aim 1 will expand the
spectrum of activity for advanced leads that have shown efficacy in UTI animal models with MDR Gram-negative
pathogens. Curza’s proprietary model for producing potent and selective inhibitors of bacterial P-site protein
synthesis, in combination with a battery of biological/biochemical activity assays (biochemical, microbiological,
in vitro ADME-Tox), will be used for chemistry efforts to ensure compounds retain activity while expanding the
spectrum of addressable pathogens to include A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa. Aim 2 will define
pharmacokinetics (PK) while identifying the maximum tolerated dose and confirming efficacy by testing in thigh
infection models to select CZ-02s for evaluation in UTI models. A lead and backup drug candidate will be selected
in Aim 3 by evaluation in UTI models of antibiotic-resistant bacteria followed by non-GLP toxicology in rats to
nominate a lead and backup. Aim 4 will scale-up production (non-GLP) to support in vivo studies while Aim 5 will
establish the optimal dosing strategy from PK/Pharmacodynamic (PD) studies."
10694591,"Both HLA class-II polymorphism and gut microbiota had been linked with the regulation of host immunity and
pathobiology of multiple sclerosis (MS) However, it is not known whether there is a crosstalk between HLA
class-II molecules and gut microbiota in the regulation of host immunity which can influence disease outcome
in people with MS (PwMS). Thus, there is a critical unmet need to understand mechanism(s) through which
interaction between HLA class-II polymorphism and gut microbiota modulate disease phenotypes in MS. Our
long-term goal is to determine mechanism(s) through which gut bacteria and their metabolites influence
protection from or predisposition/progression to MS so that we can harness the enormous potential of gut
microbiome as diagnostic and/or therapeutic agent. Previously, we have utilized transgenic mice expressing
MS linked HLA-DR and -DQ alleles in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of
MS to validate the significance of HLA in MS. We have shown that while HLA-DR3 transgenic mice are
susceptible and HLA-DQ8 transgenic mice are resistant to EAE, the presence of HLA-DQ8 allele on a disease
susceptible HLA-DR3 transgenic mice (HLA-DR3.DQ8) results in severe disease. Our data showing that
cytokine and gut microbiota profile being more similar between HLA-DQ8 and HLA-DR3.DQ8 mice than HLA-
DR3 mice suggest a role of HLA-DQ8 restricted gut microbiota and Th17 response in modulation of disease.
Additionally, weaning reaction defined by a period in newborn mammals when expansion of gut microbiota
during early life induces a vigorous immune response, had been shown to play a critical role in maintaining
immune homeostasis through induction of immune imprinting. Based on these observations we hypothesize
that HLA class-II molecules modulate host immunity through regulation of host microbiome during early life and
adulthood and perturbation of the same might lead to predisposition/exacerbation of inflammatory disease
such as MS. We propose to determine the significance of HLA class-II polymorphism in disease resistance vs
susceptibility through its influence on neonatal and adult gut microbiota in two aims. In aim-1, we will determine
significance of HLA class II polymorphism in regulating adult gut microbiota and disease pathogenesis by
characterizing APCs and CD4+ T cells function (cytokine signature) in disease susceptible HLA-DR3 vs. disease
resistance HLA-DQ8 mice in conventional or pseudo-Germ-free mice (antibiotic depleted gut microbiota). We will
also perform microbiome transplantation from disease resistance to susceptible strain and vice versa or
colonization with specific bacteria identified in microbiome analysis to determine whether adult gut microbiome
alone can transfer the immune and disease phenotype. In aim-2, we will determine effect of HLA class II
polymorphism on the selection of neonatal gut microbiota and weaning reaction on immune-imprinting and
disease susceptibility to EAE in adulthood. We will determine the effect of early life gut microbiota in immune
response by characterizing CD4 T cell effector response, frequency, and function of regulatory CD4+ T cells and
APC function in conventional or pseudo-Germ-free mice (antibiotic depleted gut microbiota). Importance of early
life gut microbiota in modulation of EAE disease will be determined by cross-fostering of pups from disease
susceptible with lactating dams from resistant strain and vice versa to determine whether neonatal gut microbiome
alone can transfer the immune and disease phenotype. Successful completion of our study will help in determining
the significance of HLA class-II restricted gut microbiota during early life and adulthood on modulation of immune
response and EAE disease. This project has strong translational potential as it help to identify gut bacteria
linked with disease resistance vs susceptibility which can be used for the development of novel diagnostic,
prognostic and/or therapeutic target for MS. Since HLA class-II polymorphism and gut microbiota had been
linked with multiple autoimmune diseases, the data from our study will be useful for other diseases too."
10906929,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Metastatic progression is the predominant cause of death from solid organ tumors like colorectal cancer but is
poorly understood at the molecular level. While modern systemic therapy has incrementally improved outcomes,
survival in metastatic colorectal cancer remains dismal, with less than 15 percent of patients alive at five years.
Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify and characterize the key genes and pathways that facilitate
metastatic colonization. Using a genome-scale in vivo short hairpin RNA (shRNA) screen, the PI and his
collaborators have identified several putative metastasis promoters including the type 3 inositol 1,4,5-
triphosphate receptor (ITPR3), which mobilizes intracellular calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum. ITPR3
deletion in colorectal cancer cells reduces liver metastatic capacity in vivo, implicating ITPR3 as a key driver of
metastasis. Preliminary data suggest that ITPR3 may allow disseminating cancer cells to overcome physiological
barriers inherent to the metastatic microenvironment, such as the loss of normal extracellular attachment to the
primary epithelial site, potentially through shutting down energetically demanding processes such as protein
translation. In addition, ITPR3 may regulate pro-metastatic non-canonical NF-kB signaling and the associated
transcription factor RELB, which was also identified as a robust metastasis promoter in the shRNA screen. These
studies have led to the hypothesis that ITPR3 is a central coordinator of multiple pathways to support survival
during early and late phases of metastatic colonization. Experiments are proposed to (1) define the mechanisms
by which ITPR3 regulates translation and cellular metabolism through polysome/ribosome profiling, proteomics
and metabolomics, (2) elucidate the mechanism by which ITPR3 controls RELB and non-canonical NF-kB
signaling to facilitate metastasis, and (3) determine whether ITPR3 can be therapeutically targeted using novel
organoids derived from highly metastatic patient-derived xenografts. Successful completion of the proposed work
will improve understanding of the mechanisms underlying metastatic colonization in colorectal cancer and reveal
avenues to develop more effective therapeutic strategies to block metastatic progression. The applicant, Dr.
Ryan Moy, is a Medical Oncology Fellow and member of the Gastrointestinal Oncology Service at Memorial
Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC). Dr. Moy has outlined a 5-year career development plan that expands
on his background in molecular biology and clinical training in oncology to acquire vital skills for becoming an
independent physician-scientist. He will perform the proposed studies under the mentorship of Dr. Sohail
Tavazoie, a physician-scientist and leading expert in metastasis biology with a strong track record of training
successful scientists. Dr. Moy will develop new skills in bioinformatics, metabolomics, proteomics and the
generation of patient-derived cancer models. In addition to this training plan and strong scientific background,
the combined institutional environments of MSKCC and The Rockefeller University ideally position Dr. Moy to
successful develop into an independent laboratory-based physician-scientist with R01 funding."

Cardiovascular Implantable Electronic Devices (CIEDs) like a Permanent Pacemaker or Implantable
Defibrillator are implanted in over 3 million Americans, with the average age of implantation in the 60s,
40% ≥ 70 years old, and 28% ≥ 80 years old. When a patient presents to the Emergency Department (ED)
with an unknown CIED, reprogramming of the device is often necessary for their treatment. Every patient
should know their device type and manufacturer. This information is particularly important, as every device
can be interrogated only by a programmer (a custom computer and magnetic wand) from the CIED’s
specific manufacturer. However, in emergency situations, elderly patients may not have their device
information or may be unable to communicate with hospital personnel, leading to delays in proper
treatment. Most often, ED staff use an x-ray to attempt to read the manufacturer and device type, simply to
help determine the correct manufacturer to ask for assistance. To facilitate prompt and thorough patient
treatment, CIED manufacturers typically provide personnel who are on call in or near medical facilities to
assist with any device-related issues. To solve this problem, BridgeSource Medical proposes a portable
handheld device that can identify CIEDs from any manufacturer either in the ED, or in transit to the ED,
eliminating the need for a time-consuming and unnecessary x-ray, and enabling first-line medical
personnel. The proposed device identifier works by mimicking the “wakeup call” communication of the five
major CIED programmers in sequence, and would identify each device by analyzing the response from the
CIED."
10833666,"ABSTRACT:
Recent clinical and preclinical evidence has shown that gliomas can initially grow, invade, evade antiangiogenic therapies
and eventually recur by hijacking or “co-opting” the brain’s preexisting blood vessels. Vascular co-option is a
nonangiogenic glioma growth mechanism in which, co-opting tumor cells cause astrocytes to lose intimate contact with
blood vessels, i.e. cause gliovascular uncoupling (GVU), and alter cerebral hemodynamics. Additionally, in aggressive high-
grade gliomas (e.g. glioblastoma or GBM), vessel co-option facilitates the migration and invasion of cancer cells into
healthy brain tissue. Yet, the evolution of vessel co-option over the glioma’s life-time, resultant GVU and hemodynamic
changes remain poorly understood due to a lack of microvascular-resolution lifecycle and multimodality/multiscale
imaging approaches. Moreover, co-optive glioma growth is radiologically undetectable due to an absence of contrast
enhancement and the lack of specificity of conventional MRI (e.g. T2/FLAIR) approaches. Therefore, our goal is to use an
image-based systems biology approach to elucidate the hemodynamics of co-optive glioma over its lifecycle and
develop an fMRI biomarker of co-option induced GVU. Guided by compelling preliminary data, we will pursue three
Specific Aims: (1) Characterize vessel co-option in a patient-derived glioma xenograft (PDX) over its lifecycle with
multiscale imaging; (2) Develop an image-based model of brain-wide hemodynamic changes induced by vessel co-option
in glioma; and (3) Determine if rs-fMRI can detect vessel co-option induced GVU in a patient-derived glioma xenograft.
Under Aim1, we propose a paradigm-shifting approach that employs a miniscope for microvessel resolution (~5 µm)
multicontrast in vivo imaging of co-option induced hemodynamic changes over the lifecycle of a patient-derived glioma
xenograft. We will complement these microvascular-scale measurements with multimodality/multiscale whole-brain data
from ex vivo CT/MRI/light sheet microscopy (LSM) in the same animal to corelate structural/functional/cellular changes
in the vascular microenvironment (VME). Under Aim2, we employ these data in a model of co-option induced
hemodynamic dysregulation to simulate brain-wide changes that could be exploited as fMRI biomarkers of co-optive
glioma. Under Aim3, we will determine if resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) can detect GVU in a co-optive PDX and differentiate
it from non-co-optive glioma growth. Our approach is innovative because it blends cutting-edge advances in miniaturized
microscopy, multiscale/multimodality imaging and image-based systems biology. The proposed research is significant
because these studies will establish: (i) freely downloadable, co-registered multiscale data for cancer systems biology
investigators; (ii) a hemodynamic model for co-optive glioma; (iii) a novel biomarker of glioma co-option with the potential
to transform patient management and stimulate the development of therapies to thwart antiangiogenic resistance. We
also expect this approach to be adaptable to other CNS diseases dependent on vessel co-option (e.g. brain metastases)."

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), is one of the deadliest pathogens
on the planet, and for decades, TB has been the leading cause of death due to infectious disease. The cell
envelope of Mtb forms a notoriously tough barrier around the cell, protecting the bacterium from harsh agents
in the environment such as antibiotics and host immune responses. At the same time, Mtb imports nutrients
from the host cell, such as cholesterol, across the cell envelope. Transport of lipids, metabolites and nutrients
across the cell envelope, between the inner and outer membranes is critical for building and maintaining the
cell envelope itself, and for import of key factors required for bacterial growth. Therefore, the transport systems
that facilitate this trafficking are critical for allowing Mtb to survive and thrive in its intracellular niche, most
typically macrophages in the lungs.
 The MCE (Mammalian Cell Entry) family of proteins are transport systems that have been implicated as
virulence factors in Mtb, and are an expanded protein family in mycobacteria compared with other
double-membraned bacteria. In Mtb, several lines of evidence suggest that MCE systems are important for
importing nutrients such as cholesterol and fatty acids. Recent work on E. coli MCE systems has shown that
these are multi-protein complexes anchored in the inner membrane of double-membraned bacteria, and may
play an important role in the maintenance of outer membrane integrity, raising the possibility that this may also
be a role that MCE proteins play in Mtb. The structure and mechanisms of the highly complex MCE systems in
Mtb remain unknown, and studying these is critical for understanding how MCE systems work, what their
substrates are, and how they may be linked to virulence.
 This proposal is focused on biochemical and structural characterization of MCE transport systems from
Mtb and the non-pathogenic model, Mycobacterium smegmatis. Using single particle cryo-EM, mass
spectrometry, biochemical and functional assays, we aim to study the structure and function of endogenous
Mtb MCE systems, decipher which protein subunits come together to form complexes and define
protein-protein interactions that are important for the systems to assemble and function. The results of this
work will provide important insights into the structure and function of the large, multi-protein MCE complexes in
the Mtb cell envelope, and how they influence replication and virulence in the host."

Accumulating evidence over the years suggests that microbial exposure and the ensuing immune response has
a large role in the incidence and progression of age-associated neurodegenerative diseases, including in
Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Yet, research on this neurodegenerative disease has primarily utilized genetic mouse
models that are reared in ultra-hygienic specific pathogen free (SPF) laboratory environments. The highly
sanitized SPF environment prevents inadvertent microbial exposure and reduces experimental variability. But
without routine microbial stimulation, the immune system of these SPF mice remains in a predominantly naïve
state comprising mostly of antigen-inexperienced immune cell populations. Importantly, these naïve cells remain
sequestered in the lymphoid tissues and do not access disease-affected organs. Thus, studying animals reared
in SPF conditions may mask important contributions of the immune system to neurodegenerative diseases. If
true, this may be a major contributing factor to the failure of translating findings from rodents to humans, which
are naturally exposed to a variety of pathogens. Dr. Beura (co-investigator in this application) has demonstrated
that SPF mice co-housed with pet store mice (herein referred as “dirty” mice) not only have a higher number of
immune cells in peripheral organs, as compared to SPF mice, but their immune cells also display maturation
traits that are more typical of the human immune system. Based on these findings and the known role of the
immune system in AD, we assessed the impact of a pathogen-rich environment on the 5XFAD mouse model of
AD. We present preliminary data demonstrating that the immune system is heightened in dirty compared to SPF
5XFAD mice. Additionally, our preliminary data show increased gliosis in 6-month-old dirty compared to SPF
5XFAD mice. While these findings are promising, cohousing approaches have several shortcomings that limit its
wider deployment, including variable transmission of pathogens and fighting among male mice. To overcome
these limitations, we developed a new microbial exposure regimen that optimizes pathogen transmission leading
to reproducible changes in the immune system of both male and female mice. In this proposal, we will use this
novel regimen to define the contribution of a pathogen-rich environment and matured plus heightened immune
system on AD mouse models of amyloid pathology. To establish this novel approach, we will perform
experiments in two aims. First, we will determine the impact of a pathogen-rich environment on immune
maturation in two mouse models of AD amyloid neuropathology, 5XFAD and APPNL-F, and a mouse model of AD
tauopathy, PS19. Second, we will determine the timing and magnitude of AD pathological indices in 5XFAD,
APPNL-F and PS19 mice exposed to dirty and SPF conditions. Together, the proposed experiments will provide
unique insights about the underpinning of AD pathogenesis and reveal unique contributions of a microbe-rich
environment and matured immune system."

 During pregnancy, maternal metabolism goes through a series of adaptations to meet the constant
nutrient demand from the fetal compartment and prepare lactation. Failure of maternal metabolic adaptation
causes gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and other complications. There is a significant increase in islet
mass and insulin production during normal pregnancy. The pancreatic α-cells are the second primary
endocrine cells in islets and regulate glucose metabolism mainly through the endocrine effects of glucagon.
Although studies have reported that pregnancy may increase α-cell mass and maternal blood glucagon
concentrations, there is a knowledge gap about the role of α-cells in controlling maternal metabolic adaptation.
Our most recent study demonstrated the essential role of α-cells in maternal insulin production during
pregnancy. First, we ablated α-cells in adult mice using an inducible genetic approach. Despite no significant
change in fasting and randomly fed blood glucose concentrations, α-cell ablation improved glucose tolerance
in non-pregnant mice. In contrast, a significant elevation of blood glucose concentrations and low insulin
secretion were observed in α-null dams. Second, we treated pregnant mice with a glucagon receptor antibody
during pregnancy to determine the contribution of glucagon in maternal metabolic adaptation. Surprisingly,
glucagon receptor antagonism did not alter maternal blood glucose and insulin levels. Besides glucagon, α-
cells also secret glucagon-like protein 1 (GLP-1). It is known that intraislet GLP-1 plays an important role in
augmenting glucose-induced insulin production under metabolic stress conditions. Our study showed that
GLP-1 receptor agonist restored insulin production and glucose metabolism in α-null dams. Therefore, we
hypothesize that α-cells play a vital role in regulating maternal metabolic adaptation through the intraislet
paracrine effects on insulin production. We will use the α cell-specific Pcsk1 gene, which directs GLP-1
production, knockout dams, and glucagon or GLP-1 reconstitution to verify this hypothesis. Mouse models with
α cell-specific prolactin receptor (Prlr) gene knockout will be employed to verify the role of PL/PRLR in
regulating α-cell adaptation to pregnancy and intraislet GLP-1 production. We will use the RNAseq approach to
compare gene expression profiles in sorted α-cells from pregnant mice and hormone-treated human islets to
determine how α-cell adapt to pregnancy. The success of this project will reveal a new underlying mechanism
of maternal metabolic adaptation. It will significantly impact the research of both reproductive medicine and
GDM."

Candida glabrata is an important human fungal pathogen capable of causing both systemic and mucosal
infections in a wide variety of immunocompromised individuals, including organ transplant recipients, cancer
patients on chemotherapy and AIDS patients. C. glabrata is the second most frequently isolated Candida
species in invasive bloodstream infections, has a high crude mortality rate (~40-60%), and has been classified
as a “serious” threat to public health by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). While resistance of C. glabrata
clinical isolates to multiple antifungals, particularly azoles, is on the rise only three major drug classes are
available for treatment. Previous studies have shown that C. glabrata antifungal resistance can be attributed to
a variety of genetic point mutations, chromosomal rearrangements as well as increased transcription of certain
drug efflux pumps. In contrast to genetic and transcriptional mechanisms, very little is known about
translational mechanisms that control antifungal resistance in C. glabrata or other human fungal pathogens.
However, we and others have shown that long 5’ UTR-mediated translational efficiency mechanisms play an
important role in controlling the expression of several key regulators of virulence-related processes in Candida
albicans and, based on RNA-seq data, many C. glabrata genes specifically involved in azole resistance also
possess long 5’ UTRs that could be involved in translational regulation. Using genome-wide ribosome profiling,
we have recently demonstrated that the C. albicans yeast-filament transition is under widespread translational
control and several genes associated with antifungal resistance also showed altered translational efficiency
during this transition. A similar ribosome profiling analysis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is more closely
related to C. glabrata, also showed significant translational expression changes in response to oxidative stress.
Many C. glabrata genes important for protein synthesis are significantly down-regulated in response to azole
treatment. In addition, only a small fraction of C. glabrata genes showing altered protein expression in azole
resistant vs. susceptible isolates also showed changes at the transcript level and evidence suggests that C.
glabrata ERG11, encoding the azole target lanosterol 14-demethylase, could be under translational control.
Based on these observations, we hypothesize that translational mechanisms play an important role in
controlling azole resistance in C. glabrata. In order to test this hypothesis, we will: 1) determine the genome-
wide translational profile of C. glabrata in response to treatment with fluconazole, the most commonly used
azole drug, 2) identify and characterize translational mechanisms important for driving C. glabrata azole
resistance. Ultimately, this study will provide a better understanding of global regulatory circuits and pathways
that control C. glabrata azole resistance at the translational level. In addition, this study will identify and
characterize several key translationally regulated factors important for C. glabrata drug resistance that could
potentially serve as targets for the development of novel antifungal strategies."

The first drugs directed against protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) have now entered the market and represent
breakthroughs in the treatment of cancer; however, challenges remain, including the fact that patients develop
resistance to such drugs. Alternative approaches, to target simultaneously different signaling enzymes and
events, are required. The protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), which work in combination with the PTKs, have
been garnering attention as potential therapeutic targets. Despite major programs in industry focused on
developing small molecule PTP inhibitors, technical challenges arising from the chemical properties of the PTP
active site have frustrated such efforts. Consequently, they remain a largely untapped resource for drug
development. Nevertheless, the extensive biological validation of PTPs emphasizes the importance of
discovering new approaches to inhibitor development. This grant, currently in Year 28, focuses on a functional
analysis of specific PTPs in models of cancer. The hypothesis to be tested is that PTPs function as specific
regulators of tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent signaling pathways and thus manipulation of their function in
cell and animal models will reveal new insights into the critical signaling events that underlie the disease. The
overall goal is to define functional links between particular PTPs and specific signaling pathways in cancer, with
a view to establishing how disruption of such functions affects the etiology of the disease and to reveal novel
therapeutic targets from among the PTPs themselves or from the signaling pathways they regulate. In the
previous funding period, major breakthroughs were achieved in several aspects of the project: (1) New and
improved allosteric inhibitors of PTP1B, including molecules that chelate copper specifically, were developed,
creating opportunities to exploit a novel vulnerability in cancer; (2) Identification of PTP1B inhibitors that are
cytotoxic to Herceptin-resistant cells; (3) Demonstration that PTP1B inhibitors prevent fatality in the TRALI model
of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, attenuating neutrophil activation and formation of NETs, suggesting
novel opportunities for therapeutic intervention in cancer; (4) Integration of BioID MS with substrate-trapping
mutant PTPs to enhance substrate trapping technology and generate new insights into the function of PTP1B in
Herceptin-resistant cells, illustrating an approach can now be applied to the PTP family as a whole to validate
new therapeutic targets. Building on the unique and innovative approaches developed during previous funding
periods, this proposal assembles a strong team of collaborators to address the following Specific Aims, which
represent a logical development of progress to date: 1: To define the mechanism by which PTP1B represents a
point of vulnerability in Herceptin-resistant cells. 2: To validate copper chelation and PTP1B inhibition as a new
avenue to cancer therapy 3: To define the mechanism by which PTP1B regulates the formation of Neutrophil
Extracellular Traps (NETs) and to investigate how this may be exploited therapeutically in a cancer context. 4:
Application of Substrate-Trapping/BioID technology to define PTP function in cancer models."

The process of abstraction involves identifying the features shared across past experiences so as to represent
a complex environment using only a small number of variables. Abstraction obviates the need to represent all
combinations of values for all features and enables generalization to novel environments. Such generalization is
fundamental to rapid, flexible adjustments in behavioral, cognitive, and emotional responses. However, it re-
mains unknown how the human brain learns to represent past experiences to reflect their shared features and
enable generalization, nor how this process is modulated by different timescales of learning, memory consolida-
tion, multiple levels of abstraction, and motivational states. To answer these questions, we adapt for human fMRI
a theoretical framework and analytic methodology from recent work in non-human primates. Healthy human
subjects learn a complex reversal-learning task with multiple stimuli linked by a hidden structure that can be
represented by a small number of variables. In pilot data, subjects learn this structure, which they demonstrate
via inference: a change in one stimulus is sufficient to infer the new values for the remaining stimuli. We analyze
multivoxel fMRI activity to probe for the relationships, or geometry, between neural representations, which we
test for an ‘abstract format’, i.e., a format that enables generalization, as well as quantify its dimensionality, or
capacity to represent a large number of (non-abstract) variables. In Aim 1, we probe the evolution of neural
representations during learning at multiple timescales, from hours to a week, to provide mechanistic insight into
the formation and consolidation of abstract representations. We predict that (1) the abstract format will emerge
first for ‘explicit’ variables (e.g., response and outcome) in regions associated with sensorimotor processing. (2)
After multi-day training and consolidation, we predict that ‘hidden’ variables defined by the task’s temporal
statistics will be represented in an abstract format, first by regions that encode relational knowledge (e.g., medial
temporal lobe), which then relay this information to prefrontal regions that encode abstract rules and task states.
Aim 2 compares different levels of abstraction, from identifying shared features across specific instances to a
system of general states that can be transferred to novel problems. We compare the neural geometry and brain
regions (e.g., hippocampus vs. entorhinal cortex) that support these distinct levels. Aim 3 investigates the role
of appetitive vs. aversive outcomes, which profoundly influence decision-making and learning, but their distinct
roles in abstraction are unknown. This gap is striking given that many psychiatric disorders involve impaired
abstraction and generalization tied to aversive experiences. To address this gap, subjects perform alternating
versions of the task under gain or loss domains. We will test how motivational valence impacts abstract learning
and neural geometry. In all Aims, we relate individual differences in behavior and affective processing to
differences in neural geometry. Going forward, the framework provides a foundation for linking neural geometry
to cognitive and emotional function with broad applicability to cognitive neuroscience and psychopathology."

Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementia are a growing public health crisis affecting 5.8 million Americans, yet
there are only four FDA-approved medications for Alzheimer’s Disease, none of which are disease-modifying.
Hence, early detection and diagnosis are key to successful patient management and biomarkers are needed for
evaluating new therapies in clinical trials. White matter changes are increasingly implicated in early Alzheimer’s
Disease progression, and diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) has been included in many
national-scale studies. Yet, quantitative investigation of DW-MRI data is hindered by a lack of consistency due
to variation in acquisition protocols, sites, and scanners. DW-MRI enables quantification of brain microstructure
and facilitates structural connectivity mapping. Substantial recent progress has been made with calibration and
harmonization to reduce inter-subject variance and improve interpretability of computed measures. Yet, the
fundamental challenge remains that clinical application of DW-MRI (as currently implemented) is
confounded by inter-scanner and inter-site effects.
To improve understanding of structural changes in Alzheimer’s Disease, we will construct and evaluate three
separate analysis strategies to characterize, calibrate, and optimize DW-MRI for single-subject biomarker
development for Alzheimer’s Disease. We will integrate and optimize our strategies using large retrospective
multi-site studies and validate the approaches on two distinct prospective cohorts. Specifically, we aim to:
Aim 1: Optimize data-driven techniques for stability across sessions, scanners/sites, and field strengths
Impact: Harmonized DW-MRI methods will increase sensitivity to Alzheimer’s Disease and its prodromal stages.
Aim 2: Translate innovations in microstructural harmonization to structural connectivity (tractography)
Impact: Harmonizing structural connectivity will improve understanding of white matter in Alzheimer’s Disease.
Aim 3: Advance statistical tools for single-subject inference through normative database construction
Impact: Data-driven resources for uncertainty estimation will enable robust single-single subject inference.
Relevance and Impact on Healthcare: The proposed research will advance understanding of Alzheimer’s
Disease through (1) quantitative harmonization of DW-MRI biomarkers, (2) protocols for harmonization of
retrospective and prospective DW-MRI studies, and (3) new tools for single subject inference targeting older
cohorts. We will organize workshops/challenges to maximize the translational impact on clinical science. The
long-term goal of our research is to (1) provide a well-validated strategy to quantitatively evaluate DW-MRI data
across sites, (2) enhance DW-MRI biomarkers for Alzheimer’s Disease, and (3) advance patient care. Our
research strategy will transform the manner in which DW-MRI data are interpreted and enable single-subject
machine learning to interpret brain properties. The resources, software, and visualization tools will be made
freely available in open source through DIPY to facilitate continued innovation."
10897044,"Project Summary:
Illness behaviors, metabolic disturbances, and cardiovascular compromise are common in patients with
chronic systemic diseases, and contribute substantially to quality of life and ultimate survival. Other illness-
induced morbidities including anorexia and lethargy also compromise the ability of patients to recover from life-
saving or extending interventions, and diminish the motivational drive to aggressively battle the underlying
condition. Although cachexia in cancer patients was described more than two thousand years ago, the central
mechanisms underlying this disorder are poorly understood. Furthermore, there is currently no effective
pharmaceutical treatment. Cardiovascular impairment is common in all chronic diseases, and can be a
presenting complaint in cancer patients, even prior to initiation of therapy. Our laboratory is dedicated to
unraveling the basic mechanisms whereby cancer triggers neuroinflammation and subsequent chronic
activation of systemic stress responses in patients with cancer. In this proposal, we will focus on understanding
the scope and mechanism by which systemic illness induces chronic activation and alteration in the
sympathetic nervous system. The significance of this proposal resides in its unique combination of our
historical focus on neuroendocrinology and neuroinflammation, with new collaborations and efforts directed at
understanding the extent and mechanisms of cardiovascular impairment and sympathetic nervous system
plasticity in patients with cancer. The long-term goal of our research is to gain mechanistic understanding of
the acute illness response and how it is transitioned into chronic neuroinflammation in all cancer types, in order
to develop more effective therapeutic interventions."

Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a fatal muscle disease with an incidence of 1 in 5000 males. DMD
results from mutations in the gene encoding dystrophin, a 427 kDa scaffolding protein responsible for providing
a mechanical link between the muscle fiber actin cytoskeleton and laminin in the extracellular matrix. The α7β1
integrin is a transmembrane linkage system in skeletal and cardiac muscle that also links laminin to the actin
cytoskeleton. Studies have demonstrated that transgenic and virally mediated overexpression of the α7 integrin
alleviates disease progression and improves survival of mouse models of DMD. Loss of the α7 integrin in
dystrophin-deficient mdx mice results in severe muscle disease. Together these studies demonstrate that the
α7β1 integrin can serve as a surrogate for the loss of dystrophin and is a target for drug-based therapies. The
Burkin lab has previously shown treatments with compounds that increase the α7 integrin in dystrophic muscle
lead to enhanced muscle regeneration, improved skeletal muscle strength and decreased myofiber damage. In
the Phase 2A STTR, Strykagen has shown that treatments with our lead Stryka969 small molecule are safe, on-
target, and have beneficial effects for both dystrophic mouse skeletal and cardiac muscle. In this Phase 2B SBIR
proposal, we propose to complete IND-enabling Stryka969 tier 2 ADME, organ toxicity, and metabolite profiling
studies. We will also assess the serum pharmacokinetics of Stryka969 in both canine and non-human primates.
Lastly, we will perform an efficacy study in the large animal GRMD dog model, considered the gold standard
animal model for DMD. These studies will scale the therapeutic treatment using Stryka969 in a large animal
preclinical model that more closely recapitulates DMD patient skeletal and cardiac disease. Results from this
study will move Stryka969, as a first in class α7β1 integrin enhancing molecules, towards IND and clinical trials
for patients with DMD."
10833188,"Project summary. Approximately half of people with HIV (PWH) in the US smoke cigarettes, and the most
optimistic predictions indicate that notwithstanding aggressive anti-smoking efforts, the large majority of these
individuals will continue to smoke. The overall goal is to evaluate the potential of a harm reduction (HR)
strategy to improve the health of a much broader swath of PWH smokers, both those who quit and those who
continue smoking. We will offer all participants an evidence-based, intensive combined behavioral (Positively
Smoke Free on the Web embedded within the BecomeAnEX [EX+] online community) and pharmacologic
cessation treatment followed by a HR intervention in those who are randomized to EX+/HR and treatment as
usual (TAU) in those who are randomized to EX+/TAU. HR will consist of an informational video encouraging
those who have not yet quit to cut down, and patient navigator assisted low-dose CT (LDCT) lung cancer
screening and referral to Cardiometabolic Clinic to optimize blood pressure and lipid management (the latter
two referrals for those who qualify based on age, smoking history, blood pressure, and/or cholesterol
measurements). The specific aims are to (1) complete an RCT comparing these approaches at Montefiore
Medical Center in the Bronx with 400 participants randomized 1:1 to EX+/HR or EX+/TAU with the primary
outcomes of change in (Δ) # cigarettes smoked per day (CPD), % completing LDCT lung cancer screening, Δ
systolic blood pressure, Δ total cholesterol, and Δ American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association
(ACC/AHA) Pooled Cohort Equation score (PCEs) for risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and
biochemically confirmed abstinence at 9-months, (2) to perform cost-effectiveness modeling of these two
approaches with projections beyond the horizon of the grant period and estimates for national impact if the
approaches were disseminated to the entirety of the US PWH population, and (3) to complete RE-AIM
analyses of the approaches in order to assess their feasibility, sustainability, and generalizability.
 The overarching hypothesis of the research is that the EX+/HR approach will generate significantly greater
advantages in terms of reduced risk for death from lung cancer and cardiovascular disease that translate into
reduced morbidity and mortality when modeled on a macro level.
 The project will leverage the long-term collaborations of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine/Montefiore
Medical Center with Truth Initiative, Westat, and the Medical Practice Evaluation Center (MPEC) of the
Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), which has led the research and public health world in modeling the
effects of behaviors and therapeutic strategies, including tobacco use behaviors and treatments, on the long-
term health of PWH in the US and beyond. They will employ their Cost-Effectiveness of Preventing AIDS
Complications (CEPAC) microsimulation methodology with inputs from our trial and from public-domain
datasets to estimate the effects that our two approaches would have on the PWH smoker population nationally."
10906836,"ABSTRACT
Heterochromatin, a gene-repressive nuclear ultrastructure, is required for the normal patterning of the genome
into active and inactive regions, to preserve structural integrity and drive and maintain developmental fates.
While heterochromatin assembly is locally nucleated by DNA-sequences, the majority of the patterning process
requires it to spread along the chromatin template. A major form of heterochromatin involved in this patterning
is signaled by methylation (me) at Lysine 9 (K9) of histone 3 (H3). Major questions have remained unanswered
about heterochromatin spreading, which has limited our ability to effectively manipulate this process for
regenerative medicine or synthetic biology: 1. What are the biochemical mechanisms underlying it? 2. How can
heterochromatin spread over loci of vastly different chemical, structural and stability regimes? And 3. How is the
reaction tuned to expand or contract during development to stabilize cell fate switches? Over the last four years,
my laboratory has devised strategies to tackle these questions. We have developed single-cell sensors of
heterochromatin spreading that have enabled us to document the intrinsic behavior of the reaction in real-time
(Al-Sady et al, 2016; Greenstein et al, 2018), how euchromatic features sculpt the spreading reaction (Greenstein
et al 2019) and defined genes that enable this process in different chromatin environments (Greenstein & Ng et
al, 2020). Additionally, we have developed single molecule systems to study histone methylation on individual
chromatin strands and bulk biochemical methods to probe the function of the H3K9me “writer machines”. Over
the next five years, we will deploy these experimental systems to fully illuminate the heterochromatin spreading
process from three angles: 1. The writer machine: We will use single molecule and biochemical sequencing
approaches to unravel the mechanisms and molecular trajectories by which the enzyme complexes “write”
H3K9me along the chromatin template. 2. The substrate: Heterochromatin spreading occurs over radically
different chromatin landscapes and cannot fit a “one-size-fits-all” model. We will use single-cell heterochromatin
spreading sensors in fission yeast to examine how chromatin loci of different activity states or the same locus
with different histories impact the reaction. Further, we will define the genetic circuitry that enables and tunes
spreading in different chromatin environments. 3. The view form development: We focus on the developmentally
crucial H3K9 methylase G9a/GLP and will distinguish different hypotheses on how developmentally triggered,
G9a/GLP-dependent heterochromatin expansions and contractions are implemented in mammalian stem cells.
Further, since the relationship between H3K9 methylation by G9a/GLP and silencing is elusive, we will define
the steps that must occur for gene repression after H3K9 methylation. Together, this suite of projects connects
the intrinsic biochemical features of heterochromatin spreading, to the steady-state and developmentally
dynamic genome partitioning function of this unique ultrastructure, which underlies genome and cell fate stability."
10866344,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
An estimated 90% of cervical cancer related deaths take place in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs),
where the burden of disease is highest and there is limited access to effective screening and diagnosis [1]. In
July 2021, the World Health Organization updated their recommended approach for cervical cancer screening
to focus on human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing. However, it remains difficult for many women to access
HPV DNA testing due to the necessary costs, high level of infrastructure, and requirement for trained
personnel. Compared to expensive commercial platforms, a variety of promising point-of-care (POC) strategies
have proposed isothermal amplification of DNA as an affordable avenue for testing [2]–[6]; however, there are
important gaps to fully incorporate integrated sample-to-answer platforms that eliminate the risk of workspace
contamination and subsequent false positive results. The objective of this project is to develop a low-cost
(<$3/test, $500/instrument) fully integrated, quantitative HPV DNA test platform that is simple to use for
effective HPV screening at the POC. The Richards-Kortum lab has shown that isothermal amplification with
Recombinase Polymerase Amplification can be performed in paper membranes [7]. More recently, the Posner
group demonstrated the capability to detect discrete fluorescent amplification nucleation sites using a paper
membrane to quantify HIV-1 DNA using a mobile phone-based imager [8]. This proposal builds upon recent
advances to design a two-dimensional paper microfluidic device and low-cost imaging platform for detection of
high risk HPV types, HPV16 and HPV18, the primary causes of cervical cancer. This proposal will accomplish
these goals by pursuing the following three specific aims: 1) Designing a test to accept and process cervical
cytology specimens with pre-loaded lyophilized reagents for amplification of HPV 16/HPV 18 DNA, 2)
Developing a low-cost instrument, including a heater and fluorimeter, to monitor multiplexed real-time
isothermal nucleic acid amplification reactions, and 3) Conducting a proof-of-principle study to assess usability
and efficacy of the test and instrument designed, using banked clinical samples in Houston and within a low
resource setting in Mozambique, Africa. Sensitivity, specificity, and limit of detection analysis will be used to
determine comparability to gold standard technologies. Completing these aims will improve cervical cancer
screening and reduce morbidity and mortality in underserved areas of the world. This project benefits greatly
from co-mentorship from Dr. Rebecca Richards-Kortum and her colleague Kathleen Schmeler, who both have
extensive experience in evaluating new technologies for cervical cancer prevention and translating them to
low-resource settings. The training plan and environment have been specifically tailored, focusing on multi-
disciplinary, hands-on coursework, lab work, and teaching, and translational research aims with deployment
within an LMIC to ensure project success and scalability."
10825617,"Abstract
Sensorineural hearing loss is a debilitating condition with no cure that directly impacts >30 million people. A
common cause of inherited hearing loss is the disruption of cochlear hair cell stereocilia, which are essential
for transducing sound vibrations to the brain. For proper function, stereocilia must be tall enough to reach the
tectorial membrane (TM) and form stereocilia-TM junctions (STJs). Stereocilia elongation greatly depends on
actin regulation; as such, disruption of actin regulatory proteins and other cytoskeletal elements cause
profound hearing loss in humans and model organisms. Thus, it is critical to elucidate the dynamic regulation
of stereocilia lengths to understand normal hearing and determine how to rescue stereocilia-related hearing
loss. Previous work demonstrated that stereocilia actin filament elongation depends on epidermal growth factor
pathway substrate 8 (Eps8), an actin-regulatory protein that is critical for hearing in both mice and humans.
Eps8 paradoxically contains domains with both actin filament capping and bundling activities, which are
typically associated with shortening or elongation of actin filaments, respectively. Moreover, it was found that
two other deafness-associated proteins essential for stereocilia elongation, Myosin-XVa (MyoXVa) and whirlin,
bind to Eps8 at stereocilia tips in a tripartite complex. Preliminary data show that stereocilin, another deafness-associated protein which links stereocilia to the TM at STJs, is not properly targeted to stereocilia tips in Eps8,
MyoXVa, or whirlin knockout (KO) mice, and that all these mice lack normal STJs. Moreover, early (≤postnatal
day 1) adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated delivery of Eps8 can rescue stereocilia elongation, stereocilin
localization, and STJs in Eps8 KO mouse apical hair cells, suggesting that it may be possible to rescue hearing
function. This proposal tests the hypothesis that Eps8 regulates stereocilia elongation and the proper formation
of STJs by directly regulating actin bundle growth through its C-terminal actin capping and bundling regions
and indirectly regulating stereocilia growth through interactions with MyoXVa and whirlin. Further, it is
proposed that there is a critical window of hair cell maturation during which stereocilia plasticity is sufficient for
full rescue. To test these hypotheses, an AAV-mediated delivery of Eps8 mutants lacking either or both
capping and bundling domains (Aim 1) or Eps8 mutants lacking MyoXVa-, whirlin-, or actin-binding activity
(Aim 2) in Eps8 KO models will be used. In addition, novel light- and chemically-inducible Eps8 mice will be
employed to explore cochlear plasticity and define the critical window for restoring hair cell function in vivo (Aim
3A). The potential for partial reprogramming to expand or restore the critical window for rescuing hair cell
function (Aim 3B) will be investigated. Thus, by combining advanced genetic tools, high-resolution imaging,
and hearing assays, the basic cell biological mechanisms of stereocilia length regulation will be elucidated and
innovative strategies for restoring hearing will be developed."
10873948,"Over 1 million men in the U.S. are receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) to prevent prostate cancer
progression. Although a critical therapeutic strategy, ADT increases the risk of frailty, weight gain and obesity
in prostate cancer survivors (PCS). In our recent study, the odds of PCS having both obesity plus frailty, i.e.,
obese frailty, were 19x higher in ADT users compared to non-users and obese frailty was a significant and
stronger predictor of recurrent falls than frailty alone. Thus, interventions are urgently needed to mitigate the
obese frailty in PCS that threatens independence and quality of life and which multiplies health care costs.
However, there are currently no effective interventions in clinical practice for PCS that target obese frailty as a
clinical endpoint. Given that the number of PCS on ADT is growing by over 30,000 each year, there is a critical
need to develop scalable interventions with high reach potential to address this urgent practice gap and rising
public health issue. The co-principal investigators for this application each have strong prior work
demonstrating efficacy for reducing obesity via online dietary intervention and frailty via online supervised
resistance training, respectively. The urgent need to address obese frailty in PCS on ADT now supports
combining these interventions into a single, scalable online program. To advance this work toward clinical
practice, our strong multidisciplinary team of experts in nutrition, exercise science, urology, oncology,
behavioral theory, health economics, and implementation science, proposes a 2-arm parallel group
randomized Type I hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial focused on obese frailty in PCS on ADT. This
design allows formal testing of the effectiveness of a combined online, self-directed weight loss + group-based
resistance training program (Internet-Based Lifestyle Intervention to Eradicate Obese Frailty in Prostate
Cancer Survivors: iLIVE) against usual care with obese frailty as a primary endpoint. Our Primary Aim is to
compare iLIVE to UC on obese frailty in 250 PCS on ADT over a 6-month period. Secondary Aims are to: a)
Compare the effect of iLIVE to UC on secondary outcomes, e.g., individual frailty criterion, dietary quality,
physical function, quality of life; b) Assess the durability of iLIVE to UC by comparing groups at 12-month
follow-up; and c) Explore potential moderators (e.g., age, race, BMI) associated with intervention effectiveness.
Finally, our Tertiary Aim is to: Assess key implementation outcomes (e.g., cost, acceptability) to guide future
research regarding the implementation of iLIVE into the clinical care pathway. iLIVE builds on a solid
foundation of diet and exercise interventions in cancer survivors with proven efficacy, and the proposed Type I
hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial is designed to speed effectiveness testing and optimization and
ultimately enable reductions in morbidity and mortality for over 1 million older PCS across the nation."

The duration of antibody-mediated immunity varies widely with the specific immunization or infection for
reasons that remain difficult to understand or predict. The specific features of molecular circuitry in B cells and
plasma cells that are responsible for these differences have still not been defined. In this application, which
requests a second renewal of our R01 award, we seek to objectively define 1) molecular programs and cellular
trajectories that lead to long-lived plasma cells in primary responses; 2) transcriptional and epigenetic features
of memory B cells that precede durable recall responses. We will employ two BTB-POZ transcription factors
that functionally oppose each other to gain molecular footholds on programs that control plasma cell lifespan.
Modern single cell transcriptional and epigenetic programs will be employed alongside classic model antigens
and adjuvants and new genetic tools to manipulate genes in vivo. Though the experimental plan is
fundamental and basic in nature, the hope is that this work will lead to a set of rules that help predict and
optimize the duration of humoral immunity."

A fundamental feature of human brain is its ability to use contextual information from past experience to
modulate behavior. Failure to use context to modulate behavior has a great impact in human health. For
instance, individuals with neurological and mental disorders often have difficulties understanding their physical
surroundings and social settings, lowering their quality of life, and damaging their ability to interact with others.
While the importance of context-dependent modulation of behavior is clear, little is known about the molecular
and circuit principles that facilitate this key brain function. In this proposal I aim to uncover signaling
mechanisms that tune the activity of neural circuits to support context-dependent behavior. To this end, I will
take advantage of the genetic power and the circuit simplicity of the nematode C. elegans. My working
hypothesis is that cGMP signals facilitate context-dependent behavior by fine tuning the activity of neuronal
circuits that regulate behavior. To understand how individual components of a cGMP signaling pathway
contribute to context-dependent behavior in living animals, I have designed experiments with two specific aims.
Aim 1 will examine a working hypothesis that cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels regulate context-
dependent behavior. In support of this hypothesis, I found that two genes of CNG channel subunits (tax-2 and
cng-3) are required for context-dependent behavior. To understand the role of CNG channels, I will identify the
neuron(s) in which tax-2 and cng-3 function, and I will determine their impact on neuronal activity in living
circuits for locomotor behavior. Results from this Aim will determine how CNG channels influence context
integration in living circuits. Aim 2 will Determine the role of cGMP metabolism in context-dependent
modulation of behavior. cGMP is a short-lived molecular messenger. Its synthesis and degradation are under
the control of metabolic enzymes. My working hypothesis is that specific enzymes underlying cGMP
metabolism have an important role in context-dependent modulation of living neural circuits. Consistent with
this idea, I identified three genes (gcy-12, gcy-18, and pde-4), encoding enzymes of cGMP metabolism, as key
players in context-dependent behavior. To elucidate how these cGMP enzymes modulate context-dependent
behavior, I will determine the neurons where gcy-12, gcy-18, and pde-4 function and demonstrate their role in
coupling the sensation of contextual information to behavior modulation. Together, studies in this proposal will
elucidate the molecular and circuit mechanisms behind the cGMP modulation of context-dependent behavior."

For people living with HIV (PLWH), achieving and maintaining viral suppression has critical benefits for their
health and for reducing the risk of transmitting HIV to others. Viral suppression is thus a critical cornerstone of
the US program to end HIV. However, over a third of people in the US living with HIV do not have a
suppressed viral load. Some groups, including younger people and Black people, have lower levels of viral
suppression. Although transfeminine people (TFP) have shown rates of viral suppression comparable to other
groups, there is ample evidence that they experience a multitude of barriers to sustaining viral suppression,
including multiple forms of stigma and structural barriers to accessing culturally appropriate care. In addition,
there are wide racial disparities in HIV care among transgender communities, with Black TFP experiencing
some of the lowest levels of viral suppression.
A deep understanding if required of the circumstances that surround gaining, sustaining or losing viral
suppression. Most research to date has focused on individual factors associated with viral suppression status.
This approach is limited in that it restricts the consideration of the causes of lack of viral suppression to
individual characteristics or behaviors, and misses the broader contexts – stigma, discrimination, lack of health
coverage, distance to healthcare providers, and structural racism – that shape the risk of PLWH for losing viral
suppression. Further, understanding these multilevel predicators of loss of viral suppression is required to
develop interventions that are responsive to the circumstances that shape risks for remaining or becoming
unsuppressed.
Thus, we propose to enroll and follow a cohort of PLWH – both MSM and TFP – to observe the patterns of
gaining, sustaining or losing viral suppression, and to develop information that can be used to inform the
development of new interventions to support ongoing engagement in HIV care and viral suppression. Drawing
on over a decade of experience in recruiting and retaining sexual and gender minority people in limited-
interaction research studies, we will develop nuanced data about the unique factors that shape viral
suppression or lack thereof in different critical groups, including Black MSM and TFP, and younger MSM, that
are inequitably impacted by lack of viral suppression."
10912482,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Degenerative cerebellar diseases are a group of disorders that cause severe disability and can be fatal. There
are currently no known disease-modifying treatments available for use, and there is a critical need to find
treatments that slow disease progression and allow affected individuals to live more functional lives. Balance
and aerobic training show promise as treatments for degenerative cerebellar diseases, but the neural effects of
both training methods have not been thoroughly investigated. It is crucial to understand how the training
impacts the brain, and particularly the cerebellum, in order to determine if one training method is better at
slowing disease progression than the other.
The goal of this proposal is to compare the neural effects of balance versus aerobic training in individuals with
degenerative cerebellar diseases. We hypothesize that aerobic training causes neuroplastic changes within the
cerebellum whereas balance training causes improvements for people with cerebellar degeneration by
impacting brain structures outside the cerebellum. If our hypothesis is true, aerobic training may have more
influence on disease progression than balance training as it directly impacts the cerebellum.
To investigate our hypothesis, various neuroimaging techniques will be used, which will allow the candidate to
gain invaluable expertise in processing and analyzing brain scans. In AIM 1, we will compare cerebellar
volume before and after the participants perform either 6-months of balance or aerobic training. In AIM 2, we
will investigate whether neural changes have clinical significance by correlating cerebellar volume changes
with clinical measures of ataxia. Finally, for AIM 3, we will use diffusion tensor imaging and resting state fMRI
scans to examine how both training methods impact cerebellar microstructure and functional cerebellar
connections. We hope that a detailed understanding of how each training method impacts the cerebellum will
lead to more targeted training regimens with the goal of slowing disease progression of these devastating
diseases.
The candidate has a clinical background in Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation with an emphasis on
movement disorders. He has a PhD in immunology and will be completing a master’s degree in clinical
research design and statistical analysis. He is committed to a career in ataxia research focusing on the effects
of exercise training on disease progression and plans to use the additional training he receives through this
NIH Career Development Award to support his future work in this field. The candidate has assembled a
multidisciplinary mentoring team to accomplish three training goals: 1) to learn and master neuroimaging
techniques; 2) to become proficient in longitudinal statistical methods; 3) to improve grantsmanship skills to
facilitate ongoing research support. In addition, the candidate will receive further training in career development
and the responsible conduct of research."
10909980,"Summary
 Ultrasonic imaging is the most widely used advanced imaging modality in the United States, and excluding
planar radiography, it represents 44% of all imaging studies. Unfortunately, ultrasound images are often subopti-
mal, and some echocardiography studies show degradation in up to 98% of patients. This rate of degradation and
the freehand nature of clinical ultrasound means that image quality is more dependent on operator skill than other
advanced modalities, but even with the most skilled practitioners, ultrasound completely fails in 11-64% of clinical
tasks. Our overall goal for this application is to fundamentally decrease ultrasound failure rates. Low-quality
ultrasound is particularly problematic in echocardiography because of its role as a ﬁrst-line tool for diagnosing
and monitoring cardiac disease. When transthoracic echo is inadequate more costly and time-consuming exams
like transesophageal echo or MRI are required. To (1) facilitate the high volumes of transthoracic echo, (2) im-
prove patient comfort and safety (i.e. reduce transesophageal echo), (3) reduce cost and procedure time, and (4)
maximize physician efﬁciency, it is crucial to have consistently high quality transthoracic echo. To provide this, we
introduce new acquisition and reconstruction solutions for ultrasound imaging.
 Echocardiographic imaging of the left atrial appendage is growing in importance in lockstep with the rising
incidence of atrial ﬁbrillation, which currently effects as many as 2-6 million Americans and is expected to grow
to 6-12 million by 2050. In patients with atrial ﬁbrillation, thrombus may appear in as many as 12-26% of left
atria with most appearing in the appendage. Therefore, in patients with current atrial ﬁbrillation the left atrial
appendage must be screened with echocardiography for thrombus before cardioversion can be performed to
return the heart to sinus rhythm. Further, patients receiving a left atrial appendage closure device due to chronic
atrial ﬁbrillation require annual transesophageal echo follow ups to monitor the device. For both cases, the gold-
standard and standard-of-care is transesophageal echocardiography, and while the left atrial appendage can be
visualized transthoracically, is is rarely used because the image quality is considered too unreliable.
 Ultrasound image quality is degraded by both clutter and thermal noise, so to make clinically transforma-
tional improvements to ultrasound–and echocardiography speciﬁcally–it is necessary to address both the clutter
problem and the noise problem. Addressing both of these issues is becoming increasingly important because
recent developments in beamforming have focused on non-linear algorithms (including deep networks), and the
performance of these methods are more strongly linked to the noise level compared to conventional beamforming
methods. To this end, we introduce both a solution enhancing signal-to-noise ratio using coded excitation and a
comprehensive solution for clutter reduction using deep network beamforming."

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a leading cause of death in the United States. Risk stratification for acute PE
treatment can reduce mortality. Risk scoring systems use clinical and laboratory electronic medical record
(EMR) data. In addition, biomarkers on computed tomography imaging can identify which patients with PE are
at high risk of death, independent of clinical data. Despite advances in clinical and image-driven scoring
systems, improving outcomes in acute PE depends on implementation of patient-specific EMR and imaging
data analytic prognostic models at the point of care.
The promise of digital medicine stems in part from the hope that by digitizing health data, we can leverage
computer information systems to understand and improve care. A method that can make use of these data to
predict patient-specific outcomes could not only provide major benefits for patient safety and healthcare quality
but also reduce healthcare costs. Unfortunately, most of this information is not yet included in predictive
statistical models that clinicians use to improve care delivery. This is because traditional computational
methods and techniques are insufficient at accurately analyzing such high volumes of heterogeneous data.
The goal of this proposal is to develop an automated precision medicine approach to achieve point-of-care risk
stratification for PE patient outcomes using a fusion deep learning strategy that can simultaneously analyze
health records and imaging data. An ideal PE risk-scoring system would not only predict mortality, but also
assess the risk for the many debilitating long-term consequences of acute PE. Such a system would,
therefore, facilitate optimal management and would likely require intelligent use of clinical, laboratory, and
imaging data together in order to provide accurate patient -specific risk scoring for multiple PE outcome
measures. In order to build a robust model, we propose to apply distributed training of deep learning models
across four large US healthcare institutions. By distributing the algorithm rather than the data, we avoid
sharing individually identifiable patient information. If successful, this project will be the first endeavor to
leverage diagnostic imaging (pixel) data in combination with structured and unstructured EMR data to predict
outcomes.
We have the ideal research team, experience, and methods to develop an automated risk-scoring system for
acute PE patients. Using a powerful combination of clinical, laboratory, and imaging data, this system will
provide patient-specific risk scoring for multiple PE outcome measures. Further, this project will foster multi-
center collaborations, which will afford us the opportunity to investigate the generalizability of our approach to
different populations of PE patients and to train, test, and ultimately deploy our automated predictive model in
a variety of clinical environments."

Abstract:
 The goal of this proposal is to identify molecular interactions relevant to drug targeting and chemical
signaling in living cells. A critical bottleneck in the development of drugs is the identification of off-target effects.
Methods that can identify the molecular interactions associated with proteins recognizing and binding to drug
candidates in cellular and other live models can be used to understand and minimize unwanted side effects
and complications. Identifying these effects at earlier stages of drug screening is important to avoid late stage
drug failure. We are developing technologies that take advantage of the plasmonic properties of metallic
nanoparticles to enable chemical-specific spectroscopic studies of ligand-receptor binding in living cells. These
investigations will provide new approaches to probing the receptor’s chemical residues that bind peptide
antagonists and provide insights into molecular interactions that regulate the proteins involved in signaling and
drug targeting.
 Our approach combines enhanced Raman scattering from both nanoparticles (Surface enhanced Raman
scattering, or SERS) and scanning probes (tip enhanced Raman scattering, or TERS), nanoparticle tracking
microscopy, non-standard applications of static and dynamic quantum chemical calculations, and super-
resolution SERS imaging to characterize chemical interactions that regulate binding to protein receptors.
Information present in the enhanced Raman scattered response provides molecular level detail of the
interactions governing recognition by the protein. In concert, our methodologies provide a new approach to
monitoring protein binding to putative drugs in living cells, and to characterize targeting specificity.
The specific aims of this proposal are:
 1) Screen the targeting specificity of peptide-functionalized nanoparticles in live cells.
 2) Develop super-resolution SERS imaging to improve binding specificity studies and identify
 particle location in cells.
 3) Combine non-standard quantum and numerical simulations with experiments to identify key
 motifs in amino acid conformation related to peptide binding.
Overall, the technology and platform we propose will address the challenge of obtaining chemical information
from ligands binding to receptor proteins in intact cells. These studies will provide new insights into the
molecular interactions that regulate signaling pathways and how anomalies in these interactions are
associated with disease and treatment."
10898848,"Children with developmental language disorder (DLD; also referred to was children with specific
language impairment) experience a significant deficit in language ability that is longstanding and
harmful to the children’s academic, social, and eventual economic well-being. Word learning is
one of the principal weaknesses in these children. This project focuses on the word learning
abilities of four- and five-year-old children with DLD in an effort to understand the nature of
these difficulties. The goal of the project is to build on our work accomplished in the first five
years to determine whether, as we have found thus far, special benefits accrue when these
children must frequently recall newly introduced words during the course of learning. The
planned studies seek to increase the children’s absolute levels of learning while maintaining the
advantage that repeated retrieval holds over comparison methods of learning. We also adapt
our learning procedures to an illustrated storybook format to promote children’s engagement
with the materials to be learned. Finally, we will determine if our repeated retrieval procedures
continue to prove superior when the words to be learned move from the single-word level to
appearing in sentences from the outset. Of special interest will be whether repeated retrieval
activities narrow the differences between children with DLD and their typically developing peers
relative to other word learning procedures. If the planned studies reveal larger word learning
gains than current methods, repeated retrieval activities can serve as the basis for the
development of new methods of treatment for children with word learning difficulties."

Recent advances in therapeutics have improved survival rates for many cancers. However, nearly all
metastatic tumors are incurable, and resistance to therapeutic interventions is nearly universal. There are
many reasons for our lack of progress-foremost of which is lack of understanding of mechanisms of response
and resistance and lack of markers to identify subsets of patients ideally-suited for specific treatments.
Our team brings enormous experience in TCGA and other multi-disciplinary coordinated projects, such as
BEAT-AML, and the Stand Up to Cancer West Coast Prostate Cancer Dream Team. The Cancer Genome
Atlas (TCGA) was successful because multi-disciplinary teams worked together to create new and innovative
knowledge about cancer and we intend to ensure that the GDAN is equally successful. In this application, we
have assembled a team of proven investigators from four of the different TCGA groups to extend the
successes of TCGA to the projects managed by the Center for Cancer Genomics. Our team will continue our
outstanding capabilities at analyzing and interpreting cancer genomic data by deploying data analysis pipelines
that support the key capabilities of the network.
In addition to the our experience in coordinated network studies, we bring experience with clinical trial design
and interpretation. Further, the team has deep expertise at building the computational infrastructure necessary
for the GDAN to succeed. For example, in the domain of distributed computing we have deploy pipelines for
execution at many sites. We also bring novel methods for integrative pathways and analysis. Finally, we bring
our experiences with competitive challenges that ensure that we can identify and deploy the most effective
methods for genomic data analyses.
Using these strengths we will support the GDAN and the Analysis Working Groups (AWGs) that it serves with
two principal objectives. The first objective and second objective, per the RFA, are the “Development of
innovative bioinformatics and computational tools and methodologies”, which will allow us to make clinical and
biological correlations and to “Conduct Integrative analysis of data sets generated by GCCs using the
bioinformatics tools developed by each GDAC.” We will achieve these objectives in five specific aims, one
administrative aim to support the GDAN and four aims, one for each of the areas where we propose a
competency."
10917181,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Few therapeutic options exist for patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and no FDA
approved drugs are available for the most common subtype, dry AMD. Longitudinal imaging studies have
identified the accumulation of drusen near the fovea as the single greatest anatomic risk factor for progression
to severe disease, suggesting that loss of lipid homeostasis in the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) and
choroid is a critical disease mechanism underlying AMD. Moreover, histologic and molecular studies have shown
that inflammation of the macular RPE/choroid is an early, unifying feature of AMD. Yet, the molecular and cellular
mechanisms responsible for the accumulation of lipid and inflammation in the RPE/choroid remain poorly
understood. Using publicly available bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing data from 150 human donors, we
demonstrate that choroidal macrophages—a critical component of the choroidal ecosystem required for
maintenance of the choriocapillaris and RPE function—are decreased and dysfunctional in the macular
RPE/choroid in AMD. We detail novel transcriptomic observations related to the molecular underpinnings of
choroidal macrophages in humans, demonstrating that they are robustly anti-inflammatory and express several
key modules involved in lipid clearance. Of note is the expression of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid
cells 2 (TREM2), a liporeceptor that mediates lipid homeostasis and immunosuppression in a range of tissues
and is lost in several diseases involving accumulation of extracellular material. Using choroidal tissue from mice,
we employ a variety of techniques to validate key findings related to choroidal macrophages. We show that
choroidal macrophages are important in maintaining lipid homeostasis in the choroid during times of chronic lipid
challenge, as these cells expand and contain nearly all of the excess lipid after 9 weeks of high-fat diet. These
findings led us to our core hypothesis that TREM2+ choroidal macrophages modulate lipid homeostasis in the
RPE/choroid and suppress inflammation and choroidal neovascularization. We propose two Aims using TREM2
knock-out mice to interrogate the role of TREM2 signaling in choroidal macrophages with respect to lipid
metabolism and immune and neovascular suppression in the RPE/choroid. We anticipate the findings from this
proposal will expand our understanding of the role of choroidal macrophages in the choroidal ecosystem and will
identify TREM2 as a novel drug target in AMD.

The mammalian paraoxonase (PON) family consists of three highly conserved members (PON1,
PON2 and PON3) with unique anti-oxidative and anti-atherosclerotic properties. PON1 and 2
have been implicated in blood pressure (BP) regulation. While the role of PON3 in regulating BP
has not been investigated, it is expressed in the aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron where the
fine tuning of Na+ absorption and K+ secretion occurs. PONs share key structural and functional
features with MEC-6, an endoplasmic reticulum-resident chaperone of C. elegans. MEC-6 is
required for proper folding, assembly, and surface expression of the mechanosensitive degenerin
channel in touch receptor neurons. The chaperon function is conserved between mammalian
PONs and C. elegans MEC-6. We have previously shown that both PON2 and PON3 regulate
functional expression of the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC), a member of the ENaC/degenerin
family of ion channels. ENaC mediates the rate-limiting step of Na+ reabsorption in distal nephron
and has a key role in volume and BP control. While the constitutive K+ secretion is conducted by
the renal outer medullary K+ (ROMK) channels, ENaC-dependent and flow-induced K+ secretion
is mediated by the large conductance K+ (BK) channels. In the preliminary studies, we found that
Pon3 KO mice have higher ENaC activity and enhanced amiloride-sensitive natriuresis,
suggesting ENaC functional expression is upregulated in the absence of PON3. In addition, we
have identified BK channel as a novel target of PON3. When expressed in HEK293 cells, PON3
interacted with BK α subunit to reduce its surface expression and channel activity. Our proposed
studies will define mechanisms by which PON3 functions as a chaperone in the regulation of
ENaC and BK expression. We will determine the consequences of deleting PON3 in renal Na+
and K+ handling and BP control in mice. Successful completion our proposed studies will enhance
our understanding of the mechanisms by which PONs function as chaperones and their
physiological roles in kidney function and BP control."
10900815,"The CDC's Essentials for Parenting Toddlers and Preschoolers program (EFP) is a free Internet resource
with the potential to break down barriers to population-wide access to scientifically-based parenting interven-
tions. Our research team at NYU recently partnered with program developers and researchers at the CDC and
Westat (a research firm) to evaluate EFP. We learned three important lessons from the pilot study: (1) EFP is
well-liked by the parents who use it; (2) parents consume more intervention content if cued what content to
use and when to use it; yet (3) the amount of content consumed, even with such guidance, is highly variable
and tends to be quite limited. In short, EFP has considerable promise, but parental engagement, a major issue
in the success of universal parenting interventions, remains a challenge. Thus, learning how to maximize
meaningful parent engagement is the lynchpin to realizing the promise of EFP.
 The objective of the proposed research is to optimize EFP by identifying engagement-fo-
cused intervention elements to add to EFP that enhance its effects on parenting skills. The study
is based on the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) developed by Dr. Linda Collins (Co-I) and collabora-
tors. The bedrock logic of MOST is that only after an intervention has been optimized to meet specific criteria,
should it be evaluated in an RCT. In our view, improvements in parenting skills are the key optimization crite-
ria that must be met. The study is a longitudinal factorial optimization trial in a community sample of 800
parents with 1.5- to 3-year-old children. There are 4 experimental factors; each corresponds to the presence vs.
absence of an engagement-focused intervention element. This experiment enables the estimation of the indi-
vidual and combined effects of each element. The specific aims follow.
 Aim 1: Optimize the effects of EFP on parenting skills by determining which combination of the four ex-
perimental engagement-focused intervention elements results in the greatest success of EFP, as reflected in
increasing parent warmth and reducing corporal punishment, overreactive and lax discipline.
 Aim 2: Determine the extent to which boosted meaningful parent engagement in EFP is the mechanism
driving the effects of the four engagement-focused intervention elements on parenting skills, and which as-
pect(s) of engagement (e.g., content consumption; behavioral skills practice) are the key mediators that trans-
late the effects of the four engagement-focused intervention elements into improved parenting.
 Aim 3: Examine parent (e.g., change readiness; race) and child characteristics (e.g., externalizing behavior;
sex) to determine if the optimal intervention package differs among subgroups. Cracking the code of providing
parents with an intervention that they actually use, and that improves parenting, could have far-reaching ef-
fects (e.g., improving population-level child outcomes)."

evaluation model. The evaluation addresses 3 specific aims: Aim 1) Assess the effectiveness of the GP
IDeA-CTR in creating the environment and culture to support innovative and collaborative clinical and
translational research; Aim 2) Evaluate how GP IDeA-CTR programs, resources, and services affect scientific
productivity and the movement of research across the translational spectrum, with a focus on short- and long-
term goals, milestone attainment, budget effectiveness, and leveraging data for informed decisions, strategic
planning, and continuous improvement; and Aim 3) Use T&E feedback across teams and the network to
improve collaborative team science, in a model that provides stakeholders with actionable metrics to assess
GP IDeA-CTR outcomes, impact, and benefits to the community and region. The evaluation process uses
cutting-edge, validated approaches and 14 evaluation metrics that include several tools with established

10934326,"ABSTRACT
The most widely used and most general-purpose knowledgebases in biomedicine are the ontologies that
define the entities and the relationships that are central to different aspects of health care or the life sciences.
When ontologies are brought together in an integrated framework—enabling terms denoting the same or
similar entities to be related to one another and allowing computational infrastructure to operate across
ontologies—then the aggregate collection of ontologies provides additional capabilities for users.
Our group has developed an enormously popular knowledge resource, known as BioPortal, that provides a
unique knowledgebase of nearly all the world’s publicly accessible biomedical ontologies. Adoption of BioPortal
has been remarkable. Each month, more than 75,000 unique users from academia, government, and industry
access the contents of our ontology repository, and our API services more than 16 million requests. At least
7,850 scientific papers mention the use of BioPortal, according to Google Scholar.
We propose the following four specific aims: (1) We will continue to govern and maintain the BioPortal
knowledgebase by enhancing the services that the knowledgebase provides to the biomedical community. (2)
We will improve the efficiency with which users interact with the knowledgebase by creating the BioPortal
Knowledge Graph. The graph—which will be a queryable knowledge resource in its own right—will integrate all
ontologies in the knowledgebase and it will provide links to other knowledge sources, allowing users to perform
expanded queries across all ontologies. (3) We will enable users of BioPortal to make requests for changes or
extensions to ontologies, and to view the history of changes and change requests when ontologies are
managed in Git repositories. The result will be a much more efficient workflow for making suggestions to
ontology developers and the ability to monitor the change history of component ontologies to inform ontology
selection for particular end-user tasks. (4) We will provide enhanced mechanisms to enable users of BioPortal
to search, access, and browse knowledge in remote BioPortal servers. Users no longer will need to know in
advance where particular knowledge might be stored and they will have the ability to easily integrate
knowledge from complementary scientific disciplines stored across a network of servers.
The result will be the world’s most widely accessed knowledgebase of biomedical concepts and relationships—
supporting all other work in semantic technology in biomedicine and making all biomedical knowledgebases
more standardized, more easily integrated, and more FAIR."
10917358,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall goal of this application is to support a NIDDK Mentored Research Scientist Development Award
(K01) for the applicant, Dr. Victoria Weis, PhD, at the intersection of epithelial cell biology, pediatric intestinal
disease, and novel translational therapeutics to study necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a devastating intestinal
disease affecting the most fragile premature infants. There are no effective therapies currently available and
mortality rates persist at 20-40%. As the population of premature infants at highest risk for NEC continues to rise
due to overall improvements in NICU care, an urgent need has emerged to develop innovative clinically
translatable therapies to combat this disease. Despite decades of research targeted at uncovering the risk factors
and mechanisms for onset of NEC, the field has not progressed to the point of clinically available therapies. We
posit that a critical barrier preventing the development of clinically translatable therapeutic candidates is the lack
of understanding in the remedial dynamic mechanisms involved in NEC repair and epithelial restitution. Our
group has recently shown promising results with the use of perinatal stem cells isolated from placental tissue in
facilitating the reparative process through regulation of the inflammatory response and re-establishment of the
intestinal stem cell niche and epithelial barrier. We hypothesize that the dual supportive role of placental stem
cells on immune modulation and epithelial regeneration will enable us to uncover the dynamic mechanisms
responsible for initiating intestinal repair in NEC, to guide further efforts in advanced therapeutic development.
The specific aims of this application reflect a rigorous study of the mechanisms and time-course involved in
placental stem cell attenuation of NEC to examine: (1) reparative cellular and molecular dynamics in in vivo NEC
intestinal damage and (2) direct therapeutic effects specifically on NEC damaged epithelium in vitro with targeted
translation into human NEC disease. In addition, a comprehensive career development plan has been developed
that supports Dr. Weis’s continued scientific growth and transition into an independent investigator studying
pediatric intestinal disease models to identify, characterize, and translate novel therapeutics. An expert
multidisciplinary committee across the fields of novel translational stem cell therapy, in vitro organ/disease
modeling, advanced imaging and analysis, gastroenterology, and neonatology have been assembled and will
provide guidance for Dr. Weis’s career trajectory. This career development plan supplements Dr. Weis’s existing
skill-set and expertise in gastrointestinal cell biology and development/characterization of animal disease models
with advanced didactic coursework, mentoring in new skills, and laboratory training in in vitro model systems,
novel therapeutics, and translational research. Combined with mentoring and advising in other essential skills
(e.g. grant writing, budgeting, personnel management), this career development award will ensure successful
transition into independence as a uniquely trained investigator in translational aspects of pediatric intestinal
diseases, enabling Dr. Weis to make important impacts early in her career as an independent investigator."
10910873,"PROJECT SUMMARY CORE B
Lower respiratory tract infections cause nearly 80% of deaths from infectious diseases in the US, and respiratory
viruses, such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2, are increasingly recognized as common causes of severe
community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). As mortality from severe CAP persists despite appropriate
antimicrobial treatment and clearance of the causative pathogen, Program Project Investigators hypothesize
that mortality and persistent organ failure in severe viral CAP represent persistent inflammatory injury and a
failure of lung repair mechanisms. Persistent inflammation and unrepaired organ damage drive poor long-term
outcomes following severe CAP, and biomarkers suggest that patients with poor outcomes from severe CAP
have a persistent pro-inflammatory state despite clearance of the presumed pathogen. Core B will allow Project
Investigators to validate findings from causal murine and cell models of influenza pneumonia in patients with
severe CAP induced by viral pathogens. The major goal of Core B is to provide serial bronchoalveolar
lavage (BAL) samples obtained from well-phenotyped patients with severe influenza and SARS-CoV-2
pneumonia to the Project Investigators, as defined in the following Specific Aims: 1) Provide BAL fluid
from intubated patients with influenza and SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia for a) flow cytometry-sorted BAL alveolar
immune cell subsets for transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis and b) cell-free supernatant fluid for
metabolomic and biomarker/protein analyses. 2) Define the microbiologic milieu at each BAL sampling time
point regarding a) the presence of viral pathogens (viral PCR), b) the presence of bacterial co-infection (culture
and PCR), and c) microbiome alterations. 3) Apply robust clinical phenotypes and relevant clinical endpoints.
Core B will leverage the existing infrastructure of the Successful Clinical Response In Pneumonia Therapy
(SCRIPT) Systems Biology Center at Northwestern University and its rigorous published protocols for flow
cytometry sorting of alveolar immune cell populations, microbiologic analysis, and clinical phenotyping.
Ultimately, the goal of this PPG is to define immune system pathways and mechanisms of failed resolution and
repair following influenza and SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia that are amenable to therapeutic interventions. Core B
is integral to supporting this goal by demonstrating strong clinical correlations to findings from the proposed
murine models."

generate stocks of influenza (A/WSN/33) virus, titrate and maintain viral stocks, and perform infection of the
experimental animals as outlined in Projects 1, 2, 3 and 4. Quantitative tools such as Flexivent measurements
of lung mechanics, quantitative histological assessment, flow cytometric phenotyping and sorting of the
immune cellular populations, and multiplex measures of pro-inflammatory cytokines will be conducted by Core

tissue-resident and recruited alveolar macrophages, perivascular and peribronchial interstitial macrophages,
monocyte subsets, dendritic cell subsets, T, B and NK cell subsets, alveolar epithelial type II cells, fibroblast
subsets, endothelial cells) from the murine lung and lymphoid organs. The sorting and isolation capabilities of
the Core will allow cell-type-specific assessment of transcriptomic response via RNA-sequencing, including
single-cell RNA-sequencing. To this matter, Core will provide automated DNA/RNA isolation from sorted cells,
followed by quality assessment and RNA-sequencing library construction and sequencing. Core C will breed
mice to generate the cell-type- or tissue-specific Cre recombinase lines to induce tissue-specific knockout
mice. Core C will perform the genotyping of all the murine strains proposed by Project Leaders. Core C will
maintain a uniform environment in which wild-type and genetically engineered mice will be maintained,
subjected to lung injury and allowed to recover. Collectively, these tools provide a unique resource for Project
Investigators, which would be difficult to reproduce without the support of this PPG."
10910886,"PROJECT SUMMARY PROJECT 1
Severe viral pneumonia, due to influenza A virus (IAV) damages the lower respiratory tract to cause acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The persistence of respiratory failure in patients with ARDS is a
consequence of persistent inflammation and the failure of normal mechanisms of inflammation resolution and
lung tissue repair. A crucial step in the immune response to IAV is the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome
and subsequent secretion of inflammatory cytokines, IL-1β and IL-18.
Vimentin regulates the formation and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. We propose to modulate the NLRP3 inflammasome by temporally deleting vimentin in monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages (MoAMs) post-viral clearance in IAV-infected mice.
MoAMs play crucial roles in both initiation and continuation of the immune response, limiting repair of the injured
lung tissue. Our data revealed that genes driving the inflammatory phenotype are suppressed in Vimentin−/−
MoAMs. Using novel lineage-tracing techniques in inducible conditional knockout mice, we will investigate
whether vimentin regulates persistent inflammation by promoting an inflammatory phenotype in MoAMs following
clearance of IAV. Regulatory T cells also contribute to recovery from viral pneumonia by suppressing immune
responses and promoting lung tissue repair. Our data suggest that Vimentin−/− Treg cells exhibit a cell-
autonomous increase in their pro-repair function following IAV infection. We hypothesize that a targeted loss
of vimentin in alveolar macrophages and regulatory T cells is required to promote pro-repair processes
following severe IAV infection.
Specific Aim 1. To determine whether a targeted loss of vimentin in monocyte-derived alveolar
macrophages suppresses their inflammatory response and promotes lung repair following severe
influenza infection. We propose to disrupt the persistent inflammation that limits repair of injured lung tissue by
temporally-controlled deletion of vimentin in monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages post-viral clearance in IAV-
infected mice.
Specific Aim 2. To determine whether depolymerization of vimentin intermediate filaments causes
metabolic reprogramming to suppress alveolar macrophage inflammatory phenotype. Our preliminary
data suggest that a switch from inflammatory to pro-repair macrophage phenotype is associated with metabolic
reprogramming and depolymerization of vimentin intermediate filaments.
Specific Aim 3. To determine whether temporal, cell-specific loss of vimentin augments the pro-repair
function of regulatory T cells during recovery from IAV-induced pneumonia. We propose to determine
whether Vimentin−/− Treg cells exhibit their augmented cell-autonomous pro-repair function via increased
adenosine signaling and amphiregulin production following influenza A virus infection."
10910889,"Project summary
Viral pneumonia is currently among the most common causes of death in the world. Viral pneumonia impairs
tissue repair leading to both in-hospital death and prolonged hospital-acquired disability. Understanding and
targeting mechanisms that impair tissue repair after viral pneumonia therefore offers promise to both improve
survival and prevent multiple organ morbidity after hospital discharge. In this Project and PPG, we hypothesize
that ongoing inflammation after the influenza A virus (IAV) is cleared precludes proper lung repair. The cytosolic
NOD-like receptor protein-3 (NLRP3)-dependent inflammasome complex initiates production of mature forms of
the inflammatory cytokines IL-1 and IL18, inducing recruitment of effector cells to the site of infection that are
essential to clearance of the influenza A virus. In addition, inflammasome activation within the monocyte derived
alveolar macrophages participates in the ongoing inflammation observed in patients after influenza A virus
clearance. Mitochondria have been proposed to be key regulators of NRLP3 dependent inflammasome
activation. Our preliminary data demonstrate that inhibition of mitochondrial complex I or III as well as
administration of sodium lactate, which does not alter the pH, attenuates inflammasome activation. Furthermore,
our preliminary data indicate that monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages upon influenza infection display an
increase in mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) mRNA, which diminishes pyruvate conversion into lactate by
lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA). We will test whether inflammasome dependent inflammation post-viral
clearance in mice requires mitochondrial complexes I and III as well as lactate production in monocyte-derived
alveolar macrophages using conditional knockout mice. Collectively these hypotheses will be tested in three
interrelated Specific Aims: (1) Is mitochondrial complex I generated ROS required for influenza A induced
NLRP3-dependent inflammasome activation in monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages? (2) Is mitochondrial
complex III produced ROS necessary for influenza A induced NLRP3-dependent inflammasome activation in
monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages? (3) Does in vivo lactate production decrease NLRP3-dependent
inflammasome activation following influenza A virus infection in monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages."
10910892,"In this PPG, all of the Projects and Cores consider the persistence of respiratory failure and the development of
multiple organ dysfunction in patients with ARDS as a failure of normal mechanisms of inflammation resolution
and lung repair. This hypothesis is clinically supported by a recent analysis of patients enrolled in the ARDSnet
where a “hyerinflammatory” endotype of ARDS was associated with poor clinical outcomes including death. The
expression of many genes encoding inflammatory cytokines is regulated by the transcription factor NF-B.
Hence, understanding how NF-B activity is controlled over the course of lung injury and repair is likely to provide
mechanistic insights into the pathobiology of successful or failed lung repair after injury.
The Linear Ubiquitin Assembly Complex (LUBAC) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that performs Met-1 ubiquitination
necessary for NF-B activation. In preliminary experiments, we observed that epithelial specific deletion of a
modulatory component of LUBAC (HOIL-1L) prevents NF-B signaling and improves outcomes in a murine
model of influenza A virus infection. We present additional preliminary data that support our hypothesis that
LUBAC promotes persistent NF-B signaling in the alveolar epithelium and monocyte-derived alveolar
macrophages to inhibit lung repair after influenza A induced lung injury.
Specific Aim 1. To determine whether inhibiting LUBAC-mediated NF-B activation in the lung epithelium
during recovery from influenza A infection accelerates lung repair. We will perform timed experiments in
which we will genetically inhibit LUBAC mediated NF-B signaling during recovery from influenza A infection and
use complementary physiologic and molecular techniques to measure lung repair.
Specific Aim 2. To determine whether activation of LUBAC mediated NF-B activation in the lung
epithelium directs reparative phenotypes in monocyte-derived macrophages. We will determine whether
the inflammatory phenotype of these cells is driven by the changing microenvironment—specifically the lung
epithelium, or whether these changes are cell autonomous within the macrophage.
Specific Aim 3. To determine whether increased expression of NF-B-dependent inflammatory genes in
alveolar macrophages and BAL fluid from patients with severe pneumonia is associated with 30 day
mortality. We will take advantage of the infrastructure provided by the Successful Clinical Response in
Pneumonia Therapy (SCRIPT) trial to determine whether there is an association between the expression of NF-
B target genes in alveolar macrophages and BAL fluid cytokines with clinical outcomes."
10910896,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – ESI-LED PROJECT 4
Influenza and COVID-19 exert a disproportionate impact on older patients. Influenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2
cause severe viral pneumonia, injuring the lung to induce the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), for
which anti-viral therapies have limited efficacy and ICU interventions remain supportive. Older patients with virus-
induced ARDS experience slow recovery, leading to protracted ICU stays that often herald the compounding
multi-morbidity and functional limitation observed among elderly survivors of severe respiratory infection. We
reason that activation of youthful resolution and repair pathways in older patients with severe viral pneumonia
will potentiate recovery to extend the health-span of older ICU survivors. CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells
coordinate resolution and repair following experimental acute lung injury. These cells appear in the alveolar
spaces of patients with ARDS and display epigenetic and transcriptional signatures predicted by murine
experiments. In contrast with young mice, Treg cells from aged mice exhibit a cell-autonomous impairment in
pro-recovery function following influenza and fail to upregulate the epithelial growth factor amphiregulin.
Mechanistically, epigenetic alterations in DNA methylation signatures represent a hallmark aging process that
modulates Treg cell function, and Treg cells from aged mice and mice with genomic instability-induced premature
aging display a striking DNA hypermethylation signature compared with Treg cells from young mice. DNA
methyltransferase (DNMT) activity and the DNMT adapter Uhrf1 mediate DNA methylation signatures in Treg
cells, but whether these factors induce DNA hypermethylation in Treg cells during normal and genomic instability-
induced aging to impair Treg cell pro-recovery function following viral pneumonia in aged hosts remains
unknown. We hypothesize that DNMT activity and Uhrf1 induce DNA hypermethylation in Treg cells during
aging to impair Treg cell reparative function following severe viral pneumonia in older hosts. We propose
three Specific Aims, which use cutting-edge murine systems, a translational human case-control study, and novel
computational platforms to test our hypothesis. Aim 1 will reveal whether DNMT activity or Uhrf1 is necessary
to induce DNA hypermethylation in Treg cells during aging. In Aim 2 we will determine whether transient loss of
DNMT activity or Uhrf1 in Treg cells during recovery from influenza restores the transcriptional programs and
amphiregulin-dependent function present in youth but lost with aging. Aim 3 will elucidate the association
between age, alveolar Treg cell DNA methylation signature, and 30-day mortality in selected patients with severe
influenza A or COVID-19 viral pneumonia. Our proposal will establish causal evidence linking drug-targetable
mechanisms to detailed physiologic readouts. Elucidating these causal links will enable the development of pro-
recovery therapeutic approaches for severe influenza, COVID-19, and other causes of ARDS in older patients."

Human genes are arranged on 23 pairs of chromosomes, but in cancer, tumour-promoting genes can free themselves from chromosomes and relocate to circular, extrachromosomal pieces of DNA (ecDNA). These ecDNA do not follow the normal “rules” of chromosomal inheritance, enabling tumours to achieve far higher levels of cancer-causing oncogenes than would otherwise be possible, and licensing cancers with a way to evolve and change their genomes to evade treatments at rates that would be unthinkable for human cells. The altered circular architecture of ecDNAs also changes the way that the cancer-causing genes are regulated and expressed, further contributing to aggressive tumour growth. These unique features make ecDNA-containing cancers especially aggressive and difficult to treat. Cancer patients whose tumours harbour ecDNA have markedly shorter survival. Despite being first seen over fifty years ago, the critical importance of ecDNA has only recently come to light, and the scale of the problem is substantial. ecDNAs are present in nearly half of all human cancer types and potentially up-to a third of all cancer patients. The collective current understanding of how ecDNA form, how they function, how they move around the cell, how they evolve to resist treatment, how they impact the immune system, and how they can be effectively targeted are lacking. We bring together an internationally recognized, pioneering interdisciplinary team of cancer biologists, geneticists, computer scientists, evolutionary biologists, mathematicians, clinicians, and patient advocates to boldly create novel insights and resources and to provide transformative solutions to one of Cancer’s Grand Challenges. A core team of experienced and productive ecDNA investigators will work with new investigators in the ecDNA and cancer fields to bring completely new perspectives and approaches to this daunting challenge. By bridging cutting-edge and diverse approaches and insights from cancer genomics, yeast genetics, epigenomics, artificial genome synthesis, longitudinal patient tracking, combinatorial and machine learning algorithms, mathematical modelling, immunobiology, and innovative chemistry we will develop a new understanding of the role of ecDNA in cancer, and we will find new ways to drug the undruggable. This bold programme, which consists of 7 work packages and a committed international infrastructure, generates new and unusual collaborations that would simply be impossible under any other type of funding mechanism.

11124966,"Background
Cancer cachexia (CC) is a systemic, metabolic wasting syndrome featuring body weight loss due to skeletal muscle and adipose tissue wasting. CC is suffered by ~80% of cancer patients that causes reduced performance status, intolerance to chemotherapy, and increased mortality. This debilitating condition is poorly understood and has no effective treatment. If CC therapy existed, it would improve treatment responses, increase quality of life, and prolong survival. With 50 years of study, the field has focused on defining pathways that promote atrophy in the end-organs most affected by cachexia. While this work has been fruitful, it has not led to identification of the upstream mediators of CC, nor has it generated effective therapies. There is an urgent need for high-quality discovery science and more detailed clinical phenotyping. We have created a virtual institute comprised of diverse, international, multidisciplinary scientists and clinicians with expertise in cancer, metabolism, neuroendocrine function, immunology, human metabolic diseases, preclinical models, and clinical phenotyping. We hypothesize that CC is driven by tumor-intrinsic factors that activate neurohormonal sickness pathways, which then induce anorexia, metabolic dysfunction, and tissue atrophy.
Methods
Our approach involves sophisticated measures of host-tumor interactions including innovative investigation of (1) systemic metabolic flux in mice using isotope tracing, imaging mass spectroscopy, dynamic nuclear imaging, and dietary and pharmacologic interventions; (2) cellular components and secreted factors from the tumor microenvironment using imaging mass cytometry, patient-derived organoid xenografts, microbial toxins, and CRISPR-based manipulations; (3) central pathways regulating appetite, behavior, and peripheral organ metabolism using human metabolic phenotyping, optogenetic, and pharmacological methods. We will perform the largest, most comprehensive observational study in CC subjects to thoroughly define CC subtypes and their clinical biomarkers using epidemiologic tools, novel image segmentation algorithms, and cluster analyses.
Project Goals
Our vision is to develop mechanistically informed treatments for cancer cachexia (CC) to improve quality of life and life expectancy for patients. Working as a multidisciplinary team with expertise in basic science, clinical research, and epidemiology, we will establish a therapeutically relevant classification of molecular and clinical subtypes of CC. We will build therapies to normalize metabolism and neuroendocrine dysregulation in CC to enable successful anti-cancer treatment and systemic recovery for patients. In 5 years, we will have laid the foundation for a new generation of CC treatment trials and strategies that will, for the first time, deliver practice-changing evidence for improved outcomes for patients with cancer who are at risk of or suffer from CC."
11124967,"Next Generation T cell therapies for childhood cancers [NexTGen] 
Current treatments fail to cure many children with solid cancers. Recent advances in adult cancers such as checkpoint blockade and targeted small molecules have made little impact in childhood disease. Engineered T-cell therapies can achieve durable responses in refractory lymphoid cancers without long-term toxicity. These are precisely the characteristics required for new treatments for pediatric solid cancers. In contrast to hematologic malignancies, solid cancers are challenging due to a lack of targets, tumor heterogeneity, and hostile tumor microenvironment (TME). We posit that through advanced cellular engineering we can overcome these challenges. Our vision is that engineered T-cell therapy for childhood solid cancers will become routine within a decade. Our central hypothesis is that coupling of advanced cellular engineering along with progressive clinical development is the fastest route to developing effective T-cell therapies for pediatric solid tumors. In NexTGen, we combine detailed studies of primary tumors to discover new targets and understand how the TME subverts T- cell function. This, along with a closely coupled clinical development program will guide the progressive engineering of T-cells to result in transformative therapies. NexTGen is composed of 6 inter-connected work-packages (WPs) with work initially focused on pediatric sarcomas and brain tumors. AIMS: WP1: To identify suitable targets for engineered T-cells. WP2: To understand the TME in pediatric solid cancers. WP3: To develop receptors and other engineering components which target tumor cells and resist or modulate the TME. WP4: To evaluate the function of engineered T-cells developed in WP3. WP5: To translate approaches from WP4 and test them in clinical studies designed for maximal impact. Cancer Grand Challenges - Full Application - 2021 WP6: To promote data sharing across all WPs. METHODS: Target discovery (WP1) and TME studies (WP2) will utilize mass spectroscopy and chip cytometry respectively. Component engineering (WP3) will use protein engineering methods. To model engineered cell function, WP4 will mostly use intact tumor models such as immune PDXs. In WP5, clinical product generation will involve autologous closed system semi-automated manufacturing. WP6 uses standard and custom databases and data sharing platforms. USE OF RESULTS: Tumor target and TME data from WP1 and 2 will be uploaded to databases developed by WP6 for widespread distribution. Engineering components from WP3 and functional data from WP4 will be available for incorporation into therapeutic T-cell strategies by the entire community. Clinical study data from WP5 should lead to registration studies, improving cure rates and mitigation of long-term toxicity to realize our Vision."
11124968,"The cancer research community is on the verge of a major leap in our understanding of the factors that contribute to human cancer risk. While it is clear that mutations in DNA, either spontaneous or environmentally induced, are essential for cancer development, recent advances have highlighted the importance of non-mutagenic factors as rate-limiting determinants of cancer risk in human populations and in mouse cancer models. 
The root causes of human cancer have been widely debated, but most of the emphasis has been on the origins of the “driver” mutations that are ubiquitous in human tumours. Although epidemiology studies have highlighted the possible roles of lifestyle factors such as obesity, alcohol consumption, inflammation and poor diet in cancer risk, it has generally been assumed that these factors act directly or indirectly to cause mutations in DNA, thus contributing to tumour mutational burden and resulting in increased cancer risk. In contrast, recent sequencing studies have uncovered abundant mutations in normal human tissues, suggesting that even strong cancer driver mutations are not sufficient for cancer formation. These results were presaged by studies of mouse tumour models, some carried out more than 50 years ago, showing that promotion is the rate-limiting step in tumour development.
To identify the mechanisms that control mutated normal cells, and to elucidate the precise mechanisms by which promoting factors stimulate the conversion of these cells to neoplastic growth, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team of investigators with wide-ranging experience in epidemiology, genetics, computational network analysis and machine learning, tissue imaging of gene expression, single cell transcriptomics, and genome-wide CRISPR functional screens. We will focus human analysis on a unique collection of several thousand human normal and matched tumour samples from >20 countries, including regions of both high and low cancer risk. Detailed risk factor information and whole genome sequence data is available from all these samples as part of the Grand Challenge Mutographs study. Analysis of these samples, together with detailed intervention studies in human populations, mouse models and human organoids, will allow us to develop a roadmap of tumour promotion from single normal cells carrying driver mutations, through to malignant progression. Our findings will facilitate identification of the causative environmental factors that promote cancer and provide routes to new methods and approaches to cancer prevention based on a deeper understanding of the process of initiated cell selection by tumour promoting agents."

10929421,"Novel therapeutic approaches are desperately needed in an expanding patient population to improve
both the survival and quality of life for patients with or susceptible to heart failure. Research over the last two
decades has established p90 ribosomal S6 kinase type 3 (RSK3) as a pivotal regulator of pathological cardiac
remodeling, including in mouse models of pressure overload and genetic cardiomyopathy. RSK3 is required for
pathological remodeling even though RSK3 is less abundant in the cardiac myocyte than other members of the
RSK protein kinase family. The efficiency and specificity of intracellular signal transduction can be enhanced by
the anchoring and co-localization of key enzymes and their upstream activators and substrate effectors by
scaffold proteins. RSK3’s unique N-terminal domain confers high affinity binding to the scaffold protein muscle
A-kinase anchoring protein β (mAKAPβ) in the cardiac myocyte. Recently published data show that blockade of
RSK3 association with mAKAPβ by adeno-associated virus (AAV) mediated expression of the mAKAPβ-derived
RSK3 Binding Domain (RBD) anchoring disruptor polypeptide will inhibit the development of pathological
remodeling and heart failure during chronic pressure overload in the mouse. Newer data demonstrate that RBD
expression will also prevent remodeling following myocardial infarction (MI) in the mouse. Cardiac RSK3
Inhibitors, LLC (CRI Biotech) is a company developing patent-protected therapeutics targeting cardiac myocyte
mAKAPβ signalosomes for the prevention and/or treatment of heart failure. To target mAKAPβ-RSK3-dependent
signaling via blockade of the mAKAPβ-RSK3 protein-protein interaction, CRI Biotech proposes to treat patients
at risk for heart failure with the new self-complementary, serotype 9 AAV gene therapy vector AAV9sc.RBD. As
a dose sufficient to deliver AAV9sc.RBD with high penetrance to the swine myocardium has been determined,
CRI Biotech will now test in this Direct to Phase II SBIR project the efficacy of AAV9sc.RBD in a clinically relevant
swine model of ischemic cardiomyopathy. Specific Aim 1: Efficacy of RSK3 anchoring disruptor peptide for
post-myocardial infarction heart failure in a large animal model. The core of this project is to test whether
RBD peptide expression will reduce pathological remodeling induced by MI in swine, preventing heart failure.
Swine will be subjected to ischemia-reperfusion injury to induce MI and then treated immediately afterwards with
AAV9sc.RBD by antegrade intracoronary infusion. Cardiac function will be assessed serially for 12 weeks post-
MI. Specific Aim 2: AAV9sc.RBD-mediated inhibition of the molecular and cellular pathology associated
with heart failure. Taking advantage of tissue collected from the same animals used in Specific Aim 1, the
benefits of the RBD anchoring disruptor biologic in swine will be further demonstrated by gravimetric, histological,
and molecular analyses for fibrosis and other markers of cardiac remodeling and heart failure. In addition, initial
toxicology screens will be done to test AAV9sc.RBD safety."
10932870,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a prevalent and disabling neurodevelopmental disorder that takes a
significant toll on patients, their families, and the national economy. There are no targeted treatments for the
dysregulated autonomic responses, or dysautonomia, that affect and disable over 70% of autistic children. Most
current medical approaches are non-selective, ineffective, and associated with side effects. Thus, a novel and
targeted therapy is urgently needed for refractory dysautonomia in ASD. Given dysautonomia is thought to arise
from a problem in how the brain regulates peripheral autonomic organs, a major barrier to progress has been an
incomplete understanding of the neural networks that influence peripheral autonomic output. Recently, I
identified the sites of the cerebellum that are major sources of descending control over the adrenal medulla, an
autonomic organ that releases adrenaline and initiates the body-wide sympathetic response. Cerebellar
involvement is clinically relevant because dysautonomia and cerebellar abnormalities are both present in ASD
and the superficial location of the cerebellum makes it an attractive target for non-invasive trans-cranial magnetic
stimulation (TMS). Yet, two remaining knowledge gaps prevent clinical translation: we do not know which sites
of the ‘autonomic cerebellum’ influence the physiologic responses perturbed in dysautonomia and how these
sites are affected in conditions like ASD where dysautonomia and cerebellar abnormalities are present. The
goals of this project are to fill these gaps by defining the regions of the autonomic cerebellum that selectively
control physiologic responses and by testing how these cerebellar networks are altered in a model of autism.
Specifically, Aim 1 is to test if modulating the adrenal-related cerebellum alters autonomic physiologic
responses. Aim 2 is to test if autonomic responses are abnormal in a marmoset model of ASD. Aim 3 is to test
if the cerebellar sites that control the adrenal’s sympathetic output are altered in a marmoset model of ASD. I
will employ in vivo recording of autonomic physiologic responses and trans-neuronal transport of rabies virus to
establish the behavioral and systems neuroscience foundations for how the autonomic cerebellum is affected in
ASD. These studies have the potential to identify specific cerebellar regions to target with a new treatment
approach (e.g., cerebellar TMS) that aims to normalize refractory dysautonomia in ASD. Thus, the results of the
proposed work may ultimately transform how we manage dysautonomia in ASD and other disorders associated
with cerebellar abnormalities."
10887593,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Apicomplexan parasites cause persistent mortality and morbidity worldwide through diseases like malaria,
toxoplasmosis, and cryptosporidiosis. The phylum member Toxoplasma gondii alone infects approximately
one third of the world population. The pathogenesis of T. gondii is reliant on its capacity to replicate within
host cells and spread to other host cells. The acute infection is ultimately controlled by the host immune
response and the parasite establishes a chronic infection characterized by the presence of tissue cysts
containing slow replicating bradyzoites. Tissue cyst rupture releases bradyzoites that convert into tachyzoites
that replicate fast and if the host is immunocompromised, could cause severe and even fatal tissue damage.
 We propose to study how polyphosphate (polyP), a “forgotten molecule”, exerts its role in pathogenicity
and virulence of T. gondii. PolyP is a ubiquitous polymer of three to hundreds of phosphate residues linked
by high-energy phosphoanhydride bonds and can reach millimolar levels in protozoan parasites, while the
concentration in host cells is at the micromolar level. T. gondii stores polyP at molar levels in acidocalcisomes
which are hydrolyzed upon alkalinization followed by release of Ca2+ into the cytosol. It is puzzling how little
is known about the function of polyP in the T. gondii infection cycle and/or virulence. However, characterizing
how polyP functions will impact our knowledge of the mechanism by which T. gondii causes disease.
 Both in bacteria and eukaryotes polyP is involved in a large number of diverse and apparently unrelated
functions. However, these apparently unrelated functions may be the result of polyP’s ability to interact with
proteins either electrostatically or covalently and we propose to test this for T. gondii. Our hypothesis is that
polyP exerts its essential function in the lytic cycle of T. gondii through its interaction with proteins
and/or their covalent modification by polyphosphorylation.
 We propose two strategies to determine how polyP exerts its role in virulence. To define candidate proteins
that interact with polyP we will use Thermal Proteome Profiling and expose intact parasites and/or lysates to
heat stress to underscore the role of polyP as a protein-like chaperone. We will also use a bioinformatics
approach to discover potential proteins that are covalently modified by polyP. We propose to use polyP
mutants (that do not make polyP) already available for the characterization of the role of polyP interaction with
target proteins. The synthesis of polyP represents a novel target as it is essential, and the enzymes are absent
in the mammalian host. The proteins involved in polyP synthesis are conserved in other apicomplexan
parasites. The polyP target proteins will be specific for T. gondii virulence pathways and could have orthologs
in other apicomplexans. Additionally, findings from this project could have wider impact for vertebrate biology
since the mammalian polyP synthesis machinery is unknown and our findings may uncover novel functions
and proteins."
10828914,"Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying decision-making is important because patients with many
psychiatric disorders make mal-adaptive decisions, impacting executive functioning, including emotion and mood
regulation. Historically, the mechanisms underlying decision-making have been most studied using behavioral
paradigms in which subjects repeatedly make decisions about well-controlled stimuli or options, invoking
perceptual, valuation, memory, or other processes. These studies have provided significant insight, but many if
not most decisions in the real world occur in very different circumstances than those realized in the laboratory.
Two paradigmatic types of such decisions are those made in novel situations never encountered before, and
those that require subjects to generate new responses to familiar stimuli, i.e. to flexibly adjust behavior in a new
way. In this grant, we test the hypothesis that mechanisms underlying these 2 forms of decision-making can be
revealed by examining the 'geometry' of neural representations and relating them to behavior in tasks invoking
the 2 types of decisions. The geometry of a representation is defined by the set of all distances between points
in the activity space that represent responses of multiple neurons in different conditions. Measures of a
representational geometry include assessment of its dimensionality. Decisions in novel situations require
generalizing from past experiences to a new one, an ability relying on abstraction. Abstraction constructs
variables describing features shared by instances within and across situations, capturing regularities and
structure in the world. Neural representations of abstracted variables are similar to the widely studied
disentangled representations in machine learning and have lower dimensionality. On the other hand, high
dimensional neural representations support the ability to generate many different responses without changing
the underlying representation. Recent data indicate that neural ensembles in the hippocampus (HPC) and
prefrontal cortex (PFC) achieve geometries with a sufficiently low dimensional ‘scaffold’ to support generalization
in new situations, but the scaffold is embedded in a higher dimensional representation of task variables. This
geometry has specific computational capabilities, but do they actually relate to decision-making? Here we
combine high-channel count electrophysiology, neural network modeling, and carefully designed tasks to provide
evidence for the first time that these 2 aspects of the geometry actually are used to support the 2 distinct types
of decision-making. We examine the geometry of representations in HPC and PFC in relation to decisions of
both types. We ask if the ability to make decisions relying on abstraction correlates with how a key task-relevant
variable is represented in a low-dimensional scaffold (Aim 1). Then we test if the representation encodes many
other variables with higher dimensionality, and if this predicts the ability to learn to generate new responses (Aim
2). Finally, we train neural network models on the same tasks to elucidate neural coding principles in HPC and
PFC, and interactions between areas mediating these 2 forms of decision-making (Aim 3)."

Accumulating evidence has identified nucleus accumbens astrocytes as salient targets of drug abuse. For
example, numerous studies indicate that rat self-administration of multiple drug classes results in impaired
glutamate homeostasis, as well as decreased structural features and synaptic colocalization of nucleus
accumbens astrocytes. Preliminary data for this proposal reveal that male rat accumbens astrocytes exhibit
striking (~40%) reductions in surface area, volume, and synaptic colocalization 45 days after 10 days of long-
access (6h/d) cocaine self-administration. These findings suggest loss of physiological function of astrocytes
as regulators of neural circuits. However, the mechanism(s) driving these observations are unknown, as are
the consequences to neural function. We hypothesize that astrocyte pathology underscores the neural
adaptations and increased measures of craving observed across prolonged abstinence (also known as
incubation). Accordingly, the goal of this proposal is to define the relationship between cocaine self-
administration and the onset of astrocyte dysfunction in the nucleus accumbens, as well as the relationship
between astrocyte dysfunction, synaptic transmission, and behavior. Aim 1 will assess the effects of operant
cocaine self-administration on evoked Ca2+ responses in accumbens astrocytes as a function of both self-
administration and abstinence, and will determine the functional significance of astrocyte Ca2+ to cocaine
seeking behaviors. Aim 2 will examine how cocaine self-administration affects the ability of astrocytes to
negatively regulate excitatory synaptic transmission in D1 and D2 receptor-positive medium spiny neurons.
Lastly, Aim 3 will establish the role of dopamine and G protein-mediated astrocyte signaling in the pathological
effects of cocaine on accumbens astrocyte structure. For each aim, we will evaluate endpoints as a function of
time across abstinence. These objectives will collectively be accomplished by leveraging a multimodal
approach that spans cellular physiology to circuit analysis and animal behavior, combining rat cocaine self-
administration with high-resolution imaging of fluorescently-labeled astrocytes, acute slice imaging of Ca2+-
labeled astrocytes using a photoconvertible Ca2+ indicator (astro-CaMPARI2), astrocyte DREADD stimulation,
astrocyte Ca2+ depletion using an astrocyte-expressed PMCA2 Ca2+ pump, whole cell patch-clamp
electrophysiology, neuronal subtype-specific analyses using Drd1a-Cre and Drd2-Cre transgenic rats, and
fluorescent imaging of an adenosine biosensor GRABAdo. Collectively, these studies will define the relationship
between astrocyte dysfunction across abstinence from cocaine self-administration with neural physiology and
behavior."

Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that plays a role in many aspects of hearing, including selective attention,
learning, frequency selectivity, sound localization, and discrimination of speech sounds. It also plays a critical
role in helping the brain adapt during normal development, during aging and in response to damage of the ear
or central nervous system. Top-down modulation, in which higher brain centers modify early acoustic
processing, contributes to many of these functions, often through interactions with cholinergic pathways. A
long-term goal of this research is to understand how cholinergic inputs modulate brainstem auditory processing
and how projections from auditory cortex contribute to these functions. The present proposal will address four
main gaps in our knowledge that limit our understanding of cholinergic function in the auditory brainstem. The
first gap in our knowledge is lack of information on sources of cholinergic input to most brainstem auditory
nuclei. Aim 1 will identify these sources by using recently developed viral vectors in newly created transgenic
mice. A second gap concerns divergent projections from individual cholinergic cells. Modulatory cells in other
brain areas typically have branching axons to allow widespread modulation. Aim 2 will use multi-label tracing in
transgenic mice to identify divergent circuits that could support concurrent modulation of large expanses of the
auditory brainstem. A third gap is a nearly total lack of information on cholinergic receptor types associated
with specific brainstem circuits. Numerous receptor types occur in the subcortical auditory system, suggesting
a variety of short- and long-term effects. Aim 3 will combine anatomical tract tracing with fluorescent in situ
hybridization (FISH) to identify specific cholinergic receptor components associated with particular ascending
and descending auditory circuits. The fourth gap in our knowledge concerns the identity of brainstem
cholinergic circuits that are directly contacted by projections from the auditory cortex. Aim 4 will use
conventional tracers as well as trans-synaptic intersectional viral methods in transgenic animals to test the
hypothesis that cortical projections contact cholinergic cells that innervate many subcortical auditory nuclei.
These results will identify the cholinergic circuits that are responsible for cortically-driven release of
acetylcholine. Overall, the results from the four Aims will provide fundamental information about brainstem
cholinergic circuits, their targets within the auditory pathway, and the extent to which they may be activated by
projections from higher brain centers. This information is essential for the design and interpretation of future
experiments to understand cholinergic and top-down modulation and for insight into therapeutic approaches to
prevent or treat deficits associated with dysfunction of these systems."

Increasing numbers of chemicals that enter our daily lives through their use in agricultural,
industrial, and consumer products are now known to have unexpected and, in many cases, very
surprising abilities to interfere with numerous endocrine-regulated systems in humans and other
organisms. Over the past few decades, research on these endocrine-disrupting chemicals
(EDCs) has developed into a field that spans areas ranging from human biomonitoring and
epidemiology to experimental investigations of reproductive, behavioral and metabolic
consequences in model systems to predictive chemistry, green chemistry, and environmental
remediation. The breadth of expertise needed to understand what EDCs do, both alone and in
more environmentally complex exposures, is enormous and compounded by the clinical and
regulatory issues raised by EDCs. The complexity of the field creates significant barriers both to
individual research programs and in the development of cross-disciplinary collaborative
research initiatives necessary to address important questions in a rapidly developing field. Most
institutional training programs with EDC components focus, understandably, on just a subset of
these areas. What is lacking is the opportunity for scientists to step away from their home
programs and immerse themselves in an intensive short course that grounds them in the range
of integrative questions and approaches essential for both for the advancement of their careers
and of the field as a whole.
Taking advantage of the unique facilities at the Marine Biology Laboratory (MBL) in Woods
Hole, MA, we plan to offer such a course, one that is open to advanced graduate students,
postdocs and independent scientists from across the country. This two-week course, Endocrine-
Disrupting Chemicals: Hazards and Opportunities (ECHO), will use a combined
lecture/lab/modeling/discussion approach intended to complement and enhance participants'
research programs by providing them with access to advances in fundamental concepts and
approaches, along with emerging strategies for assessing the hazards posed by EDC
exposures. The course also will provide sessions on effective communication skills, and
guidance on interactions with both the general public and the media. Finally, it will enhance
networks for collaborative, cross-disciplinary relationships at all levels."

DUB Biologics is developing a therapeutic for the prevention and treatment of corneal scarring through
knockdown of a novel target that has been shown to be central to the fibrotic response leading to corneal
opacification. Corneal opacification severely impairs the vision of 4.2 million people around the world, 5.1% of
the total blind population. Monocular scarring is far more common, affecting 3x as many people. Scarring in the
cornea resulting from injury, trauma, or infection can lead to debilitating opacities and permanent vision loss.
Treatments to prevent scarring include corticosteroids however, they have unpredictable results and cause well-
established adverse events that include cataracts and glaucoma. Once opacification occurs, it is most often
irreversible and the only option for patients are corneal transplants. However, only 1 in every 80 corneas needed
for transplant are available. Therefore, preventing opacification is of utmost importance. DUB Biologics has
identified a novel scarring pathway in the cornea, central to which is the deubiquitinase USP10. USP10 activity
in the cornea following injury can be modulated through knockdown of USP10 with a self-delivery siRNA
(sdRNA). DUB Biologics’ drug is a fully modified sdRNA conjugated to a cholesterol moiety that does not need
encapsulation for delivery. USP10-targeting sdRNA (sdUSP10) is effectively delivered to the cornea via eye
drops. Additionally, sdUSP10 is resistant to nucleases, is not immunogenic, and demonstrates in vivo efficacy
for months after a single treatment. Previous work has focused on mechanistic studies using human primary
corneal stromal fibroblasts, corneal stromal wound healing models in mice and rabbits, and ex vivo pig organ
culture. This Direct to Phase II SBIR project will advance sdUSP10 towards market launch through expansion of
efficacy studies that will focus on persistence epithelial defect (PED) models in mice and rabbits and in human
corneal organ culture. Based on comparable therapeutics in the ocular space, these will contribute significantly
to the animal efficacy studies needed before first-in-human trials. In preparation for IND filing, the project will
also support the demonstration of scaled-up production of human sdUSP10 in a GLP environment. The
production runs will be used to conduct IND-enabling studies including toxicology and PK experiments in rabbits.
At the conclusion of the project, DUB Biologics will have completed all required efficacy studies, created a scaled-
up manufacturing process that is ready for cGMP conversion, and demonstrated the safety profile of sdUSP10.
This will validate the technical viability of pursuing this therapeutic pipeline, enabling external investment to fund
the remaining IND-enabling studies and conduct early-stage clinical trials. Creating a way to prevent PED and
corneal scarring safely and effectively will improve the quality of life of millions of patients around the world and
reduce the economic burden of corneal opacification and demand for corneal transplants."

People living with HIV (PLHIV) are more likely to use tobacco than the general population. PLHIV who use
tobacco have higher mortality rates and risk for co-morbidities including diseases caused by tobacco, when
compared to PLHIV who do not use tobacco. Sub-Saharan African continues to be the epicenter of HIV
infection while experiencing an increase in tobacco consumption. There is evidence that PLHIV in Africa are
more likely to use tobacco than the general population. Kenya is an example of a country coping with the dual
epidemic of HIV and tobacco, with an estimated 1.5 million PLHIV and 2.5 million tobacco users. HIV remains
one of the country's leading causes of morbidity and mortality, with an estimated 46,000 adults acquired HIV
and 25,000 persons died of HIV in 2018. Tobacco use among the general population is estimated to be 11.6%
(19.1% among men and 4.5% among women). The impact of tobacco use among PLHIV in Kenya has yet to
be fully understood. There have been no research or initiatives in Kenya to support PLHIV to quit tobacco use
in a primary care setting, a gap that this proposal seeks to address. In 2017, Kenya's Ministry of Health
launched the National Guidelines for Tobacco Dependence Treatment and Cessation. This project will
evaluate integration of the Guidelines' interventions into HIV care clinics through the Family AIDS Care &
Education Services (FACES). FACES is a 16 years-partnership between the Kenya Medical Research
Institute, the University of California San Francisco and the Kisumu County Ministry of Health. FACES have
tested over 1.5 million people for HIV, diagnosing over 21,000 people, and currently serves over 51,000 PLHIV
on ART in 61 sites in Kisumu County. We will conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial at 20 FACES-
supported clinics, recruiting 580 patients to compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an intensive
(Nicotine Replacement Therapy and Bupropion, 12 sessions of behavioral counseling through in-person and
telemedicine approaches (telephone and texts), and provision of a quitline number) versus a brief (one-time
counseling plus the quitline number) intervention. We hypothesize that 15% of intensive intervention group
participants will achieve biochemically verified 7-day Point Prevalence Abstinence at 12 months compared to
the brief intervention group quit rate of 5%. We will offer the intensive intervention to brief intervention group
participants who continue to use tobacco at 12 months. Prior to the trial we will conduct a formative evaluation
to tailor the Guidelines to PLHIV and after the trail we will assess assessing barriers to and facilitators of
adoption, implementation, and factors associated with scalability/sustainability of the intervention. The
proposed study will determine the most cost-effective strategy to integrate tobacco use cessation within HIV
care in a community health setting. The project's results will inform policies to scale up tobacco dependence
treatment within HIV primary care centers across the country and serve as a model for the region."
10839787,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Currently 14.5 million people suffer from alcohol use disorder (AUD) in the United States. Identifying early risk
factors that increase the likelihood of developing AUD could help elucidate potential models for preventative
care and mitigate the impact AUD has on society. One highly studied risk factor associated with developing
AUD is early life stress (ELS). The mechanisms that facilitate ELS's impact on the development of AUD is
poorly understood. One consistent finding in ELS literature shows a role of microglia in the development of a
host of neurological disorders including AUD. Over the past several years, new evidence has been uncovered
identifying a role of microglia in the development and maintenance of AUD. To expand this field of work and
discover novel targets for treatment, my project seeks to implement a model of early life stress: periadolescent
social stress (PSS) and a model to promote voluntary binge-like consumption of ethanol: drinking in the dark.
Using these models, I will identify how microglia respond to these factors in isolation and when combined. Over
the past two years, I have run experiments to optimize the PSS paradigm and drinking in the dark protocol. I
have performed immunohistochemical staining and run qPCR to determine how microglia respond to these
stimuli. I have found that combined PSS and binge ethanol consumption decrease microglia number, increase
microglial reactivity, and alter microglia morphology in the ventral hippocampus. In addition, markers related to
homeostasis are reduced following PSS and binge ethanol consumption. While these results are interesting,
evidence suggest that microglia are present heterogeneously throughout the brain and serve a variety of
functions. To better characterize the effects of early life stress and ethanol consumption on microglia function,
my proposal aims to identify key regions that demonstrate alterations in microglia count, reactivity, and
phenotype; and identify how these changes relate to changes in microglial RNA. To determine these key
regions, I will use light sheet microscopy. This approach will provide us an opportunity to create an unbiased
3D reconstruction of the whole brain with single microglia resolution. I will use this technique to identify how
microglia are distributed throughout the brain and phenotypically altered due to these environmental
exposures. Focusing on the regions identified with light sheet microscopy, I will perform targeted purification of
polysomal mRNA sequencing (TRAP-seq). Using a CX3CR1CreER transgenic mouse line that primarily labels
for microglia in GFP, I will sort microglia from other cell types and identify changes in microglial RNA
expression due to PSS and ethanol exposure. Following each of these main experiments, I will determine
whether microglia inhibition during PSS will prevent changes in binge-like ethanol consumption and microglial
adaptations. This work will mark a significant advancement in the field and will call for the consideration of
microglia function as a target for treatment of ELS and prevention of AUD."

Negative experiences influence everyone's daily lives by altering emotional states, decision making, and
motivated behavior. For those with substance abuse disorders attempting to remain abstinent, such experiences
are clinically relevant as they are often described as a primary trigger to relapse. Similarly, negative experiences
can trigger or exacerbate mood disorders such as depression. In order to develop ways to protect against the
detrimental impact of these negative experiences, it is critical to understand the neural mechanisms by which
aversive stimuli affect motivation. Decades of research has shown the nucleus accumbens (NAc) to be a key
region for affective processes to impact behavior. Thus, it is important to understand how negative experiences
affect mesolimbic dopamine signaling and the impact that has on motivated behaviors. Research from our lab
suggests that aversive stimuli promote drug-taking and also decrease nucleus accumbens dopamine. The
central hypothesis in this proposal is that negative experiences reduce mesoaccumbens dopamine and that it is
this reduction which causes the increased motivated behavior we have seen following exposure to aversive
stimuli.
Aim 1 will test the necessity and sufficiency of aversion-induced dopamine changes to alter escape behavior.
Preliminary data from our lab show that rats will perform an operant response to terminate an aversive white
noise. I will use optogenetics to manipulate dopamine release to both mimic and counteract the typical white
noise-induced reduction in dopamine. Aim 2 will test the necessity and sufficiency of aversion-induced dopamine
reductions to alter drug-taking behavior. Our preliminary data show that white noise both reduces dopamine and
increases drug-taking. This experiment will leverage chemogenetics and photometry to both manipulate and
measure dopamine release during drug self-administration. Aim 3 will test the impact of prior chronic variable
stress on the sensitivity to aversive stimuli. I will use photometry to characterize naturally occurring dopamine
levels following chronic stress, then test if chronic stress also changes the sensitivity to aversive stimuli in a
punishment paradigm.
I am confident that the training and mentorship of Drs. Robert Wheeler, Marieke Gilmartin, and John Mantsch
throughout the research and training aspects of this fellowship will expand on my experimental skills to
successfully complete the proposed research, as well as gain professional skills that will equip me for a
postdoctoral position. This fellowship will thus help me achieve my ultimate goal to develop an independent
research program at an academic institution that also permits me to engage in regular teaching responsibilities."
11061186,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Heart failure represents a major cause of illness and mortality in the United States. Preemptive and preventative
care are the most effective methods for mitigating the severity of this disease. Thus, the early detection of heart
failure is critical to patient prognosis and overall cardiovascular health. The conventional methods for diagnosis
are limited to detection of significant cardiac damage and pathological remodeling. We propose using 2-
[18F]fluoropropionic acid ([18F]FPA) to image the metabolic alterations in fatty acid metabolism which precede
cardiac injury. [18F]FPA-PET is favorably suited for imaging these events and translation to the clinic as: 1)
[18F]FPA-PET has been used for imaging tumors in humans and accumulates in the heart, thereby confirming
its safety and favorable dosimetry, 2) short chain fatty acids, such as [18F]FPA, are preferentially taken up by the
injured heart in response to the impairment in long chain fatty acid oxidation, 3) propionic acid metabolism is
restricted to a single mitochondrial pathway which targets [18F]FPA to this organelle and limits its potential for
degradation. We predict the metabolic alterations that occur during heart failure effectively increase the uptake
and sequestration of [18F]FPA to the myocardium. The metabolic trapping of [18F]FPA is driven by acetyl-CoA
synthetase short chain family 1 (ACSS1), which converts these short chain fatty acids to metabolically active
and membrane impermeable CoA intermediates. ACSS1 expression and activity are upregulated in patients
experiencing heart failure, and many animal models of heart failure. Thus, we hypothesize that [18F]FPA
effectively accumulates in the injured heart and can be applied to image the early manifestations of cardiac
disease which precede irreversible cardiac injury and remodeling. The goals of this fellowship project are to 1)
determine if [18F]FPA can be used to image heart failure, and 2) investigate the role of ACSS1 in accounting for
the cardiac accumulation of [18F]FPA. The successful application of most imaging probes depends on a
comprehensive understanding of the biochemical pathways that these probes report on. In building our
understanding, we can develop precise applications for these tracers to image heart failure, as well as other
disease states. The long-term goals of this project will serve as a foundation for the applicant's independent
research career. These will be facilitated by the technical, conceptual, and practical knowledge that he will gain
over the course of the fellowship training."

Several pathogens utilize morphological changes to improve their fitness in a particular environment, but these
changes often coincide with broad physiological reprogramming. Mycobacteroides abscessus (MAB) is one such
pathogen, presenting as a smooth colony (MABS) in the environment and host, which can transition to a rough
(MABR) morphotype following an unknown stimulus during infection. MAB is an emerging pathogen among
immunocompromised and immunocompetent individuals causing a wide variety of infections, including
respiratory, skin abscesses, soft tissue infection, and bacteremia. Several groups have shown that these two
colony morphotypes are phenotypically distinct in vitro and in the host, yet the underlying genetic components
contributing to their behavioral differences are still unknown. We have found that MABS and MABR require unique
genes for survival indicating that they are molecularly distinct despite having a nearly identical genome. There
still remains a significant gap in knowledge in the molecular genetic mechanisms underlying physiology that
controls the phenotypic differences. To address this, in Aim 1, I will use transposon insertion (Tn-seq) libraries
in both MABS and MABR to examine genes required for survival in a murine abscess model and seven infection
relevant conditions (e.g., low oxygen, nitric oxide, metal limitation, abscess infection). The data gathered from
individual infection relevant conditions will then be leveraged to determine which antimicrobial mechanisms the
two morphotypes face in the host and if they use similar pathways to respond. I have already generated an
ordered transposon library which will allow us to confirm our findings of select mutants. In Aim 2, I will investigate
uniquely essential genes, MAB_2726c (unique to MABS) and MAB_3329c (unique to MABR) by assaying survival
following knocked down with CRISPRi. These genes are transcriptional regulators which likely have broad
effects; therefore, I will define their regulome using CHiPSeq and confirm our findings using RNAseq following
repression by CRISPRi and controlling for differences in growth using a chemostat. I hypothesize that M.
abscessus MABS and MABR have different essential genes when exposed to stress, during infection, and
differential essentiality of transcriptional regulators contribute to broad physiological changes that confer
phenotypic differences. Due to the lack of effective therapies and a vaccine, this fellowship aims to build a
research portfolio that will address the urgent need for further understanding of this pathogen. Tn-seq offers a
method for quick and broad identification of genes essential for survival in various environments and public
availability of the data generated not only benefits my study of MAB as a postdoc but also as an independent
scientist and the field at large."
10814790,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders, diagnosed in one
in 44 children in the United States. Sex is among the most significant risk factors for ASD, with males being three
to five times more likely than females to manifest the disorder. While epidemiological data documenting these
sex differences in autism are abundant, there is currently little understanding of the fundamental differences
between male and female biology that contribute to the sex biases in autism prevalence, severity, and clinical
presentation. Based on mounting evidence implicating i) important microglial contributions to neurodevelopment,
ii) sex-biased microglial activation in individuals with ASD, and iii) our preliminary findings regarding microglia-
specific sex-linked gene expression, this proposal is built around the central hypothesis that genetic sex
differences in microglia contribute the male bias in ASD.
Sex chromosomes may be especially important drivers of sexual dimorphism in human brain development. For
one, ASD manifests at an early age, before the puberty-associated increase in sex hormone production. Further,
progressive chromosome Y aneuploidy (e.g. XY, XYY, XYYY, XYYY) leads to incrementally increased incidence
of ASD. These observations suggest a significant role for chromosome Y for presenting ASD-related behaviors.
Yet, there is a gap in knowledge about Y-linked genes and their contribution to sex dimorphism outside the
reproductive tract and to ASD pathophysiology. Therefore, the project goal is to test the hypothesis that
increasing chromosome Y dose in human microglia in vitro (Aim 1) and in a xenotransplantation model (Aim 3)
results in microglial pathology, neuropathological defects, and ASD-associated behavioral deficits. Delineating
genome wide transcriptional disruption and genome wide reorganization (Aim 2) will further uncover how
chromosome Y-linked genes contribute to microglia-specific gene networks and expand our knowledge on Y-
linked genes associated with ASD. The long-term goal is to generate a framework for studying genetic sex
differences in microglia and their contributions to sex-biased brain development. A deeper understanding of the
contribution and molecular regulation of microglia in ASD will lay the groundwork to ultimately identify novel
potential sex-specific interventions to improve the outcomes for individuals with ASD.
The proposed research will take place in the Coufal and Glass laboratories at UC San Diego. The Coufal lab
expertise is in human induced pluripotent stem cell models of neuroimmunology, and the Glass lab has expertise
in tissue-resident macrophage gene regulation and epigenetics. Through graduate coursework, mentorship, and
hands-on learning, Celina will gain experience in stem cell modeling systems for human brain cell types and for
approaching large datasets from a quantitative perspective. These skills will be valuable for the completion of
the proposed research and for Celina’s future career as a physician-scientist."
10928108,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Age-dependent metabolic dysfunction is associated with maladaptive immune responses. Mitochondria are key
metabolic organelles that are also capable of activating innate immune signaling. Components of the
mitochondria, such as mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) itself, can trigger immune responses; however, there are
currently no known immunomodulators encoded in the mitochondrial genome. MOTS-c is a peptide encoded in
the mitochondrial genome that we previously characterized as a regulator of metabolic homeostasis during
aging. MOTS-c treatment increases lipid metabolism and prevents diet-induced obesity, fatty liver, and age-
dependent physical decline in mice. Our preliminary data indicate that MOTS-c is induced during monocyte
activation and translocates to the nucleus to regulate gene expression and reprogram the differentiation of
monocytes into macrophages. This suggests that MOTS-c has a crucial role in regulating immune function.
Because MOTS-c regulates responses to metabolic stress and modulates macrophage phenotype, I
hypothesize that MOTS-c will enhance the adaptive capacity of macrophages to maintain homeostasis
during age-related lipid stress. During age- and diet-induced metabolic dysregulation, total cholesterol and
triglyceride levels increase in tissue and in circulation. These lipids can induce maladaptive responses in
monocyte-derived macrophages that promote chronic sterile inflammation. Here, I will test 1) the role of MOTS-
c in preventing maladaptive reprogramming of monocyte-derived macrophages differentiated with lipid stress,
and 2) whether MOTS-c treatment in aged and high-fat diet fed mice prevents macrophage maladaptation and
tissue damage in the liver associated with chronic inflammation. Collectively, these experiments will test the
paradigm-shifting concept that immunity is encoded in both of our co-evolved mitonuclear genomes. This
research, if successful, has broad therapeutic applications in the treatment of age-related chronic inflammatory
diseases."

Social connections among individuals shape many health outcomes. The progression and treatment of
a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., schizophrenia) and disease states (e.g., HIV positivity)
depend on individuals' social functioning. As examples, social support systems improve adherence to
difficult treatment regimens, whereas dysfunctional social perception exacerbates the mental health
challenges of depression and anxiety. Work from our groups in the previous period of support provided
evidence for a two-stage model that separated the neural and computational processes that establish
a social context from those that guide subsequent social control. Here, we test the hypothesis that
these processes reflect the core elements necessary for social competence—how one matches
behavior to the current demands of the social environment. Social competence has been recently
advanced as a consilient, cross-species framework that explains adaptive decision making in social
situations. Moreover, perceived deficits in social competence can drive privilege, ostracism, and
systemic discrimination—each of which reinforces larger-scale health disparities. In this project, we will
determine how status in a social hierarchy influences mechanisms of decision making, manipulate
sensitivity to social hierarchies, and determine how the complexity of the social environment changes
decision processes. Our three aims rely on tightly integrated and theoretically well-motivated
experiments that use primate electrophysiology, human electrophysiology and neuroimaging, and
manipulations of brain function; that adopt parallel tasks and social context manipulations; and that
analyze behavior through common computational models. Our work builds on progress from the
previous grant cycle that demonstrates how our groups are uniquely positioned to achieve these aims."
10908281,"PROJECT SUMMARY
WNT signaling is crucial for embryonic development and adult tissue homeostasis, with aberrant signaling
resulting in developmental disorders and disease, including cancer. Although much is known, a deeper
mechanistic understanding of this signaling cascade will improve our understanding of cancer formation,
progression and metastasis, allowing for the development of more effective therapeutics. WNT/b-catenin
signaling is driven by the stabilization of the transcriptional co-activator, b-catenin. In the absence of WNT ligand,
a cytosolic destruction complex phosphorylates, ubiquitylates and degrades b-catenin. In the presence of WNT
ligand, the WNT receptors, Frizzled and LRP6, and intracellular proteins form an alternative complex called the
WNT signalosome. This results in b-catenin accumulation and activation of b-catenin target genes. Recent data
demonstrate that upon WNT ligand engagement, the signalosome is endocytosed. Although conflicting data
exist within the literature, a consensus is beginning to emerge that clathrin-dependent endocytosis of the
signalosome results in signalosome degradation. This training proposal and my thesis project is devoted to
elucidating the molecular events and dynamics of signalosome formation, stabilization and endocytosis in normal
cells and in cancer, with an emphasis on kinases. In the first half of my graduate training, I utilized a gain-of-
function screen of the kinome to identify AAK1 as a negative regulator of WNT signaling. I demonstrated that
AAK1 activates a transcription independent negative feedback loop to promote LRP6 internalization, resulting in
WNT signaling downregulation. In the course of these studies, we demonstrated that AAK1 promotes the
phosphorylation of a clathrin adapter protein, AP2M1, 8-10 hrs post-WNT3A and that AAK1 and AP2M1 interact
with the tumor suppressor, WTX. My lab previously discovered the WTX tumor suppressor as a component of
the signalosome and b-catenin destruction complex. Therefore, I will define comprehensive WNT3A and WTX-
dependent changes to the phosphoproteome by quantitative mass spectrometry and test whether WTX regulates
signalosome endocytosis via AAK1. Additionally, CSNK1g is known to regulate phosphorylation of LRP6, an
essential step for signalosome formation. CSNK1g has 3 isoforms, CSNK1g1/2/3, all identified as understudied
kinases. My preliminary data suggest each isoform functions differently to activate WNT signaling and promote
LRP6 internalization. A main focus for the remainder of my graduate work will be to functionally characterize the
role of each CSNK1g isoform in regulating WNT signaling, define comprehensive protein-protein interaction
networks and evaluate isoform specific changes to the WNT-driven phosphoproteome. Because this work is
descriptive in nature, I expect it to be submitted for publication in 14 months. To summarize, the precise role of
endocytosis in WNT signaling remains unclear, with numerous questions surrounding the mechanism(s) and
components of endocytosis and its effects on signaling. This work, and my future postdoctoral work, will provide
me training in and experience in the mechanisms of WNT signaling and feedback attenuation."

and 0.66, respectively). Preliminary data from this trial also suggest that (compared to standard training)
iLookOut improves ECPs' actual reporting of suspected abuse: i) reports are more likely to be screened-in for
investigation by child protection services (86% vs 70%, p<.001), and ii) these screened-in reports are more likely
(56% vs 34%, p=.001) to be “high yield” (ie, child abuse is identified and/or social services are recommended).
But we know that for gains to be sustained, they must be reinforced …and reinforced again. This is because newly
acquired knowledge and habits decay over time unless they are kept in use. Built into the design of our parent
study was an exploratory effort to deliver basic, ad hoc follow-up messaging to maintain awareness and promote
knowledge retention after completing iLookOut's Core training. But it was beyond the scope of the parent study
to fully develop this follow-up intervention, study its impact, or establish its optimal timing.
Through several small grants, we built a research-quality platform to deliver brief (5-10 minute) gamified micro-
learning activities that reinforce and augment what is taught in iLookOut's Core training, and provide practice
opportunities to apply what has been learned. We have piloted this micro-learning in the parent study and shown
that ECPs will complete these activities on their smart phones in return for 3 hours of (no cost) professional
development credit. This, along with strong evidence for the efficacy of iLookOut's Core training, now positions
us to systematically examine how interactive, gamified micro-learning promotes knowledge retention and fosters
behavior change (regarding child abuse and its reporting), and to establish that its implementation is feasible.
Just as rigorous research is needed to determine the optimal timing to give booster doses of vaccines to bolster
a child's immunity, it is likewise essential to understand the optimal timing for administering iLookOut's micro-
learning so as to boost ECPs' waning knowledge/preparedness to protect children from abuse. Using validated
measures, self-report, and data from state child protection services, this study will 1) measure the rate of
knowledge decay following iLookOut's Core training, 2) examine how well micro-learning activities (delivered at
variable time points) promote knowledge retention and behavior change regarding child abuse and its reporting,
and 3) establish whether iLookOut's micro-learning (as a follow-up to Core training) offers an implementation
strategy that is feasible (ie, well-accepted, appropriate to the task, and sustainable)."
10812496,"ABSTRACT
 The proposed studies focus on the role of BDNF/TrkB signaling in promoting phrenic motor neuron (PhMN)
survival and pre- and postsynaptic neuroplasticity to enhance functional recovery after cervical spinal cord injury
(cSCI). We will leverage our extensive experience using two well-established models of incomplete cSCI, i.e.,
C2 hemisection - C2SH and C4 contusion injury - C4CI to explore neuroplasticity at PhMNs. We will also bring
years of experience examining diaphragm muscle (DIAm) motor unit physiology, recognizing the importance of
PhMN size in the recruitment of DIAm motor units. Stratifying the effects of BDNF/TrkB signaling on pre- and
postsynaptic neuroplasticity in PhMNs of varying size is conceptually innovative and provides valuable
mechanistic insight. The “Size Principle” is a key concept in neuromotor control physiology, but until now it has
been difficult to directly include motor neuron size as a critical variable. We hypothesize that there are size-
dependent differences in BDNF/TrkB signaling effects on pre- and postsynaptic neuroplasticity after cSCI. The
proposed studies will provide novel information about PhMN neuroplasticity underlying functional recovery of
inspiratory and post-inspiratory DIAm activity that will inform development of novel therapeutic approaches to
enhance recovery of DIAm function in patients with incomplete cSCI.
 The proposed studies will utilize a comprehensive array of innovative techniques, many developed in our
lab. In all 3 specific aims, we will examine the effects of modulating BDNF/TrkB signaling using a gain/loss of
function approach utilizing intrathecal BDNF or TrkB-Fc treatment and a novel TrkBF616A rat with a 1NMPP1
sensitive knock-in allele that rapidly and selectively inhibits TrkB kinase activity. In Aim 1, we will use high
resolution confocal imaging to explore the role of BDNF/TrkB signaling on the recovery of Glu and Gly/GABA
presynaptic terminals on retrogradely labeled PhMNs of varying size following C2SH. In Aim 2, we will employ a
novel RNAscope in situ hybridization technique to simultaneously explore changes in NMDA, Gly and GABAA
receptor mRNA expression in PhMNs of varying size. In Aim 3, we will examine the neuroprotective effects
(PhMN survival) of BDNF/TrkB signaling following C4CI. In addition, we will examine the effect of BDNF/TrkB
signaling on Glu and Gly/GABA synaptic input and NMDA, Gly and GABAA receptor mRNA expression (pre- and
postsynaptic neuroplasticity) in surviving PhMNs above (i.e., C3) and below (i.e., C5) the C4CI injury."

The human body is constructed during through tightly orchestrated patterns of gene expression
during embryonic and postnatal development. Perturbations in gene regulation during
development are thought to be a major substrate for natural selection and have likely contributed
to the evolution of the human form. The molecular processes that contributed to sculpting human
specific features of our limbs and brains, can have deleterious consequences when a critical gene
or regulatory sequence is affected. Defective gene regulation during embryonic development can
result in a variety of structural and functional defects such as congenital heart defects, orofacial
clefting, or neurological dysfunction. In cases where a birth defect is not readily observed the
individual may be instead be predisposed to various diseases later in life including diabetes or
cancer. While our understanding of the genetic code for protein coding genes allows us to make
predictions about disease risk our limited understanding of the information encoded in the rest of
our genome prevents such predictions and causative assignments. Over the past several years
functional annotations of the genome in tissue and developmental stage specific contexts have
revealed over half a million potential regulatory elements. We and others have shown that
variants linked to diseases and phenotypes of particular tissues are enriched in regulatory
sequences that are active in those tissues or during their development. This has been particularly
fruitful for defects related to craniofacial and heart development. The work proposed aims to build
on these annotations to identify the genes that are controlled by these tissue-specific regulatory
sequences and the consequences of variation in those sequences. Using culture and organoid
models of early human cardiac development we aim to dissect the regulatory architecture that
build the heart and malfunctions in congenital heart defects."
10909198,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Acute dyspnea (shortness of breath) is one of the most common reasons for emergency department visits and
hospitalizations each year. Heart failure, pneumonia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are the most
common etiologies, representing 2.5 million hospitalizations in the US in 2017. Determining the precise cause
of acute dyspnea is critically important but challenging, as presenting symptoms, laboratory testing, and
imaging results may be difficult to interpret, particularly in the elderly and patients with comorbid disease or
severe illness. Diagnostic errors and inappropriate treatment may occur in up to 30% of patients, which is
associated with worse patient outcomes. Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools have been proposed to augment
providers in the diagnostic process and are well-positioned to support the diagnostic evaluation of acute
dyspnea. However, inaccurate AI tools can also worsen clinician performance. Therefore, simply keeping
clinicians “in-the-loop” is not a guaranteed back-stop against a poorly performing model. This proposal seeks
to enable effective Clinician-AI collaborations to improve diagnostic accuracy in acute dyspnea. We propose to:
1) evaluate computational strategies to improve the robustness of an AI tool used to support clinicians in the
diagnosis of acute dyspnea, 2) test strategies to enhance collaborations between clinicians and AI tools, 3)
prospectively evaluate an acute dyspnea AI tool in a clinical environment while evaluating strategies to collect
clinician feedback to enable ongoing model improvement. Our multidisciplinary team consisting of experts in
clinical medicine, computer vision, machine learning, and human-computer interaction are well positioned to
tackle these important challenges. Successful completion of this proposal will result in a robust, generalizable
acute dyspnea AI tool to augment physicians in the diagnostic evaluation of acute dyspnea. More broadly, the
proposal will lead to generalizable knowledge to support safer development and integration of AI tools across
healthcare settings."
10912460,"Project Summary:
The Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center (VICC) is an NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center with over
270 members focused on cancer-related research. The Vanderbilt Institute of Chemical Biology (VICB) High-
Throughput Screening (HTS) core facility was established to provide screening-based services for investigators
for molecular probe and pharmacological discovery. Dr. Joshua Bauer plays an integral role in the interface
between the cancer research and chemical biology programs at Vanderbilt. He has a strong background in
cancer biology, pharmacology, and biochemistry. His main goal is to use chemical genomic approaches,
including functional genomics screening and high-content imaging, to identify novel drug targets and to better
understand the molecular and genetic mechanisms that underlie how cancer cells respond to therapeutics. To
achieve this goal his cancer-related projects within the HTS facility are focused on three areas: 1) compound/drug
library screening (i.e., HTS), 2) functional genomics (siRNA/CRISPR) library screening, and 3) high-content
screening (HCS) and analysis. To date, Dr. Bauer has provided support and intellectual contributions to over 80
HTS projects, including collaborations with at least 41 Cancer Center members, including 31 that are NCI funded.
These continued collaborations have allowed him to develop innovative assays and novel screening projects
that contribute to the success of the Vanderbilt HTS core and cancer research program. His vital role and
success stems from his ability to conceive, collaborate, design and perform screens, and intellectually contribute
to projects, grant proposals, and manuscripts. In addition, through participation in conferences, meetings and
workshops Dr. Bauer strives to bring state-of-the-art technologies and ideas to the Vanderbilt HTS facility. The
blend of his skills, expertise, and knowledge provide a unique role within Vanderbilt to mend cancer research,
chemical biology, genomics, drug discovery, and translational drug investigation. Through his previously funded
R50 award, Dr. Bauer has already further advanced his areas of focus in HTS and his career development. So
far on the award (2016-20), he has been co-authored on 11 papers, has supported 38 cancer-related grant
proposals, supported and trained over 50 graduate students and postdocs on HTS instrumentation or software,
has developed several novel functional genomics screens (CRISPR and ORFeome), and has pioneered several
high-throughput 3D organoid models for high-content drug screening. Dr. Bauer has become a member of the
NCI- Chemical Biology Consortium where he has been exposed to world-class drug discovery experts. Finally,
the results of Dr. Bauer's work and collaborations have influenced the design of clinical trials, initiated sponsored
research, and has led to lead molecules for further development. Therefore, Dr. Bauer's continued role as a
Cancer Pharmacologist & HTS Scientist is completely indispensable to the cancer research program at
Vanderbilt."
10913980,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) stands out as notable in not having a cure among many diseases that affect
elderly men and women––in essence, creating an urgent need for a new therapy. It is also unclear why
menopausal women have a preponderance of AD, and, while declining estrogen bas been implicated, there is
clear clinical correlation with rising levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). We have identified FSH as a
target for several aging disorders––osteoporosis, obesity, hypercholesteremia––and now, AD. Inhibiting the
action of FSH using blocking antibodies reduces body fat, increases bone mass, lowers serum cholesterol, and
from our newest and most exciting results, prevents AD in two mouse models. We have designed a novel
humanized monoclonal antibody, Hu6, that binds to a small epitope within the receptor–binding domain of FSHβ,
thus blocking its action on the FSH receptor (FSHR). Our aspirational goal is to use this lead therapeutic for
the therapy and prevention of all four disorders––or, at the very least, AD. Selected from a pool of 30 newly
synthesized humanized antibodies, Hu6 displays high–affinity binding to FSH (KD ~7 nM) and thus prevents its
action on hippocampal FSHRs to improve cognition in AD mice. These observations, together with its optimal
pharmacokinetic profile, lay the groundwork for Hu6 to enter early stage development. In Specific Aim 1, we
propose to scale up production of research–grade Hu6; create an optimal formulation; test its physicochemical
properties; study the structure of the FSH:Hu6 complex; and manufacture a master cell bank for cGMP–grade
Hu6. In Specific Aim 2, we will perform pharmacokinetic studies in Tg32 mice ‘humanized’ for antibody
clearance, and in African green vervet monkeys; determine minimum effective dose(s) in preventing and/or
treating AD in 3xTg mice; examine efficacy and safety in young and aged 3xTg mice; and document safety in
vervet monkeys. The work will be conducted using Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) standards established at
Mount Sinai, Emory, Wake Forest and San Antonio. We have also created cross–functional research teams that
will be supported by a distinguished panel of advisors, comprising science and medicine experts, business
leaders, and entrepreneurs in biotechnology. Definitive information on dosage, route and frequency, together
with early proof of safety should propel us into late stage development and first–in–human studies."
10919206,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Administrative Core
This Duke/UT Southwestern Glioblastoma Therapeutics Network (GTN) team will complete pre-clinical
development of a novel treatment for patients with glioblastoma (GBM) and investigate the biologic activity of
this agent in an early-phase clinical trial. In support of this goal, this Administrative Core is responsible for
overseeing, integrating, coordinating, and supporting Projects 1 and 2 and the shared Biomarker, Bioinformatics
and Biorepository Core. The Administrative Core will oversee the organizational infrastructure, integration of all
components, and carry out day-to-day administrative activities; serve as the liaison with all internal and external
constituencies; provide support for preparation of reports, manuscripts, and regulatory documents; and foster
team science by facilitating collaboration and smooth communication through regular meetings, seminars, and

communication with Network Coordination Center, and the use of yearly trans-U19 Pilot Project Funds. This
Core is structured to reduce administrative burden, allowing investigators to focus on developing a novel
approach for treating adult GBM using an innovative telomerase-mediated telomere-targeting drug, 6-thio-2′-
deoxyguanosine (6-thio-dG), through high-quality, rigorous, and efficient research."
10919209,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Biomarker, Bioinformatics and Biorepository Core
The Duke/UT Southwestern Glioblastoma Therapeutics Network (GTN) team will complete pre-clinical
development of a novel treatment (6-thio-dG) for patients with glioblastoma (GBM) and investigate its biologic
activity in an early-phase clinical trial. This Biomarker, Bioinformatics and Biorepository Core (Bio-MIR Core) will
support this mission by 1) providing logistical, biomarker, biostatistical, bioinformatic and biorepository support
that enables this GTN team’s investigators to optimize 6-thio-dG treatment for patients with GBM, and 2) serving
as a resource to other GTN sites by enabling the broader network to access the same expertise and tissues.
The Bio-MIR Core will be indispensable for the successful conduct of the studies proposed in this application,
including the early-phase clinical trial of 6-thio-dG, by standardizing protocols for the collection of tissues and
centralizing analyses of key biomarkers of patient eligibility and tumor response to 6-thio-dG treatment (Aim 1).
We will provide expert neuropathologic consultation through central review of previously resected tumors and
ascertain IDH1/2 and TERT-promoter mutation status using CLIA-approved assays to determine eligibility to
receive 6-thio-dG. Following 6-thio-dG treatment and tumor resection, the Bio-MIR Core will again oversee
central neuropathologic review and measure pharmacodynamic endpoints, including γH2AX measures of DNA
damage (primary trial endpoint). The Bio-MIR Core will provide biobanking services for the collection, processing
and storage of all GBM patient tissues in a CAP-certified setting, and distribute these tissues both within the
Duke/UTSW GTN and across all GTN sites (Aim 2). The Bio-MIR Core will also provide biostatistics and
bioinformatics expertise for the conduct, analysis, and reporting of correlative studies, and ensure data integrity
through centralized integration of clinical data, including multi-platform data integration and coordination (Aim 3).
Further, the Bio-MIR Core will promote an exemplary research culture wherein best data management practices
are used throughout to ensure data integrity, provenance, security, and reproducibility of study findings. The Bio-
MIR Core will benefit from institutional and NIH investments made in key shared resources, including clinical
data warehousing and multi-institutional biobanking and specimen sharing, and utilize the expertise of
investigators that have conducted multi-center GBM research for more than three decades. The Bio-MIR Core
will facilitate collaboration between GTN investigators and will also work with the designated Network
Coordination Center for trans-GTN sharing of resources and participation in clinical trials of therapies advanced
by the GTN Steering Committee to multi-center evaluations. In this manner, the Bio-MIR Core will serve as an
indispensable resource helping to achieve the GTN’s overall goal of developing novel, effective agents that can
cross the blood-brain-barrier and testing them in the clinic to improve treatment for adults with GBM."
10919212,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Project 1
Gliomas are the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults and account for over 14,000 deaths
annually in the United States. The most common type of glioma, glioblastoma (GBM) has a median overall
survival of less than 21 months in spite of aggressive therapy. GBMs, like other human cancers, have activated
an enzyme called telomerase that rebuilds the ends of the chromosomes – regions known as telomeres – to
enable the cell’s replicative immortality. Indeed, roughly 90% of GBM cases harbor genetic alterations in the
TERT gene that activate telomerase. Unfortunately, efforts to directly target telomerase activity to date have
been hindered by lack of effective small molecules that cross the blood-brain-barrier, demonstrate on-target
effects, and show efficacy and specificity in GBMs. Therefore, there is a critical need to develop safe and
efficacious telomerase-targeted therapies for patients with GBM whose tumors harbor telomerase activating
genetic alterations.
 We previously used the purine analog pro-drug 6-thio-2’-deoxyguanosine (6-thio-dG), which was used in
human clinical trials in the 1970s, to develop a strategy for rapidly inducing telomerase-mediated cytotoxic DNA
damage at telomeres. Rather than inhibiting telomerase and allowing telomeres to get progressively shorter, 6-
thio-dG is taken up by cancer cells and converted into 6-thio-dGTP, which is then incorporated into newly
synthesized telomeric repeats. Once these modified segments accumulate in the telomeres, telomeric DNA
damage rapidly results, ultimately leading to cell death. In pre-clinical models of lung, colon, and melanoma,
treatment with 6-thio-dG led to rapid killing of the cancer cells with little toxicity to normal cells and tissues.
Importantly, telomeric DNA damage induced by 6-thio-dG also enhanced anti-tumor innate immunity. Building
on these data, we have extended our pre-clinical analysis to GBMs and obtained evidence that 6-thio-dG crosses
the blood-brain-barrier. The overall objective for Project 1 is to advance 6-thio-dG toward a clinical trial to be
conducted by Project 2. We propose the following Specific Aims: 1) Characterize the pre-clinical efficacy and
pharmacodynamic biomarkers of 6-thio-dG treatment alone or in combination with Temozolomide (TMZ) in an
extended panel of patient-derived cell lines, PDX and organoid models; 2) Test the anti-tumor efficacy and
inflammatory potential of 6-thio-dG alone and in combination with TMZ or immune checkpoint blockade (ICB)
therapies in immune competent murine models of GBM; and 3) Define cell toxicity and innate inflammatory
potential of 6-thio-dG in an ex vivo glioma tissue framework and patient-derived organoids. These studies will
determine the pre-clinical efficacy of 6-thio-dG in GBM and confirm biomarkers of efficacy that will guide the
design of clinical trials including enrollment criteria. This Project will work closely with the proposed Administrative
Core, Molecular Biomarker Core Resource, and Project 2 to achieve our shared goal of advancing 6-thio-dG
toward clinical application in GBM."
10919214,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Project 2
Glioblastoma (GBM) remains uniformly lethal, with an overall survival of <21 months despite standard of care
therapies. Immunotherapy has remarkable efficacy in many cancers, but has been less successful in GBM due
in part to the tumor’s immunosuppressive effects and high levels of intratumoral heterogeneity. The Duke/UT
Southwestern Glioblastoma Therapeutics Network (GTN) team will complete pre-clinical development of a novel
treatment for patients with glioblastoma (GBM) and investigate the biologic activity of this agent in an early-phase
clinical trial. Project 2 will contribute to this goal by investigating biomarkers of response to the telomerase-
targeted agent 6-thio-dG in pre-clinical models and by conducting a Phase 0 clinical trial to examine these
biomarkers in humans. 6-thio-dG is a blood brain barrier (BBB)-penetrant purine analog pro-drug that is
preferentially incorporated into newly synthesized telomeres under the control of telomerase. Incorporation of 6-
thio-dG into telomeres induces DNA damage and activates innate immune signaling, resulting in cell death.
Because roughly 90% of GBM express telomerase resulting from early and highly clonal TERT-promoter
mutations, 6-thio-dG represents an exciting mechanism to overcome tumor heterogeneity and activate anti-tumor
immune responses. Although we have shown that treatment with 6-thio-dG induces telomeric DNA damage and
elicits immune-mediated cytotoxicity in telomerase-positive cells, the optimal time-point for measuring 6-thio-dG-
induced DNA damage and innate immune activation as pharmacodynamic (PD) endpoints is unknown and will
be rigorously determined using patient-derived xenograft models (Aim 1). Additionally, most GBM patients
receive first-line treatment with temozolomide (TMZ), which can induce hypermutation and loss of telomerase
activity at recurrence. We will therefore evaluate the efficacy of 6-thio-dG following prior TMZ treatment and
identify mechanisms of therapy resistance in vivo (Aim 1). Based on experiments conducted in Aim 1 and in
Project 1, we will establish preliminary biomarkers of sensitivity and response to 6-thio-dG treatment in a Phase
0 window-of-opportunity trial in adults with newly diagnosed, telomerase-positive GBM (Aim 2). Following a 2-
day pre-surgical course of 6-thio-dG, we will examine GBM tissues for detectable increases in DNA damage
(primary endpoint) and activation of immune responses. These studies will enable the design and conduct of a
Phase 0 trial of 6-thio-dG, identify patient populations likeliest to benefit from therapy, and assess biomarkers of
sensitivity and response to 6-thio-dG among newly diagnosed patients with telomerase-positive GBM. The GBM
clinical trials infrastructures of Duke and UTSW, which treat a diverse patient population representing ~10% of
all U.S. patients with GBM, is an excellent setting for this trial. Project 2 thus contributes to this GTN U19’s overall
goal and to the NCI’s goal to develop novel therapies to improve treatment for adults with GBM."

10927326,"PROJECT SUMMARY: CANCER RESEARCH TRAINING & EDUCATION COORDINATION
 The Buffett Cancer Center (BCC) has a firm and lasting commitment to cancer research training at all
levels. Therefore, the Cancer Research Training and Education Core (CRTEC) acts as a crucial component of
the BCC, ensuring the continuity and advancement of cancer research education in its basic, translational, and
clinical forms. The BCC CRTEC is responsive to the unique needs of our catchment area and its medically
underserved and underrepresented populations, as well as mindful of the importance of international
collaborations and outreach. The Specific Aims of the CRTEC are as follows:
 Aim 1: To provide cancer-related education and training to middle, high school, and undergraduate
students in programs which emphasize the inclusion of students who are disadvantaged.
 Aim 2: To educate students who are in graduate and professional programs in cancer research to
prepare them for academic, industry, and clinical leadership positions.
 Aim 3: To offer training to enable fellows, junior faculty, and senior faculty members to reach high
educational and research goals focused on cancer.
 The CRTEC Executive Committee (led by the BCC Associate Director for Training and Education) is
advised by an Internal Advisory Board that has members from each University of Nebraska Medical Center
(UNMC) college and from the Eppley Institute. This Executive Committee coordinates BCC cancer research
education so that from middle school trainees through faculty there is a mentoring continuum of cancer-relevant
and level-appropriate programs, courses, workshops, seminars, evaluations, and pilot grant funding, along with
specialized educational initiatives funded by the NCI and other agencies, thereby establishing cancer research
training of the highest quality. These cancer research education initiatives take advantage of the top-notch
research resources of the BCC, and they are necessary for all of the activities and accomplishments of the BCC
Programs: the Cancer Biology Program (CBP), Targets, Modulators, and Delivery Program (TMDP), and
Gastrointestinal Cancer Program (GICP). Thus, the efforts of the BCC in cancer research education and training
are fully integral to the mission and the values of the BCC, and are key to its ability to improve the health of
Nebraskans both now and in the future."
10927332,"Project Summary/Abstract: Cancer Biology Program (CBP)
 The overall goal of research in the Cancer Biology Program (CBP), previously the Molecular and Biochemical
Etiology Program, is to understand mechanisms that underlie cancer initiation and progression that could lead
to new biomarkers and interventional strategies to positively impact cancer diagnosis, prevention, and
therapeutic strategies across cancers prevalent in the BCC catchment area. To clearly delineate our mission
and themes, we strategically reorganized the program to focus on basic cancer mechanisms, with translational
efforts pursued in collaboration with the Targets, Modulators, and Delivery (TMDP) and GI Cancer (GICP)
programs. To this end, we retained 14 prior members and added 24 new investigators with a basic cancer biology
focus. The major goals of the CBP are to define the molecular mechanisms that maintain genome stability and
their alterations in cancer, dissect intracellular signaling mechanisms and tumor cell-microenvironment
interactions, and elucidate and harness metabolic and other mechanisms that lead to host systemic organ
dysfunction and contribute to cancer patient morbidity and mortality. The 38 CBP members come from eight
departments across the University with multidisciplinary interests in DNA damage/repair processes, signaling
mechanisms, metabolomics, redox biology, and cell- and animal-based cancer models. The research interests
of program members are organized around three Themes. Theme 1. Genome Instability and Cancer. Members
focus on studies of genome replication, DNA damage responses and repair, and identification of new genomic
alterations that drive hereditary or sporadic cancer. Theme 2. Signaling Mechanisms in Cancer. Members focus
on elucidating intra- and inter-cellular signaling mechanisms that drive tumorigenesis and metastasis. Theme 3.
Metabolic Alterations and Systemic Dysfunction in Cancer. Members focus on cancer cell metabolism and redox
biology, and the impact of tumor burden on organ systems, with a particular focus on cancer cachexia and
fatigue. There is extensive cross-talk between Themes, and basic mechanisms and pathways elucidated under
CBP provide a rich basis for inter-programmatic collaborations with TMDP and GICP towards further translation
into potential target validation and inhibitor design and translational studies. The Co-Leaders leverage their
complementary expertise to enhance inter- and intra-programmatic collaborations through the development and
employment of new and existing shared resources, evaluation and funding of pilot projects supporting the CBP
mission, involvement in faculty recruitment, and organization of regular programmatic meetings. These activities
have led to a strong collaborative group as demonstrated by impactful inter- and intra-programmatic, cancer-
focused publications and grants, and an increased focus on basic biology with the potential for clinical translation.
Cancer-relevant peer-reviewed CBP funding is $6.87M (direct), of which $1.9M is from the NCI. During the
previous funding period, CBP members reported 304 cancer-relevant publications, with 43% intra-programmatic,
45% inter-programmatic, 28% both intra- and inter-programmatic, and 38% inter-institutional publications."
10927339,"Project Summary/Abstract: Targets, Modulators, and Delivery Program (TMDP)
The mission of the Targets, Modulators, and Delivery Program (TMDP; formerly known as the Cancer Genes
and Molecular Regulation Program) is to validate targets, develop small molecules that modulate cancer targets,
and develop methods for efficient delivery of modulators to tumor cells. The TMDP is organized to promote
collaboration and catalyze the translation of scientific discoveries from Fred & Pamela Buffett Cancer Center
(BCC) basic research program members while providing BCC translational research programs access to
validated targets, small molecule modulators, and delivery methods for clinical translation. The TMDP integrates
the efforts of 18 physician-scientists (including adult and pediatric hematologist/oncologists, radiation oncologists
and surgical oncologists) with expertise in clinical trial development and 23 investigators with expertise in cancer
target development, medicinal chemistry, pharmacology, and nanodelivery. Together, the program members
develop tools and technology to facilitate translation of basic science discoveries by the bench-to-bedside
continuum within BCC research programs. Resources developed by the TMDP to support novel chemical entity
(NCE) discovery/development within the TMDP and the BCC include the Synthetic and Medicinal Chemistry
Resource, PROteolysis Targeting Chimera (PROTAC) synthesis and Computational Chemistry Resource. The
translational research efforts of the TMDP faculty extend across the full range of malignancies that are of critical
importance to the population of Nebraska, including lung cancer, ovarian cancer, multiple myeloma, lymphoma,
acute leukemia, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer and medulloblastoma. The research interests of TMDP faculty
are organized around three interactive themes – Target Validation, Small Molecule Modulators, Delivery Methods
– that contribute to the overarching goal of bench-to-bedside research translation through intra- and inter-
programmatic collaboration. These themes exemplify the specific aims of the TMDP to 1) develop conceptual
and technical approaches to validate cancer targets; 2) identify and characterize target- and mechanism-specific
small molecules directed at validated cancer targets; and 3) explore novel technologies for efficient delivery of
small molecules or RNAi against validated cancer targets. Physician scientists within the TMDP with clinical
trials expertise facilitate the translation of putative targets, chemical modulators, and delivery methods with
therapeutic potential. The interactions between TMDP members, their interactions with other BCC Programs,
and their inter-institutional collaborations promote impactful and translational studies. These interactions have
resulted in $4.25M (direct) of cancer-relevant peer-reviewed funding to TMDP investigators, with 3.17M from the
NCI. During the funding period, the TMDP investigators reported 647 cancer-relevant publications (average
journal impact factor = 7), with 37% intra-programmatic, 28% inter-programmatic, 18% both intra- and inter-
programmatic and 41% inter-institutional publications."
10927347,"Project Summary/Abstract: Gastrointestinal Cancer Program (GICP)
Established in 2013, the Gastrointestinal Cancer Program (GICP) is the newest Program in the Fred & Pamela
Buffet Cancer Center (BCC). The research and clinical efforts of the GICP focus on pancreatic and colorectal
cancer, two cancers that are highly relevant to our state of Nebraska catchment area. The mission of the GICP
is to better understand the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of pancreatic and colorectal cancers, identify and
validate new diagnostic and prognostic tools for these diseases, and develop new therapeutic options for patients
with these malignancies. To address these goals, the GICP has been organized into three interacting themes,
each of which integrates basic and translational science: 1) Mechanisms of GI Tumorigenesis, 2) Biomarkers,
and 3) Novel Treatment Approaches. The establishment of the GICP reflects the success of a longstanding
Working Group in Pancreatic Cancer, the foundation of which includes an internationally recognized Rapid
Autopsy Program for comprehensive collection of tissues from pancreatic cancer patients. Additional support for
research initiatives in pancreatic cancer comes from several multi-investigator grants focusing on target
identification, biomarker discovery and validation, and novel treatment approaches, which highlight the
interactive nature of the GICP membership. Accomplishments in pancreatic cancer have recently been extended
to colorectal cancer, with the recruitment of several investigators with expertise in colorectal cancer research
serving to enhance this focus area since the last review. The Program is co-led by a clinician scientist, Chi Lin,
MD, PhD and a basic scientist, Jennifer Black, PhD, with complementary expertise in radiation oncology and
clinical trials and signal transduction mechanisms in colorectal and pancreatic cancer, respectively. The Program
has 27 members, 14 basic scientists and 13 clinician scientists. The Co-Directors leverage their expertise to
enhance intra- and inter-programmatic collaboration through the development of new shared resources, the
evaluation and funding of pilot projects supporting the GICP mission, the attraction of high profile speakers for
Grand Rounds and regular seminar series, the organization of regular programmatic meetings, and the
identification of opportunities for clinical advancement of research findings. These activities have promoted a
strongly collaborative group as demonstrated by inter- and intra-programmatic publications and grants. Clinical
investigators have facilitated the translation of recent preclinical findings into new investigator-initiated
therapeutic trials. Cancer relevant peer-reviewed funding (annual direct costs) for the program is currently
$5.59M; of which ~82% is from the NCI. 406 manuscripts were published by GICP investigators during the
current funding period, of which 50% are intra-programmatic, 48% are inter-programmatic, and 34% are inter-
institutional. Future plans include development of novel models for pancreatic and colorectal cancer research,
expansion of biomarker validation and development efforts, growth of the colorectal cancer research focus,
recruitment of additional clinical faculty, and continued strengthening of the GICP clinical trial portfolio."
10927354,"PROJECT SUMMARY: COMMNUNITY OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT
Cancer is the second leading cause of death in Nebraska.1 The Buffett Cancer Center (BCC) at the University
of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) strives to ease the cancer burden and address cancer disparities through
bidirectional academic and community partnerships. UNMC's statewide educational and clinical presence has
served all Nebraskans across its spectrum of rural, urban, and racial/ethnic demographics. Capitalizing on
UNMC's momentum and building on long-term partnerships across the state, the BCC established a Community
Outreach and Engagement Office (COEO). The COEO provides infrastructure to stoke existing relationships
and forge new activities with stakeholders across the catchment area, which is defined as the state of
Nebraska. The state's population of 1.9 million people live in 93 counties that span 77,000 square miles.2 Of
these, 7 are urban, 52 are rural, and 34 are frontier (having fewer than 7 residents per square mile) counties.3
The diverse racial, ethnic, and rural vs. urban populations in Nebraska have distinct needs related to cancer
incidence and mortality, and each community faces different barriers to cancer screening, prevention, and
treatment. The COEO helps integrate BCC's research and healthcare enterprise with catchment area
stakeholders through bidirectional community engagement activities, encompassing needs assessment,
ongoing measurement, and creation of avenues for mutual access. The COEO works with external groups,
including the CDC-funded Nebraska Comprehensive Cancer Control Program and the statewide Nebraska
Cancer Coalition, to align and prioritize strategies and approaches to address state-level needs. External (21
members) and Internal (9 members) Advisory Boards provide ongoing input and support to engagement efforts,
educational activities, government relations, and policy recommendations. The COEO's internal partners include
UNMC's Rural Health Initiative, Office of Community Engagement, Center for Reducing Health Disparities, Office
of Public Health Practice, and UNMC patient navigators who play key roles in community outreach,
engagement, and recruitment for cancer trials among underserved communities. Future plans will expand
efforts through these aims: (1) understand, measure, and monitor the cancer incidence, mortality, determinants,
community needs, and disparities in Nebraska over time; (2) facilitate and enable the conduct of research directly
relevant to the needs in Nebraska and improve access to clinical trials across the state; (3) engage Nebraskans
and implement evidence-based actions that can reduce the burden of risk factors and cancers at a population
level; and (4) promote translation of BCC research with support from strong community partnerships to inform
state cancer policies. The COEO facilitates the integrated and ongoing bidirectional community input to
develop and implement cancer research and healthcare of particular relevance to the state and works
with community partners to engage diverse populations across Nebraska in the research and clinical trials
conducted by the BCC to ensure that the people of its catchment area are served."
10927362,"PROJECT SUMMARY: LEADERSHIP PLANNING AND EVALUATION
The Fred & Pamela Buffett Cancer Center (BCC) will continue to leverage strong leadership and effective
planning processes, internal and external advisors, university and hospital leaders, and community partners,
to strengthen and advance innovative scientific and clinical research, promote transdisciplinary collaborations
integrated with cancer care, strengthen and expand cancer training and educational programs for trainees and
faculty, and expand community outreach and engagement with diverse community partners across the state.
Important accomplishments since the last review include the opening of the new BCC ($350 M 615,000 sq ft)
Integrated Cancer Research and Cancer Care Facility, which resulted in expansion and consolidation of
research space. The BCC Director now has authority over 400,000 sq ft space for research, which represents
a 67% increase since the last review and 3.3-fold increase since 1999. During this funding period, the BCC
organization was strengthened with the Director now reporting directly to both the UNMC Chancellor and the
Nebraska Medicine CEO, and serving as the BCC Physician-in-Chief, ensuring oversight over cancer research
and clinical programs across the university and the healthcare network. Since the last review, the BCC has
recruited Ray Bergan as BCC Deputy Director and added a new position as Associate Director for Community
Outreach and Engagement. In addition, three new leaders were appointed since 2015 including the Associate
Director Basic Research, Associate Director Translational Research, and Associate Director Training and
Education. To continue to achieve advances envisioned by the leadership, the BCC will: 1) expand support for
recruitment and development of key priority areas of scientific focus; 2) increase research that addresses the
cancer burden and disparities in our catchment area (Nebraska); 3) develop an organization committed to
interdisciplinary, collaborative translational research; and 4) expand training and education and externally
funded programs with an emphasis on diversity. Evaluation is a priority and is used to ensure that resources
are aligned with priorities. Progress is reviewed throughout the year, with a comprehensive review annually, the
latter in particular serving as a foundation to assess progress and revise strategies. This includes evaluations
by Members of all Shared Resources, and key activities, such as those managed through the Clinical Trial
Office. Progress in Community Outreach and Engagement is reviewed with the COE Community Advisory
Board and Internal Advisory Board quarterly. The BCC will continue to receive input from its External Advisory
Board annually and throughout the year as needed. The BCC will leverage institutional leadership and
resources, and will engage key stakeholders in support of its aims to: 1) develop a strong senior leadership for
establishing the BCC vision and goals; 2) advance effective strategies to achieve BCC objectives; and 3)
implement processes to evaluate progress and refine strategies to achieve BCC objectives."

11124973,"eDyNAmiC (extrachromosomal DNA in Cancer)
Human genes are arranged on 23 pairs of chromosomes, but in cancer, tumour-promoting genes can free themselves from chromosomes and relocate to circular, extrachromosomal pieces of DNA (ecDNA). These ecDNA do not follow the normal “rules” of chromosomal inheritance, enabling tumours to achieve far higher levels of cancer-causing oncogenes than would otherwise be possible, and licensing cancers with a way to evolve and change their genomes to evade treatments at rates that would be unthinkable for human cells. The altered circular architecture of ecDNAs also changes the way that the cancer-causing genes are regulated and expressed, further contributing to aggressive tumour growth. These unique features make ecDNA-containing cancers especially aggressive and difficult to treat. Cancer patients whose tumours harbour ecDNA have markedly shorter survival. Despite being first seen over fifty years ago, the critical importance of ecDNA has only recently come to light, and the scale of the problem is substantial. ecDNAs are present in nearly half of all human cancer types and potentially up-to a third of all cancer patients. The collective current understanding of how ecDNA form, how they function, how they move around the cell, how they evolve to resist treatment, how they impact the immune system, and how they can be effectively targeted are lacking. We bring together an internationally recognized, pioneering interdisciplinary team of cancer biologists, geneticists, computer scientists, evolutionary biologists, mathematicians, clinicians, and patient advocates to boldly create novel insights and resources and to provide transformative solutions to one of Cancer’s Grand Challenges. A core team of experienced and productive ecDNA investigators will work with new investigators in the ecDNA and cancer fields to bring completely new perspectives and approaches to this daunting challenge. By bridging cutting-edge and diverse approaches and insights from cancer genomics, yeast genetics, epigenomics, artificial genome synthesis, longitudinal patient tracking, combinatorial and machine learning algorithms, mathematical modelling, immunobiology, and innovative chemistry we will develop a new understanding of the role of ecDNA in cancer, and we will find new ways to drug the undruggable. This bold programme, which consists of 7 work packages and a committed international infrastructure, generates new and unusual collaborations that would simply be impossible under any other type of funding mechanism. Our programme endeavours to foster bold innovative solutions to one of the hardest problems in cancer and to one of the greatest challenges facing cancer patients."
11175735,"The cancer research community is on the verge of a major leap in our understanding of the factors that contribute to human cancer risk. While it is clear that mutations in DNA, either spontaneous or environmentally induced, are essential for cancer development, recent advances have highlighted the importance of non-mutagenic factors as rate-limiting determinants of cancer risk in human populations and in mouse cancer models. 
The root causes of human cancer have been widely debated, but most of the emphasis has been on the origins of the “driver” mutations that are ubiquitous in human tumours. Although epidemiology studies have highlighted the possible roles of lifestyle factors such as obesity, alcohol consumption, inflammation and poor diet in cancer risk, it has generally been assumed that these factors act directly or indirectly to cause mutations in DNA, thus contributing to tumour mutational burden and resulting in increased cancer risk. In contrast, recent sequencing studies have uncovered abundant mutations in normal human tissues, suggesting that even strong cancer driver mutations are not sufficient for cancer formation. These results were presaged by studies of mouse tumour models, some carried out more than 50 years ago, showing that promotion is the rate-limiting step in tumour development.
To identify the mechanisms that control mutated normal cells, and to elucidate the precise mechanisms by which promoting factors stimulate the conversion of these cells to neoplastic growth, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team of investigators with wide-ranging experience in epidemiology, genetics, computational network analysis and machine learning, tissue imaging of gene expression, single cell transcriptomics, and genome-wide CRISPR functional screens. We will focus human analysis on a unique collection of several thousand human normal and matched tumour samples from >20 countries, including regions of both high and low cancer risk. Detailed risk factor information and whole genome sequence data is available from all these samples as part of the Grand Challenge Mutographs study. Analysis of these samples, together with detailed intervention studies in human populations, mouse models and human organoids, will allow us to develop a roadmap of tumour promotion from single normal cells carrying driver mutations, through to malignant progression. Our findings will facilitate identification of the causative environmental factors that promote cancer and provide routes to new methods and approaches to cancer prevention based on a deeper understanding of the process of initiated cell selection by tumour promoting agents."
11124974,"Background
Cancer cachexia (CC) is a systemic, metabolic wasting syndrome featuring body weight loss due to skeletal muscle and adipose tissue wasting. CC is suffered by ~80% of cancer patients that causes reduced performance status, intolerance to chemotherapy, and increased mortality. This debilitating condition is poorly understood and has no effective treatment. If CC therapy existed, it would improve treatment responses, increase quality of life, and prolong survival. With 50 years of study, the field has focused on defining pathways that promote atrophy in the end-organs most affected by cachexia. While this work has been fruitful, it has not led to identification of the upstream mediators of CC, nor has it generated effective therapies. There is an urgent need for high-quality discovery science and more detailed clinical phenotyping. We have created a virtual institute comprised of diverse, international, multidisciplinary scientists and clinicians with expertise in cancer, metabolism, neuroendocrine function, immunology, human metabolic diseases, preclinical models, and clinical phenotyping. We hypothesize that CC is driven by tumor-intrinsic factors that activate neurohormonal sickness pathways, which then induce anorexia, metabolic dysfunction, and tissue atrophy.
Methods
Our approach involves sophisticated measures of host-tumor interactions including innovative investigation of (1) systemic metabolic flux in mice using isotope tracing, imaging mass spectroscopy, dynamic nuclear imaging, and dietary and pharmacologic interventions; (2) cellular components and secreted factors from the tumor microenvironment using imaging mass cytometry, patient-derived organoid xenografts, microbial toxins, and CRISPR-based manipulations; (3) central pathways regulating appetite, behavior, and peripheral organ metabolism using human metabolic phenotyping, optogenetic, and pharmacological methods. We will perform the largest, most comprehensive observational study in CC subjects to thoroughly define CC subtypes and their clinical biomarkers using epidemiologic tools, novel image segmentation algorithms, and cluster analyses.
Project Goals
Our vision is to develop mechanistically informed treatments for cancer cachexia (CC) to improve quality of life and life expectancy for patients. Working as a multidisciplinary team with expertise in basic science, clinical research, and epidemiology, we will establish a therapeutically relevant classification of molecular and clinical subtypes of CC. We will build therapies to normalize metabolism and neuroendocrine dysregulation in CC to enable successful anti-cancer treatment and systemic recovery for patients. In 5 years, we will have laid the foundation for a new generation of CC treatment trials and strategies that will, for the first time, deliver practice-changing evidence for improved outcomes for patients with cancer who are at risk of or suffer from CC."

The collective current understanding of how ecDNA form, how they function, how they move around the cell, how they evolve to resist treatment, how they impact the immune system, and how they can be effectively targeted are lacking. We bring together an internationally recognized, pioneering interdisciplinary team of cancer biologists, geneticists, computer scientists, evolutionary biologists, mathematicians, clinicians, and patient advocates to boldly create novel insights and resources and to provide transformative solutions to one of Cancer’s Grand Challenges. A core team of experienced and productive ecDNA investigators will work with new investigators in the ecDNA and cancer fields to bring completely new perspectives and approaches to this daunting challenge. By bridging cutting-edge and diverse approaches and insights from cancer genomics, yeast genetics, epigenomics, artificial genome synthesis, longitudinal patient tracking, combinatorial and machine learning algorithms, mathematical modelling, immunobiology, and innovative chemistry we will develop a new understanding of the role of ecDNA in cancer, and we will find new ways to drug the undruggable. This bold programme, which consists of 7 work packages and a committed international infrastructure, generates new and unusual collaborations that would simply be impossible under any other type of funding mechanism. Our programme endeavours to foster bold innovative solutions to one of the hardest problems in cancer and to one of the greatest challenges facing cancer patients."

Cancer cachexia (CC) is a systemic, metabolic wasting syndrome featuring body weight loss due to skeletal muscle and adipose tissue wasting. CC is suffered by ~80% of cancer patients that causes reduced performance status, intolerance to chemotherapy, and increased mortality. This debilitating condition is poorly understood and has no effective treatment. If CC therapy existed, it would improve treatment responses, increase quality of life, and prolong survival. With 50 years of study, the field has focused on defining pathways that promote atrophy in the end-organs most affected by cachexia. While this work has been fruitful, it has not led to identification of the upstream mediators of CC, nor has it generated effective therapies. There is an urgent need for high-quality discovery science and more detailed clinical phenotyping. We have created a virtual institute comprised of diverse, international, multidisciplinary scientists and clinicians with expertise in cancer, metabolism, neuroendocrine function, immunology, human metabolic diseases, preclinical models, and clinical phenotyping. We hypothesize that CC is driven by tumor-intrinsic factors that activate neurohormonal sickness pathways, which then induce anorexia, metabolic dysfunction, and tissue atrophy.
Methods
Our approach involves sophisticated measures of host-tumor interactions including innovative investigation of (1) systemic metabolic flux in mice using isotope tracing, imaging mass spectroscopy, dynamic nuclear imaging, and dietary and pharmacologic interventions; (2) cellular components and secreted factors from the tumor microenvironment using imaging mass cytometry, patient-derived organoid xenografts, microbial toxins, and CRISPR-based manipulations; (3) central pathways regulating appetite, behavior, and peripheral organ metabolism using human metabolic phenotyping, optogenetic, and pharmacological methods. We will perform the largest, most comprehensive observational study in CC subjects to thoroughly define CC subtypes and their clinical biomarkers using epidemiologic tools, novel image segmentation algorithms, and cluster analyses.
Project Goals
Our vision is to develop mechanistically informed treatments for cancer cachexia (CC) to improve quality of life and life expectancy for patients. Working as a multidisciplinary team with expertise in basic science, clinical research, and epidemiology, we will establish a therapeutically relevant classification of molecular and clinical subtypes of CC. We will build therapies to normalize metabolism and neuroendocrine dysregulation in CC to enable successful anti-cancer treatment and systemic recovery for patients. In 5 years, we will have laid the foundation for a new generation of CC treatment trials and strategies that will, for the first time, deliver practice-changing evidence for improved outcomes for patients with cancer who are at risk of or suffer from CC."
10934547,"Project Summary/Abstract
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) affects more than six million Americans currently and is projected to affect 14 million
at a cost of $1.2 trillion in 2050. Despite its tremendous impacts and the limited influence of pharmacological
therapies, attention has been brought to non-pharmacological interventions as promising therapeutic strategies
for the prevention of cognitive decline. Aerobic exercise and cognitive training, particularly when in combination
represent important behavioral interventions for cognition in persons at risk for AD. Both preventative medicine
therapies are cost-effective strategies and aim to preserve the mental abilities, daily living performance, and
cognitive well-being of individuals in the early stages of the disease. The proposed project will build on findings
from the Phase II pilot where the feasibility and efficacy of Virtual Reality Cognitive Training (VRCT) combined
with concurrent aerobic cycling (Exergame) was demonstrated in a clinical trial. This clinical trial was
conducted utilizing a supervised intervention model, which is important for demonstrating preliminary feasibility
and efficacy, but has limitations for addressing real-world feasibility and sustainability. Currently, the top two
reported barriers for participation in community or facility-based, preventive medicine therapies such as
exercise and cognitive training include burdens of travel or time commitment. Recently, advancements in
technology have allowed for home-based (asynchronous) telerehabilitation interventions such as exercise
training to be utilized as a supplement or replacement to conventional, synchronous rehabilitation programs.
Although telerehabilitation is a growing form of therapy, it has yet to be studied in persons at risk for AD or with
Exergame therapy. In order for Exergames to be a sustainable preventive medicine approach to AD, its
feasibility and efficacy in a home-based (asynchronous) setting is needed. In order to expand our reach and
marketability of the Exergame and combat these participation barriers, the sustainability and efficacy of
Exergames in a home-based environment must be addressed. In support of expanding the reach and
marketability of the Exergame, the purpose of this project is to: 1) develop a fully-featured version of the VRCT
aspect of the Exergame that can be installed and updated remotely in order to support home-based use and,
2) assess the feasibility, efficacy, and sustainability of the Exergame in a home-based, asynchronous
telerehabilitation setting via a clinical trial. Once the fully-featured Exergame with remote installation and
updating capacity has been completed, the clinical trial, using a 2:2 factorial design will randomize 104
community-dwelling older adults at risk of AD to one of four arms for 3 months: home-based (asynchronous)
Exergames, supervised Exergame, home-based asynchronous aerobic exercise, or supervised aerobic
exercise. This project is innovative as 1) it addresses barriers for the real world use of the Exergame, which will
increase the reach and marketability of the product, and 2) the clinical trial uses gold standard laboratory, real
world (“field”), and novel blood biomarker efficacy and sustainability assessments of the Exergames."

 Jie Fan, M.D., M.Sc. has been working in the VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System (VAPHS) since
2003 and is a VA Research Career Scientist, a Director of the Surgical Research Program, a Vice-
Chair of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, a Mentor of VA Career Development
Awardees at VAPHS, and a tenured Full Professor of Surgery and Immunology in the Departments of
Surgery and Immunology at the University of Pittsburgh. He is a Principal Investigator working on the
cellular and molecular mechanisms of post-trauma and post-sepsis systemic inflammatory response
syndrome (SIRS) and acute lung injury (ALI), an important but exceptionally difficult area. His
laboratory has been continuously funded by VA merit review grants since 2007 and NIH research
grants (R01, P50, and R56) since 2005.
 The burden of trauma- and sepsis-related diseases is considerable in veterans. Following
exsanguination and/or brain injury that commonly result in early phase death, more than 60% of
surviving patients later die of causes related to the development of SIRS, sepsis, and ALI. This patient
population is well suited for prophylactic interventions aimed at preventing these occurrences because
of the time lag before the onset of organ inflammation and failure. Nonetheless, few specific targets
have been identified that predispose to SIRS and ALI. The long-term goal of Dr. Fan's studies is to
provide a new understanding of the mechanisms of post-trauma/post-infection inflammation and organ
dysfunction and to develop novel preventive and therapeutic interventions in SIRS, sepsis, and ALI.
The studies by Dr. Fan's team will also provide a greater understanding of the pathogenesis of multiple
human diseases in which inflammation plays a central role.
 ALI is one of the common endpoints of SIRS and sepsis. SIRS and sepsis are common causes of
mortality following surgery, infection, spinal injury, stroke, hemorrhage, and trauma in the veteran
population. And thus, Dr. Fan's research is highly relevant to veterans' health.
 Dr. Fan is a highly productive Principal Investigator with a long track record of both VA and NIH
funding. He has also served in roles such as Co-Investigator, Consultant, and Collaborator on
numerous other's research grants. His research and collaborations have resulted in 136 peer-reviewed
publications, many of them in the first-line scientific journals, including Nature Medicine, Nature
Communications, Journal of Clinical Investigation, Hepatology, Journal of Hepatology, Cell Death &
Differentiation, and Journal of Immunology. Dr. Fan's work is renowned by his peers nationally and
internationally. He has been an invited speaker at numerous national and international conferences and
at many research and educational institutions. He serves as a regular or Ad Hoc member in a number
of national peer-review committees, including NIH, VA, DoD, American Institution of Biological Sciences
study sections, and European scientific institutions. He also serves as an editor-in-chief, member of
editorial board, and invited reviewer for over 50 scientific journals.
 He has mentored 33 VA and VA WOC trainees including VA Career Development Awardee,
surgery residents, Ph.D. candidates, postdoctoral fellows, and visiting scholars, many of whom have
now become independent scientists or physician-scientists."

 Socioeconomic and racial-ethnic inequalities in obesity are well documented in the literature. It is vital to
understand the determinants of these disparities in obesity, as obesity is linked to increased risk for many
other health outcomes including cancer, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, stroke, asthma, and early mortality. It is
suggested that these disparities are due, to some extent, to the built and natural environments as well as in
housing quality in the communities where low-income and minority populations live. However, it is unclear as
to the extent to which health disparities can be reduced by improving housing and neighborhood
environments, e.g., by improving walkability, green space, healthy food access, safety, and air quality, in low-
income minority communities. To address this research gap, we propose to study a time-sensitive natural
experiment that will ultimately significantly improve opportunities for health by altering the built-environment
and housing quality in a low-income urban community. The Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles is
planning to redevelop the Rancho San Pedro (hereafter, Rancho) community, an obsolete 478-unit public
housing project located next to the Port of Los Angeles. The redevelopment will build new housing for existing
residents, add additional units for affordable housing, mixed-income housing and homeownership units,
provide several opportunities for healthier lifestyles via parks, green spaces, jogging trails, community gardens,
street lighting, and retail space, and create housing and built environment enhancements that will reduce air
pollution exposure from the Port. Current Rancho residents will continue to live in existing housing during the
redevelopment, and as a result, residents will experience construction-related disruption (loss of greenspace
and walkability, noise and air pollution). Our goal is to study the effects of these short-term disruptions on
residents’ BMI and related health outcomes (e.g., cardiovascular, asthma exacerbation). We will do this by
following a cohort of residents of Rancho and a control public housing site. In Aim 1, we will examine the short-
term impact of the Rancho public housing redevelopment on residents’ BMI and related health outcomes. In
Aim 2, we will unpack the potential mechanisms for the observed change in health outcomes to investigate
both why and how observed changes occur. Finally, in Aim 3, we will explore moderating effects by time-
activity patterns, socio-demographics, and health status to understand for whom and under what
circumstances changes were observed."
10870216,"Project Summary/Abstract: Approximately 10% of adolescents are diagnosed with an alcohol or other drug (AOD) use
disorder each year in the U.S. Such disorders increase risk of premature mortality and morbidity and confer negative effects
on social and neurocognitive functioning, biobehavioral maturation, and the achievement of developmental milestones.
Despite advances in intervention research for adolescent AOD,1-4 the science base, in general, has lagged sorely behind that
of adults.5-7 Furthermore, few studies have tested effective treatment models that can sustain youth remission over time as
adolescents navigate the high-risk period of emerging adulthood. While many different interventions for youth AOD
disorders have been developed and tested producing similar results,1 absent is one that links youth to ubiquitous, freely
available, community recovery resources, such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) or Narcotics Anonymous (NA). Systematic
clinical linkages to these 12-step community resources have the potential to extend and enhance formal interventions’ effects
because they have been shown to mobilize the same kinds of therapeutic mechanisms mobilized by formal treatments (e.g.,
by enhancing motivation/self-efficacy, changing social networks),8, 9 but do so for free and over the long-term in the
community.10, 11 The evidence in support of adult participation in these organizations has grown substantially with findings
supporting clinic-based Twelve-Step Facilitation (TSF)12-17 interventions and community 12-step group participation12, 18, 19
in enhancing remission rates while reducing health costs.20-22 In more recent years, several naturalistic studies have examined
the clinical and public health utility of systematically linking young people with these prevalent resources 23-31 showing
long-term benefits from AA/NA8, 28, 30 and in reducing health care costs,31 similar to adults. While dozens of studies have
tested adult TSF efficacy,17, 32, 33 until recently, none had tested youth TSF efficacy, despite 80% of youth programs using
12-step practices and linkage.28, 34 In the first NIH-funded study to develop and test a replicable, manualized, adolescent
TSF, however, we found that youth randomly assigned to receive a novel combination treatment (Integrated Treatment for
Enhancing Growth in Recovery during Adolescence [InTEGRA]) that incorporated key elements of TSF in addition to
Motivational Enhancement Therapy/Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (MET/CBT), showed moderate-large clinically
meaningful advantages that grew across follow-ups when compared to youth receiving MET/CBT alone. They also attended
two to three times as many 12-step meetings during treatment, with 12-step attendees showing significantly greater
abstinence.35 Given initial efficacy and potential for widespread adoption and implementation,34, 36, 37 InTEGRA now needs
to be tested in a larger sample, with additional emphases on how (i.e., mechanisms) and for whom (i.e., moderators) it
works. Using a type I hybrid implementation-effectiveness design,38 this study proposes to: 1. Conduct an adequately
powered (N=294) Phase II RCT to test InTEGRA efficacy relative to MET/CBT alone across two clinical sites. 2.
Investigate mechanisms of behavior change (e.g., 12-step involvement; social networks, self-efficacy) through which
InTEGRA confers benefit. 3. Explore moderators (e.g., age, psychiatric/AOD severity) of InTEGRA’s effects across a one-
year follow-up. 4. Explore barriers and facilitators to the intervention’s widespread implementation."
10862666,"ABSTRACT
Endothelial cells (ECs) form an essential part of the vasculature and are strategically located between blood and
tissues, functioning as a fundamental barrier between the tissue and the immune system. As such, ECs can be
viewed as an essential and active component regulating immune responses. We propose that EC's angiogenic
vs. immune-modulatory function can be linked through the same genetic mechanism. We recently reported that
Myct1 (MYC target 1), encoding a plasma membrane protein, is a novel regulator of angiogenesis. Myct1
expression is mainly restricted to ECs and tumor ECs. Global and EC-specific (Cdh5-Cre; Myct1f/f) Myct1 KO
mice display decreased tumor angiogenesis and reduced tumor growth. Unexpectedly, defective tumor
angiogenesis leads to an anti-tumor immune microenvironment. Particularly, tumors from Myct1 KO mice contain
more CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) than tumors from littermate control mice. While Myct1 deficient ECs
display defects in EC motility, they support more robust CD8+ T cell trans-endothelial migration (TEM).
Importantly, analysis of human cancers has also identified MYCT1 as a modulator of cancer patients' angiogenic
and immune outcomes. Inhibition of Myct1 through knockout, siRNA treatment, or blocking monoclonal
antibodies, in combination with anti-PD1 antibody, significantly improved complete tumor regression, suggesting
that the better control of cancer depends on reduced angiogenesis and enhanced recruitment of CD8+ CTLs.
We identified that Myct1 could control the outcome of angiogenesis vs. CTL recruitment to tumors through Rhoa
vs. Rac1 Rho GTPase pathways. Moreover, we identified ZO1, also known as tight junction protein 1, to
associate with MYCT1. Deeper mechanistic investigations on the Myct1-Rho GTPases and MYCT1-ZO1
interaction will help better understand how ECs control angiogenesis vs. immunity. As Myct1 function is
conserved between mice and humans, findings from the proposed studies have high translational potential and
can be applied to human anti-cancer therapies. The overall goal is to uncover novel molecular mechanisms and
functions of MYCT1 in ECs and anti-tumor immunity. Particularly, we will test the hypothesis that Myct1 can
modulate EC angiogenesis vs. immune regulatory outcome. Aim 1 determines how Myct1-Rho GTPase
regulates tumor angiogenesis vs. tumor immunity. Aim 2 investigates the functional significance of MYCT1-ZO
in EC permeability and vessel integrity. Aim 3 is to further assess the efficacy of anti-MYCT1 antibodies for
targeting MYCT1 in tumor angiogenesis and growth. By completing the proposed studies, we will gain a deeper
mechanistic understanding of how Myct1 regulates angiogenesis and the consequence of immune output played
by ECs. The outcome will significantly impact the basic EC biology and therapeutic modality for cancer treatment."

Antibody-mediated lymphocyte depletion is a common strategy to eliminate donor-reactive T cells in transplant
recipients. However, memory T cells are more resistant to depletion and have been associated with acute
rejection episodes in transplant recipients treated with polyclonal rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) or anti-
CD52 mAb. Understanding the mechanisms and composition of T cells reconstituted in lymphopenic transplant
recipients is thus critical for the rational use of lymphoablative therapies and for improving their graft-prolonging
efficacy. The ultimate goal of our studies is to develop approaches that minimize homeostatic expansion and
shift the balance towards thymopoiesis, thus avoiding over-immunosuppression. During the previous funding
cycle, we used a murine ATG analog (mATG) in a mouse heart allograft model to establish that homeostatic
reconstitution of the entire T cell compartment is driven by depletion-resistant memory CD4+ T cells via B cells
and CD40/CD154 pathway. While cognate TCR-pMHC interactions between B cells and T cells were
dispensable, we identified posttransplant inflammation and B cell-derived cytokines IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-27 as key
factors facilitating homeostatic T cell recovery. Our preliminary data indicate that signaling through pattern
recognition receptors TLR4, TLR9 and a Macrophage-inducible C-type lectin (Mincle, or Clec4e) is required to
initiate B cell production of proinflammatory cytokines. We further identified innate-like marginal zone (MZ) B
cells acting as initial sensors of posttransplant inflammation in lymphopenic recipients. Genetic deficiency or
specific depletion of MZ B cells markedly delays T cell reconstitution in mATG treated heart allograft recipients.
We hypothesize that inflammation induced by transplantation at the time of lymphoablation promotes rapid T cell
reconstitution. DAMPs released by the graft activate B cells to secrete proinflammatory cytokines that further
amplify B cell activation and directly enhance T cell proliferation. In particular, MZ B cells activated via C-type
lectin receptor Mincle and TLRs act as initial sensors of posttransplant inflammation facilitating proinflammatory
functions of follicular B cells. Therefore, the homeostatic recovery of memory T cells and ensuing allograft
rejection may be decreased by minimizing DAMPs signaling or by targeting MZ B cell activation and functions.
We will test this hypothesis in two Specific Aims: Aim 1. To test the role of MZ B cells as primary sensors of graft
tissue injury in lymphopenic recipients. Aim 2. To investigate the mechanisms by which C-type lectin receptor
Mincle facilitates B cell proinflammatory functions after mATG lymphoablation.
The proposed studies will mechanistically dissect how inflammatory pathways triggered by allograft
ischemia/reperfusion injury drive rapid reconstitution of depletion-resistant memory T cells. Based on these
insights, we will test the efficacy of several clinically relevant approaches for inhibiting recovery of pathogenic
donor-reactive memory T cells and prolonging heart allograft survival in ATG treated recipients."
10878982,"Huntington’s disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expansion of a CAG repeat tract within
the huntingtin (HTT) gene, leading to neuronal death primarily in the striatum and the cortex. The CAG repeat is
highly unstable and patients with longer inherited CAG repeats develop the disease at an earlier age. The repeat
tract is also highly unstable in somatic cells. A high degree of age-dependent somatic expansion of the CAG
repeat is observed in neurons of both the striatum and the cortex of HD patients, but not in unaffected brain
regions like the cerebellum, indicating that somatic CAG repeat expansion is a driver of disease manifestation.
Earlier disease onset is also associated with the length of uninterrupted CAG repeats and a concomitant increase
in somatic instability. These findings further underscore the importance of somatic CAG expansion in disease
manifestation. Recent genome-wide association studies in affected individuals have revealed the existence of
genetic modifiers of the age of onset of the disease; these include several genes of the mismatch repair pathway
(MMR) (MSH3, MLH1, PMS1, and PMS2) as well as FAN1, a DNA interstrand cross-link repair gene.
Independently, studies in mouse models of HD have revealed that genetic knockout of the MMR genes, Msh2,
Msh3, or Mlh1 reduces somatic instability of CAG repeats in the striatum. A role for MMR (the canonical function
of which is to maintain genomic stability) in CAG repeat expansion is further supported by the observation that
proteins in this pathway recognize and process extrahelical DNA extrusions formed by mishybridization of the
two repeat-containing DNA strands. These findings support the view that aberrant MMR of such extrusions
underlies the repeat expansion process. By contrast, knockout of Fan1 in an HD mouse model exacerbates CAG
repeat expansion. We therefore hypothesize that two opposing DNA repair mechanisms act on CAG extrusions.
Because MMR promotes repeat expansion, and FAN1 attenuates CAG expansion, the balance between these
opposing pathways in affected neuronal cells likely determines the rate of repeat expansion and consequently,
disease manifestation. Since the molecular details of either of these processes remains unclear, our overarching
goal is to integrate biochemical, cellular, and phenotypic studies to develop a unified understanding of the
mechanism of tissue/cell type specific CAG repeat expansion. In Aim 1, we will compare and contrast the
molecular features and differing outcomes of the MutSβ- and FAN1- initiated CAG extrusion repair pathways. In
Aim 2, we will determine the functional significance of protein complexes that associate with CAG extrusions. In
Aim 3, we will define the role of PMS1 (as part of the MutLβ heterodimer) in regulation of CAG extrusion repair
and repeat expansion. Completion of these studies will not only shed light on the mechanisms of CAG repeat
expansion in HD, but also will inform our understanding of the emerging role of DNA repair in somatic instability
that underlies other triplet repeat diseases like myotonic dystrophy type 1 and fragile-X related disorders."

Mental health (MH) screening is critical to ensure early identification of youth MH needs. Schools are the most
common setting for MH service delivery to children and adolescents, therefore, improving the capacity of school-
based MH providers to easily access and use validated, high quality MH screening and assessment instruments
to identify students in need of services is a significant public health need. Unfortunately, school health and MH
professionals face several barriers to using validated MH screening tools, including lack of familiarity with and
access to established measures, scoring and interpretation challenges, and limited time and resources to set up
and administer MH assessment. Significant public health impact would be realized by investing resources in
evidence-based screening and assessment technology products that are feasible, affordable, and usable for
schools. The goal of this Direct to Phase II SBIR is to increase access to and use of established high quality MH
and MH-related assessment measures in schools. We will develop the SHARE (Student Health Assessment,
Response, and Evaluation) software system through iterative, user-centered testing. SHARE will be designed to
overcome logistical (e.g., cost, time) and implementation (e.g., administration, scoring) barriers that limit use of
available measures, so schools can feasibly implement MH screening and assessment on a routine basis and,
ultimately, narrow the gap in access to MH care for youth. This SBIR will further the successful collaboration of
3C Institute and the National Center for School Mental Health (NCSMH). 3C brings essential skills in how to build
easy-to-use, feasible technology products for schools, including research-driven platforms for online data
collection with youth, meaningful data displays, and integrated decision aids, along with an established
technology infrastructure to ensure secure data collection, transfer, and storage. NCSMH brings a nationwide
network of thousands of SMH administrators and providers through its School Health Assessment and
Performance Evaluation System (SHAPE) along with essential research and clinical expertise in SMH
assessment and services, including developing data-driven decision supports to improve SMH services. This
foundational work and collaboration provide an unparalleled opportunity to successfully move the proposed
SHARE product to market and in so doing, quickly provide schools with an effective means to assess their
students’ MH needs and elevate the quality of SMH services. Our Direct to Phase II project will accomplish three
specific aims: (1) create the fully functional SHARE software system through iterative user-centered tests, (2)
conduct a field test with SMH providers and youth, and (3) conduct a pilot test of the full SHARE system with
SMH providers, school-level administrators, and district-level administrators. Our end goal is to elevate the
quality of SMH services which, in turn, has the potential for broad-reaching public health impact for youth and
families."

The goal of the proposed work is to develop a molecular level, structural understanding of the role of
amelogenin in directing the hierarchical growth of enamel. Enamel is one of the hardest biominerals known,
and is hierarchically structured to prevent crack propagation, allowing it to last many people a lifetime.
However, naturally occurring diseases or damage do occur to enamel and our current therapies fall far short of
nature made enamel. Over the past decade we have come to understand that amelogenin assembles into
quaternary structures as oligomers containing 12 proteins, units which further assemble into nanospheres.
These assemblies, the molecular level interactions governing them, their interactions with calcium phosphate,
and their role in mineral phase transformations, are not well understood for enamel formation. We do know
that the protein amelogenin, the predominant protein in the forming enamel milieu, is critical in formation
based on amelogenin null mouse models showing severely damaged enamel phenotypes. Protein structure
often dictates function, yet we have only begun to reveal the structure of amelogenin. Further, the mineral in
the enamel milieu begins as ions, and transitions through an amorphous stage prior to becoming elongated,
crystallized HAP needles. Both in vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated that amelogenin controls this
phase transformation process, but the structural, spatial, and temporal aspects of this process are not
understood. In our proposed work, we bring a set of advanced characterization techniques to an in vitro system
simulating developing enamel to evaluate the structure of amelogenin when interacting with calcium
phosphates, to understand the spatial distribution of amelogenin around developing calcium phosphate mineral
ribbons, and to develop a molecular level view of the transformation process from calcium phosphate clusters,
through the amorphous phase, on to crystalline HAP. This suite of techniques has never been brought to bear
on understanding the challenge of enamel growth and will result in an understanding of the development of
enamel that is currently lacking. The results of this work are relevant to biomineralization systems in general
and may ultimately inform more robust therapeutics for enamel replacements."

Many alpha-proteobacteria invade cells of eukaryotic hosts with pathogenic or beneficial outcomes. Examples
of such alpha-proteobacteria are the human pathogens Brucella and Bartonella and the plant symbiont
Sinorhizobium. Remarkably, although these alpha-proteobacteria target different cell types in different hosts,
they all require a conserved bacterial two-component signaling pathway for successful host interaction:
BvrS/BvrR in Brucella, BatS/BatR in Bartonella, and ExoS/ChvI in Sinorhizobium. Mutant bacteria deficient in
this pathway fail to invade host cells and exhibit pleiotropic phenotypes such as altered cell envelope function.
However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these defects are not well understood. Toward elucidating the
crucial roles of this conserved signaling pathway, this project focuses on the ExoS/ChvI signaling pathway of
Sinorhizobium meliloti, a model alpha-proteobacterium for studying interactions with eukaryotic hosts. A recent
genome-wide study identified 64 protein-encoding genes in the ExoS/ChvI regulon of S. meliloti. This proposal
builds from that study and uses molecular genetic approaches to clarify the critical functions of this conserved
regulatory pathway. Specific aims of the project are to: (1) Identify small RNA genes directly regulated by
ExoS/ChvI, (2) Identify regulatory inputs to ExoS/ChvI, and (3) Characterize transcriptional target genes of
ExoS/ChvI. This study will provide insight into the functions controlled by this important signaling pathway
during host interaction. In addition, the project will provide valuable biomedical research training to
undergraduate and master’s students, including those from groups underrepresented in biomedical research
careers."
10884869,"1 PROJECT SUMMARY
 2 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly metastatic malignancy and the third-leading cause of
 3 cancer-related death in adults. A majority of patients who undergo surgery for primary PDAC resection will later
 4 develop lethal metastases, despite intra-operative examination confirming the absence of macrometastatic
 5 lesions. Liver metastases constitute nearly half of recurrences detected within six months after PDAC resection,
 6 which is significantly earlier in the postoperative period compared to other metastatic sites. Several clinical and
 7 experimental studies have shown that perioperative inflammation, including infectious complications like sepsis,
 8 can promote liver metastasis. This is intriguing because bacterial-derived endotoxin is elevated in PDAC patient
 9 plasma during tumor resection. Furthermore, PDAC patients are at increased risk of developing sepsis, which
10 suggests that tumor-systemic communication in part rewires systemic immunity and, consequently, sepsis
11 susceptibility. Despite these observations, we currently lack mechanistic studies investigating the relationship
12 between perioperative inflammation and PDAC liver metastasis. The overarching objective of this project is to
13 determine how pro-metastatic immune responses can be suppressed to protect against liver metastasis during
14 PDAC resection and sepsis-induced inflammation. To define how sepsis-induced inflammation impacts the liver
15 immune microenvironment, I first modeled the perioperative inflammation that PDAC patients may experience
16 during surgery by using the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) model of sterile endotoxemia, and the more clinically
17 relevant cecal and ligation puncture (CLP) model of polymicrobial sepsis. My preliminary data demonstrates that
18 performing CLP prior to seeding PDAC cells in the liver had a pro-metastatic effect. However, LPS challenge
19 had an anti-metastatic effect marked by increased CXCL9 and CXCL10 release and natural killer cell infiltration
20 in the liver during early sepsis response. Therefore, this approach presents an exciting opportunity to define how
21 LPS-induced sepsis elicits an anti-metastatic cascade to reduce liver metastasis. The central hypothesis of this
22 project is that determining how sepsis-induced immune responses influence liver metastasis will reveal critical
23 mechanisms that can be targeted to create a protective ‘anti-metastatic niche’. To test this hypothesis, Aim 1 will
24 elucidate the anti-metastatic signaling mechanisms underpinning LPS-induced sepsis, and uncover potential
25 therapeutic targets that can be exploited to reduce PDAC liver metastasis. Aim 2 will examine the therapeutic
26 potential of targeting pro-metastatic inflammation during sepsis by evaluating how the quality of sepsis-induced
27 immune responses are impacted by systemic immunosuppression, which is a well-established hallmark of
28 PDAC. The findings of these experiments will uncover critical regulators of perioperative inflammation and
29 systemic immunosuppression in PDAC, and set the stage for the development of preventative therapies to
30 reduce the incidence of liver metastasis among resected PDAC patients."
10811595,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a frequent cause of nosocomial infections and life-
threatening lung infections in people with the genetic disorder cystic fibrosis. P. aeruginosa infections are difficult
and costly to treat due to inherent and acquired antibiotic resistance, underscoring the need for new treatments.
A better understanding of how P. aeruginosa causes infections will be instrumental for this. P. aeruginosa
survives in a human host and causes disease by producing multiple virulence factors. One such virulence factor,
the serine protease PrpL, causes severe tissue damage and degrades components of the immune system.
Expression of prpL is regulated by two environmental factors experienced by P. aeruginosa during an infection:
low iron availability and temperature. Expression of prpL is upregulated by low iron availability through a known
mechanism and downregulated at 37C compared to 25C through an unknown mechanism. The Goldberg Lab
has found that the transcription factors MvaT/MvaU and LasR are required for this prpL thermoregulation, but
the mechanism of prpL thermoregulation remains to be fully elucidated. How iron and temperature coregulate
prpL and the importance of this for P. aeruginosa virulence is also unknown. Given that low iron availability
upregulates prpL while 37C conditions downregulate it, iron and temperature may balance PrpL production and
be important for P. aeruginosa virulence. Based on these findings, I hypothesize that thermoregulation of
prpL occurs through temperature-dependent binding of MvaT/MvaU and LasR to the prpL promoter and
that iron/temperature coregulation of prpL is important for P. aeruginosa virulence. I will test this
hypothesis using genetic and biochemical approaches, and an animal model of infection. In Aim 1, I will define
the prpL thermoregulatory mechanism by determining if MvaT/MvaU and LasR positively or negatively regulate
prpL transcription at 25C and 37C, and by characterizing the impact of temperature on the binding of
MvaT/MvaU and LasR to the prpL promoter. In Aim 2, I will determine how temperatures balances production
and activity of PrpL by measuring prpL gene expression, the amount of PrpL secreted, and the total enzymatic
activity of secreted PrpL across a 20C-42C range. In Aim 3, I will characterize the role of prpL iron/temperature
coregulation in P. aeruginosa virulence by infecting larvae of the moth Galleria mellonella. Larvae will be infected
with a P. aeruginosa strain in which prpL is regulated by low iron availability and a strain in which prpL is not,
and larvae from both groups will be housed at 25C and 37C to measure how iron and temperature coregulation
of prpL affects P. aeruginosa virulence. A mechanistic study of prpL thermoregulation will address a major gap
in the knowledge of virulence factor thermoregulation in P. aeruginosa. Understanding how PrpL is regulated by
temperature and iron to facilitate P. aeruginosa pathogenesis will also provide insights into how this opportunistic
pathogen survives inside a human and causes problematic infections. Such insights could contribute to the
development of new treatments for P. aeruginosa infections and improved care for infected patients."

 Environmental temperature dictates biology. Animals use their thermal environments to guide their
migration, circadian rhythms, growth, feeding, and sex determination: essential behaviors now threatened by
changing climates. Warming temperatures likewise challenge human health. About 1 in 100 deaths globally stem
from heat-related causes, and such mortality is rising. Beyond lethal heatstroke, more mild heat affects human
health in far more common and pervasive ways. Heat <40°C alters and dysregulates human physiology down to
the cellular level, particularly in immune cells. Such sublethal heat shocks occur in hyperthermia and heat illness,
as well as frequently in fever: a systemic heat shock which regulates the immune system during infection. Yet
even in the well-known context of fever, we lack understanding of how human cells sense sublethal heat shock.
 The cell biology of extreme heat shock >40°C is well-characterized, but far less is understood about
sublethal, fever-range temperatures <40°C. However, we do know that certain immune cells upregulate heat
shock protein expression in response to fever. The induction of heat shock proteins, or the heat shock response,
occurs in eukaryotes when heat activates transcription factor Hsf1, via titration of its repressor (heat shock protein
Hsp70) away from Hsf1. This titration is caused by the generation of new, heat shock-induced substrates for
Hsp70 to bind. These substrates, i.e. the upstream sensors of heat, are unidentified in sublethal heat shock.
 We hypothesize biomolecular condensates are these substrates which help cells sense sublethal heat
shock. Condensation, or reorganization of proteins and RNA into larger foci, occurs in response to environmental
stimuli across species from yeast to humans. Our group showed recently that heat-induced condensates are
Hsp70 substrates in yeast. We hypothesize that sublethal heat shock-induced condensates are Hsp70
substrates in humans, enabling cells to sense and respond to such fever-range temperatures. It is not known
what proteins condense in human cells at these temperatures, nor if such condensates might be Hsp70
substrates. Moreover, in any species, we lack molecular-scale understanding of how condensates and Hsp70
interact. We are poised to unlock exactly this knowledge using a complement of biochemical, microscopic, and
molecular-level approaches. First, we will uncover protein condensation in human cell lines at fever-range
temperature, using the established sedimentation-mass spectrometry method of our group. Second, we will
observe directly how condensates and Hsp70 interact at the molecular scale, using single-molecule microscopy.
Together, these aims will help us elucidate fundamentally how cells sense and respond to sublethal heat shock."

During development of the human brain, synaptic connections undergo intensive rewiring in order to form
mature circuits. Disruption of developmental remodeling in humans is linked to neurological disorders such as
schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders. The goal of this project is to identify conserved mechanisms that
direct synapse remodeling. The ease of genetics, couple with the simpler organization and invariant
architecture of invertebrate nervous systems offer strong advantages for studies of neuronal remodeling. My
work focuses on the remodeling of GABAergic dorsal D-class (DD) motor neurons in the nemaode
Caenorhabditis elegans. Prior studies have largely focused on the remodeling of presynaptic terminals. In
contrast, my preliminary work has focused on understanding mechanisms that direct the elimination of
postsynaptic receptors during remodeling. post-synaptic domain. The Francis lab previously demonstrated that
the homeodomain transcription factor dve-1 is required for synapse elimination in GABA neurons. My work
focuses on two putative DVE-1 targets, the calcineurin-like EF-hand protein CHP1/chpf-1 and the regulatory
subunit of CalciNeurin PPP3R1/cnb-1, that were shown to be downregulated in dve-1 mutants. My preliminary
studies suggest that mutation of either cnb-1 or chpf-1 disrupt synapse elimination during remodeling. My
proposed work will determine the functional requirement and site of action for cnb-1, and identify the
contribution of calcineurin phosphatase and proteasomal function to synapse elimination (Aim 1). In Aim 2, I
will define how chpf-1 contributes to synapse elimination and maintenance. In Aim 3, I will identify additional
potential targets of dve-1 in the remodeling pathway by using neuron-specific RNA-seq. My proposed work will
advance our understanding of remodeling and the mechanisms of regulation, potentially providing targets for
future exploration."

We propose the continuation of an established Clinical Research Unit (CRU) towards the success of an
established NIDDK-sponsored Diabetic Foot Consortium (DFC). The overall objective of the CRU, established
during the previous cycle, was to participate in multi-site clinical research to validate biomarkers for diabetic foot
ulcer (DFU) care. Six CRU were funded in cycle 1 (DFC1.0), including IU, of which, four remain as active sites for
the ongoing DFC studies. This CRU is high performing per objective metrices presented. This CRU is also a
competitively awarded Biomarker Analysis Unit (BAU) – home to the TEWL (Trans-Epidermal Water Loss) study.
The TEWL study enrolled the first DFC subject on June 17, 2020, at this CRU. This proposal to renew the IN
CRU is aimed at maintaining and exceeding our performance during DFC1.0 which was limited by the pandemic.
We are currently the only site with an active CRU, Biomarker Analysis Unit (BAU) and R61/R33- all of which
have been independently competitively awarded as part of the DFC. During DFC1.0, IU introduced the inclusion
of two local satellite sites within the IU infrastructure as a pilot effort to gauge the impact on patient recruitment
and sustainability of managing multiple sites. With supplemental funding support from the DFC, these sites
added to the overall productivity of the IU CRU and led to the addition of a third site (Podiatry Associates, IN)
outside the IU infrastructure. For cycle 2 (DFC2.0), we will continue to leverage our local resources and expertise
and build new satellite network connections to address the following three specific aims: Aim 1. Provide
continued wound healing expertise and an efficient clinical and scientific infrastructure to develop evidentiary
criteria for qualifying/validating the targeted Diabetic Foot Ulcer (DFU) biomarkers. 1.1 CRU leaders with strong
record of basic/clinical/translation research in wound healing. 1.2 Patient populations with DFU, current and
further advancement of local Standards of Care. 1.3 Evaluate impact of Social Determinants of Health (SDH) for
DFU healing and recurrence. 1.4 Leadership and implementation of the Satellite Pilot Program (SPP). Aim 2.
Identify, enroll, and retain patients with DFU. 2.1 Subject identification and enrollment. 2.2 Use patient-centered
strategies to recruit and retain targeted DFU patients. 2.3 Ensure timely completion of current cycle protocols
(TEWL and c-Myc). 2.4 Ensure efficient conduct and monitoring of ongoing biorepository protocol. 2.5 Ensure
efficient study protocol start-up, conduct and monitoring of new R61/33 ancillary protocols. 2.6 Collect, store
and ship DFU biosamples. 2.7 Ensure the safety and rights of all trial participants through efficient scheduling
and completion of all study procedures and clinical center visits. Aim 3. Support established CRU administration
to achieve continued Diabetic Foot Consortium (DFC) readiness 3.1 Support established leadership plan and
functional areas of responsibilities. 3.2 Communications & fostering interactions. 3.3 Travel. 3.4 Succession plan,
cross-training, and back-up personnel. This CRU is firmly committed to the overall success of the DFC which is
a NIH program of transformative significance in DFU care and therefore minimization of amputation."

 We have entered a new era in which the explosion of genomic and biological information
across multiple developmental and metabolic states is poised to transform the practice of
medicine. The clinician’s ability to absorb, assimilate and translate this information will
determine the extent of its impact on public health. There is an urgent need to train clinical and
non-clinical scientists who are competent on big biological data, and who can curate,
disseminate and implement the clinically actionable findings that emerge from ongoing efforts.
The PI on this application has dedicated himself to advance genomic and metabolomic
discoveries in type 2 diabetes and related metabolic traits, and during the first funding cycle of
this award generated resources and established a training pipeline at the Massachusetts
General Hospital (MGH) and Broad Institute. He now seeks to continue attracting and mentoring
a cadre of highly trained investigators who will be enabled and empowered to lead the
application of genomic and systems-wide approaches to the clinical setting. To achieve this
goal, he will 1) expand the infrastructure of pertinent genomic and physiologic datasets available
for mining, 2) maintain a rigorous yet nurturing training pipeline of carefully selected mentees,
and 3) guide the investigation of clinically relevant hypotheses that can be tested in the ideal
environment. Dr. Florez is embedded in a successful and productive milieu that embraces a
culture of collaboration. As the Chief of the Endocrine Division and member of the Center for
Genomic Medicine at the MGH and an Institute Member at the Broad Institute, he is placed in a
unique position that will enable him and his trainees to benefit from direct access to an
unparalleled suite of training resources and datasets germane to the proposed patient-oriented
research in cardiometabolic disease."
10932192,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The dystonias are a group of disorders characterized by excessive involuntary muscle contractions leading to
spasms and abnormal movements. Any region of the body may be affected. One of the most commonly affected
regions is the upper face, leading to blepharospasm (BL). Patients experience a number of distinct but
overlapping problems that include spasms of the muscles around the eyes, excessive blinking, eyelid fluttering,
impaired eyelid opening, and spread to the lower face or jaw. Traditionally, BL has been viewed as a relatively
homogeneous disorder, differing only in grades of severity. However, there is increasing evidence that BL is not
a homogeneous disorder. For example, recent cluster analyses including large numbers of patients have
provided evidence for phenotypically distinct subgroups. Clinically, it has been recognized for some time that
some subtypes of BL are more difficult to treat than others. There also is evidence that the core symptoms of
BL have different pathogenic mechanisms. Thus, there already is strong evidence for etiological heterogeneity.
Despite the importance of these different clinical manifestations, there are no tools for distinguishing and
measuring them. Future clinical and scientific studies of BL require more sophisticated tools to discriminate the
distinct phenotypic elements of BL. These tools are fundamental needs to improve diagnosis and treatment of
the different subtypes of BL, to monitor outcomes of clinical trials for BL, and to provide richer and more
meaningful phenotypic data in in support of studies of the pathophysiologic underpinnings of BL. The studies of
this proposal describe the development of a novel simple clinical rating scale to separately quantify the distinct
features of BL in the clinic, a novel an unobtrusive wearable device for rigorous discrimination and quantification
of these features, and preliminary characterization of potential blood-based biomarkers for the disorder."
10914871,"During the first meiotic division, homologous chromosomes linked by chiasmata attach to microtubules from opposite spindle poles (bi-orientation) and then segregate. In humans, errors in chromosome segregation in the oocyte lead to aneuploidy and are the leading cause of miscarriage, infertility and birth defects. Our long-term goal is to understand the mechanisms that promote accurate chromosome segregation, and the features of the oocyte spindle that make it susceptible to chromosome segregation errors. Our previous research using Drosophila melanogaster females has led to a model in which two types of microtubule attachment are used for bi-orientation. Lateral attachments, where the kinetochores interact with the sides of microtubules, establish bi-orientation. Then end-on attachments, where the kinetochores attach to the end of microtubules, maintain and segregate bi-orientated homologs. A prominent feature of the Drosophila oocyte is the metaphase I central spindle, which functions as a “backbone”, organizing the microtubules into a bipolar structure in the absence of centrosomes. Our work has shown that the central spindle has an important role in bi-orientation during pro-metaphase. Studies in C. elegans and mouse oocytes indicate that the metaphase central spindle may be a conserved element required for the bi-orientation of homologous chromosomes during acentrosomal meiosis. In the previous funding period, we developed several tools to study the mechanisms of bi- orientation in oocytes. These tools include RNAi resistant transgenes in order to make germline-specific mutants of key proteins. Furthermore, we have the reagents, either transgenes or antibodies, to detect many of the important proteins that regulate chromosome segregation, including centromere, kinetochore, checkpoint and spindle proteins. With these tools, we will investigate the mechanisms by which the central spindle interacts with the kinetochores to promote bi-orientation. It is likely that premature stabilization of end-on attachments leads to bi-orientation defects. Therefore, we will investigate the mechanisms of lateral attachments and bi-orientation, and how the transition to end-on attachments is regulated. These studies will focus on two kinetochore proteins, CENP-C and SPC105R, which are required to load several other kinetochore and checkpoint proteins. We will also investigate how the central spindle interacts with the kinetochores and promotes accurate bi-orientation. These studies will include experiments to model in Drosophila, central spindle mutations that decrease fertility in human females. The Aims of this proposal are linked by a goal to understand the mechanisms of chromosome segregation important to oocytes. In completing this work, we will have gained insights into how kinetochores regulate the transition from lateral and end-on microtubule attachment."
10915630,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Pediatric traumatic injury (i.e., injury of sudden onset and severity requiring immediate attention) is the leading
cause of death and morbidity among US adolescents and are associated with mental health and health risk
outcomes. Pediatric traumatic injuries are associated with medical and societal costs of $87 billion and
elevates risk for a wide range of health risk consequences that affect quality of life, physical recovery, social
functioning, and return to previous activities. The prevalence of PTSD and depression is high among pediatric
traumatic injury patients; however, most pediatric trauma centers don’t have the resources to implement
models of care that address mental health following injury. Current guidelines by the American College of
Surgeons (ACS) Committee on Trauma strongly recommend screening and addressing emotional recovery in
traumatic injury patients. The ACS Committee on Trauma has identified this as a priority and likely will begin to
mandate mental health programs in Level I and II pediatric trauma centers nationally. It is therefore critical that
policy and practice is guided by the implementation and evaluation of scalable and sustainable models of care.
In 2015 our team launched the Trauma Resilience and Recovery Program (TRRP), a scalable and sustainable,
technology-enhanced, multidisciplinary stepped model of care – one of the few in the US - that provides early
intervention and direct services to improve access to evidence-based mental health care after traumatic injury
for children, adults and families. We have found this model of care to be feasible and acceptable to adolescent
patients (ages 12-17) at each level of service. TRRP includes 3 major steps: (1) in-hospital education, brief risk
reduction session, and tracking patients’ emotional recovery via an automated text-messaging system, (2)
conducting a 30-day screen via telephone to identify patients who are good candidates for psychological
treatment, and (3) providing referral to best-practice telehealth-based or in-person assessment and treatment.
We have partnered with three accredited Level I and II pediatric trauma centers and propose a multi-site hybrid
1 effectiveness-implementation trial with 300 adolescent (ages 12-17) traumatic injury patients to: 1) assess
the extent to which TRRP promotes improvement in quality of life and emotional recovery and 2) gather
preliminary data on the potential for TRRP to be implemented in other Level I trauma centers. Directly in line
with NICHD’s Pediatric Trauma and Critical Illness Research and Training (PTCIB) Strategic Research and
Training agenda, this study will provide valuable data on the efficacy, preliminary effectiveness and potential
for implementation of an innovative, cost-effective, sustainable technology-enhanced intervention designed to
address the unique needs of adolescent injury patients and mitigate short- and long-term impact of injury on
mental health, quality of life, and overall well-being."
10900817,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among military Veterans is a critical public health concern. Veteran suicide
rates exceed those of the general population, with the disorder creating a mental health challenge that is costly
and debilitating. The majority of Veterans with PTSD also have comorbid mental health diagnoses, such as
generalized anxiety disorder, substance abuse disorder, and major depression. The treatment of Veteran PTSD
and comorbid disorders represents an important therapeutic and rehabilitation problem. The disorder is complex
and difficult to treat, with high treatment dropout and nonresponse rates spurring some Veterans to seek
complementary integrative health strategies. One promising complementary strategy is the provision of a trained
service dog. Initial evidence across multiple research groups highlights service dogs as a promising complement
to evidence-based practices that can offer short-term improvements. However, the long-term effectiveness,
mechanisms of action, and moderators of efficacy remain largely unknown. Thus, the overarching objective of
this proposal is to understand how, why, and for whom PTSD service dogs are most effective.
To address this objective, the present project will assess the longitudinal efficacy and dose-response curve of
service dogs for Veteran PTSD symptomology and psychosocial functioning (Aim 1). To understand how and
why the intervention works, this project will also implement theory-driven quantification of potential mechanisms
of action that may mediate service dog efficacy (Aim 2). Finally, to understand for whom and under what
circumstances the intervention works best, this project will define moderators of service dog efficacy by
examining the heterogeneity of treatment effects (Aim 3). The research design will consist of a two-arm,
randomized clinical trial (RCT) with longitudinal assessments at 0, 6, and 12 months. Assessments will consist
of comprehensive monitoring across six data streams, including: (1) blinded clinician assessment of PTSD
symptomology, (2) standardized surveys of psychosocial functioning, (3) ecological momentary assessment of
daily emotional experiences and activities, (4) salivary biomarkers of two major stress response systems via
cortisol and alpha-amylase, (5) physical activity and sleep via actigraphy-based wristband monitoring, and (6)
canine assessments of behavior, temperament, and physiological co-regulation with the human partner. Results
are expected to elucidate the clinical impact of service dogs for military Veterans with PTSD, as well as the
biobehavioral mechanisms of action and characteristics that moderate efficacy. These outcomes will support the
long-term goal of accelerating complementary and integrative health interventions, through optimized and
evidence-based service dog interventions. As such, this project will further advance the scientific understanding
of human-animal interactions for psychosocial health."
10909045,"SUMMARY
Modern antiretroviral therapy has brought about significantly increased life expectancies for persons living with
HIV/AIDS (PLWH). However, the effort to reduce the occurrence of cardiovascular disease and various
malignancies in this population remains an important public health priority. Arguably, the most effective way to
prevent these diseases in PLWH would be to reduce the prevalence of cigarette smoking. Despite the
significant need, relatively few smoking cessation trials with PLWH appear in the literature. Thus, efforts to
develop and evaluate sustainable, low cost evidence-based cessation interventions for smokers with HIV are
needed. Given the widespread proliferation of mobile phones, the potential of using mHealth applications to
improve the reach and efficacy of cessation interventions is promising, but evidence of efficacy is lacking,
particularly among PLWH. With these needs in mind, the overarching purpose of the proposed project is to
evaluate a fully automated smartphone intervention for HIV+ smokers. Participants (n=500) will be randomized
to one of two treatment conditions: 1) Standard Treatment (ST, n=250) or Automated Video-Assisted
Smoking Treatment (AVAST, n=250). ST participants will be electronically connected to state quitline-
delivered cessation treatment, consisting of proactive phone counseling plus nicotine replacement therapy
(NRT) in the form of transdermal patches. This approach, frequently referred to as Ask Advise Connect (AAC),
was developed by our team and has been successfully implemented in numerous health systems. ST will be
compared to AVAST, a fully automated treatment delivery approach. In the AVAST condition, participants will
receive NRT plus an interactive smartphone-based intervention that comprises individually tailored audio/video
and text content. Foundational programming and developmental work for AVAST has already been completed
by the Stephenson Cancer Center's mHealth Shared Resource, and results from a series of pilot studies
(including extensive work conducted at both proposed HIV clinic recruitment sites) with beta versions of the
mobile application and data management system are extremely encouraging. The major goal of this project is
to determine if AVAST performs better, in terms of facilitating long-term smoking abstinence (i.e., biochemically
verified abstinence 12 months post-enrollment), than the more resource-intensive ST approach. If efficacy is
established, the AVAST approach will be readily adoptable by various HIV clinic and community-based
organizations, and offer an efficient way to allocate limited public health resources to tobacco control
interventions. The primary aim is to evaluate the efficacy of AVAST for facilitating smoking cessation among
PLWH. Secondary aims include: 1) exploring potential mediators and moderators, and 2) conducting economic
evaluations to assess the cost and cost-effectiveness of AVAST. In sum, there is a critical need for efficacious,
cost-effective, and sustainable cessation treatments for PLWH who smoke tobacco. The proposed AVAST
intervention has been designed to help fill this need."

and mental health outcomes in elementary school children. Aim 1. Sleep and greenspace.
Determine how green space utilization (GPS-derived measures of daily activity and
environmental features) is related to sleep (duration, timing, regularity) in children. Hypothesis
1.1 Children spending more time in greenspace as derived by GPS (i.e., utilization) will have
earlier, longer and more regular sleep than children spending less time in greenspace.
Hypothesis 1.2. Greenspace utilization will influence sleep through increased light exposure,
higher levels of physical activity measured using accelerometry, and lower levels of stress
measured by IL-1 beta. Aim 2. Mental health, greenspace and sleep. Determine whether
greenspace utilization is associated with mental health and wellbeing via sleep behaviors.
Hypothesis 2.1: Children spending more time in greenspace will have fewer mental health
symptoms as measured by validated PROMIS® measures of anxiety, cognitive functioning,
psychological stress and wellbeing compared to children spending less time in greenspace.
Hypothesis 2.2: Greenspace utilization will influence mental health and well-being through
sleep behavior (duration, timing, regularity) assessed using actigraphy. Aim 3. Exploratory
Aim. Greenspace, epigenetics, sleep and wellbeing. Explore the potential epigenetic
contribution of greenspace on sleep and wellbeing in children. Exploratory Hypothesis 1.1.
Patterns of differential DNA methylation between high and low greenspace users may differ in
genes associated with stress response, inadequate sleep, light exposure, or physical activity.
We will work in Rhode Island, which is currently engaged in expanding access to tree-canopy
across the entire state – a unique designation in the US. Thus, the health and policy
implications of our study is timely, and can have implications for other states interested in
exploring the use green space to improve health among children and their families."

Boards to ensure that goals are fully evaluated and ultimately achieved. During the current period,
Developmental Funds were utilized to assist in the recruitment of 24 faculty members, with each of the BCC
Research Programs benefitting from strategic recruitment (8 in Cancer Biology Program (CBP); 8 in Targets,
Modulators and Delivery Program (TMDP); 8 in GI Cancer Program (GICP)). In addition to providing financial
support to these 24 recruits, 17 members were allocated BCC research space by the Director. Of the 24 BCC

The Buffett Cancer Center (BCC) has established a process by which proposed BCC clinical and population
science research protocols undergo internal peer review for scientific merit and prioritization prior to University
of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) Institutional Review Board approval. The BCC SRC is a multidisciplinary
committee charged with overseeing the scientific aspects of cancer-related research involving human subjects
conducted by members of the UNMC faculty and students, and BCC Members. Cancer prevention studies,
screening trials, behavioral studies, quality of life / survivorship studies, and interventional trials that rely on
collection of patient-reported outcomes are reviewed by the SRC. The BCC SRC has the authority to approve,
require modifications, or disapprove research activities that fall within its jurisdiction. The SRC confirms the
scientific validity of the proposed study, and assesses the feasibility of the study relative to the availability of
human subjects and ongoing protocols based on enrollments from that same or patient and/or subject
population. The BCC SRC review also assures that the data and safety monitoring plan for the proposed
clinical trial is appropriate and in accordance with regulations, and provides feedback and recommendations to
the investigator, to enhance the scientific merit and/or the logistics of the planned study. Initial review includes
two stages, beginning with preliminary review and approval by the Disease Focused Teams (DFTs) followed
by the SRC review. National, Externally Peer Reviewed and Multi-Institutional studies with an approved NCI
Designated or Comprehensive Center as the lead site, received expedited review, which focuses on priority
and feasibility. The BCC SRC members are selected to represent the broad spectrum of oncology research.
The BCC SRC has broad expertise with representation from Medical, Surgical, Pediatric and Radiation
Oncology, Pharmacology, Pathology, Nursing and Biostatistics. The Committee also has broad expertise in
hematological malignancies and solid tumors, as well as in clinical research in supportive care and symptom
management. Any Cancer Center member with expertise specific to a particular protocol may also be asked to
serve as an at-large or ad-hoc reviewer based on their unique qualifications or when expertise is not available

10927377,"PROJECT SUMMARY: SHARED RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
We propose to manage and provide support (space, funds, personnel) to eight Cancer Center Support Grant
(CCSG)-supported Shared Resources (Flow Cytometry, Advanced Microscopy, Structural Biology, Molecular
Biology, Pathology, Preclinical Imaging, Bioinformatics, and Biostatistics) that are necessary and highly utilized
by Cancer Center members. Shared Resources supported by the CCSG are configured and managed to provide
access to specialized state-of-the-art technologies, services, and expertise that enhance scientific interaction
and productivity in the Fred and Pamela Buffett Cancer Center (BCC) in a manner that ensures stability, reliability,
cost-effectiveness, and quality control of these services. The Director of the BCC, Dr. Cowan, makes final
decisions regarding the allocation of CCSG resources (space, funds, personnel) to Shared Resources. Dr.
Cowan is assisted by the Associate Director for Basic Research, Dr. Michael A. (Tony) Hollingsworth, who
manages policies and practices to ensure an effective and fair process for setting scientific and other priorities
regarding CCSG Shared Resource support and usage, and assuring accessibility to members across campuses.
Fiscal management and day-to-day administrative support for the Shared Resources is provided by Mr. Matthew
Winfrey, the Associate Director for Administration and External Affairs. Shared Resources supported by the
BCC are a subset of many Shared Resources available at UNMC and all Shared Resources supported by the
BCC are also supported in part by the Institution (UNMC), which allows us to leverage CCSG funds with
institutional assets and support. Our management plan for all resources is cooperative and collaborative with the
institutional oversight of UNMC-wide resources, which is housed in the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research
(VCR), Dr. Jennifer Larsen. To ensure that supported shared resources are most effectively meeting the
research services needs of its members, the Buffett Cancer Center employs regular user satisfaction surveys to
evaluate quality, timeliness, upcoming needs, and comprehensiveness of shared resource service. Also,
communication from users regarding Shared Resource functionality is encouraged on an ongoing as-needed
basis for problems that arise in the daily operations of the resource. Dr. Hollingsworth and Mr. Winfrey conduct
an annual review of Shared Resources with each Manager (and associated personnel that conduct cancer
related activities). On an annual basis, subsequent to receiving results of the UNMC-wide and Cancer Center
specific surveys, reports of internal advisory boards, notes from presentations, and direct feedback from users,
Dr. Hollingsworth and Mr. Winfrey meet with the leaders of each Shared Resource to review usage, ongoing
and completed cancer related research projects, publications, grant support, quality and user satisfaction. We
also solicit input from each user and resource leader regarding the need for improvement in equipment,
personnel, or resources in order to maintain the state-of-the-art functional status for each facility. As part of the
surveys of users and managers, Cancer Center members are asked to identify current and anticipated needs
with respect to capabilities within the shared resources. Suggestions for new or enhanced resources are
reviewed and prioritized by leadership in the Cancer Center, including Program Leaders, Associate Directors,

10927389,"PROJECT SUMMARY: BIOINFORMATICS SHARED RESOURCE
Bioinformatics has become an essential part of cancer research due to the high-throughput nature of multi-
omics data (such as genetic, genomic, epigenetic, transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic) that are being
generated from cancer research projects. Thus, a tremendous need exists for developing computational
infrastructure for the collection, processing, storage, analysis, and facilitation of the use of such data by the
cancer research community. The main goals of the Bioinformatics and Systems Biology (BSB) Shared
Resource are to facilitate access to bioinformatics resources that include hardware, software and personnel
expertise; train researchers in the use of such resources; and provide custom support for research projects
including the development of cutting-edge tools and protocols to match the rapidly changing technologies in
the realm of cancer research. BSB Shared Resource is equipped with locally installed bioinformatics tools and
databases related to cancer research backed by state-of-the-art computational and storage infrastructure. In
addition to an extensive collection of trusted open-source tools, the Shared Resource will also provide access
to several licensed bioinformatic software tools such as Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, CLC Genomics
Workbench, Partek Flow, Schrodinger Molecular Drug Discovery suite, and BioCyc Database Collection.
Similarly, the computational infrastructure includes dedicated servers for data storage, high-performance
computing, database and web development and optional cloud computing. The Shared Resource offers a wide
range of bioinformatics services that fall into five thematic areas including (i) analysis of next-generation
sequencing (NGS)-based genomics data; (ii) analysis of array-based and systems biology data; (iii) machine-
learning, big-data analysis and precision medicine research; (iv) development of software and database
applications for bioinformatics projects; and (v) support for experimental design and grant consultation. In the
past funding cycle, the Shared Resource has supported several hundred distinct research projects with over a
third of the Shared Resource users hailing from the Fred and Pamela Buffett Cancer Center (BCC). The
Shared Resource Director is assisted by four well-trained support staff with diverse training backgrounds in
computer programming, statistics, cancer genomics, and systems biology. An advisory board that consists of
members representing different colleges at UNMC oversees the Shared Resource policies and procedures and
makes recommendations. The Shared Resource Director also leads a research program in cancer genomics
and bioinformatics, mentors students in the Cancer Biology Training Program and collaborates with a number
of BCC investigators to facilitate the development of customized data analysis protocols that meet the evolving
needs of cancer researchers."

10908333,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The development of compensatory behavioral strategies that circumvent impairments to enable life activities is
a predictable response to the onset of functional disability. Increased reliance on the less-affected,
""nonparetic"", hand and arm for the performance of daily activities after stroke is a prominent example due to
the prevalence of stroke and of upper limb hemiparesis as a chronic post-stroke impairment modality. This
compensatory strategy involves major behavioral changes which start early after stroke and have strong
potential to impact post-stroke neural reorganization patterns via mechanisms of experience-dependent
plasticity. The focus of this project across periods has been on understanding neural changes that are driven
by compensatory experiences of the nonparetic forelimb and their impact for functional outcome, as studied in
rodent models of chronic upper extremity impairments resulting from primary motor cortical (M1) infarcts. We
have previously established that learning to rely on the nonparetic forelimb interacts with post-ischemic
regenerative responses in both hemispheres to influence behavioral function bilaterally. Its impact for the
paretic side is to exacerbate disuse and lessen the efficacy of motor rehabilitative training of the paretic limb. In
the most recent project period, we have firmly linked these deleterious effects of learning with the nonparetic
forelimb to its disruption of functionally relevant reorganization of peri-infarct M1 and its promotion of synaptic
changes in the same region. We have also uncovered that learning compensatory ways of using the two limbs
together is beneficial for unimanual function of the paretic side. These and related findings lead us to
hypothesize that unimanual experiences of the nonparetic forelimb promote synaptic changes that compete,
whereas bimanual experiences promote those that cooperate, with patterns of synaptic change mediating
improved paretic forelimb function. We lack detailed knowledge of the time course of the synaptic changes that
are promoted by experiences of either forelimb and clear evidence that they compete, and how they vary with
bimanual experiences is untested. One major goal for this project is to efficiently tackle these knowledge gaps
by capitalizing on in vivo imaging approaches to monitor synaptic structural responses to forelimb experiences
in peri-infarct cortex as they unfold over time. Another is to probe the efficacy of bimanual skill training as a
strategy for competing with and countering deleterious influences of compensating with the nonparetic side.
The specific aims are to test the hypotheses that: (Aim 1) skill learning with the nonparetic forelimb shapes
synaptic connectivity in peri-infarct M1 via the activity of contralesional cortex and transcallosal projections to
diminish its responsiveness to rehabilitative training of the paretic forelimb, (Aim 2) the same pathway
mediates synaptic structural responses in peri-infarct cortex to bimanual skill training that improves paretic
forelimb function and (Aim 3) bimanual skills have the capacity to compete with and overcome maladaptive
behavioral and synaptic connectivity patterns resulting from unimanual experiences of the nonparetic forelimb."
10911048,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a major determinant of mortality and morbidity in hospitalized veterans.
Understanding the pathophysiology of AKI is essential for the development of therapy. This application
proposes to study the role of Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP) in AKI. This protein is expressed exclusively in the
kidney by cells of the thick ascending limbs (TAL) of Henle. In the last funding cycle, we uncovered a key role
of THP in regulating neutrophil infiltration in AKI. The current proposal expands these findings by building on
strong preliminary data showing that THP is important in recovery from AKI by enhancing the healing functions
of renal mononuclear phagocytic cells (MPCs) such as macrophages. These studies will form the basis to
transition into therapeutic applications. Indeed, the PI’s long term goal is to understand how the role of THP
can be modulated to treat veterans who develop AKI.
The central hypothesis is that Tamm-Horsfall Protein is essential to promoting recovery from AKI by enhancing
the abundance and activity of renal MPCs needed for healing. This hypothesis has been formulated on the
basis of strong preliminary and published data. The following specific aims will be used to investigate this
hypothesis.
Aim 1 will define the role of THP on the homeostasis of renal MPCs after AKI
Aim 2 will define the role of THP on the activity of renal MPCs during recovery from AKI
This research will involve the use of THP knockout and wild type mice. A tissue specific knockout mouse will
also be used to study the effect of THP on MPC signaling. The animal model used for AKI is renal ischemia-
reperfusion injury achieved through renal pedicle clamping. Other techniques used in this work include:
Immunofluorescence confocal 3D imaging and tissue cytometry, innovative large scale multiplexed imaging,
flow cytometry, real time-PCR, western blot, protein purification and pharmacological dosing.
This research is innovative, because it will uncover novel regulatory functions for THP that may be relevant not
only in kidney injury but also in other forms of acute or chronic renal disease. Future strategies that enhance
the role of THP in the kidney will be of important therapeutic significance."

Cancer cachexia (CC) is a systemic, metabolic wasting syndrome featuring body weight loss due to skeletal muscle and adipose tissue wasting. CC is suffered by ~80% of cancer patients that causes reduced performance status, intolerance to chemotherapy, and increased mortality. This debilitating condition is poorly understood and has no effective treatment. If CC therapy existed, it would improve treatment responses, increase quality of life, and prolong survival. With 50 years of study, the field has focused on defining pathways that promote atrophy in the end-organs most affected by cachexia. While this work has been fruitful, it has not led to identification of the upstream mediators of CC, nor has it generated effective therapies. There is an urgent need for high-quality discovery science and more detailed clinical phenotyping. We have created a virtual institute comprised of diverse, international, multidisciplinary scientists and clinicians with expertise in cancer, metabolism, neuroendocrine function, immunology, human metabolic diseases, preclinical models, and clinical phenotyping. We hypothesize that CC is driven by tumor-intrinsic factors that activate neurohormonal sickness pathways, which then induce anorexia, metabolic dysfunction, and tissue atrophy.
Methods
Our approach involves sophisticated measures of host-tumor interactions including innovative investigation of (1) systemic metabolic flux in mice using isotope tracing, imaging mass spectroscopy, dynamic nuclear imaging, and dietary and pharmacologic interventions; (2) cellular components and secreted factors from the tumor microenvironment using imaging mass cytometry, patient-derived organoid xenografts, microbial toxins, and CRISPR-based manipulations; (3) central pathways regulating appetite, behavior, and peripheral organ metabolism using human metabolic phenotyping, optogenetic, and pharmacological methods. We will perform the largest, most comprehensive observational study in CC subjects to thoroughly define CC subtypes and their clinical biomarkers using epidemiologic tools, novel image segmentation algorithms, and cluster analyses.
Project Goals
Our vision is to develop mechanistically informed treatments for cancer cachexia (CC) to improve quality of life and life expectancy for patients. Working as a multidisciplinary team with expertise in basic science, clinical research, and epidemiology, we will establish a therapeutically relevant classification of molecular and clinical subtypes of CC. We will build therapies to normalize metabolism and neuroendocrine dysregulation in CC to enable successful anti-cancer treatment and systemic recovery for patients. In 5 years, we will have laid the foundation for a new generation of CC treatment trials and strategies that will, for the first time, deliver practice-changing evidence for improved outcomes for patients with cancer who are at risk of or suffer from CC."

Human genes are arranged on 23 pairs of chromosomes, but in cancer, tumour-promoting genes can free themselves from chromosomes and relocate to circular, extrachromosomal pieces of DNA (ecDNA). These ecDNA do not follow the normal “rules” of chromosomal inheritance, enabling tumours to achieve far higher levels of cancer-causing oncogenes than would otherwise be possible, and licensing cancers with a way to evolve and change their genomes to evade treatments at rates that would be unthinkable for human cells. The altered circular architecture of ecDNAs also changes the way that the cancer-causing genes are regulated and expressed, further contributing to aggressive tumour growth. These unique features make ecDNA-containing cancers especially aggressive and difficult to treat. Cancer patients whose tumours harbour ecDNA have markedly shorter survival. Despite being first seen over fifty years ago, the critical importance of ecDNA has only recently come to light, and the scale of the problem is substantial. ecDNAs are present in nearly half of all human cancer types and potentially up-to a third of all cancer patients. The collective current understanding of how ecDNA form, how they function, how they move around the cell, how they evolve to resist treatment, how they impact the immune system, and how they can be effectively targeted are lacking. We bring together an internationally recognized, pioneering interdisciplinary team of cancer biologists, geneticists, computer scientists, evolutionary biologists, mathematicians, clinicians, and patient advocates to boldly create novel insights and resources and to provide transformative solutions to one of Cancer’s Grand Challenges.

11124990,"Next Generation T cell therapies for childhood cancers [NexTGen] 
Current treatments fail to cure many children with solid cancers. Recent advances in adult cancers such as checkpoint blockade and targeted small molecules have made little impact in childhood disease. Engineered T-cell therapies can achieve durable responses in refractory lymphoid cancers without long-term toxicity. These are precisely the characteristics required for new treatments for pediatric solid cancers. In contrast to hematologic malignancies, solid cancers are challenging due to a lack of targets, tumor heterogeneity, and hostile tumor microenvironment (TME). We posit that through advanced cellular engineering we can overcome these challenges. Our vision is that engineered T-cell therapy for childhood solid cancers will become routine within a decade. Our central hypothesis is that coupling of advanced cellular engineering along with progressive clinical development is the fastest route to developing effective T-cell therapies for pediatric solid tumors. In NexTGen, we combine detailed studies of primary tumors to discover new targets and understand how the TME subverts T- cell function. This, along with a closely coupled clinical development program will guide the progressive engineering of T-cells to result in transformative therapies. NexTGen is composed of 6 inter-connected work-packages (WPs) with work initially focused on pediatric sarcomas and brain tumors. AIMS: WP1: To identify suitable targets for engineered T-cells. WP2: To understand the TME in pediatric solid cancers. WP3: To develop receptors and other engineering components which target tumor cells and resist or modulate the TME. WP4: To evaluate the function of engineered T-cells developed in WP3. WP5: To translate approaches from WP4 and test them in clinical studies designed for maximal impact. Cancer Grand Challenges - Full Application - 2021 WP6: To promote data sharing across all WPs. METHODS: Target discovery (WP1) and TME studies (WP2) will utilize mass spectroscopy and chip cytometry respectively. Component engineering (WP3) will use protein engineering methods. To model engineered cell function, WP4 will mostly use intact tumor models such as immune PDXs. In WP5, clinical product generation will involve autologous closed system semi-automated manufacturing. WP6 uses standard and custom databases and data sharing platforms. USE OF RESULTS: Tumor target and TME data from WP1 and 2 will be uploaded to databases developed by WP6 for widespread distribution. Engineering components from WP3 and functional data from WP4 will be available for incorporation into therapeutic T-cell strategies by the entire community. Clinical study data from WP5 should lead to registration studies, improving cure rates and mitigation of long-term toxicity to realize our Vision."

11124987,"The cancer research community is on the verge of a major leap in our understanding of the factors that contribute to human cancer risk. While it is clear that mutations in DNA, either spontaneous or environmentally induced, are essential for cancer development, recent advances have highlighted the importance of non-mutagenic factors as rate-limiting determinants of cancer risk in human populations and in mouse cancer models. 
The root causes of human cancer have been widely debated, but most of the emphasis has been on the origins of the “driver” mutations that are ubiquitous in human tumours. Although epidemiology studies have highlighted the possible roles of lifestyle factors such as obesity, alcohol consumption, inflammation and poor diet in cancer risk, it has generally been assumed that these factors act directly or indirectly to cause mutations in DNA, thus contributing to tumour mutational burden and resulting in increased cancer risk. In contrast, recent sequencing studies have uncovered abundant mutations in normal human tissues, suggesting that even strong cancer driver mutations are not sufficient for cancer formation. These results were presaged by studies of mouse tumour models, some carried out more than 50 years ago, showing that promotion is the rate-limiting step in tumour development.
To identify the mechanisms that control mutated normal cells, and to elucidate the precise mechanisms by which promoting factors stimulate the conversion of these cells to neoplastic growth, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team of investigators with wide-ranging experience in epidemiology, genetics, computational network analysis and machine learning, tissue imaging of gene expression, single cell transcriptomics, and genome-wide CRISPR functional screens. We will focus human analysis on a unique collection of several thousand human normal and matched tumour samples from >20 countries, including regions of both high and low cancer risk. Detailed risk factor information and whole genome sequence data is available from all these samples as part of the Grand Challenge Mutographs study. Analysis of these samples, together with detailed intervention studies in human populations, mouse models and human organoids, will allow us to develop a roadmap of tumour promotion from single normal cells carrying driver mutations, through to malignant progression. Our findings will facilitate identification of the causative environmental factors that promote cancer and provide routes to new methods and approaches to cancer prevention based on a deeper understanding of the process of initiated cell selection by tumour promoting agents."
10843281,"Project Summary
 Cognitive decline is pervasive with advancing age, with an estimated 50 million people presently living with
dementia worldwide. While this cognitive deterioration is widespread, the mechanisms underlying dementia, its
underlying neuropathology, and why some individuals are vulnerable while others are resilient are poorly
understood. With advancing age, disruptions to circadian rhythms are virtually universal and precede age-related
dementia by as much as 15 years. Likewise, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is regulated by circadian rhythms and
sleep, with disruptions to circadian timing/sleep leading to BBB dysfunction. Because deficits in BBB permeability
are linked to age-related cognitive deterioration, our proposal explores the possibility that age-related deficits in
circadian rhythms and resulting disturbances to sleep lead to BBB degradation and cognitive decline, and that
resilience to circadian degradation is neuroprotective. We will also apply a novel, non-invasive technology
developed by our group to rescue degraded circadian rhythms, BBB integrity, and cognition in aged vulnerable
animals that has broad translational applicability if successful. This technology is based on recent findings that
flickering gamma (40 Hz) lighting rescues circadian rhythms, cognitive function, and neuropathology in mouse
models of Alzheimer’s disease. Because flickering light of this frequency can cause discomfort, migraines, and
fatigue, we developed lighting using ‘masked’ 40-Hz spectral flicker (i.e., Invisible Spectral Flicker (ISF)) by
applying an antiphase color mixing approach that raises the critical frequency at which flicker is perceived. Our
pilot data reveal that this lighting generates 40 Hz oscillations in the brain comparable to 40 Hz flicker and
rescues circadian rhythms in behavior in aged animals. 40 Hz lighting treatment has not been applied to age-
associated cognitive decline of non-Alzheimer’s origin or BBB integrity with aging. The present proposal asks
two main questions: 1) Is vulnerability to circadian degradation with advancing age associated with cognitive
decline through deterioration of the BBB and resulting neuroinflammation, with mice resilient to age-related
circadian degradation resistant to BBBd and cognitive decline, and 2) Can non-invasive 40 Hz ISF lighting
treatment rescue circadian degradation and age-associated degradation of the BBB and cognitive functioning in
vulnerable mice? Together, these findings will enhance our understanding of the mechanisms and underlying
neuropathology of age-related cognitive decline, but also have the potential for wide-ranging treatment."
10915018,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Rising childhood obesity rates are coupled with an alarming increase in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in
children and adolescents. Evidence suggests that in utero exposures to maternal obesity and/or gestational
diabetes mellitus (GDM) contribute to these upward trends, and the effects of these prenatal exposures on
metabolic risk become more pronounced during adolescence. While the biological mechanisms of such
maternal-fetal programming are poorly understood, compelling studies in rodent models show that in utero
exposure to maternal obesity and/or diabetes causes abnormal development of brain pathways involved in
energy balance regulation, leading to obesity and type 2 diabetes later in life.
Our group was the first to study the effects in utero exposures to maternal obesity and GDM on brain pathways
and metabolic outcomes in humans using a pioneering approach combining neuroimaging methods and
metabolic phenotyping in children. To date, findings from cross-sectional studies in our BrainChild cohort
provide strong support for the neuroendocrine programming effects seen in animal models. The earliest
abnormality we have identified involves modification of brain pathways known to be involved in energy balance
regulation. These brain modifications were predictive of increases in food intake and weight gain in children
during short term follow-up and lead to the primary hypothesis of the present study: that differences in the
neural markers observed in children at age 7-10 will be predictive of metabolic outcomes during the transition
to adolescence, a critical time for brain development and metabolic decline. Child postnatal behaviors including
physical activity, diet and sleep may also be mediating or modifying the effects of brain pathways linking in
utero exposures to maternal GDM and obesity on child metabolic trajectories. We will include measures of
these behaviors and explore these pathways to generate important data for future studies focusing on lifestyle
behaviors.
The proposed longitudinal study of the BrainChild cohort for up to six years of follow up provides the unique
opportunity to advance our understanding of the interplay among brain changes, obesity, insulin resistance and
beta cell function at early stages in the evolution of transgenerational transmission of obesity and diabetes
risks. Given the growing number of pregnancies complicated by maternal obesity and GDM, the well-being of
future generations may depend to an important degree on developing interventions that can break the vicious

knowledge base required for development of such interventions."
10907568,"Project Summary/Abstract: The U.S. has more health science STEM jobs available than qualified workers
to fill them and lags other OECD nations in math and science, with major achievement gaps and STEM
workforce under-representation among women and students of color. Improved STEM education is needed
in high school and early collegiate settings that engages, prepares, and inspires all students—and especially
under-represented groups. 21st-century STEM jobs require not only STEM content knowledge but also
problem-solving, critical thinking, and teamwork. Research has shown that team collaboration and application
of STEM to problems in communities are effective at improving STEM outcomes in under-represented groups.
Downstream, the follow-on effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have exacerbated STEM degree program
recruitment and retention issues (especially among under-represented groups). Parametric Studio Inc. (PSI)
believes collaborative game-based project learning experiences have the potential to address STEM
deficiencies and under-representation while better preparing the future health science STEM workforce.
However, innovations to project-based learning to add better connections to industry tools, improve
engagement, ease implementation issues, reduce cost, and enhance authenticity or realism are needed.
 The overall goal of this multi-phase SBIR project is to develop, validate, and commercialize MiMICRE, a
game-based STEM project learning platform that can address current deficiencies in project-based learning
(PBL). MiMICRE utilizes applied math and science in the design, analysis, and simulation of bioscience,
engineering, and biomimicry-focused STEM projects. In MiMICRE, users collaboratively design product
solutions, apply math and science models to evaluate them, and then 3D-print and test results in the real
world. Ultimately, MiMICRE will be sold to high school, post-secondary, and informal Ed. markets.
 This Phase II SBIR project is based on Phase I proof-of-concept success that demonstrated the
functionality of key MiMICRE components and showed that platform elements are usable by students and
teachers. Deployment in the classroom was validated: Phase I prototype testing produced several early
indicators of improved student engagement, efficacy, and STEM content knowledge. Phase II work will thus
focus on the following Aims: 1) develop Phase II enhancements to the MiMICRE Phase I prototype that
will promote widespread adoption in high school and early collegiate settings; 2) show that third-party
MiMICRE projects can be quickly defined for customers; and 3) conduct larger pilots to evaluate
improvements in STEM knowledge, STEM interest and efficacy, and perceived connection of skills and
knowledge to future STEM employment. Phase II will result in a completed, tested solution for improved
STEM project-based learning in high schools and colleges. Phase II success is critical in terms of product
validation, attracting follow-on private-sector investors/partners, and ultimate product commercialization."
10932139,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The primary cilium is a cell surface organelle that plays critical roles in human health. Multiple G protein-coupled
receptors (GPCRs) are trafficked to the primary cilium where they carry extracellular signals across the
membrane to initiate intracellular signaling events. Genetic studies have linked GPCR signaling at primary cilia
to human metabolic disease. For example, ciliary GPCRs regulate diverse metabolic processes such as the
perception of satiety, the secretion of insulin, and the formation of adipocytes. With 42% of U.S. adults classified
as obese, understanding how the primary cilium functions as a GPCR signaling center is critical to addressing
this major human health concern. In this proposal I will test how the primary cilium membrane composition
controls GPCR signaling. Lipids have profound effects on GPCR signaling through (1) direct binding and (2)
indirect modulation by changing membrane bilayer properties. Through these interactions, GPCRs play
fundamental roles in cellular lipid signaling and organismal lipid homeostasis. A key barrier to understanding
how GPCRs regulate human metabolism is the lack of tools to study lipids in cells. I have developed a unique
skillset and a set of tools to visualize, quantify and manipulate lipids at primary cilia to address these challenges.
 This proposal tests three fundamental questions related to cilia lipid signaling. First, despite its
importance in regulating metabolism, it is unknown whether the primary cilia membrane is altered by dietary
lipids. External stimuli robustly change the plasma membrane (PM) composition to drive cell signaling events
required for cellular homeostasis. To test this at cilia, I will treat cells with fatty acids or cholesterol to mimic the
human diet and ask whether the membrane composition is altered. Cilia lipids will be further examined in mice
fed different chow diets and in mice with metabolic disease (Aim 1). Second, despite having a membrane that is
structurally continuous with the PM, the primary cilium maintains a distinct membrane composition that is critical
for GPCR signaling through unknown mechanisms. I will test whether lipids exchange between the PM and cilia
membrane, and then determine how lipids are delivered to cilia by disrupting membrane trafficking pathways
(Aim 2). Finally, I will determine what lipids are required for FFAR4 activity at cilia. FFAR4 is a GPCR that
intimately relies on the integrity of the cilia membrane environment for signaling. By cross comparing this screen
with a screen I previously performed to find regulators of the ciliary GPCR SMO, I will identify generalizable
pathways controlling ciliary lipid homeostasis. Importantly, this screen will also determine the specific lipid
requirements of FFAR4, which is a promising target for treating metabolic disease due to its role in insulin
secretion and adipogenesis. Through this research I will develop robust methodologies that can be utilized to
study cilia in diverse contexts, and I will advance our understanding of cilia biology, membrane biology, and
GPCR signaling. The long-term vision of this project is to identify new strategies for correcting lipid or GPCR
signaling defects found in human metabolic disease."
10773202,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Long‐acting injectables for antiretroviral therapy (ART) or pre‐exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) are the most
exciting recent advance in HIV medicine. The roll‐out of cabotegravir long‐acting (CAB LA) PrEP will be
expanded massively globally with the WHO advising this PrEP option in late July 2022. For any new PrEP
tool, determining the best way to avert failures is key, especially with CAB LA PrEP which can fail with
integrase inhibitor mutations, with implications for future management. The trials demonstrating that CAB LA
was superior to oral PrEP across populations employed single plasma levels of CAB as exposure metrics to
adjudicate failures. However, half of the breakthroughs in the trials were not explained by plasma CAB levels,
especially with on‐time injections, likely because of limitations of plasma levels. Drugs delivered via injection
elute from depot compartments at variable rates over time, making long‐term metrics of exposure important.
 Our UCSF group has been working on long‐acting exposure metrics of antiretrovirals (ARVs) in hair
samples (which are easy to collect, store and ship) during the first iteration and first renewal of this R01 grant.
We have been highly productive over this R01 to date (publishing 72 papers), demonstrating important uses of
hair levels in the fields of HIV treatment, prevention, over the perinatal period, and in low‐income countries.
As PrEP is revolutionized with the availability (e.g. CAB) and promise (e.g. lenacapavir) of LA agents, drug
levels will play a critical role in determining the onset of protection, adjudicating failures, and assessing risks
with discontinuation; this renewal seeks to contribute to this important field. As an exploratory objective, we
will also develop an antibody to CAB to create a point‐of‐care urine assay, as we have with tenofovir.
 This proposal will leverage three important trials to explore key knowledge gaps that will arise in the
next phase of LA PrEP. The Sustainable East Africa Research in Community Health (SEARCH) Sapphire trial is
evaluating a number of interventions to prevent and treat HIV, including the provision of CAB LA to 600 at‐
risk individuals across 10 communities in East Africa (Aim 1). The Botswana Harvard AIDS Institute
Partnership will launch a new study to provide women in the immediate postpartum period CAB LA PrEP
and follow mothers and their infants for 96 weeks, evaluating incident HIV and resistance, as well as the
pharmacokinetics (PK) of CAB and its transfer during breastfeeding (Aim 2). The PURPOSE 1 and 2 trials
(Gilead) will study lenacapavir LA (a new capsid inhibitor given every 6 months as a subcutaneous injection)
for PrEP in diverse populations and will incorporate hair collection in their open‐label extension phases. All 3
trials will collect hair and plasma for drug levels, and track robust outcomes, to allow us to 1) investigate hair
levels as predictors of failure; 2) determine maternal to infant transfer of CAB; and 3) assess contributors to PK
variability to LA PrEP in diverse populations. The overarching goal of this renewal is to develop highly
predictive biologic PK measures to optimize LA PrEP and to inform public health interventions in prevention."

The Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) is
seeking proposals for collaborative research and convening activities advance regulatory science, policy, and
procedures to address a range of critical public health topics, including drug development, drug approval,
bioresearch monitoring, human subject protection, and post market surveillance. Building on over ten years of
collaborative experience working with the FDA on such topics, the Duke-Robert J. Margolis, MD, Center for
Health Policy (Duke-Margolis) proposes to continue collaborating with CDER to tackle a range of priority public
health issues. Through this new cooperative agreement Duke-Margolis proposes to expand on our existing
collaboration with FDA by partnering with CDER and experts within the Duke ecosystem to advance the following
aims:
Specific Aim 1: Implement a multidisciplinary and collaborative research and convening capacity to support FDA
and its stakeholders to explore and address a range of critical public health topics related to FDA’s oversight of
medical products, policy, and surveillance methods and systems. Our approach will incorporate a wide array of
stakeholder perspectives, facilitate the identification of practical and actionable solutions, and support the public
health mission of FDA.
Specific Aim 2: Synthesize and distill the core research, stakeholder input, and workshop or meeting discussions
pursued in Aim 1 to establish concrete, actionable next steps and recommendations for all stakeholder groups,
not just FDA, to pursue.
Specific Aim 3: Disseminate the findings and recommendations developed under Aim 2 to the public in a
transparent and timely method, with an eye toward continually engaging stakeholders to further refine and
implement key concepts and recommendations where feasible and appropriate."
10913386,"ABSTRACT
Circadian rhythms in physiology are essential for human health, and in mammals, these
rhythms are coordinated by a central circadian clock located in the suprachiasmatic
nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. The SCN produces the neural code for circadian
time through time-of-day dependent modulation of the activity of various ion channels that
control action potential firing. The goal of this research is to understand the ion channel
properties, interactions, and functional consequences that set these circadian changes in
action potential activity in the SCN, focusing on two types of channels that functionally
interact during the action potential: BK K+ channels and their Ca2+ channel activators.
During the day in SCN, BK channels are activated predominantly by L-type Ca2+ channels
(LTCCs), while at night activation depends on Ryanodine Receptors (RyRs). How this
switch between the two Ca2+ channel subtypes occurs is not yet known but has important
implications during the action potential for any cell where BK channels utilize multiple
Ca2+ sources. The proposed studies test the hypothesis that modulation of BK activity via
specific Ca2+ channel coupling alters the contribution of BK channels to the action
potential. The circadian consequences of this altering this functional coupling will then
be probed with Ca2+ channel mutations, as well as BK channel mutations associated with
the neurological disorder KCNMA1-linked channelopathy. Our specific aims are to: (1)
Determine the key subunits and the physical and functional interactions between BK and
Ca2+ channels that regulate firing in day and night in SCN using biochemistry and
electrophysiology. The consequences of disrupting these interactions on circadian
rhythm will be assessed in the SCN circuit and circadian behavioral outputs, and (2)
Determine how pathogenic KCNMA1 patient mutations that alter BK channel activity
affect BK current, action potential firing, and the circadian aspects of sleep and seizure
as a result of their interactions with the respective LTCC and RyR Ca2+ channels. Using
the SCN as a model, the outcome of the proposed studies will reveal how specific ion
channel partnerships work together during the action potential to control firing, and how
and how dysregulation of their properties and interactions contribute to circadian, sleep,
and seizure disorder."
10884376,"This proposal is prompted by our observation that the down-regulation of thioredoxin (Trx) in both the
cytosol and mitochondria (Trx1KO x Trx2KO) in mice resulted in reduced spontaneous tumor formation during
aging and a slight extension of lifespan. Since our previous studies with Trx1KO or Trx2KO mice showed that
the down-regulation of Trx1 or Trx2 alone enhanced oxidative stress compared to wild-type (WT) littermates,
the beneficial effects of the down-regulation of Trx in both the cytosol and mitochondria on age-related
spontaneous tumor formation were unanticipated. To further support our observation in Trx1KO x Trx2KO mice,
our recent report demonstrated that the combined overexpression of Trx in both the cytosol and mitochondria
(Trx1Tg x Trx2Tg) in male C57BL/6 mice had significantly enhanced cancer development, increased other
diseases, and had a significantly shorter (16.3%) lifespan compared to their WT littermates. Therefore, our
studies with Trx1KO x Trx2KO and Trx1Tg x Trx2Tg mice convincingly demonstrated that the down-regulation
of Trx in both the cytosol and mitochondria attenuates spontaneous cancer development during aging through
mechanisms specific to Trx function.
 Trx is a molecule that plays: a) an essential role in maintaining a reduced cellular environment; and b)
critical roles for the normal function of proteins that contain cysteine residues. These physiological roles of Trx
are unique and extremely important compared to other antioxidant enzymes because changes in the
redox-sensitive signaling pathways have more diverse effects on aging than the accumulation of oxidative
damage. Consistent with this notion, the reduced tumor development in Trx1KO x Trx2KO mice was associated
with several signaling/molecular changes: a) enhanced apoptosis pathways; b) enhanced autophagy; and c)
less oxidative damage to lipids compared to WT mice. These observations indicate that the down-regulation of
Trx in both the cytosol and mitochondria results in suppressed tumor development by: a) enhanced removal of
damaged cells by apoptosis; and b) enhanced removal of cellular damage by autophagy. The goal of this
application is to pursue these novel findings and determine the specific mechanisms by which reduced Trx in
both the cytosol and mitochondria attenuates cancer development during aging. We will test the following
hypothesis: Trx down-regulation in both the cytosol and mitochondria enhances apoptosis and
autophagy, resulting in the removal of damaged cells that have damage to DNA, proteins, and lipids,
which leads to reduced genomic instability and suppressed tumor development.
 This research will: a) significantly expand our understanding about the roles that redox-sensitive
signaling pathways play in age-related cancer development; b) provide important clues for age-related cancer
prevention and therapy using pharmacological interventions (e.g., thioredoxin inhibition); and c) have an impact
on improving the health of the elderly (specifically against cancer) resulting in an extension of their healthspan."
10917146,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Approximately 20% of adolescents in the US have obesity, which is significant because of its many health
consequences, including cardiometabolic disease leading to premature death. Treatment of obesity is
particularly important for adolescents because obesity in this age group also increases the risk for lower
income and lower educational attainment in adulthood. The cornerstone of all forms of obesity treatment is
behavioral modification strategies that support daily dietary and physical activity change. Self-monitoring is a
powerful behavioral tool that is grounded in Social Cognitive Theory. This theory states that greater self-
awareness through proximate self-measurement improves self-efficacy, self-control, and self-reinforcement.
Self-monitoring of weight through daily self-weighing (SW) at home has been found to be effective and safe for
weight loss and maintenance in adults, particularly when there is external accountability for the home weights.
Daily SW at home with accountability to clinic represents a scalable intervention that can be feasibly
implemented into the clinical care for adolescents with obesity. However, daily SW at home has not been
prospectively assessed in adolescent patients with obesity who are seeking obesity treatment. The objective of
this proposal is to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, safety, and estimate the effect on weight of daily SW at
home, integrated with the electronic health record (EHR) and clinical care of adolescents with obesity. I will: 1)
Use mixed methods to determine adolescent and parent perspectives on daily weighing on smart scales
connected to the EHR as a tool for adolescents with obesity who are seeking weight loss treatment; 2)
Determine clinician and clinic staff perspectives on daily weighing on connected to the EHR; and 3)
Conduct a randomized, clinic-based pilot study to compare the feasibility, acceptability, safety, and estimate
the effect size of three conditions in a weight management clinic for adolescents with obesity: a) usual care, b)
usual care + daily SW at home on a simple scale, and c) usual care + daily SW at home on a smart scale that
is connected to clinic (with individualized feedback to the patient). I will prospectively and serially assess mood,
body image, stress, weight management practices, and disordered eating behaviors. This project will generate
critical preliminary data to inform the design of a larger study (R01) that fully evaluates safety and efficacy of
daily SW at home, with and without regular external accountability from clinic, in adolescents with obesity.
Completing this K23 training program will allow me to establish skills in mixed methods, epidemiologic methods
and intervention design, and foundational skills in implementation of digital technology, as well as lay the
groundwork for leading novel and high-impact obesity studies. The multidisciplinary mentorship during this
career development award will prepare me to become an independent, extramurally-funded clinician scientist
who investigates clinic-based interventions for obesity treatment."

 We present herein a grant application focused on the late-stage development of
preclinical candidate JSF-3285. Per our recently published research, we have disclosed
the genesis of this program that led to the hit compound DG167 and identification of the
essential β-keto acyl synthase KasA as its target. Building on this effort, our preliminary
data detail the optimization to arrive at JSF-3285 which is efficacious in the acute and
chronic models of M. tuberculosis infection in mice at doses as low as 5 mg/kg once-daily
oral. This proposal seeks to build on this data by conducting the requisite drug
combination and relapse studies to achieve clinical status and begin IND-enabling
studies. In addition, we propose a second generation program based on preliminary data
consisting of a structurally distinct amide series with promising in vitro efficacy, mouse
PK, and X-ray structural data. The grant's second aim will evolve this series, leveraging
our extensive X-ray structural data, SAR, and machine learning models, to produce at
minimum novel early lead compounds if not compounds equal to or surpassing JSF-3285.
The sum total of the two aims, featuring JSF-3285 and second generation candidate/s,
will lend a high probability to a KasA inhibitor becoming clinically relevant in the next 5
years."
10848249,"PROJECT SUMMARY
With rapid improvements to the quality of our healthcare, there is an urgency to better our understanding of age-
related diseases like Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Clear connections between AD progression and glucose-
dependent bioenergetic deficits in the brain have motivated studies to uncover key biomarkers in AD diagnosis;
apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) has proven to be a hallmark indicator for patients at risk of developing AD. Astrocytes
are the primary manufacturer of ApoE4 in the brain, motivating most AD-relevant studies to focus on defining
the relationship between glial cells and ApoE4. Despite evidence connecting neuronal metabolic dysfunction to
the expression of ApoE4, the underlying biology of the metabolic changes is not understood. Our primary interest
with this project is to define the mechanisms through which ApoE4 expression and reduced neuronal glucose
metabolism are connected. We hypothesize that correcting disrupted mechanisms in ApoE4-expressing neurons
will result in a recovery of metabolic phenotypes to more closely resemble neurons expressing ApoE3. To test
our hypothesis, we have developed a paradigm that combines the targeted metabolomic analysis of human
induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived neurons in vitro with the spatial transcriptomic analysis of mice in
vivo. The in vivo model will be C57BL/6 mice with a whole-body knock in of human ApoE3 or ApoE4 on an
amyloid precursor protein (APP) background with the Swedish, Iberian, and Arctic mutations (APPNL-G-F). We will
perform spatial transcriptomics on the hippocampus, one of the first regions affected by AD progression, to
longitudinally track the most differentially expressed genes due to ApoE4. The human iPSCs expressing either
the E3 or E4 isoform of ApoE allows for a nearly pure (>99%) neuronal culture. The whole neuronal metabolome
is probed with uniformly 13C labeled glucose ([U-13C] glucose) to quantify which metabolites in neurons are
being derived from glucose. The metabolome of the ApoE3 and ApoE4 expressing neurons will be compared to
define the primary differences in how glucose is metabolized between neurons based on their ApoE isoform. We
will use CRISPR inhibition or activation (CRISPRi/a) to alter the expression of our genes of interest in a targeted
metabolomics study to evaluate the functionality of each gene in relation to glucose metabolism in neurons. We
will then evaluate whether metabolic recovery is achieved through comparing ApoE4 neurons to ApoE3 neurons
based on equivalence of glucose-derived metabolites, cytosolic ATP and glucose levels, and cell survival.
Successful completion of these aims will inform future studies focusing on metabolic recovery in neurons as well
as providing candidates for therapeutic targets against neurodegenerative disease. The research will be
conducted at Gladstone Institutes and UCSF under the mentorship of Dr. Ken Nakamura along with key facilities
such as the Stem Cell, Genomics, and Bioinformatics Cores to complete the proposed work. The training plan
spans a 3-year period focused primarily on research with 1.5 years spent per aim. The plan also sets aside time
essential for nurturing academic science through conferences, mentoring, and university/community programs."
10898605,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect, yet the genetics of this disease are poorly
understood. The genomic mechanisms of this disease include distinct rare copy number variants (CNVs) and protein-
coding single nucleotide variants (SNVs). CHDs without other congenital anomalies, or isolated CHD, comprise 75%
of all CHDs. Genome sequencing (GS) studies of isolated CHD have focused primarily on protein-coding regions,
identifying disease-causal variants in only ~10-20% of subjects. This substantial knowledge gap suggests that other
etiologies, such as variation in the non-coding genome, may play a role. The non-coding genome is vast, constituting
98% of the genome, and encompasses multiple feature types, including the non-coding RNAs. There is growing
evidence for the role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in disease, including developmental disorders of the heart.
As such, the long-term goal of this study is to elucidate lncRNA’s role in contributing to cardiac malformations. The
overarching objective of the proposed investigation is to develop computational methods to predict the function of
lncRNAs involved in heart development and predict the pathogenic impact of variants impacting these molecules
leading to heart maldevelopment. We will use GS data from the Gabriella Miller Kids First (GMKF) cohort to associate
variation in lncRNAs to CHD. We will then use single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq) data to identify lncRNAs
expressed in relevant cell types during crucial stages of human cardiogenesis. Our central hypothesis is that variants
in lncRNAs are a probable cause in unsolved CHD cases and that by using scRNA-seq data, we can prioritize
candidates for future functional validation. We propose the following specific aims to address this challenge. In Aim
1, we will develop a machine learning (ML) tool to annotate lncRNA variants in our CHD cohort. There is a lack of
tools to interpret the biological implications of CNVs and SNVs impacting lncRNAs. Our preliminary data effectively
annotated clinically validated CNVs associated with isolated CHD by applying ML. We will extend our methods to
consider CNVs and SNVs impacting lncRNAs and those impacting protein-coding genes. Aim 2 will apply network
analysis on scRNA-Seq data to elucidate lncRNA’s role in heart development. We will associate lncRNA-protein causal
relationships with general heart development by using inference from the gene regulatory networks (GRN). GRN
will be built from single-cell transcriptomics data to contribute to the discovery of lncRNAs involved in heart
development. This work is innovative as we will be the first to construct an ML tool for cardiac-specific lncRNA
variant annotation and clarify the role that lncRNAs may play in the development of CHD. Completing this project
will achieve the NHLBI’s mission of creating computational techniques for understanding the mechanisms
underlying the regulation of normal heart formation and NICHD’s objective of comprehending the genetic basis of
heart defects. In addition, the research is significant since it may lead to the discovery of novel genetic etiologies in
CHD and the identification of novel therapeutic targets."
10873075,"Project Summary/Abstract
Hispanic Latinos (HLs) have the highest risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias, the
highest proportion of any ethnic group in the US. In genome-wide association studies (GWAS) conducted mostly
in non-Hispanic white (NHW) individuals, Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) was established as the leading AD genetic
risk factor, increasing risk 3-12 fold compared to the non-risk allele, APOE3. In HLs however, there is discordant
evidence about the association of APOE4 with AD which is at least partially attributed to the genetic diversity of
HLs stemming from widespread geographic origins. GWAS in large HL populations identified ancestry native to
Central America, the primary ancestry of Hispanic Mexican Americans (HMA), have little to no AD association
with APOE4. Studies further suggest that inheritance of APOE4 allele from native ancestor may not increase AD
risk to the same extent as that observed in NHW. It is postulated that genetic variation, possibly regulatory, either
local to APOE allele, or across the genome, modifies APOE4 biology. Recently, genetic variation local to APOE
was shown to dominantly influence gene transcription and APOE expression independent of APOE genotype.
Gaining insight on the molecular basis by which HMA background modifies APOE4 biology would identify
protective mechanisms against AD. My central hypothesis is that APOE4 will be associated with AD-related
phenotypes in cortical organoids with NHW ancestry, but not with HMA ancestry, or to a lesser extent. Since AD
develops decades before cognitive decline and ethnic variation is human-specific, I will test my hypothesis in 3D
cortical organoids. I will generate excitatory neuron-enriched human cortical organoids (hCO), and inhibitory
neuron-enriched human subpallial organoids (hSO) to explore neuron subtype-specific differences in AD-related
phenotypes. To investigate cellular phenotypes mediated by APOE4 with respect to genetic background, I will
1) characterize the effect of APOE4 on AD-related cellular phenotypes within NHW background, and 2)
determine the effect of HMA background on APOE4 mediated phenotypes and gene transcription. My preliminary
data suggests that the APOE4 allele reduces growth and upregulates APOE expression in both hCO and hSO
compared to organoids carrying the non-risk allele, APOE3. Aim 1 will explore the cellular basis contributing to
size (differentiation, maturation, and cell death) and characterize AD-related pathology by immunostaining and
protein expression assays. To control for patient background and assess the specific effects of APOE4 genotype
and genetic background, I will gene-edit APOE3 to APOE4 in iPSCs with NHW and HMA backgrounds. In Aim
2, I will determine the phenotypic and transcriptional changes associated with HMA background on APOE4-
mediated AD-related phenotypes. Under this fellowship, I will expand my molecular toolkit and in vitro disease
modeling and hone my skills as a molecular neuroscientist. I will also strengthen my analytical skills and learn
new methods to probe gene expression by training under my sponsor and a supporting group of scientists."

 In the United States, 30.3 million people (9.4% of the US population) have diabetes; underrepresented
minorities, such as American Indian and Alaskan Natives (AI/AN), have a disproportionally high prevalence of
diabetes (15.1% for AI/AN compared to 7.4% for non-Hispanic and whites). Eliminating health disparities such
as diabetes and obesity among AI/AN requires the identification, recruitment, education, and training of a
diverse group of talented scientists in the US. At the University of Utah, we have established a Native
American Research Internship in diabetes, obesity and metabolism related research the NARI-NIDDK
program. NARI-NIDDK was built on the principles of community engagement with Native elders, faculty, and
student guidance with the goal of increasing AI/AN representation in the biomedical sciences, specifically
diabetes-related research, and thus reducing health disparities that exist for AI/AN. NARI-NIDDK
undergraduate participants receive research, cultural, and professional mentorship and training with committed
community members and renowned scientists. To date, 21 participants representing 11 tribal nations, 14
colleges/universities, and 9 home states, have participated in the NARI-NIDDK program. All have successfully
completed the program requirements with 1 participating for 2 summers. Of the 21 NARI-NIDDK Program
participants, 6 (29%) are current undergraduate students and 15 (71%) have completed a bachelor’s
degree. Among those who have completed their bachelor’s degree, 14 (93%) have completed a BS degree
and 1 (7%) have completed a BA degree. No one has dropped out of college. To date, 7 (33%) participants
have worked in biomedical science fields as research assistants. Of the 15 NARI-NIDDK participants who
have completed their undergraduate degree, 9 (60%) participants are continuing their education in the
health/science fields: 5 were accepted into a graduate program; 4 were accepted into medical school.
We hope to continue the current NARI-NIDDK research experiences for NARI trainees in the field of diabetes
or obesity-related research. Our current NARI participants continue to report that diabetes and obesity were
the top health concerns of their families and the majority of participants have family members affected by
diabetes and obesity. Through this proposal, we will continue the existing NARI-NIDDK program to include
research experiences and educational and clinical outreach experiences in diabetes and obesity research
(NARI-NIDDK), two major health concerns that plague AI/AN populations."
10912484,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has demonstrated the deadly threat of pulmonary pathogens in
an exposure-naïve world with no existing vaccines or therapeutics at the ready. The development of effective
vaccines has provided key prophylactic products, but therapeutics remain important due to slow and incomplete
world coverage, along with emergence of resistance variants. There is especially a need for polytherapy
platforms that can be deployed in formats amenable to global settings, and need for platforms that can be rapidly
developed against future pulmonary threats. This project aims to develop a versatile inhalable therapeutic
platform against COVID-19 disease and future coronaviruses. It is designed for nebulizer and distributable
inhalation devices to maximize drug activity in the lung. The polymeric prodrug platform has recently shown
strong potentiating activity against highly lethal and antimicrobial-resistant bacterial lung infections. These
“drugamer” therapeutics improve the activity of pulmonary drugs by targeting them to specific cell reservoirs in
the lung with high and extended dosing profiles. The inhalable platform could be used by infected patients before
hospitalization, to reduce administrations by patients in crowded hospitals, and contribute a key distributable
therapeutic and prophylactic modality that is needed to protect caregivers and disadvantaged populations. The
proposal is structured around 4 specific aims: (1) Develop remdesivir and baracitinib as first drugamer candidates
that exploit the lung macrophage as a reservoir to achieve extended dosing, as well as targeted designs against
lung epithelium viral reservoirs. Remdesivir and baracitinib prodrug monomers will be developed with
corresponding drugamer designs with mannose and peptide targeting ligands for the alveolar macrophage and
epithelial compartments, respectively; (2) Characterize and optimize the drugamer candidates by criteria of how
they load drugs into the lung macrophage and epithelial cells with extended dosing times. This will lead to better
understanding of how to optimize targeting strategies in the lung for future antiviral development. The
mechanisms will be studied by using quantitative LC-MS pharmacokinetics characterization and safety
characterization using lung inflammatory response assessments; (3) Assess and optimize drugamer activity
against SARS-CoV-2 using the hACE2 mouse model. Viral load and survival studies will be used to characterize
and develop optimized drugamer and drugamer combinations that could in the future be carried forward into
preclinical development. Compared to current formulation approaches, the drugamers exhibit higher drug
loading, the ability to co-formulate widely varying drugs for polytherapy, and individually tailorable drug PK
profiles that minimize burst release. The modularity of the platform, together with scaled and rapid manufacturing
response attributes, will allow diverse incorporation of other drugs as combinations. These favorable platform
attributes motivate this project to develop a new repertoire of current and future coronavirus therapeutic products."

relapse after initial therapy compared to HIV-uninfected cancer patients. Our prior work demonstrated that these

identify targetable drivers of the poor cancer outcomes experienced by PWH is urgently needed to improve
prognosis. We posit that cancer outcomes in PWH are negatively impacted by prolonged immune dysfunction
that results in accelerated biological aging. Biological aging can be quantified using genomic biomarkers, such
as DNA methylation translated into epigenetic clocks and presence of age-related clonal hematopoiesis (ARCH).
The overarching goal of this proposal is to compare biological age, measured using genomic biomarkers,
between cancer patients with versus without HIV and to quantify associations between measured biological age
with important clinical outcomes. Previous studies in PWH (without cancer) indicate that HIV-infected individuals
have higher biological age, calculated using blood-based epigenetic clocks, compared to their chronological age.
This accelerated aging was associated with increased mortality. ARCH has also been reportedly increased in
PWH. ARCH is characterized by acquired mutations that expand over time in blood cells. Accumulation of these
mutations is linked to increased inflammation and adverse outcomes. Data suggest that ARCH may be twice as
prevalent in PWH (without cancer) compared to HIV-uninfected persons. Thus, there is evidence for a link
between HIV and advanced genomic aging in PWH (without cancer), which warrants exploration in the context
of cancer. To preliminarily explore our hypothesis, we sequenced blood DNA from 30 solid tumor patients (15
PWH and 15 HIV-uninfected) matched on chronological age. Our preliminary data indicate that genomic aging
is more advanced in cancer patients with HIV. We observed significantly higher epigenetic-based biological age
in the PWH. We detected ARCH mutations in 3 PWH but 0 HIV-uninfected patients. The median survival in PWH
was only 2 years, compared to 9 years in HIV-uninfected patients; most striking was the <1-year median survival
in the PWH with ARCH. In this proposal, we will utilize an established protocol at Moffitt Cancer Center and
Huntsman Cancer Institute to prospectively collect biospecimens from 400 cancer patients (200 with and 200
without HIV). The investigation is timely and compelling given that cancer is now a leading cause of death in
PWH, and incidence is increasing. We propose the following aims: 1) Compare the biological age of cancer
patients with versus without HIV using epigenetic clocks; 2) Compare baseline prevalence and therapy-related
evolution of ARCH between cancer patients with and without HIV; and 3) Quantify the association between
genomic biomarkers of aging and clinical outcomes, including aging-related functional assessments. This study
will address the critical knowledge gap of whether cancer patients with HIV are biologically older than age-
matched cancer patients without HIV, and whether this advanced aging contributes to poor cancer outcomes."

This proposal seeks continued funding to expand and improve IPUMS CPS, an essential data resource for
research on population health and child well-being in the United States. IPUMS CPS streamlines access and
reduces technical barriers to analyzing data from the Current Population Survey (CPS), the nation's most
comprehensive source of data on the economic and social well-being of U.S. individuals and families, including
women of reproductive age and children. IPUMS CPS enables rigorous and reproducible research on population
dynamics and the social and economic contexts in which health inequities are created and reinforced, enabling
public policy based on sound scientific evidence.
Building on an impressive record of accomplishments since 2016, the project will undertake new initiatives to
ensure broad access, timely delivery, and innovative use of CPS data for population dynamics and population
health research. The project has five specific aims: (1) Database expansion to add more than eight million person
records by incorporating 65 new files that will be released between 2021 and 2026, including all CPS monthly
and supplement data; (2) Data and metadata improvement to enhance research opportunities, reproducibility,
and rigor; (3) Data access improvements to allow users to specify the combinations of CPS data they want
linked and the formats in which they will receive the data; (4) Data processing tool enhancement to reduce the
time to deliver new data to the research community and reduce the costs of maintaining the infrastructure over
the long run; (5) Expand and support the research community through targeted, thoughtful outreach, and active
user support and training.
CPS data are indispensable for analyzing demographic topics identified in the core mission of the NICHD
Population Dynamics Branch, including fertility, migration, population distribution, nuptiality, family demography,
population growth and decline, and the causes and consequences of demographic change. They also contain
rich measures of the most important non-clinical determinants of health and health inequities. The CPS is vital
for evaluating the consequences of social safety net policies for children, individuals, and families; the impact of
labor market disruption on marital transitions; and the implications of marital dissolution for economic well-being.
With data on entire households, analyses of individual-, couple-, family-, and household-level dynamics are
possible. Timely, user-friendly CPS data on the economic and social well-being of the U.S. population has never
been more urgently needed."

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a disabling illness that exhibits bimodal timing of onset, with up to half
of cases beginning in childhood. Subclinical obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) often precede the
development of clinically significant OCD, though symptoms in some children remit naturally over time.
However, the neural bases of OCS and their changes over development are poorly understood. Capitalizing on
large, publicly available datasets and sophisticated computational methods, I propose to examine functional
MRI signatures of OCS and their longitudinal trajectories in children and adolescents. Specifically, I will apply
machine learning to publicly available data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, a
prospective community sample tracked longitudinally at 21 diverse sites across the United States, to reveal
whole-brain functional MRI patterns that correspond to OCS severity. Baseline data is already available from
approximately 12,000 children aged 9-10 whose families have committed to ongoing follow-up. I will then use
data from the independent Healthy Brain Network (HBN) study, which includes data from approximately 2,500
children from the New York City area, to statistically and clinically validate these patterns (Aim 1). I will then
combine baseline neuroimaging and clinical data with longitudinal follow-up clinical data from the ABCD study
to examine neural signatures that predict subsequent OCS trajectories (Aim 2). Finally, I will leverage data
collected from children with clinical-severity OCS (i.e., OCD) before and after gold-standard cognitive
behavioral therapy at the New York State Psychiatric Institute (NYSPI) to identify pre-treatment predictors of
response and remission (Exploratory Aim). Collectively, these aims will identify brain connectivity features that
correspond to reliable patterns in which OCS co-vary, which could hint at common mechanisms underlying
multiple symptoms and implicate specific circuits that can be targeted in future studies aimed at developing
and testing novel treatments and prevention strategies. Furthermore, this research proposal integrates a
detailed training plan that will bring me closer to my goal of becoming a physician-scientist focused on clinical
and computational psychiatry. Supported by the resources of both Columbia University Irving Medical Center
and the NYSPI, I will deepen my technical skills in MRI image processing, neuroimaging analysis, and machine
learning, while also improving my scientific writing, oral presentation, and clinical skills."
10894718,"Immune therapy holds great promise to improve disease outcomes for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
(HNSCC) patients. The sixth most common cancer worldwide, HNSCC is a deadly and disfiguring disease that
accounted for more than 54,000 cases and 10,850 deaths in 2021 in the United States alone. Cases continue
to rise, in part due to increases in human papillomavirus (HPV) associated oropharynx cancers. The current
standard therapeutic regimens of surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy are associated with significant
morbidity and loss of quality of life with only modest 5-year survival rates. Immune therapy has offered new
options for HNSCC patients; treatment with T cell checkpoint inhibitors has led to gains in survival for 20-30% of
treated patients. However, the majority of HNSCC patients are resistant to T cell checkpoint inhibitors. Improved
therapeutic approaches that target additional mechanisms of immune escape are needed for this disease. Our
studies show that immune suppressive Tumor Associated Macrophages (TAMs) promote HNSCC immune
escape. We discovered that both tissue resident macrophages (TRM) and bone marrow derived macrophages
(BMDM) accumulate in HPV+ and HPV- HNSCC tumors, where they play distinct roles in promoting immune
suppression but also offer distinct vulnerabilities that can be targeted to promote tumor eradication. Targeting
proliferation pathways suppressed TRM accumulation and tumor progression while targeting the myeloid cell
specific phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase isoform gamma (PI3Kg) suppressed BMDM
accumulation. Furthermore, PI3Kg inhibition promoted pro-inflammatory macrophage polarization that
synergized with checkpoint inhibitors to enhance recruitment and activation of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, leading to
tumor eradication. These results indicated that therapeutic strategies that target TAMs as well as T cell
checkpoints could improve HNSCC patient outcomes. Biomarker studies in clinical trials showed that PI3Kg
antagonism stimulated enhanced T cell recruitment and activation in HNSCC patients. Therefore, we propose to
test the overall hypothesis that therapeutic strategies that block macrophage accumulation and immune
suppression will improve therapeutic outcomes in HNSCC disease. The specific aims of this proposal are: 1) To
identify and target mechanisms controlling macrophage accumulation in HNSCC tumors. 2) To determine how
macrophage plasticity can be harnessed to inhibit HNSCC tumor progression. 3) To develop novel immune
therapeutic strategies and immune biomarkers for HNSCC disease."

Cells have evolved complex machinery for both the replication of DNA and for repairing errors in
DNA. Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV) is a large double strand DNA virus that replicates in the
nucleus of the host cell and commandeers some of this host replication machinery. Despite
decades of study, the mechanisms of HSV DNA replication are still poorly understood. The
incoming genome contains nicks and gaps, and it is not known when or if these are repaired in
relation to the timing of DNA synthesis. HSV encodes seven essential DNA replication proteins
including an origin binding protein, a single strand DNA (ssDNA) binding protein (ICP8), a three-
subunit helicase/primase (UL5/UL8/UL52), and a two-subunit polymerase (UL30/UL42). In
addition, HSV also encodes a two-unit recombinase consisting of a 5'-3' exonuclease (UL12) that
functions with ICP8. Isolation of proteins on nascent DNA (iPOND) is a powerful tool to study DNA
replication because it allows for the specific purification of replication forks away from bulk
chromatin. When coupled with SILAC (stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture)-based
quantitative proteomics, the iPOND-SILAC-MS method provides a robust, unbiased discovery
tool to identify fork associated proteins by determining the intensity of proteins in a pulse sample
compared to a chase sample. We have utilized iPOND-SILAC-MS to generate robust data sets
of the protein composition of HSV replication forks and replication forks lacking UL12. In the
absence of UL12 a cellular deubiquitinating enzyme, USP15, is not recruited to replication forks.
USP15 interacts directly with UL12 and is required for efficient HSV replication. In addition to viral
proteins, many cellular proteins are enriched on viral replication forks. In twelve iPOND-SILAC-
MS we have identified 200-300 proteins (viral and host) enriched on HSV DNA replication forks.
 The overall goal of this research proposal is to identify the host proteins associated with
viral DNA to generate a more complete understanding of the mechanisms of HSV DNA
replication. To this end we will address three overlapping research areas in my laboratory: 1)
Characterize the physical interaction of UL12 with USP15, 2) Identify the human replisome
proteins required for HSV DNA replication, 3) Determine the fate of the nicks and gaps in the
incoming viral genome."

Chronic kidney disease is a powerful risk factor for subclinical left ventricular systolic dysfunction and incident
heart failure, but the mechanisms of these relationships remain incompletely understood. The inflammasome
drives renal and cardiac inflammation by activating the inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β and interleukin-18
and the pyroptotic protein gasdermin-D. In patients with systolic heart failure or coronary artery disease,
pharmacologic interleukin-1β blockade improves left ventricular systolic function and maximal exercise capacity
and is associated with a trend towards fewer heart failure hospitalizations. Exogenous interleukin-18
administration to wild-type mice impairs left ventricular systolic function whereas blocking interleukin-18 after
experimental myocardial infarction preserves left ventricular systolic function. Furthermore, interleukin-1β’s
cardiodepressant effects are mediated in part by interleukin-18, suggesting that simultaneous blockade of both
cytokines would confer additional benefit beyond targeting either cytokine alone. The broad goal of this
application is to prepare the principal investigator, Dr. Leo Buckley PharmD, for a career as an independent,
patient-oriented researcher who studies cardiovascular pharmacology with a specific interest in preventing and
treating heart failure by identifying and targeting pathways that regulate myocardial structure and function. In
addition to focused coursework and seminars, Dr. Buckley will complete a series of patient-oriented studies
under the guidance of an expert mentoring committee to test the hypothesis that inflammasome activity
contributes to incident heart failure risk in adults with chronic kidney disease by promoting left ventricular systolic
dysfunction. He will address two specific aims: (1) that increased inflammasome activity associates with left
ventricular systolic dysfunction and increased risk of incident heart failure in older adults; and (2) To test the
hypothesis that colchicine improves left ventricular systolic function and reduces inflammasome activity in
patients with uremic cardiomyopathy. These studies will improve our knowledge of and spur further investigations
into the role of inflammatory cytokines in the pathogenesis of subclinical left ventricular dysfunction and heart
failure. By the conclusion of the award, Dr. Buckley will have established an independent, patient-oriented
cardiovascular pharmacology research program."

10839306,"Project Abstract/Summary
 The ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) is an integral part of determining protein fate. Proteins are
marked with ubiquitin for degradation by the proteasome through the activity of an enzymatic cascade
(ubiquitination). Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) remove ubiquitin from proteins rescuing them from
degradation1. Together ubiquitination and deubiquitination control protein stability and homeostasis and are
essential for metazoan development and aberrant regulation implicated in disease such as cancer. Inhibitors of
the UPS, such as Bortezomib, are effective cancer therapeutics. With knowledge of the structure and function of
DUBs, inhibitors for DUBs can be developed as precision therapies. An example of an application of DUB
inhibitors in cancer biology is stabilization of oncoproteins, such as c-Myc1, that are stabilized by a DUB. Valosin
containing protein p97/p47 complex interacting protein 1 (VCPIP1), a member of the OTU family of DUBs2, is a
cysteine protease that, like many of the DUBs, has been identified as a therapeutic vulnerability in human
cancers3. Its known close interactor, valosin containing protein (VCP)4, is a key player in the UPS system as it
unfolds a variety of poly-ubiquitinated substrates prior to their degradation by the proteosome, and is itself a
promising therapeutic target5. The protein unfolding by VCP is remarkable and unique as it is able to unfold
ubiquitin, a notoriously stable protein that initiates the unfolding of poly-ubiquitinated substrates6 prior to DUB
activity at the bottom of the channel. There is no knowledge as to how and why VCPIP1 binds to VCP.
 Preliminary data from a co-purification from mammalian cells and immuno-precipitation mass
spectrometry (IP-MS) confirm that VCPIP1 interacts with VCP. Using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), initial
data collection using a Talos Arctica and data processing with cryoSPARC7 resulted in high quality 2D classes
with secondary structure features and, ultimately, a 3.3 Å 3D reconstruction. Titan Krios data collection of
chemically crosslinked sample resulted in a 3.0 Å reconstruction of the complex without substrate. This provided
initial insights into the interaction site of VCPIP1 and VCP and the general stoichiometry of the complex.
 Using structural and biochemical methods, this proposal aims to elucidate the structure of VCPIP1 and
its mechanism of interaction with VCP, why VCPIP1 forms a complex with VCP and how it acts on clients. This
effort together with initial hit compounds will enable the development of inhibitors for VCPIP1. Specifically,
Specific Aim 1 aims to solve a high-resolution structure of VCPIP1 bound to VCP using cryo-EM and to
biochemically characterize the interaction between VCPIP1 and VCP by structure-function studies. Specific Aim
2 aims to determine a high-resolution structure of the VCPIP1/VCP complex bound to a substrate and adaptors,
fluorescence/enzymology assays will be used to demonstrate deubiquitylation by VCPIP1 after substrate
unfolding by VCP. Specific Aim 3 aims to use structure-based drug design (SBDD), both computationally and
experimentally, to discover and improve VCPIP1 inhibitors."

 This project responds to NIH Directors TRA RFA-RM-20-013 and will test the hypothesis that homeostatic
restoration of small GTPase signaling to modify Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)
pathogenesis is a game-changing therapeutic approach compared to unidirectional targeting. If proven, this new
and innovative paradigm will have far-reaching and transformative impact for targeting other chronic diseases
and disorders such as autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, and drug addiction.
 The predominant and conventional therapeutic strategies in treating human diseases are unidirectionally
inhibiting or stimulating affected biological processes. However, in many chronic diseases such as AD and ALS,
complete inhibition or activation of the affected signaling events may themselves promote diseases. Disease
progression can also be spatiotemporal, with initial activation followed by inhibition or vice versa, as well as
activation versus inhibition at different brain regions. Thus, simple unidirectional targeting may itself be a major
reason that no drugs have successfully prevented, reversed or even modified the disease course for such
neurodegenerative disorders. To overcome this formidable challenge, new therapeutic paradigms must be
investigated. One approach is to restore homeostatic balance instead of completely inhibiting or activating the
affected signaling pathways. This approach is largely untested for AD and ALS but is broadly significant because
many other complex diseases also exhibit homeostatic imbalance and spatiotemporal dysregulation of signaling
pathways, making the use of inhibitors or activators ineffective if used inappropriately.
 This TRA project proposes to restore the homeostatic balance of Rho and Rab family small GTPase
signaling, which is spatiotemporally dysregulated in AD and ALS. The classical Rho GTPases include RhoA,
Rac1, and Cdc42, in which RhoA often acts in opposition to Rac1 and Cdc42 to control protein processing and
trafficking as well as synaptic remodeling. Rab GTPases additionally control ER stress and protein aggregation.
Our project will apply innovative dual function small molecules to investigate this antagonism for restoring
their homeostatic balance. We will determine the effects of their modulation on AD and ALS hallmark proteins
and pathogenesis in mouse models. If successful, this project will deliver novel first-in-class drug leads, and the
new therapeutic paradigm will transform the entire AD and ALS drug development landscape and beyond.
 In summary, our proposal provides a strong rationale for the transformative impact of establishing
homeostatic targeting at defective signaling processes in AD and ALS. With a multi-institution and multi-
disciplinary approach, this project will lead to novel and significant insights into whether targeting homeostatic
balances of defective signaling can modify AD and ALS disease course, providing a pioneering example of
applying the same approach for future targeting of other chronic and slow progression diseases."

Most lymphomas and multiple myeloma (MM) are malignancies resulting from the unrestrained clonal
proliferation of B-cells at different stages of maturation. For nearly two decades, the International Lymphoma
Epidemiology (InterLymph) Consortium has systematically uncovered genetic and non-genetic lymphoma
and MM risk factors. We aim to build upon nearly 20 years of successful collaboration within the InterLymph
Consortium to undertake the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) of lymphomas and MM to date,
to assess the performance of polygenic risk scores for lymphomas, and to identify gene-environment
interactions associated with disease susceptibility. This will address key questions: specifically, can we fully
elucidate the genetic variants involved in susceptibility MM, HL, and NHL subtypes? How do the genetic
profiles overlap? How do these profiles interact with the environmental risk factors? With further precision,
can factors be combined to assist in risk prediction? In Aim 1, we will undertake the largest genome wide
association study (GWAS) to date of ~60,000 lymphoma cases, including HL (N=~6,700), NHL
(N=~36,000) and MM (N=~16,000) and over 197,000 controls. In Aim 2, we will develop polygenic risk
scores (PRS), including conducting a validation of the PRS in an independent series of 13,700 lymphoma
patients. In Aim 3, we will evaluate GWAS and subtype-specific PRS in the context of select
environmental exposure data to gain novel insight into exposure-disease relationships and potentially
uncover novel susceptibility loci which act only in the presence of specific environmental triggers. Finally, in
Aim 4, we will create a platform hub for the InterLymph Consortium. This platform, called the Data
Coordinating Center (DCC), will ensure that the field's most pertinent, cutting edge hypothesis driven
research questions can be applied within the resources of the InterLymph Consortium. Through this project,
we aim to activate the collective intelligence and resources of the InterLymph researchers in order to expand
our understanding of how genetic variants and the environment influence risk of lymphomas and explore how
this may assist clinical practice."
10911178,"The objective of the proposed project is to develop a Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) prediction
model to identify individuals who have high risk for PDAC in the next 3 years through Artificial Intelligence (AI)
analysis of pre-diagnostic CT images and non-imaging factors. PDAC is the fourth leading cause of cancer-
related deaths in both men and women in the United States despite its low incidence rate. The 5-year survival
rate for all stages of PDAC is 10% but can be as high as 50% with early-stage diagnosis. Therefore,
identification of individuals at high risk for PDAC has high clinical significance as follow-up imaging
examinations or biopsy may assist in early detection and allow surgical intervention while the tumors are still
resectable. However, PDAC prediction is difficult due to the lack of reliable screening tools, the absence of
sensitive and specific symptoms and biomarkers, and low prevalence.
 Abdominal pain is the single most common reason that Americans visit the emergency room (ER), where
an abdominal Computed Tomography (CT) scan is usually performed. Even though most scans don’t show
any signs of cancer visible to the naked eyes of radiologists, some subjects eventually develop PDAC in the
next few years. These pre-diagnostic CT images provide critical morphological information associated with
biological changes at the pre-cancer or early cancer stage, which can be extracted using AI to predict PDAC
risk. Therefore, the objective of the proposed project is to uncover unique features in pre-diagnostic images
using AI and develop PDAC prediction model based on these features. Non-imaging factors such as
demographic, epidemiologic, and anthropometric factors, clinical comorbidities, and laboratory tests will be
included in the model to improve the prediction accuracy. The primary hypotheses are a) AI allows extraction
of unique image features in pre-diagnostic CT images associated with pre-cancer or early cancer biological
changes that are invisible to naked eyes and b) the combination of pre-diagnostic image features and non-
imaging factors improves the accuracy of PDAC risk stratification and prediction over that using conventional
non-imaging factors alone. To verify these hypotheses, we will retrospectively evaluate CT pancreatic images
obtained up to 3 years prior to PDAC diagnosis that were deemed non-cancerous by radiologists. A group of
subjects who underwent similar imaging studies for non-gastrointestinal disorders and were age/gender
matched with pre-diagnostic imaging will serve as healthy controls. Accurately stratifying high risk individuals
may allow for early detection of PDAC in the future. A major challenge of the project is the scarcity of the
appropriate imaging data because of the low prevalence of PDAC and stringent enrollment criteria. Eight major
medical centers will participate in collection of 1,064 cases. The end point of this project is the development,
training, and validation of an AI-based PDAC prediction model, which will identify individuals who are at high
risk for developing PDAC within the next 3 years."

 The Georgia Department of Agriculture (GDA) is the state agency responsible for regulation of
food manufactured facilities and retail establishments. GDA Laboratories (Lab) are the primary servicing
laboratories for the regulatory programs and are focused on food analysis for chemical and
microbiological contaminants. Since 2011, GDA has pursued FDA grants and cooperative agreements to
improve and harmonize our state regulatory and testing capability. Through these grants the Lab
achieved accreditation to ISO 17025 international standards which allows our regulatory agencies to
perform contractual work on behalf of FDA. Since GDA is Georgia’s regulatory authority over food retail
establishments, the agency has inspectors positioned all throughout The State of Georgia. These
inspectors are trained to collect samples and return them to our lab for testing that can support
regulatory enforcement.
 Since GDA already has infrastructure designated for sample collection at retail establishments
and the analysis of microorganisms by the Lab, this award opportunity NARMS (National Antimicrobial
Resistance Monitory System) should make a good fit to be implemented by GDA. The Georgia
Department of Public Health (GDPH) Laboratory is currently awarded this grant but has contacted GDA
to request assistance or taking it over since the COVID 19 pandemic has become their top priority.
 In summary, GDA inspectors will collect the samples and send them to the Lab per routine
protocols. The Lab will screen the samples for the target organisms suggested in the Funding
Opportunity Award (FOA). The Lab will utilize methods described in the project protocol in addition to
screening by approved and validated ELISA or PCR platforms. Isolates showing typical characteristics will
be further examined and confirmed or sent to FDA for further evaluation. As needed, GDPH has agreed
to also assist in in Whole Genome Sequencing of the isolates, since GDA does not currently have that
ability, in addition to mentoring of the methods and program until fully established.
 The Lab has developed and demonstrated successful relationships with their regulatory partners
and the GDPH Lab, which should indicate its ability to fulfill this objective. The Lab also routinely
performs thousands of microbiological analyses on retail food samples annually. If awarded, GDA will be
capable of enhancing and strengthening antimicrobial resistance surveillance data. This in turn can be
used to inform public health stakeholders about populations of resistant strains and if current policy and
practices are adequate for overall safety of consumers."

Over 80% of emergency department (ED) patients with acute heart failure (AHF) are admitted to
the hospital, with only 10% at high-risk for in-hospital events. We developed and validated a
prediction rule (STRATIFY) that identifies ED patients with AHF that may be safe to discharge. If
successfully implemented, it will save substantial resources without sacrificing patient outcomes
and help institutions achieve goals for accountable care. Real-world adoption of prediction rules
for AHF and other conditions treated in the ED is challenged by barriers such as time-pressured
workflow, real-time data availability and quality. A solution would have considerable implications
for implementing any clinical decision algorithm. The central objective of this grant is to develop
a multilevel approach and the necessary statistical methods to close the gap in implementation
of our AHF risk prediction tool, as a model for other automated risk prediction approaches within
an electronic health records system. Through inter-disciplinary collaboration among ED
physicians, biostatisticians, qualitative research experts, implementation scientists and
bioinformaticians, we propose to rigorously develop and test a clinical decision support-based
approach including 1) robust stakeholder engagement to participate in user-centered design
and identify approaches to overcome barriers to implementation, 2) overcoming real-time data
integration challenges through statistical methods, and 3) a detailed evaluation of effectiveness
and implementation in multiple centers. Our proposal will have a broad impact on both acute
care practice and risk model implementation by closing the gap between scientific discovery and
health care delivery using risk prediction tools. Importantly, the methods developed here will
generalize to other risk prediction tools and be readily translatable to other complex ED-based
diseases such as pulmonary embolism, stroke, and COPD, thereby maximizing opportunity for
impact both scientifically and on patient care."

As a gateway for a clinician-scientist career, this T35 Summer Program (“The Northwestern Summer Research
Program for Medical Students”), aims to offer academically promising medical students from five medical schools
in the greater Chicago area (FSM, Loyola, Chicago, Illinois at Chicago, and Rosalind Franklin) a rich and didactic
summer research basic science or outcomes research experience in NIDDK areas of interest. Feinberg School
of Medicine (FSM) does not have a T35 program and has assembled 33 federally, primarily NIDDK funded T35
mentors with excellent mentorship track record for 8 T35 trainees from a pool of ~880 first-year medical students
(25% URM and 52% women). Champions at each medical school participate to facilitate recruitment. Events,
such as a T35 Meet-and-Greet, where interested students meet potential T35 mentors and student/mentor
matching through the PD and T35 Committees facilitate the application process. The selection process is
rigorous and transparent with special emphasis on selecting the most competitive URM and female students.
The selected T35 trainees engage in an onboarding process prior to the summer, that includes and Onboarding
Lunch, training modules for IRB and RCR, as well as introduction to the pertinent literature by the T35 mentor.
The Summer program allows the T35 trainees to immerse themselves in their research project with their T35
mentors for 8 weeks (June-August). Daily T35 Lunch Lectures introduce the trainees to basics skills and
knowledge related to performing research, followed by lectures from T35 mentors about their NIDDK research
and their academic pathway. Weekly check-in occurs with the PD at the T35 Trainee Meetings allowing for cross-
fertilization of trainees, progress reports and mitigation of road blocks. Mid-summer a NIDDK funded visiting
professor will come for annual T35 Retreat, allowing for a full day exchange with the trainees. The summer
concludes with a Poster Session where students present their research to faculty and staff. Ongoing feedback
is solicited during the summer for lectures and the program and T35 mentors are evaluated by the trainees at
the end of the summer to offer programmatic improvements. A concluding 1-page summary or preferably an
abstract submission to a national meeting is expected. T35 trainees are highly encouraged to continue their
research with their T35 mentor throughout their medical school tenure. Ongoing mentorship is provided in
expected bi-annual meetings with the T35 mentor during medical school and networking opportunities are
provided at the Meet-and-Greet, Onboarding Lunch, T35 Retreat and Poster Session. The T35 program enjoys
the enthusiastic support from the Dean's office and participation of leaders from all participating schools,
department, centers and institutes in diverse T35 Committees."

 Human estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) is a molecular driver of hormone-responsive cell
proliferation in breast cancer. Acquired ERα mutations—Y537S and D538G being the two most
commonly found—represent a newly recognized mechanism of drug resistance due to their
constitutive transcription activity. Our preliminary data and recently published reports indicate that
these drug-resistant mutants are non-conventional therapeutic targets for small molecule binding
to modulate their activity and inhibit cell proliferation. However, the mechanisms by which drug-
resistant mutations act on the receptor to regulate hormonal signaling and the extent to which
small molecule inhibitors bind the receptor for intervention are not yet known.
 The ERα harbors two major functional entities, i.e., the DNA-binding domain (DBD) and
the ligand-binding domain (LBD). We recently reported the multi-domain assembly and revealed
the mode of interactions between these two domains, through a previously uncharacterized
domain-bridging interface. Specifically, mutations at the domain-interface prevent the two
domains from communicating and inhibit ERα activity, highlighting the modulation of the domain-
interface as an “allosteric” channel with loss/gain of receptor function. This functional significance
raises the questions of (a) whether the drug-resistant mutations alter the domain-domain
assembly and the mode of DBD-LBD interactions, and (b) whether/how the domain-bridging
interface can be targeted by small molecules to disrupt receptor activity. Our preliminary studies
show that a repurposed small molecule binds the receptor via the domain-interface and inhibits
ERα-mediated cellular function. Based on these findings and other preliminary data, we
hypothesize that how the ERα domains interact with one another is influenced by these drug-
resistant mutations and this domain-domain interaction is critical for small molecule binding to
alter receptor function. To test this hypothesis, we will characterize the multi-domain assemblies
of disease-resistant mutants (Y537S/D538G) and examine the molecular and functional
correlation of inhibitor-receptor binding. In contrast to the hormone-binding pocket where all
current drugs bind, this study will provide novel insights into the ERα domain-interface as a new
target site for small molecule binding, and ultimately offer a much-needed molecular
understanding of ER-positive breast cancer therapy resistance."
10903992,"Cancer research and treatment have greatly benefited from advances in DNA sequencing methods, which
have accelerated the discovery of genes that, when mutated, promote tumorigenesis. The protein products of
some of these oncogenes have served as direct targets for groundbreaking new medicines. Many oncogenes,
however, code for proteins that lack chemical probes and are even considered undruggable. In these cases,
our understanding of the molecular basis of cancer has not yet translated into effective new therapies. A similar
gap can be found in cancer-related immunology (or immuno-oncology), where human genetics is discovering
proteins that play fundamental roles in innate and adaptive immunity; yet, again, most of these proteins lack
chemical probes. A critical challenge has thus emerged in cancer research – how can the massive gains in
understanding of cancer and immunology bequeathed by modern human genetics be translated into new
therapies for cancer? The goal of this research program is to leverage and extend our lab’s innovative activity-
based protein profiling (ABPP) technology to radically expand the druggable content of the human proteome
and develop high-quality chemical probes for genetically-defined protein targets in cancer and immuno-
oncology. We have recently introduced advanced ABPP platforms that evaluate small-molecule interactions
across thousands of proteins in parallel directly in native biological systems. By combining proteome-wide
druggability maps of human cancer and immune cells furnished by ABPP with human genetic information, we
have identified several high-priority cancer targets poised for chemical probe development. Optimized chemical
probes will be used by our lab and a set of expert biology collaborators to characterize the functional relevance
of protein targets in cancer and cancer-related immunology. We will also describe plans for continued
technology innovation to further enhance chemical probe and target discovery by ABPP, including the following
objectives – i) identify newly druggable E3 ligase systems capable of supporting targeted protein degradation
in cancer cells; ii) discover chemical probes that selectively engage modified states of protein targets in cancer
cells; and iii) generate advanced chemical libraries for ABPP to further increase the druggable fraction of the
human cancer proteome. In summary, our research program should deliver high-quality chemical probes for,
and pharmacological validation of, biologically compelling human cancer targets, providing critical knowledge
to direct the future development of transformative cancer therapeutics. More generally, we envision that our
research program will inspire chemical and cancer biologists to embrace the potential druggability of any
human protein, as well as provide an experimental roadmap to realize this goal, for the benefit of both basic
and translational research."
10898817,"Project Summary
The broad goal is to develop and apply computational methods for building structural models of proteins and
their assemblies. One successful approach, integrative structure modeling, casts the building of such models as
a computational optimization problem where knowledge about the assembly is encoded into the scoring function
used to evaluate candidate models. We propose to extend and enhance the Integrative Modeling Platform (IMP)
program that provides programmatic support for developing and distributing integrative structure modeling pro-
tocols. IMP already allows representing molecules at multiple resolutions, using spatial restraints from many
types of data, and searching for solutions by a variety of sampling algorithms. So far, it has been applied mostly
to data from electron microscopy (EM), mass spectrometry, small angle X-ray scattering, Förster resonance
energy transfer, crosslinking, hydrogen deuterium exchange (HDX), and various proteomics methods. IMP is
easily extensible to add support for new data sources and algorithms, and is distributed under an open source
license. Here, we propose to extend IMP to address a greater range of biological problems and make it
more generally useful to the scientific community. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will develop integrative threading
for computing an atomic model based on a density map determined at medium resolution (4-8 Å) by EM or X-
ray crystallography. This goal will be achieved by simultaneously sampling both threading and conformation
based on the density map as well as other data, such as chemical cross-links and HDX protection factors. This
method is significant because it will produce atomic resolution models from medium-resolution maps determined
by either EM or X-ray crystallography. In Aim 2, we will develop a Bayesian integrative method for modeling
ensembles of similar systems. Data from different samples, ensembles, and/or variants are often pooled together
to model a single representative structure. This synthesis is problematic when the variation between the actual
structures across the samples, ensembles, and variants is larger than the uncertainty of the data. We will address
the challenge by developing a general and flexible scheme for representing and scoring related structural en-
sembles. This method is significant because it will improve the accuracy of the model and the estimate of its
uncertainty. In Aim 3, we will maximize the impact of IMP on the community, by delivering a well-tested and
maintained software package that is documented with mailing lists, examples, and demonstrations at local and
external workshops, by hosting select users at UCSF, and by pursuing closer integration with other software
packages and community resources, including databases such as the Protein Data Bank (PDB), structure view-
ers such as Chimera and VMD, and other modeling programs such as NAMD and ReaDDy. The proposed aims
are informed by and will shape the nascent worldwide PDB effort on representing, validating, archiving, and
disseminating integrative structure models."

 The establishment of neuronal connectivity requires axons to select the proper neurons to form synapses with, which can
be achieved through guidance signals or through activity-dependent processes. We still have a poor understanding of the
mechanisms and molecules that direct neuronal specific connectivity pattern. The Drosophila color vision circuit offers a
powerful paradigm to study synaptic specificity because of the availability of a connectome, a deep knowledge of its
development, and powerful genetic tools to manipulate the circuit.
 In the fly retina, color photoreceptors R7 and R8 are stochastically specified, whereas their neuronal medulla targets are
produced through a highly deterministic program. We will study how this propagation is achieved. Activity-dependent
neural patterning is another powerful mean to coordinate different brain regions. Neuronal activity can occur at early
developmental stages, prior to sensory input and the onset of synaptogenesis in the form of calcium waves whose
significance has not yet been fully elucidated. We will study how early waves of activity that we observe at a very specific
time point during fly retinal development are generated and what role they play.
Aim 1. How do stochastically determined photoreceptor subtypes find their targets in the optic lobes?
 Aim 1.1. Synaptic specificity downstream of color photoreceptors: We will identify medulla neurons specific to
subsets of photoreceptors and will identify the factors involved in the recognition by their input neurons.
 Aim 1.2. Establishment of synaptic specificity downstream of R7 color photoreceptors: We will study how a
family of cell adhesion molecules allows matching between R7 cells and their Dm8 targets in the brain
 Aim 1.3. How does information from p and yR7 propagate downstream of Dm8: Once a medulla cell has made
contacts with its cognate photoreceptor, it must itself transmits this information to its downstream partners. We will
investigate how these choices are propagated down the visual pathway.
 Aim 1.4. Apoptotic pathway regulating the culling of unconnected neurons: Target neurons that are not connected
die. We will study how specific adhesion molecules regulate this death and the molecular pathways involved.
Aim 2. Mechanisms and functions of waves of spontaneous activity in the retina
 Aim 2.1. Description and cellular substrates of retinal calcium waves: We will analyze which cells are involved in
calcium waves and whether these waves propagate to downstream medulla regions.
 Aim 2.2. Molecular mechanisms of retinal calcium waves: We will study how ER calcium stores and gap junction
proteins are required to generate and propagate the waves.
 Aim 2.3. Determine the developmental role of retinal calcium waves: By disrupting the calcium waves, we will
study what role they play in patterning the retina, and/or medulla neurons that are targets of photoreceptors."
10907540,"Project Summary/Abstract
Glioblastoma (GBM), the most common primary brain tumor, has a 15 month patient survival due to inevitable
recurrence of tumor despite standard treatment – temozolomide chemotherapy (TMZ), radiation, and surgery.
It is critical to characterize and target genes modulating GBM chemoresistance. Long noncoding RNAs
(lncRNAs) are a novel class of genetic transcripts comprising 80% of the genome. These lncRNAs induce
profound alterations in transcriptional regulation and phenotype, including chemotherapy response. Because
few GBM lncRNAs have been studied, characterizing new candidates among this abundant and novel class of
genes may significantly improve chemotherapeutic efficacy. To assess lncRNAs involved in GBM
chemotherapy resistance, we identified linc02454 among the most highly upregulated lncRNAs following TMZ
treatment. Knockdown (KD) of linc02454 decreased in vitro GBM cell viability in response to TMZ, while RNA-
seq identified CXC-chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) among the most heavily downregulated genes after
lncRNA KD. CXCR4 is a well-characterized modulator of GBM chemoresistance, currently targeted in multiple
clinical trials. We hypothesize TMZ regulates linc02454 expression and that linc02454 exerts GBM resistance
to TMZ through modulation of CXCR4. In this project, we will evaluate the role of linc02454 on GBM response
to TMZ treatment. In aim 1, we identify if linc02454 relies upon increased CXCR4 expression, assessing
functional interaction via epistasis and CXCR4 rescue, as well as evaluating whether linc02454 directly
regulates CXCR4 via Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization. In aim 2, we will assess how TMZ increases
linc02454. SA2.1 will perform integrative analysis of lncRNA methylation at DNA loci (including linc02454) and
methylation-dependent lncRNA transcription at initial resection/recurrence. SA2.2 will assess chromatin state
of linc02454 before and after TMZ. In aim 3, we will assess if linc02454 repression, when combined with TMZ
+ radiotherapy, improves treatment response, in vitro and in vivo. These aims will examine whether lin02454
meditates GBM response to TMZ via CXCR4 and how linc02454 is regulated by TMZ exposure. We will also
test whether linc02454 is a potential therapeutic target in GBM therapy. If successful, this five-year study will
provide a more thorough understanding of lncRNA biology in the context of TMZ-induced treatment resistance.
 With my mentorship group, we have developed a career development plan for tailored training in
transcriptional regulation of GBM lncRNAs. The project will be closely supervised through regular one-on-one
interaction with primary mentor Dr. Yali Dou, an international expert in chromatin and transcriptional regulation
in cancer. NIH-funded co-mentors, Dr. Behnam Badie, a neurosurgeon focusing on GBM biology, and Dr.
William Mack also have extensive experience mentoring neurosurgeon-scientists to independence, and have
functioned as close mentors. Importantly, by completing this work, I will develop expertise in transcriptional
regulation, a critical component in the function of lncRNAs and treatment-induced changes in GBM."
10909124,"The population burden of cirrhosis is rising especially related to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), alcohol-
induced liver disease (ALD) and in those living with HIV. The progression of cirrhosis to liver-associated clinical
events (LACE) and death is related to a diverse set of systemic and hepatic factors which may be etiology-
specific or agnostic. There remain gaps in knowledge in assessing how these factors interact to cause cirrhosis-
progression to outcomes. This limits rational development of non-invasive tools for risk-stratification and
disease-monitoring purposes as well as the ability to holistically model the development of outcomes. There is
also no established etiology-agnostic approach to reduce the risk of outcomes and death. This proposal, in
response to RFA-DK-20-003, addresses these unmet needs with two specific aims: Aim 1: To conduct a
prospective, multicenter, observational study of patients with cirrhosis of varying etiology that serves as the
foundation for conducting novel mechanistic and therapeutic studies. Patients with compensated cirrhosis of
varying etiology inclusive of NASH, ALD with and without HIV will be enrolled and followed prospectively with
protocol-driven data and bio-sample collection. Outcomes will be assessed prospectively by a pre-specified
adjudication process. Through collaboration with external partners, we will evaluate several promising tools
(e.g. spleen-stiffness measurement), circulating biomarkers (PROC3-6, ELF test) and machine-learned
approaches to obtain novel insights on fibrosis, factors driving outcomes and to model outcomes. The cohort
data and bio-samples will further support mechanistic studies of factors driving fibrosis and outcomes. Aim 2:
To perform a multi-center prospective randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the
clinical utility of atorvastatin (10 mg/day x 2 yrs) in patients with compensated cirrhosis. Patients with
compensated cirrhosis of varying etiology, stratified by varices and CTP score (5 or 6) will be enrolled. The trial
design uses the estimand framework proposed by the FDA (ICH E9 R1). The primary endpoint captures benefit
from a patient-perspective and is defined by survival without LACE or major adverse cardiac event or need for
drug withdrawal for toxicity. The primary analysis will be a comparison of proportions of patients meeting the
primary endpoint. The secondary analysis of benefit is a time-to-event analysis of clinical outcomes. Several
measures to track safety and de-risk the study are proposed. A benefit-risk analyses using state of the art
approach is proposed. Together, they will provide robust information on the utility of atorvastatin to improve
outcomes in compensated cirrhosis. The feasibility of the studies is supported by a strong and extensive referral
network, a robust tele-medicine program for liver disease and research infrastructure. The studies will have a
major positive impact by: (1) providing robust outcomes data, (2) supporting mechanistic studies, (3) use of
innovations to refine application of NITs, (4) model clinical outcome risk to inform future monitoring strategies,
and (5) provide a treatment to slow this progression, thereby providing a way to reduce the burden of cirrhosis."
10903770,"BRAF, a member of the RAF family protein kinases, works in the MAPK signaling pathway, which controls broad
cellular events like proliferation and differentiation. BRAF is the most frequently mutated kinase in human
cancers. Furthermore, tumors lacking BRAF mutations are contingent on BRAF activity when there are mutations
in upstream pathway members, such as RAS or growth factor receptors. Thus, BRAF represents an important
target for cancer therapy. Despite three decades of intense research, only recently has a sufficient understanding
of BRAF's mechanism creaked open the door to BRAF therapy. However, the current clinical BRAF inhibitors,
vemurafenib and dabrafenib, are limited to the class I mutant BRAFV600E. Vemurafenib and dabrafenib, the two
ATP-competitive inhibitors, can paradoxically activate non-BRAFV600E and wild-type BRAF, suggesting that
BRAF has functions that are independent of its kinase activity. Therapeutic strategies for tumors with non-
BRAFV600E mutations and wild-type BRAF are still lacking. Gaps in our knowledge contributed to the limitations
of ATP-competitive BRAF drugs. The proposed work centers around three questions regarding RAF activation
and regulation in health and disease states. Q1: how BRAF structural elements and ATP binding mediate the
catalytic-independent functions of non-BRAFV600E and wild-type BRAF? Q2: what is the mechanism of action of
the first BRAF allosteric inhibitor developed by our group and how can inhibitors targeting the catalytic and non-
catalytic functions of BRAF be developed? Q3: What factors contribute to the non-overlapping functions of RAF
isoforms, despite their structural similarity? The PI and her team will address these questions through
multidisciplinary approaches, including X-ray crystallography, binding kinetics, phosphoproteomics, live cell
imaging, chemical biology, and computational methods. Our findings will not only facilitate a better understanding
of the complex biochemical mechanisms of the RAF kinase family, also provide a molecular basis for novel
therapeutic approaches targeting BRAF-driven tumors."
10904926,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is an urgent public health issue which contributes to over one million
hospitalizations annually. Depression undermines optimal recovery following ACS, often at least partially
through interference with health behaviors. Post-ACS patients with depression smoke more, adhere to
medications less often, are less physically active, and have poorer diet than post-ACS patients without
depression. This reduced adherence to recommended health behaviors, in turn, worsens cardiovascular health
and increases risk of additional morbidity and mortality. Our team developed Behavioral Activation for Health
and Depression (BA-HD) which is a behavioral activation-based intervention that integrates treatment for
depression and multiple health behavior change post-ACS. The overarching goal of this R34 application is to
pilot BA-HD across three distinct regions (Northeast, Midwest, and Southeast) in preparation for a subsequent
fully powered multisite randomized controlled efficacy trial. Specifically, the research team will conduct a
multisite pilot randomized controlled feasibility trial of BA-HD comparing the intervention to an Enhanced Usual
Care (EUC) control group. This trial will accomplish two aims: First, we will examine study feasibility (e.g.,
recruitment, treatment engagement, retention) and acceptability of both study procedures and the BA-HD
treatment. Second, we will examine the preliminary efficacy of BA-HD to improve (1) depressed mood and (2)
cardiovascular health assessed via the American Heart Association’s Life’s Simple 7 Total Score. Findings
from the proposed research are necessary to finalize study design in preparation for a subsequent fully
powered trial to evaluate the efficacy of BA-HD to improve cardiovascular health and depression"
10798298,"ABSTRACT
Major histocompatibility loci (MHC) are the largest genetic contributors to autoimmune susceptibility, including
type 1 diabetes. Our novel observations show that biophysical parameters of T cell receptor interactions with
peptide-MHC are altered in the context of susceptible MHC alleles. Dissecting the interaction between T cell
receptor and self-antigens requires sensitive technologies to measure the affinity and bond lifetimes. T cells
apply force to the bond between TCR and pMHC antigenic complex, which is ultimately reflected by changes in
how long the proteins interact. We have surveyed affinities, bond lifetimes, and force that form during T cell
receptor interaction with model, infectious, and self-antigens presented on non-autoimmune I-Ab and compared
these observations with I-Ag7 autoimmune MHC restricted T cells. We consistently observed 2-fold difference
in force between effector and Foxp3+ regulatory T cells in non-autoimmune MHC restricted responses, with
Tregs pulling higher 20pN force. However, I-Ag7 restricted effector T cells are capable of pulling similar high
20pN force, and Tregs loose the 2-fold force advantage. Moreover, human-derived beta cell antigen specific
TCR restricted to autoimmune HLA-DR4 exhibited similar high 20pN force. Our overall hypothesis is that Foxp3+
Treg efficacy is dependent on peak TCR force levels that differ 2-fold from T conventional cells, this difference
is absent in the context of autoimmune MHCs. How structural components of autoimmune MHC, peptide, and
TCR control the stability of the TCR/pMHC interaction is not fully resolved, especially in the context of force
measurements. Our recently published and unpublished observations point to CDR2 loops of the TCR as
important in establishing the level of force. Moreover, it is unknown how susceptible MHC effects Treg
suppressive function, and why Tregs falter during T1D. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the beta cell-
specific reactivity of effector and regulatory T cells is needed to fully understand and potentially exploit their
therapeutic potential for treatment of autoimmune diabetes. We have devised two aims to test this hypothesis:
Aim 1. Determine TCR biophysical parameters restricted by autoimmune MHC and their impact on autoimmune
and regulatory T cell function; and Aim 2. Determine structural components of TCR that specifically regulate the
force and bond-lifetime, but do not influence specificity or affinity of the interaction. This project will be the first
to investigate various levels of force/bond lifetimes as indicators for T cell function and loss of Treg function in
autoimmunity, and connect TCR affinity vs force to the ultimate outcome in disease. Furthermore, it will provide
novel insight into the mechanisms governing dysfunction of T cell tolerance during T1D."
10817077,"How memory is stored in the brain is unknown. The dominant synaptic plasticity and memory (SPM)
hypothesis asserts that memory is stored by functional modifications induced by learning at a subset of the
synapses of the neurons that are activated to encode the learning experience. This predicts permanent
memory erasure is caused by post-learning inhibition of a molecular synaptic plasticity maintenence
mechanism that is necessary for persistent storage of the long-term memory. Indeed, erasure of a variety of
memories has been demonstrated by intracranial ZIP administration. ZIP inhibits the kinase activity of atypical
PKCs, PKMζ and PKCι/λ, both of which can be persistently upregulated following memory acquisition. PKMζ
is both necessary and sufficient for wildtype late-LTP maintenance, and when the PKMζ gene Prkcz is deleted,
PKCι/λ compensates for the loss of PKMζ, becoming necessary for maintaining late-LTP. Intracranial aPKC
manipulations erase a variety of long-term memories, but not all, providing crucial support for the foundational
SPM hypothesis. However, because the manipulations act generally, affecting cells that may not participate in
the memory storage, it is crucial to selectively depotentiate synapses in a memory-associated subset of cells to
critically test the SPM hypothesis. Indeed, others have used the fact that memory formation requires protein
synthesis to challenge the SPM hypothesis. They demonstrated that post-learning optogenetic stimulation of a
context-fear memory-activated subset of hippocampal neurons is sufficient to express the memory, even after
an amnesia-producing block of protein synthesis. However, these studies did not critically test the SPM
hypothesis because neither hippocampus function, nor the most common N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptor
(NMDAR)- and aPKC-dependent form of LTP in the hippocampus are necessary for context-fear memory,
amongst other experimental issues. We propose to critically test the SPM hypothesis using 1) a long-term
active place avoidance memory that is sufficient to induce persistent hippocampal synaptic potentiation, and
depends on hippocampus PKMζ, both for at least 30 days; 2) optogenetic activation of neurons that is
sufficient to express the avoidance memory; and 3) aPKC manipulations that are genetically targeted to the
memory-associated subset of cells. We will optogenetically activate a “sufficient-for-memory” subset of the
hippocampal neurons that are allocated to encode and recall a specific place memory, after erasing the
memory and associated synaptic plasticity by aPKC manipulation of the same cells. We will evaluate if after
erasure, optogenetic activation of the memory-associated cells expresses the spatial information in neural
discharge and the conditioned avoidance behavior that express the memory. If the optogenetic activation
causes memory expression, the SPM hypothesis will require modification, at least as far as it it concerns
aPKC-dependent synaptic plasticity and active place avoidance memory."
10809688,"Viral myocarditis is a heterogeneous disease that is difficult to study and diagnose. Because of the
heterogeneous nature of acute viral myocarditis and the difficulty and low diagnostic sensitivity of
endomyocardial biopsies (considered the gold standard for diagnosis of viral myocarditis), there is limited
knowledge of the molecular pathogenesis of this disease, particularly in infants and neonates where
endomyocardial biopsies are less often performed. The specific cells within the heart that respond to viral
infection, the nature of their responses, and the spatiotemporal distribution of such responses are not well known.
A better understanding of the spatiotemporal response of the heart to viral infection at the cellular and molecular
level will provide much needed insight into the pathological processes that drive the active inflammatory process
that ensues following viral infection of the heart.
The lack of understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of viral myocarditis is in part due to the lack of tools to
investigate viral infection in complex native tissues at single cell-resolution. Here we will use innovative spatially
resolved transcriptomics, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) tools and bioinformatics, in conjunction with
classical virology techniques, and mouse models to study myocarditis in mammalian orthoreovirus (REOV).
We have three aims: In Aim 1, we will study the viral and host factors that define the outcome of REOV infection
of cardiac tissues. In Aim 2, we will determine the role of pyroptosis in REOV-induced myocarditis. In Aim 3, we
will combine our high-resolution single-cell atlas of myocarditis with the principles of liquid biopsies based on
cell-free RNA to develop highly specific blood biomarkers of viral myocarditis, thereby addressing an urgent and
unmet medical need. We anticipate our studies will provide unprecedented insight into the pathobiology of viral
myocarditis. Our experiments will clarify which cell types are infected in complex cardiac tissues and will reveal
how infection success depends on both cell state and cellular environment. We will elucidate the role for
endothelial cells in viral myocarditis and we will explore whether and how immune cell responses switch from
host defense to host injury. We will explore the effects of infected cells on uninfected bystander cells in close
physical proximity, and we will map the cellular interactions that mediate this bystander effect. We will also
explore the spatial and cell type heterogeneity of innate immune responses within infected and uninfected
cardiac tissues.
Successful implementation of these studies will lead to new approaches and molecular tools to study viral
myocarditis and other viral diseases and may identify novel diagnostic approaches and therapeutic targets for
acute viral myocarditis."
10696662,"Suicidal behavior, which includes both suicide attempts and death by suicide, has become an ever-increasing
public health concern. Approximately 17 Veterans die by suicide every day (1), with rates highest among
younger Veterans (age 18-34). While relatively little is known about its biological basis, epidemiological
studies make it clear that suicidality has a substantial heritable component, with heritability estimates of 30-
50% (2). While there is evidence that this heritability is moderated in part by a liability to psychiatric disorders,
such as mood disorders, other evidence suggests heritable factors independent of psychiatric disorders (3). It
has been observed that the rates of suicidal behavior are particularly high in Veterans with a Serious Mental
Illness (SMI) when assessed using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS) (4). In the
Cooperative Studies Program (CSP) #572 study, Veterans with bipolar disorder (BPI) have a suicide attempt
rate of 55%, with women Veterans having the highest rate (5). This is compared to the rate of suicide attempt
in the Million Veteran Program (MVP) as a whole (3.4%) (6). Recently, the International Suicide Genetics
Consortium (ISGC) identified a genome-wide association signal on chromosome 7, which was independently
replicated by MVP investigators (7). We are now proposing to conduct a machine learning analysis of the
attempted suicide phenotype in BPI using the CSP#572 and MVP datasets. As with all machine learning
studies based on electronic health record (EHR) data, one critical issue is that the information on rates of BPI
diagnosis and suicidal behavior in the EHR dataset will be incomplete. To circumvent this and make our
subsequent machine learning algorithm more effective, we plan to incorporate and leverage the information
gained through the CSP#572 (5). Importantly, the ~5400 CSP#572 veterans with BPI were genotyped in
parallel with the MVP dataset (5,8) and thoroughly phenotyped using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM
Disorders (SCID; 9) clinical assessment and the gold standard Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale
(CSSRS; 4), generating a rich collection of relevant phenotypic data. This is a clear advantage for the machine
learning project as it gives us more reliable information on the presence or absence of bipolar disorder and
suicidal behavior on which to base our machine learning algorithm. In Aim 1, we propose an analysis utilizing
demographic variables and clinical comorbidities to screen BPI subjects from the CSP#572 and a matched set
of MVP controls for phenotypes relevant to suicidal behavior. Next, we will employ the Polygenic Risk Score
(PRS) approach, which can be used to identify individuals with increased genetic loading for various diseases.
Finally, we propose to generate predictive models of suicidal behavior using machine learning-based
approaches and the Aim 1 sample set. We will then test these results using an independent MVP cohort and in
the Utah suicide death replication sample. Public Health Significance: The proposed work has the potential to
greatly improve our ability to identify high-risk individuals. If successful, early detection of Veterans at greater
risk for suicidal behavior will allow for early intervention and lower suicide attempts and completions."
10843164,"Tissue culture inserts that utilize film-based microporous membrane scaffolds are key components of in vitro
tissue models that are used as alternatives to animal testing. However, insert scaffold technology has not
significantly advanced in nearly 30 years. Currently available film-based insert scaffolds are only 2-dimensional
(2D), and are excessively rigid compared to natural extracellular matrix. These 2D scaffolds are not well-suited
for production of complex in vitro 3-dimensional (3D) tissue models. Electrospinning technology can produce
novel scaffolds that better replicate natural 3D extracellular matrix and overcome limitations of currently available
scaffolds. In Phase I-equivalent preliminary work, we produced 3D electrospun scaffolds and developed
manufacturing processes for attaching these scaffolds to high-throughput screening (HTS) Transwell® tissue
culture inserts. We also demonstrated the feasibility of utilizing the 3D electrospun scaffold Transwell® products
for producing organotypic in vitro models of full-thickness human skin and bronchial tissues. These tissue models
have improved physiological relevance and functionality compared to currently available models, and are needed
as alternatives to animal testing. The goal of this revised Direct Phase II SBIR proposal is to further develop and
commercialize these novel electrospun scaffold inserts and organotypic culture models. Aim 1 will utilize 3D
electrospun scaffold inserts to develop full-thickness human skin models consisting of human keratinocytes and
human dermal fibroblasts. Aim 2 will utilize the 3D electrospun scaffold inserts to develop full-thickness human
bronchial airway models consisting of human bronchial epithelial cells and human pulmonary fibroblasts. The
tissue models will be produced in 24- and 96-well HTS Transwell® scaffold plates, as well as individual 6-, 12-
and 24-well Transwell® scaffold insert formats. The models will be produced without the use of animal-derived
extracellular matrix, and will be the only full-thickness in vitro skin and airway tissue models commercially
available as HTS 24- and 96-well formats. The tissue models will be characterized for barrier integrity,
morphological appearance and function, and intra- and inter-lot reproducibility. Validation of the models for
several regulatory accepted assays including assessment of skin irritation and phototoxicity, and assessment of
airway toxicity of tobacco products, will provide key opportunities for immediate commercial use of the scaffold
products and models. Commercial products that will result from this project include individual Transwell® scaffold
inserts as well as 24- and 96-well HTS Transwell® scaffold plates that will be marketed as stand-alone products
to allow researchers to produce any type of tissue models using their own cells and media. Tissue model kits for
producing human skin and bronchial models that would include HTS Transwell® electrospun scaffold plates
together with pre-qualified cells and culture medium and production protocols could also be offered through
partnerships. A conservative market penetration of 1% (global market for insert products, in vitro tissue models
and non-animal in vitro screening assays >$1.5 billion) would result in annual revenue exceeding $15 million."
10929970,"While American Indian (AI) Tribes and communities are highly diverse in ethnicity, language, and culture, there
is one unfortunate characteristic that they share: profound cancer health disparities. Compounded by
disproportionately low rates of cancer screening and more limited access to healthcare, AI are more often
diagnosed at later stages of disease and have the poorest outcomes in all types of cancer when compared to
any other racial and ethnic group in the United States. The cause of these significant cancer health disparities is
undoubtedly multifactorial. However, an unexplored factor is the molecular characterization of tumors arising in
AI. American Indians and Alaska Natives (AN) have been strikingly understudied in The Cancer Genome Atlas
Project (TCGA) and account for only < 0.5% of the cancer patients studied. Of the nearly 11,000 patients
sequenced in TCGA to date, only 27 (0.25%) were identified as AI/AN. It is our hypothesis that through
appropriate participant and community engagement and comprehensive genomic sequencing, we will discover
novel somatic and germline mutations, differences in the spectrum and/or frequency of cancer-promoting
mutations, and genome-wide mutational signatures reflective of behaviors and exposures, that can ultimately be
translated to improved cancer screening, precision prevention, and therapeutic intervention in American Indian
participants and communities. In this application, we will focus on the molecular characterization of cancers
which show significant disparities in AI of the Southwest, including gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary cancers
(stomach, colorectal, pancreatic, liver, gallbladder and biliary tree); genitourinary cancers (kidney, prostate
cancer); and other hormone-dependent cancers (breast, ovarian cancers). Our Specific Aims are to develop
culturally-appropriate, respectful, and trusted means to: 1) Engage American Indian participants (cancer patients
and survivors) and their Tribal communities in participatory research studies of the molecular characterization of
cancer, particularly focusing on cancers that display striking disparities in incidence and outcome in Southwest
Tribal Nations; 2) Discover novel somatic and germline mutations and/or differences in the spectrum and

Huntington’s disease (HD) is caused by expanded trinucleotide repeats (CAG) in exon 1 of the huntingtin (HTT)
gene. Therapies lowering the downstream mutant HTT protein show limited clinical success. New evidence
reveals that repeat tract length in the HTT locus, not mutant HTT protein, correlates to disease onset/severity.
CAG repeat length is inherited, but further expands due to somatic instability, which contributes to HD
progression. Modulating somatic expansion is a key path toward treating HD. Somatic expansion occurs in non-
dividing cells like neurons when DNA repeats misalign after transcription, forming a slipped loop that activates
mismatch repair (MMR). In MMR, nuclease complexes help recognize the slipped loop and cut the non-slipped
strand to create a gap that is filled to expand the repeat. Polymorphisms in MMR complexes are linked to HD
onset, and knocking out or altering activity of MMR proteins block expansion or induce contraction in HD models.
Yet, the contribution of each MMR protein to CAG expansion, and the effect of their conditional CNS-specific
reduction on HD outcomes, is untested. Also, mechanisms favoring contraction over expansion are unknown.
This project seeks to define MMR complexes facilitating HTT CAG expansion/contraction using divalent small
interfering RNA (siRNA)—which induce potent, CNS-specific silencing of target genes—and antisense
oligonucleotides (ASOs)—which can disrupt specific protein-nucleic acid binding in the CNS.
Aim 1 will use divalent siRNA to evaluate the effects of MMR silencing on HTT CAG repeat expansion and HD
progression. Efficacies of siRNAs targeting each MMR protein have been validated in human and mouse cells.
Furthermore, one of these siRNAs was delivered to CNS of an HD mouse model, BAC-CAG (carries human HTT
with 120 CAG that undergo expansion), showing target MMR silencing and blocked somatic expansion 2 months
later. In Aim 1, divalent siRNA targeting each MMR enzyme will be injected into BAC-CAG mice. Target silencing
and HTT CAG repeat expansion will be measured 2 months later. Top siRNA that block expansion will be re-
injected into BAC-CAG mice, and the impact on motor behavior, ventricular size, and HD pathology will be
explored over 9 months. Aim 2 will develop HTT CAG-targeting ASOs to induce MMR-mediated contraction in
HD cells and mice. An initial panel of ASOs targeting HTT CAG repeats was screened in non-transformed HD
patient-derived fibroblasts (HDpFs) using a high-throughput format, and ASOs that increase contraction events
were identified. To improve contraction rates, ASO chemistries and lengths will be optimized and screened in
HDpFs using the same assay. HTT CAG repeat length/instability will be quantified over 40 days to identify leads.
Leads will be delivered to HDpFs, in combination with validated siRNA targeting each MMR protein, to identify
MMR proteins mediating ASO-induced contraction events. In parallel, in vivo efficacy of leads will be confirmed
in BAC-CAG mice. This work will reveal somatic expansion/contraction mechanisms, inform HD therapy design,
and provide the fellow with crucial training in therapeutic development, neurobiology, and bioinformatics."
10912478,"Current modalities for preventing dental caries are insufficient, particularly when biofilms rapidly accumulate
under cariogenic conditions in susceptible individuals, requiring new approaches. In the previous funding period,
we studied the potential of catalytic (peroxidase mimics) iron oxide nanoparticles (IONP) for controlled, pH-
dependent activation of hydrogen peroxide as a novel antibiofilm and anticaries treatment. We found that IONP
displays selective-biofilm targeting and elimination under cariogenic (acidic and sugar-rich) conditions, while also
reducing apatitic demineralization. In vivo studies revealed that IONP are highly effective against caries
development without affecting oral tissues and the oral microbiome diversity, confirming therapeutic precision.
We also discovered that an FDA-approved IONP formulation, ferumoxytol (FerIONP), displays similar acid pH-
activated antibiofilm and anticaries mechanisms in vivo. In search for ways to improve efficacy and applicability
to enhance current modalities, we tested the possibility of combining FerIONP with fluoride. We unexpectedly
found a remarkable synergy between FerIONP and stannous fluoride (SnF2) that was exceptionally effective in
preventing caries in a severe rodent caries model. In this renewal, we propose to further develop this treatment
regimen, and then understand its mechanisms of action as well as potential deleterious effects using laboratory,
in vivo and human in situ models to facilitate clinical translation and product development.
The significance of this work is to develop a more effective and targeted antibiofilm and caries preventive
approach for susceptible populations. We hypothesize that FerIONP interacts with SnF2 to modulate both
biological and physicochemical properties by increasing localized antibiofilm action and protection against
enamel demineralization, potentiating anticaries efficacy without increasing the concentration of agents. We will
perform dose-response studies to improve the efficacy of FerIONP/SnF2 and assess local and systemic
biological actions in vivo (Aim 1). We will assess enhanced antibiofilm and caries preventive performance at low
doses without deleterious effects on oral-gut microbiome or toxicity on oral mucosal tissues and vital organs. We
will compare with previous FerIONP regimen (internal control) and currently used antimicrobial fluoride (SnF2).
Then, we will investigate the mechanisms of action and biodistribution of FerIONP-SnF2 (Aim2). We will generate
specific FerIONP analogues to understand biofilm targeting specificity and their combined effects with SnF2 on
enamel structure. We will perform multi-omics to assess the influence on biofilm composition and functional
activities as well as biodistribution of FerIONP via radiolabeling. The impact on enamel structure will be
determined via physical-chemistry and spectroscopic methods. In Aim 3, we will further elucidate the bioactivity
of the improved formulations using the human intra-oral biofilm model with a clinically relevant topical treatment
regimen. We envision a viable and novel technology to target virulent biofilms and prevent caries in susceptible
individuals under high cariogenic conditions that will motivate product development and clinical efficacy studies."
10930836,"PROJECT SUMMARY
TElomerase Reverse Transcriptase (TERT) is rate limiting in maintenance of telomere length by telomerase and
also has telomere independent functions such as regulating cell growth. We showed TERT promoter mutations
(mutTERT) occur in ~70% of Bladder Cancers (BC), most commonly at -146bp and −124bp which generate an
identical 11 bp sequence that is recognized by a common upstream signaling mechanism. These mutations drive
TERT overexpression, maintain BC growth and are associated with poor BC patient prognosis. These data led
us to develop a panel of innovative assays specifically designed to identify, through a chemical library screening
approach, small molecules that reduce TERT expression from mutTERT but not wtTERT. Discovery of such
compounds is a first step in attaining our overall goal of developing a drug that is selectively toxic for BC cells,
while having minimal toxicity on normal stem cells, which require TERT for self-renewal. Preliminary Data:
Using CRISPR, we constructed BC cells expressing HiBiT or EGFP reporters downstream of mutant or wt TERT
promoters. We validated these assays by showing that siRNA-mediated depletion of GABPA, a regulator of
mutant promoter expression, selectively reduced mutTERT as monitored by HiBiT or EGFP. We deployed our
mutTERT-HiBiT assay in an High-Throughput Screen (HTS) pilot screen of 605 kinase inhibitors and found 23
hits that reduced mutTERT-HiBiT. Among these were inhibitors to known drivers of TERT expression such as
Aurora Kinase A, as well as inhibitors that were mutTERT selective, all of which targeted mTOR. This data leads
us to the Hypothesis that small molecules that specifically suppress TERT expression driven by a mutant
promoter can be identified by a phenotypic screen. Three Specific Aims test this hypothesis. In Aim 1, an HTS
screen of a 350K chemical library will be conducted using a mutTERT-HiBiT reporter assay to identify
compounds that decrease TERT expression driven off the mutant promoter at 16hrs. Hits will then be confirmed,
and counter screened to remove those with unwanted activities. In Aim 2, priority hits will be purchased,
reconfirmed in the primary assay and their selectivity to effect mutant over wt TERT evaluated head to head
deploying EGFP reporter assays in BC cells and by allele-specific qPCR. An iterative analog-by-catalog (ABC)
approach will be used to establish nascent structure-activity relationship of hit scaffolds and improve potency
and selectivity. In Aim 3, the best hit from each scaffold that meet a set of rigorous potency and selectivity criteria
will be selected as a probe and characterized in multiple assays to map their activity on downstream effects of
TERT. These assays use a panel of BC and non-BC cell lines with and w/o TERT promoter mutations to
determine the probes’ effects on: 1) downstream TERT-related gene transcription via evaluation of our TERT
Expression Signature (TES); 2) telomere length quantitation; 3) Telomerase-dependent and independent TERT
functions including cell growth. Future Directions: We set the stage for novel drugs targeting cancer specific,
mutTERT driven, telomerase activity in patients with BC or other TERT-driven malignancies."

This R13 meetings grant application seeks partial support for three upcoming annual Alcohol and Immunology
Research Interest Group (AIRIG) meetings in conjunction with either the Midwest Autumn Immunology
Conference (AIC) in Chicago, IL, the Research Society on Alcoholism (RSA), the Society for Leukocyte Biology
(SLB), the Shock Society or Keystone Symposia. Funding is requested to cover travel costs and housing for
students, postdoctoral fellows, junior faculty, and minority scientists, as well as some of the costs for invited
speakers, for a one-day meeting which will cover broad aspects of alcohol and immunology. The 2023 AIRIG
meeting will be held at the University of Colorado Denver (UCDenver) Anschutz Medical Campus on Friday
December 8, 2023.The topic will be “Alcohol, Infection & Immunity.” This full-day AIRIG meeting will include 3
plenary sessions: 1) Alcohol, infection and host immunity, 2) Alcohol, inflammation and tissue damage, and 3)
Alcohol and the gut-brain axis, along with posters, short presentations selected from submitted abstracts and a
lunch time mentoring/educational workshop. We will hold the 2024 AIRIG meetings at Loyola University
Chicago (Loyola) and 2025 AIRIG meeting as a satellite in conjunction with the RSA meeting in New Orleans,
LA. Themes of the latter two meetings will be “Alcohol, Inflammation and Tissue Injury” and “Alcohol and Multi-
Organ System Responses.” The 2024 meeting will be held the day before the annual meeting of the AIC. The
AIC is a regional meeting with an impressive list of invited plenary speakers and ~440 registrants, while RSA
meetings are much larger, especially when held along with ISBRA. Holding the AIRIG meeting with AIC and
RSA will allow greater visibility of alcohol and immunology research. Additionally, these meetings have
numerous opportunities for young developing scientists to participate on many levels, including selecting a
large number of oral presentations selected from submitted abstracts. In addition, these meetings have Career
Development Programs, including sessions on Grant Writing. These sessions allow time for career building
and collaborative opportunities, which may not be feasible or readily available at other meetings. Thus, in
addition to providing a forum for the discussion of current research in the field, overall goals of the co-
organizers are to expand the participation of students, postdoctoral trainees, and minority scientists and to
increase the critical mass of scientists working on alcohol and immunology issues. We believe that these goals
will be best achieved by scheduling upcoming AIRIG meetings in conjunction with the AIC and RSA."

This project addresses the underlying mechanisms that progress ischemic damage of vulnerable tissue that
surround acute brain injuries such as stroke. Our long-term goal is to identify the specific mechanisms that
transition metabolically compromised tissue to damaged, pro-death penumbra and to develop clinically relevant
therapeutic targets to improve patient survival after brain injury. While understanding of ischemic methods of
neuronal injury has been the primary focus, exploring specific mechanisms of consequence and potential
therapeutic targets has lagged far behind. This project looks specifically at Spreading Depolarizations (SDs)
which have recently been identified as contributing significantly to the progression of injury in vulnerable
penumbra. The main focus of these events has been on their contribution to prolonged NMDA-mediated Ca2+
influx and subsequent damage. However, SDs present a much more complex and underexplored surge of pre-
synaptic cation release and post-synaptic uptake through alternate pathways. Specifically both post-synaptic
activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and increase in extracellular Zn2+ release and uptake have been linked
to the initiation and subsequent propagation of SD. Our central hypothesis is that SD-induced injury progression
in metabolically depleted tissue is mediated by dysregulation of non-NMDA-centric cation homeostasis.
Furthermore, agents that are selective to reduce alternative Ca2+ channel activation and/or decrease post-
synaptic Zn2+ uptake will reduce the downstream mediated damage that occurs following SD. We will use brain
slice and animal models to explore Zn2+ and Ca2+ specific mechanisms of injury as well as pharmacological
intervention to support compromised tissue during and after onset of SD. Specific Aim 1 focuses on the
hypothesis that neuronal voltage-gated Ca2+ channels contribute to post-synaptic uptake of intracellular Ca2+ and
lead to downstream cell execution. Neuronal Ca2+ loading will be assessed using a specific genetically modified
model and pharmacological intervention will be used to assess recovery in a metabolically compromised tissue
setting. Specific Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that disruption of Zn2+ homeostasis contributes to mechanisms of
SD-induced injury in vulnerable setting. Zn2+ wave in vulnerable tissue and specific stores of Zn2+ will be
assessed to explore where damaging levels are released. Specific Aim 3 then assess these mechanisms in an
in vivo setting. In all aims, both electrophysiological and imaging techniques will be used to assess specific
mechanisms in brain slice (Aim 1 and 2) and then translate into in vivo model (Aim 3). Pharmacological
intervention and specific knockdown models will explore where these cations contributions to damage and
identify where damaging levels of these cations originate. Completion of these aims should ascertain specific
mechanisms of Ca2+ and Zn2+-mediated injury following SD in vulnerable tissue and propose potential targets for
clinical prevention paradigms."

 2 The goal of this Ruth L. Kirschstein
 3 career. The applicant’s career development will come in large part from work in hepatic models of alcohol, high
 4 fat, and high sucrose exposure. The applicant will have the invaluable opportunity to conduct high quality
 5 research using a well-established preclinical macaque model of chronic binge alcohol (CBA) administration and
 6 an in vitro HepaRG spheroid cell culture model of hepatocytes. Alcohol-related liver injury is a leading cause of
 7 end-organ disease, and the combined impact of alcohol and a calorie-dense diet on liver pathophysiology has
 8 yet to be well characterized. Several studies of either alcohol- or high fat diet-related liver injuries demonstrate
9 that mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and remodeling (biogenesis and dynamics) are
10 decreased or disrupted in response to alcohol or high fat. Data from the laboratory showed CBA-mediated
11 decreased hepatic expression of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, OXPHOS, and fusion such as
12 peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-g coactivator-1b (PGC-1b) and mitofusin-2 (MFN2) in control diet-fed
13 macaques. Additionally, preliminary data generated for this proposal from liver biopsies of short-term high fat,
14 high sucrose (HFS) diet (HFSD) fed macaques showed increased expression of genes involved in lipid
15 accumulation. Previous work from the laboratory demonstrated that alcohol dysregulates mitochondrial
16 remodeling and bioenergetics in skeletal muscle and immune cells. Taken together, preliminary data and
17 published literature provide evidence of alcohol-mediated mitochondrial adaptations leading to end-organ injury.
18 Thus, the hypothesis of the proposed project is that alcohol and HFSD together disrupt mitochondrial remodeling,
19 decrease OXPHOS, and increase lipid accumulation in the liver, and that promoting PGC-1b expression
20 ameliorates these changes in hepatocytes. Using livers from CBA or vehicle administered HFSD-fed macaques
21 at multiple timepoints and an in vitro model of alcohol and HFS-treated hepatocytes, the applicant aims to test
22 that alcohol and HFS disrupt hepatic mitochondrial remodeling, decrease hepatic OXPHOS, and increase
23 hepatic lipid accumulation. Further, whether or not promoting hepatocyte PGC-1b expression will ameliorate
24 these alcohol and HFS-mediated alterations will be determined. Findings from the proposed studies will provide
25 insight into metabolic dysregulation caused by alcohol in the context of HFSD. Additionally, the project aims to
26 show that PGC-1b overexpression increases mitochondrial biogenesis, fusion, and OXPHOS and has the
27 potential to improve liver health in alcohol- and HFSD-induced liver injury. With a strong mentoring team
28 dedicated to developing a well-rounded physician scientist, completion of the proposed training plan in alcohol
29 abuse-related research will ensure that the applicant is equipped for a successful career in academic medicine.

Cancer is a disease of hyperproliferation, and tumor cells increase their metabolic output to support sustained
growth, which can lead to increased oxidative stress that damages macromolecules like lipids. Multiple pre-
clinical and clinical studies have now demonstrated that dietary antioxidants or common cancer mutations that
activate antioxidant pathways can promote tumor growth and metastasis, highlighting the importance of oxidative
homeostasis in tumorigenesis. However, whether oxidative stress accumulates to a point of cell death in tumors
and the in vivo mechanisms of such oxidative stress-dependent cell death remain elusive.
Accumulating evidence indicates that oxidative stress can lead to excessive lipid peroxidation of membrane-
associated fatty acids, resulting in membrane rupture and subsequently a non-apoptotic form of cell death,
termed ferroptosis. Many intracellular mechanisms have been found to regulate lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis,
and there is an emerging body of literature suggesting that cancer cells are highly susceptible to ferroptosis in
vitro. In addition, several conventional cancer therapies, such as chemotherapy and radiation, have been shown
to effectively eliminate cancer cells by promoting lipid peroxidation and inducing ferroptotic death. However,
despite the enthusiasm about ferroptosis and its therapeutic potential in cancer, there are major gaps in our
knowledge that will be addressed by this proposal:
 1) Does ferroptosis occur in tumors, and is it a barrier to tumorigenesis?
 2) Do common cancer mutations regulate oxidative metabolism to suppress ferroptosis?
Prior studies have been limited by lack of in vivo tractable models to study ferroptosis, but in this fellowship, we
propose a novel preclinical platform to investigate ferroptosis as a bottleneck during tumor progression that can
also be exploited therapeutically (Aim1). Building upon these in vivo models, we will also determine how specific
cancer mutations rewire metabolic programs to sustain tumor growth and whether overcoming ferroptosis is an
underlying mechanism driving disease progression (Aim2)."

Sepsis is an important cause of mortality, morbidity, and health care expenditures in immunocompetent
and immunosuppressed populations globally. Sepsis can lead to tissue injury, and eventually results in
tissue dysfunction and subsequent failure. Lower respiratory tract infections are a prominent inducer of
septicemia/sepsis (aka pneumonia-derived sepsis). Antibiotics are common treatments for these
infections. However, the use of these drugs will apply pressure on the bacterium to gain antibiotic
resistance. Therefore, there is a strong need for to broaden our knowledge and the development of new
methods of treatment. In this regard, vigorous recruitment of neutrophils to clear bacteria is a key innate
immune mechanism. Paradoxically, uncontrolled neutrophil leads to extensive tissue damage and organ
failure. In addition to membrane bound Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs), cytosolic NOD-like receptors (NLRs)
serve as critical molecules of innate immunity in pathological settings. Selective NLRs termed
“Inflammasomes” which are key receptors and/or sensors in innate immunity that induce inflammation in
response to invading pathogens. Among inflammasomes, NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3)
is the most studied and has been shown to play an important role during bacterial respiratory infections.
However, the role of NACHT, leucine-rich repeat (LRR), and PYD containing protein 10 (NLRP10) in
Gram-positive pneumonia remains to be delineated because this is a recently identified inflammasome
and does not have a leucine rich domain (LRR). Our lab preliminary data demonstrated that (1)
pneumonic human lungs show upregulated NLRP10 expression in macrophages, neutrophils, and
epithelial cells; (2) mouse lungs display upregulation of NLRP10 in myeloid and structural cells following
sepsis; and (3) NLRP10 knockout (KO) mice show reduced bacterial burden in the lungs and decreased
bacterial dissemination to extrapulmonary organs following Gram-positive infection. Taken together, this
preliminary data led to the hypothesis that the NLRP10 inflammasome is a central regulator of organ
damage in Gram-positive pneumonia-induced sepsis. Two related but independent aims have been
proposed: (1) To delineate the mechanisms by which NLRP10 inflammasome regulates pathogen
clearance during Gram-positive infection; and (2) To determine if ablation of NLRP10 inflammasome can
modulate alveolar macrophage, neutrophil, and alveolar type II epithelial cell function in Gram-positive
infection. The proposed studies will uncover mechanistic insights into the role of NLRP10 on pneumonia-
induced sepsis. The National Research Service Award will enable the PI to gain mentored research
training from a more experienced faculty along with an outstanding dissertation committee in order to
obtain an academic position."

Tumors are a heterogenous population of cancer cells, infiltrating host cells, secreted factors and extracellular
matrix proteins–together comprising the tumor microenvironment. The tumor microenvironment plays profound
roles in supporting tumor initiation, survival, progression and metastasis. We have discovered that tumor
endothelial cells provide an “instructive” signal to cancer cells that drives metastatic progression. We found Slit2,
an axon guidance molecule, to be upregulated in endothelial cells within metastatic tumors. Endothelial-specific
deletion of Slit2 strongly inhibited metastasis. In a surprising discovery, we found that endothelial-Slit2 deletion
also impairs tumor innervation. Nerves are only starting to be recognized as key players within the tumor stroma,
with recent evidence demonstrating their requirement for tumor initiation of gastric and prostate cancers. In
breast cancer, although there is some preliminary evidence that innervation correlates with tumor
aggressiveness, nerve dependence for metastasis has not been explored. In this Project, we will define the role
of neurons within the stroma of primary breast tumors and understand how neurons regulate metastasis. Using
isogenic cell lines of differential metastatic potential, retrograde tracing and imaging studies, we will first identify
neuronal sub-populations that regulate breast cancer metastasis. We will use 3D co-culture systems and in vivo
denervation experiments to identify the role of neurons in tumor invasion, proliferation, local and systemic
dissemination, distant seeding, and metastatic outgrowth. We will also evaluate the role of tumor innervation in
therapeutic resistance in breast cancer. Next, we will use unbiased sequencing approaches to define tumor-
trophic factors secreted by neurons and delineate downstream signaling axes in cancer cells. Finally, we will
characterize the role of endothelial cells in guiding neurons into metastatic tumors and determine if the pro-
metastatic effects of neurons are partly mediated by immune cells. The proposed inter-disciplinary research plan
combines molecular, genetic, biochemical, imaging and computational approaches to establish an integrated
model for neural regulation of metastatic progression by breast cancer. Collectively, these studies will define the
cellular and molecular interactions between endothelial cells, neurons, and immune cells within the tumor
microenvironment–an overarching goal of our proposed MetNet research center. These studies have
tremendous potential for impact as that they stand to identify novel therapeutic targets that perturb neural-tumoral
signaling axes driving metastasis."
10909179,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most deadly cancer in the United States, affecting over 140,000 people
each year, killing approximately 50,000 in the US, largely by metastatic progression. The intestine hosts the
body’s largest collection of immune cells, maintained in close proximity to foreign antigens from the diet, enriched
in the proximal regions, and microbiota, which accumulate in the distal regions. The vast and highly connected
gut lymphatic vessels form a major cell- and antigen transport route to the draining lymph nodes, responsible for
the initiation of adaptive immunity, which could play four roles in regulating colorectal cancer metastasis: immune
cells could (i) prevent CRC progression and early dissemination or metastasis by immune-cell killing (ii) promote
CRC progression and metastasis through release of inflammatory cytokines, (iii) prevent metastatic colonization
in the liver, or (iv) promote metastatic colonization in the liver. We provide data that compartmentalization of
intestinal lymphatic drainage to functionally distinct lymph nodes facilitates the simultaneous induction of
immune-suppressive and inflammatory immune responses in the gut; however, the relevance of gut lymphatics
to CRC and metastasis remains underexplored. In addition to compartmentalized lymphatic networks, the gut
also hosts a large number of enteric neurons functionally tuned to each region they occupy. Using retrograde
tracing from distinct intestinal regions and specific cell-sorting independent transcriptomics, we uncovered novel
neuronal circuits and a role for enteric neurons in sensing perturbations in the intestinal tissue; whether enteric
neurons sense and modulate CRC metastatic progression remains unknown. Overall, Project 2 is focused on
understanding how enteric-associated neurons sense and provide signals that regulate CRC progression and
liver dissemination and how compartmentalized intestinal lymphatic drainage of primary tumor and metastatic
liver sites regulate anti-tumor responses and early dissemination. In Aim 1, we hypothesize that primary CRC,
as well as liver metastasis, are specifically sensed by populations of enteric-associated neurons, which in turn,
influence tumor and metastatic progression. This question will be addressed using tools to visualize and circuit-
map, single cell and active translating transcriptomics, and chemogenetic approaches targeting specific neuronal
subsets. In Aim 2, we hypothesize that the intestinal lymphatic system communicates primary CRC and early
metastatic seeding to the local and systemic immune system, modulating anti-tumor responses. This will be
addressed combining modern clearing and live imaging techniques, single cell transcriptomics and novel immune
cell-interaction approaches. By combining these approaches, expertise of Mucida lab, with Sohail Tavazoie lab’s
expertise in cancer and metastasis biology (Project 1), the Birsoy lab’s expertise in in vitro screenings and cell
metabolism (Project 3), and the Cao and Saeed Tavazoie labs expertise in single-cell and bioinformatics
analyses, we seek to determine the role of neuro-lymphatic networks in CRC progression and metastatic
formation."
10909183,"Project Summary
Metabolic programs are particularly relevant during metastasis as it is an inefficient process comprising several
consecutive steps, with only a small proportion of circulating tumor cells generating a metastatic lesion. The
inefficiency is largely attributable to the host organ environments, which impose metabolic limitations on cancer
cells. Indeed, cancer cells are frequently starved for nutrients and oxygen in distant organ environments due to
poor vasculature. To endure unfavorable nutrient conditions during the metastatic cascade, disseminated tumor
cells require substantial metabolic rewiring that enables them to grow at the primary and metastatic sites.
Additionally, cancer cells metabolically interact with each other and with normal cell types or upregulate
alternative pathways to overcome these metabolic limitations in their environment. Integration of nutrient
availability from the local environment with metabolic adaptation signatures in cancer cells is key to
understanding how cancer cells interact with the surrounding cells and extracellular nutrients. Furthermore, as
re-population of cancer cells at a new organ site creates challenges for effective anti-tumor therapeutic
strategies, there is an unmet basic and clinical need to better understand the molecular interplay between the
metastatic site and tumor cells. Therefore, in this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that distant organ sites
impose metabolic restrictions that cancer cells need to overcome for metastatic colonization. To address this,
we will employ a comprehensive unbiased approach that combines multiple genetic, transcriptomic and
metabolomics techniques. These approaches will enable us to dissect the metabolic heterogeneity of cancer
cells and other cell types in distant organ sites. In the first aim, we will systematically map metabolic
dependencies of breast cancer cells during colonization of the lung and liver using CRISPR-based loss and gain
of function approaches. In our preliminary work, we have already identified potential candidates that are involved
in breast cancer metastasis to lung. In the second aim, we will investigate the role of niche cells by combining
cell-specific metabolomics and single-cell sequencing approaches in multiple metastasis models and in response
to therapy. The Birsoy lab has recently pioneered the use of metabolism focused CRISPR screens to study
multiple aspects of cellular metabolism in cancer models. The Cao and Saeed Tavazoie labs have expertise in
single cell transcriptomics and computational biology. By integrating gene expression profiles and metabolomic
information generated by this collaborative multidisciplinary effort, our work will provide entry points for identifying
pathways that may be activated or repressed during the course of metastatic colonization and in response to
therapy."

The Single-Cell Sequencing and Computational Biology Core B will be the central hub for devising and
implementing all Single-Cell Sequencing experiments, as well as the application of powerful computational
algorithms to such data as well as other bulk mRNA sequencing and metabolomic data to generate integrated
models of gene networks and regulatory factors underlying metastatic progression. All three Center Projects will
approach metastasis systematically, relying on the generation of transcriptomic, ribosomal profiling, single-cell
sequencing, proteomic, metabolomic and chromatic accessibility data. As such, this Center will rely heavily on
rigorous and statistically sound Computational Biology and Bioinformatics approaches pioneered by Saeed
Tavazoie, a leader in Systems Biology, who will be a co-leader of this Core. Similarly, all three Projects will
extensively employ Single-Cell Sequencing methods to define and characterize cell-cell interactions and cellular
gene expression states within metastatic tumors and to develop novel single-cell methods. Junyue Cao, a leader
in Single-Cell Sequencing technology development and application will be a co-leader of this Core. The
combined Systems-level focus of these investigators applied to the multi-layered data generated from distinct
stages of metastatic progression will enable the establishment of an unprecedented integrated Systems-level
model of breast and colorectal cancer metastasis—providing the framework for further mechanistic studies that
will refine this model, ultimately revealing critical nodes that when interrupted genetically or pharmacologically
will prevent and eradicate metastatic disease. Computational methods that will be foremost applied to the
problem of metastatic progression include:
1. iPAGE: an information-theoretic Pathway Analysis of Gene Expression algorithm that allows the systematic
 discovery of pathways that are differentially modulated across transcriptomes of any cell-types.
2. FIRE: an information-theoretic algorithm that identifies local DNA and RNA elements that underlie gene
 expression changes, uncovering associated transcription factors and RNA-binding proteins that govern such
programs.
3. TEISER: an algorithm that discovers RNA regulatory elements from transcriptomes, enabling identification
 of their trans-binding factors.
4. An algorithm that integrates transcriptomic and phenotypic features (such as survival) from large-scale
 cancer compendia to implicate critical clinically-associated genes."

induction of allergic lung inflammation compared to mice supplemented with dust from homes without pets.
Examination of ceca from mice supplemented dog-home dust identified a keystone species, Lactobacillus

of both allergic and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) induced lung inflammation. These reductions in lung
inflammation appear to be related to alterations in the functional activity of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells
(DC). Preliminary data suggests that microbial metabolites in the circulation of supplemented animals differ
from those of un-supplemented animals. Limited data suggests that the differences in circulating metabolites
are responsible for the alterations in DC function. Our rationale for including studies of RSV are epidemiologic
studies showing that RSV infections in human infants increase the risk of subsequent asthma. Our mouse
models mirror this relationship since neonatal infection with RSV leads to greater pathology when the mice are
sensitized to allergen 4 weeks later. Interestingly our preliminary studies have shown that supplementation of
female mice with L. johnsonii prior to mating reduces responses to allergen and RSV challenges in offspring to
a level similar to that observed in directly supplemented mice. Among the questions raised by this observation
was whether the effects of maternal supplementation on offspring occurred during in utero development or
post-partum from components of breast milk. This question led to cross-fostering experiments. In these
experiments offspring of supplemented or un-supplemented mice were nursed by either supplemented or un-
supplemented mothers revealing that breast feeding can partially protect pups of un-supplemented mothers
from RSV. Based on our findings we propose studies in this Project based on the hypothesis that the maternal
microbiota shapes the developing neonatal immune homeostatic mechanisms through alteration of the
offspring gut microbiota and related microbial metabolites which lead to differences in immune responsiveness
and the risk of pathogenic allergic responses. Our studies will continue to examine the mechanisms though
which microbial changes affect pathologic responses to allergens and RSV. These studies will include further
studies to differentiate in utero effects and breast milk effects on offspring. Finally, we will examine the effects
of supplementation with consortia of bacteria selected in Project 3 on the response of offspring to allergen and
RSV challenges. These studies will provide greater insight into the findings from the human studies in Projects
1 & 2, especially questions concerning when effective interventions might be most safely instituted."
10688206,"The gut microbiome accumulates bacterial diversity over the first several years of life, and plays a critical
role in immune development including immune tolerance via production of microbial-derived metabolites such
as short chain and polyunsaturated fatty acids. We and others have demonstrated that children who develop
allergic sensitization or asthma, exhibit consistent bacterial genera depletions and metabolic perturbations in
infancy. Relative to those at low-risk of disease development, the associated products of the perturbed, early
life high-risk gut microbiome induce expansion and activity of T-helper 2 cells and reduce the frequency of
regulatory T cells in vitro. Thus, the implication is that the very early-life gut microbiome, via microbial-derived
metabolites, shapes nascent immune function in a manner consistent with disease or health in childhood. Our
most recent studies indicate that the meconium microbiome of high-risk for asthma infants (with at least one
asthmatic parent) is distinct from that of low-risk neonates, and exhibits a significantly delayed bacterial
diversification trajectory over the first year of life, implicating differences in vertically transmitted foundational
gut microbes and subsequent gut microbiome and immune development. Thus, the human gut microbiome
appears to adhere to the tenets of primary succession, the process of species diversification in a pristine
ecosystem, central to which is the tenet that founder (or pioneer) species, (i.e. those that first colonize), shape
ecosystem conditions and thus the pace and trajectory of subsequent species accumulation. We thus
hypothesize that in those children protected against allergy and asthma development, specific early-life gut
microbiome strains, and more specifically, their metabolic products, promote immune tolerance which shapes
subsequent immune and microbial development throughout childhood protecting against disease development.
P3 aims to build upon our previous studies and address this hypothesis using both banked samples from
WHEALS for which 10-year allergic sensitization and asthma outcomes are known, and prospectively collected
longitudinal samples in this P01 from mother-infant dyads in children with a High Risk for Allergic Asthma
Phenotype (HiRAAP) or Low Risk for Allergic Asthma Phenotype (LoRAAP) at age 2 years. P3 proposes to
identify early-life gut microbial derived metabolites that promote immune functions associated with protection
against allergic asthma development in childhood, identify their microbial source, and develop and, based on
these findings, test a novel microbial polybiotic for its capacity to shape immune function and protect against
airway allergic sensitization in mice. This study will advance our knowledge of how gut microbial strains and
their products program protective immunity against childhood allergic asthma development, and serve as a
foundation for primary prevention of the disease."
10688209,"The health status of our children has long lasting social and economic ramifications for the nation. Asthma
is the most common chronic condition in the U.S. pediatric age group. This disease often carries on into
adulthood and is associated with lifelong deficits in lung function. The majority of these children are also
allergic, and a sub-group have asthma that is difficult to control. Despite substantial research effort, the
dramatic increase in asthma prevalence over the past decades has not been mitigated.
 New hope is centered on research investigating the influence and possible interventional opportunities
afforded by study of the gut microbiota. This has become possible with the advent of culture-independent
technology. Our initial P01 used our WHEALS birth cohort to demonstrate that numerous child and
also maternal characteristics were associated with the infant's gut microbiota community composition. Infant
gut microbiota characteristics, such as lower bacterial diversity and higher fungal diversity, were associated
with a multi-allergen-sensitized (IgE) phenotype at age 2 years and asthma at age 4 yrs. Our new data reveals
that this age 2yr phenotype is associated with a high risk of multi-sensitized allergic asthma at age 10 yrs, and
the same gut microbiota characteristics are associated with this higher risk. Our new P01 murine data supports
a maternal microbiota influence on the offspring's immune system.
 The WHEALS birth cohort was not initially designed to examine how the infant gut microbiota is related to
allergy, or the maternal contributions to this association. Infant stool samples were obtained using limited
institutional funds and therefore at only one or two points in time and relatively sporadically. This Project will
capitalize on a new, large and diverse health system-based general risk birth cohort with the focus of studying
the gut microbiota with the latest sample collection and analytic techniques and collection of stool specimens at
earlier and more frequent infant time points and one in late pregnancy. We propose detailed studies of multiple
variables likely to affect the maternal microbiota during pregnancy, how these effects are related to the child's
risk of allergic sensitization, and how the maternal and infant gut microbiotas can mediate risk. Project 1 is
designed to home in on maternal/infant exposures and gut microbiotas and how they associate with the child's
risk of becoming highly multi-sensitized or not sensitized (resilient to sensitization) by the age of 2 yrs.
Altogether, the coordinated Projects in this P01 are addressing hypotheses highly informative to future
development of potential microbial-related preventive interventions through both behavioral/social or direct
microbial means."
10688213,"The purpose of Core E is to provide high quality analyses of total and allergen specific IgE for Projects 1 and 2
from a laboratory appropriately certified for clinical IgE analyses, since results of each participant's analysis will
be shared with the participant. During the recruitment of women from the large cohort in Project 1 for
participation in Project 2 IgE analyses will need to be performed soon after the sample is obtained in a cost-
efficient manner. Since the Augusta University Pediatric Allergy-Immunology Laboratory performs clinical IgE
analyses on an almost daily basis there will be no difficulty with rapid reporting of the subject samples. An
accounting system will be set up to proportion the costs of reagents between clinical and research samples but
all analyses will be performed to the same high clinical standards. The laboratory maintains CLIA-certification
and participates in the quality assurance program of the College of American Pathologists (CAP) for IgE
testing. The laboratory has performed all IgE analyses for the WHEALS cohort and all IgE analyses for the
current program project P01 grant. The coefficients of variation for repeat assays are consistently in the range
of 6% or less. To assure data quality 1% of samples are reanalyzed weeks or months later and compared to
the original results. All samples sent from Henry Ford Health System for this research will be bar-coded as in
the past. This allows consistent tracking of samples during shipment and analysis. Sample bar codes are
scanned as samples are packed for shipment and the shipping list is sent via secure encrypted email. The
sample bar codes are immediately scanned and computer matched to the shipping list upon receipt in the
laboratory. The bar coding reveals no personal data so the laboratory is completely blinded to the name and
status of the subject who donated the sample. Data from the Pharmacia UniCAP instrument is sent directly to
the Biostatistics Core B at Henry Ford Health System using the same bar-coded identification number. This
system has worked well for the past 10 years. No samples have been lost during transfer and results are easily
uploaded into the study database for analyses. Dr. Ownby will oversee the performance of the IgE testing."
10688219,"The purpose of the Cohort Administration and Biospecimen Core (Core C) is to provide coordination of efforts
and staff to facilitate the recruitment, enrollment, retention and sampling of participants in the new cohort; to
process, track and store participant biospecimens; and, to deliver stool and swab samples to Dr. Lynch's
laboratory at UCSF (Core D) for microbiome analyses, plasma samples to Dr. Ownby's laboratory at Georgia
University (Core E) for IgE analysis and stool and breastmilk samples to the Mass Spectrometry Core at
Michigan State University (MSU) for lipid analysis for this renewal project `Microbiota and Allergic Asthma
Precision Prevention' (MAAP2). This Core facility currently acts as the central processing laboratory and
clearinghouse for all biological and environmental samples obtained from study participants in the initial P01, the
`Microbes, Allergy, Asthma & Pets' (MAAP) study. This Core facility also serves as a repository for long-term
storage of specimens (plasma, breast milk, stool, urine, DNA, RNA, dust) for use in ongoing and future studies.
This laboratory has substantial experience performing all the tasks that are proposed for this Core in the present
proposal. The Cohort Administration and Biospecimen core is essential to the overall goals of this PPG
application as it represents the management and monitoring arm for the new birth cohort, whose samples will
inform all four projects. Core C will be responsible for programming and coordinating technical aspects of
recruitment and retention that provide Project Coordination staff with direction in these efforts. Core C will direct
the programmatic aspects of participant recruitment and retention that Project 1 and Project 2 will implement. In
addition, all projects will rely on Core C to process, track, store and ship the stool, swab, breastmilk and plasma
samples. By centralizing cohort management activities, the Cohort Administration and Biospecimen Core will
provide efficiency, consistency, and reliability. The centralization of biospecimen handling will provide skilled
laboratory staff experienced in the sample processing protocols, eliminating duplication of effort. Core C will
retain the programming staff needed for monitoring recruitment and retention, and for biospecimen identification,
storage, and distribution. The Core is under the leadership of Kim Woodcroft, PhD, who has 15 years of
experience in directing the Molecular Epidemiology Research Laboratory at HFHS. Christine Joseph, PhD, will
also provide leadership in the recruitment and retention monitoring aspects of the Core. Dr. Joseph has over a
decade of experience in observational studies and clinical trials, and in recruitment and retention of research
participants."

Asthma Precision Prevention (MAAP2) P01 renewal application is to support the development and conduct of 
the four Projects and the four additional Cores. The expertise provided by Core B will aid all four Projects, 
allowing them to be efficiently and rigorously designed, conducted, monitored, and analyzed. Core B will also 
help ensure the timely and accurate acquisition and merging of data, and its dispersion to the various Projects, 
as well as maintaining data integrity for long term storage. Building upon a robust structure of Core B and 
integration with all of the Projects and Cores established during the initial funding period, the MAAP2 Core B 
Specific Aims are to: 1) continue to maintain and extend database infrastructure from the initial funding period 
to allow for efficient, accurate, and secure data storage and retrieval; 2) assure data integrity by scheduled 
review of data via checking distributions for unusual values (outliers), cross-checking groups of variables for 
internal consistency, and performing appropriate quality checks; 3) supply accurate, up-to-date, and well- 
documented files for analysis to the Projects; 4) perform the selection of study participants for the nested case- 
control study (Project 1), as well as samples based on maternal risk (Projects 2 and 3); 5) provide statistical 
methodological development and expertise on innovative statistical methods for designing and analyzing the 
various studies in MAAP2; 6) collaborate with investigators in the preparation of manuscripts and abstracts by 
performing and providing written summaries of analyses with interpretations to aid in inference; and 7) apply 
the highest standards of reproducible research by maintaining all analysis plans and using the most up-to-date 
methods for analysis code and data documentation for publication with manuscripts. 
 To address these Specific Aims, Core B will rely on and extend infrastructure and tools it has developed 
and implemented during the initial P01 funding period. This list includes: 1) robust database systems including 
the Lab Sample Tracking and Routing Website, which has resulted no misplaced or lost samples to date; 2) a 
regular schedule of collaborative meetings with all Projects and Cores to ensure that all investigators and Core 
members are kept up-to-date with data processing, sample selection, and analyses, as well as to discuss the 
development of abstracts and manuscripts; 3) automated quality checks of data and documentation of those 
checks; 4) an analysis request and history tracking system to provide the highest level of transparency to the 
scientific community. Over the previous five years, Core B members have also developed expertise in the 
analysis of microbiome data by keeping up-to-date with the methods in the literature. Core B members will 
continue to do so to provide the most cutting edge and rigorous methods of analysis for each of the studies."
10688224,"The central theme of this renewal P01 is to learn how the gut microbiota of newborn children could be
altered to reduce the risk of allergic asthma in later childhood. This will require extensive interactions among
epidemiological, environmental, immunologic and physiologic investigations of many potential influential
variables on the microbiota of mother and child and the interactions of these microbiota to influence the
developing immune system. These influences on early-life immune development likely contribute to the
subsequent risk of allergic asthma during childhood. This renewal P01's Administrative Core (Core A) will
again have the ultimate responsibility for assuring productivity and synergy among the four Projects and the
four other Cores. Core A, under the direction of the P01 Co-Program Directors Drs. Johnson and Ownby, is the
administrative umbrella responsible for optimizing scientific and operational output across this Program Project.
 As in the initial P01, the continuing focus of Core A will be to provide for P01 oversight and integration.
Core A will oversee 1) communication and collaboration among Projects, Cores, investigators, consultants,
research and administrative staff, the External Advisory Committee, and NIH; 2) the quality of methodology,
data and analyses; 3) research output, primarily through presentation and publication, to promote effective and
timely dissemination of findings; and 4) the optimization of scientific and operational synergy. The Core A staff
will organize routine and special meetings to present and discuss results and ideas emanating from Projects
and Cores, set scientific agendas for these meetings, and appoint and support a Publications Committee and
External Advisory Committee. This Core will be responsible for promoting operational synergism and
effectiveness through monitoring progress and coordination of operational and administrative facets of the P01.
The Core A Directors will regularly review research activities, monitor the productivity and efficiency of all
Projects and Cores, maintain documents, and coordinate IRB, CEAC and progress report submissions among
the participating institutions. Core A will oversee matters of personnel, purchasing and fiscal management
including working with NIH and grants personnel at the subcontracting institutions.
 This P01 is innovative in that it brings to bear expertise across multiple disciplines and institutions to
address a major childhood health problem, but it requires careful and attentive administrative approaches to
capitalize on this advantage while minimizing the attendant disadvantages of communication barriers
introduced by disciplinary jargon, specialized expertise, different scientific perspectives, and geographic
distance. While not without challenges, the Core A leaders and staff have benefited from the initial P01
experience and will assure processes are in place to once again optimize this P01 team's synergy and
productivity."
10900591,"Project Summary and Abstract
 Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are genetically engineered T lymphocytes designed to sense
antigens and mount an immune response. Though CAR T cells have received FDA approval for the treatment
of several hematologic malignancies, success in solid tumors is limited by a lack of specific antigens, the
immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, and treatment-limiting adverse effects such as on-target, off-tumor
toxicity and cytokine release syndrome. Though investigators report strategies for mitigating these limitations
such as biomaterials for reshaping the tumor microenvironment, and logic-gated CAR T cells to prevent non-
specific toxicity, no proposed strategy has overcome each of these barriers. To surmount these limitations, I
propose the use of a novel surgical mesh for implantation into the tumor resection cavity. This mesh will be used
in conjunction with a split CAR T cell called a zipCAR, which uses a detached adaptor protein (a “zipFv”) to
sense antigens. The mesh is composed of polymeric nanofibers with a matrix of chitosan deposited within the
pores. The mesh supplies the zipFv adaptor protein, cytokines (IL-15), and T cell stimulatory antibodies (α-
CD3/28). I hypothesize that the use of this surgical mesh will overcome the barriers to CAR T cell therapy
in solid tumors by: (1) opposing T cell anergy and promoting proliferation in the resection cavity, (2)
preventing antigen escape via encapsulation of zipFvs targeting multiple antigens, and (3) imparting
spatiotemporal control over CAR T cell activity. Aim 1 of this proposal demonstrates the proliferation
advantage of the mesh by monitoring CAR T cell proliferation in a murine model of HER2+ breast cancer. Aim 2
of this proposal demonstrates the efficacy and safety advantages of the meshes in a model of operative
debulking of ovarian cancer. To demonstrate prevention of antigen escape, ROR1- and HER2-deficient OVCAR3
cell lines will be created using CRISPR-Cas9 knockouts. In a murine model of antigen escape, these cells will
be used to demonstrate superior efficacy in mice treated with zipCAR T cells and meshes loaded with zipFvs
against both antigens. To demonstrate superior safety, meshes will be utilized in the same model of ovarian
cancer with mice that are irradiated to upregulate ROR1 expression in non-hematopoietic stem cells in the bone
marrow and spleen, allowing observation of on-target, off-tumor toxicity.
 This proposal builds around four key components of critical research and clinical skills to support my
development into an independent physician scientist: (1) an interdisciplinary research project focusing on
novel surgical biomaterials for enhancement of CAR T cell activity; (2) multi-disciplinary mentoring from Drs.
Grinstaff (biomaterials), Wong (immunotherapy); and, Colson (clinical medicine, animal models, and
immunology), (3) academic physician scientist training in research conduct and communication skills, (4)
commitment to an individual development plan (IDP) to guide my training goals."
10812436,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The goal of this proposal is to develop label-free microscopy and computational models to predict the efficiency
of generation and the quality of cardiomyocytes (CMs) differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem cells
(iPSCs) to improve human cardiovascular health. CMs generated from iPSCs are revolutionizing treatment of
heart disease through drug development, disease modeling, cardiac toxicity testing, and regenerative therapy.
Since iPSCs can generate autologous or hypoimmunogenic allogeneic, functional CMs, we focus on improving
two translational roadblocks facing stem cell manufacturing: predicting the efficiency of iPSC-CM differentiation
and assessing the extent of iPSC-CM maturation.
Efficient differentiation and maturation are bottlenecks for in vitro and in vivo applications of iPSC-CMs. Single
cell heterogeneity within and between batches has impeded the scale-up of CM manufacturing by increasing
cost and production times through failed batches. While significant efforts aim to improve iPSC-CMs maturity,
compared to adult CMs, iPSC-CMs remain functionally immature, reducing their predictive capacity in vitro and
resulting in arrhythmias when used as a cell-based therapy. To realize their research and clinical potential, new
single-cell process analytic technologies and models are needed to predict iPSC-CM differentiation efficiency
and maturation state. Predictive models provide early identification of failed batches to enable closed loop
processes to correct failing batches, resulting in a robust, streamlined process. Current methods to monitor CM
biomanufacturing focus on end-stage analytics, are low-throughput, labor-intensive, and destructive. New
technologies that can predict differentiation and rapidly identify maturation state at the single cell level are needed
to improve iPSC-CM biomanufacturing and advance health care applications of these cells.
Changes in cell metabolism provide attractive process analytic assays for iPSC-CM differentiation and
maturation. Previous studies, including our own, show that iPSC-CMs undergo dramatic metabolic changes early
in differentiation. Given these metabolic changes, we hypothesize that label-free autofluorescence microscopy
of metabolic co-enzymes combined with cell morphology can provide real-time early-stage prediction of the
efficiency of iPSC-CM differentiation and identify iPSC-CM maturation state during biomanufacturing. Our
preliminary data shows that NAD(P)H and FAD fluorescence intensities and lifetimes (optical metabolic imaging,
or OMI) can predict on differentiation day 1 the efficiency of iPSC-CM differentiation at day 12, and can monitor
changes in CM maturation over 3-months in a touch-free system. Here, we will build and validate this OMI
process analytic approach using iPSC-CMs and in vivo benchmarks to create classification models that are
robust and developmentally relevant, and seamlessly integrate these tools into the biomanufacturing workflow."
10861726,"Project Summary/Abstract
Auditory sensory hair cells transduce sound using a bundle of actin-filled cellular protrusions called stereocilia
which are coupled together by tip links, top connectors and side connectors, and fluid forces. Activity of
mechanoelectrical transduction (MET) channels, located near the tops of the shorter stereocilia, are modulated
by the differential motion of stereocilia as conveyed via the tip link connection. Thus, stereocilia motion regulates
the open probability of MET channels which drives communication of sound to the brain. The fundamental goal
of this proposal is to characterize the mechanical underpinnings of the stereociliary connections that shape the
force applied to MET channels. Many human deafness genes affect the molecular components of the MET
machinery, including tip links and MET channels. The biophysical characteristics of components coupling the
bundle dictate how they filter stimuli. Understanding the mechanical properties of coupling in mammalian hair
bundles is essential to our understanding of hair cell function and hearing (Aim 1, 2). We hypothesize that
channel open probability reflects tension in the tip link and that changes in hair bundle stiffness associated with
channel gating will be present in mammalian cochlear hair bundles. To test these hypotheses, hair bundle
mechanics will be investigated using newly developed technology that uses a ~1 µm diameter stiff probe to push
on 1-3 stereocilia which will displace the remaining stereocilia through the connections coupling them. High-
speed motion tracking will be used to reveal the rapid (<100 μs) movements of individual stereocilia in rows 1
and 2, allowing for characterization of stereociliary connectivity while whole cell voltage clamp provides the MET
current response. The MET machinery and its regulation by calcium will be examined by raising or lowering open
probability by changing intracellular free calcium levels, disrupting the tip link connections (Aim 1), and with
channel blockade (Aim 2). The experiments in this proposal, their analyses, and the dissemination of their
findings will serve as strong technical training for the applicant, providing the tools necessary to become an
internationally competitive, rigorous, and independent research scientist. Professional development will be
provided by experiences within the laboratory setting, the department, as well as by the environment and
resources provided by Stanford University. Technical and career development are provided through excellent
workshops, seminars, conferences, and collaborations with outstanding researchers inside and outside Stanford.
The research training plan outlined in this proposal is designed to create a pathway to independence where both
the technical expertise and foundational data will provide the cornerstone for independent work."
10914694,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Approximately 8.5 million high school and collegiate athletes engage annually in competitive sport. While
competitive sport offers many benefits, it also poses underappreciated risks to long-term health. Competitive
sport profoundly increases risk for injury (e.g., knee injury) and may position athletes for early onset of chronic
diseases (e.g., osteoarthritis), chronic pain, poor health-related quality of life, and disability. Preliminary
evidence indicates former athletes in mid-life (mean age 53) perform worse on functional tests than non-athlete
peers, but did not account for prior injury status. Quantifying function in former athletes with and without a prior
injury and non-athlete controls is therefore critical to informing targeted interventions and ultimately increasing
healthspans and quality of life. One modifiable factor that may explain the association between sports
participation and poor long-term health is physical activity (PA) patterns including prolonged sedentary
behavior (SB). Even among adults who meet recommended PA guidelines, SB is strongly associated with a
host of poor outcomes including chronic disease and all-cause mortality. Current male professional athletes
are substantially more sedentary outside their practice times than non-athletes, but whether this harmful
pattern of SB also exists in amateur (e.g., high school, collegiate) or female athletes or persists in former
athletes is unknown. The long-term research goal is to improve musculoskeletal, cardiometabolic, and general
health and function across the lifespan of male and female former athletes, emphasizing early behavioral
interventions that prevent this underrepresented and at-risk population from developing chronic diseases by
mid-life. The overarching hypothesis is that former athletes, especially those with a prior injury, will have poorer
function and health in mid-life and that current and former athletes will engage in greater overall and longer
bouts of SB compared to matched non-athletes. Using a cross-sectional design, Aim 1 will compare function,
strength, and cardiometabolic indicators among former athletes with and without prior knee injury and non-
athlete matched controls in mid-life (age 45-64). Hypothesis 1 is that former athletes with a prior injury will have
the poorest (1a) function (30-second chair stand, 6-minute walk, stair climb), (1b) quadriceps and hamstring
strength, and (1c) cardiometabolic indicators (body composition, cardiovascular disease risk). Aim 2 will
compare SB and PA patterns in current (age 18-25) and mid-life former athletes to matched non-athlete
controls. Hypothesis 2.1 is that current athletes will have greater SB, longer SB bouts, and higher levels of
moderate-to-vigorous PA. Hypothesis 2.2 is that former athletes in mid-life will have greater SB, longer SB
bouts, and lower PA levels. Identifying and ultimately intervening on risk factors for early chronic disease will
not only benefit many millions of male and female former athletes—a group in which minorities are increasingly
more represented than in the overall United States population—but also provide an efficient means to prevent
or delay chronic disease development in the population at large, a recent NIH emphasis (e.g., PA-18-849)."
10916304,"In this proposal, we will confirm of statins’ protective effects against knee OA progression statins in subjects with
non-traumatic generalized OA (GOA) with no/minimal subchondral bone marrow lesions (BMLs) as “potential
responders” and investigate the mechanism for statin protective effect on subchondral bone using dyslipidemia-
associated non-traumatic OA mice models. While there is no universal consensus on its definition, GOA is
commonly described as familial with polyarticular involvement and Heberden's nodes (HNs) in hand joints.
Epidemiologic studies have shown that dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis are more prevalent among non-
traumatic GOA (HN+) patients than non-OA subjects. Atherosclerosis may accelerate the GOA (HN+) through
the ischemic effect on subchondral bone. A high-fat diet can also lead to OA-related subchondral bone damage
both in humans and mice. Besides, OA-related bone marrow lesions (BMLs) detected by MRI are strongly
associated with dyslipidemia. Experimental studies using dyslipidemia mice models (e.g., Apolipoprotein E-
deficient (ApoE-/-) mice) have suggested a protective role for statins, first-line lipid-lowering drugs, on
subchondral bone. While experimental animal studies have demonstrated a DMOAD role for statins, the overall
observational clinical evidence for the protective effects of statins on OA outcomes have been inconsistent,
which could be due to: 1) perhaps most importantly, heterogeneous subject selection with regard to OA etiology
and baseline stage; 2) insufficient follow-up time; 3) use of only plain radiographs for OA progression rather than
MRI. Our recently published results showed that only subjects with the presence of HN as the hallmark of non-
traumatic GOA (HN+), but not HN– patients, show the lower hazard of radiographic OA progression compared
to statins nonusers. In our further preliminary analysis of semiquantitative MRI BML measurements, only non-
traumatic GOA (HN+) statin users with no/minimal BML demonstrated a lower risk of BML worsening at a 2-year
follow-up MRI. Based on these results, we hypothesize that statin use has a protective effect on subchondral
bone in non-traumatic GOA (HN+) subjects with no/minimal baseline BML, as “potential responders."" Using per-
protocol and incident user design and propensity score (PS) matching for potential confounding by indication
variables (OA and statin indications), a selected subset of OAI participants with non-traumatic GOA (HN+) with
no/minimal BMLs will be used. We further investigate the underlying mechanism in dyslipidemia-associated non-
traumatic OA mice models through inhibiting subchondral bone vascular defects and associated subchondral
bone marrow deformation. We will pursue the following aims: 1) Determine the association between statin use
and protection against MRI, serum, urine biomarkers of cartilage loss, and pain worsening in ""potential
responders."" 2) Examine the role of MRI-based OA-related subchondral bone changes as intermediary variables
for the protective effect of statins in “potential responders.” 3) Determine the mechanism for statin protective
effect on early subchondral bone change in dyslipidemia-associated early OA mice models."

10893508,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Immunotherapies hold immense promise to provide cures for many cancers and metastatic disease, but only
benefit a fraction of patients. Tumors can still engage multiple mechanisms to avoid and escape anti-tumor
immune responses, including suppression, inactivation, and exclusion of potential cytotoxic T cells, processes
which collaborate with cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). A better understanding of these barriers has
led to a multitude of new immunomodulatory targets to be developed, some to be used in combination with
e.g., checkpoint blockade or CAR T cells. On the other hand, dominant barriers to immunotherapy can be
different among patients with the same cancer type, and thus there is a need for personalized approaches to
immunotherapy, so that the appropriate targets are used. Here we develop a novel organotypic culture devices
to maintain ex vivo cultures of primary tumors and an immune component (tumor-draining lymph nodes or
circulating leukocytes), on a platform that enables precise control over spatial, molecular, cellular, and
mechanical characteristics and that is relatively high-throughput to allow screening or large numbers of
experimental variables. In preliminary data, we show that these devices mirror key features of in vivo
responses to immunotherapy, such as improved tumor cell killing and increased markers of immunotoxicity
(possible adverse events) in response to cytokine immunotherapy. We propose that these devices can be used
both to screen for ideal immunotherapy combinations as well as to probe the basic mechanisms underlying the
deficiencies in the anti-tumor immune response for tumors exhibiting varying levels of immune infiltration,
neoantigen load, and baseline lymphatic densities. In this way, we can begin to build a stratification map that
aligns key morphological features of individual tumors to treatment regimes that are most likely to lead to
efficacy and tumor regression. Using a combination of both murine mouse models and primary patient-derived
biospecimens, we will take advantage of the level of control afforded by our novel organotypic devices to
mechanistically interrogate individual immune cell subsets and signaling axes, towards understanding their
roles in influencing the course and outcomes of anti-tumor immune responses."

 7 selectively binds meth in blood and dramatically accelerates its removal from the body by clearance into the
 8 urine, representing a new approach to the reversal of drug effect: remove the cause and remove the effect.
 9 The indication for CS-1103 is to lower the level of methamphetamine in the human body. CS-1103 is
10 well-tolerated in rodent and canine and is highly effective in lowering the level of meth and rapidly reversing
11 its toxic effects in non-human primates. In our current U01 program (5U01DA053054-03), we have achieved
12 key milestones in current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) manufacturing, Good Laboratory Practice (GLP)
13 toxicology and pharmacology studies, and held a pre-Investigational New Drug Application (IND) meeting with
14 the FDA. The current U01 will conclude with completion of the Phase 1a First-in-Human clinical trial.
15 We propose here to further develop CS-1103 by completing Phase 1b and Phase 2a clinical trials. These significant
16 milestones on the path to FDA approval will be achieved via completion of the following Aims: Aim 1 will
17 optimize manufacturing process and produce drug substance and drug product under cGMP. We
18 will produce drug substance and drug product that meet FDA requirements and generate a CMC document.
19 Expected outcome is 100 kg of CS-1103 and 5000 vials of drug product. Aim 2 will demonstrate the safety
20 and tolerability of CS-1103 in the presence of methamphetamine in a Phase 1b clinical trial. The
21 Phase 1b trial is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled 2-period crossover clinical study to evaluate
22 safety, tolerability, and PK of CS-1103 following a single IV dose after an IV dose of meth in 10 individuals with
23 meth use disorder not seeking treatment. Expected outcome is that CS-1103 is safe, and we can obtain FDA
24 approval to proceed to Phase 2a. Aim 3 will determine dosing requirements for CS-1103 in a Phase
25 2a clinical trial. The Phase 2a trial is an open-label, placebo-controlled, dose range-finding clinical study to
26 evaluate efficacy and dose-response of CS-1103. Single IV dose of CS-1103 will be administered after an IV dose
27 of meth in 64 individuals with meth use disorder not seeking treatment. Objectives are to: 1) establish dose
28 response of CS-1103 to remove meth from the body by quantification of meth in plasma and urine, 2) evaluate
29 efficacy of CS-1103 vs. time after administration of meth, and 3) select CS-1103 dose for Phase 2b/Phase 3 trials.
30 Expected outcome is FDA approval to proceed to the pivotal Phase 2b/Phase 3 trials."
10925317,"Recent technological advances have revealed the existence of thousands of microproteins (<100 amino acids)
missing from genome annotations, but little is known about their function. The physiological relevance of this
‘biological dark matter’ is one of the biggest outstanding mysteries in modern biology. Compared to canonical
proteins, microproteins evolve at a strikingly fast pace. They frequently appear de novo and rapidly disappear
through disabling mutations, overwhelmingly exhibiting evolutionarily novel sequences found in only one
species or lineage. The lack of evolutionary conservation renders homology-based approaches for functional
prediction powerless and raises the concern that many microproteins might not be functional. The selective
pressures driving the rapid evolution of microproteins are largely unknown. In mammals, one of the most well-
characterized determinants of protein evolution is the immune system. Novel sequences are positively selected
when they mediate functional innovations that enable cells to mount effective innate immune responses to fast
evolving pathogens. Novel sequences are negatively selected when are recognized as foreign by the adaptive
immune system. We reasoned that the tremendous strength of these immune selective pressures is likely to
drive the rapid evolution of microproteins. We therefore propose that the immune system is a critical
determinant of microprotein function and evolution. We hypothesize that novel microproteins can only evolve to
perform cell-intrinsic functions if they are recognized as ‘self’, and thereby tolerated, by the adaptive immune
system. The lineage-specific sequences of these novel but tolerated microproteins would provide a vital
arsenal against rapidly evolving pathogens. Conversely, novel microproteins that are recognized as ‘non-self’
would induce auto-immune responses and rapidly disappear over evolutionary time.
 In this project, we will test the above hypotheses at a proteome-wide level using well established
cellular and animal model systems. We will combine: 1) Integrative ribosome profiling to generate a reference
microprotein expression atlas in mice; 2) T cell antigen discovery approaches and mouse models of
autoimmunity to assess the immunogenic potential of microproteins; 3) Genome-scale gain- and loss-of-
function genetic screens to determine cell-intrinsic, innate immune roles of microproteins; and 4)
Computational evolutionary genomics to reconstruct the evolutionary history, and estimate the strength of
selective pressures acting on microproteins. Our proposed work is centered on mouse models and murine
cells due to availability of specific genetic knock-out models and large quantities of matched tissues, plethora
of published transcriptome and translatome datasets, and ability to perform experiments in a controlled,
homogeneous setting with defined immune genetics. Together, these approaches will illuminate the
evolutionary and immunological principles that govern the large, but uncharacterized universe of microproteins
and identify microproteins with innate immune function or autoimmune potential."

 We propose to develop a monomeric DNA editing platform to eliminated mutant mtDNA (mitoARCUS).
In collaboration with Precision Biosciences, we will develop and characterize a new class of mitochondrial editing
enzymes that are smaller and simpler than TALENs, while still highly specific for the mutant mtDNA. This
platform is based on the I-CreI homing endonuclease, which was modified to work as a monomer, becoming
more amenable to viral packaging and delivery in a clinical setting. We plan to characterize mitoArcus for three
pathogenic mtDNA mutations, including: a) Human 4.9kbp Common deletion; b) Human MELAS tRNALeu(UUR)
m.3243G, d) the mouse tRNAAla m.5024T. Once the mitoArcus enzymes are characterized in established cell
lines, we will test their ability to change mtDNA heteroplasmy and restore function to clinically-relevant models.
These will include human motor neuron organoids ex vivo and and the mouse retina in vivo. Finally, we will test
a newly described base editing tool (DdCBE) in an in vivo model. This new base editor architecture (DdCBE),
specifically edit thymidines on mtDNA. This was possible, because this architecture is not based on the CRISPR,
thereby not requiring a gRNA component that cannot be easily imported into mitochondria. In collaboration
with David Liu's lab at Harvard/Broad, we will test whether mtDNA base editing works in a mouse model
harboring a pathogenic mtDNA mutation in the tRNAAla gene."

Recently, the use of culture independent techniques to characterize the microbiome has led to identification of
microbial signatures in the systemic circulation associated with lung cancer diagnosis and prognosis.
Consultants in this proposal have described how shotgun metagenomics, which identifies microbial DNA, can
be used to identify microbial signatures in plasma predictive of different cancers, including lung cancer. Our
preliminary data from our NYU EDRN archives show that metagenomic signatures can be predictive of early-
stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) compared to non-NSCLC. In this cohort, we have also identified
microbial and host transcriptomic signatures present in the lower airways associated with prognosis (recurrence).
These data support that microbial and host genomic signatures could be used to develop novel biomarkers in
early stages of this disease. Omic approaches can explore these signatures in an unbiased fashion, allowing for
identification of best performing features for predicting, in this case, NSCLC diagnosis and prognosis. In addition,
evaluation of the metabolomic environment can further uncover other potential biomarkers as it relates to the
metabolism of microbes and host. Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to utilize our NSCLC archives to evaluate
microbial metagenomic and host transcriptomic features paired with metabolomic approaches using blood
samples to develop novel biomarker signatures that predict early-stage NSCLC disease (Aim 1). We will then
evaluate the metagenome, metabolome and host transcriptomic data from lower airway samples from patients
with early-stage NSCLC to identify features predictive of lung cancer recurrence (Aim 2). Finally, using an
integrated multi-omic approach, we will optimize the selection of best performing features in Aim 3. The cohort
selected for these investigations will be divided in Discovery and Validation. Successful biomarkers will then
undergo external validation. The data generated here will serve as the foundation of an agnostic approach to
identify highly predictive biomarkers that will feed the development and validation for targeted approaches under
the Biomarkers Reference Laboratory (BRL)."

The ultimate goal of the NYU BCC EDRN is to develop Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)
grade assays that will allow for identification of early stage lung cancer and will predict the risk of recurrence
post-surgical removal of early stage disease. We already have promising data that this can be accomplished
through evaluation of microbial and host genomic signatures. These will be further investigated in the Biomarker
Developmental Laboratory (BDL) with agnostic omics approaches leading to identification of best performing
predictive features. The goal of the Biomarker Reference Laboratory (BRL) is to develop standardized,
analytically validated-biomarker assays that will target promising microbial and host signatures identified by the
BDL. In order to do so, we will have matching plasmas, buffy coats, and lower airway samples to the ones used
in the BDL for discovery as reference samples for “first order” clinical validation of our custom panels in the BRL.
In Aim 1, we will develop a targeted microbial genomic next generation sequencing (NGS) panel for blood and
lower airway samples predictive of diagnosis and prognosis of early-stage NSCLC. DNA probes will be designed
targeting taxa identified in the BDL. In Aim 2, we will evaluate whether a targeted metabolite panel using an LC-
MS approach in blood and lower airway samples can predict diagnosis and prognosis of early-stage NSCLC. In
Aim 3, we will test a custom-made NanoString panel for RNA from buffy coats and lower airways targeting best
performing features identified in the BDL. The cohort selected will be divided in Discovery and Validation.
Successful biomarkers will then undergo external validation. The proposed work will be performed in our CLIA
approved laboratory infrastructure. The pipelines developed here will provide a novel approach that can be
customized to multiple targets identified by others in the EDRN consortium. While each approach is distinctly
looking at microbial DNA, metabolites or host RNA target signatures, the consistent use of samples from a
defined group of subjects will allow us to estimate the role of combining different types of biomarkers measured
in parallel through different approaches for diagnostic and prognostic prediction. These investigations can then
lead to the development of a new multi-approach biomarker that will identify high risk subjects where more
aggressive interventions might be warranted."
10920366,"Per the 2020 US Census (data.census.gov), there are approximately 62 million Hispanic/Latino individuals living
in the US, and of these 15% are individuals aged 55 years and older 2. The US Census also projects that by
2030, this Hispanic population will increase to 74 million and by this time the number of older adults will
outnumber children. A separate but concerning statistic is that the WHO predicts a rising incidence of dementia
(78 million individuals by 2030) 3 and strokes (70 million survivors by 2030) 4 suggesting that there is an increased
urgency to provide clinical services for these populations. In order to do that, it is necessary to understand the
interaction between bilingualism (in Spanish-English speaking Hispanic individuals) and
neurological/neurodegenerative disorders. The problem is that bilingual speakers vary widely in how effectively
they process their two languages and how these processes may break down in neurological disorders. Thus, to
fully understand the nature of bilingual impairment (in stroke) and decline (in dementia), it would be necessary
to conduct prohibitively large-scale cross-sectional and longitudinal examinations of hundreds of bilingual
individuals with varying degrees of proficiency to accurately capture the variation in bilingual speakers.
Our central hypothesis is that computational simulations of bilingual language processing (in healthy aging),
language impairment and recovery (in stroke), and decline (in neurodegenerative disorders) is a powerful
approach in lieu of such studies. Computational modeling makes it possible to study an adult bilingual language
system that can vary by any language combination and proficiency at any single time point and characterize
change over time. BILEX, our computational model for bilingual language processing, has an already-proven
ability to simulate bilingual post-stroke aphasia (BPSA) and bilingual semantic dementia (BSD) as well as
rehabilitation outcomes for post-stroke individuals. Computational simulations can, thus, be used to effectively
represent not just known patient cases but also generalize to cases for which we do not yet have any patient
data. Consequently, our specific aims are to explain how different types of observed impairments in BPSA and
BSD arise. For that reason, we need to first characterize these impairments in more detail, and understand how
they may arise using a computational structure of maps and connections (Aim 1). Armed with such an
understanding, the second aim is to extend them over time, i.e. to explain how these mechanisms result in
recovery after a stroke (in aphasia) and decline (in dementia) (Aim 2). The third aim, then, is to understand how
these processes interact with language selection and control, by including subcortical conditional routing
mechanisms to our BILEX model (Aim 3). Each aim allows for progressively more detailed characterizations and
explanations of modeling impairment and recovery in bilingual post-stroke aphasia and decline in dementia.
These sophisticated and comprehensive mechanistic explanations for language impairment, recovery and
decline, and control and interference in bilingual adults with neurological disorders will pave the way for
treatments for these populations."

Huntington's Disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by progressive impairments of
motor and cognitive functions, leading to uncontrolled movements (chorea), dementia and reduced life
expectancy. An inherited mutation in the Huntington protein (Htt) underlies HD, leading to intracellular
accumulation and aggregation, with extensive neurodegeneration in the basal ganglia, specifically GABAergic
medium spiny neurons (MSNs). There are currently no treatments for HD. Recent studies have focused on the
role of astrocytes in HD. In particular, the inwardly-rectifying potassium channel Kir4.1 is downregulated in
striatal astrocytes of mice with HD, leading to hyperexcitability of MSN neurons. EEAT2 expression and
function are also impaired in HD mice. We hypothesize that a selective small molecule Kir4.1 activator could
enhance endogenous Kir4.1 activity, and potentially lead to a novel treatment for HD. To address this, we
propose to (1) identify new small molecule pharmacophores of Kir4.1 channels using an innovative approach
of virtual screening and unique modulatory sites in Kir4.1 channels, and (2) assess the effect of these small
molecule Kir4.1 pharmacophores on an astrocytic-neuronal function and HD mice. These experiments will
provide the foundation for new studies probing the role of Kir4.1 in HD."

This proposal is responsive to PAR-21-320 with two overarching goals: 1) to provide empiric training in
research methodology and hypothesis-driven research, and 2) to train a diverse cadre of clinical medical
toxicologists as independent researchers at the intersection of substance use disorder (SUD) and public
health. The epidemics of SUD are in sore need of innovation and diversity among researchers. Medical
Toxicology is a field of medicine dedicated to the evaluation and treatment of poisoned patients, including
adverse health effects of drugs and illicit substances. Medical toxicologists have a track record of innovation
and public health-relevant research in SUD; however, few pursue careers as independent, federally funded
investigators. In response to this gap in our specialty, we developed in collaboration with the American
College of Medical Toxicology, a hybrid research mentorship program, the ANTIDOTE (Advancing New
Toxicology Investigators in Drug abuse and Original Translational research Efforts) Institute. The ANTIDOTE
Institute provides structured research methodology training and mentorship to medical toxicologists with a
long-term goal of developing a pipeline of medical toxicology physician scientists that achieve independent
federal funding in SUD research. This R25 proposes to formalize ANTIDOTE by extending our curriculum for a
more rigorous training experience, providing seed funding to accelerate the progress of institute fellows in SUD
research, and expanding institute activities to include outreach and multi-generational mentorship. The
expanded two-year ANTIDOTE curriculum will be delivered using a hybrid approach including in-person
retreats, virtual group meetings/didactics, and virtual one-on-one meetings. We have assembled a strong multi-
disciplinary faculty who are experts in research methodology, innovators in the care of SUD, and master
educators. The Specific Aims of this proposal are: 1) To expand, implement and widely disseminate the
ANTIDOTE institute with a curriculum grounded in Participatory Learning Theory to support the development of
toxicologists as clinician scientists: 2) To evaluate the impact of the ANTIDOTE institute using a validated
program evaluation tools: and 3) To facilitate and sustain the development of a diverse investigator pipeline in
medical toxicology, through training in mentorship skills, knowledge translation and outreach. The ANTIODTE
Institute is the first program of its kind to systematically address educational gaps within medical toxicology
training around developing hypothesis-driven research investigations. Successful expansion of the program will
facilitate methodologically rigorous and clinically informed research on SUD and create a national network of
diverse investigators to sustain this momentum. This framework can then be translated outside of the field of
medical toxicology to facilitate pipeline development in other clinical specialties."

This proposal is a reapplication from the University of Texas Southwestern (UTSW) Medical Center to
participate as a clinical center in the Eunice Kennedy Shriver NICHD Neonatal Research Network (NRN).
Myra Wyckoff, MD became Principal Investigator (PI) in September 2013 and will remain as PI. Luc Brion,
MD and Roy Heyne, MD will continue to serve as Alternate PI and Follow-up PI, respectively. As an NRN
clinical center since 1986, UTSW has the necessary academic, research and clinical infrastructure to
assure continued rigor and reproducibility for NRN studies (Aim 1). UTSW Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine
(NPM) Faculty have broad experience in translational and multi-center, randomized clinical trials with the
NRN and other networks and will contribute to NRN concept proposals, studies, and publications. As an
international leader in newborn resuscitation science, Dr. Wyckoff will provide the NRN with expertise on
issues of perinatal transition, stabilization and resuscitation following birth. Other faculty will bring
expertise in Neuro-Neonatal Intensive Care and hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (Dr. Chalak), oxygen
use in the delivery room (Dr. Kapadia), placental effects on the fetus (Dr. Leon), gut microbiome (Dr.
Mirpuri), breast milk and nutritional elements (Dr. Brion), use of clinical informatics for research (Dr.
Lehman) and effects of perinatal interventions on metabolic syndrome and neurodevelopment (Dr.
Heyne). UTSW will work to support trials from a wider range of investigators both within UTSW but also
from investigators outside the core NRN centers (Aim 2) and to leverage resources for wider sharing of
data and biospecimens (Aim 3). The NPM Division has consistent strong support from the UTSW
Pediatric Department as well as its clinical facilities, Parkland Memorial Hospital (PMH), UTSW Clements
University Hospital (CUH) and Children’s Medical Center (CMC) of Dallas. PMH has one of the largest
inborn delivery services in the United States with ~12,000 births per year. CUH has a growing delivery
service with a significant focus on high risk pregnancies and a state-of-the art facility. The CMC NICU is
one of the largest referral units in the region and continues to expand its reach through telemedicine. The
Obstetric Department at UTSW has active referral and research programs across all clinical sites which
ensures that high-risk pregnant women deliver on our campus. The patient population at PMH and CUH
is predominantly under-represented minorities of Hispanic ethnicity and/or Black/African-Americans.
Their inclusion in clinical trials is essential to reduce frequent health disparities (Aim 4). A high percentage
of eligible infants at UTSW clinical sites are enrolled in randomized trials. Protocols are meticulously
followed and complete data is obtained. Follow-up of study infants is integrated within the infant’s primary
medical home at CMC, and follow-up rates are among the highest in the NRN. Thus, UTSW has much
to offer in support of the NRN."

 Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is important because it protects against cancers caused by HPV
infection. Nearly 79 million people are currently infected in the United States and about 14 million people
become infected with HPV each year. HPV infection can cause cancers in both women and men and the
financial burdens of these HPV-related diseases cost more than $8 billion per year in the US. The most
recently approved HPV vaccination can prevent up to 74% of HPV-associated invasive cancers. Thus, HPV
vaccination is one of the most profound opportunities in cancer prevention today. The Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends HPV vaccines through age 26. Among adults18–26 years, HPV
vaccination completion is unacceptably low whereas HPV infection rates are unacceptably high. There is also
a lack of interventions to improve HPV vaccination rates among young adults who were not vaccinated during
childhood. In the area of HPV vaccination uptake, males have disproportionately low rates and minorities have
lower rates of completing the vaccinations compared to non-Hispanic whites. This study aims to fill in the
important gaps by using a 2 by 3 factorial design to test the independent and combined effects of a multilevel
intervention: school-based HPV vaccine administration (no access vs. access) at the system level and web-
based narratives (no access vs. video vs. written) at the individual level.
 This intervention is developed based on pilot studies and socio-ecological models that recognize the
impact multiple levels of influence have on behaviors. The 2 by 3 factorial design results in six groups: )
standard CDC information about HPV vaccination (control); 2) video narratives about HPV vaccination; 3)
written narratives about HPV vaccination; 4) access to HPV vaccine at school combined with standard CDC
information, 5) access to HPV vaccine at school combined with video narratives, or 6) access to HPV vaccine
at school combined with written narratives . This design allows us to investigate the independent and combined
effects of tailored narratives and school-based vaccine access on HPV vaccination. College students aged 18-
26 who are not previously vaccinated against HPV will be randomly assigned to one of the six groups. Primary
outcomes are HPV vaccine initiation and completion at 3- and 9-month follow-ups, respectively. This study has
implications for creating a new paradigm in HPV vaccination by inspiring future new research directions that
include multiple levels of influence to improve HPV vaccinations. This study will make a significant positive
impact on public health, as it is using evidence-based strategies tailored for young adults aged 18-26 years to
promote “catch up” HPV vaccination. If successful, the web-based intervention can be easily disseminated
because it is brief and scalable. School-based HPV vaccinations can be implemented on college campuses in
the future to improve healthcare delivery. Success and lessons learned in this study will inform future
strategies to develop tailored narrative messages for different social groups."
10845548,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Approximately 1 in 3 women and 1 in 5 men over the age of 50 will suffer from a fragility fracture in their
remaining lifetime. Fragility hip fracture is one of the most serious and debilitating outcomes of osteoporosis with
a 20–40% mortality rate during the first year after the fracture. Hip fracture incidence rates are known to increase
exponentially with age in both women and men; and with the rising life expectancy throughout the globe, the
number of men and women who will be above the threshold of fragility fracture is expected to almost double,
with a prediction of 319 million cases by 2040. Thus, the number of fractures is predicted to double as well.
 In this Direct Phase II SBIR, BioSensics, in collaboration with orthopaedic, radiology, endocrinology and
biomechanics experts at Harvard Medical School, proposes to develop a cloud-based software solution for
automatic, opportunistic screening for hip fracture risk using plain X-ray images, called XFx. X-ray studies are
ubiquitous in all corners of the world, are inexpensive and provide high resolution studies that offer insight into
bone geometry, microstructure and density, at a low ionizing radiation dose. The proposed software solution will
include 1) a desktop application for uploading X-ray images and displaying and visualizing XFx results, and 2) a
secure cloud-based backend for receiving the uploaded X-ray images and performing the analysis. The software
architecture will support on-premise integration with a hospital cloud services (e.g., PACS systems) to enable
automatic, opportunistic screening for hip fracture risk using plain X-ray images. The solution will stand by in the
central imaging data server of hospitals or clinics, investigate each non-investigated X-ray image, and if
recognized to include a proximal femur, automatically execute the AI/ML-based classification scheme to identify
patients with osteoporosis or at high risk of hip fracture. If a patient is identified to have osteoporosis or a high
risk of fracture, the software will flag the patient. The clinician providing care for the patient will then be prompted
to consider ordering an evaluation of fragility fracture risk and receive a full report.
 This process is reimbursable under the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code 76499 “Unlisted
Diagnostic Radiographic Procedure.” This code is used when no other specific procedure code exists. The
existence of this CPT will support the initial marketing of the proposed solution. In Phase III, we will prepare an
application for a new Category III CPT code and submit if for consideration by the American Medical Association
(AMA) CPT Editorial Panel. Given the clinical need of the proposed solution, and recent approval of a CPT code
for radiology artificial intelligence (code 0691T) for automated analysis of existing imaging studies for vertebral
fracture and bone density assessment, our application for a new CPT code should not face any difficulties. In
the longer term, the proposed imaging analysis technology can be used for automatic analysis of thousands of
medical images that are taken every day in hospitals and clinics. This will enable detection of diseases and
conditions at early stages (e.g., bone metastasis and different tumors), thus facilitating preventive measures and
better care for those individuals at risk."

software program that has aided about 60,000 users in their modeling of
molecular processes in a wide range of disciplines, including biology, chemistry,

In this proposal, we seek to significantly reduce the computational time (now
around 500,000 CPU hours) required to obtain accurate free energy profiles of
enzymatic reactions. Specifically, we propose to use a multiple time step (MTS)
simulation method, where a low-level (and less accurate) quantum chemistry or
machine learning model is used to propagate the system (i.e. move all atoms) at
each time step (usually 0.5 or 1 fs), and then a high-level (i.e. more accurate and
expensive) quantum chemistry method is used to correct the force on the atoms
at longer time intervals. In this way, the simulation can be performed at the high-
level energy surface in a fraction of time, compared with simulations performed
only using the high-level quantum chemical method.
In the Phase I proposal, we successfully re-parameterized low-level quantum
chemistry models and developed machine learning models for MTS simulations.
Through these developments, we were able to extend the high-level force update
to only once every 8 fs or longer. In the Phase II period, we will further improve
and automate the workflow for developing the low-cost models, which will further
enhance the computational efficiency of our MTS simulations. In addition, these
advances will be combined by the EnzyDock method to facilitate the study of
multi-step enzyme reactions and the design of covalent/noncovalent inhibitors
and mutant enzymes.
The addition of these new tools will also further strengthen Q-Chem's position as
a global leader in the molecular modeling software market, making our program
the most efficient and reliable computational quantum chemistry package for
simulating large, complex chemical/biological systems."

In the context of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, cannabis use is an important topic and is the
most commonly used drug among people living with HIV (PWH), despite the success of combined antiretroviral
therapy (cART). Cannabis use is known to alleviate common symptoms and complications in PWH on cART,
including chronic pain, nausea, and anxiety/depression, but contradicting results have been reported for
cannabis use on cognitive performance. As cART does not cross the blood brain barrier the prevalence of mild
to moderate forms of cognitive impairments, known as HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND),
remain high (50%). Brain regions that are specifically vulnerable to HIV include the frontostriatal system,
involving deficits in learning, memory and reward-related behaviors. HIV-1 proteins released by HIV-1 infected
cells, including the transactivator of transcription (Tat) protein, are known to play a major role in the underlying
HAND neuropathology, including lasting changes in neuronal excitability, inflammatory processes, and synaptic
communication. Nevertheless, it is not clear how neuronal activity is altered by HIV Tat during learning while an
animal is performing a behavioral task, i.e in the context of reward. With the establishment of in vivo calcium
imaging, it has been shown that dorsomedial prefrontal cortex neurons that project to the nucleus accumbens
(PFC-NAc) increase their neuronal activity after successful appetitive discrimination learning. The goal of the
proposed study is to determine cannabis-induced changes on neuronal activity in a neuroHIV mouse model
during performance of a behavioral reward-related learning task and its relation to the endocannabinoid (eCB)
system. To achieve this goal, we will make use of a well-established mouse model of neuroHIV and propose two
aims. Aim 1 will determine how CBD:THC ratios alter prefrontal neuronal activity in HIV Tat transgenic male and
female mice performing a reward-related learning task. Animals will undergo viral injections to visualize in vivo
calcium activity in PFC-NAc neurons and drug administration starts with behavioral assessment. Head-fixed
mice will be trained to perform a Pavlovian conditioning task, that presents reward-predictive cues, and tests
animal’s ability to learn to discriminate between a conditioned stimulus that predicts sucrose reward (CS+) but
not the other (CS-). Neuronal activity will be recorded throughout training and compared before and after
learning. Aim 2 will determine the effect of different CBD:THC ratios (1:15, 1:1, 15:1) on the eCB system and
pathology in relation to appetitive discrimination learning in HIV Tat transgenic mice. Immunohistochemistry will
be used to assess cell-specific localization of cannabinoid-like receptors (CB1R, CB2R, GPR55) and catabolic
enzymes (FAAH, MAGL) on neurons, astrocytes, and microglia in the dorsomedial PFC and NAc; (non-)eCB
ligands (e.g. AEA, 2-AG, AA, OEA, PEA) will be quantified using ultraperformance liquid chromatography-
tandem mass spectrometry. This work will advance the understanding about how alterations in neuronal activity,
inflammation, and cannabis-induced changes in the eCB system contribute to HIV-related symptoms."

Approximately half of all sexual assaults involve alcohol consumption by the perpetrator, victim, or both. Self-
report surveys conducted with victims and perpetrators have provided valuable information about alcohol's role
in sexual assault; however, causality cannot be established from correlational designs. When participants are
randomly assigned to drink conditions in laboratory studies, causal conclusions can be made regarding the
effects of acute alcohol consumption on behavior. The major challenge for experimentalists is to develop
proxies for sexual assault that have strong construct validity and experimental realism. Virtual reality
environments (VRE) provide the opportunity for participants to become immersed in the simulated
environment; thus, participants are expected to behave in ways and to make choices that closely relate to their
behavior outside the laboratory. The goal of the proposed research is to build on the promising findings from
the PIs recent R21 grant (AA020876) that developed a dating simulation as a new experimental paradigm for
examining alcohol's role in acquaintance sexual assault perpetration committed by men against women. The
first specific aim of the proposed research involves enhancing the VR dating simulation based on insights from
our empirical findings and new technological developments. The updated simulation will be 3-dimensional, with
participants wearing head mounted displays that immerse them in the virtual world with their female
companion. Changes will be developed and evaluated in focus groups and cognitive interviews with male and
female participants to maximize ecological validity. The second specific aim involves systematically evaluating
the impact of situational cues manipulated within the virtual reality environment which are expected to evoke
the ""in the moment"" cognitions and feelings that are hypothesized to increase the likelihood of sexual
aggression among men predisposed to be sexually aggressive. The third specific aim involves examining the
effects of acute alcohol consumption on men's sexually aggressive responses in the virtual reality simulation.
Based on the findings from the studies associated with Specific Aim 2, situational factors will be manipulated
resulting in a 2 (alcohol condition: sober vs. intoxicated; target BrAC = .08) X 2 (high or low level of cue that
affects participants' perceptions of the woman's sexual interest) X 2 (high or low level of cue that affects
participants' sense of entitlement and anger after a refusal) design. Risk factors associated with sexual assault
perpetration will be assessed in a separate session and are expected to interact with alcohol and cue
conditions, such that intoxicated men who are predisposed to sexual aggression (e.g., high pre-existing levels
of hostile masculinity) and exposed to sexual interest and entitlement/anger cues are hypothesized to be most
likely to be sexually aggressive. Future studies can alter aspects of the simulation to increase generalizability
to different populations. The applicants’ long-term goal is to identify modifiable risk and protective factors that
can be used to develop evidence-based prevention and treatment interventions to reduce sexual violence."
10830932,"Stress is acutely beneficial for survival but can increase risk for chronic disease development across the
lifespan. Understanding the biological mechanisms that increase vulnerability to experience more stressors, or
react more negatively to them, can identify who is at risk for negative health outcomes associated with stress,
and assist targeted prevention and mitigation efforts aimed at improving well-being, increasing years of healthy
living, and decreasing healthcare burden through aging. A positive feedback loop, called the Immunologic
Model of Self-Regulatory Failure (Shields et al., 2017), provides one potential framework for studying biological
and physiological vulnerabilities to daily stress: increased physiological activation leads to neurological
dysfunction, which leads to subsequent self-regulatory deficits and increased experiences of future stressors,
and the cycle repeats. This model suggests that increased immune activation, dysregulation, or neurological
changes may increase vulnerability to stress by way of self-regulatory deficits. Cytomegalovirus (CMV), an
asymptomatic, latent herpesvirus is one such immunological factor that may increase vulnerability to stress
and its effects. CMV is associated with faster immune system aging and heightened systemic inflammatory
biomarkers in older age but may affect health, and increase vulnerability to stress, earlier in life. Importantly,
neurological regions affected by CMV coordinate higher-order psychological abilities, such as planning,
inhibiting, and regulating oneself, called self-regulation. In older adults, CMV seropositivity is associated with
declines in self-regulation, assessed via self-report, but this has yet to be tested in younger adults (Segerstrom
et al., 2022). Further, individuals with poor self-regulation may experience more stressors (e.g., relationship
problems, debt, etc.) and be more reactive to them (e.g., report a more intense, negative mood following a
stressor) compared to someone with better self-regulation. Though studies on self-regulation and stress, the
effects of CMV at older ages, and preliminary investigations on CMV and stress have been conducted, little is
known about biological mechanisms linking CMV, self-regulation, and daily stress in younger populations who
may still be able to modify or prevent CMV-related interference on daily life and future health. The proposed
project aims to fill these gaps by evaluating the relationships between CMV infection, daily stress, and self-
regulatory abilities. The research component of this proposal involves a single in-person laboratory visit for
questionnaires and dried blood spot collection and a 14-day daily diary to test (a) how CMV is related to daily
stress processes in early adulthood and (b) the mechanisms that may explain these associations. The training
component of this proposal includes (1) training, collection, and analysis of biological specimen, (2) primary
data collection from an undergraduate sample, (3) advanced training in statistical methodology and R
programming, (4) advanced training and expertise building in psychoneuroimmunology, and (5) extensive
professional development and ethics training in preparation of a competitive academic career."

There is a critical need for the development of new therapies for lung cancer, as current treatments are ineffective
and the five-year survival rate remains below 20%. The immune infiltrate in the lung tumor microenvironment is
a promising target for anti-cancer therapy. Macrophages make up the majority of this immune population and
exist on a dynamic spectrum which can either be anti-cancer or cancer-promoting. In developed tumors, a pro-
inflammatory phenotype in macrophages is beneficial for an anti-tumor immune response. To survive in this
inflammatory environment, macrophages rely on cytoprotective mechanisms regulated by the Nrf2 pathway. This
pathway serves as a defense mechanism against oxidative stress and protects normal, healthy cells from
malignant transformation. While constitutive Nrf2 activation in tumor cells can aid tumor cell survival, the effect
that Nrf2 activation has on immune cells in the tumor microenvironment is surprisingly underexplored. Synthetic
derivatives of oleanane triterpenoids are the most potent known pharmacological activators of the Nrf2 pathway,
and the triterpenoid CDDO-Methyl ester (CDDO-Me) has potent anti-tumor activity in a preclinical mouse model
of lung cancer. Tumor-educated bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) increase pro-inflammatory
markers associated with an anti-tumor immune response and decrease pro-tumor chemotactic and angiogenic
factors when treated with CDDO-Me. Therefore, I hypothesize that by inducing an anti-tumor macrophage
phenotype within the tumor microenvironment, Nrf2 activation will decrease lung tumor burden. Aim 1 of this
proposal will determine if Nrf2 activation in macrophages increases their anti-tumor function. Aim 2 will evaluate
whether Nrf2 activation in tumor cells polarizes tumor-associated macrophages to promote tumor growth and if
pharmacological Nrf2 activation in the microenvironment can overcome the effect of Nrf2 activation in mutated
tumor cells to reduce tumor burden. This proposal includes a comprehensive training plan including didactic and
experimental learning in both in vitro and in vivo model systems, transcriptomics, genome editing, and novel in
vivo imaging techniques. Completion of the proposed studies will provide me with the necessary skills and
rigorous training needed for success as an independent and collaborative investigator in cancer biology."

Many cancer survivors are at risk for cardiovascular complications after treatment. These complications can
include cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) such as diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity and
cardiovascular disease (CVD) such as heart failure, valvular heart disease, ischemic heart disease/myocardial
infarction, and stroke. Those diagnosed between 15 and 20 years old are considered adolescent and young
adult survivors (AYA) and frequently treated with cardiotoxic treatments which may increase their risk for CVRF
and CVD. Yet little research has focused on understanding CVRF and CVD incidence in this population. An
understanding of the incidence and time to onset of CVRF and CVD in this population is needed to inform
surveillance and health promotion interventions. Health promotion interventions, such as exercise, may protect
against the development of CVRF and CVD, because exercise has been shown to mitigate CVRF and CVD in
other populations. Yet an understanding of the relationships between CVRF, CVD and exercise is unclear among
this population. Utilizing data from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS), we will assess the incidence
and time to onset of CVRF and CVD as well as relationships between CVRF, CVD and exercise for those
diagnosed with cancer in the 15-to-20-year-old age group. We will identify if interventions, such as exercise, are
needed for this population and if the need is increased for those who receive cardiotoxic treatments. Guided by
the Cancer Survivor Research Framework, the study will address the following specific aims in 15-20 year old
AYA cancer survivors: 1) Compare the incidence and time to onset of CVRF between survivors who were
exposed and not exposed to cardiotoxic treatment and according to the type of cardiotoxic cancer treatments
(chemotherapy, radiation, or chemo + radiation) received, 2) Compare the incidence and time to onset of CVD
between survivors who were exposed and not exposed to cardiotoxic treatments and according to the type of
cardiotoxic cancer treatments received, and 3) Examine longitudinal associations between self-report exercise
(weekly metabolic equivalence tasks) and the incidence of CVRF and CVD in survivors across three time points
(1999, 2007, and 2014). The accompanying career development plan will provide training in a) the unique needs
and experiences of adult survivors of AYA cancers, b) the role exercise plays in mitigating CVRF and CVD for
cancer survivors, and c) longitudinal and secondary data analyses methods. Together, the career development
and research plan will support the development of an independent nurse scientist in cancer survivorship,
cardiotoxicity, and exercise. This proposal will generate important knowledge related to cardiovascular
complications for cancer survivors by creating risk stratification for receipt of cardiotoxic treatments. Additionally,
this research will increase understanding of the effects that exercise has on CVRF and CVD, laying the
foundation for future research focused on developing and testing interventions to mitigate CVRF and CVD among
cancer survivors diagnosed between 15-and-20-years of age."
10896928,"Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a chronic disorder characterized by the ability of drug-associated cues (triggers) to
persistently motivate drug-seeking behaviors, despite negative consequences. When drugs are associated with
cues, a strong conditioned memory is formed between the drug and the cues. Normally, once these cues no
longer predict a drug reward, this conditioned memory would be overpowered by an extinction memory.
Extinction memory recall (EMR) describes the ability to behaviorally express this extinction memory. EMR deficits
may underly the pathological drug seeking (relapse) seen in those with OUD. Importantly, a brain region involved
in each step of this process (conditioning, extinction and EMR) is the basolateral amygdala (BLA). OUD is also
characterized by distinct sex differences, with females being particularly susceptible to the rewarding effects of
opioids and more reactive to opioid-associated cues. Unfortunately, the lack of females in many prior research
studies on OUD has impaired our ability to describe the mechanisms behind, and thereby address, these
disparities. To resolve this knowledge gap, we conducted preliminary studies to investigate the role of estradiol
(E2) signaling in the BLA on heroin EMR in male and females rodents. In our first study, we found that blocking
E2 synthesis in the BLA during cued extinction training impairs EMR in both sexes. On follow-up, we found that
antagonizing estrogen receptor (ER) subtypes in the BLA led to sex-specific impacts on heroin EMR. Briefly,
females who received an ERβ antagonist had a profound EMR deficit relative to all other groups tested. In
agreement, ERβ agonism enhanced EMR in females only. The goal of this proposal is to evaluate the sex-
specific impacts of ERβ signaling in the BLA on heroin EMR. We hypothesize that modulation of ERβ
signaling in the BLA during extinction will alter EMR in females by changing neuronal function and
plasticity-associated mRNA expression, an effect driven by sex-specific ERβ expression in the BLA. We
will evaluate this hypothesis across 2 Aims. We propose to use pharmacologic and genetic approaches in males
and females to identify alterations in BLA activity and signaling following negative (Aim 1) or positive
(Aim 2) modulation of ERβ during cued extinction. Upon analysis, we expect that negative ERβ modulation
by antagonist or shRNA (Aim 1) will impair heroin EMR, decrease ERβ+ neuronal activity, and decrease
plasticity-associated mRNA expression in females. Contrastingly, positive modulation of ERβ by agonist or
overexpression (Aim 2) will have opposite impacts on these measures in females. The proposed studies may
better describe sex differences underlying heroin reward processing and OUD, allowing for more guided, sex-
specific interventions to successfully prevent and treat this disorder. This fellowship will support my training under
the mentorship of Drs. Carmela Reichel and Christopher Cowan. As outlined in this proposal, I will gain training
in (i) numerous technical and non-technical scientific skills, (ii) investigation of sex as a primary biological
variable, and (iii) consideration of biological and social determinants of mental health."
10898932,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Respiratory chemoreception is the mechanism by which the brain regulates breathing in response to changes
in CO2/H+. This mechanism is essential for maintaining breathing unconsciously and its disruption is
associated with breathing problems particularly during sleep. The lateral hypothalamus has long been
considered a chemoreceptor region; however, mechanisms underlying this function are poorly understood. As
LHA neurons show considerable genetic variability that may correlate with function, my central hypothesis is
that discrete subsets of LHA neurons are specialized to function as respiratory chemoreceptors. To test this, I
will use a novel genetic approach to label and identify CO2/H+ activated LHA neurons (Aim 1); identify intrinsic
and synaptic mechanisms contributing to LHA CO2/H+ sensitivity (Aim 2), and determine contributions of these
cells to baseline breathing and the ventilatory response to CO2 (Aim 3). Important outcomes of this work
include 1) determining the cellular and network basis for how the LHA contributes to the CO2/H+ dependent
breath, 2) inform about LHA functional heterogeneity, and 3) provide valuable training in molecular, cellular and
whole animal approaches that should make me well positioned for taking the next step towards my goal of
becoming an independent investigator."
10869912,"Project Summary / Abstract
Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPSNTs) are deadly, essentially incurable sarcomas that lack
effective therapies. Hallmark alterations driving MPNSTs are NF1 mutation, leading to Ras-MEK activation,
and loss of CDKN2A, leading to hyperactivation of CDK4/6. Our lab found that dual inhibition of MEK and
CDK4/6 (simplified as ‘CDK4/6 targeted therapy’ since both drugs downregulate CDK4/6) acts synergistically
to dramatically shrink de novo MPNSTs in immune competent mice. Tumor regression coincides with an
increase in intratumoral plasma cells (IPCs), which was not observed in vehicle control and drug-resistant
tumors. IPCs prognose better overall survival, increased formation of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS)
containing activated CD8+ T cells, and improved response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies in
many human cancers, including other sarcomas. I found that CDK4/6 targeted therapy sensitizes de novo
MPNSTs to ICB using Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibodies with the combination achieving
apparent cure in 10% of mice. These findings support my central hypothesis that CDK4/6 targeted therapy
causes tumor regression and enhanced response to ICB therapy through a plasma-cell dependent modulation
of tumor infiltrating immune cells. This will be tested through two complementary aims:
Aim 1: Define IPC associations with immune composition changes in MPNSTs caused by CDK4/6 targeted
 therapy with or without anti-PDL1 therapy.
Aim 2: Determine the mechanism and significance of IPCs in the MPNST immune response to CDK4/6
 targeted and/or anti-PDL1 therapy.
Proposed studies employ an established model of de novo MPNSTs generated by CRISPR editing of
Nf1+Cdkn2a in immune competent mice, closely mimicking the human disease. Changes in the immune
composition of MPNSTs following therapy will be determined through histopathological, flow cytometric,
cytokine/chemokine arrays and transcriptome analyses and results correlated with the antitumor efficacy of the
therapies. Through these aims, I will elucidate therapy-induced changes in IPCs and other tumor infiltrating
immune cells and determine if plasma cell loss reduces the antitumor efficacy of CDK4/6 targeted and/or ICB
therapy. Such experiments will, for the first time in any tumor type, establish the significance of therapy-
induced IPCs in the antitumor immune response. The role of IPCs in potentiating kinase inhibitor and ICB
therapies is of growing interest but so far remains untested; it will be defined here in the setting of MPNSTs.
Findings may guide new treatments for MPNSTs, including immunotherapy involving ICB agents, and have
broad applicability to other cancers."
10884359,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Infection with Chlamydia trachomatis is responsible for significant morbidity and healthcare costs
throughout the world. Work from our lab has demonstrated that T cells are a key mediator of immune
protection against C. trachomatis. Our long-term goal has been to gain an understanding of how CD8+ T cells
are stimulated in response to C. trachomatis infection. The reagents we have developed have allowed us to
use contemporary approaches in cellular immunology to define how Chlamydia-specific T cells respond to
infection. We have shown that transfer of cultured Chlamydia-specific CD8+ T cells into mice can protect
against infection, yet surprisingly, a protective CD8+ T cell memory response is not stimulated following natural
infection of mice or people. The apparent failure of the adaptive immune system to effectively clear the
organism and/or prevent repeat infection is a hallmark of human infection with C. trachomatis, resulting in
sequelae of infection such as permanent reproductive tract damage. Consistent with these findings in humans,
we have observed that CD8+ T cells respond extremely well to primary infection, yet the memory cells that
result from initial infection have impaired recall during subsequent encounters with the organism.
 Here, our goal is to 1) understand the mechanism by which CD8+ T memory is inhibited during infection
and develop methods to overcome it, and 2) identify vaccine formulations that stimulate protective CD8+ T cells
and test their capacity to enhance vaccine-mediated CD4+ T cell immunity. The vaccine strategies we will use
build on a successful experimental approach using nanoparticles encapsulating an adjuvant and bound to
whole inactivated organisms. Ultimately, we anticipate this work will drive selection of appropriate strategies
for vaccine development that provide robust protection against C. trachomatis."
10867344,"The HIV pandemic is increasingly driven by the spread of infection in vulnerable sub-populations with a relatively
high prevalence of substance abuse disorders (SUD), including the use of stimulants such as Methamphetamine
(Meth) and Cocaine (Coc). Stimulant use accelerates systemic disease, and can drive changes in
neuropathogenesis, increase risk neuropsychiatric comorbidities and accelerate cognitive decline, despite
effective ART. Despite the high prevalence of stimulant use among PLWH, the mechanisms by which stimulants
impact disease progression are poorly defined. This is particularly true in the CNS, as there are substantial
technical challenges involved in modeling microglial infection and interaction with neurons, as well as the
subsequent changes that this has on neuronal function. All stimulants increase CNS dopamine release, exposing
myeloid populations to highly elevated dopamine levels. Data indicate that it is the exposure to released
dopamine, rather than the stimulants themselves, which drives changes in microglial infection and function. Our
data support this, showing stimulant induced dopamine levels increase HIV entry and enhance myeloid
inflammation, increasing cytokine release, and NF-κB and NRLP3 inflammasome activity in vitro and in the NHP
CNS. Neuroinflammation driven by infected CNS myeloid populations is central to HIV neuropathogenesis in the
ART era, underlying the neuronal dysfunction and disruptions in neuroimmune communication that lead to
cognitive impairment and behavioral changes. We hypothesize that stimulant use exacerbates HIV-
associated microglial inflammation through dopamine receptor activation, leading to neuronal
dysfunction in neuroHIV. To address this, we propose to develop tractable, syngeneic co-cultures of human
iPSC-derived microglia (iMG) and iPSC-derived dopamine neurons (iDAN). Critically, these iDAN will release
dopamine in vitro in response to stimulant exposure. Co-cultures will be based on our existing protocols for iMG
and iDAN differentiation and will be developed and optimized for high-throughput analysis during the R61 phase.
During the R61, we will infect with HIV and treat with stimulants +/- ART, then use high content imaging, single
cell RNA-seq / ATAC-seq and Alphalisas to evaluate changes in viral dynamics (Aim 1b), gene expression and
chromatin accessibility (Aim 1c) and inflammation pathways (NF-κB, AP-1, STAT and NLRP3 activity, Aim 1d).
Using the R61 results as readouts, the R33 phase will use pharmacologic inhibition and CRISPR to identify the
specific dopamine receptors involved in each readout (Aim 2), and to examine neuronal function and
neuroimmune interaction (Aim 3) by evaluating; resting membrane potential and neuron firing rate with patch
clamp electrophysiology, dendritic spine density and morphology and microglial-neuronal contacts using
confocal imaging and Neurolucida360 analysis, and neuronal network activity using multielectrode arrays. This
will define specific dopamine receptors and microglial or neuronal functions that can be targeted to ameliorate
the impact of SUD on inflammation in PLWH by manipulating dopaminergic activity."
10914829,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) affects more than 10 million individuals worldwide each year and results in long-
term motor, cognitive, and affective deficits. Pharmacologic strategies are often used to treat TBI but to date no
therapy has successfully translated to the clinic, which advocates for other rehabilitative strategies to restore
neuronal networks and recover behavioral deficits thereby increasing the probability of bench-to-bedside
success. Neural stem cell (NSC) therapies may be a feasible alternative to pharmacotherapies for improving
function after TBI. NSC-based therapies can exploit their inherent ability to migrate to stimulate regeneration
and repair damaged brain tissue. In our pilot studies, well-characterized allogeneic human NSCs, LM-NSC008,
genetically modified to express the human L-Myc gene were intranasally (IN) administered to adult male and
female rats after cortical impact injury. LM-NSC008 cells migrated toward and distributed throughout damaged
brain tissue and into distant regions mediating behavioral changes. LM-NSC008 cells significantly improved
two distinct cognitive domains - spatial learning (reference learning) and executive function vs. vehicle (VEH).
Because clinical translation has been unsuccessful with single therapies, the NIH’s TBI and combination
therapy workshop recommended the evaluation of combination treatments. We have reported synergistic
benefits when environmental enrichment (EE) is combined with pharmacotherapies and predict augmented
benefits with LM-NSC008 cells as well. Our hypotheses are that IN LM-NSC008 cells in male and female rats
will 1) migrate and accumulate in sufficient quantities at proximal and distal TBI sites and contribute to
behavioral recovery, 2) provide benefit with a clinically relevant delayed administration approach, and 3)
improve recovery more robustly when combined with EE than when administered alone. To test our
hypotheses, optimize IN delivery doses of LM-NSC008 cells, and to determine LM-NSC008 cell fate and
mechanisms, alone and in combination with EE, the following Aims are proposed. Aim 1a: Determine the
optimal dose and delivery protocol of IN LM-NSC008 cells for maximal distribution to areas of damage at early,
delayed, and chronic time points after TBI. A single high dose of LM-NSC008 cells [6x106] or VEH will be given
IN on day-7 (acute period), day-21 (delayed), or day-90 (chronic) after moderate TBI or sham injury, while six
lower doses [1x106] will be given once on post-surgery days 7,9,11,13,15,17 (acute), 21,23,25,27,29,31
(delayed), or 90,92,94,96,98,100 (chronic) to determine the protocol that provides maximal distribution of cells
at the trauma sites at 3 timepoints after TBI and significantly improves recovery. Aim 1b: Evaluate motor,
cognitive, and affective behavioral improvements with IN LM-NSC008 cell therapy in TBI and sham rats. Aim 2:
Determine the effect of combining IN LM-NSC008 cell therapy with EE on motor, cognitive, and affective
behavior. Aim 3: Determine the fate, mechanisms, and regenerative capacity of IN administered LM-NSC008
cells alone or with EE after TBI."
10892129,"Project Summary
Every day we rely on our vision to judge the absolute distances of objects around us to plan and guide our
actions, such as walking and driving. This, wayfinding, process of ascertaining one’s position and planning for
possible routes of actions cannot be accomplished without reliable perception of visual space in the intermediate
distance range (~2-25m from the observer). Thus, the broad long-term objective of this project is to uncover the
mechanisms underlying intermediate distance space perception that supports distance judgment.
Yet, less is known about the underlying mechanisms of intermediate distance space perception compared to
those of near space perception (<2m). Moreover, extant knowledge is predominantly obtained from testing static
observers, making it difficult to generalize to the more common situation where observers plan and execute self-
motion. The latter situation is more complex because self-motion is accompanied by retinal image motion of
static objects in the surrounding environment, potentially requiring the visual system to simultaneously track the
locations of all objects in the environment. The visual system also requires more processing capacity because
it has to simultaneously compute the visual space representation, explore the environment, implement motor
controls, etc. Clearly, both challenges – coding complexity and capacity limitation – could pose as potential
threats to our ability to efficiently judge absolute distances and implement actions. We hypothesize the visual
system overcomes both challenges by: (a) spatially updating the moving observer’s position using an allocentric,
world-centered spatial coordinate system for representing visual space, and (b) use spatial working memory
(spatial-image) during spatial updating. We will investigate both hypotheses in three specific aims.
 Aim 1: Investigate the implementation of the allocentric, world-centered spatial coordinate system
 Aim 2: Investigate the factors affecting the spatial updating of visual space
 Aim 3: Investigate the role of spatial-image memory in visual space perception
Our psychophysical experiments will measure human behavioral responses in the real 3D environment. This
approach allows us to understand how our natural ecological niche, namely, the ground surface, both constrains
and supports space perception and action in the real world. We will test human observers’ ability to judge target
locations in impoverished visual environments under various conditions, such as while manipulating the
observers’ cognitive load (attention and memory), or available visual and idiothetic (vestibular and
proprioception) information, while they plan and/or execute self-motion (walking). The outcomes of this research
will advance the space perception literature, bridge theoretical knowledge of visual space perception and
memory-directed navigation (cognitive maps), as well as reveal the influence of vestibular and somatosensory
signals. In turn, the theoretical advancements provide insights for better understanding of intermediate distance
space perception related to eye and visual impairments and their impacts on mobility in the real 3D environment."

The global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has already claimed over 2 million lives and caused economic
and social disruption on an unprecedented scale. There is growing concern about long-term consequences of
the pandemic on physical and mental health outcomes of children, stemming from both the illness and from
associated disruptions in the economic, social, and healthcare domains. Our overall goal is to study
trajectories of child/adolescent mental health and primary healthcare utilization including immunization,
in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our project, located in India, will test key hypotheses about the
pandemic’s impact on health outcomes, vulnerability to future shocks, and sources of heterogeneity in these
relationships. A strategic innovation is to create a new health panel dataset - called the SurvEy of HeAlth
Trends (SEHAT), which means “health” in Hindi - by leveraging the world’s largest household panel data on
consumption and economic outcomes in India. The SEHAT data will be a new health module spanning 9 waves
from September 2021 – August 2024 to generate timely evidence on the pandemic’s impact on trajectories of
health outcomes. Our project on three COVID-related stressors: (1) disruptions in economic circumstances,
(2) disruptions in the social environment, or (3) exposure to severe COVID illness within family networks. We
estimate the association between these stressors and (a) mental health, and (b) rates of immunization and
primary healthcare utilization. Our second aim is to examine impact of COVID-related stressors on
vulnerability to future shocks. Using 9 waves of panel data over a three-year period, we will examine new
economic shocks, such as job or income losses in the household, and their cumulative effects on child health
outcomes. Our main hypothesis is that the negative impact of future shocks on child health outcomes will be
greater in magnitude among children in households that experienced higher levels of COVID-related stressors
compared with children from households with lower levels of these stressors. We will also leverage the large
amount of data to examine sources of heterogeneity in COVID impacts on child health outcomes, by factors such
as gender, caste, or household composition. Our third aim is to make SEHAT panel dataset publicly available
to facilitate research and inform policy. Our study aims to collect health data that can be transformative for
research and evidence-based policy. We plan to release descriptive statistics on key indicators immediately after
every wave, with accompanying policy briefs. After completion of SEHAT data collection in August 2024, we will
publicly release microdata by August 2026, prior to end of the grant period. We will also publish detailed
documentation to facilitate analysis using the SEHAT data."

Peru is rapidly increasing in stature in public health research, and many successful Peruvian-US research
teams have expanded research capacity through training grants based in major universities in Lima. Many of
these partnerships have satellite activities to study infectious diseases in Iquitos, the major city in the Peruvian
Amazon, but these research and capacity building activities have largely bypassed academic institutions in
Iquitos. This D43 training grant is specifically designed to address and correct this disparity, offering a
collaborative research training program in partnership with the Universidad Nacional de la Amazonia Peruana
(UNAP; National University of the Peruvian Amazon), the largest health education institution in the region. In
this renewal, our goal is to continue expanding the local workforce of highly trained professionals with public
health and infectious diseases research skills, which we propose to achieve by continuing the training of three
current trainees on towards the Doctoral Program in Public Health at UNAP and receive two incoming
specialist physicians trainees to complete a master’s degree in public health at UNAP. This intensive,
mentored training program with both north-south and south-south training components will be led by faculty
from four collaborating institutions (UNAP, University of Virginia, Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia [the
leading biomedical research university in Peru, located in Lima], Tulane University, and the University of
Arizona (UA)). The majority of the training will be conducted locally at UNAP through training modules and
online components. We will supplement the two-year MPH program at UNAP with complementary, short-term
training modules led by UVA, Tulane, UPCH, UA and USDA faculty that will be open to all MPH and doctoral
students in the UNAP program, expanding the impact of the training program to approximately 80 additional
master’s level trainees and 10 doctoral level trainees. Modules will be specifically focused on human subjects
training, rigor and reproducibility of research, scientific writing and grant writing, data management and
visualization, scientific communication and regulatory aspects of research in Peru and the US. Working closely
with UNAP faculty, we will integrate new program content into the existing MPH and Doctoral curriculum,
providing sustainable, ongoing benefits for future UNAP MPH and Doctoral classes. MPH and Doctoral
trainees will conclude their training by taking a leading role in writing and assembling a Fogarty International
Center Global Health Fellowship, while additionally, Doctoral level students will pursue a Prociencia Seed
Grant [entity of the Peruvian Counsel on Science, Technology, and Technological Innovation], the premier
scientific funding agency in Peru) under the direction of a mentoring team. We will continue to offer one-month
short courses during Years 2-5 for training community field workers and laboratory support staff will also be
offered, expanding the pool of research program support staff in Iquitos."

 Prolonged elevated levels of stress are comorbid with many neuropsychiatric illnesses such as major
depressive disorder (MDD), and can have devastating effects on individuals, their caretakers, and healthcare
professionals. MDD is typically demarcated as exhibiting emotions of sadness, significant loss of motivation,
and can be defined by social deficits. A growing literature indicates that major depressive disorder is influenced
by dysregulation in limbic brain regions including stress and reward circuitry. Despite a significant clinical
awareness, direct preclinical characterization of affective disorder circuitry and associated neuronal
mechanisms inclusive of sex as a biological variable are currently absent, and notably do not include social
decision making and motivation as behavioral metrics. Therefore, the aim of my proposal is to obtain the
necessary computational, behavioral and anatomical training to identify, interrogate, and manipulate neural
populations that modulate these complex social behaviors.
 This project will focus on identifying nucleus accumbens (NAc) circuit and cell type specific mechanisms
that regulate resiliency to operant social stress (OSS), and then further interrogate the afferent projections
driving these populations. OSS incorporates social decision making and social reward as metrics for social
stress resiliency. The choice of this brain region is based on converging preliminary data, implicating that the
NAc dopamine receptor (Drd) 1 and Drd2 medium spiny neurons (MSNs) confer opposing roles in regulating
resiliency to social stress. NAc circuit and cell-type specific activation will be identified using a combination of
whole brain clearing, Fos (a marker of neuronal activity) immunohistochemistry, and retrograde viral tracing.
Because of the limited temporal resolution of Fos during these behaviors, awake-behaving fiber photometry
recordings will be used to observe how NAc MSNs encode varying levels of susceptibility and resiliency to
OSS in real-time. Next, the causal significance of the NAc and its afferent projections will be examined using
region, circuit, and cell type specific optogenetic manipulations. Understanding the neural mechanisms driving
operant social stress in a sex-dependent manner will allow for the development of more specific and effective
treatments for affective mood disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD)."
10930957,"This proposal’s overall goal is to hasten drug development for children < 5 years with congenital muscular dystrophy secondary to laminin α2-related dystrophies (LAMA2-RD) mutations. Excellent mouse models of differing severity improved the understanding of pathogenesis in LAMA2-RD. Therapeutic strategies, including protein replacement and apoptosis inhibition (Phase 1), linker gene transfer, and compensatory gene upregulation (pre- clinical proof of concept), are all at various developmental stages but are expected to come to clinical trials in 2-3 years. While all these advances are promising, currently, no validated clinical outcome assessments (COA) are available for children with LAMA2-RD < 5 years. Thus, the need to validate outcome measures and biomarkers is urgent for children (< 5 years) with genetically confirmed LAMA2-RD. Successfully translating any therapy must include these youngest children for whom strength or function-based approaches designed for older “cooperative children” do not work. Clinical trial readiness for infants and young children is particularly critical since therapeutic interventions, if successful, are likely to have the best response when given early. The specific aims of our proposal are to 1) Validate motor function as COA for children with LAMA2-RD, 2) Establish minimal clinically important differences for motor COAs by anchoring them to the clinical global impressions scale, 3) Determine what cohort characteristics will best inform clinical trial eligibility, and 4) Validate novel biomarkers (cross-sectionally measure biceps and rectos femoris by ultrasound) and creatine kinase levels over time. To achieve these aims, we propose a 14-site multicenter prospective 2-year study of 44 children < 5 years at enrollment. Detailed training of at least two clinical evaluators from each collaborating site will take place at the lead institution, Nationwide Children’s Hospital, before enrollment and again in Year 3. We selected the sites based on their expertise in pediatric neuromuscular clinical trials. LAMA2-RD is ultra-rare, and these children are often medically fragile. Therefore, we also selected geographically diverse locations to minimize travel and burden of trial participation. A novel COA developed by necessity during the COVID-19 Pandemic is video assessments of all motor function COAs, further allowing less travel for children. Our partnerships with advocacy groups, including Cure CMD (Congenital Muscular Dystrophy) and the Muscular Dystrophy Association, will allow us to successfully recruit children using a spoke and hub model. The proposal will develop and validate COAs for children < 5 years with LAMA2-RD and will inform future clinical trial design and interpretation. Furthermore, once validated, these COAs are very likely to be successful for children with other rare disorders affecting motor development in early infancy."

Significance: Female sex workers (FSW) living with HIV are disproportionately marginalized and face a
myriad of barriers to sustained engagement in HIV care and viral suppression. In 2022, South Africa remains
the epicenter of HIV globally, and among FSW in the country, diverse experiences, vulnerabilities, and
treatment outcomes exist. Tailored, multifactorial implementation strategies to support HIV care and viral
suppression are needed for FSW whose needs are not being met, yet, it is not feasible nor effective to offer
everything to everyone.
Study Goal and Specific Aims: This study will provide a detailed understanding of when FSW engage with
implementation strategies to support HIV care and treatment, who engages, as well as how implementation
determinants influence outcomes, illuminating potential mechanisms for optimizing HIV treatment support
strategies. Specific Aims are to: 1) Identify patterns of engagement among FSW living with HIV and determine
their correlates and association with retention and viral suppression over time; 2) Explore how fidelity of
strategy implementation (i.e., strategy dose administered) impacts the relationship between strategy exposure
and clinical outcomes among FSW living with HIV; and 3) Characterize contextual factors influencing strategy
implementation and the effect on retention and viral suppression among FSW living with HIV.
Approach: This study will leverage existing quantitative, qualitative, and implementation data and
infrastructure of the Siyaphambili trial. The Siyaphambili study employed a sequential multiple assignment
randomized trial to test two implementation strategies among a cohort of 777 non-virally suppressed FSW
living with HIV over an 18-month follow-up period. The proposed study utilizes group-based trajectory modeling
to identify distinct trajectories of longitudinal FSW engagement (Aim 1), a component path analysis to explore
the role of programmatic implementation fidelity (Aim 2), and a moderator analysis to characterize
implementation determinants, interpreted and contextualized through in-depth interviews (Aim 3). All proposed
Aims represent novel analyses of existing, cleaned data collected from the Siyaphambili study.
Fellowship information: The proposed research is the doctoral dissertation of Ms. Carly Comins. The training
plan consists of selected coursework, tailored ongoing mentorship, and professional development to foster the
successful completion of the proposed research and to prepare Ms. Comins to become an independent HIV
epidemiologist and implementation scientist supporting HIV-related implementation research for key
populations. The proposed study directly aligns with the NIMH’s goals and the priorities of the Division of AIDS
Research, including leveraging pragmatic effectiveness-implementation research to enhance understanding of
the real-world impact of evidence-based interventions; improving methods to match interventions to
marginalized populations; and optimizing the delivery and reach of interventions among those at greatest need."

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. Sprouty2
(Spry2) is an endogenous suppressor of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)/Ras/Mitogen Activated Protein
Kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways.
The objectives of this study are:
1. To assess requirement of Spry2 in CRC mouse models.
2. To generate and analyze multi-omics data set from mouse tumors and patient organoids.
3. To assess whether differential 5mC and 5hmC hotspot loci in Spry2 may contain acquired differentially
 methylated/hydroxymethlyated CpGs that can distinguish between adenomas, adenocarcinomas, and
 adjacent control mucosa.
4. Furthermore, increased Spry2 mRNA expression and differential promoter methylation within regions
 susceptible to 5mC changes associated with Spry2 expression may correlate with worse prognosis in
 advanced rectal cancer patients undergoing preoperative chemoradiotherapy (PCRT) and surgery.
 Therefore, Spry2 expression and promoter 5mC status together could serve as prognostic epimarkers
 in advanced rectal cancer patients.
5. As Spry2 is regulated in CRC by DNA-methylation within the promoter and can therefore be modulated
 by CRISPR-dCas9 tool to affect overall Spry2 expression and tumor growth, it could be considered as
 a future treatment strategy in patients.
In previous studies, Spry2 accentuates cancer phenotype in CRC. It is hypothesized that deletion of Spry2
would suppress tumorigenesis in intestinal specific mouse models. To test this hypothesis, in Aim 1a,
Sprouty2flox/flox-Cdx2-P-Cre-ERT2, and Sprouty2flox/flox-Cdx2-P-Cre-ERT2/KrasLSL-G12D double mutant mouse
models are established and effect of Spry2 deletion on azoxymethane-induced colonic tumorigenesis is
studied. Further, Spry2 deletion in mouse models is complemented with shRNA mediated suppression of
Spry2 in Kras wild-type and KrasG12D mutant organoids established from adenomas of CRC patients (Aim
1b). Studies are extended to generate multi-omics dataset from mouse adenomas and patients’ organoids
using omics methodologies to assess signaling pathways regulated by Spry2 (Aim 1c).
Perturbing epigenetic regulation of Spry2 in patients could modify disease progression. In Aim 2a, we will
identify differentially methylated 5mC and 5hmC hotspot regions of Spry2 in CRC patients to distinguish
between adenomas, adenocarcinomas, and adjacent control mucosa. In Aim 2b, we will assess Spry2
mRNA expression and promoter methylation status in pathology collection of patients who had undergone
PCRT followed by surgery (a retrospective study) to differentiate between PCRT responders vs non-
responders by comparing disease free survival. Studies will be extended to test whether 5mC is an
epigenetic target using CRISPR-dCas9 editing in CRC. In Aim 2c, by utilizing different CRC cell lines and
immunocompromised mice, we will dissect the relationship between Spry2 methylation levels in the
promoter region with Spry2 expression and tumor growth.
The proposed study is a multi-pronged strategy to evaluate clinical significance of Spry2 in CRC."

Lower grade (World Health Organization (WHO) grade II/III) glioma (LGG), a malignant tumor of the brain, is a
uniformly fatal disease of young adults. The optimal clinical management for LGG remains unknown. A
comprehensive genomic characterization of the evolution from primary LGG to recurrence is required
to begin to address the LGG knowledge gap; optimizing the engagement of LGG patients in this effort
is critical to the success of this process. Using our International Low Grade Glioma Registry as a starting
point, we will construct a community of 700 LGG patients who have undergone surgical resection at time of
diagnosis and at time of recurrence and want to participate in research. We will use both hospital-based as
well as web- and social media-based patient engagement efforts and adapt pre-existing resources developed
at Yale including HUGO PHR, a secure cloud-based personal health record platform that allows secure and
permission-based movement of data bi-directionally between patients and researchers and ARCHETYP, a
Yale-developed software that assists patients in the location of clinical trials. We hypothesize that LGG
patient engagement and satisfaction (and thus overall participation) in genomic characterization
studies will be improved by 1) the ability to obtain and share medical record data with researchers, 2)
the availability of bi-directional communication between study and patients regarding study focus,
progress, outcomes as well as patient specific results, 3) improved messaging and education
regarding study and patient goals with respect to genomic characterization of patient materials. We
also propose that the knowledge gained in this application will provide a significant improvement in
the care of LGG patients."
10848351,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
In response to PAR-20-237, “community interventions to address the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic
among health disparity and vulnerable populations,” we propose to study a parent-focused mentalizing
intervention with a smartphone health platform in vulnerable populations in the Bronx. The Bronx—the poorest
borough in New York City (NYC) with 84% of its population comprised of minorities—has been hit
disproportionally by the COVID-19 pandemic. For caregivers in the Bronx, the pandemic has caused
unprecedented psychological distress; in addition to combating social determinants of health (SDOH), these
families now face greater financial insecurity and challenges related to their school-aged children. Furthermore,
social distancing requirements and limited telehealth resources for Bronx families have posed greater barriers
to healthcare. Such parental distress contributes to heightened risk of transgenerational cycles of psychological
stress, trauma and maltreatment. Addressing these challenges, we propose a multimodal study tackling both
parental vulnerability and healthcare access. a) Targeting parental vulnerability, we propose to build upon our
12-session therapeutic CARE program, which utilizes Mentalization Based Therapy and designed for parents of
children in treatment in a community psychiatry clinic in our health system. Multiple randomized controlled trials
(RCTs) of attachment-based parenting interventions, including from our group in disadvantaged cohorts from
the Bronx. b) Targeting healthcare access, we propose to utilize the HIPAA-compliant and IRB-approved Valera
Health smartphone application (“app”), which has been studied in our health system in selected cohorts and
resulted in greater access to healthcare. Building upon our work and clinical infrastructure, we hypothesize that
both the CARE program and the Valera app will mitigate the psychological effects of COVID-19 while enhancing
access to healthcare in the Bronx. The study will take place at Montefiore Medical Center (MMC), the largest
health system in the Bronx, which serves predominantly racial and ethnic minority individuals from underserved
families. We will focus on three highly vulnerable cohorts: a) caregivers of children with psychiatric conditions
(N=130); b) caregivers of children with autoimmune illnesses (N=130), and; c) caregivers who are frontline
healthcare workers at MMC (N=100); all presenting with moderate stress. A RCT with 4 arms (2 x 2 design) will
test our hypothesis: a) CARE program alone; b) CARE program + Valera app; c) Parent Education (PE) alone;
d) PE + Valera app. Smartphones and connectivity will be provided as needed. Surveys at study enrollment, 6-,
12- and 24-weeks will assess parental stress, mentalizing capacity (reflective functioning), access to healthcare,
mood and anxiety and additional parent and child clinical measures. Machine learning approaches will explore
complex patterns as predictors of outcome including COVID-19 illness/deaths, medical comorbidity, housing,
poverty, psychopathology, age, family functioning, and trauma. Impact. This multimodal study addresses key
strategies to mitigate the psychological and health impact of COVID-19 in vulnerable populations."
10911925,"ABSTRACT
Multi-omics characterization of a broad spectrum of small subpopulations of cells between tumors and within
individual tumors at the single-cell resolution is crucial to achieve understanding of a complete disease biology.
Furthermore, biologically important clinical specimens are available in low quantity (e.g., <10 tumor cells),
requiring advanced single-cell technologies for effective analysis. However, single-cell proteomics technologies
are lagging far behind other omics technologies. Antibody-based immunoassays are used primarily for targeted
single-cell proteomics, but they have inherent limitations (e.g., low multiplex), and generally lack quantitation
accuracy. Mass spectrometry (MS)-based targeted proteomics has emerged as an alternative for broad accurate
quantification. However, current single-cell MS can only allow for relative quantification of ~870 proteins from
single mammalian cells. There are three major challenges in single-cell MS for accurate quantitative single-cell
proteomics: 1) ineffective processing of single cells, 2) insufficient MS sensitivity and low sample throughput,
and 3) lacking well-characterized universal internal standard (UIS). To address these challenges, we propose to
develop a single-cell MS system for rapid accurate analysis of single-cell proteome. The feasibility is strongly
supported by our recent progress in many aspects of technology development (e.g., introducing the `carrier'
concept for effective processing of small numbers of cells including single cells, and developing disruptive MS
technologies to improve MS detection sensitivity and specificity) as well as our extensive experiences in high-
resolution liquid chromatography (LC) separation for sensitive detection and targeted proteomics analysis for
absolute quantification of signaling pathway proteins. The single-cell MS system will be developed through
1) establishing super-SILAC (stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture) as both proteome carrier
and UIS, 2) incorporation of proteome carrier super-SILAC (cSILAC) into the sample preparation workflow for
robust processing of single cells, and 3) leveraging cutting-edging LC and MS technologies developed at PNNL
with integration of ultralow-flow LC separation, high-efficiency ion source (the combination of an emitter array
technology and sub-ambient pressure ionization with nanoelectrospray), and ultrafast high-resolution ion
mobility separation for significantly improving both MS sensitivity and sample throughput. Super-SILAC will
be characterized as UIS for absolute quantification with crude peptide standards, whose purity will be cost-
effectively accurately determined using a combined lanthanide labeling and ICP-MS method. With 96-well
plate-based cSILAC preparation and well-characterized UIS, the new single-cell MS system is expected to allow
for rapid accurate quantification of a large fraction of human proteome (~60%) in single cells with
~120 samples per day. We anticipate that the new MS system will eventually become a convenient
indispensable tool not only for quantitative single-cell proteomics but also for routine analysis of very small
samples (e.g., rare cells). In turn, it will make substantial contributions to current biomedical research."

10877887,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Clinical Need: Sarcopenia and frailty represent significant and growing clinical challenges whose rates increase
with age, and place patients at risk for functional decline, institutionalization, or death. Resistance exercises are
strongly recommended in this age group to promote muscle regeneration and strength and are routinely a part
of evidence-based home exercise programs prescribed by physical therapists. If conducted as advised, patients
can recover from acute illness, preserve their independence, and reduce their risk of morbidity. Current Clinical
Challenge: A major gap in home exercise programs is a clinician's reliance on self-report diaries or verbal reports
that may be inaccurate or may be subject to recall bias. Remote patient monitoring systems that measure, track,
analyze, and provide patient-oriented feedback may overcome these limitations and have the potential to
enhance exercise adherence. An at-home device that monitors and transmits exercise data to the user and
clinician represents a potential solution to this clinical challenge. Our product – BandPass – SynchroHealth is
a small business entity that developed a remote monitoring solution to fulfil this market need. BandPass consists
of a remote-sensing, Bluetooth-enabled, resistance exercise band that will accurately gauge force through
potentiometric and multi-axial sensors, rigidly fixed to elastic-tubing purposely designed for resistance exercise
training. The device is visually similar to currently available exercise bands familiar to clinicians and patients.
However, the device has a significantly novel addition of integrating force monitoring while connecting to the
cloud through a patient app. A mobile app and a clinician cloud-based platform will provide computational
resources for data visualization, storage, and analysis. This will enable direct patient feedback, clinical monitoring
of patient compliance and progress, and will serve as a platform for more advanced operations such as automatic
exercise-type classification to ease user burden (e.g., minimizing required interactions between the user and
mobile device). Specific Objectives: We propose to commercialize the custom design electronics and housing
for BandPass and perform in-lab validation studies of device accuracy, precision, and long-term stability.
BandPass will be interfaced to a mobile app and cloud-based platform for its data transmission, storage, and
analysis. We will collect data on correct and incorrect usage of BandPass to drive classification algorithms that
will facilitate automatic guidance to patients in completing effective exercise programs. Then, we will conduct a
user-centered design study to examine how to communicate data to patients and clinicians. Finally, we will
deploy BandPass in a pilot study to show initial efficacy at home. Future Directions: SynchroHealth's vision is
to develop a mobile health, user-friendly platform using internet-connected devices to improve the quality of life
and physical function of older adults. At the end of Phase II, we will have demonstrated BandPass' functionality
by providing evidence that it can be deployed at home. This will position us for commercial success by preparing
this Class II exempt medical device for marketing, production, and execution of commercial engagements."

Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest affects over 350,000 people in the U.S. annually, but only 10.8%
survive. Bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) improves survival, but rates of training in the
U.S. are low. It is recently required by law in 39 U.S. states that high school students learn CPR.
However, current methods of teaching CPR use outdated pedagogical strategies and expensive
devices. Previous data indicates that only 12% of students are able to perform high-quality CPR 6
months following standard training. The purpose of this project is to create an interactive video game
experience to teach CPR in classrooms. In phase I, we created an interactive digital film depicting a
dramatic cardiac arrest, a prototype “CPR Spring” to replace traditional CPR manikins, and a plan for
interactivity between the device and the film. Preliminary data showed that the interactive video alone
(without the paired CPR Spring) improved CPR skill acquisition and retention by 50% in high school
students, compared to standard classroom training. The CPR Spring device has properties that more
closely mimic a real human chest than competitor devices. The combined CPR Spring + Interactive
Film was feasible in a classroom setting, engaging to students, and easy to use for teachers.
In phase II of this grant, we will build upon the success of phase I to create a commercially-ready
interactive CPR video game experience. This experience will include a new interactive CPR film
featuring a female victim, addressing gender disparities in bystander CPR. This film will interact with
an improved version of the CPR Spring, which communicates wirelessly with the film through mobile
device-based app and school computer via the local Wi-Fi network, providing real-time CPR quality
feedback for each Spring simultaneously while the film is playing. The interactive CPR video game
experience will improve upon current methods of training, by being: 1) Emotionally Engaging via
realistic cardiac arrest film footage; 2) Multi-sensory, engaging tactile, auditory, visual, and
psychomotor skills; 3) Realistic, both the tactile feel of the CPR Spring AND the realistic film; 4) More
interactive, through answering team-based questions and receiving real-time CPR quality feedback;
5) Affordable and practical, as it does not require an instructor; and 6) Modern, mimicking a video
game experience. We will compare our video game method to standard CPR training in schools,
reporting outcomes including longitudinal CPR skill retention, engagement, and emotional response.
Our goal is to develop a commercially-ready product that is 1/10th the cost and 1/5th the size of
current CPR manikins and requires no instructor, thereby offering a low-cost, low-profile, more
effective CPR course. This product has the potential to become the predominant method for training
CPR in North America, which could lead to more saved lives after cardiac arrest."
10696682,"Neuropathic pain (NP) is a devastating consequence of peripheral nerve injury that most often affects
younger people. NP is often chronic and resistant to current treatments leaving the patient with persistent
disability. A key factor in the genesis of NP after nerve injury stems from activation of microglia in the spinal
cord at the level of injury. This activation leads to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines that
hyperexcite neurons transmitting pain. Pro-inflammatory chemokines also draw in peripheral immune cells
including macrophages and T cells which amplify and sustain the inflammatory milieu underlying NP. A
common regulatory thread for pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, iNOS, CXCL1, and
CCL2, is at the mRNA level where adenine- and uridine--rich elements (ARE) in the 3’ untranslated region
(UTR) modulate mRNA stability, translational efficiency, and ultimately protein expression. Our prior work
has identified HuR as a major positive regulator of these mRNAs in glial cells by binding to the ARE,
translocating to the cytoplasm, and augmenting translation. Our team has developed a novel class of small
molecule inhibitors that block HuR dimerization, a process necessary for its nucleocytoplasmic translocation
and positive regulatory effect. We have shown that the prototype, SRI-42127, potently suppresses
microglial activation and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. In a recently-
published pilot study with the spared nerve injury (SNI) model of NP, we observed a significant attenuation
of allodynic pain in male and female mice after administration of SRI-42127 (8). Using a microglial-selective
HuR knockout mouse model developed in our laboratory, we found that the allodynia-mitigating effect could
be recapitulated only in male mice, indicating a sex dimorphism. In this proposal we hypothesize that
HuR drives NP after nerve injury through its positive regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and
chemokines by resident microglia for male mice and macrophages for female mice. Furthermore,
inhibiting HuR function chemically or by genetic deletion will attenuate this response and reduce
NP. We propose 3 specific aims: (1) Investigate the required dosing schedule, longevity and applicability of
HuR inhibition by SRI-42127 following SNI in male and female mice, (2) Assess the cellular and molecular
mechanisms whereby SRI-42127 attenuates NP after SNI in male and female mice, and (3) Explore sex
differences in immune cell-specific HuR inhibition following SNI using conditional knockout mouse models for
microglia and macrophages. The long term objectives of this proposal are: (1) to advance our small
molecule HuR inhibitors as a potential therapy for NP, and (2) to gain an understanding of how ARE-
mediated RNA regulation impacts NP and the sex-dependent cell types that drive it. The innovation of this
proposal is the investigation of a novel class of HuR inhibitors for targeting the acute inflammatory response
in NP and the mechanistic investigation of post-transcriptional pathways in NP. The significance of this
application extends beyond peripheral nerve injury as the same HuR-regulated pathways drive
neuroinflammation in other forms of NP."
10933409,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Mapping the gene regulatory networks driving human disease enables the design of network-correcting
treatments that target the core disease mechanism rather than merely managing symptoms. I previously
developed a framework for mapping disease-dependent gene networks to enable network-based screening
leveraging machine learning and human induced pluripotent stem cell modeling that identified a promising
network-correcting therapy for cardiac valve disease currently progressing towards clinical trial, reported in
Cell1 and Science2. However, computationally inferring the network map requires large amounts of
transcriptomic data to learn the connections between genes, which impedes network-correcting drug discovery
in settings with limited data including rare disease and disease affecting clinically inaccessible tissues.
Although data remains limited in these settings, recent advances in sequencing technologies have driven a
rapid expansion in the amount of transcriptomic data available from human tissues more broadly. Recently, the
concept of transfer learning has revolutionized fields such as natural language understanding and computer
vision by leveraging deep learning models pretrained on large-scale general datasets that can then be fine-
tuned towards a vast array of downstream tasks with limited application-specific data that would be too limited
to yield meaningful predictions in isolation. To test whether an analogous approach could enable gene network
predictions with limited data, I developed and pretrained my novel deep learning model, Geneformer, with a
large-scale pretraining corpus I assembled with ~30 million human single cell transcriptomes, thereby
generating an invaluable checkpoint from which fine-tuning towards a broad range of downstream applications
could be pursued to accelerate discovery of key network regulators and candidate network-correcting
therapies. Geneformer consistently boosted predictive accuracy in a diverse panel of downstream tasks using
just a limited set of task-specific training examples. I now propose to leverage Geneformer’s learned
understanding of contextual gene network dynamics to address two major challenges in cardiac biology. In Aim
1, I will determine novel dosage-sensitive gene combinations and their context-dependency in cardiac cell
types, thereby generating a map of contextual dosage sensitivity for genes individually or in combination that
has the potential of dramatically improving our interpretation of copy number variants in genetic diagnosis of
cardiac disease. In Aim 2, I will map the dysregulated gene network and discover candidate network-correcting
therapeutics in a prototypical rare disease affecting clinically inaccessible tissue where progress has been
impeded by limited data, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, to accelerate the discovery of a much-needed targeted
therapeutic for this life-threatening progressive disease. Overall, my novel deep learning model, Geneformer,
pretrained with large-scale single cell transcriptomic data has the potential of revolutionizing the field of
network biology through transfer learning to accelerate discovery in settings with limited data."

10990985,"ABSTRACT
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by amyloid beta plaques
and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain along with inflammation both in the brain and systemically. This has led
to the theory of microbial communities or infections as causative in the development of neuroinflammation,
immunosenescence, and inflamm-aging seen in AD. Our own research has demonstrated a decrease in gut
microbiota with anti-inflammatory properties and higher abundances of pro-inflammatory gut microbiota in AD
elders. However, it is unclear how the AD microbiome exerts effects on the central nervous system. To address
this gap in knowledge we have performed gut microbiome profiling, analysis of immune cell populations in blood,
serum cytokine profiling, and cognitive assessments of AD elders at 90-day intervals. This analysis identified
changes in B cell populations with an increased abundance of class-switched and decreased abundance of
naïve B cells at levels of greater cognitive impairment. To better understand how the microbiome may control
AD progression, we propose to investigate the connection between the AD microbiome and the adaptive immune
system with a focus on regulation of the intestinal epithelium by commensal gut bacteria. Specifically, we intend
to use stool and plasma samples collected from our AD cohort to measure makers of intestinal permeability and
determine whether metabolites secreted by the AD gut microbiome cause disruptions in the intestinal epithelium.
We will directly study the disruptive effects of AD stool by applying stool supernatants to intestinal epithelial cells,
quantifying changes in epithelial permeability using established assays, and determining whether specific taxa
depleted in AD are sufficient to cause epithelial disruption. In our previously published data, we have observed
the loss of the phytoestrogen-metabolizing bacteria, Adlercreutzia equolifaciens (AE), in the microbiome of AD
elders. My preliminary studies reveal that a metabolic product of AE, (S)-equol, prevents epithelial damage in
the setting of inflammation. Therefore, we aim to determine whether AE or its metabolic products protect the
intestinal epithelium. To untangle the role of the AD microbiome on our observed changes in class switched and
naïve B cells, I have collected preliminary data which demonstrates that colonization of mice with the microbiome
of AD elders promotes B cell class switching when compared with colonization of cognitively impaired elders
without AD. This application proposes to expand this finding and characterize the changes in the adaptive
immune system caused by the AD microbiome. This continuing work will further establish the connection
between AD related neurocognitive decline, the microbiome, and immune system."

Staphylococcus aureus is a human-adapted pathogen that replicates by asymptomatically colonizing its host.
Nasal colonization is observed in the first weeks of life and persists despite the development of serum IgG
against staphylococcal antigens. S. aureus is also an invasive pathogen, causing soft tissue, wound, lung,
skeletal and bloodstream infections in community- and hospital-settings. Infection with antibiotic-resistant
strains, designated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), is associated with treatment failure and poor
disease outcomes. MRSA and methicillin-sensitive (MSSA) strains are frequent causes of infectious disease
morbidity and mortality in the United States. It is not always clear why colonization progresses to infection but
such transition indicates that antibody responses elicited upon colonization are not protective. The surface of
S. aureus is coated with over 10,000 molecules of Staphylococcal protein A (SpA) linked to peptidoglycan by
the Sortase A enzyme. Using genetic and biochemical schemes, we found that peptidoglycan-modified SpA
diverts antibodies away from their intended targets by interacting with the Fcg domain of IgG and by blocking
complement activation. Thus, surface exposed SpA neutralizes the effector functions of pathogen-specific
antibodies, including antibodies elicited by candidate vaccines. SpA is also released from the bacterial
envelope and binds the variant heavy chains of VH3-IgM that serves as the B cell receptor (BCR) in
approximately half of human B cells. SpA-BCR interactions prevent the development of neutralizing anti-SpA
antibodies and instead trigger B cell proliferation and the secretion of VH3-rearranged antibodies with no
specificity toward S. aureus. Carefully applied molecular engineering yielded the non-toxigenic SpA* vaccine
that elicits SpA-neutralizing antibodies. When tested in our mouse model of colonization that takes advantage
of the mouse-adapted strain WU1, we found that SpA* immunization leads to broad spectrum anti-S. aureus
immune responses. We presume that some of these antibodies target the colonization factors of S. aureus that
we seek to identify in this proposal. We also presume that during colonization SpA diffuses into nasal-
associated lymphoid tissues to reprogram their B cell repertoire. Lastly, we will evaluate mechanisms of
protection against colonization by examining the contribution of serum opsonophagocytic antibodies and
luminal IgA for the nasopharyngeal clearance of S. aureus."

an additional 2-weeks every six-months over the one-year study period—for a total of three times. Objectively
measured sleep data at baseline could potentially influence decision-making regarding HIV treatment (e.g.,
antiretroviral treatment [ART] outcomes) over time, providing a clear temporal ordering and an ability to
consider potential time-lags. Multi-level factors – e.g., individual-level obesity, intimate partner violence, and
spatial proximity to healthcare services – may modify these relationships. The proposed study will be the first
objective sleep health study among any population of Black SMM. Findings from the proposed research have
significant implications for targeting contextually appropriate sleep and HIV interventions as there is a need for
new approaches to inform the next generation of HIV interventions (i.e., long-acting injectables), especially for
Black SMM."

Autologous bone grafting, the current gold standard for treating critical sized bone defects and chronic
nonunions, has limited success, leaving a need for adjunct treatments to contribute to overall bone healing.
Extracellular vesicles, of which there are many types, are a promising new cell-free, membrane-bound
therapeutic in the field of regenerative medicine. Specific to the field of bone regeneration and repair are matrix
vesicles; small extracellular vesicles released by mineralization-competent cells that become anchored in the
extracellular matrix and are a necessary component of mineralized bone formation via endochondral ossification.
They are involved in cellular signaling via small, non-coding microRNA in the growth plate, suggesting that they
may play a similar role in bone. Previous research indicates that chondrocyte-derived matrix vesicles are
enriched with microRNA and other cell signaling molecules that contribute to their ability to influence proliferation
and differentiation of target cells, however the role and mechanism of action of osteoblast-derived matrix
vesicles, particularly in bone as opposed to the growth plate, remains to be elucidated. With this information, the
biological mediation of bone development and regeneration that matrix vesicles provide may translate into novel
therapeutic potential for orthopedic pathologies, including critical size bone defects and fracture nonunions.
Therefore, we hypothesize that matrix vesicles produced by osteoblast-lineage cells, as a specific subset of
extracellular vesicle, use their microRNA cargo to enhance osteogenic differentiation and proliferation, drive
osteogenesis, and aid in bone defect healing. First, we aim to determine the relationship between osteoblast-
derived matrix vesicles and another class of extracellular vesicle, the exosome. Next, we aim to determine the
pathways targeted by matrix vesicle microRNA cargo. Finally, we aim to determine the extent to which
osteoblast-derived matrix vesicles modulate osteogenesis and bone defect healing. To test these aims, we will
use osteoblast-lineage cells to derive matrix vesicles and characterize protein expression, size, and morphology.
We will also use in vitro experimental models to assess pathway involvement and evaluate co-culture response
with osteoblast-like cells. To test the therapeutic potential, we will use a translatable in vivo model of a mouse
long bone defect and a biorthogonal injectable hydrogel to deliver matrix vesicles. We expect to find that
osteoblast-derived matrix vesicles are a specialized subclass of extracellular vesicle with microRNA cargo that
targets the canonical Wnt pathway to activate cellular signaling and leads to increased osteoblastic differentiation
of target cells when co-cultured in vitro. Our in vivo model is expected to demonstrate improved healing upon
treatment with hydrogel-delivered matrix vesicles. All of which together demonstrates the role matrix vesicles
play in the coordinated effort to form new bone and their viability as a therapeutic option to improve bone healing."

COVID-19 vaccination reduces the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe disease, but almost half of
hospitalized breakthrough cases are in immunocompromised individuals. HIV infection is an independent risk
factor for severe COVID-19, hospitalization, and mortality. Immunocompromised individuals are more likely to
have prolonged SARS-CoV-2 infection and viral shedding, increasing the risk of viral transmission and allowing
for rapid evolution of more virulent strains. Therefore, investigating SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in the context of
immunosuppression is urgently needed to reveal factors driving severe COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 lung
pathogenesis is characterized by infiltration of innate and adaptive immune cells into the lung and induction of
an inflammatory immune response. Similar mechanisms of inflammation and immune dysfunction during HIV
infection contribute to systemic HIV pathogenesis and lung pathology. Therefore, dysregulation of immune
responses during HIV infection could induce severe disease outcomes during SARS-CoV-2 coinfection. SARS-
CoV-2 replication occurs in both respiratory and gastrointestinal mucosal sites and enteric symptoms are
associated with COVID-19. There is a defined link between gastrointestinal microbial dysbiosis with accelerated
HIV disease progression and an emerging role of lung and intestinal microbial dysbiosis with severe COVID-19.
Given that the microbiome plays an important role in maintaining mucosal function and homeostasis, shifts in
microbial communities due to HIV infection could contribute to inflammation and immune activation that would
drive exacerbated SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Here, we will test the hypothesis that increased immune
dysfunction and exhaustion, inflammation, and microbial dysbiosis during HIV infection promote enhanced
SARS-CoV-2 lung pathogenesis. We will leverage the pigtail macaque simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)
model of rapid HIV/AIDS and will test this hypothesis during a state of inflammatory untreated SIV infection and
during primary and secondary SARS-CoV-2 viral challenges. We will evaluate the roles of SIV-induced
immunosuppression and altered alveolar macrophage and neutrophil function on SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis
and pulmonary pathology. We will determine whether HIV infection causes gastrointestinal tract and lung
microbial dysbiosis and its association with SARS-CoV-2 disease severity. Lastly, we will determine whether
increased immune exhaustion during HIV infection promotes deficits in the generation of primary anti-viral SARS-
CoV-2 responses that impairs protection from heterologous SAR-CoV-2 re-challenge. These studies will
contribute to our understanding of how normal immunity drives SARS-CoV-2 lung pathophysiology and will
dissect how perturbations of immune responses during HIV infection contribute to enhanced disease."

The overarching goal of this project is to protect the nation’s supply chain of critical medical
devices that are sterilized using ethylene oxide (EtO). Despite the search for alternative
approaches, a large fraction of single-use devices is sterilized with EtO. These devices, including
catheters, heart valves, and tracheostomy tubes, are critical to routine and life-saving procedures
and therapies. As regulations for EtO emissions become more stringent to protect workers and
communities from harmful exposure, there is a significant risk that supply chains for critical
devices will be disrupted, in turn threatening the health and well-being of the nation. The specific
objectives of this project include the development of a novel photocatalytic system to mitigate EtO
at levels that are hazardous but difficult to address with existing adsorptive and thermal catalytic
approaches. Specifically, the technology addresses concentrations in the range of 5 ppm and
below in sterilization facilities, transportation, and warehouses. These “fugitive emissions” are a
significant contributor to overall emissions and directly impact workers and community safety.
Objectives include determining operating conditions at which low concentrations of EtO (<5 ppm)
are oxidized at 99% destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) by identifying the optimum
photocatalyst and parameter space for achieving high DRE. The specific aims are: Aim 1)
optimize a 100 CFM photoreactor fluid flow, optical power, and catalyst parameters for 99% EtO
DRE at fugitive EtO concentrations, Aim 2) develop a 100 CFM system based on the photoreactor
from Aim 1 that can address EtO emissions in a real-world environment, Aim 3) evaluate
performance of the Aim 2 100 CFM system in a sterilization facility, and Aim 4) analyze the Aim
2 system operational lifetime factors. Various computational fluid dynamics and non-sequential
optical models will be leveraged by the experimental efforts. Standard and cutting-edge detection
approaches that are capable of measuring EtO into the low ppb and ppt ranges will be used in the
experimental program."

Global patterns of unequal progress in economic and human development introduce disparities in health at
birth. In the developing world, these changes, accompanied by urbanization, migration, and the nuclearization
of households, are also changing the family context into which children are born. Gaps in health at birth are
not only because of economic inequality: the social support and social status of mothers in their family contexts
are embodied in the health of pregnancies, with consequences for lifelong wellness. However – and despite
the importance of these inequalities for public health – because prior population science has lacked the
population-level biomarkers needed to understand these processes – a comprehensive understanding of
family structure, stress in pregnancy, and disparities in health at birth in the developing world has not
previously been possible. In this mentored project, PI Diane Coffey will pursue training in the biomarkers and
biological processes of stress in pregnancy in the developing world. Training in population-level biomarker
data and stress biology will empower her career as an independent population scientist studying healthy
pregnancy as a start to lifelong wellness. The project has three specific aims. Under Aim 1, Coffey will receive
mentored training in the use of biomarkers in population-level survey data on pregnant women (blood
pressure, obesity, glucose, and hemoglobin), in the biomarkers (cortisol, CRP) and biology of stress in
pregnancy, and in biostatistics. She will complete an extensive program of coursework and guided reading,
and attend workshops and conferences on biomarkers to analyze data for pregnant populations. Aim 2 is for
the PI to conduct within-population studies of consequences of household structures for biomarkers of stress in
pregnancy and birth outcomes. One part of Aim 2 will study the importance of three-generation households;
another part will investigate the consequences of partner absence. Aim 3 is construct international
comparisons and inform theory by comparing outcomes in countries with different forms and intensities of
gender discrimination. Achieving these three aims will prepare the PI to apply for future R01 support as an
independent population scientist. The resulting research agenda will add new biosocial root causes to existing
models of early life health disparities and assessments of the global burden of disease."

Medulloblastoma (MB) is among the most common malignant childhood brain tumors. Although
aggressive treatments have improved outcomes, too many affected children still die of their disease, and
survivors often suffer from severe long-term side effects of therapy. Extensive molecular and biological
heterogeneity underlying MB has been described, culminating in the recognition of consensus molecular
subgroups – WNT, SHH, Group 3, and Group 4 – each of which is associated with divergent genomic
landscapes, patient demographics, and clinical outcomes. Although somatically altered genes and
biological pathways are well annotated, comprehensive understanding of genetic predisposition to MB
has lagged behind. We recently investigated germline loss-of-function (LoF) across all protein-coding
genes in a series of >1,000 MB patients. This unbiased approach uncovered highly significant deleterious
germline variants in ELP1 that were specific to childhood SHH-MB patients and twice as common as
pathogenic variants affecting known MB-associated genes. ELP1 encodes a scaffolding subunit of
Elongator, a multi-subunit protein complex (ELP1-6) that chemically modifies wobble U34 uridines in the
anticodon loop of tRNAs to enable efficient translational elongation and maintenance of physiological
protein folding dynamics. ELP1-associated tumors exhibited frequent co-occurrence of somatic PTCH1
mutations and amplifications of PPM1D and MDM4, suggesting germline ELP1 LoF variants cooperate
with constitutive activation of SHH and/or TP53 signaling to promote MB development. ELP1-associated
SHH-MBs were characterized by a destabilized Elongator complex, loss of Elongator-dependent tRNA
modifications, codon-dependent translational reprogramming, and induction of the unfolded protein
response, consistent with loss of protein homeostasis. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that
ELP1 is a novel cancer predisposition gene and aim to functionally elucidate the developmental,
biochemical, and molecular mechanisms by which pathogenic ELP1 LoF promotes SHH-MB. To test this
hypothesis, we propose to (i) evaluate the requirement for Elp1 during cerebellar development; (ii)
validate the tumor suppressive role of Elp1 in SHH-MB; and (iii) determine the impact of MB-associated
Elp1 LoF on translation and the proteome. These studies will be conducted in a series of novel Elp1+/-
transgenic mice, primary cells derived from the developing mouse cerebellum, and genetically faithful
SHH-MB patient-derived xenografts. Successful execution of this research program will effectively link
germline ELP1 LoF to the biochemical and molecular mechanisms governing SHH-MB pathogenesis.
Outcomes of the proposed research will be of broad interest, extending to scientists and clinicians with
an interest in cancer predisposition, as well as basic researchers studying the fundamentals of
translational regulation and protein homeostasis and their role in human disease."

We have identified mutations in the X-linked, RNA helicase DDX3X as the second most frequent mutation in
medulloblastoma (MB). We now show that DDX3X: (i) orchestrates normal hindbrain patterning and
development; (ii) suppresses the initiation of Wnt and Shh MB; (iii) restricts the susceptibility of specific NPCs to
generate these tumors; and (iv) serves as a `rheostat' in the stress response, regulating global patterns of gene
transcription and translation and live-die `decisions. Our studies also helped explain why WNT-MBs are
eminently curable. We showed that paracrine signals driven by mutant CTNNB1 in WNT-MB disrupts the blood
brain barrier (BBB), permitting the accumulation of high levels of intra-tumoral chemotherapy and a robust
therapeutic response. Here, we will continue our focus on WNT-MB to address three new Specific Aims that will:
determine how DDX3X regulates cell fate decisions in the normal and malignant hindbrain; generate novel
immunotherapies of WNT MB; and translate new treatments of WNT MB to clinical trial."
10909912,"Data Analyses Core: Abstract
The Data Analysis Core (DAC) will provide the expertise to manage, model, and analyze data generated by the
Duke Tissue Mapping Center (TMC), so as to deliver senescent cell signatures and tissue maps of senescent
cells to the CODCC. This will be achieved by pragmatic and innovative execution of the mandated aims – Data
Processing, Data Analysis, Map Construction and Consortium Coordination. The Data Processing team will be
responsible for the implementation of a cloud native platform on Microsoft Azure that will process data
according to FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) guidelines. The team will coordinate
with the Biospecimen Core to document potential confounding variables such as race, sex, live or cadaveric
tissue origin; with the Biological Analysis Core for their expertise in optimal pipelines for processing specific
assay data, and with the Data Analysis team to ensure the data is collected in a format that is interoperable
with downstream analysis. The Data Analysis team will be responsible for the characterization of senescent
cell signatures that takes into account the heterogeneity of senescent cells and the dynamics of transitioning to
the senescent state. The team will use an iterative strategy to identify senescent cells, identify and expand
associated markers, and characterize the functional signature conditional on the biological context of the
senescent cell. The team will make use of organoids for initial characterization of the dynamic signature, using
these putative signatures to identify rare senescent cells in normal tissue (including biofluids), and refine the
putative signature by re-weighting signature elements based on the extent to which they occur in senescent
cells in normal tissue. The Map Construction team will be responsible for the development of spatial maps of
senescent cells in normal tissue using advanced computational biology methods, innovative tensor analysis
approaches and modern deep learning architectures. The team will integrate data from spatial assays
(multiplexed immunohistochemistry images, Visium spatial transcriptomics, and Cartana in-situ sequencing)
and single cell assays (combined scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq) to build spatial maps predictive of the
transcriptome, epigenome and secretome of senescent cells in normal tissue from lung, heart, muscle and
skin. The team will also develop a dashboard tool that interfaces with Azure for map visualization, and evaluate
the accuracy of these maps using cross-validation, data sets from public repositories, and maps constructed by
other TMCs. The Consortium Coordination team will be responsible for annotation of all data sets using terms
from NIH Common Data Elements Repository and OBO Foundry ontologies, creation of policies for data and
metadata capture, definition of practices for reproducible analysis including use of containers and workflow
orchestration scripts, and conversion of data, models, pipelines and tissue maps to interoperable formats for
uploading to the CODCC. The team will also lead the collaborative development, with other interested parties
from the SenNet consortium, of a Senescent Cell Ontology."
