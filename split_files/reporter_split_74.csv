This Administrative Supplement to the Idaho INBRE Program will develop new cloud-based learning modules.
The project will expand the NIGMS Sandbox repository with modules that can be incorporated into curricula,
workshops, and training. This funding will increase the capacity of Idaho to participate in cutting-edge
biomedical research. The activity is within the scope of the parent INBRE award #P20 GM103408. It fits within
the broad and inclusive Idaho INBRE activities to improve the state’s capacity to do biomedical research and
provide STEM training and research skills to capable students. Specifically, we will construct a set of self-
paced, self-learning modules to teach foundational bioinformatics programming in Python, and version control
with git and GitHub. The proposed modules will be appropriate for integration into undergraduate/graduate
curricula and for self-learning by individuals who are new to biology research. Most of the current GitHub
NIGMS Sandbox modules use the Python programming language, extensively. However, no module teaches
Python. This is a barrier to participation since faculty and students alike often lack the coding skills to perform
data analysis independently by adapting scripts to novel circumstances. There is thus a critical need for a
Sandbox module which will teach foundational computing skills of Python programming and about GitHub and
git. Our overall objective is to develop a module that will enable users to use Python and git to store, analyze,
and draw inferences from biological data with cloud computing. Three Specific Aims will be addressed: (1)
Adapt our current Foundations of Python for Data Science course to a cloud-based module for the NIGMS
Sandbox (2) Develop exercises that incorporate bioinformatic data sets and questions for each lesson and a
final project for each unit. (3) Test the modules with undergraduate and graduate students in biology. This new
Sandbox module is expected to have a positive impact on (i) FAIR data sharing via GitHub repositories, (ii) the
innovative use of bioinformatic analysis to solve biological problems because researchers will have the Python
skills to adapt and use tools and, (iii) the pipeline of students who have the coding skills to use cloud
computing to analyze, process, and share biological data."
11034889,"Summary
 Mitochondria are essential organelles that control the life and death of cells. Mitochondria are highly
dynamic: They grow, divide, and fuse, and when they eventually become damaged, undergo degradation
Mitochondrial division is mediated by a dynamin-related GTPase, DRP1, while fusion is mediated by two
dynamin-related GTPases, OPA1 and mitofusin. These GTPases are mutated in human diseases, including
neurodevelopmental disorder, Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy, and optic atrophy. Altered activities of these
proteins have also been linked to metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, and age-related
neurodegeneration. My laboratory’s goal is to decipher the molecular mechanisms that control mitochondrial
structure and translate the fundamental biology to disease interventions. In the past two decades, we have
identified and characterized the three essential GTPases in the core reactions of membrane fusion and
division. The roles of mitochondrial dynamics are ever-expanding, and now include size control of
mitochondria, their distribution and turnover, and differentiation of neurons, cardiomyocytes, stem cells, and
immune cells. Most recently, it became evident that the mechanisms of mitochondrial division and fusion are
much more complex than initially imagined, involving inter-organelle interactions and a feedback response that
monitors and tunes their balance. The emerging new biology is transforming the field of mitochondrial structure
and dynamics. In the next 5 years, we will address the important questions raised by this intellectual evolution.
 First, to our surprise, we found that DRP1 shapes the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) into tubules that form
contract sites with mitochondria. DRP1-produced ER-mitochondria contact sites strongly promote
mitochondrial division. We will investigate how DRP1 creates ER-mitochondria contact sites that
specifically function in mitochondrial division, associates with the ER, and deforms the ER membrane.
Second, we discovered a physiological pathway of mitochondrial turnover via DRP1-controlled, Parkin/PINK1-
independent mitophagy in mice. This pathway’s most upstream event is to recognize and mark damaged
mitochondria by ubiquitination of mitochondrial proteins. Our initial experiments suggested that ubiquitination
occurs in two phases – reversible initiation and committed amplification. We will determine what
ubiquitinates mitochondria in each phase, and how the ubiquitin ligase complexes recognize and label
damaged mitochondria in vivo. Third, we found the first example of a stress response (MitoSafe) that senses
and adjusts the mitochondrial structure by controlling the balance between fusion and division. We will
explore the molecular basis of MitoSafe and its physiological roles in mice. The MIRA grant will enable
us to discover the new logics of mitochondrial structure and its physiological role and regulation in vivo."
11034898,"Project Summary
 Post-translational signaling through ubiquitination is essential to all eukaryotic life, and dysregulation of this
process can lead to severe forms of disease. The far-reaching importance of ubiquitin signaling across many
cellular processes stems from its ability to form a diverse set of polymeric chains that signal for distinct outcomes.
The complexity of ubiquitin signaling vastly outweighs our understanding of its regulation and cellular outcomes.
While the signaling roles for some ubiquitin chain types are known (e.g. protein degradation or cell cycle
regulation), the functions of many so-called `atypical' chains have remained a mystery despite decades of
research. As an alternative approach to studying fundamental human biology, we study the interactions between
invading pathogenic bacteria and the host ubiquitin signaling network. In addition to a range of other ubiquitin-
targeted activities, to support infection bacteria have evolved secreted effector proteins to assemble and remove
host ubiquitin signals, in some cases with exquisite specificity toward discrete ubiquitin chain types. We propose
that ubiquitin-targeted bacterial effectors represent a rich opportunity to study human ubiquitin signaling from an
`outside-in' perspective. To explore this opportunity, we have developed a multipronged approach that has
identified novel ubiquitin-targeted activities among important bacterial pathogens. Using structural and
biochemical approaches we will explain the mechanisms and specificities of these bacterial enzymes, at which
point they will be used as case studies and tools to extend our work toward deciphering the regulatory and
signaling complexities of the human ubiquitin system. Our innovative approach to studying ubiquitin biology plays
to our strengths in the biochemical mechanisms of its regulation, and leverages the strong evolutionary pressure
placed on bacteria to usurp specific aspects of host ubiquitin signaling. Over the next five years we will
demonstrate the breadth of bacterial ubiquitin-targeted activities and their utility for dissecting the intricacies of
ubiquitin signaling, which feeds into our larger vision of understanding the motivations and ramifications of
bacterial interference in host signaling processes."
11035051,"Anticipated Impacts on Veterans Health Care: This project will put forth a comprehensive geospatial
framework to address the VA Blueprint for Excellence Strategy 3: Leverage information technologies,
analytics, and models of healthcare to optimize individual well-being and population health outcomes.
By creating a spatially referenced dataset incorporating health information, workforce productivity,
neighborhood deprivation, we will develop a comprehensive database to examine multiple dimensions of
diabetes care. Through the use of advanced GIS and spatiotemporal statistics, we will identify hotspots of high
disease risk, poor neighborhood resources, and low VA workforce capacity. This information will improve
access to care by helping VA policy makers better match resources to areas with poor outcomes. Finally, by
pinpointing areas with excessive health expenditures, the VA can develop cost-reduction measures to improve
Veterans’ health while containing costs.
Background: Diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States, can lead to serious
complications, and is associated with increased healthcare costs. Prevalence estimates for Veterans show a
disproportionate burden of disease, with estimates close to 25%, as compared to 8% of the general US
population. Evidence consistently shows racial minorities have a higher prevalence of diabetes, worse
outcomes, higher risk of complications, and higher mortality rate compared to non-Hispanic whites. This
disparity persists after controlling for patient-level factors such as education, income, knowledge, health
literacy, and self-efficacy; provider-level factors, such as bias, communication, and trust; and system-level
factors, such as access to care. Little attention has been given to differences that may be explained by regional
variation in patient-level resources, community-level resources, and health workforce resources.
Objectives: This study seeks to identify and explain spatial and temporal variation in health outcomes,
community resources, VA workforce capacity, and health disparities among patients with type 2 diabetes. Aim
1 will examine spatiotemporal trends in diabetes outcomes, including metabolic control, cost, and mortality.
Aim 2 will develop a new spatiotemporal neighborhood deprivation index and examine its association with
diabetes outcomes and racial disparities. Aim 3 will develop and validate a novel geographic workforce
deprivation index to examine its association with diabetes outcomes and racial disparities.
Methods: We will construct a cohort of veterans with type 2 diabetes receiving either inpatient or outpatient
care at the VA during the years 2000 through 2015 by linking multiple patient and administrative files from the
VHA National Patient Care and Pharmacy Benefits Management databases, using a previously validated VA
algorithm. Using advanced GIS and spatial statistical methods, we will examine spatiotemporal trends in
diabetes outcomes among Veterans with type 2 diabetes. In Aim 1, we will develop a flexible Bayesian
spatiotemporal model to identify hotspots of high prevalence of diabetes-related outcomes. In Aims 2 and 3,
we will use spatiotemporal latent factor models to develop novel neighborhood and workforce deprivation
indices, allowing us to investigate evolving patterns in community resource availability and VA workforce
capacity. Completion of these aims will enable the VA to identify individual, community, and institutional factors
associated with poor diabetes outcomes and to target community and system-level efforts to improve health in
low-resource areas."

Montana is one of the most rural states in the country, and rural populations suffer disproportionately from
several adverse health outcomes. The Center for Population Health Research’s (CPHR) mission is to foster
investigator-initiated research aimed at improving population health in rural settings. Our Phase I Center of
Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) achieves this by supporting funded research projects and providing
investigators with funded project support, mentoring, and two research support cores. The CPHR Data and
Modeling (DM) Core provides researchers with statistical and environmental modeling expertise, support for
acquisition of secondary patient health and related data, and access to a high-performance computing
environment. The CPHR Intervention Support (IS) Core provides expertise and services for primary data
collection, including survey administration and qualitative method design, an opportunity that is now available
to researchers in this post-pandemic environment. Our core of early career investigators has recently identified
a need for support to enhance field-based primary data collection. CPHR investigators cover a variety of
clinical research topics, but one commonality across our center is understanding disease risk determinants in
order to inform, develop, and test interventions in rural communities. Thus, the CPHR early career
investigators that are engaging with rural patients and populations require the ability to mobilize recruitment,
data gathering, and community engagement in the field. Through this administrative supplement for equipment
purchases application (NOT-GM-24-021), we will be able to acquire and operationalize a mobile clinical
laboratory to support the identified needs of CPHR early career investigators and other CPHR-affiliated
researchers. The research capabilities supported by this mobile laboratory and related components will include
field-based community outreach, capture of clinical and environmental measures, patient/participant clinical
consultation, collection of biomonitoring data, secure and private administration of survey instruments, and
facilitation of qualitative data collection. By integrating this equipment and capability with our CPHR IS Core we
will be able to ensure sustainability for equipment operations through our established user charges structure.
The addition of these capabilities to our existing research mentorship and research support cores will serve as
a force multiplier for ensuring that our current and future investigators are able to develop and sustain impactful
independent research careers."
11034202,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In the progression from middle to older-age, healthy adults typically experience improvements in their emotional
functioning, such as increases in positive emotion and greater expertise in managing emotions. However, not
everyone shows these age-related improvements, and the mechanisms that give rise to emotional functioning
changes across adulthood are still poorly understood. The primary goal of this project is to examine the critical
factors that promote positive emotional development in normative aging, and to test whether depression history
might moderate this process as a key trait individual difference marker. To this end, we test our proposed Value-
Based Cognitive Control Model of Emotion Regulation in ADulthood (VBCC-MERiAD). The VBCC-MERiAD
framework suggests a novel insight: that interactions between reward motivation and cognitive control play a
central role in understanding both the normative trajectory of emotional functioning in older adults, and
conversely, why and how individuals with depression histories may get “off track”. We focus on effectively
upregulating positive emotion, given that older adults prioritize positive emotion goals, and because depression
is characterized by blunted reward processing. Our primary hypothesis is that positive emotion regulation (ER)
abilities will rely upon the integrity of fronto-striatal circuitry (i.e., activity and connectivity between the lateral
prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens / ventral striatum). Engagement of this circuit is predicted to reflect the
utilization of reward motivation as a means of engaging cognitive control (i.e., to update and maintain ER goals).
Across three Specific Aims, we propose to characterize the mechanisms of ER in middle-aged and older adults
(35-74), focusing on neural and behavioral indicators of motivation and cognitive control that predict daily
emotional functioning, and potential dysregulation in individuals with depression history. To achieve these aims,
we will employ a multi-method design involving functional neuroimaging measures, laboratory behavioral
assessments, and experience sampling methods. The sample (N=220) will include an ethnically/racially diverse
set of adults (66% women) of ages 35-74, equally subdivided into two groups: healthy controls and people with
depression histories. A state-of-the art neuroimaging protocol will assess brain activity associated with different
ER strategies, and test for linkages with reward-motivated cognitive control. The comprehensive laboratory
assessments will include diagnostic interviewing, self-report measures, cognitive functioning batteries, and a
standardized ER task with measures of autonomic reactivity and behavioral coding of emotion. The experience
sampling protocol will provide a naturalistic, ecologically valid assessment of participants’ emotional
experiences, goals and regulatory strategies. The proposed research will dramatically extend our understanding
of both normative and dysfunctional age-related change in emotional function, by identifying mechanisms that
promote positive ER in late adulthood. In so doing, we will lay the foundation for new interventions to improve
quality of life for healthy older adults and preventative therapeutic targets for individuals with depression history."
11034633,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rapidly progressive, paralytic, and ultimately fatal disease that
can be caused by gain-of-function mutations in superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1). Despite its severity,
there remains no cure for ALS and current therapies provide only modest benefit to patients,
underscoring the critical need for new, effective strategies for treating the disease.
We have developed an approach to inactivate the production of the mutant SOD1 protein in vivo
using CRISPR base editing, a gene-editing modality capable of introducing precise single-base
substitutions in DNA, but without the requirement for a mutagenic DNA break, thus overcoming a
major safety hurdle facing the implementation of traditional CRISPR nucleases. Through the support
of the CREATE Bio Optimization Track, we have undertaken a milestone-driven research plan that
has enabled us to refine not only the editing capabilities but also the specificity of our SOD1-targeting
CRISPR base-editing platform.
As a next step in this project, we will define the properties of our lead SOD1-targeting platform in
cynomolgus macaques, a non-human primate (NHP) model that shares more anatomical,
physiological, and immunological similarities with humans than most laboratory animals. However, a
worsening shortage of NHPs, alongside increases in their demand for research, has resulted in
unanticipated and hefty cost increases for an already limited domestic supply. To this end, this
Administrative Supplement will contribute to the acquisition of two adult cynomolgus macaques, their
intrathecal dosing with an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector formulation encoding our CRISPR
base-editing platform, their housing, and the isolation of nervous system tissue and peripheral
tissues. This Supplement will thus ensure that our study carries sufficient statistical power to most
accurately quantify the effects for our therapeutic agent and as such is critical to the completion of the
milestones for the project, “Optimization of an in vivo base editing strategy to treat SOD1-linked ALS”
(5U01NS122102).
In sum, by providing us with the statistical power to most accurately quantify the efficacy, tolerability,
and immunological responses of our novel CRISPR gene therapy in the nervous system of a NHP,
this Administrative Supplement will ensure that our project exerts a maximum impact on its field and
the field of gene therapy at large."
11034306,"Project Summary
Streptomyces are ubiquitous filamentous sporulating soil bacteria, important in the environment
because they degrade and recycle the nutrients locked in many recalcitrant natural polymers in the
soil (e.g., cellulose and chitin) and produce the majority of a wide range of biologically active
compounds that are used extensively in human and veterinary medicine (e.g., antibiotic, antiviral,
anticancer, antitumor, antifungal, immunosuppressant and anthelmintic pharmaceuticals).
Streptomyces are also well known as one of the major producers of the compounds that give soil its
characteristic earthy odor. These organisms have large linear genomes. Little is known about the
architecture of the linear chromosome within the Streptomyces spore and the mechanisms which
govern its development-associated genome segregation and nucleoid condensation during spore
formation are poorly understood. The ultimate goal from the proposed basic research is to have a
better understanding of the novel cellular processes of these distinctive organisms of tremendous
medical importance.
The unusual mycelial life cycle and linear structure of the Streptomyces genome are likely to require
some unique solutions to the fundamental problems of genome segregation and condensation. The
first specific aim of the proposal is to characterize a novel small coiled-coil protein that is exclusive to
this group of organisms. A genetic approach was used to provide evidence that this protein is
involved in development-associated genome segregation. A proximity-labeling approach, with a
promiscuous biotin ligase fusion, is being used to identify proteins that interact with this novel protein
in vivo. Alanine-scanning and random PCR-directed mutageneses are being used to identify residues
important for protein-protein interaction with one known binding partner. The second specific aim is to
characterize type VII secretion system ATPase proteins. In addition to their functions in protein
secretion, the ATPase proteins are moonlighting in development-associated segregation and nucleoid
condensation. A genetic approach will be used to dissect the first type VII secretion ATPase to
identify the region(s) needed for genome segregation. A genetic approach will also be used to
determine the parts of both type VII secretion ATPases to identify the regions necessary for correct
nucleoid condensation in the spore. Mutants lacking genes encoding both type VII secretion ATPases
have genomes organized against the spore periphery (doughnut-shaped) instead of being condensed
as an ellipsoid nucleoid in the center of the spore."

Osteochondral defects (OCDs) – localized damage to the cartilage and subchondral bone of a joint – often
lead to pain, loss of joint function, and osteoarthritis. This work seeks to develop a superior treatment (versus
autografting, allografting, and partial resurfacing implants) to treat OCDs of knees and other joints. Proposed
is a bioprosthetic implant – a “cartilage-capped, regenerative osteochondral plug (CC-ROP)” - that
combines a permanent synthetic resurfacing cartilage cap and a biodegradable bone regenerative
base. The cartilage cap will be prepared from a biostable, ultra-tough hydrogel, circumventing the low
regeneration potential of cartilage tissue and providing immediate matching of the strength, stiffness,
hydration, lubricity, and wear-resistance of native cartilage. The underlying biodegradable scaffold base will
promote new bone formation to anchor the cartilage cap. The CC-ROP’s autograft-sized, cylindrical geometry
will allow for implantation with existing surgical techniques. To promote healing and functionality, both the
cartilage cap and osseous scaffold base will be designed to also support integration with adjacent tissue.
Cartilage cap: Synthetic, biostable cartilage replacements (e.g., UHMWPE) lack the combined biomechanical
properties of native cartilage, and do not provide critical integration to adjacent tissue. Thus, CC-ROP’s
cartilage cap will be prepared with a new electrostatic, double network (DN) hydrogel that has been shown
by the team to mimic the stiffness, strength, and lubrication of native articular cartilage. Poration at the
perimeter of the cap and a bioactive polydopamine coating will encourage in-growth of adjacent tissue.
Osseous scaffold base: The base will be formed with a biodegradable, templated semi-interpenetrating
polymer network (semi-IPN) PCL:PLLA scaffold that the team has shown supports hBMSC osteogenesis in
vitro, as well as neotissue formation and integration in vivo. CC-ROP: To evaluate their potential to heal
OCDs, CC-ROPs will be evaluated in terms of metrics of cartilage resurfacing and integration, as well as
osseous tissue regeneration and integration. Prof. Melissa Grunlan (PI) will lead all efforts in Aims 1-2
related to the fabrication of the CC-ROPs. Prof. Mariah Hahn (Co-I) will lead in vitro cell culture studies
(Aim 1) to evaluate hBMSC behavior on the osseous scaffolds as well as the potential for chondrocytic
invasion into the cartilage cap and immunoreactivity of potential cap wear debris. In Aim 2, the in vivo
performance of the CC-ROPs in a rabbit femoral condyle OCD model will be assessed. Prof. Brian Saunders
(Co-I) will lead subcutaneous biocompatibility studies (in rats) and OCD studies (in rabbits) in terms of
histology and micro-CT. Prof. Michael Moreno will lead efforts to test the biomechanical properties of the
explanted rabbit knees and controls. A veterinary pathologist, Prof. Roy Pool (consultant), will read and score
histology slides (Aim 2). Dr. Patrick McCulloch (consultant), an orthopedic surgeon, will provide guidance."
11011955,"The Partnership for Native American Cancer Prevention (NACP) Shared Resource, Guiding U54

Western knowledges and ways of knowing, and to use both of these eyes together for the benefit of all.” 1
GUIDeS adapts this approach to allow the two perspectives of the GPs and GUIDeS Co-Leaders to meld these
perspectives to promote positive career trajectories. GUIDeS interacts with the other NACP Cores and
research projects to ensure services and expertise across NACP are available to early researchers.
 Since its beginning in 2019, GUIDeS supported 29 GPs cancer or health disparity grant proposals and
seven American Indian Alaska Native (AIAN) CURE pipeline submissions, exceeding the NACP 5-year goal to
submit six applications to the CURE pipeline. Since GUIDeS is in its early stages, the adaption of the two-
eyed seeing approach was used to improve the Shared Resource for the next grant cycle.
Aim 1. Increase the development and submission of cancer research grants and manuscripts by
identifying mentors to support GPs in developing a path to successful academic research addressing cancer
disparities among Native Americans.
Aim 2. Provide enhanced analytical support for cancer research by providing GPs with workshops, and
analytical infrastructure to enhance contributions to cancer health disparities research.
Aim 3. Support extended opportunities for professional and career development by providing academic
career planning opportunities for early-stage faculty using a “mapping strategy” to set aside blocks of time for
teaching, writing of grants and publications. GUIDeS will assist in navigating the university promotion and

11011957,"Obesity disparities among American Indian (AI) youth exist and, to date, there are limited interventions
available to successfully address weight and consequential outcomes for AI youth. The high prevalence of
youth-based obesity is alarming, placing them at disproportionate risk for adult obesity and obesity-driven
metabolic diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, and stroke. In addition,
although cancer has traditionally been considered a distinct spectrum of disease, increasing evidence supports
the importance of metabolic disturbances in the cause of cancer. This underscores the urgent need to
address excess weight in AI youth to protect against obesity-related diseases, including cancers, in
later life. Schools provide concentrated time with students, provide up to 50% of daily food intake, provide
physical activity opportunities, and teach health education. Tribal schools participating in the federal school
meal programs are required to adopt and implement a School Wellness Policy (SWP) that sets clear
expectations for nutrition education, foods served and sold, physical activity and physical education practices.
Despite widespread research on the implementation of SWPs in U.S. schools, their generalizability to
schools in tribal communities remains limited, highlighting a major gap in understanding how tribal
schools adopt and implement SWPs. The goal of P2 is to engage and partner with 3 separate tribal schools
on Navajo Nation. The objectives are to implement an established health promotion curricula among 4th
graders after completing formative research to strengthen SWPs at each school, to establish a baseline for
each school. We will use a train-the-trainer approach to establish structured lessons and practices, as
warranted, for physical education instructors and food service personnel, for example. The health promotion
curricula for the students will include culturally tailored health education focused on nutrition and physical
activity. We hypothesize that participation in our health promotion efforts will strengthen school-specific
SWPs, including structured physical activity, and that 4th grade youth will increase their knowledge and exhibit
improved behaviors for fruits and vegetables consumption and increased physical activity.
 Specific Aim 1 – Complete formative assessments at three K-8 Navajo Nation tribal schools to understand
the capacity and resources of each to implement a train-the-trainer approach to establish structured lessons
and practices, as warranted, for physical education instructors and food service personnel.
 Specific Aim 2 – Assess changes in the knowledge and behaviors of Navajo youth exposed to a culturally
appropriate health promotion curriculum during the academic school year. Changes in fruits and vegetables
consumption and physical activity will be compared between 4th graders to 3rd graders.

recently, cycle 4 trainees who were undergraduates in cycles 1 and 2 advanced to post-doctoral fellowships,
faculty positions, and clinician roles. We have also expanded our capacity to train more undergraduates
(N=146) in the current cycle and accelerated degree attainment; 73 graduate degrees were completed by
AIAN students in this cycle alone. The number of doctoral degrees attained now exceeds that of the prior 3
cycles combined. Thus, NACP has positioned our institutions as national leaders in AIAN education. NAU
leads the nation in undergraduate Public Health degrees and UA leads the nation in AIAN conferred doctoral
degrees.3-5 These successes are due in large part to the innovative approach to training embedded in
indigenous perspectives that we have honed with our AIAN faculty, students, and Community Advisory Board
(CAB). We have demonstrated that wrap-around support of students, including a “web” of mentors and
activities provides a culturally appropriate and highly effective environment for recruiting and retaining AIAN
students.6 Activities focus on enhancing students’ research skills by providing curricular programming and
hands-on mentored cancer research, complemented by career development planning and a wide range of role
models at both institutions. This mature REC program will expand across the Four Corners Region (AZ, CO,
UT, NM) to allow us to share more broadly our training and mentoring approach and increase the network for
student placement. We will embrace the two-eyed seeing paradigm as we expand the web of support which
will allow us to “see from one eye with the strengths of Indigenous knowledges and ways of knowing, and from
the other eye with the strengths of Western knowledges and ways of knowing”.7

11032296,"Project Summary:
Colorectal cancer (CRC) accounts for nearly 10% of all cancer diagnoses in the VA system1.
Additionally, the VA system treats 3% of the total number of US cases of CRC and 6% of all US
cases in males2. The immune response to CRC is critical to therapeutic response and survival.
Cytotoxic T cells (CTL) are the end mediators of the anti-tumor response. As expected, tumor
associated CTL are also associated with treatment response and survival in CRC. In our murine
model of colorectal cancer, we have found that depending on the therapeutic regimen used, there
is a differential effect on the number and type of CTL in the tumor microenvironment. FOLFOX
chemotherapy, the first-line chemotherapeutic regimen in CRC, controls tumor growth better than
individual arms alone and engenders increased antigen specific CTL in the tumor
microenvironment. Our understanding of how FOLFOX chemotherapy affects tumor associated
CTL type and response is unknown. This information is critical for the future design of clinical
trials testing novel therapeutic combinations in CRC. In this VA CDA-2 proposal, we will study the
differential effect of FOLFOX chemotherapy on CTL type, function, signaling, exhaustion, and
memory. Additionally, we will test the effect of innate immune sensing to induce CTL and work in
combination with FOLFOX in CRC.
A multi-disciplinary team of VA Merit and NIH-R01 funded clinician-scientists and basic
scientists have been recruited to comprise a mentorship team designed to ensure the success
of the application candidate. The data and skill development outlined in this proposal will ensure
the development of a successful research career for the candidate and pre-clinical data in
support of future clinical trials in CRC utilizing immune based therapy in combination
chemotherapy."

We are requesting an Administrative Supplement for Equipment Purchases to obtain an AKTA Pure 25M
Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography (FPLC) System to replace our failing AKTA Purifier FPLC system
installed in 2007. The requested instrument meets all of our specific needs and will maintain
compatibility with our existing chromatography media and methods. The AKTA Pure 25M is capable of
detecting multiple wavelengths, which is essential when working with the fluorescent dyes needed for
single molecule experiments. The proposed system is capable of the full range of chromatography
methods in particular the low pressure columns we use for small scale purifications. The ability to
generate recombinant protein samples of high purity and then separate them from fluorescent dyes
forms the basis of all experiments under the parent award. This award was funded for 4 years starting

11034621,"The Central Dogma of molecular biology is that DNA is used to make mRNA, which in turn is used to make
proteins. Central to physiology of every live cell, translation of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) into proteins is
catalyzed by the ribosome, structurally complex and dynamic macromolecular machine. Dysregulation of
translation plays an important role in a number of human diseases including cancer. While some fundamentals
of protein synthesis have been revealed, many molecular details of ribosomal translation remain unknown. For
example, it is unclear why some mRNAs are translated orders of magnitude more efficiently than the others,
and how mRNA structure regulates protein synthesis. My laboratory investigates molecular mechanisms of
translation by studying structural dynamics of the ribosome, and the role of mRNA secondary structure in
translation regulation. We use single-molecule microscopy and biochemical approaches to address the
following questions: (i) How does the small ribosomal subunit move along mRNA in search for the start site for
translation initiation in eukaryotes? (ii) How does the intrinsic compactness of mRNA and intramolecular
basepairing interactions formed by the 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNA regulate the efficiency
of protein synthesis in eukaryotes? (iii) How do mRNA stem-loop structures induce ribosome translation
pauses, which control expression of a number of proteins in bacteria, eukaryotes and eukaryotic viruses,
including Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2? (iv)
How are structural dynamics of eukaryotic ribosome (in particular, rotational movements between the small
and the large ribosomal subunits) converted into the intricate process of protein synthesis? Our studies will
substantially contribute to establishing the molecular mechanisms of protein synthesis, and provide the basis
for the future development of antiviral and cancer therapies."

dissect molecular mechanisms for how microtubule lengths are regulated inside of cells. We use
biophysical computational modeling to better integrate and understand our experimental
observations, make new experimental predictions, and to test whether our proposed cellular
mechanisms are physically reasonable. Overall, we are a cellular biophysics laboratory that
combines cell biology tools with biophysical methods to shed new light on the regulation of
microtubule dynamics during mitosis. Achieving the goals described in this application will allow
us to expand the sources of tubulin that can be used for imaging of microtubule dynamics, thus
establishing stronger connections between cellular and organismal phenotypes, especially
through the use of targeted mutagenesis. Our first project will involve the pathogenic yeast
Candida albicans. Thus, we will advance our understanding of (a) how C. albicans microtubule
dynamics compare to mammalian microtubule dynamics, (b) how a range of current
microtubule-targeting drugs differentially alter microtubule dynamics in C. albicans relative to
mammalian tubulin, and (c) how changes in microtubule dynamics parameters lead to the
disruption of cell division in the pathogenic yeast C. albicans, as compared to in human cells.
Further, we expect that computational modeling and ultrastructural analysis of C. albicans
tubulin will allow us to connect molecular-level and cellular-level drug phenotypes and
outcomes."
11034613,"Project Summary
 The neural circuits controlling motor behaviors vital to mammals, including walking, breathing, and
balance, rely on the ability of neurons within the spinal cord to establish selective connections during
development. Work over the past decade has provided a fairly comprehensive understanding of the
genetic pathways that determine the identity of each major neuronal class within the neural tube. The
mechanisms through which neurons acquire subtype identities necessary for the incorporation into a
particular motor circuit are, however, still poorly defined. Our studies on the specification of spinal
motor neurons indicate that the large family of Hox transcription factors play key roles in generating
the hundreds of subtypes required for selective innervation of muscle. Hox proteins orchestrate
genetic programs that control diverse aspects of motor neuron maturation, including their topographic
organization, peripheral target muscle specificity, and presynaptic partners. Emerging studies from
our group also indicate that Hox genes function in multiple neuronal classes to shape synaptic
specificity during development, suggesting a broader role in circuit assembly. The overall goals of the
proposed research are to elucidate the mechanisms of neural diversification and connectivity within
the spinal cord, and to determine how Hox-dependent and -independent genetic programs establish
the circuit architectures necessary for motor control. Ultimately, we hope to uncover the pathways
through which genetically encoded developmental programs contribute to the emergence of specific
motor behaviors. Our approach integrates selective genetic manipulations of neuronal subtypes,
genome-wide interrogation of regulatory networks, modern circuit-tracing methods, comparative
analyses in multiple vertebrate organisms, and rigorous analyses of behavior. Elucidating the basic
mechanisms of motor circuit assembly will provide foundational insights relevant to the design of
therapeutic strategies to treat degenerative diseases of spinal neurons or repair motor circuits
damaged by injury."

The research proposed in the R00 phase will be conducted in the Department of Neuroscience at Yale University School of Medicine. The project description has been updated to reflect changes in the research from the original submission.
The ability to remember past personal happenings to guide proper behavior and make correct decisions is essential to our everyday life. Memory transience observed in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease has severe afflicting implications. Hippocampal circuits have long been posited to mediate spatial information necessary for episodic memory processes. At the cellular level, a striking and behaviorally relevant form of spatial information can be found in the receptive fields of CA1 place cells which collectively produce a representation of the external world. However, it remains unknown how hippocampal circuits operate to give rise to these representations, coordinate their output at the population level and broadcast this information to the rest of the brain. Addressing these questions would serve as a major step towards a deeper mechanistic understanding of the hippocampus and allow for the development of targeted approaches to prevent the devastating consequences of hippocampal circuit dysfunctions in various brain disorders.
In this proposal, I will leverage new electrophysiological, imaging, tracing and optogenetics methods to interrogate the functional organization of hippocampal circuits across multiple scales in awake behaving mice. The research plan is organized in three aims, split across a K99 training phase and a R00 independent phase. In the first aim (K99), I will initiate monosynaptic retrograde rabies tracing from a single CA1 neuron and record the activity of its inhibitory presynaptic partners with volumetric random access 2-photon calcium imaging during behavior. This will allow me to directly test the contribution of local inhibition on sculpting the input/output function of individual pyramidal cells. In the second aim (K99/R00), I will use patterned optogenetics manipulations with single-cell precision to produce network wide circuit maps between principal neurons and distinct inhibitory cell types. I will use it to identify core circuit motifs shaping the CA1 network structure and regulating the circuit’s specialized operations. In the R00 portion of the award, I will test whether the local organization of CA1 circuits helps dispatching and transferring spatial representations to brain regions downstream of the hippocampus.
During the K99 phase, the work was conducted in the Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute at Columbia University under the supervision of Drs. Attila Losonczy, Stefano Fusi, Liam Paninski, Darcy Peterka and Ashok Litwin-Kumar."

This K01 award will launch Dr. Kerry Kinney’s independent research career focused on reducing disparities in
the diagnosis and treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). GAD is the most common anxiety disorder
in primary care settings, where the rate of GAD misdiagnosis is estimated at 67-71%. Misdiagnosis can delay
treatment, exacerbate chronicity, and increase personal and societal costs. GAD misdiagnosis appears
especially high in those marginalized by systemic inequality, leading to disparities in access to quality GAD
treatment. The proposed K01 research leverages large-scale, epidemiologic and electronic health record (EHR)
datasets to evaluate two potential contributors to GAD diagnostic disparities: 1) psychometric bias, or indications
that GAD’s diagnostic criteria fail to capture the same construct across sociodemographic groups or over time,
and 2) disparities in patient-centered care, which is characterized by collaborative decision-making and
respecting patients’ values, culture, and context. To accomplish Aim 1, Dr. Kinney will assess for the presence
of measurement non-invariance and differential item functioning (indicators of psychometric bias) in GAD
symptom criteria across racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups and over time in epidemiologic datasets. To
accomplish Aim 2, Dr. Kinney will employ natural language processing in EHR data to identify language indicative
of non-patient-centered care in primary care notes. She will assess how non-patient-centered care relates to
sociodemographic factors and GAD diagnosis. Dr. Kinney proposes to build upon her strong foundational training
by targeting career development in: 1) specialized research skills needed for responsibly and ethically conducting
health disparities research; 2) advanced quantitative modeling to enhance theoretical models of GAD and clarify
the role of social determinants of health in GAD diagnosis; 3) the technical biomedical informatics and textual
analysis skills necessary to harness EHR data for health disparities research; and 4) grant-writing skills to obtain
independent extramural funding. Dr. Kinney has assembled a highly qualified, interdisciplinary team of mentors,
collaborators, and consultants to support her in achieving these training aims. Collectively, the proposed mentor
and co-mentor (Drs. Matthew Morris and Ashley Watts), collaborators (Drs. Glenn Gobbel, Mohammed Al-
Garadi, and David Cole), and consultants (Drs. Katja Beesdo-Baum, Matthew Diemer, and Siddharth Pratap)
provide the optimal combination of expertise to facilitate the successful completion of the proposed research and
training plan and launch Dr. Kinney’s independent research career. The research and training aims will occur in
the exceptional, multidisciplinary, resource-rich environment at Vanderbilt University. This K01 award will support
Dr. Kinney in establishing an independent research program that aims to elucidate the mechanisms underlying
disparities in the identification and treatment of GAD. The project’s goals are strongly aligned with NIMHD’s
scientific priorities to understand and address factors underlying disparities in health services."

Transfer RNA (tRNA) is best known to function in ribosome-mediated protein synthesis. However, in a
less known role, arginyl-tRNA is essential for catalyzing a unique and poorly understood protein post-
translational modification, namely arginylation, that regulates protein turnover. In this arginylation reaction,
ATE1 (Arginyltransferase 1) facilitates arginine transfer to protein targets using a mechanism that
depends on, and is selective for, arginyl-tRNA(Arg) as the donor cofactor. ATE1-mediated protein
arginylation was identified on hundreds of proteins and is recognized as a global regulator of eukaryotic
cellular processes, including embryogenesis, stress responses, and aging. Deregulation of ATE1 is found
in patients with Parkinson’s disease and metastatic prostate, liver, and skin cancers. Nonetheless, how
ATE1 (and other aminoacyl-tRNA transferases) hijacks tRNA from the highly efficient ribosomal protein
synthesis pathways and catalyzes the arginylation reaction remains a mystery. This proposal aims to
elucidate the catalytic mechanism and regulation of ATE1-mediated protein arginylation in vitro and in
cells. We will focus on interrogating the activity of ATE1 and the consequences of arginylation at three
scales. Firstly, we will determine the molecular mechanisms ATE1 selects for arginyl-tRNA(Arg) and
recognizes specific sites in protein targets through an integrative approach combining structural,
biochemical, and biophysical methods. Once determined, this research will allow a better understanding
of the growing classes of aminoacyl-tRNA transferases in general. Secondly, we will quantitatively
determine the consequences of arginylation on target protein turnover in living cells. Protein degradation
usually depends on poly-ubiquitination, a downstream or concurrent event following arginylation, and
through either proteasomal or autophagy-lysosomal pathways. By examining specific model substrates
for proteasome or autophagosome under normal or stressed conditions, we will determine the crosstalk
between arginylation and ubiquitination; delineate the contribution of each degradation pathway; reveal
the kinetics in cells. Lastly, we will investigate whether and how core components of the ribosomal
translation machinery and nutrients affect protein arginylation. Mechanistically, these studies will expand
our knowledge of the regulatory roles of amino acids and tRNAs, enrich our toolbox to study
macromolecule regulation by tRNA-dependent aminoacylation, and reshape how we consider the
functions of the charged tRNAs beyond protein synthesis. Together, this research provides fundamental
knowledge about arginylation, lays the groundwork for discovering novel therapeutic strategies by
modulating ATE1 activity and protein arginylation in Parkinson’s disease and metastatic cancers, and
enables us to build integrative platforms for future research."

 Actomyosin-based force generation sculpts tissues into a remarkable array of shapes during
development. Successful tissue sculpting requires that actomyosin is precisely regulated and that the
resulting force patterns are transmitted across the tissue. Force transmission itself affects contractile
signaling, resulting in emergent behaviors that result in tissue shape change.
 We have demonstrated the role of dynamic RhoA-GTPase cycling in generating actomyosin
pulses and waves in Drosophila gastrulation and oogenesis, respectively. In each of these cases, we
identified a Rho GTPase activating protein (RhoGAP) that is required for cycling behavior and
demonstrates the functional importance for the cycling in morphogenesis. Our work has demonstrated
the requirement of RhoGTPase cycling in tissue invagination and the completion of cytoplasmic
transport from germline support cells to the oocyte. The mechanisms that initiate these dynamic
behaviors and how they are influenced by force transmission in a tissue are still unknown.
 Patterns of force transmission in a tissue are complex and extremely dynamic. We have
identified the importance of supracellular actomyosin meshworks in transmitting forces between
hundreds of cells in a tissue, which forms chains of mechanically interconnected cells. Supracellular
actomyosin meshworks within epithelia can exhibit biased connections, which influence tissue
mechanics. But, how a cell determines which neighbors to link to is unknown and critical to understand
tissue shape. Furthermore, the cell biological mechanisms that dissipate forces in response to
morphogenetic movements and how they are coordinated with movement are poorly understood.
 We will undertake a multidisciplinary and multiscale approach to understand tissue shape
emergence. Combining our ability to visualize and perturb dynamic signaling pathways we will
investigate the interconnection between forces `felt' by cells and resulting single cell signaling patterns
with the goal of bridging molecular and tissue scales. Members of my lab include biologists, physicists,
and engineers. In addition, we have excellent collaborators in Mathematics to supplement our research
capabilities. We are poised to make additional important contributions to our understanding of how
collective cell behaviors contribute to morphogenesis."

 Organisms that reproduce sexually utilize a specialized cell division program called meiosis to reduce their
chromosome number by half to generate haploid gametes. Proper execution of this process is crucial for a
successful pregnancy, since errors in meiotic chromosome segregation result in aneuploidy (incorrect
chromosome number in the embryos), the leading known cause of miscarriages and birth defects in humans.
Meiosis in females is especially error prone and this vulnerability has a profound impact on human health: it is
estimated that 10-25% of human embryos are chromosomally abnormal, and the vast majority of these defects
arise from problems with the female meiotic cells (called oocytes). However, despite the importance of female
meiosis for successful reproduction and human health, surprisingly little is known about the mechanisms that act
to ensure accurate chromosome partitioning in oocytes.
 Oocytes have some special features that necessitate the use of novel cell division mechanisms. Perhaps
most significantly, oocytes lack centrosomes, which define and organize the spindle poles in other cell types;
therefore, spindles in these cells must assemble using different mechanisms. Using C. elegans as a model, we
previously demonstrated that acentrosomal spindle assembly proceeds by 1) nucleation/stabilization of
microtubules adjacent to the disassembling nuclear envelope, 2) sorting of microtubules such that their minus
ends are positioned at the periphery of the array, 3) organization of these ends into nascent poles, and 4)
coalescence of these sites until bipolarity is achieved. Moreover, we have identified proteins required for key
events in this pathway, shedding light on the molecular mechanisms underlying this form of spindle assembly.
 Building on these discoveries, the goals of the proposed work are to: 1) deepen our understanding of
acentrosomal spindle assembly and organization, and 2) investigate mechanisms that promote the formation
and stability of acentrosomal spindle poles in both C. elegans and mammalian oocytes. These approaches will
enable us to gain a mechanistic understanding of oocyte meiosis, an important yet poorly understood form of
specialized cell division."

Older sexual and gender minorities (SGM) living with HIV have a 100-fold higher risk for anal cancer and are
more likely to be diagnosed with advanced stages of anal cancer with less favorable prognoses, highlighting the
importance of engaging older SGM in anal cancer prevention programs. In Nigeria, men 45 years of age or older
have some of the highest prevalences of HIV, yet they are the most difficult age demographic to recruit into our
anal cancer prevention study, the Integrated Model for the Prevention of Anal Cancer using screen and Treat for
HSIL (IMPACT) study. Only 15% (22/146) of SGM ≥40 years of age who provided their contact information
engaged with our anal cancer prevention program since its launch 8 months ago. The IMPACT research team
noted privacy concerns, socioeconomic class barriers, reluctance to engage with younger SGM at the clinic, and
varying levels of health knowledge as factors contributing to low enrollment of older SGM in anal cancer
screening. To ensure the success of our anal cancer prevention program, participation of older SGM—as the
highest risk group that is likely to benefit the most—is crucial. To better understand how to promote anal cancer
prevention among older SGM, we propose the Engaging LeaDERS (ELDERS) study to elicit the viewpoints and
preferences that older Nigerian SGM living with HIV use when deciding to engage in cancer screening. We
hypothesize that tailoring anal cancer prevention strategies to address culturally relevant barriers and
preferences of older SGM will enhance health-seeking behavior and promote sustainability of anal cancer
prevention programs among this high-risk population in Nigeria. We will use implementation research strategies
to evaluate barriers and enablers to engaging with anal cancer prevention among older SGM. We will also identify
preferences that contribute to the decision-making process among older SGM with respect to accessing anal
cancer prevention. Our study aims will include qualitative and quantitative assessments that embrace community
feedback and our strong partnerships with the SGM community in Nigeria. The information gained from ELDERS
will be applied to improve the recruitment of older SGM within IMPACT as well as the development of a future
Discrete Choice Experiment to improve and sustain anal cancer prevention efforts among older SGM in Nigeria
more broadly."

Many of the molecular mechanisms underlying well-characterized robust and rapidly inducible transcriptional
responses are shared among other systems, so we use hormone-induced transcriptional responses to study
gene regulation. We use rapid kinetic regulation and perturbation of transcription cascades, transcription
factors, and cofactors to identify key mechanisms, genes, and regulatory elements that are critical for hormone
signaling. Transcription factors act as activators or repressors and interface with a constellation of accessory
cofactors to regulate distinct steps in the transcription to coordinate gene expression, but the molecular
functions of the vast majority of transcription factors remain uncharacterized. We use molecular genomics
assays and computational methods to classify transcription factors by their molecular function, as opposed to
broad activator and repressor classes, in order to understand the context specificity of gene regulation. We
found that the estrogen receptor transcription factor may compete with other transcription factors for limiting
cofactors to mediate estrogen-induced repression. We will develop genetic tools to uncouple activation and
repression to test various models of repression, such as squelching cofactors from repressed genes. The
genes and regulatory elements that are downstream of the first wave of transcriptional response are critical for
propagating regulatory cascades. We generate high resolution, genome-wide time course data of regulatory
element activity and nascent transcription upon stimulation of differentiation processes. We construct
mechanistically interpretable networks to identify effector genes and regulatory elements that are critical for
signaling in regulatory cascades. Our research reveals basic principles and rules that govern transcription
factor specificity in order to understand how genetics, nutrition, and environmental factors contribute to
variation in transcriptional programs that can lead to disease states or ineffective therapies."

 The parent R01 grant has quantified numerous obstetrical and perinatal health disparities among sex-
ual minority women (SMW; e.g., those with same-sex attractions, same-sex behavior, and/or lesbian/gay/bi-
sexual identity) and their offspring compared to their heterosexual counterparts using data from unique, pro-
spective, intergenerational cohorts—the Nurses' Health Studies and Growing Up Today Study. Documented
disparities include adverse perinatal mental health—a known contributor to adverse obstetrical and perinatal
outcomes. Yet, due to small sample sizes and other methodological limitations, little is known about the mech-
anisms that drive SMW's perinatal mental health inequities and how this may influence subsequent health in-
equities. When forming biological and/or genetic families, many SMW in same-sex couples require specialized
fertility services due to a lack of sperm within their relationship. However, negative and discriminating experi-
ences, lack of provider knowledge, and barriers to accessing care are common experiences among SMW fertil-
ity patients. Additionally, undergoing fertility care can be emotionally and financially distressing, and SMW are
more likely to have a history of mental illness—a risk factor for perinatal mental illness. Given these considera-
tions, it is prudent to understand SMW's preconception mental health and if the role of structural antecedents
to the perinatal period (e.g., fertility care experiences) may uniquely influence SMW's adverse perinatal mental
health. Consequently, this research will help identify whether promoting positive patient experiences and men-
tal health during fertility care may serve as a critical intervention point for this population. To address these
gaps, the proposed aims of this community-placed, mixed methods study are to 1) elucidate the patient experi-
ence of fertility care among SMW and their partners in same-sex couples and 2) develop best practices for in-
clusive family formation data collection in the Nurses' Health Studies and Growing Up Today Study. We will
achieve these aims by conducting online semi-structured interviews, quantitative assessments of mental health
and patient experiences, and family formation timelines—an established graphical elicitation method that pro-
motes the report of temporal narratives through the co-creation of research data. This project will produce the
first investigation of the patient experience of fertility care among SMW across the U.S. It will also be among
the first best practices developed for accurately collecting inclusive family formation data in large population-
based surveys. This work will have a positive impact on the field of SMW's perinatal health by identifying po-
tential mechanisms of adverse preconception mental health and, subsequently, adverse perinatal and obstetri-
cal outcomes. Additionally, this work will reconceptualize how fertility research is conducted to accurately char-
acterize and measure health-related inequities among diverse families and enable subsequent R01 proposals
from our team and others to advance the science of perinatal health inequities among minoritized populations."

 Dementia poses a significant challenge in the US, with one in three older adults living with the
condition. This reality not only incurs staggering healthcare costs, exceeding $345 billion annually, but also
imposes considerable socio-economic and psycho-social burdens on People Living with Dementia (PLWD)
and their 11 million unpaid care partners. In this landscape, AI-assisted robot technology (AIAR) emerges as a
promising solution, offering to enhance care and improve the quality of life for PLWD and their care partners by
enabling them to age safely at home. However, the integration of AIAR into dementia care requires navigating
a complex ethical landscape, especially concerning the preservation of dignity (concerns around
dehumanization) and autonomy (privacy and consent), which interact in the engagement of PLWD in the
continuous decision-making of AIAR assisted care. Current AIAR implementation often marginalizes PLWD in
decision-making processes due to societal perceptions and stigma, which imply that PLWD lacks the capacity
for meaningful decision-making. A care partner's intimate understanding of the PLWD's history, preferences,
and personality is vital for interpreting subtle cues and enhancing communication, especially as cognitive
abilities fluctuate. However, this understanding can also impede autonomy if care partners presume to know
the PLWD's wishes without involving them in the decision-making process, showing the significance of
supporting care partners to learn to engage PLWD in making decisions.
Our study aims to address this issue by aligning AIAR technology with person-centered dementia care (PCC)
through a two-stage approach. Aim 1 (Stage 0): Describe Experiences of PLWD, Care partners, and AIAR
Developers with AIAR Implementation in Everyday Care Context. Adopting in-depth interviews and non-
participant observations guided by our conceptual framework, we will describe the experiences, related ethical
complexities, and decision-making processes associated with AIAR usage. We will also identify features of the
AIAR that both impede and facilitate collaborative decision making. Aim 2 (Stage 1a): Co-Design a Robust
Intervention Protocol with Preliminary Feasibility and Acceptability. We will engage key stakeholders and expert
panels to co-design an ethically informed intervention model that demonstrates preliminary feasibility and
acceptability, setting the stage for subsequent efficacy testing and a pragmatic clinical trial involving PLWD-care
partner dyads and AIAR systems. The intervention model aims to prioritize the dignity and autonomy of PLWD
and enhance collaborative decision-making. The study holds the potential to direct dementia care towards a
future where technology is utilized with respect, integrity, and a profound understanding of human dignity and
autonomy, thereby ensuring the ethical and effective integration of AIAR in dementia care."
11030989,"Growing evidence suggests the contribution of altered brain microcirculation to cognitive impairment and dementia observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-related dementia (ADRD). Yet, the lack of approaches to image and investigate the function of the small cerebrovasculature has hampered our progress in understanding the pathological sequence of vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). The earliest signs of AD and VCID in patients and mouse models typically involve deficits in cerebral blood flow. Specifically, neurons lack energy reserves and thus rely on a “just-in-time” neurovascular coupling (NVC) strategy in which active regions signal to the microvasculature to locally dilate and increase local blood flow. Patients and mouse models of AD or CADASIL, a monogenic archetypal form of VCID, show an early deterioration in NVC. Our previous studies have identified a molecular defect at play in capillary endothelial cells: depletion of phospholipid PIP2 prevents Kir2.1 channels to act as sensors of increases in external K+ — a product of neuronal activity — and transduce this into a vasodilator electrical signal that rapidly propagates to upstream arterioles, driving vasodilation and local hyperemia. We further linked PIP2 depletion to a lower ATP/ADP ratio (i.e., phosphorylation potential) in CADASIL capillary endothelium. Our multidisciplinary team, with complementary expertise in cutting-edge imaging of brain microcirculation and bioenergetic approaches, will test the hypothesis that alterations in the extracellular matrix inhibit autocrine activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and lower ATP production in CADASIL but also in presence on Aβ oligomers. We further propose to investigate this pathomechanism in humans using freshly isolated brain microvessels paired with spatial and single cell transcriptomics in human autopsy brain tissue. To attain this goal, we will engage a wide variety of novel, state-of-the-art experimental approaches using intact animals, native tissue, and freshly isolated cells, complemented by sophisticated multi-omics analysis. Aim 1 will investigate Aβ- induced metabolic impairment in capillary endothelial cells in cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) over time. Using extracellular matrix disruptions characteristic of CADASIL as a framework, Aim 2 will elucidate the mechanism by which EGFR inhibition impairs mitochondrial function in capillary endothelium. Finally, Aim3 will create an integrated view of the pathological role of EGFR inhibition and endothelial energetic impairment in in AD/ADRD by investigating this pathway in CAA and AD. The proposed work has the potential to provide a paradigm-shifting view on how capillary endothelial cell energetics control neurovascular coupling, and as such, should provide the foundation for understanding VCID development that is necessary to identify novel efficacious therapeutic strategies."

operating as a major node. We propose a program of research that will use models and data to make
significant contributions to the body of evidence that informs prevention and control of healthcare-associated
infections due to antibiotic-resistant pathogens. In the CDC’s 2019 Antibiotic Resistance Threat Report, it was
estimated that the burden of resistant infections, including Clostridioides difficile, exceeded 3 million cases per
year, with approximately 48,000 deaths. Two of the urgent threats listed in CDC’s Threat Report –
carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and carbapenem resistant Acinetobacter – and four of the serious
threats – extended spectrum beta lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin resistant enterococci, and multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa
– are directly addressed in our proposal.
Our proposal includes two tightly interwoven and complementary projects that tackle key controversies in
infection control and antibiotic stewardship, highlighting the role that dynamic models can play in healthcare
epidemiology. Project 1 uses the distinction between horizontal and vertical infection control strategies as a
framework to systematically evaluate interventions to prevent transmission, ranging from the level of a hospital
room to the region level, with multiple connected facilities. Project 1 powerfully leverages the model, data, and
results generated by the CDC-funded ""Granular Modeling – Simulating the Transmission of Healthcare-
Associated Infections in Hospitals and Control Strategies"" project. For Aim 1.1, we will use our agent based
model, which has detailed representation of transmission components, to simulate trials of horizontal
interventions. For Aim 1.2 we will use a blend of mathematical theory and data analysis to assess the facility-
level impact of vertical control strategies across a range of surveillance and cohorting scenarios. For Aim 1.3
we will use a multi-facility framework to model the effects of combinations of horizontal and vertical
interventions across multiple pathogens and perform cost-effectiveness analyses that account for indirect
population-level effects due to transmission reduction. Project 2 leverages the immense data resources
associated with the VA health system’s electronic health records to examine the effect of antibiotic selection
pressure on antibiotic resistance profiles for a broad set of high priority pathogens. We will test hypotheses
derived from evolutionary models about the impact of co-selection and about the temporal relationships
between changes in antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance. We will also apply multivariate time series
methods and empirical dynamic modeling to forecast and explain trends in resistance. Our goal is to improve
understanding of why some forms of bacterial resistance are decreasing, others are increasing, and others are
at relative equilibrium."

hands on focus, and mentoring. Dr. Moore’s interdisciplinary mentors include researchers with achievements in
breast cancer disparities research, cancer health communication through community-based participatory
research, qualitative and mixed methods approaches as indicated through their multiply funded NIH awards.
Further, their expertise will provide the necessary support for the career development and research activities of
the study proposed in this application by Dr. Moore.
The proposed research will provide valuable insight to the field of breast cancer disparities and address key
public health questions of relevance to racial and geographic disparities in breast cancer using innovative
analytical methods. It will combine Dr. Moore’s expertise in spatial and cancer epidemiology with the mentors’
expertise in large intervention studies on breast cancer, health communication and community-based
participatory research, and mixed-methods analysis to understand the individual, interpersonal, community
facilitators of mammography screening among minority (Hispanic and Black) women living in the highest risk
communities of the United States. The research includes specific aims that be will achieved using
interdisciplinary research methods including Bayesian methodology for small-area estimates of mammography
screening, semi-structured interviews, and survey research among those recruited within the pilot study. The
aims include: (1) identifying areas of low mammography screening among Black and Hispanic women using
novel small-area estimation; 2) quantifying a novel index of high-risk counties for breast cancer among Blacks
and Hispanics, and 3) performing a pilot study among Black and Hispanic women, stratified among the novel
index, to understand the personal, interpersonal, and community barriers on intentions to receiving
mammography screening. Through the proposed research the investigator will understand culturally specific
barriers and develop a strong rapport within high-risk communities using a community-based approach that will
provide a foundation to develop a larger longitudinal study with sustainable interventions."

environmental exposures that influence cognitive aging at older ages. This training and research plan will
facilitate the transition to an independent researcher in the field of life course research, social genomics, and
Alzheimer's Diseases and Related Dementias (ADRD) for Dr. Mateo Farina. He received his Ph.D. in
Sociology (Demography Emphasis) from the University of Texas at Austin where he researched the life course
origins of dementia onset among Blacks and Whites in the United States. As an NIA-supported postdoctoral
fellow at the Davis School of Gerontology at the University of Southern California (USC), he has begun to
incorporate biomarkers into his work and will now expand these to include epigenetic markers.
 Epigenetics, which is defined as measures based on DNA methylation and the RNA transcriptome, can
have a significant impact on cognitive aging. Not only can epigenetics effect brain structure during
development (i.e., lower hippocampal volume), but also it can influence brain pathology (i.e. increased
amyloid). Through these biological pathways, the risk of poor cognitive aging outcomes, such as cognitive
impairment, increases. This connection to brain health has made epigenetics potentially important for the study
of ADRD. Epigenetics is also greatly influenced by life experiences. As such, it is an important biosocial
mechanism that can be examined to evaluate how life course exposures impact cognitive aging. The proposed
research will push the aging field forward by: 1) advancing our understanding of how epigenetics are
associated with cognitive aging across multiple measures of cognitive functioning and change, 2) investigate
the epigenetic-based biosocial pathways that link lifetime social and environmental exposures to cognitive
aging and 3) understanding how epigenetics may lead to downstream physiological dysregulation that has
been linked to poor cognitive health.
 The proposed research uses the newly released DNA methylation data and the soon-to-be released
RNA transcriptome data in the Health and Retirement Study. This data, along with the rich information on
cognition and social and economic conditions throughout life, make it possible to examine the epigenetic
mechanisms linking life course exposures and their timing to cognitive aging in a large, diverse nationally
representative population. USC provides the ideal training environment to undertake this research given the
multidisciplinary nature of the School of Gerontology, expertise in cognitive aging, and several didactic options
for training in epigenetic methods. This training will prepare the PI to submit an R01 proposal as a junior
tenure-track professor."

 Cell-specific drug delivery represents one of the most important research areas in the field of drug delivery.
Particularly, there are formidable challenges for in vivo mRNA delivery. For example, therapeutic window for
current delivery systems is relatively narrow. A large number of cell types cannot be efficiently delivered in vivo.
Biodegradability of the delivery materials remains a concern. In order to address the challenges, the goals of our
research program are: 1) to develop diverse lipid derivatives; 2) to construct mRNA delivery systems; 3) to
examine the delivery efficiency, pharmacokinetics, and safety profile of these systems in animal models. In our
preliminary studies, we developed functionalized lipid-like nanoparticles for in vivo mRNA delivery and base
editing. The lead material was able to produce human factor VIII at a normal physiological level in hemophilia A
mice. The effective base editing was also achieved at low doses in mice. Meanwhile, we constructed vitamin
derived lipid nanoparticles, which enabled adoptive macrophage transfer for eliminating multidrug resistant (MDR)
bacteria in mouse models. Moreover, we showed promising mRNA delivery in other cell types, such as stem
cells and reproductive cells. Additionally, we systematically investigated the untranslated regions (UTRs) of
mRNAs in order to enhance protein production. Through a comprehensive analysis of endogenous gene
expression and de novo design of UTRs, we identified an optimal combination of 5' and 3' UTR, termed as
NASAR, which was significantly more efficient than the tested endogenous UTRs. These preliminary data
provide the scientific foundation to address the delivery challenges of mRNA-based therapeutics. In this proposal,
we propose four directions for mRNA delivery in vivo: (1) to optimize N1,N3,N5-tris(2-aminoethyl)benzene-1,3,5-
tricarboxamide (TT) lipid derivatives for hepatocytes delivery; (2) to investigate vitamin lipid derivatives for
macrophages delivery; (3) to develop glycolipid derivatives for stem cells delivery; (4) to conceive novel lipid
derivatives for reproductive cells delivery. We will prove the concept of cell-specific delivery systems in animal
models. Our research goal is to translate the innovations of this research strategy to develop better mRNA
delivery tools to treat diverse diseases."

11034174,"Project Summary/Abstract
The intestinal microbiota plays a major role in human health and is therefore the focus of significant interest as
a target for therapeutic interventions. However, our understanding at the mechanistic level of the ecological
and evolutionary forces shaping this diverse and densely colonized ecosystem is still tenuous. Notably,
although we know that horizontal gene transfer is pervasive in the gut community, we understand only
superficially the different roles of the majority of these exchanged genes and how this repertoire affects
community dynamics. Similarly, little is known about the mechanisms underlying community resiliency. This
question is particularly intriguing for the Bacteroidales, the most abundant Gram-negative gut microbiome
members, which can stably colonize for decades. This proposal will investigate the importance of biofilm
formation by the Bacteroidales for community ecology and resilience, focusing on the conjugative
megaplasmid pMMCAT which enables biofilm formation in the strains that acquire it. This plasmid is
exceptional because of the high frequency of intrapersonal transfer to multiple Bacteroidales species and its
ubiquity, with conserved architecture, across global human populations. Some studies suggest that mucosal
biofilms in healthy humans are rare, but there is little information about other locations or unattached biofilms. I
hypothesize that this megaplasmid, shared among many species in a community, enables the formation of
multi-species biofilms and plays a role in community cooperation, notably through increasing community
resilience. To test this hypothesis, or otherwise understand alternative roles of pMMCAT, I will systematically
characterize the phenotypes conferred by this plasmid in culture and in gnotobiotic mice in a single strain (aim
1) or in different Bacteroidales consortia where some strains carry it (aim 2). To understand the ecological role
of pMMCAT, I will evaluate if its conferred phenotypes are synergized or inhibited by the co-resident strains
and whether all, only some, or none of the other strains benefit. To visualize biofilms in the colon prior to and
following a stress pulse, I will use two different methods to preserve the spatial structure of the gut community
and use a biofilm matrix-specific stain. I will subsequently examine the evolutionary dynamics of pMMCAT
transfer in these consortia (aim 3). To this end, I will directly quantify and visualize plasmid transfer in culture
and in a gnotobiotic mouse. I will also quantify the cost of carrying pMMCAT and expressing biofilm formation
genes. I will evaluate the impact of the introduction of a cheater strain that doesn’t pay this fitness cost of
producing the biofilm matrix public good. Finally, I will track the evolution of pMMCAT over the course of twelve
years in four human volunteers previously found to have pMMCAT-harboring strains. This dissection of the
dynamics and mechanisms underlying plasmid-encoded biofilm formation in the gut will improve our current
understanding of intestinal ecology and its recent changes in human populations, and will provide one more
stepping stone towards targeted microbiome interventions for health benefits."
11034622,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The health and life outcomes of individuals are intertwined with the context in which they grow and live. The
totality of exposures one experiences affects health in the short term and throughout the life course.
Environmental exposure to multiple contaminants can increase stress levels in individuals and neighborhoods
with psychosocial stressors such as crime, drug, and alcohol misuse, and violence also taking a toll on
individual and neighborhood wellbeing. In addition, the availability, organization, and quality of local
institutions and infrastructure all affect health in the short and long term.
Individuals are vulnerable to simultaneous exposure to an array of environmental and psychosocial stressors.
Exposure to environmental pollutants such as lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), perfluorooctane
sulfonic acid (PFOS), and perfluorinated alkylated substances (PFOA) are independently associated with
adverse health outcomes, but little is known about their combined effect on individual and neighborhood
stress, cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk and CVD mortality.
Exploring how diverse environmental pollutants combine to cause adverse health outcomes for individuals and
neighborhoods is critical for promoting healthier longer lives among populations in the United States.
Contextualized in the life course theory, our study seeks to close the gap in the literature on exposure to
multiple contaminants to understand the combined effect of Pb, Cd, Hg, PFOS, and PFOA on (a) allostatic load,
a measure of chronic individual stress, (b) Cumulative census track risk of psychosocial stress (CCRPS), a
measure of neighborhood stress, CVD risk and CVD mortality. We hypothesize that multiple environmental
exposures will increase individual and neighborhood level stress, CVD risk, CVD mortality.
It is critical to understand the extent to which the combined effect of Pb, Cd, Hg, PFOS, and PFOA affect the
outcomes in this study. Specifically, study results can be addressed through interventions for the most at risk to
limit combinations of exposures to these contaminants. Study findings will produce modified data analytical
techniques for modeling the combined effects of exposures while accounting for survey data design. In addition
to its implications on health, this project, we will attract and train students, especially those from historically
excluded student populations i.e., Black and Hispanic, to conduct research in environmental epidemiology and
data analytics. In sum, the proposed research project will enhance the current understanding of the impact of
multiple environmental pollutants on individual and neighborhood stress, CVD risk and mortality; this will
expand the research capacity at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, the nation’s largest
HBCU, which is perfectly aligned with the goals of the SuRE program."
11034616,"Project Summary
Tight junctions (TJs) at the boundaries of endothelial and epithelial cells are critical in the development and
function of vertebrates because they enable these tissues to separate, protect, and shape external epidermis
and limbs and internal organs and glands. TJs regulate molecular transport through the spaces between
individual cells (paracellular) while adhering cellular sheets. TJs perform two vital functions in tissues: 1) form
barriers to restrict paracellular flux of small molecules, protecting organisms from the external environment and
separating internal body compartments; and 2) creating size- and charge-selective pores, allowing permeability
of ions that maintain electrochemical gradients. Numerous proteins amass at TJs to form the macromolecular
assemblies necessary for barrier and pore function. But two families of membrane proteins—claudins and
TAMPs (TJ-associated Marvel proteins)—predominate TJ assembly, architecture, and function. As these TJ
integral membrane proteins (TJIMPs) are the sole components to span intracellular, intramembraneous, and
extracellular space, they act as cytoskeletal scaffolds and assemble side-by-side within a membrane (cis) and
with TJIMPs from adjacent cell membranes (trans) to form barriers and pores. The molecular structure of TJs
is dynamic. Changes in protein composition, interaction, conformation, or modification—useful for assembling
TJs to precisely tune paracellular transport under normal conditions—can also be mis-assembled, resulting in
pathologies such as cancer, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, Huntington’s, ALS, stroke, food poisoning and
inflammatory bowel disease, renal wasting, hepatitis, and diseases of the skin, eyes, and ears. Molecular level
insights into TJ structure and dynamics; the mechanisms of assembly that govern barrier and pore function;
and how disabling these mechanisms leads to pathologies, remain unresolved matters in our fundamental
understanding of TJs. We propose here a comprehensive research program that uses highly interdisciplinary
approaches to determine structure–interaction–function relationships between TJIMPs at dynamic TJ
microenvironments. These approaches integrate structural biology of TJIMPs and their complexes with
information obtained by traditional and state-of-the-art bioinformatics, biochemical, biophysical, and functional
experiments. The research program intends to resolve the underlying molecular principles of TJ assembly and
disassembly by confronting technical challenges and, in the near-term, by answering specific questions on
TJIMP interaction networks, the basis of gut barrier breakdown by a bacterial toxin, and the mechanisms of
TJIMP form and function at the blood-brain barrier. The long-term goal of our laboratory is to elucidate the
molecular bases for construction, destruction, and reconstruction of TJs, occurring both naturally or via
disease-causing mechanisms, and to use the achieved insights to advance design and development of novel
therapeutics to remedy TJ-related ailments."

11034329,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The latent period after a severe brain insult such as traumatic brain injury or status epilepticus, and before the
onset of spontaneous recurrent seizures, is characterized by changes in adult hippocampal neurogenesis.
Profound morphological changes, including hilar ectopic granule cells and abnormal dendritic development (e.g.,
hilar basal dendrites) is observed, therefore raising the question whether seizure- induced neurogenesis is
epileptogenic. Our past work of ablating adult neurogenesis before or after acute seizures has shown a pro-
epileptic role of new neurons, however existing ablation strategies in animal models have all suffered from an
inability to decipher the mechanisms that promote aberrant adult-born granule cells (abGCs) because the cells
are removed from the circuit. In this supplement, we will capitalize on recently published work from our laboratory
demonstrating that activity in immature abGCs regulates Ca2+ and gene expression which is necessary and
sufficient for the production of aberrant abGCs and disruption of the hippocampal circuitry leading to epilepsy.
We propose work to determine the mechanisms that promote aberrant neurogenesis, focusing on the genes and
signaling pathways that drive aberrant abGCs as well as identifying the neuronal inputs to the aberrant abGCs.
In this Diversity Supplement, we will perform new experiments to expand the scope of Aim 1 of the parent R01
application, which is to determine the function of previously identified hM4Di-identified genes in aberrant
neurogenesis and seizure. The proposed project will use human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and 3D neural
organoids to examine the role of TIMP3, a tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase, by using a small molecule
to knockdown its expression. These studies are expected to provide a greater understanding of the mechanisms
that promote aberrant neurogenesis, which may offer new strategies to specifically target abnormal new neurons
while sparing healthy ones. These studies would be broadly impactful in a variety of neurological disorders
including epilepsy."
11034644,"SUMMARY
Over the past decade(s), research has highlighted that substrate stiffness and architecture/topography can be
recognized by cells and serve as mechanical and topographical cues that ultimately drive cell behavior through
mechanoreceptors. Substrate changes can also affect the mechanical stimulation of cells and thus their
response to loading. These cell responses are largely governed through mechanosensitive ion channels, such
as the transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. TRPV4 is of specific interest as its activation and expression
can be affected by matrix stiffness and topography. Furthermore, its activation controls extracellular matrix
(ECM) synthesis, matrix-degrading enzyme expression, and ECM remodeling in various cell types.
The annulus fibrosus (AF), the outer area of the intervertebral disc (IVD), is a mechanosensitive tissue in which
topographical and mechanical cues change during degeneration, thus likely affecting cell fate, cellular activity,
and disease progression. The AF plays a crucial role in the development of
low back pain as its structural failure
can lead to IVD
herniation.
Surprisingly, only very few studies have thus far investigated cell-substrate
interactions in AF cells and no data exists on the relevance of substrate stiffness/topography on TRPV4 activation
in AF cells. It is also unknown whether TRPV4 regulates ECM synthesis/remodeling in the AF, which would, in
turn, affect its activation and hence create a crucial feedback loop.
Our long-term goal is to reveal the relevance of cell-substrate processes in IVD health and disease and to use
this knowledge in the development of regenerative approaches. Specifically, this project aims to: (1) Determine
the relevance of substrate stiffness on TRPV4 activation in AF cells in response to (a) a pharmacological TRPV4
agonist and (b) cyclic stretching. (2) Determine the relevance of substrate topography on TRPV4 activation in
AF cells in response to (a) a pharmacological TRPV4 agonist and (b) cyclic stretching. (3) Determine the
importance of TRPV4 activation in AF cells in regulating ECM synthesis and remodeling
The proposed project will use an innovative design of stretching chambers that allows investigating the
integrative role of substrate cues (stiffness, topography) and mechanical stimulation in modulating cell function
and fate. TRPV4 will be activated by specific agonists or stretching upon seeding in these chambers and cell
responses will be determined by qPCR, ELISA, and Western Blot for targets selected based on RNA-seq data.
Furthermore, ECM synthesis and remodeling following TRPV4 activation will be evaluated.
This will be the first study to investigate TRPV4 in the context of substrate stiffness and topography in AF cells.
As the developed tools will also apply to other research areas, I can help advance the fundamental understanding
of mechanotransduction processes in health and disease. The gained knowledge will be applicable in tissue
engineering and support the identification of new drug targets related to dysregulated mechanotransduction."
11034650,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Innate immunity is critical for human health, allowing cells to detect and combat invasion by pathogens.
Mitochondria are essential organelles that play important roles within the regulation of innate immune
pathways. Contact sites between mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (mitochondria/ER contacts, or
MERCs) are important for mitochondrial homeostasis (such as replication of mitochondrial DNA, or mtDNA),
but also act as signaling platforms for antiviral responses to viral dsRNA. However, the role of MERCs in the
regulation of innate immune responses to cytoplasmic DNA is not well understood. In addition, mtDNA
activates innate immune pathways when released from mitochondria into the cytoplasm. Dr. Laura Newman
has found that MERCs stimulate the release of mtDNA in response to stalled mtDNA replication caused by
mtDNA damage. Though it is well-established that cytoplasmic mtDNA enhances antiviral defenses, whether
MERCs regulate mtDNA release during viral infection is unknown. Certain DNA viruses (HSV-1 and EBV)
damage mtDNA directly or inhibit its replication, suggesting that removal of mtDNA (and its antiviral properties)
may aid viral replication. This provides an ideal model system to test whether MERCs mediate release of
damaged mtDNA during infection. In addition, RNA viruses disrupt the ER and MERCs to replicate. Release of
mtDNA from mitochondria occurs during infection by several RNA viruses (such as influenza); therefore,
MERCs may also mediate mtDNA release in response to RNA viral infection. The central hypothesis is that
MERCs regulate mtDNA release and coordinate dsRNA and DNA innate immune responses to amplify cellular
antiviral defenses. Aim #1 examines whether MERCs stimulate mtDNA release during HSV-1 or EBV infection,
and whether mtDNA release into the cytosol benefits the host cell or virus. Aim #2 builds upon Dr. Newman’s
preliminary data that the mitochondrial protein MFN1 enhances innate immune responses to cytoplasmic DNA,
and tests whether MFN1 complexes with two innate immune adaptors that sense DNA (STING) and dsRNA
(MAVS) at MERCs to regulate antiviral defenses. Lastly, Aim #3 examines whether RNA viruses (Influenza A
and SARS-CoV-2) disrupt MERCs, causing stalled mtDNA replication and release, and whether this enhances
antiviral defenses. Successful completion of any aim will provide important insights into the regulation of
antiviral defenses, possibly informing new therapeutic targets to limit viral infection. This research will also
provide virology training to the candidate, and research on viral-mitochondrial interactions will be carried over
to her own lab. This award will enable Dr. Newman to take advantage of virology and immunology expertise via
her advisory committee (Drs. O’Shea and Kaech), as well as additional career development opportunities at
the Salk Institute. This will aid her transition to an independent scientist specializing in the role of mitochondria
within innate immune pathways, which is a rapidly expanding and important area of scientific research."

 Circadian clocks are a defining feature of living organisms. Rhythms originate from the molecular clocks
of cells and propagate anatomically across the brain and body. A molecular understanding of the cooperation
among 30 trillion individual clocks in the human body is a daunting yet important scientific challenge. Currently,
much less is known of non-brain cell clocks, termed ‘peripheral clocks’ or ‘peripheral oscillators’. My research
program aims to identify coordination mechanisms that enable higher-order (e.g., from cells to tissue) circadian
rhythms and their physiological implications. To study clock function at the multi-oscillator level, we use molecular
approaches and genetically defined cell and mouse models. We aim to achieve two goals specifically for this
ESI MIRA R35 proposal. First, we will investigate how noisy, damped, and incomplete clock mechanisms within
single cells combine to produce unified, precise, and robust rhythms at the organ-level. We will tease apart this
coordination mechanism by applying single-cell methodologies and bioinformatic tools to quantify the behavior
of individual hepatocyte oscillators under different liver rhythmicity states in vivo. Second, we will interrogate how
rhythms are coupled across two peripheral organs. It is unclear how multiple tissue clocks synergize towards
systemic-level control of daily homeostatic functions. Using a novel genetic mouse model that I have already
constructed and validated, we will test the reciprocal influence between liver and skeletal muscle clocks and
delineate the contribution of this axis to the biochemical makeup of the systemic circulation over circadian time.
We will also determine how this axis is augmented by feeding-fasting behavior, a major brain-driven circadian
cue. For both goals, we will focus on the identification of key molecular mediators and downstream homeostatic
functions. The MIRA will afford us the ability to chase down the most impactful leads from these two areas and
will allow me to dedicate more time to mentoring activities, an aspect of academic life that I am passionate about.
My research program, based in circadian biology, provides a technically and conceptually rich training
environment for graduate students and postdoctoral associates. As a whole, the proposed work will generate
foundational knowledge of the complex inter-cellular interactions that generate rhythms. This knowledge is
crucial for elucidating the molecular basis of rhythm disruption, an ever-growing occurrence in modern society.
Circadian disruption is broadly linked with disease and thus understanding fundamental clock mechanisms offers
insight into root causes of many human ailments. Likewise, the proposed studies will yield novel molecular
targets aimed at counteracting rhythm disruption."

11012003,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Stimuli (cues) in the environment associated with reward can motivate normal behavior, bringing one in close
proximity to valuable resources (e.g. food); but they can also gain inordinate control over behavior, as is the
case with addiction. The ability of reward cues to motivate behavior occurs through Pavlovian learning
processes. When a discrete cue is repeatedly paired with presentation of a reward, it can acquire the ability to
act as a predictor, but can also acquire incentive motivational properties. In individuals with addiction, cues that
have been previously associated with the drug-taking experience acquire the ability to maintain drug-seeking
behavior and instigate relapse, even when there is a strong desire to stop use. The neurobiological processes
by which reward cues gain inordinate control over behavior have proven difficult to discern because cues can
simultaneously acquire “predictive” and “incentive” properties, and in most studies these two psychological
processes are confounded. In the proposed studies we will exploit natural variation in cue-reward learning to
identify the neural circuitry specifically responsible for the attribution of incentive motivational value (incentive
salience) to reward cues. When rats are exposed to a Pavlovian conditioned approach paradigm, some,
termed “goal-trackers”, attribute predictive value to a discrete food-associated cue; whereas others, termed
“sign-trackers” attribute incentive salience to the cue. Relative to goal-trackers, sign-trackers are more
susceptible to behavioral control by discrete food- and drug-paired cues and have a greater propensity for cue-
induced reinstatement or relapse. Using this animal model, we have found that the paraventricular nucleus of
the thalamus (PVT) plays a critical role in incentive learning processes and in regulating individual differences
in relapse propensity. The PVT appears to act as a node that integrates “top-down” and “bottom-up” input to
regulate cue-driven behaviors, but the subcortical circuitry subserving incentive salience attribution remains to
be determined. The research goal of this administrative supplement is to identify the neurochemical signature
of the PVT under baseline conditions and that which emerges as a consequence of cue-reward learning. In
addition, we will determine whether manipulations of a subcortical pathway, that from the lateral hypothalamus
(LH) to the PVT, alter the neurochemical profile of the PVT in conjunction with changes in behavior. This work
is a natural extension of that proposed in the parent award and in line with the overarching goal: to identify
critical components of the neural circuitry that contribute to addiction liability."

There is a major gap in our understanding of how paternal experiences leads to the increased risk of metabolic
disease in offspring. Here we focus on the heritable metabolic effects of benzene. Using a novel mouse model
for paternal benzene exposure, we provide convincing evidence for a causal relationship between paternal
benzene exposure and a sex specific offspring phenotype of impaired glycemic control when under metabolic
stress. We provide evidence for clear transcriptional signatures of metabolic disease, specifically in male
offspring. Based on these data we hypothesize that paternal benzene exposure triggers a specific signal in
sperm, which when transferred leads to predisposition to metabolic disease. To test the hypothesis, we will
utilize state of the art exposure system, a novel mouse model of intergenerational benzene exposure, and
pharmacological intervention to critically address the mechanism and pathophysiological significance
underlying metabolic programming triggered by benzene exposure. First we will perform in depth metabolic
and energy homeostasis phenotyping to identify the physiological consequences of paternal benzene exposure
in unexposed offspring. Second, we will identify the transcriptional signatures of intergenerational benzene
exposure in insulin sensitive tissues from offspring. Finally we will test if treatment of paternal metabolic
disease with a well characterized diabetes drug prevents the offspring phenotype; To define the mechanistic
basis for benzene-induced intergenerational reprograming, we will identify germline and epigenetic signatures
of benzene exposure, and mechanistically connect the epigenetic changes in the germline to offspring
transcriptional rewiring. The proposed research will, for the first time, define the causal relationship between
paternal exposure to benzene, and offspring metabolic disease susceptibility. Such a study will be of
importance to understand how paternal exposure drives non-genetic, metabolic reprogramming across
generations."

Numerous studies show that mental health conditions are linked to abnormal activity in specific brain networks.
In major depressive disorder (MDD) the frontoparietal network (FPN) experiences reduced activity and disrupted
connectivity, closely tied to clinical symptoms. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has gained FDA
approval as a non-invasive, effective alternative for drug resistant MDD patients. While repetitive TMS (rTMS)
administered to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DFPLC) using a single coil alleviates depressive symptoms, it fails
to restore the global connectivity of the FPN. Therefore, this proposal leverages the use of our recently developed
multichannel TMS (mTMS) array system combined with electroencephalography (EEG) to simultaneously
modulate and record activity across multiple nodes of a cortical network. To implement network-specific multifocal
TMS for neuropsychiatric disorders, several technical aspects need to be further developed. The network
subregion targets need to be identified for each individual and here we propose to use combined functional and
structural connectivity measures obtained from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data for maximal spatial
specificity. We use computational methods to determine the best possible combination of all coil elements in the
array to stimulate the network nodes, while minimizing the effects elsewhere. We will utilize a whole-head TMS
compatible EEG system to quantify the changes in functional connectivity concurrently with the multifocal
stimulation of different network subregions. The goals of this project include optimizing the targeting of brain
subregions within the Frontoparietal Network (FPN) and Sensorimotor Network (SMN), validated through
structural and functional imaging techniques. By investigating the effects of bifocal stimulation on network
connectivity, particularly focusing on the connectivity changes in alpha/theta synchronization between the
DLPFC and Posterior Parietal Cortex (PPC), the project aims to advance our understanding of network-level
brain connectivity. The anticipated impact is to improve our understanding of network-level brain dysfunctions
and to potentially develop more effective TMS therapies for neuropsychiatric disorders."

Viruses are a major threat to human health. Our laboratory uses various structural biology techniques to
dissect molecular mechanisms of how viruses replicate and invade the host cell or its genome. One area of our
major interest is retroviral integration, a critical step in the lifecycle of retroviruses that achieves permanent
insertion of the reverse-transcribed viral genome into a host chromosome. We will build on our recent structural
studies of the Human T-cell Leukemia virus and Rous sarcoma virus intasomes and further investigate the
roles of host factors during the integration of these retroviruses. Another area that we are pursuing is the
replication of coronavirus RNA genomes and host cell invasion. In particular, we are interested in how a virally
encoded exoribonuclease complex facilitates faithful replication of the large RNA genomes of coronaviruses,
and how this unique proofreading activity could be modulated by small molecules. We are also investigating
the inhibition of the receptor binding of the coronavirus spike protein by novel antibodies and antibody mimics.
Overall, the studies proposed in this application will help better understand important RNA-based human
pathogens and could aid in the development of antiviral strategies, or alternatively, gene delivery tools useful in
research or gene therapy applications.
 Throughout our research program, accurately characterizing the thermodynamics (i.e., determining the

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Adaptive evolution is a fundamental process in biology. At its simplest random mutation produces
phenotypic variation on which selection acts, enriching for favorable phenotypes and purging the less-
favorable ones. This process has produced the diversity of life on Earth. Yet at the same time, adaptive
evolution is responsible for some of the most vexing problems in human health, from the growing problem
of antibiotic resistance to real-time evolution of viral pathogens to cancers that resist drug treatments and
evade the immune system. Despite this, we lack a basic mechanistic understanding of how genomes
respond to selection. One major unknown is how adaptive evolution “chooses” one particular path from
among a vast number of possible ones. Another major unknown is how genetic variation produces new
phenotypes on which selection acts. Experimental Evolution provides a way forward to address both of
these significant gaps in our knowledge. With advances in high-throughput biology we can evolve hundreds
of initially identical populations in parallel for thousands of generations, with exquisite control over
experimental parameters. This versatile technique makes it possible to test evolutionary theory through
experiments that are impossible to perform in natural populations. At the same time, experimental evolution
is powerful tool for functional genomics. By identifying the genes and pathways that respond to selective
pressures, and how these mutations interact to alter phenotype, laboratory evolution experiments identify
previously unknown cellular connections. In the past five years my laboratory has advanced a mechanistic
understanding of adaptive evolution. Future work will determine how genetic changes give rise to complex
phenotypes. We will perform evolution experiments following perturbation of the genetic background and
in shifting environments. In addition to advancing our understanding of adaptive evolution, we expect,
based on our prior work, to identify previously unknown nuclear-nuclear, nuclear-cytoplasmic, and gene-
environment interactions. Finally, we will develop a fast and reliable method for performing multiple rounds
of pooled gene editing in yeast, and we will use this method to systematically assay genetic interactions
that have been missed by other methods. By connecting genotype to phenotype in an evolutionary context,
our work will provide a mechanistic understanding of how complex traits evolve. This work will advance
our understanding of adaptive evolution and the genetic basis of complex traits in less tractable systems,
including humans and human pathogens."

The goal of this research program is to advance oral health equity through strengthening the scientific basis for
innovations in population approaches to improving dental care access, utilization, and quality for all. Mounting
evidence suggests that oral health disparities and inequities in the US are largely attributed to population-specific
differences in access to, utilization of, and the quality of oral health care services. These differences arise from
system-wide interactions between biological, psychological, social, environmental, economic, policy, and other
factors. While there is increasing awareness of these complexities, meaningful scientific progress and translation
is stymied by the preponderance of investigations that maintain a focus on individual, single-level factors in
isolation. The proposed research program will incorporate a framework that integrates multi-level perspectives
and approaches (e.g., patient, provider, and population) to advance oral health equity, facilitated by the PI’s
expertise as a social epidemiologist and complex systems scientist. Specifically, the proposed research will
generate novel data on historically underrepresented populations and employ methodologies to conduct
innovative investigations that lie at the intersections of dental care access, utilization, and quality. Findings will
serve to advance the understanding of how and why population oral health disparities and inequities emerge
and facilitate more comprehensive and actionable insights."

The health and well-being of older sexual and gender minorities (SGM) have been greatly shaped by structural
forces, namely discrimination and, for older SGM of color, racism. Their contemporary history and life course
have been defined by exodus from hostile environments and the formation of supportive communities. The
overall goal of this research is to shed light on the extent and the manner in which structural racism and
discrimination shapes older SGM’s health. This study will assess the relationships among health, stigma,
structural racism and discrimination, resources, and biomarkers of health and aging in older SGM of four
racial/ethnic groups— African American, Latinx, Asian American, and White— and across HIV status. This
research is needed because older SGM’s health fares worse than that of their heterosexual counterparts, their
exposure to structural discrimination is higher, and they have less access to supportive resources than older
heterosexual men. Notably, 40 years after we first faced HIV, we continue to learn about the consequences of
HIV, including aging with HIV. Gay men comprise the majority of older people living with HIV. Older SGM face
unique health risks and protective factors, yet they constitute a very diverse and complex population. What we
know about their health comes from mostly white, well-educated, and convenient samples. Hence, the need to
collect data from diverse and valid samples. This is a cross sectional study based on San Francisco Bay Area.
Quantitative and Qualitative data will be collected from a sample of 600 older gay men and 150 transgender
women. We will collect structural, individual, and biological data to test hypotheses regarding the associations
among structural racism and discrimination, resources, and health (e.g., mental health, HIV risk, cognitive
function). Our team is multidisciplinary and includes our community partner, The Elizabeth Taylor 50-Plus
Network (of the San Francisco AIDS Foundation). This proposal is in response to NIH’s RFA Understanding
and Addressing the Impact of Structural Racism and Discrimination on Minority Health and Health Disparities.
It addresses the Office of AIDS Research Strategic Plan of tackling HIV comorbidities and health disparities.
The data and findings from this study are intended to constitute the baseline for a longitudinal study."

 Age-related hearing loss is exceedingly common, with an estimated 60% of individuals over 70 years of
age having hearing loss significant enough to interfere with communication and affect quality of life. However,
increasing evidence suggests that the overt loss of hearing thresholds alone fails to capture real-world hearing
difficulties experienced by older adults. One hitherto undiagnosed cause of hearing deficits could be the
progressive loss of synapses between the inner hair cell and the auditory nerve with age, termed cochlear
synaptopathy. Cochlear synaptopathy is thought to affect speech intelligibility under complex listening conditions,
yet it goes undetected by the threshold audiogram, remaining ‘hidden’. While the functional consequences of
cochlear synaptopathy are still unclear, emerging evidence suggests that it is associated with deficits in
representation of timing cues in the auditory periphery. This may differentially affect the encoding of rapid
stimulus temporal fine structure (sTFS) cues in speech, which are critical for listening in noisy conditions.
 Establishing the effects of cochlear synaptopathy on decreased speech-in-noise intelligibility cannot be
accomplished in a single species. Perceptual deficits observed in humans cannot be attributed directly to
cochlear synaptopathy, because anatomical synaptopathy is only verifiable in post-mortem specimens. Rodent
models offer the means to directly measure cochlear synaptic integrity but are limited in their potential to serve
as models of human speech perception under real-world settings. This proposal addresses these translational
challenges by integrating research in humans and animal models, with non-invasive electrophysiological
responses measured under near identical conditions in both humans and animal models acting as the
translational bridge. Experiments in Aim 1 will use a battery of behavioral and electrophysiological methods in
humans to test the hypothesis that degradations in speech-in-noise intelligibility with age are accompanied by
altered neural coding of sTFS cues. In Aim 2, the role of age-related cochlear synaptopathy in degraded sTFS
processing will be studied in an animal model whose hearing range is sensitive to human speech frequencies,
using the electrophysiological biomarkers of sTFS processing validated in humans. Aim 3 will isolate
contributions of cochlear synaptopathy to the neural coding of sTFS cues from possible confounding age-related
effects by inducing graded synaptopathy in young animals and evaluating the same electrophysiological and
immunohistological markers used in Aim 2. The completion of this project has the potential to result in a single
biomarker that links cochlear synaptopathy to deficits in speech-in-noise intelligibility. The project will further
establish an integrated research pipeline that can accelerate the translation of pre-clinical studies to early human
trials for future biomarkers or interventional therapies. Finally, the data obtained here will form the basis for future
studies that will follow this translational approach to explore the interactions between age-related cochlear
synaptopathy, peripheral threshold sensitivity, and compensatory plasticity in the central auditory pathway."

 The overarching goal of my research program is to elucidate the roles of dynamic DNA-histone
interactions in the nucleosome in regulating gene accessibility from single-molecule approaches. The
nucleosome is the fundamental packing unit of genes in eukaryotes and plays important roles in gene
regulation. Errors in gene regulation often lead to developmental failure and lethal diseases such as various
types of cancer. The nucleosome is made of ~147 bp ds-DNA with an octameric histone protein core. DNA and
histones are targets for various chromatin modifications that are often critically implicated in gene regulation
mechanisms. We reported several important changes in the structure and structural dynamics of the
nucleosome induced by various chromatin modifications and histone variants such as DNA methylation,
histone acetylations, SUMOylation, CENP-A, and H2A.Z in the context of their roles in gene regulation. As
these changes are heterogeneous, unsynchronized, and/or complex, they are often impossible to resolve with
ensemble-averaging biochemical, genetic, and static structural biology tools. We develop and improve single-
molecule fluorescence methods and systems, mainly based on FRET, FCS, and colocalization at an optical
super-resolution to address these problems. We will continue pushing the boundaries of these experimental
systems and methods to support our future research that will center around three synergistic themes: how (1)
chromatin modifications and histone variants, (2) spontaneous molecular motions and interactions, and (3)
active and passive molecular machines and enzymes affect DNA-histone dynamics in nucleosomes and
nucleosome arrays and how the effects are implicated in gene regulation mechanisms.
 We recently started evolving our mostly nucleosome-focused experimental systems by combining
various enzymes that act on the nucleosome and expanding them to include nucleosome arrays. Based on
these systems, our research will continue largely in three topical areas in the next five years: (1) nucleosome
dynamics during its interaction with complex enzymes such as RNA polymerase II and Dot1L, a key player in
H3K79 methylation-dependent leukemia pathogenesis, (2) the effects of chromatin modifications on the
structure and dynamics of the nucleosome and their implications in nucleosome-enzyme interactions, (3)
conformations and dynamics of nucleosome arrays and the effects of chromatin modifications on nucleosome
dynamics in nucleosome arrays. Investigations in these areas will help understand the fundamental molecular
processes that regulate nucleosome dynamics and gene accessibility during nucleosome-enzyme interactions
in a nucleosome and a nucleosome-array context and at depth and clarity afforded by our highly-refined
tractable single-molecule systems."

Latinx individuals are 1.5 times more likely to develop Alzheimer's disease and related dementia
(ADRD) than non-Latinx White adults. However, compared with non-Latinx Whites, they are less
likely to receive a diagnosis, and when they do, they are more likely to be at late stages in the
disease process. This is a result of individual and contextual factors that limit access to health
care services in older Latinx adults, resulting in worse health outcomes for patients and caregiv-
ers. To improve access to care for Latinx individuals, it is necessary to account for Latinx individ-
uals' diverse backgrounds and socioeconomic characteristics, and develop innovative interven-
tions that are feasible to implement in underserved areas. The proposed K99 phase includes
training to fill my gaps in knowledge—the organizational factors affecting access to ADRD
healthcare services, the use of behavior change theories and design thinking in health interven-
tions, and the conduct of pragmatic trials in ADRD research. The overarching objective of this
proposal is to increase access to culturally appropriate ADRD services by performing a compre-
hensive assessment of the barriers existing at five locations in the US and engaging a team of
stakeholders in a human-centered process to develop a systems-level intervention for increasing
access to ADRD services. To achieve these goals, we propose a multiphase mixed methods
research process. Aim 1 (K99 Phase) includes the validation of a survey instrument that measures
beliefs that affect intentions to seek care for cognitive symptoms. This instrument will be an im-
portant tool to describe the individual beliefs that sustain health disparities in subsequent stages.
Aim 2 (K99-R00 phase) includes partnering with five (5) community health clinics in different cities
around the US to characterize the individual and contextual factors that affect Latinx access to
ADRD healthcare services. For this, we will use the BESIC instrument to describe beliefs among
Latinx patients, hold five focus groups with Latinx patients with ADRD and their caregivers, and
conduct up to 50 interviews with key informant stakeholders. Aim 3 (R00 Phase) will involve part-
nering with one community health clinic to co-design a human-centered intervention for promoting
Latinx access to healthcare services for ADRD. At the conclusion of this project, we will have a
validated survey instrument to assess ADRD beliefs linked to health care seeking behaviors in
heterogeneous Latinx populations and a prototype of an intervention to increase access to ADRD
services. Future studies will pilot the intervention and subsequently evaluate its effectiveness us-
ing an embedded pragmatic trial."

Center of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) application 5P20GM139762 established the Translational
Hearing Center (THC) at Creighton University with Boys Town National Research Hospital and the University
of Nebraska Medical Center, as institutional partners The goal of the COBRE has been “to build a critical
mass of academic translational researchers developing therapeutic interventions to preserve or restore hearing
and vestibular function from a wide range of etiologies that cause hearing loss and vestibular deficits”. A key
aim of the COBRE is to develop infrastructure to support innovative research by THC investigators. Toward
that goal, this equipment supplement requests funds to replace and upgrade an obsolete FACSAria II cell
sorter with a state-of-the-art Bigfoot five-laser 53 parameter cell sorter from Life Technologies Corporation
(hereafter termed “Bigfoot”). The Bigfoot’s gentle, but rapid, sorting and spectral analysis capabilities will
enable THC researchers to more readily identify and characterize cells involved in the etiology and progression
of disorders leading to hearing loss, and open new avenues for high-throughput screening within the COBRE’s
Drug Discovery and Delivery Core Facility. The integration of the Bigfoot within an intentionally designed
biosafety cabinet will vastly improve personnel safety and diminish potential sample contamination compared
to the existing FACSAria II cell sorter. By placing the Bigfoot within an established multi-user Flow Cytometry
Core Facility, we will ensure proper instrument oversight, management, use, and training, which will facilitate
investigator access, reliability, and student learning. The Bigfoot’s greater complementarity with an existing
BioRAD ZE5 flow cytometer (analysis only; no sorting capability) will reduce the need to alter antibody panels
used for multi-color analysis and sorting, offer new opportunities for high-dimensional analysis, and provide a
backup for unexpected repairs of the BioRAD ZE5. Institutional support for the acquisition of the Bigfoot is
demonstrated through a 1:1 match to funds that would be awarded for this supplement. Overall, the Bigfoot is
expected to enhance not only the research infrastructure available for THC investigators, but have broad
positive impact on the Creighton research community as a whole."
11034042,"Patients with critical surgical disorders such as trauma, thermal injury, shock, sepsis, and
massive surgical operations are commonly complicated with acute gut mucosal injury and
bleeding. Disruption of the gut epithelial integrity causes sepsis and in some instances acts as
the trigger that drives multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), a leading cause of death in
critically ill patients. Effective therapies to enhance mucosal defense and promote epithelial
repair after acute injury in patients with critical surgical illnesses are limited, contributing to
massive mucosal hemorrhage, impaired repair, and gut barrier dysfunction. During the previous
funding periods, we have demonstrated that protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)-associated protein
α4 plays an important role in intestinal mucosal regeneration and defense, but its exact
mechanism underlying α4-regulated intestinal homeostasis remains largely unknown.
Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), including microRNAs (miRNAs) and long ncRNAs (lncRNAs), have
recently emerged as a novel class of master regulators of the intestinal epithelium homeostasis
and are also implicated in different human diseases. miRNAs and lncRNAs modulate
expression of target genes and thus regulate a variety of cellular processes.
Our preliminary results indicate that a) targeted deletion of α4 in mice decreased the levels of
mucosal miR-503 and lncRNA uc.230 in the intestine; b) specific inhibition of miR-503 and
uc.230 by transfection with their antagonisms repressed intestinal epithelial repair after
wounding and also enhanced epithelial cell apoptosis; and c) miR-503 inhibited expression of
antizyme (AZ; a negative regulator of polyamine biosynthesis), whereas uc.230 up-regulated
Rac1 and inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 (IAP1). Based on these exciting observations, we
HYPOTHESIZE that α4 promotes intestinal epithelial homeostasis by modulating miRNA miR-
503 and lncRNA uc.230 in critical surgical conditions.
Three specific aims are proposed to test the hypothesis: 1) to examine the expression profiles of
miRNAs and lncRNAs in the α4-deficient intestinal epithelium in response to surgical stress; 2)
to determine the exact roles of miR-503 and uc.230 in α4-regulated mucosal repair and
apoptosis; and 3) to define the mechanisms by which miR-503 and uc.230 regulate expression
of AZ, Rac1, and IAP1. Completion of these specific aims will make a conceptual advance by
linking α4/ncRNA pathway with gut epithelium homeostasis under critical surgical conditions.
These studies will also create a fundamental basis for development of novel therapies to
preserve epithelial integrity in our VA patients, thus decreasing morbidity and mortality of
massive mucosal injury and inflammation, delayed repair, sepsis, and MODS by targeting α4
and its regulatory ncRNAs."

independent extramural funding; Aim 2, Promote the fundamental understanding of the visual system through
optimizing relevant technical infrastructure; Aim 3, Promote a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to
impactful visual sciences research; and Aim 4: Implement a rigorous strategy to evaluate the effectiveness of
the VS-CoBRE towards promoting a robust center of excellence in visual sciences. With our existing strengths
and research infrastructure network, coupled with the initiatives proposed in this VS-CoBRE, including mentoring
of our four-promising junior PLs, we are well-positioned to achieve our goal. The creation of a center of
excellence provides a venue for integrating efforts across the campus, including activities supported by NIGMS
including the WV CTSI and other CoBREs, the clinical enterprise in the Department of Ophthalmology and Visual
Sciences, and investigations led by basic biologists in the Departments of Biochemistry, Neuroscience, Biology,
and the program in Biomedical Engineering. The VS-CoBRE will coalesce vision scientists around a common
theme, enhance the intellectual environment, and cultivate cross collaborations. When the investigators
proposed for support by this grant achieve independence by obtaining an R01-equivalent award, we will leverage
the VS-CoBRE to recruit additional junior scientists whose work pertains to visual sciences. The core facilities
and research infrastructure supported by the CoBRE will also allow our investigators to produce research results
that will translate to patients, moving us toward our ultimate goal of reducing the burden of visual impairment
and its comorbidities in the Appalachian region, throughout the nation, and worldwide."
11035975,"SUMMARY: Circadian rhythm is important for human physiology and health. Human body temperature
increases during wakefulness and decreases during sleep. This body temperature rhythm (BTR) is a robust
output of the circadian clock and is fundamental for maintaining homeostasis and its related processes, such
as sleep and metabolism. The long-term goal of our research is to understand the molecular and neural
mechanisms by which BTR is regulated and how BTR is related to sleep regulation.
 To understand the mechanisms of BTR, we use Drosophila. This model has provided many strong
contributions to studying the circadian clock, including the discovery of conserved mammalian circadian clock
genes and mechanisms. We demonstrated that Drosophila exhibits a circadian rhythm of temperature
preference, referred to as temperature preference rhythms (TPR). While mammals regulate BTR by generating
or losing internal heat, small ectotherms, including Drosophila, regulate BTR via selecting an environmental
temperature. As flies are small ectotherms, their body temperature is close to that of the surrounding
environment. Thus, Drosophila TPR produces BTR in a similar pattern as mammals. Furthermore, our study
provides the first evidence that fly DH31R and its mammalian homolog, Calcitonin receptor, CALCR, regulate
BTR. Thus, understanding fly TPR will provide fundamental insights into the molecular and neural mechanisms
that control BTR in mammals.
 Using fly TPR, in this study, we will address an outstanding knowledge gap regarding how
temperature fluctuations are determined and how the preferred temperature is set at a specific time of day. We
will elucidate the molecular and neural mechanisms underlying TPR. We will examine the distinct functions of
each pacemaker by manipulating their activities and neuropeptide-receptor signals which could control
temperature fluctuation or temperature setpoint. We will clarify the mechanistic difference between TPR and
locomotor activity, focusing on a noncanonical pathway that we anticipate to be a specific regulator of TPR.
This study will unveil the unique neural circuits controlling fly TPR. Further, we will take advantage of fly TPR
and determine the mechanistic link between temperature change and sleep; their relationship has been well
known, but the underpinning molecular mechanism has been a big mystery. This study will facilitate an
understanding the regulatory mechanisms underlying BTR and its relationship to sleep.
 We have shown that parallel mechanistic functions between mammalian BTR and fly TPR; thus, the
basic foundation of BTR is aligned with fly TPR. The outcome of this R35 proposal will facilitate to reveal BTR
mechanisms in mammals and lend actionable insights into the treatment of circadian clock diseases, sleep
problems, and the health of night-shift workers."

investigators in NACP. The overall goal is to equip ESI/JIs for submission of successful R01 level cancer-
related research grants and achieve rewarding academic careers. GUIDeS is focused on promoting Native
American and underrepresented ESI/JIs and postdoctoral scholars to increase representation in cancer health
disparity research. GUIDeS has embraced the two-eyed seeing paradigm, which seeks to “see from one eye
with the strengths of Indigenous knowledges and ways of knowing, and from the other eye with the strengths of
Western knowledges and ways of knowing, and to use both of these eyes together for the benefit of all.” 1
GUIDeS adapts this approach to allow the two perspectives of the GPs and GUIDeS Co-Leaders to meld these
perspectives to promote positive career trajectories. GUIDeS interacts with the other NACP Cores and
research projects to ensure services and expertise across NACP are available to early researchers.
 Since its beginning in 2019, GUIDeS supported 29 GPs cancer or health disparity grant proposals and
seven American Indian Alaska Native (AIAN) CURE pipeline submissions, exceeding the NACP 5-year goal to
submit six applications to the CURE pipeline. Since GUIDeS is in its early stages, the adaption of the two-
eyed seeing approach was used to improve the Shared Resource for the next grant cycle.
Aim 1. Increase the development and submission of cancer research grants and manuscripts by
identifying mentors to support GPs in developing a path to successful academic research addressing cancer
disparities among Native Americans.
Aim 2. Provide enhanced analytical support for cancer research by providing GPs with workshops, and
analytical infrastructure to enhance contributions to cancer health disparities research.
Aim 3. Support extended opportunities for professional and career development by providing academic
career planning opportunities for early-stage faculty using a “mapping strategy” to set aside blocks of time for
teaching, writing of grants and publications. GUIDeS will assist in navigating the university promotion and
tenure process, development of R01-level research, and promoting work-life balance."

The complexity of the HIV-1 transcriptome has been progressively revealed throughout recent
decades using increasingly advanced RNA sequencing technologies. However, knowledge of the
RNA primary sequence alone has not been sufficient to determine the importance or function of
each of the over 40 highly conserved HIV-1 splice variants, which code for nine known proteins and
polyproteins. RNA-protein interactions are fundamental to RNA fate and function. From
transcription to cellular localization to translation of the gene product, and many steps in between,
proteins interact with RNA to regulate gene expression and, in the case of HIV-1, viral replication.
Notwithstanding the high significance of these splice variants in the HIV-1 life cycle, technologies
for interrogating the functions, interactions, and cellular localizations of individual splice variants
are woefully lacking.
We propose to develop and validate a suite of powerful new tools to interrogate the functions,
interactions, and cellular localizations of individual splice variants of HIV-1. We will develop sensitive
and multiplexed assays (HyPR-MS) to elucidate the protein interactomes of up to 20 conserved HIV-
1 mRNA splice variants. We will develop a branched DNA fluorescence in situ hybridization
technique (SV-FISH) to examine how changes in the expression levels of individual splice variant
protein interactors alter their localization. Finally, we will determine which of the splice variants and
protein interactors are critical to HIV replication and infectivity using siRNA and protein knock-down
and overexpression studies.
These powerful new tools will be used here to elucidate previously unobtainable information about
HIV-1 replication. Once developed, these same novel technologies will comprise a powerful new
toolset that can be applied to splice variant investigations in other viral and cellular systems."

 Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are a group of inherited diseases characterized by dysfunctions in
lysosomes, with cumulative frequency of 1 in 7000 live births. Over 2/3 of LSD patients present an involvement
of the central nerve system (CNS) with a broad spectrum of severity (nLSD), which makes LSDs the most
common cause of pediatric neuronopathic diseases. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)
or enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) are main treatment options for LSDs. However, they are largely
unsuccessful in reversing neurological complications due to the poor penetration of the enzymes into the CNS,
a major obstacle in treating nLSD. The impact of the proposed study is driven by the unmet medical need for
efficient treatment of inherited nLSDs AND the major limitation of enzyme-delivery into the CNS.
 The cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (M6PR) plays a critical role in lysosomal enzyme
trafficking and intercellular transfer for the majority of lysosomal enzymes, which is essential for metabolic cross-
correction in treating LSDs. Developmental decline of M6PR on blood-brain-barrier (BBB) during early postnatal
period in mouse and human is attributable to the lack of CNS enzyme delivery into adult brain. Using a dual
luciferase reporter system with site-mutagenesis, we have recently identified microRNA-143 (miR143) as an
epigenetic modulator to reduce M6PR protein levels on brain microvessels (BrMV). Using a mouse model of
Hurler syndrome (severe mucopolysaccharidosis type I, MPS I), which is caused by the deficiency of α-L-
iduronidase (IDUA), we demonstrated functional rescue of M6PR-mediated IDUA transfer in the brain of double-
knockout (MPS/miR-143KO) mice with long-term CNS therapeutic benefits, as well as in human vascular
endothelial cells by sequestration of miR-143 with miR-143-sponge sequences. The data provide strong
scientific premise for the development of a novel approach that would selectively “open” BBB to systemic
enzymes provided by any current treatment options or future enzyme/gene/cell therapies for synergistic CNS
benefits in many nLSDs. In this proposal, we aim to develop an adeno-associated viral vector (AAV)-based
translatable platform to “restore” M6PR pathway on mature BBB for advanced delivery of therapeutic enzymes
into the CNS with 3 aims, including developing optimal artificial miR143 inhibitor (143in) and expression
cassette(s) for robust and targeted reduction of miR143 on brain endothelia cells (Aim 1), in vivo examination of
“on-target” and “off-target” expression and effects in mice with AAV/143in delivery (Aim 2), as well as preclinical
evaluation of BrMV-targeted AAV/143in in correcting CNS abnormalities in MPS I mice by enzyme therapy
derived from genetically modified erythroid/megakaryocytic lineages (Aim 3). The studies will provide a proof-
of concept for a new in vivo miRNA-inhibitor mediated, brain-targeted approach that could be applicable for
many other nLSDs involving M6PR pathway AND neurological diseases benefiting from advanced CNS delivery
of therapeutics via adapting M6PR-mediated transport pathway by modification with M6P residues or IGF2-tag."
11019567,"In this Administrative Supplements for Research on Sexual and Gender Minority Populations, our aim is to fill a
significant gap in Turner syndrome (TS) research by addressing how the missing sex chromosome impacts
liver health in this unique female population. Patients with TS frequently present with obesity and liver damage,
including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, the underlying mechanisms are unclear.
Leveraging our expertise in NAFLD study, this application focuses on investigating the role of an X-linked
gene, KDM6a/UTX, in TS-associated NAFLD. KDM6a/UTX, a gene that codes for H3K27 demethylases, is
downregulated in TS patients as well as in TS mouse livers. It plays a critical role in the histone demethylation
of genes crucial for heart development and is also associated with the development of hyperinsulinemia,
metabolic abnormalities, or acetaminophen overdose-induced hepatotoxicity. Based on these findings, we
hypothesize that KDM6a/UTX may play a role in the development of Turner syndrome-related NAFLD. This
hypothesis will be tested by both in vitro and in vivo studies, involving the utilization of primary mouse
hepatocytes and Turner syndrome mouse models. The successful completion of these studies will establish
whether KDM6a is a key player in regulating hepatocyte lipid metabolism and fatty liver disease in Turner

The health of animals often depends on their ability to form symbioses with bacteria that are acquired from
environmental reservoirs. Bacteria that express specific traits that increase host fitness, and in many cases,
hosts that lack these beneficial symbionts are at increased risk for developing disease. As part of our long-
term goal to understand how these symbioses are established and maintained, this proposal will investigate
several factors that impact the ability of the beneficial symbiont Vibrio fischeri to colonize and be maintained by
its natural host the Hawaiian bobtail squid Euprymna scolopes. The focus will be on three areas: 1)

and 3) evolution of signaling systems in bacterial symbionts. Progress in understanding these areas will
provide new insights into the mechanisms enabling bacterial symbionts to colonize and be maintained by their
hosts. The findings associated with this project may contribute to the strategies employed to improve host
health by manipulating beneficial symbionts."
11032352,"Insects have an innate immune system that protects against infections by pathogens and
parasites. The overall goal of this project is to investigate proteins in insect hemolymph plasma
that participate in different aspects of insect immunity. Previous work from this laboratory has
established the lepidopteran insect, Manduca sexta, as a model system well suited for
biochemical characterization of the complex functions of hemolymph proteins. In our work over
the next five years, we plan to investigate three aspects of immunity that are mediated by
plasma proteins. (1) We will characterize interactions of plasma proteins with peptidoglycan
from Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria that trigger activation of a serine protease,
thereby initiating protease cascades that result in activation of phenoloxidase and the Toll
pathway. (2) We will investigate how the redox environment of hemolymph is regulated during
an immune response and test a hypothesis that immune proteins may be regulated by thiol
modifications. (3) Mammals have well-characterized mechanisms for depriving invading
microorganisms of iron; however, immune-related iron-withholding in insects is still poorly
understood. We will use M. sexta as a model for discovering conserved iron-withholding
mechanisms in insects. The fundamental biochemical knowledge gained as a result of this
research is expected to stimulate better understanding of regulation of protease cascade
pathways and molecules in insect hemolymph that contribute to oxidative modulation during
immunity, and lead to understanding of how iron influences human disease transmission by
insect vectors."
11042274,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Pathological tau is present in a number of age-related diseases (tauopathies) including
Alzheimer's Disease (AD). With a rising aged population the prevalence of these diseases will
become an enormous healthcare, economic and social burden. To-date there are no clinically
proven disease altering treatments. Recently, we have discovered mutant tubulin modifies
tauopathy-like phenotypes in transgenic C. elegans models, reducing human tau-induced motility
deficits and neurodegeneration. We hypothesize that mutant tubulin ameliorates tau-induced
phenotypes in C. elegans by altering tau-microtubule interactions. To test our hypothesis we
propose to 1) use C. elegans to determine if the level of tubulin suppression is based in tubulin
expression level 2) use reconstituted in vitro systems to test whether tubulin mutations affect tau-
microtubule interactions and 3) use mammalian primary neurons to test whether mutant tubulin
impacts microtubule properties and function. The proposed projects will elucidate the
mechanisms of mutant tubulin suppression of tau induced-pathology and tau-microtubule
interactions. Additionally, this work will contribute greater understanding of the cytoskeleton in
neurodegenerative disease.
 My goal is to develop a career as a principal investigator devoted to the discovery of the
molecular mechanisms underpinning tauopathies and the roles the cytoskeletal network play in
neurodegeneration. To accomplish this, my training plan focuses on 1) expanding my technical
toolkit to incorporate biophysical approaches and live cell imaging 2) gaining greater knowledge
in the biology of aging 3) improving skills in laboratory leadership and expanding my professional
network.
 The University of Washington and the Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System
share an abundance of researchers interested in Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative
conditions. There are substantial intellectual resources such as seminars, journal clubs and
meetings that create numerous opportunities broaden my perspective through interactions with
the medical and scientific community in AD-related research."
11034979,"OVERALL PROJECT SUMMARY
The Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center (MCCCC) has engaged in intensive strategic planning and
evaluation efforts, formed a new External Scientific Advisory Committee, and completed a significant
transformation and reorganization with recruitment of new leaders and members to assure that prior concerns
raised in the 2018 NCI review of the MCCCC NCI P30 Cancer Center Support Grant (P30CA015083) were fully
addressed. With 3 highly integrated MCCCC sites serving distinct and diverse catchment areas (in Minnesota
and the Upper Midwest, Arizona, and Florida), it is our intent to continue to be recognized as one of the finest
NCI Designated Comprehensive Cancer Centers in the nation. In the last project period, MCCCC achieved its
highest levels of annual cancer-relevant funding ($68.7M total peer-reviewed ($43.5M from NCI); $66M industry
and non-peer reviewed; $23.4M state support) and accrual to cancer clinical trials (3,201 total interventional
accruals with 1,829 interventional treatment accruals; 38,304 interventional accruals to population science
studies; and 16,556 non-interventional accruals). Our Specific Aims are to:
1. Deeply engage the diverse patients and communities we serve at our three MCCCC sites and from across
 the nation and the globe, assuring that the research we conduct and the care we deliver meets patient and
 community priorities and needs and addresses the most important cancer challenges.
2. Conduct highly innovative, transformative, transdisciplinary research in our laboratory, clinical, and
 community settings and translate our discoveries to new means to prevent and treat cancer which yield new
 scientific paradigms, transform cancer practice, and impact cancer policy.
3. Test novel cancer diagnostic, prevention, detection, and therapeutic agents in clinical trials and interventions,
 engaging diverse patients and communities in our catchment areas and beyond.
4. Educate, train, and mentor a more diverse cancer workforce and leadership for the future, to meet the needs
 of those we serve, including the next generation of cancer investigators, physicians, scientists, and allied
 health personnel.
5. Overcome cancer health disparities, drive cancer health equity, and enhance inclusion and patient access
 through deep community engagement; the conduct of our research, training, and clinical care; development
 of innovative platforms and virtual and digital tools that transform cancer care delivery and decentralize
 cancer clinical trials and interventions to home and community settings; and sharing of our platforms, data,
 knowledge, and expertise.
Through these aims we seek to honor the primary value of Mayo Clinic - the needs of the patient come first - and
to ensure that we deliver the finest cancer care in the nation and the world derived from outstanding research,
compassion, and constant innovation, bringing hope and healing to all of those we serve."

to satisfy submission system requirements.
PROJECT SUMMARY (ABSTRACT)
The long-term goal of the proposed research is to elucidate the systems and circuits, within and across brain
regions, responsible for decision making. The objective of this proposal is to determine how a single target for
movement is selected among competing alternatives. An experimentally-tractable approach to achieving this
objective is to interrogate neural circuitry in behaving animals engaged in deciding where to move, a particularly
important form of decision making for survival that we refer to here as spatial choice. The midbrain superior
colliculus (SC) integrates input from several systems representing variables critical for goal-directed behavior,
topographically represents contralateral spatial targets for orienting movements, and is a critical node in the
network of brain regions responsible for spatial choice. However, the mechanisms underlying how spatial choices
are made is poorly understood.
 In a series of experiments in awake and behaving mice, we test the overall hypothesis that inhibitory SC
neurons, driven by local pre-motor output, mediate spatial choice by suppressing SC populations representing
competing targets. The premise for this hypothesis is supported by decades of foundational research in behaving
animal models and brain slices, and by our and others' recent work leveraging the behaving mouse model to
unify these two branches of research. In particular, in the previous funding cycle we found that inhibitory SC
neurons do not merely suppress local pre-motor output, but instead mediate spatial choice via long-range
projections.
 To test our overall hypothesis, In Aim 1, we examine how activating inhibitory SC neurons modulates
activity across both SCs, under baseline conditions in quiescent mice and in behaving mice performing an odor-
cued spatial choice task requiring selection of a left or right reward port. We then record and perturb specific
projection-based subtypes of inhibitory SC neurons during spatial choice. These experiments test the hypothesis
that inhibitory SC neurons shape activity at distal sites in the SC, providing a mechanism for selecting among
competing spatial goals. In Aim 2, we will determine the relationship between the activity of pre-motor SC
neurons and distally-projecting inhibitory SC neurons by recording and perturbing their activity during quiescence
and behavior. These experiments will test the hypothesis that pre-motor SC neurons inhibit activity in populations
representing distal targets by locally activating long-range inhibitory SC neurons.
 If successful, the outcome of this proposal will be the elucidation of the neural circuit basis for spatial
choice, a key basic function of the nervous system. In addition, our research will lay the groundwork for
elucidating how SC circuitry is extrinsically modulated by other brain regions to subserve goal-directed behavior."
11034254,"Project summary: Early evidence indicates an association between emotional (eudaimonic and hedonic) well-
being (EWB) and underlying brain processes, and that those processes change with both normal and
pathological brain aging. However, the nature of these associations, the mechanisms by which EWB and its
component domains change with brain aging, and how those changes may be associated with common
neuropathologies like Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD), are largely unexplored. The objective
of the Network for Emotional Well-being and Brain Aging (NEW Brain Aging) is to address priority area #2 –
mechanistic research on the role of emotional well-being in health – of RFA-AT-20-003, identifying and testing
mechanisms by which brain aging influences EWB and how EWB may impact risk for and progression of ADRD.
Synthesizing human and animal literature, our premise is that relationships between EWB and ADRD are
bidirectional – normal and pathological changes in aging brain influence EWB and EWB contributes to brain
health and illness, such as ADRD. Further, we hypothesize that the relationships between EWB and the brain
in older adults reflect aging-associated heterogeneity of brain (i.e., resilience, typical aging, or neuropathological
changes), and that they are mediated by processes of appraisal and adaptation. To do so we will form a national,
transdisciplinary collaborative that includes investigators representing research expertise in human and animal
neuroimaging, stress regulation, ADRD research, EWB, and computational/quantitative methods. With direction
of an Executive Committee and guided by an External Advisory Committee, NEW Brain Aging will undertake
these specific aims: (1) To build an inter-university and transdisciplinary collaborative of senior and junior
investigators interested in brain, aging, and EWB research from both human and animal fields; (2) To form a
series of time-limited workgroups with relevant experts in the field, each working over 1-2 years, to establish
priorities for NEW Brain Aging activities in each of three general areas: (a) brain mechanism research of EWB;
(b) research of EWB’s impact on ADRD; and (c) translational animal and cross-species brain research methods;
(3) To coalesce and coordinate resources to ensure the rigor and reproducibility of the brain-related EWB
research; (4) To provide three types of pilot funding through rigorous peer review: (a) pilot research grants for
junior faculty related to brain mechanism studies related to the relationship between EWB and dementia using
human or animal models; (b) proof-of-concept grants for established investigators to test aspects related to EWB
in their existing studies and cohorts of brain aging; (c) seed collaboration grants for cross-species brain research
related to EWB; (5) To evaluate the network by tracking its activities, resource usage, and productivity, and
conducting collaborative network density analysis throughout the 4-year grant; and (6) to ensure the wide
dissemination of NEW Brain Aging products. By accomplishing these aims, we will strengthen a research
network focusing on the brain mechanistic understanding of EWB and relationship between EWB and ADRD."

The goal of this supplement to R01 GM132460 will be to support the toolkit being developed under
the parent award through acquisition of a preparative HPLC instrument. The goal of the parent
R01 is to improve the practicality, generality, tunability and scope of tetrazine ligation. We will
develop a new generation of catalysts and reagents for tetrazine cross coupling and will apply
these tools to chemical glycobiology applications. We will continue to develop novel tetrazines
that can serve a dual role in enabling protein purification followed by subsequent site-selective
bioorthogonal chemistry, and we propose to develop efficient catalytic methods for ‘turning on’
rapid bioorthogonal chemistry in biological context. Mechanistic inquiry will continue to guide our
discovery efforts as will continued industrial collaboration with the chemical biology group at
Pfizer. Efforts to commercialize the tool molecules will be continued.
The success of this proposal is critically dependent on small molecule purification which is greatly
facilitated by preparative high performance liquid chromatography (prep-HPLC). Currently, the
Fox group does not have access to a prep-HPLC instrument. The proposed instrument will greatly
accelerate research and maximize the impact of this R01-funded program. All aims of this grant
will derive tremendous benefit from the proposed prep-HPLC."
11027970,"SUMMARY: Worldwide, up to 25% of premature infants born prior to 31 weeks gestation, and up to 50% of
those born prior to 28 weeks gestation, have neurodevelopmental impairment (NI). The causes of NI are
multifactorial, but neuroinflammation is now recognized as a key component. Early life stresses commonly
encountered by premature infants, including hypoxia, forced formula feeding, and hypothermia, have the
potential to trigger inflammation throughout the body. This inflammation can originate in the intestine, e.g. during
neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), where the microbiota incite a dysregulated inflammatory response.
Excessive inflammation in the periphery propagates neuroinflammation and subsequent long-term NI. We have
developed a novel, tunable probiotic delivery system in which the probiotic Limosilactobacillus reuteri (Lr) is
administered in a protective biofilm on biocompatible porous microspheres that provide Lr with cargos that induce
beneficial properties. Administration of Lr in this biofilm state reduces the incidence of NEC and subsequent
neuroinflammation in a rat model after just a single dose. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that
identifying the extent to which Lr antimicrobial and/or anti-inflammatory properties attenuates NI can be
leveraged to tune these Lr properties to optimally prevent, or even treat, NEC-induced NI. Studying the
neurodevelopmental impacts of optimized dosing regimens on both NEC and healthy control pups will
demonstrate the contributions of these properties towards not only preventing and treating NEC-induced NI, but
also healthy neurodevelopment. These studies are in line with the recent NOFO (PAR-23-130) for Translational
Research in Maternal and Pediatric Pharmacology and Therapeutics, where we intend to develop an FDA
approved probiotic formulation which can be administered to all premature infants at risk of developing NEC.
AIM 1: Determine the extent to which Lr antimicrobial pathways can prevent NEC-induced
neurodevelopmental impairment (NI). Bacterial dysbiosis can incite inflammatory responses in the periphery
and brain. We hypothesize that tuning Lr antimicrobial activity can prevent NEC-induced NI.
AIM 2: Determine the extent to which Lr anti-inflammatory pathways can prevent NEC-induced NI. We
will determine the extent to which Lr anti-inflammatory pathways prevent neuroinflammation and subsequent NI.
We hypothesize that tuning Lr anti-inflammatory properties can prevent NEC-induced NI.
AIM 3: Determine the dominant Lr-dependent pathways for the prevention and treatment of NI using all
proven cargos. We will determine whether Lr antimicrobial or anti-inflammatory pathways are dominant,
antagonistic, additive or synergistic in the prevention and treatment of NI. We hypothesize that tuning the best
combinations of Lr pathways can be used to both prevent and treat NEC-induced NI.
The significance of the proposed research is that it will lead to a better understanding of the ability of Lr to
prevent and treat NEC-induced NI, leading to improved novel therapeutic approaches."
11012027,"Approximately 11,000 new cases of cervical cancer were diagnosed in the US in 2018. While the cervical
cancer mortality rate declined, approximately 4,000 women still die from this disease every year. According to
Indian Health Service data from 1999-2009, Native American (NA) women had approximately a two-fold higher
incidence and associated mortality rate than White women. Hispanic and NA women have the highest rates of
cervical cancer in Arizona, with respectively, 7.8 and 7.1 cases per 100,000 women. While HPV is the known
etiologic agent of cervical cancer, few studies were conducted to estimate HPV prevalence within NA
communities. Among those studies, it was reported that 22.2% of NA women from the Hopi reservation in
northeastern Arizona tested positive for HPV infection. The deficiencies of both cervical screening and higher
HPV prevalence are likely contributors to cervical cancer disparities among NA women. Yet, evidence
suggests an association of HPV infection, persistence, and disease progression with vaginal microbiota (VMB)
features, which were reported to differ across socioeconomic or ethnic/racial groups. Despite differences in
cervical cancer rates between racial and ethnic groups, little is known about the patterns of HPV infection and
VMB composition in NA communities, or how these factors relate to increased cervical cancer risk. In fact,
most prior studies do not include NA women. We hypothesize that there are dual factors (Indigenous
perceptions and biological factors within the cervicovaginal microenvironment) that contribute to HPV
persistence and, ultimately, cervical cancer health disparities in Native women. For this 3-year full project, we
will continue working with the MedStar Health Research Institute in Phoenix, AZ. Thus, the aims of this project
are to (1) assess the knowledge and perspectives of cultural practices, HPV-associated cancers, and
STI knowledge among urban NA women, and (2) define changes in the vaginal microbiota and
immunometabolic milieu in a longitudinal study of urban NA women to better understand the
relationship between these factors and HPV infection, persistence, and clearance. From these aims, we
will (1) determine the prevalence of modifiable risk factors and behaviors for HPV infection and HPV-related
cancers among NA women; (2) assess knowledge and perceptions regarding HPV-related cancers among NA
women; (3) determine the individual HPV status, levels of vaginal inflammatory mediators, metabolites and the
VMB abundance in NA women across a longitudinal study; (4) evaluate the risk factors associated with
prevalent HPV types and the VMB; and (5) conduct integrated multi-omics analysis in NA women focused on
features of the local microenvironment associated with HPV status. Therefore, this 3-year full project will
include culturally-informed community-based biomedical research and apply Two Eyed Seeing as a
guiding principle with the long-term goal of reducing health disparities that impact NA communities that
are disproportionately affected by HPV-associated cancers."
11012032,"Cancer is the second leading cause of mortality for Native Americans.1 In Arizona (AZ), only the Navajo
Nation and the Hopi Tribe have Centers for Disease Control and Prevention funding through the National
Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program to provide breast and cervical cancer screening and
diagnostic services. The San Carlos Apache Tribe and the Tohono O’odham Nation use tribal funds to provide
cancer education. Despite the overwhelming need for cancer related services and the Partnership for Native
American Cancer Prevention’s (NACP) accomplishments in building program capacity, the remaining 18 of the
22 AZ Native Nations have no sustained cancer support programs or trained patient navigators to promote
screening, explain treatment options and support cancer patients and their families. This persistent gap is
linked to challenges in securing external funding and limited availability of patient navigation training specific to
Native American clients. In collaboration with tribes, NACP is well positioned to build on the expertise of the
Hopi Tribe and Navajo Nation to enhance capacity among other AZ Native communities ready for robust
cancer control programming to address structural and individual barriers to cancer care.
 The Outreach and Engagement Core’s (OEC) long-term goal is to strengthen AZ Native Nations’ capacity
and infrastructure to provide sustained, community-based cancer education, screening and care services to
advance cancer health equity. In the next cycle, OEC will continue integrating Indigenous and non-Indigenous
worldviews to leverage community assets to address community needs, an approach being adopted
throughout NACP called the two-eyed seeing approach.6 The objectives of the Core’s proposal are to: a)
enhance tribal health department expertise in cancer education and patient navigation through training, inter-
tribal, peer-program mentoring, and program development, and b) increase access to and application of
information generated by NACP funded research projects, as well as state and national resources. A guiding
principle of the OEC is collaboration, specifically the continuation and expansion of partnerships with
institutional partners, Native Nations and Native American-serving entities to build regional capacity through
coalition building, supporting tribes’ own efforts to bring cancer related services to their citizens, and mentoring
NACP investigative teams to disseminate relevant research results to Native Nations.
Aim 1. Enhance AZ Native Nations’ cancer patient navigation capacity through CHR training and
mentorship across the cancer care continuum.
Aim 2: Facilitate a national Intertribal cancer network to build programmatic knowledge, funding, and
infrastructure for AZ’s tribal cancer related activities.
Aim 3. Mentor and guide NACP research teams in effective community-based dissemination and
application of research activities through enhanced training."
11034356,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Interactions between mitochondrial (mtDNA) and nuclear (nDNA) genomes are essential for
maintaining mitochondrial and cellular functions. However, an age- and disease-associated increase of
heteroplasmic mtDNA (the presence of different mtDNA haplotypes) creates an inter-genomic mismatch that
perturbs mitonuclear interaction efficiency. Disrupted mitonuclear interaction results in mitochondrial
dysfunction, reduced organismal fitness, and initiation of various stress that has been associated with a
plethora of many human diseases, such as Huntington's disease, Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, and
type 2 diabetes mellitus. In response to disrupted mitonuclear interactions, cells activate stress response
pathways to remodel gene expression and metabolism, thereby maintaining mitochondrial function and
alleviating cellular stress. However, a detailed molecular understanding of mitonuclear mechanisms linking
activation of stress response pathways for maintaining mitochondrial function and stress resistance has been
understudied, representing a significant knowledge gap. I hypothesize that distinct mismatched mitonuclear
genomes maintain coordination of mitochondrial status with various stress response pathways to alleviate
harmful consequences of suboptimal mitonuclear interactions. To test this hypothesis, we developed a novel
yeast mitonuclear exchange model (cytoductants) by combining more than 100 mtDNA genotypes onto the
same nDNA genetic background, thereby generating an elegant system with various degrees of perturbation in
mitonuclear interaction and altered mitochondrial function. Overall, the main goal of our research is to
mechanistically understand how perturbations in mitonuclear interaction are transduced into biological effects.
My laboratory will build and sustain three research projects to accomplish this goal. We will first test the
hypothesis that understanding mitonuclear communication at molecular level will uncover distinct mitonuclear
responses to perturbed mitonuclear interactions. (Project 1). Secondly, we will identify the crosstalk between
stress response pathways and their downstream effectors in protecting cells from various stress under the
condition of perturbed mitonuclear interaction. Further, we will determine whether a specific type of stressor
determines the specificity of the response or not (Project 2). Finally, with an innovative cell engineering
approach, we will investigate the hypothesis that balancing cellular energy hemostasis can mitigate the effect
of disrupted mitonuclear interaction (Project 3). The proposed research is significant because it will uncover
how cells respond to disrupted mitonuclear interactions to maintain cellular homeostasis. Since many
mitochondrial diseases are carried in heteroplasmy, this basic research into the maintenance of mitonuclear
interaction will likely identify modulators of efficient mitochondrial interaction. It might be targeted
pharmacologically to treat human pathologies associated with mitonuclear dysfunction, such as
neurodegeneration and aging."

This submission by Hillary Lum, MD, PhD for the NIH Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented
Research (K24) enables Dr. Lum to: 1) mentor junior clinical investigators in dementia care research, and 2)
enhance the science of community-engaged research and co-design methods involving persons affected by
Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). Dr. Lum is a geriatrician, palliative medicine physician,
and prior Beeson Scholar with an independent ADRD research program, ADRD team-science collaborations, a
national reputation in ADRD palliative care research, and a strong record of grants and publications.
Mentorship: Over the last decade, Dr. Lum has mentored more than 30 residents, fellows, and junior clinical
investigators in geriatrics, palliative care, neurology, and other patient-oriented aging disciplines. She has
research mentorship leadership roles including serving as Co-Director of the NIA T32 Multidisciplinary
Palliative Care in Aging Post-Doctoral Fellowship Program and Associate Director of the NCATS Clinical
Faculty Scholars Program at the University of Colorado. Her mentoring objectives are to increase the pipeline
of ADRD and geriatric investigators who progress to independence, and to lead institutional and national
ADRD and geriatric patient-oriented research mentorship programs.
Research theme: Dr. Lum's research integrates community-engaged research and co-design methods into
real-world intervention design, testing, and implementation to improve care for persons living with dementia
and family care partners. Community-engaged research is the process of working collaboratively with patients
and others during conceptualization, conduct, and dissemination of research. Co-design methods, focusing on
developing interventions, are part of community engaged research. As an example of community-engaged
research in ADRD, Dr. Lum convened a “Memory Tech Council” of patients, care partners, and community
members to identify priorities for use of consumer health information technology embedded in the health
system to improve dementia care. This K24 proposal will provide Dr. Lum with protected time to advance the
science of engagement in ADRD by focusing on: 1) expanding capacity for junior investigators to integrate
engagement methods into their ADRD research; 2) identifying community-engaged research methods for
partnering with persons living with dementia and care partners; and 3) organizing co-design tools for dementia
care interventions into a new online resource for dementia care researchers.
Impact: Through this K24 award, Dr. Lum will enhance the science of engagement in ADRD, enhance her
mentorship through current and new research mentorship roles at University of Colorado and nationally, and
enhance the field through a pipeline of clinical investigators in ADRD and patient-oriented aging research.

Microscope system with a Coherent AXON 920-2 TPC laser will overcome
cost and access limitations. Additionally, it will enable computational
synchronization of infrared videos capturing the male's detection of the
female, triggering P1 GCaMP responses— a feature currently lacking in the
Core Facility's Leica DIVE SP2 system. In summary, the purchase of the
new system will significantly enhance our ability to record neural responses,
overcoming crucial limitations and ensuring the successful completion of
the project.
A key goal of Aim 1 is to identify changes in fru gene regulation by social experience and pheromone signaling
and its effects on courtship circuit function and behavioral outputs. Social isolation
increases activity in P1 courtship command neurons in the central brain, resulting
in heightened courtship behaviors toward females (Figs. 1 and 2). We found that
both fru and dsx show a general upregulation in gene expression in socially
isolated male brains (Fig. 3). However, single-cell RNAseq analysis from fru-
positive neurons in the central brain reveals only a few clusters where fru
expression is significantly influenced by social isolation (Fig. 4). To establish a
causal link between fru regulation and neural activity, we plan to conduct
knockdown or overexpression of fruM in neural clusters regulated by social
experience and assess their effects on P1 neuron activity and courtship in
grouped and isolated males.
 Our investigation into courtship behaviors in pheromone receptor mutants
revealed the involvement of neural circuits activated by Or47b neurons in
suppressing courtship after group housing (Fig. 5). To establish a causal link
between Or47b neural circuits and the modulation of courtship with social
experience, we aim to record GCaMP responses from P1 neurons in grouped and
isolated wild-type and Or47b mutant male brains. We will also examine males with Figure 4ed. Dot plot showing
 GH/SH log2fold change of some
either activated or silenced Or47b neurons. Given the crucial role of P1 neurons differentially expressed genes in
in initiating courtship, live imaging of GCaMP responses is critical and requires different fru-positive neural clusters.

 A key goal of Aim 2 is to identify changes in dsx gene regulation by social experience in wild type, fru and
pheromone receptor mutants and its effects on courtship circuit function and behavioral outputs. Isolated fru
mutants display no courtship, yet they learn to court when grouped with other Male-Female courtship
flies [5]. Interestingly, fru-dsx double mutants do not exhibit social experience-
dependent courtship learning [5]. We propose that social experience-
dependent transcriptional changes in fru mutants influence P1 neural activity
and courtship responses. Compared to wild-type males, fru mutants exhibit
increased dsx expression in grouped males and decreased expression in
isolation (Fig. 3). Additionally, we've identified socially regulated
neuromodulatory genes in wild-type and fru mutant brains (Fig. 3 and 4). We GH SH GH SH GH SH

regulated genes (e.g., dsx) and circuit responses, we will utilize the Ultima
Investigator Plus Laser Scanning Microscope system to record P1 neuron GCaMP responses in grouped and
isolated wild-type and fru mutant males, as well as fru mutants where candidate genes are genetically
manipulated.
 A key goal of Aim 3 is to identify changes in transcriptional profiles in the central brain in response to social
experience, pheromone signaling and FruM function, and their effect on courtship and courtship circuit activity.
Our recent RNAseq experiments revealed differential expression in genes related to courtship regulation,
synaptic plasticity, learning/memory, and neuromodulation in response to social experience and pheromone
circuit activity (Figs. 3 and 4) [8]. To establish causal links between gene expression modulation and neural
circuit activity regulated by social experience and pheromone circuit function, we plan to record GCaMP
responses in P1 courtship command neurons through various genetic experiments. This will enable the
establishment of causal links between genes transcriptionally regulated by social experience and pheromone
circuits, shedding light on the modulation of circuit and behavioral function. These experiments necessitate the
use of the Ultima Investigator Plus Laser Scanning Microscope system with Coherent AXON 920-2 TPC laser.

11034741,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), an adult onset motor neuron degenerative disease,
is increasingly recognized to have clinical, pathological and genetic overlaps with Frontotemporal
dementia (FTD). Dysfunction of RNA metabolisms has emerged to play crucial roles in disease
etiology. Pathological inclusions and/or genetic mutations in several RNA-binding proteins are
widely found in the two diseases. Alternatively, the hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the non-
coding region of C9ORF72 gene could also induce toxicity from the repeat RNA-derived products.
This supports the susceptibility of neurons to the dysfunction of RNA processing and the
importance of RNA homeostasis in preserving neuronal integrity. RNA modifications have recently
emerged to play important roles in posttranscriptional gene regulation. N6-methyladenosine (m6A)
is by far the most abundant internal RNA modification of eukaryotic cells. m6A modification is
dynamic and reversible, providing an additional layer of regulation on RNA. It is noted that m6A is
most enriched and the methylome is highly specific in the nervous system compared to other
tissues. Emerging studies indicate the important roles of m6A in regulating brain function, from
development to synaptic plasticity, learning and memory, and neurodegeneration. But it has not
been explored in ALS/FTD or other neurodegenerative diseases.
 The hexanucleotide GGGGCC repeat expansion located in the first intron of the C9ORF72
gene is the most common cause of both ALS and FTD. The leading hypothesis for the disease
mechanism is gain of toxicity from the expanded repeats, with two non-mutually exclusive
mechanisms: 1) RNA foci formed by repeats that could sequester RNA binding proteins and
disrupt RNA processing; and 2) accumulation of dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs) produced by
repeat-associated non-AUG translation (RAN translation). Our lab recently identified that m6A
RNA methylation can affect the DPR levels produced from the repeats. Furthermore, we also
found that the m6A pathway is profoundly reduced in C9ORF72-ALS/FTD patient neurons.
Therefore, it is important to determine the molecular mechanisms on how the m6A dysregulation
changes the repeat RNA metabolisms and disturbs the global mRNA processing, and how this
contributes to the neuronal dysfunction and degeneration in C9ORF72-ALS/FTD. Furthermore,
we will also determine whether targeting specific components in the m6A pathway can rescue the
disease-related phenotypes. This study addresses an emerging theme of RNA regulation that has
not been explored in neurodegeneration. The findings will help understanding the etiology of the
disease and developing novel therapeutic strategies for ALS and FTD."

The primary goal of our funded research (R01GM141242) is to understand how the chromosome is organized
and segregated during the cell cycle. We focus on the molecular mechanisms of SMC condensin complex, which
is a key player for chromosome dynamics from bacteria to humans. Our projects combine genetic, molecular,
cytological, and biochemical approaches. The Aim 2 of this grant is to understand the mechanism by which SMC
is unloaded from the chromosome by its unloader, XerD. To address this question, we use purified proteins and
investigate protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions. For our protein purification and protein interaction
assays, a chromatography system is an essential piece of equipment. In the past, we had been using an AKTA
chromatography system in our collaborator Dr Martha Oakley’s lab. However, Dr Oakley has closed her research
lab and this equipment is no longer available to us. Since the biochemical assays are critical to the progress of
my R01 grant, in this application for Administrative Supplements for Equipment, I am requesting funds to
purchase an AKTA chromatography system (and necessary parts) for my own lab. Moreover, this proposed
equipment has features that can expand our biochemical assays and allow us to adapt new methods to advance

The project ""Evolutionary Pathways of Memory: Multiomic Analysis of the Entorhinal Cortex across Mammals""
focuses on the entorhinal cortex (EC), a pivotal region for episodic memory and spatial navigation that is essential
for survival and adaptive behavior across species. The EC integrates information from the neocortex, which is
then relayed to the hippocampus, playing a crucial role in the consolidation and retrieval of memories. Its
evolutionary significance and vulnerability to neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's, make it a
focal point for understanding the evolution of cognitive functions and disease mechanisms. This proposal aims
to systematically compare the EC across 14 mammalian species, using state-of-the-art single-cell genomics and
spatial transcriptomics to elucidate the cellular composition, gene expression patterns, and regulatory
landscapes that have evolved over approximately 180 million years.
The research plan is structured to dissect the evolutionary conservation and divergence of cell types within the
EC, identify species-specific adaptations, and uncover the molecular underpinnings of these processes. By
integrating single-nucleus RNA sequencing, ATAC sequencing for chromatin accessibility, and spatially resolved
transcriptomics, the project will generate comprehensive cell type atlases that highlight evolutionary trends in
neuronal and non-neuronal cells. This multi-layered analysis will help identify conserved genetic circuits critical
for memory and navigation, and human-specific alterations that may be relevant to neurological diseases.
A significant component of this proposal is the dedicated mentorship and training plan for Jessie Puckett. As an
emerging scientist, Jessie will be immersed in a multidisciplinary training program that includes hands-on
experience in advanced genomic technologies, computational data analysis, and evolutionary biology.
Mentorship will be provided by leading experts in genomics, neuroscience, and bioinformatics, ensuring a broad
and deep educational experience. Regular progress meetings, workshops on scientific communication, and
opportunities to present findings at conferences will further enhance Jessie's professional development. This
mentorship strategy is designed not only to advance the project's aims but also to equip Jessie with a diverse
analytical skill set and biological background, positioning her for a successful career in the biomedical sciences.
This project brings together evolutionary biology, genomics, and computational analysis to explore key aspects
of brain cellular architecture. Through its ambitious research objectives and comprehensive training program, it
aims to generate novel insights into the evolutionary adaptations of the entorhinal cortex, while fostering the
growth of an adept and innovative scientist."
11033708,"Abstract
Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is the most abundant phospholipid in eukaryotic cells. It serves as a structural
component of cellular membranes and a reservoir of lipid second messengers. PC is made de novo by two
primary routes: the CDP-choline branch of the Kennedy pathway and the PE methylation pathway. We recently
characterized a third route in which the PC molecule is remodeled, as its fatty acyl groups are subject to a
deacylation/reacylation pathway (PC-DRP). Importantly, alterations in PC synthesis, turnover and remodeling
are associated with cellular malfunctions and disease states. PC-DRP involves complete deacylation of PC via
phospholipases (Plb1, Nte1) that produce glycerophosphocholine (GPC) and successive acyl-CoA-dependent
acyltransferase reactions that convert GPC à lysoPC à PC, as catalyzed by Gpc1 and Ale1. Gpc1, which
catalyzes the committed step in the reacylation sequence and was discovered in our laboratory, provides the
cell with i) a 2-step PC resynthesis route and ii) a means by which both PC acyl chains can be post-synthetically
remodeled. Acyl chain content is crucial to cell function, as it affects fundamental membrane properties such as
fluidity and curvature. In the previous grant period, we confirmed the role of Gpc1 in PC metabolism in S.
cerevisiae and found that loss of Gpc1 results in a decrease in mono-unsaturated PC species and an increase
in di-unsaturated PC species, thus confirming the role for PC-DRP in PC remodeling. The Unfolded Protein
Response (UPR) is a signaling pathway responsive not only to unfolded proteins, but also ER bilayer stress. We
have shown that Gpc1 is a key player in ER membrane bilayer homeostasis: its transcription is increased upon
induction of the UPR and deletion of Gpc1 results in UPR induction. Strains bearing a deletion in GPC1 (gpc1D
mutants) display other phenotypes, including decreased stationary phase viability and decreased sensitivity to
growth at elevated temperature. Some of the observed phenotypes may be unrelated to acyltransferase activity,
as Gpc1 also exhibits a lesser transacylase activity and, like other enzymes, may have cellular functions
unrelated to catalysis. Gpc1 bears no sequence similarity to known acyltransferases or transacylases, and has
been designated a new protein family (UniProtKB - P48236). Gpc1 homologs are lacking in vertebrates but are
found in other organisms, including medically important pathogenic fungi. Our published finding that transport of
the Gpc1 substrate, GPC, into C. albicans is required for full virulence of the organism, underlines the importance
of examining enzymes, like Gpc1, that utilize GPC. Our objective is to use targeted mutagenesis to identify key
amino acid residues required for Gpc1 acyltransferase activity. The catalytically-compromised mutant(s) will be
used to elucidate the importance of acyltransferase activity to phenotypes associated with loss of the protein.
In addition, we will interrogate the importance of the PC remodeling aspect of Gpc1 by examining its regulation
in response to changes in membrane saturation. The research will be performed with the genetically tractable
S. cerevisiae. The requested Sapphire FL Biomolecular Imager provides enhanced capabilities for the
performance of research essential to the grant."

 PROJECT SUMMARY
 What if healthcare providers were equipped with biocompatible, biodegradable, robust, and affordable
treatment options that combine therapeutic modalities with controlled mechanisms of action? What if this
versatile technology had learning capacity and could be educated to recognize patient-specific diseases and
interfere with their progression by redirecting fundamental cellular processes? What if the very same formulation
could offer an additional means of control over patients’ immune responses and further advance favorable
therapeutic outcomes with minimal toxicities? These next generation therapies would then become a game
changer in helping to prevent, detect, diagnose, and treat diseases and disabilities at their source. With the
support from MIRA (R35) funding, we envision a data-driven platform, SMART NANPs (specific, modular,
adjustable, reproducible, and targeted nucleic acid nanoparticles), encoded by self-assembling nucleic acids. By
controlling the flow of genetic information across all forms of life, nucleic acids have become instrumental in
acquiring new knowledge about major cellular processes and origins of diseases. Besides their diverse biological
roles, these biopolymers can be programmed into NANPs with specified physicochemical properties and
functionalities that dictate NANPs’ biological actions with endless possibilities for reprogramming cellular
behavior through molecular signaling. We recently discovered that different architectural parameters and
compositions of NANPs, delivered to primary human immune cells, can activate monocytes and dendritic cells
to produce type I and type III interferons. This pioneering work on NANPs’ immunorecognition highlighted an
unforeseen clinical application for this technology in the field of vaccines and immunotherapy. A defined
structure-function relationship for any given NANP would then allow conditional actuation of its
immunorecognition or any other therapeutic activity through a set of embedded architectural codes. With this
notion, we introduced two orthogonal concepts of therapeutic NANPs which can be conditionally activated in
human cancer cells to release pre-programmed therapeutics. By uniting these breakthroughs and other
preliminary findings from my lab, as highlighted in the current application, and integrating them into a unified
network of SMART NANPs with programmable control of biodistribution, immunological activity, and therapeutic
modules, we will advance the current repertoire of therapies against infectious diseases and cancers (through
NANP-based vaccines and immunotherapies), cardiovascular diseases (through regulated coagulation by
thrombin-targeting NANPs), and address drug overdose and safety issues (through the biodegradable nature of
NANPs and their controlled deactivation). To maximize the successful translation of this technology, the
proposed program will employ a multidisciplinary approach that spans the fields of nucleic acid nanotechnology,
immunology, drug delivery, translational oncology, and machine learning. The long-term goal of this program is
to elevate SMART NANPs to the level of clinical use."

The overarching goal of our research is to understand the mechanisms of helicases and polymerases in
processes such as viral RNA recognition, DNA transcription, and replication. The unifying approach is the
quantitative characterization of the enzymatic reactions using rigorous biochemical and biophysical methods
such as transient state kinetics, single-molecule kinetics, computational kinetic modeling, and cryo-electron
microscopy. The integration of structural and functional studies allows the development of a complete
mechanistic picture. In project 1, we are studying viral RNA recognition by RIG-I like receptors which are
helicases serving as the first responders of viral RNA infections. The RIG-I like receptors recognize pathogen-
associated molecular patterns on viral genomes and replication intermediates and respond by triggering an
immune response to create an antiviral state. Our research focuses on understanding the mechanisms of RNA
recognition and ATPase/helicase functions of RIG-I like receptors using biochemical, structural, and cell-
signaling assays. We are elucidating the intrinsic mechanisms in RIG-I that enable self versus non-self
recognition and developing new strategies to understand how they are activated and regulated. In project 2,
we are studying the mechanism and regulation of mitochondrial DNA transcription catalyzed by RNA
polymerases that resemble phage T7 but regulated by transcription factors. Transcription initiation and
transition into elongation are key stages that are regulated by transcription factors. We are using cryo-electron
microscopy, and ensemble/single-molecule kinetics to elucidate the structure and dynamics at these stages of
transcription using in vitro reconstituted yeast and human mitochondrial RNA polymerases. In project 3, we
are studying the mechanism of DNA replication by phage T7 and human mitochondrial replisomes. We study
how helicase and polymerase work together to catalyze strand-displacement DNA synthesis, in particular, how
they are energetically coupled. We are studying the mechanism of DNA synthesis by mitochondrial DNA
polymerase to understand the role of helicase, Twinkle, and mitochondrial single-strand binding protein. An in-
depth understanding of the enzymatic mechanisms is critically necessary to understand mitochondrial DNA
deletions caused by defects in helicase and polymerase. This research will provide the mechanistic framework
to quantitatively model the reactions of replication, transcription, and pathogen recognition that will guide in the
development of therapies for viral infections, cancer, mitochondrial diseases."

Project Title: Maximizing hearing recovery from peri-synaptic damage
Program Summary
 Ototoxicants such as aminoglycoside antibiotics, and anti-neoplastic cisplatin, cause cytoplasmic
stress within the sensory hair cells and the spiral ganglion neurons, affecting synaptic functionalities and
signal transmission towards the central auditory system. We hypothesize that ototoxic cochlear synaptic
damage that to some extent resembles noise-induced synaptopathy, accounts for the observation that
after various ototoxic insults, within particular dosing range, without effective intervention, the auditory
functions deteriorate permanently, despite of minimal or no hair cell loss. Thus, in the present project,
we will investigate the similarity and discrepancy of synaptic damage due to noise or aminoglycosides
and decipher the cause of synaptopathy at cellular and molecular levels.
 The proposed project is designed to investigate the aminoglycoside treatment conditions, which
result in classic synaptopathy, and to search for optimal therapeutic temporal windows and candidate
agents to intervene with degeneration process. In this manner, study findings will permit maximal hearing
recovery after either noise over-stimulation or exposure to ototoxic insults. The specific aims of this
project are to:
 First, determine the optimal aminoglycoside dosage that produces maximal ototoxic synaptopathy
without functional hair cell damage in CBA/CaJ mice. An established 14-day gentamicin protocol will be
used, with various dosing strategy. Electrophysiological and acoustical measures, including auditory
brainstem responses (ABRs) and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), will be used to
assess post-synaptic (ABR) and pre-synaptic (DPOAE) outer hair cell function, respectively.
 Second, using the optimal gentamicin dosing, we will characterize the dynamic synaptic modification
in ototoxic synaptopathy. Here, we will conduct morphological investigation to visualize the synaptic
variation and the survival of spiral ganglion neurons at multiple time points after the initiation of
gentamicin treatment.
 Third, we will determine the effects of cochlear inflammation on synaptic damage, using genetically
modified mouse models including Darc and TrpV1 knockout mice. Both strains of mice present certain
degree of resistance to noise-induced hearing loss.
 Last, we will test potential audiologic rehabilitation strategies for synaptopathy, focusing on
inflammation suppressive corticosteroids. This is the major rehabilitation component of the project, we
will perform intratympanic injection of several therapeutics in the models of ototoxic and noise-induced
synaptopathy. Auditory function will be assessed by ABR and DPOAE at several post-treatment time
points, and synaptic element examined by immunolabeling and microscopy.
 Cochlear synaptopathy plays an essential role in auditory damage, likely affecting the supra-
threshold auditory functions. These functions are critical for frequency selectivity and temporal
processing, both important for speech understanding and listening in the noise environment. This
creates an extreme adverse situation in military settings when effective interpersonal communication
means life-or-death, and greatly affects the life quality of Veterans. This research proposal is ultimately
to improve the effectiveness of rehabilitation from synaptic damage in the inner ear."

If no preventative measures are developed, the number of individuals suffering from Alzheimer’s Disease (AD)
is expected to triple by 2050; many of whom will be members of a minority group. Ethnic and racial disparities
in Alzheimer’s disease exist; however, these disparities are severely understudied, especially amongst African
Americans. The consequent need for less invasive and more cost-effective tools to identify stages of AD at an
earlier and perhaps more treatable time-point has fueled research into plasma biomarkers. Neural (NDEs) and
astrocyte-derived exosomes (ADEs) have demonstrated biomarker potential for detecting stages of AD and
predicting the conversion of MCI to AD. Although the field has been focused on NDEs and ADEs, there are
surprisingly no published reports demonstrating the biomarker potential of microglial derived exosomes
(MDEs). Any potential value of plasma exosome cargo to accurately identify stages of MCI and predict the
conversion of MCI to AD, will require additional validation studies that specifically account for ethnic and racial
differences amongst its patient cohorts. Understanding how ethnic and racial factors modify AD risk can yield
new insights into race-dependent biological mechanisms, which in turn, can inform future diagnostic and
therapeutic interventions. With the existing infrastructure at my home institution (UCSD), reagents and
combined expertise of my mentor and collaborators, I will use a multidisciplinary approach to accomplish my
research objectives. In the mentored phase of this proposal, I will be trained in unbiased, Mass spectrometry
(MS)-based proteomic profiling for novel biomarker identification. My mentored studies will also involve the
purification and characterization of MDEs. Lastly, I will also use these samples to study the diagnostic and
prognostic utility of ADE and MDE cargo proteins (e.g. Aβ and p-tau) to predict conversion of MCI to AD.
During the independent phase, I will apply the methods and perspectives learned in the mentored phase of this
application to cross-validate the biomarker potential of plasma exosomes in a live cohort of African American
patients who are at risk for developing AD. Successful completion of this study will significantly advance the
field of exosome biology in neurodegeneration and may lead to the identification of novel biological targets for
therapeutic development of AD. The training and mentorship that I will receive because of this funding award
will undoubtedly contribute to my productivity as an independent scientist. Moreover, the K99/R00 mechanism
will provide with the support necessary to advance of establishing an NIH- R01 funded, independent laboratory
where I plan to continue my studies in racial disparities, exosome biology and biomarker discovery."

The lipid composition of cell membranes controls bilayer permeability and fluidity as well as the folding and
activity of integral membrane proteins, which comprise ~30% of the human proteome. Consequently, the lipid
composition of membranes is subject to tight homeostatic control. Over the past 60 years, we have learned a
tremendous amount about membrane lipid cell biology, largely from model organisms because forward
genetics in cultured human cells remained challenging. CRISPR technology now permits a direct examination
of these cellular functions in human cells, opening up a new era of mammalian cell genetics.
Our MIRA research strategy is to apply mammalian cell genetics to long-standing questions in cell biology,
specifically focusing on the regulation of membrane lipid homeostasis. Over the next 5 years, we will use
genetics to address two challenges. For Challenge #1, we will identify new regulators of plasma membrane
lipid composition. For Challenge #2, we will discover the mechanism of lysosomal fatty acid export by
characterizing genes required for the assimilation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-derived fatty acids.
Overall, these proposed MIRA studies will make fundamental contributions to the fields of membrane biology,
intracellular lipid transport, LDL receptor function/endocytosis, the SREBP pathway, and regulation of lipid
synthesis. Given that modulation of cholesterol synthesis and LDL receptor function are primary interventions
in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, these studies may identify new therapeutic targets for the prevention
of heart disease, a leading killer of adults in the United States."
11035397,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 For a protein-coding gene to perform its cellular function, it must first generate RNA transcripts that are
expressed at the appropriate level and properly processed. This is no small feat when one considers that RNA
polymerase II can prematurely terminate and that nascent transcripts can be acted upon by a variety of RNA
processing machines, including ones that yield mature transcripts lacking a canonical 5’ cap or 3’ poly(A) tail. A
major focus of our laboratory has thus been to identify and characterize novel “non-canonical” processing
pathways that can act on nascent RNAs. Here, we propose to build upon our recent work to study two such
mechanisms that are widely employed across eukaryotic genomes. First, we will mechanistically dissect how
the Integrator (Int) complex catalyzes premature transcription termination at hundreds of protein-coding
genes. Integrator was long known to be critical for the biogenesis of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), but we
recently showed that Integrator also binds to many protein-coding loci and attenuates production of their full-
length mRNAs, in some cases by more than 100-fold. This is because the IntS11 RNA endonuclease directly
cleaves nascent mRNAs, triggering degradation of the transcripts and premature transcription termination.
Nevertheless, it remains poorly understood how Integrator is assembled, regulated, and recruited to protein-
coding genes as most of the other subunits in the complex have no known function and lack obvious paralogs
or known protein domains. Our preliminary data indicate that non-catalytic Integrator subunits have distinct
roles at snRNA vs. protein-coding gene loci, and thus we will characterize in detail how these subunits are
recruited and function. Crosslinking mass spectrometry will further be used to define physical interfaces
between Integrator subunits, thereby revealing novel insights into how Integrator is globally assembled and
controlled. Second, we will investigate why many protein-coding genes generate circular RNAs with
covalently linked ends. Some of these non-canonical transcripts are greater than 10-fold more abundant than
their associated linear mRNAs. This suggests the main function of these genes may be to produce circular
RNAs, but the physiological functions of almost all mature circular RNAs remain unknown. We thus will use
high-throughput screening coupled to detailed biochemical studies to identify critical functions for circular RNAs
and their underlying molecular mechanisms. We further will systematically identify factors that modulate
circular RNA levels, especially post-transcriptionally, as very little is currently known about how the fate and
decay rates of these transcripts are controlled. Characterization of these key regulatory mechanisms will not
only provide important insights into endogenous circular RNAs, but may also ultimately enable circular RNAs to
become novel long-lasting therapeutic modalities. In total, these innovative studies will reveal new,
fundamental insights into how the Integrator complex and circular RNAs are regulated and control protein-
coding gene outputs to impact normal and diseased states."

(From the original application) Coordinated regulation of protein synthesis, trafficking, post-translational
modification and degradation is a basic requirement for cellular function. Targeted protein degradation in
eukaryotic cells is largely carried out by the proteasome. The proteasome allows dynamic regulation of protein
stability and enforces protein quality control by removing defective proteins. Importantly, demand for protein
degradation by the proteasome within individual cells can vary due to endogenous signals or exogenous
stressors. Thus, condition-specific regulation of proteasome capacity to maintain adequate, but avoid
excessive, protein degradation is needed to ensure normal development and physiology. Failure to
appropriately regulate the proteasome is implicated in disease. For example, deficient proteasome capacity is
associated with neurodegenerative conditions, whereas proteasome levels and activity are often elevated in
cancerous cells. We do not understand how cells dynamically maintain appropriate proteasome capacity to
meet changing cellular needs. Critically, we do not understand how the failure or hyperactivity of these
mechanisms contributes to disease. Here I propose a forward genetic approach in C. elegans to discover the
factors that control proteasome capacity, understand how they work at the molecular level, uncover their roles
in normal development, and begin to identify how they may mitigate or contribute to disease. We will (1) use
simple GFP-based reporter assays to perform large-scale genetic screens that will comprehensively identify
proteasome capacity regulators and (2) characterize novel proteasome regulators we have discovered through
these screens. (3) We will uncover how alterations to specific proteasome subunits differentially alter protein
degradation capacity, development, and proteasome inhibitor resistance. This work will improve our
understanding of the fundamental cellular mechanisms that regulate proteasome capacity in a whole animal
context. In the long-term, these insights will form the conceptual basis for pharmacological interventions that
improve human health via modulation of cellular protein degradation capacity."

 Heterocycles account for more than 50% of all known organic compounds. Their rich
activities in biological systems are important for pharmaceuticals and natural products. Among
the top 200 brand name drugs, over 75% are heterocyclic compounds. In nature, heterocycles
are active components for defense, communication, and reproduction. Low regioselectivities,
low stereo-/enantioselectivities, lengthy synthetic sequences, and low overall yields in most
multi-step syntheses make it extremely challenging to provide sufficient quantities of desired
bioactive heterocycles for therapeutic purposes. This NIH SuRE proposal aims to develop and
utilize highly selective metal catalyzed carbon carbon bond formation reactions that will lead to
efficient synthesis of novel selenium, sulfur, and oxygen-containing heterocycles with rich
biological activities. This proposal also aims to develop multicomponent coupling processes for
rapid generation of functionality and complexity in heterocycles, a new selective merged
asymmetric conjugate addition-acylation as well as a merged conjugate addition-oxidation
strategy that will lead to the synthesis of new classes of bioactive selenium, sulfur-containing
heterocycles. The proposed new C-C bond formations and multicomponent reactions will
provide new opportunities for complex novel heterocycle synthesis including selenium-
heterocycles. The metal-catalyzed conjugate addition of nucleophiles onto polyenic Michael
acceptors is one of the most attractive and powerful C-C bond forming strategies for synthesis
of relevant molecules, as it provides opportunity for sequential generation of two or more
stereogenic centers in a straightforward fashion. The multicomponent reactions enabled by
direct trapping of metal enolates could provide powerful transformations for the formation of
multiple C-C bonds and chiral centers in a single pot. The resultant versatile heterocyclic
subunits and trapping of the metal enolates in situ will provide excellent opportunities for new
innovative approaches for novel complex heterocyle synthesis and drug discovery. Further
elaboration of this chemistry will likely allow the first enantioselective synthesis of very
important classes of heterocycles such as biselenoflavonoids, bithioflavonoids and bioactive
biflavonoids, potential small molecule therapeutics for Alzheimer’s disease. This SuRE project

 Ranging from penicillin to artemisinin, natural products have been essential in the discovery and
development of new drugs. To complement the traditional activity-guided isolation approaches, genome mining
techniques can enable an efficient and high throughput discovery pipeline by specifically targeting promising
organisms and gene clusters for detailed study. However, detailed understanding of a biosynthetic pathway is
typically needed, significantly constraining the search process. Therefore, alternative bioinformatic approaches
combined with detailed biochemical characterization and bioactivity studies will help expand our collective
understanding of bioactive secondary metabolites in nature and their value for human health.
 The overall focus of the Chekan lab is to utilize enzyme-independent genome mining as a guide to enable
the discovery and detailed study of new types of bioactive natural products and biosynthetic pathways. This
proposal focuses on the ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide (RiPP) family of
natural products. RiPPs are a ubiquitous family of natural products found across all domains of life and possess
a wide range of bioactivities, with antibiotic activity being particularly well represented. These natural products
all share a consistent biosynthetic logic, but can be generated from a wide variety of biosynthetic enzymes. In
order to discover completely new classes of RiPPs, we propose to exploit conserved biosynthetic and structural
features instead of specific enzymatic transformations. This will allow for rapid in silico identification of promising
biosynthetic gene clusters that generate never before isolated molecules. To fully study and characterize these
new pathways, a combination of biochemical and structural approaches will be employed. These results will give
important insights into the new biosynthetic enzymes, reveal their mechanisms, and assess their applicability for
engineering. Finally, this first project will reveal the bioactivity of the newly discovered natural products and their
mechanism of action. To complement this discovery element, a second project will seek to link peptidic natural
product families, for which no biosynthetic information is available, to their biosynthetic enzymes. This proposal
will also enable the training of both graduate students and postdocs, the next generation of scientists responsible
for advancing human health. Overall, the results of this proposal will not only lead to the discovery of new natural
products and enzymes, but will inform future genome mining based discovery studies and pathway engineering
efforts to identify promising drug leads."

Genome integrity depends on a robust DNA replication program and the activity of replication-coupled repair
pathways that operate during different phases of the cell cycle. My laboratory has had a longstanding interest in
the causes and consequences of replication stress. Replication stress arises when lesions in the genome persist
due to repair deficiencies or when components of the replication machinery are dysfunctional. Although disease-
causing mutations in essential replication factors are rare, they can cause pleiotropic and severe disorders, such
as immunodeficiency, cardiomyopathy, or growth defects. In recent years, we have investigated the molecular
mechanism that underlies these rare diseases. We have identified compound heterozygous patient mutations in
the replication factor minichromosome maintenance protein 10 (MCM10), and have modeled them in human
somatic cell lines. Although these mutations cause relatively mild cellular replication defects, they pose
significant problems to telomere maintenance. One caveat of the current cell models is that they are immortalized
and express telomerase constitutively. To better understand the impact of replication defects in the context of
cellular development of affected tissues, we propose to engineer genome-edited induced pluripotent stem cells
and differentiate them into specific cell types in vitro. This presents a valuable alternative to animal models which,
relevantly, do not fully mimic telomere homeostasis in humans. Moreover, we are interested in the pathways that
cells activate for survival under conditions of mild replication stress. Previous work has identified a network based
on ubiquitination and SUMOylation, and ring finger protein 4 (RNF4) as a key component. RNF4 is a SUMO-
targeted E3 ubiquitin ligase that has been implicated in double-strand break repair, however, its role at replication
forks and in telomere maintenance is not well understood. A genetic interaction screen has identified Bloom
helicase (BLM), a RecQ-family helicase that causes premature aging, and ubiquitin specific peptidase 7 (USP7),
a deubiquitinase, as strong negative interactors. Mutations in USP7 have been linked to rare
neurodevelopmental disorders, but its cellular action has remained obscure. Interestingly, USP7 and BLM also
regulate DNA replication and telomere length. We will investigate the relationship between RNF4, USP7 and
BLM in chromosome inheritance in telomerase-positive and -negative cells. Lastly, a common feature of
replication stress is under-replication due to an inability to duplicate the entire genome. As a result, single-
stranded gaps persist that can either be filled by post-replicative repair that is regulated by the ubiquitination of
PCNA or, as a last resort, by mitotic DNA synthesis (MiDAS). MiDAS is a break-induced replication (BIR)-like
pathway that, unlike a classical replication fork, copies DNA by displacement synthesis. We will study how
ubiquitinated PCNA controls MiDAS, and will determine whether other BIR-related pathways are regulated by
PCNA ubiquitination. In summary, the questions addressed in this proposal will elucidate fundamental and
disease-relevant mechanisms of genome stability pathways in human cells."
11034723,"Project Summary
The long-term goal of our research program is to understand and identify the mechanisms of cell shape
dynamics that facilitate the emergence of tissue-wide patterns from local cell-cell communication events. The
incorrect spatial and temporal induction of genes and cell behaviors by perturbed signaling can lead to
catastrophic errors in development. Therefore, it is critical to understand how signaling mechanisms that take
place at the level of a cell or adjacent cells are coordinated across larger tissue length scales to achieve robust
patterns and support tissue homeostasis. Cytonemes, or signaling filopodia, are long actin-rich cellular
protrusions that allow cells to physically interact with, and signal to, other cells at a distance. Cellular
protrusions like cytonemes have been shown to play a role in many developmental processes, including spot
and stripe patterning, limb patterning, stem cell niche maintenance, and neural plate patterning. Despite this,
relatively little is known about the general mechanisms that regulate cytoneme-specific formation and behavior.
We are interested in understanding how these protrusions are regulated both at the level of cytoskeletal
mechanisms, and as an integrated part of the cell-wide and tissue-wide signaling states. To address this
problem, we use the spot pattern of bristles on the dorsal thorax of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as a
model system. During bristle patterning, cytonemes extend from the basal surface of thoracic epithelial cells to
facilitate long-range, Notch-mediated, lateral inhibition. Leveraging our strengths in Drosophila model systems
genetics and quantitative live microscopy, over the next five years our goals include understanding how the
formation of cytonemes are regulated, especially downstream of Notch-mediated lateral inhibition signaling. In
parallel, we aim to understand how cytoneme activity contributes to cell and tissue heterogeneities that
facilitate the timely formation of well-organized patterns. These studies will not only yield valuable cell
biological knowledge about the specific regulation of cytonemes, but will also elucidate fundamental
mechanisms that coordinate patterning across length scales."

Contemporary large-scale NIH initiatives have led to the emergence of many high-quality publicly available
longitudinal datasets that that include complex data of various types, sources, and domains (e.g., biological,
social, individual, family, neighborhood, etc.). However, use of these datasets without training can lead to
scientific setbacks, including work that is imperfect, misleading, or even incorrect. There is an urgent need for
educational programming to train researchers both within and outside of academic careers on the innovative
and responsible use of publicly available, large, and complex longitudinal datasets. This R25 application is to
develop and offer an “Interdisciplinary Summer Institute on the Analysis of Complex, Large-Scale Longitudinal
Data”, refining it each year based on evaluation data (aim 1). We will also leverage this program to train
graduate students to teach advanced longitudinal methods to participants from multiple disciplines (aim 2).
Thus, we will serve two groups: program participants (aim 1), and Purdue graduate student teaching assistants
(TAs, aim 2). During an immersive week-long summer institute each year, we will train 50 interdisciplinary
participants including students, postdocs and faculty across academic institutions (Y1-Y3), expanding to also
include professionals in non-profits, governmental agencies, and industries (Y2, Y3). The course is organized
in 10 topics: publicly available longitudinal data sources, introduction to longitudinal data analytic methods,
data visualization, missing data, longitudinal categorical data analysis, sampling weights and clustering/
stratification, time varying and time-invariant covariate inclusion, combining multiple data sources, embedded
family-based designs, and an intro to sociogenomics—emphasizing cross-cutting themes of data management,
visualization and communication, causal inference, measurement and modeling decisions, meaningful effect
sizes, and representativeness. Lecture examples and assignments will focus on substance use and associated
factors and will use the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development study data, although participants will be
encouraged to use whatever dataset is most relevant to their own research interests. The summer institute will
also feature TAs and additional faculty instructors circulating the room in each session to support students in
need of extra assistance in real-time, as well as review and office hour sessions, experience in interdisciplinary
environments, networking, and joint practice opportunities to help establish collaborations. We will also train 6
graduate student TAs each year, who will gain supervised experience in content development, instruction (via
review sessions), consulting, course evaluation, and leadership within interdisciplinary environments. We have
carefully designed recruitment strategies to train a diverse (e.g., under-represented groups, discipline, and
career stage and path) workforce, and a multi-pronged evaluation plan. Our program faculty includes 8 faculty
experts in longitudinal data analysis and instruction, representing different fields, genders, and career stages."
11031913,"Project Summary/Abstract
Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs), particularly carbapenem-resistant organisms (CROs),
are a major cause of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). Though studies have found
multiple interventions addressing MDRO colonization and transmission to be effective at
reducing HAIs, implementation has lagged due to uncertainty regarding the most efficacious
combinations of interventions. As patients are connected within healthcare facilities by the
movement of healthcare workers (HCWs) and mobile equipment, evaluation of an intervention's
impact on transmission and infection must consider these network dynamics. Additionally, each
institution has its own staffing ratios, equipment management, and cleaning practices that
inform the efficacy of an intervention. To address knowledge gaps regarding the most effective
combinations of intervention strategies at an individual hospital, we will build a model
framework that will provide hospital administrators and infection control experts with tools for
quantifying individual patient risk factors for colonization and infection and for comparing the
potential effectiveness of interventions to control HAIs. The aims of the project are: (1) to
develop models to predict which patients are at highest risk for colonization and infection with
MDROs using clinically relevant information collected during the normal course of care
combined with operational data on staffing and equipment movement; (2) to utilize hospital-
level models to quantify the combinatorial relationship between, and marginal impact of,
additional interventions to reduce HAIs; and (3) to build a framework for other hospitals and
healthcare systems to examine the effectiveness of interventions parameterized by their own
institution's data. Models will start with the patient at the center, utilizing the rich covariate data
stored in electronic health records to develop prediction models based on advanced machine
learning. These prediction models will be translatable tools that can be directly incorporated
into clinical care to assist clinicians in preventing HAIs. Data on patient-connectedness will
form the foundation of hospital-level models that will allow for detailed examinations of the
effectiveness of different combinations of interventions. Finally, a generalizable framework will
be constructed and tested across a network of healthcare facilities. These models will directly
inform CDC guidelines about MDRO prevention and aid clinicians in reducing the risk of HAIs."
11032425,"Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is an ongoing global health crisis. The WHO
reports 10 million active cases and over 1.5 million deaths annually. RNA polymerase (RNAP), the enzyme
responsible for all transcription in bacteria, is the target for rifampicin, a first-line treatment for TB. RNAP is thus
a proven and attractive target for developing new drugs. These facts highlight the importance of our recent
structural and functional characterization of Mtb RNAP, and the essential transcription factors required for full
transcriptional activity and intrinsic antibiotic resistance. In addition, we have found that studying diverse clades
of bacteria deepens our understanding of general principles of transcription. Therefore, we study Actinobacteria,
as the biophysical and molecular mechanisms of transcription in this clade are relatively understudied and
because it includes important pathogens.
We determined high-resolution cryo-EM structures of several Mtb initiation transcription complexes with essential
transcription factors and important antibiotics in the previous funding period. Here my vision is to complete the
characterization of initiation regulation and expand our focus to the post-initiation steps throughout the
transcription cycle. These steps include elongation, pausing (a regulatory step where the RNAP temporarily halts
at specific sequences, permitting input from diverse signals), and termination. We will also continue
characterizing new RNAP inhibitors.
To complete our understanding of initiation, we will continue our studies of the WhiB factors, focusing on the
essential factor WhiB1, which is required for Mtb viability and response to stress. To characterize post-initiation
steps, we plan to study the mechanisms of mycobacterial NusA and NusG. NusG in Mycobacteria increases
transcriptional pausing and termination, yet it suppresses both in the well-characterized E. coli. This difference
in activity emphasizes the need to study these factors in other clades of bacteria. Most of these studies will
involve single-particle cryo-EM, but we plan to extend our studies in situ by using cryo-electron tomography to
investigate cellular processes and organizations, such as ribosomal coupling to RNAP. To rigorously study how
transcription factors act genome-wide, we will finish developing cell-free genomics: using genomic DNA as a
substrate for purified RNAP and transcription factors, and quantifying resultant transcripts with RNA-seq. This
method is necessary to identify native DNA sequences regulated by essential factors WhiB1, NusA, and NusG,
whose regulons have remained elusive due to pleiotropy upon perturbation in cells.
In sum, I envision using a multidisciplinary approach that includes structural, genetic, biochemical, genomic, and
in situ experiments to understand the roles and mechanisms of each step in the transcription cycle and how they
are regulated by cis and trans-acting elements. The results from this proposal have the potential to elucidate the
molecular and biological mechanisms of the entire transcription cycle."

Progress in modern bio-molecular sciences, from structural biology to structure-based drug design, is greatly
accelerated by methods of atomic-level modeling and simulations that bridge the gap between theory and
experiment. The so-called implicit solvation model can provide critical advantages of speed and versatility
through representing the effects of solvent – often the most computationally expensive part of such simulations
– in an approximate manner. The resulting speed-up of modeling efforts is critical in many areas such as
protein folding or protein-ligand docking. However, the accuracy of these fast models does not reach the
standard of the more traditional, but computationally very demanding explicit solvent approach. In particular,
even sophisticated implicit solvation models are unable to emulate explicit solvation effects with chemical
accuracy (errors less than 1 kcal/mol), simultaneously for small drug-like molecules and amino-acids – the two
key building blocks of every bio-medically relevant atomistic simulation. In general, chemical accuracy is a
prerequisite for quantitative in-silico drug design. As a result, reliability of the practical, fast implicit solvation
models remains low for many bio-medically relevant problems such as protein-ligand binding. Here, the
accuracy limitation will be addressed in a novel, systematic way; advantages of the new implicit solvation
models will be demonstrated within the context of bio-medically relevant applications.
This supplemental funding will allow us to explore, test, and fine-tune the new methodology in the context of
protein-drug binding directly relevant to fast-track development of novel therapeutics for the on-going COVID
disease and future pandemics."

Network (Vet-LRN) Cooperative Agreement Program is to increase sample analysis
capabilities for the FDA by collaborating with Vet-LRN laboratories in response to animal
food or drug-related illnesses, as well as other significant animal food/feed emergencies
necessitating increased testing capacity for implicated diagnostic or animal food samples.
This testing will encompass microbiological analysis of samples such as animal food, feed
and drugs, as well as associated environmental samples, and animal diagnostic necropsy
or clinical samples. The Auburn University CVM Diagnostic Laboratory will conduct
selected analyses of diagnostic samples provided by the FDA or other government
agencies in the event of large-scale microbiological contamination affecting animal food
or products. Furthermore, federal or state surveillance assignments will likely serve as
additional sources of samples for analysis. The overarching objective of the cooperative

laboratory testing capabilities. The program will facilitate the implementation of
standardized analyses through the utilization of standardized methods, equipment,
analytical worksheets, and electronic reporting. Each of the methods will be supported
with training and proficiency testing, while the quality management systems will be
bolstered. Additionally, small-scale method development and method validation projects
will be undertaken as directed by the Vet-LRN Program Office. The requested funding will

11036067,"This Maximizing Investigators Research Award (MIRA) application is proposed to support research in
the Beal lab at UC Davis focused on defining and controlling protein-RNA interactions in RNA editing
and RNA interference pathways. The RNA editing ADAR enzymes convert adenosines (A) to inosines
(I) in duplex RNA. Since I can behave similarly to guanosine (G) in RNA, this modification can have
profound effects on the structure and function of the modified RNA including, but not limited to,
changes in the meaning of specific codons (recoding). Mutations in the human ADAR1 gene cause
the skin disorder Dyschromatosis Symmetrica Hereditaria (DSH) and the autoimmune disease Aicardi-
Goutieres Syndrome (AGS). Also, ADAR1 upregulation and hyper editing has been observed in
several different cancers. Despite the significance of this form of regulation of RNA structure and
function, there remain key gaps in our understanding of A to I RNA editing. In addition, given ADARs’
ability to change RNA sequence, there is growing interest in harnessing this property and directing it
to correct disease-associated G-to-A mutations. Key questions in this field that will be addressed in
this project are: 1) What are the structures of key protein-RNA complexes in editing pathways?
Structures of full length human ADAR2 bound to different RNA substrates along with structures of
ADAR1 bound to RNA are necessary for a full understanding of substrate recognition and selectivity
in RNA editing. 2) Can we develop potent, selective and low MW ADAR inhibitors? Such inhibitors
could serve as lead compounds in the development of ADAR1-targeted cancer therapies. 3) Can we
develop new strategies to evolve mutant editing enzymes and novel substrate RNAs? The
results of these efforts will inform the design of highly efficient and selective reagents for directed RNA
editing applications.
 Our laboratory also has a long standing interest in the development of chemical modifications of
RNA that can control the interaction with RNA-binding proteins. Much of our recent work in this area
has focused on controlling the interaction of RNA with components of siRNA-triggered or miRNA-
triggered gene silencing pathways. The use of the RNAi pathway to study gene function has become
a powerful tool in molecular biology and has been exploited in the development of new therapeutics.
However, specific issues exist that limit its application. These issues include off-target effects that
arise from the ability of an siRNA guide strand to function as a miRNA. In addition, antisense
oligonucleotides targeting miRNAs (anti-miRs) have significant therapeutic potential and require
chemical modification for stability and efficacy. Up to this point, the development of new chemical
modifications of therapeutic RNAs has been largely an ad hoc process. The key question addressed
in this aspect of the proposed project is: Can we develop an effective systematic approach to new
RNA modifications that modulate protein-RNA interactions in interference pathways? The
immediate impact of these studies will be to provide new modifications to siRNAs and anti-miRs that
improve potency and selectivity. However, our continued refinement of an approach that uses
computational screening coupled with versatile RNA modification chemistry will be generally
applicable other projects that involve chemically modified RNA for therapeutics."

Examining the mechanistic interactions between K channels’ dysfunction in rNLS8 mice. Clinical
Relevance: Current amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) treatments only produce modest
increases in lifespan and little-to-no symptom relief. As motoneuron (MN) excitability dysfunction
is an early and persistent feature of ALS, it is believed to contribute to MN degeneration. Pilot
data from the parent grant indicates key roles for Kv2.1 and SK channels in MN excitability
dysfunction. Both channels are colocalized, are commonly activated by Ca, receive common input
from C-boutons, and, importantly, mediate K ion currents. These traits, and our pilot data, suggest
a functional interaction between SK and Kv2.1 channels. The objective of this research is to
identify and characterize previously unknown interactions between Kv2.1 and SK channels. We
will study these in both normal and dysfunctional conditions, using the rNLS8 mouse model of
ALS. Rationale: These channels both regulate excitability and are altered in ALS, and are thus
likely involved in dysregulation of excitability in ALS. SK and Kv2.1 have been studied separately,
and few studies examine Kv2.1 in the spinal cord. Given their roles in excitability regulation, it is
critical that we characterize these overlooked channel interactions and their roles in ALS,
which will expand the parent grant’s results. Thus, our Supplement Specific Aims are to test the
interdependence of these K channels’ activation in healthy vs rNLS8 MNs. Functional
dependencies of either channel on the other in health would represent novel mechanistic
knowledge. Moreover, a change in these interactions within the disease model would also
represent novel mechanisms which would become novel candidates for therapeutic targets.
Completion of these studies will elucidate the mechanisms of Kv2.1 and SK dysfunctions in ALS."
11036994,"mRNA ASSEMBLY IN DROSOPHILA GERM GRANULES
Development of every species relies critically on spatially organized messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Indeed, even a
single asymmetrically distributed mRNA can specify the morphology of cells, the body plan of a developing
organism and cell lineages across metazoans. RNA binding proteins (RBPs) typically organize mRNAs and
recruit them to subcellular structures. However, mRNAs can also self-organize into multi-mRNA assemblies
independently of other cellular components. mRNA assemblies are found in healthy cells in different species
and are often associated with RNA granules, membraneless ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particles that regulate
translation and stability of mRNAs. mRNA assemblies are also a hallmark of pathogenesis in human repeat
expansion disorders such as myotonic dystrophy 1 (MD1), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and
spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA). These findings indicate that mRNA assembly is an inherent property of an mRNA
that could be biologically relevant. However, the exact mechanism and potential biological functions of mRNA
assembly is unclear. mRNAs have been shown to self-assemble by phase separation, a process akin to oil-and-
water de-mixing. Here, RNA:RNA interactions, which promote intermolecular (trans) base-pairing and
secondary (cis) RNA structures have been implicated in driving mRNA assembly. In addition, in vitro data
suggest that RNA helicases, which are core constituents of RNA granules are thought to dissolve RNA:RNA
interactions in granules. In light of these findings, several critical questions arise. How do mRNAs self-
assemble in granules designed to prevent RNA:RNA interactions? What is the role of mRNA assemblies in
RNA granules? And what is the role of trans and cis RNA:RNA interactions and RNA helicases in the formation
and function of mRNA assemblies and RNA granules? mRNA assemblies tend to form as small clusters that are
acutely sensitive to the concentration and the environment in which they form. Thus, the central challenge
in studying mRNA assembly is that methods must be employed that enable examination of this process in
vivo and with high resolution and sensitivity. To achieve this, my lab will use genetic and quantitative,
super-resolution imaging approaches to analyze mRNA assembly in intact cells and within their
natural cellular context. Our goal is to understand how organisms form and harness mRNA assemblies to
promote development and to uncover new insight into how misregulation of mRNA assembly could contribute
to human diseases, such as MD1, ALS and SCA."

 Cilia sparked phenomenal interest as scientists recognized them as a fundamental cellular organelle
required for signaling. Untangling the specific mechanisms that regulate Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling within
the cilium is difficult since so many mutants that disrupt ciliogenesis also affect Hh signaling. We have long
focused on a small ciliary GTPase, ARL13B, that we hypothesize integrates the regulation of ciliogenesis and
Hh signaling through distinct effectors and their downstream pathways. As a GTPase, single basepair
mutations within the GTPase domain of ARL13B are predicted to disrupt individual effector pathways. ARL13B
is highly enriched in cilia. By engineering mouse expressing only an ARL13B variant that does not localize to
cilia, we genetically uncoupled the role of ARL13B in ciliogenesis from its role in signaling. We focus on
mammalian neural development and through forward genetic screens identified mouse mutants in several
proteins related to ARL13B. Additionally, other proteins in the ARL family of GTPases are implicated in cilia
and signaling through what appear to be ARL13B related mechanisms. In the next five years, we propose
using mouse mutants to define the regulatory relationships among these players in vivo and in specific cell
types. These experiments will unravel ARL13B function in ciliogenesis, traffic of proteins to/within cilia, and
Shh signal transduction at unprecedented resolution. Thus, our proposal will generate a molecular genetic
toolkit from which the field will be poised to distinguish the regulation of cilia from that of Hh signaling. This is
important to our fundamental understanding of cilia, ciliogenesis and cilia structure, as well as our basic
comprehension of the Hh pathway."

 Circadian rhythms are highly conserved, 24-hour, oscillations that tune human physiology to the
day/night cycle, enhancing fitness by ensuring that appropriate activities occur at biologically advantageous
times. Disruption of proper circadian synchronization negatively impacts the human long-term medical outlook,
making revealing the mechanism underlying circadian regulation over cellular physiology critical to human
health. Circadian rhythms are timed via a transcription-translation based negative feedback loop (TTFL), or
clock. The current paradigm for circadian regulation over physiology, termed the clocks “output”, is that
transcriptional programing generated by the TTFL drives temporally specific waves of gene expression.
However, our research has revealed that transcriptional programing cannot wholly account for clock output, as
we discovered little to no correlation between mRNAs and proteins that oscillate with a circadian periodicity in
fungi and macrophages, revealing robust circadian post-transcriptional control over immunometabolism. While
the mechanisms that time this circadian post-transcriptional control are unknown, we have demonstrated the
proteins involved in the transcriptionally repressive arm of the clock act as hub proteins for the formation of
large macromolecular complexes. Many of the proteins bound to these complexes are circadianly controlled at
the post-transcriptional level. Moreover, we established the clock repressive arm proteins have conserved
regions of intrinsic protein disorder that correlate with the predicted binding sights of the identified interactors.
 Our research goal is to validate the hypothesis that circadian post-transcriptional regulation is tuned via
the formation of time-of-day defined macromolecular protein complexes centered around the repressive arm
proteins. We posit that the formation of these complexes is enabled by conserved intrinsic disorder in the
repressive arm proteins, allowing flexibility to widely impart circadian post-transcriptional regulation over
immunometabolism. To test our hypothesis, we will create a Conformational/Temporal Interactome (CiTI) map
of clock repressive complex proteins in mammals and fungi. We will generate these CiTI maps in a sex and
immune-specific manner to define the effect of post-transcriptional circadian control over physiology. As a
mechanism for keeping time, circadian feedback loops are highly conserved and much of the definition of clock
mechanisms comes from the investigation of model systems. We will therefore exploit cost-effective fungal and
mammalian model systems to address our hypotheses. This supplement will support the purchase of a widefield
microscope, which will help to address all of the proposed hypotheses above, furthering our long-term goal of
elucidating the fundamental principles of circadian timing, revealing the mechanisms of circadian control over
cellular physiology."

Mathematical analysis, computational statistics, and machine learning are increasingly being deployed to
understand and predict the dynamics of healthcare associated infections (HAI) and antimicrobial-resistant
infections (ARI). However, the utility of these models to guiding clinical and health policy decisions often
remains unclear. One challenge is that model calibration quickly becomes obsolete as the epidemiology of HAI
and ARI changes. To address this gap, we propose to use mathematical modeling and machine learning
approaches to build decision-making technologies that improve the risk assessment, prevention, and
control of HAI and ARI. Our proposed technologies account for spatial and temporal dynamics, provide
continuous, real-time feedback to clinicians and are robust to changes in risk factors and disease prevalence
over time. We anticipate that implementation of these technological improvements will help healthcare
institutions to substantially reduce the burden of HAI and ARI. We concentrate our efforts on two of the most
important HAI: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridioides difficile infections. To conduct
these studies, we assembled a team of mathematical modelers, machine learning specialists, health
economists, clinical informaticists, infectious disease physicians, and hospital epidemiologists based in
California, New York, and Texas. Clinical, microbiological and environmental data to train our models will come
from three academic quaternary medical centers and an expanding network of community hospitals. The first
aim is to calculate the patient-specific risk of acquiring or transmitting a HAI or ARI. We hypothesize
that the risk of acquiring an HAI or ARI is more accurately determined when data on patient movement and
pathogen exposure are integrated into predictive models. This type of analysis is also expected to improve the
risk assessment of automated systems used to detect HAI and ARI outbreaks. The second aim is to prevent
invasive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. One objective is to show that
cost-effective reduction of invasive MRSA infections and hospital-based transmission can be achieved via
personalized decisions for who should be screened for asymptomatic carriage and decolonized. Our third aim
is to control the spread of Clostridioides difficile infections (CDI). We hypothesize that by calculating the
number of CDI averted and the cost saved, models of disease transmission will demonstrate the benefit pre-
emptive adoption of contact precautions for patients who are at high risk of transmitting CDI. We also expect to
identify environmental pathways that contribute to the risk of CDI superspreading and would benefit from
enhanced surveillance and decontamination. Finally, to better understand the importance of antibiotic
stewardship programs, we characterize the specific role a patient's antibiotic, infection, social, exposure and
colonization history plays in the personal risk of acquiring an invasive MRSA infection and CDI."

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the
US (2023) with the 5-year survival rate standing only at less than 9%. Three major issues in pancreatic
tumor treatment are; poor availability of anticancer molecules due to limited blood supply to pancreas,
development of resistance to first line agents e.g. gemcitabine and extensive fibrosis in tumor stroma.
There is an urgent need for a novel and effective therapeutic strategy for PDAC via simultaneously
targeting tumor and its microenvironment. Given the central role of Myc as a mediator of multiple cell
proliferation and survival pathways, it is very essential to target the proto-oncogenic expression of Myc
and controlling K-Ras mediated drug resistance in pancreatic cancer. BRD4 Proteolysis Targeting
Chimera (PROTAC) is an effective way to silence BRD4 and Myc. On another side, collagen type I
dense extracellular matrix of solid tumor severely restricts the uptake of drug, monoclonal antibodies
and nanotherapeutics within pancreatic tumor. Overexpressed focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in
pancreatic cancer plays role in angiogenesis, fibrosis and metastasis. Secreted protein acidic and rich
in cysteine (SPARC) and KRAS mutation collectively facilitate the uptake of albumin into stroma and
PDAC cell, respectively. Based on our promising preliminary results, the parent NIH R16 award was
proposed to explore the albuminosomes for pancreatic tumor specific delivery of BRD4 PROTAC with
simultaneous compromising the fibrotic stoma using FAK inhibitor-PND 1186. The requested grant
supplemental equipment – ECHO Revolution hybrid fluorescence microscope will be of great help in
investigating the cellular uptake mechanism of albuminosomes in 2D and 3D cell culture of pancreatic
cells. The uptake of nanoparticles in tumor stroma and cancer cells is essential for enhancing its
anticancer efficacy. High resolution microscope with automated scanning capability will be useful in (a)
identifying and locating the nanoparticles within PDAC stroma and KRAS mutant PDAC cancer cells
(b) Penetration and anticancer efficacy evaluation using multicellular 3D spheroids of PDAC cell and
cancer associate fibroblasts. The microscope will be housed in the PI’s laboratory. Undergraduate and

Microtubules (MTs) and the structures they form play essential roles in eukaryotic cells. Best known as dynamic
polymers assembled from a/b-tubulin heterodimers, MTs are absolutely required in numerous cellular processes,
including mitosis. Many of these activities depend on dynamic MT behavior, but there are critical cellular functions
that require stable microtubules. Stable singlet MTs in neurons act as tracks for axonal transport, stable doublet
MTs in axonemes generate force in cilia, and stable triplet MTs are found in centrioles and basal bodies that
organize centrosomes and cilia, respectively. Despite their importance, we know little of how stable MT-based
structures are assembled, maintained, and disassembled. Because the same tubulin dimers assemble dynamic
and stable MTs in most organisms, including the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila, the different MT behaviors
are attributed to associated proteins and protein modifications. In doublet and triplet MTs, some associated
proteins are found inside the hollow MT; these microtubule inner proteins (MIPs) are the focus of our work.
Originally discovered using various forms of electron microscopy, MIPs appeared as structures of unknown
composition inside axonemal doublet microtubules. MIPs are proposed to mitigate the deformation and stress
on doublet MTs caused by ciliary beating. Ciliary beating moves extracellular fluid in a single direction, which is
necessary for many essential processes, such as clearing mucus from airways, facilitating the movement of eggs
in the fallopian tube, and generating cerebrospinal fluid flow in the brain. Structurally analogous to the motile
cilium, the flagellum is required for sperm motility. Defects disrupting motile cilia cause a wide range of human
pathologies, including primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), hydrocephalus, and infertility in both sexes.
Understanding of how ciliary defects lead to motility problems and disease is limited. Previously, we identified
Rib72A and Rib72B in Tetrahymena cilia as MIPs required for normal cilia beating. Comparative proteomic
analyses of axonemes isolated from wild type and rib72A-, rib72B- null cells identified additional MIPs, such as
Fap115 and Calciphosin-like protein, whose assembly is defective in the mutants. We further characterized
Fap115 and showed it to be essential for normal cell motility and axoneme stability. Meanwhile, by comparing
the doublet MT structures of Tetrahymena, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, and Bos taurus, we find both
conservation and diversity of MIPs in these evolutionarily distant organisms, revealing essential and divergent
functions. The long-term goal of this project is to use biophysical, genetic, and advanced microscopy tools to
better understand the function and assembly mechanisms of motile cilia. To do this, we plan to identify
Tetrahymena MIPs in both axonemal doublet and basal body triplet MTs, to map protein interactions that drive
MIP localization and assembly, and to illuminate how MIPs contribute to basal body and cilia function. Our
proposed work will significantly advance our understanding of the mechanisms of cilia assembly and function
and will help reveal how dysfunction in these processes contributes to human ciliopathies."

Synapses are fundamental units of communication in the nervous system, where immense
diversity in structure and function serve to tune and calibrate information transfer. Defects in the
ability of synapses to properly diversify contribute to the etiology of a variety of
neurodevelopmental, psychiatric, and neurodegenerative diseases. One means of generating
diversity in synaptic function is through molecular heterogeneity, where combinations of distinct
genes are expressed at individual synapses to enable specific functional properties. However, it
has become increasingly clear, though difficult to resolve, that remarkable synaptic diversity can
be achieved from a limited set of molecular machinery. In principle, the Drosophila neuromuscular
junction (NMJ) is a uniquely powerful model to address how synaptic diversity is generated given
the sophisticated genetic, electrophysiological, and imaging approaches. In this system, two
distinct motor neurons converge to co-innervate individual muscle targets, where transmission
from a strong and weak input together drive muscle contraction in the motor circuit. However, an
inability to selectively isolate transmission from either input has been a major limitation towards
understanding synaptic diversity in this system. Here, we propose to use expression of a unique
Botulinum NeuroToxin (BoNT) to selectively silence transmission at strong or weak synaptic
inputs. Preliminary data suggests that while each neuron is largely composed of the same
molecular machinery at active zones, one core component, previously thought to function
universally at all active zones, actually subserves dramatically different roles at strong vs weak
synapses. We will use BoNT silencing, super resolution imaging, and the latest calcium reporters
targeted to release sites to illuminate differences in active zone nanostructure and function
between strong and weak synapses. We will also leverage new innovations in CRISPR
mutagenesis to dissect the specialized functions of eight core active zone components at strong
vs weak synapses. Finally, we will interrogate how these core active zone components are
uniquely targeted for modulation and remodeling at strong vs weak synapses in the context of
homeostatic synaptic plasticity. Together, these approaches will unlock fundamental insights into
how glutamatergic synaptic diversity is established and adaptively modified through plasticity.
Ultimately, this understanding will illuminate key mechanisms through which heterogeneous
functional properties at glutamatergic release sites are enabled by a limited molecular toolkit."

The goal of this project is to demonstrate a bench-top system that can interface with individual axons in the
cervical vagus nerve through an implanted, all-optical instrument. Addressing individual axons requires
single-micron spatial resolution at a depth of several mm. Recording and modulation are achieved through
multiphoton absorption of incident infrared light and detection of fluorescence in the visible spectrum. The
optical system must be precisely focused on individual axons. The instrument will incorporate an adaptive
electrowetting device for both scanning laterally and axially to enable compact, lightweight, and non-
mechanical implementation. To enable time-lapse measurements, it is important to characterize the adaptive
optical devices for environmental resilience in terms of temperature, power handling, and vibration.
The proposed bio-imaging technology will enable improvements to the performance of existing glass micro-
endoscopes for deep, broad-bandwidth, high-resolution neuromodulation. Thus, this supplement will address
the environmental testing and qualification of these adaptive optical devices. It is hypothesized that thermal
management of the devices will enable optical powers up to 0.5 W, with operation over several months, while
demonstrating resilience to external vibrations up to several hundred Hz.
Here we request funds for 1.5 years of graduate training for Mr. Darwin Quiroz, who is pursuing his doctorate
in Physics at the University of Colorado Boulder. Mr. Quiroz has a strong background in optics and materials
and is keenly interested in optical devices for biomedicine. This work will provide him with broad training in
optical imaging, neuroscience, biomaterials, and independent research. A comprehensive mentoring plan
will provide professional development and training to launch his career as an independent researcher."
11035433,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Iatrogenic nerve injury represents one of the most feared surgical complications. Nerves are critically important
to the function of most tissues and nerve injury can lead to permanent disability. Surgery is performed commonly
in the U.S. with approximately 40 million operations annually, incurring up to 600,000 iatrogenic nerve injuries.
Essential nerves may be injured across surgical specialties including general, thoracic, cardiac, urologic, plastic,
colorectal, spinal, neuro-, otolaryngologic and orthopaedic surgery. Surprisingly, no clinically approved technol-
ogy can directly enhance intraoperative nerve visualization, which is typically performed through neuroanatomi-
cal knowledge, conventional white light imaging and electrophysiologic monitoring. This work will directly address
this unmet clinical need. Fluorescence guided surgery (FGS) is a form of surgical guidance that seeks to improve
the safety and efficacy of surgery through machine-assisted visual identification of critical tissues that require
removal (e.g., tumors) or structures that must be preserved to maintain post-operative function (e.g., nerves).
Clinical open and laparoscopic FGS vision systems operate nearly exclusively in the near infrared (NIR, 650-
900 nm). To employ FGS, clinicians typically administer a fluorescent contrast agent intravenously (IV) prior to
surgery that accumulates or marks tissues of interest (e.g., blood vessels, tumors, etc.) and deploy intraoperative
FGS vision systems capable of imaging the contrast agent distribution in the surgical field in real time. While
novel contrast agents for surgery are under development with the first molecularly targeted agent (i.e., pafola-
cianine) reaching recent FDA approval, clinical adoption and routine use for surgery remain an open question.
Part of this challenge stems from the integration of administration of the contrast agent into the existing clinical
workflow. Most of the developed targeted contrast agents require IV administration, presenting specific chal-
lenges to integration into the existing surgical workflow. IV administration of probes requires either a special trip
and appointment to the hospital or surgical center or a substantially earlier start time to accommodate the phar-
macokinetic (PK) profile of the probe. For patients that live in a rural setting, requiring long distance travel to their
surgical center or critically ill patients, this creates hardships and further challenges to availability of care. For
surgical centers and hospitals that are already straining to keep up with the workload, the IV contrast administra-
tion requires additional time and costs to integrate FGS into the clinical workflow. To alleviate these challenges,
we will explore additional routes for nerve contrast agent administration, including orally and subcutaneously
using agents with long pharmacokinetic profiles. Our overall vision for this technological advance is that nerve-
specific contrast could be administered at home, decreasing the burden on patients and the health care system
while still permitting identification and visualization of nerve-specific contrast during surgery."
11035780,"Pendrin (SLC26A4) is expressed in epithelial tissues, e.g., in the inner ear, thyroid, kidney, and lung where it
plays a central role in ion homeostasis and the regulation of the cell volume. Mutations in the Slc26a4 gene
cause Pendred Syndrome and enlarged vestibular aqueduct syndrome (EVAS), both of which are genetic
disorders characterized by childhood early hearing loss in children and account for 5-10% of hereditary hearing
loss and are currently not curable. Previous studies illuminated the role of pendrin in the physiology of the
cochlea, thyroid gland, kidney and proposed that it can transport iodide ions (I-), bicarbonate ions (HCO3-),
chloride ions (Cl-), and hydroxide ions (OH-) across epithelial cell membranes according to an electroneutral
exchange (antiport) reaction. However, our understanding of pendrin remains rudimentary due to a lack of
purified protein that enables precise functional studies without the potential interference of native proteins replete
in cellular/native systems and structural studies. To overcome this gap in our understanding, we have
successfully expressed and purified a mammalian homolog of human pendrin and developed binding and
transport assays to determine substrate selectivity and transport. Preliminary studies confirmed that purified
pendrin reconstituted in lipid membranes transports I- or HCO3- in exchange with Cl- or OH- and revealed that
the transport process is electrogenic, i.e., the stoichiometry of ion exchange is not 1:1 as previously postulated
for electroneutral antiport. We determined I-- and HCO3--bound pendrin structures by cryo-electron microscopy,
and our preliminary analysis suggests that pendrin has two anion binding sites, which may provide an explanation
for the electrogenic transport process. The structure reveals novel interactions between the transmembrane
domain (TMD) and the cytosolic domain, i.e., the sulphate transporter and anti-sigma factor antagonist domain
(STAS) that appears to be relevant for the transport mechanism because mutations at the interface of STAS and
TMD are known to cause Pendred Syndrome. Pendrin is also a promising drug target for attenuating airway
hyperresponsiveness in asthma and for reducing hypertension, and many pendrin inhibitors, e.g., the non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drug niflumic acid, has been reported to target pendrin, but the mechanisms of
inhibition remain unknown. Whereas these inhibitors could be repurposed to target pendrin, their action on
pendrin may also cause undesired side-effects, thus highlighting the need to elucidate the mechanisms of
pendrin inhibition by small molecules. We determined the structures of pendrin in complex with the anti-
inflammatory drugs YS-01 and niflumic acid, and our preliminary analysis shows that the two inhibitors occupy
different binding sites, providing motivation for the further determination of the mechanisms of inhibition. To this
end, the overall goal of this project is to understand the mechanism and pharmacology of pendrin at the atomic
level to aid in the development of efficacious drugs that specifically target pendrin in improved therapies against
Pendred Syndrome and EVAS."
11035786,"Project Summary: Biological processes ranging from gene transcription to behavior oscillate and are
synchronized to the 24-hour day/night cycle. Mammalian circadian rhythms, orchestrated by the hypothalamic
suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) allow appropriately timed physiological and behavioral responses to daily
recurring external cues (i.e. sunrise or timed meal availability). The resulting synchrony of physiology to the
astronomical day maximizes metabolic efficiency and good health. However, many of the stresses of modern
society (i.e. artificial lighting and omnipresence of food) weaken and desynchronize circadian rhythms. This in
turn increases the prevalence of many pathologies including metabolic disorders and neurodegenerative
diseases. The aim of my laboratory is to determine how circadian rhythms are synchronized to external cues
(circadian entrainment) and how desynchronization impacts health. Although the neuronal pathways of light-
driven entrainment are well-established, how other external cues, such as food availability, social interactions or
exercise, influence the workings of the SCN remains unknown. In a recent breakthrough, we identified a neuronal
connection between midbrain dopaminergic neurons that are activated in response to salient events and SCN
neurons that express the dopamine receptor Drd1. We showed that this pathway accelerates photoentrainment
and drives palatable food consumption outside of mealtimes. In parallel, we identified a novel molecular player
that is necessary for anticipation-related activity to time-restricted food access. Here, we propose to leverage
our expertise in disentangling circadian entrainment neurocircuitry to delineate the mechanisms by which
rewarding cues modulate the SCN circadian clock. Furthermore, we will determine whether strengthening
circadian rhythmicity ameliorates symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases. Our first objective is to gain a
mechanistic understanding of how salient events impact SCN activity and circadian entrainment. We hypothesize
that activation of dopaminergic signaling decreases the amplitude of SCN oscillation and allows faster
photoentrainment. This novel insight will be useful to develop strategies to curb the negative impact of circadian
desynchrony. Our second goal is to identify the midbrain dopaminergic cell population that targets the SCN and
promotes palatable food consumption outside of meal times, leading to weight gain and metabolic disorder. We
predict that by mimicking dopaminergic signaling in the SCN, we will control food consumption. Delineating this
pathway will provide therapeutic targets against diet induced metabolic dysfunction and obesity. Our final
objective is to determine if high amplitude circadian rhythms, by daily consolidation of light and food access, is
sufficient to slow the progression of a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). If successful, entrainment
strategies will become potential treatments for AD patients and people with high-risk of developing AD. We
expect our work will provide a better understanding of the relationship between entrainment cues, physiology
and behavior while providing tangible strategies against the adverse consequences of circadian misalignment."

This Administrative Supplement is for the purchase of a CEM LibertyPrime2.0
microwave-assisted peptide synthesizer designed for Fmoc-based solid-phase
peptide synthesis. The LibertyPrime2.0 uses a single mode self-tuned microwave
reactor that drastically reduces amino acid coupling times while increasing coupling
yields. A fiber optic temperature probe and reaction vessel camera within the sealed
microwave cavity also ensure accurate temperature monitoring and complete waste
removal during coupling and deprotection cycles. The LibertyPrime2.0 can efficiently
synthesize long peptide fragments of up to 48 amino acids that are inaccessible by
manual peptide synthesis. It is critical for our proposed studies to investigate the
biophysical and biochemical effects of histone sumoylation and p53 methylation in
human chromatin. This supplement seeks to replace an existing Liberty Blue peptide
synthesizer that is no longer functional, which significantly limits our experimental
capabilities. Use of the proposed instrumental setup will enable the semisynthesis of
site-specifically modified histones and transcription factors, which will lead to the
identification of novel pathways underlying neoplasia. This will reveal new therapeutic
targets in a wide range of human cancers associated with the dysregulation of histone
and p53 modifications."
11033781,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Molecular motors are essential for cellular organization, and drive cell-type specific architectures. Motors
distribute organelles, mRNA, and other cellular components to the correct place, at the proper time, and
regulate multiple pathways including secretion, and intracellular traffic. Thus, the proper control of molecular
motors is essential for animal physiology.
 Myosin V motors (MyoV) are present in most eukaryotes and provide relatively long-range movement of
cargoes on actin cables. Humans express three MyoV. Mutations in each MyoV have been linked to serious
diseases. In many cases, the defects may be due to an inability of the MyoV to properly associate with cargo.
We uncovered some of the mechanisms required for cargo attachment and detachment from MyoV. However,
there are large gaps in knowledge of how cargo attachment and detachment from MyoV is controlled.
 In S. cerevisiae (hereafter referred to as yeast), long-range transport of many cargoes occurs solely on
actin via MyoV. This contrasts with most organisms, where transport initiates on microtubules via kinesins with
a subsequent handoff to MyoV. Thus, regulation of yeast MyoV, Myo2, is a simpler system.
 Strikingly, selected cargoes of yeast Myo2 have distinct trajectories. This led to our discovery that
disengagement of Myo2 from its cargoes is a key property of organelle transport. Importantly, due to their
sequence similarity, mechanisms discovered for yeast Myo2 have provided insights into human MyoV function.
 This proposal is focused on vacuole/lysosome inheritance which occurs via Myo2 and is controlled both
spatially and temporally. We identified the Vac17-Vac8 vacuole adaptors, yet how Myo2 interacts with Vac17-
Vac8 and the mechanisms(s) that regulate formation and disassociation of the complex are poorly understood.
Our recent inroads in biochemical and genetic analyses have led to the following two aims.
 1) Determine the organization of the Myo2-Vac17-Vac8 complex. This aim will use genetics, fluorescence
microscopy, biochemistry, structural approaches and AlphaFold multimer predictions to determine how Vac17
associates with Myo2 and with the scaffold protein Vac8. 2) Determine roles of Vps41 and the kinase Yck3 in
the regulated disassembly of the Myo2-Vac17-Vac8 complex. We discovered that Vps41 and Yck3 are critical
for disruption of the Myo2-Vac17-Vac8 complex, yet their roles in this pathway are distinct from their known
roles in vacuole fusion. To determine their Myo2-specific roles, we will identify additional proteins that act with
Vps41 and Yck3 in the context of the Myo2-Vac17-Vac8 complex. We will use pull-down approaches, high-
content microscopy screens and proximity labeling. Further analysis of the candidates will be pursued with
fluorescence microscopy. Given that little is known about how molecular motors attach or detach from cargoes,
the proposed studies will likely reveal new pathways that are crucial for cell function."
11033785,"Microbial communities are complex systems whose emergent metabolic properties play a key role in
determining human health. Metabolic processes enabled by host-associated microbiota play a defining role in
individual health outcomes, and the emergent metabolism of microbial consortia affect environmental
processes from eutrophication to climate change, impacting human health on a global scale. Therefore,
humanity would benefit from a quantitative understanding of the rules by which the genomic composition of a
microbial community, and the environment in which it resides, determines its emergent metabolism.
Discovering the principles by which environmental variation alters community structure and determines
metabolic function is a necessity if we are to manipulate or design communities to improve health outcomes.
However, this task is challenging for existing methods.
 In preliminary work, we establish a new quantitative framework for predicting the emergent metabolism
of a bacterial community from its genomic composition using denitrification as a model metabolic process.
Combining quantitative bacterial phenotyping, modeling, and a simple statistical approach we demonstrated a
method that quantitatively maps gene content to metabolite dynamics in microbial communities. This insight
provides a route to quantitatively connecting the genes present in a community to metabolite dynamics. The
next challenge is to use this insight to understand how community function and structure depend on the
environment.
 We propose to extend this success by understanding how environmental gradients, complexity, and
dynamics impact community structure and function. We accomplish this by developing denitrification as a
model metabolic process. The outcomes of the proposed work will be three-fold. First, microbiome studies
have documented ubiquitous associations between environmental conditions and community composition, but
we do not understand the ecological or physiological origins of these emergent patterns or their metabolic
consequences. Using denitrifying communities across a pH gradient I will show that such patterns emerge from
ecological interactions. I will show that these interactions arise generically from the presence of physiological
trade-offs on microbial traits, providing a generalizable route to understanding the functional impact of
environmental variation on communities. Second, our preliminary study connected genomes to community
metabolism for a simple metabolic pathway acting. I will extend this success to complex pathways and
environmental conditions by constructing a method for predicting carbon utilization by communities in complex
nutrient conditions directly from genomes. I will utilize a powerful blend of genome-scale metabolic modeling
and multi-view machine learning, with impacts from host physiology to climate change. Third, I will use
denitrifying communities to test the idea that, like cells and organisms, microbial communities exhibit predictive
behaviors in dynamic environments. I propose that communities assembled in environments with distinct
schedules of aerobic respiration and anaerobic respiration (denitrification) adapt to facilitate the prompt
utilization of electron acceptors. I will test the hypothesis that community-level learning emerges from
ecological interactions and distinct gene regulatory programs, providing a new conceptual lens through which
we can view community adaptation to dynamic environments."
11034421,"Living systems choreograph molecular events with precise control—place, time, kinetics, and intensity
—and record memories of those occurrences in synaptic networks, gene expression, epigenetic
marks, and myriad other circuits that govern the where&when of biologic responses. Visualizing this
choreography and tracing these histories are tasks that chemists and biologists can accomplish with
only partial accuracy, considerable eﬀort, and limited temporal range. Our research agendas are thus
focused on constructing new chemical tools for temporospatial analysis of living systems, and
organized around the emergent properties that result from deploying next-level bioorthogonal
chemistries within multi-layered (bio)molecular architectures. The resulting hybrid systems circumvent
perennial challenges, achieving: i) simultaneous speed/stability, for eﬃcient real-time molecular
machinery and longitudinal performance in vivo; ii) sensitivity for detection of rare/unique events; and
iii) speciﬁcity/multiplicity, for accurate detection and ﬁne-grained molecular encoding of (sub)cellular
histories across time.
Building on the momentum of ongoing mechanistic investigations and the success of our recent eﬀort
to achieve multiplexed imaging of living cells and tissues, our goals for the next ﬁve years extend
bioorthogonal chemistry in applications that exploit two/three dimensional topologies, rather than
singular ligation/cleavage events, and in architectures that leverage nucleic acid hybridization to
encode sequence recognition, accelerate reaction kinetics, and enable signal ampliﬁcation. In one set
of projects, we aim to create self-amplifying programmable bioorthogonal reactions, elaborate the
capabilities of this new toolkit, and apply them to transform our methods for visualizing living cells and
tissues. In another, we have envisioned sequence-generating architectures that convert biocompatible
chemical reactivity into ampliﬁable biological information, establishing the concepts of bioorthogonal
translation and sequegenicity. With scaﬀolds that readily integrate into the workﬂows of existing high-
performance nucleic acid biotechnologies, we anticipate broad applicability and rapid downstream
development of a new generation of tools for tracking (bio)molecules, individual cells, and populations."
11034433,"Project Summary/Abstract
Bacteria undergo dramatic cellular re-organizations in different environments. Understanding the non-genetic,
reversible plasticity of cellular organization is crucial to unraveling the whole-cell level algorithm of survival,
growth, adaptation, and infection of bacteria, with biomedical significance in combating pathogens that can
adapt to various niches and tolerate antibiotics in the human body. Cellular space is incredibly crowded with
biomolecules yet well-organized. However, we still lack a precise understanding of how cellular space is
organized to dictate cellular scale behaviors, physiology, and fitness. The long-term goal of my lab is to
delineate basic principles of how life at the cellular scale emerges from biomolecules and their interactions. In
the next five years, we will pursue this goal by gauging how key features of cellular organizations interconnect
with physiological states and fitness in bacterial cells, in model organisms such as E. coli, and human
pathogens such as P. aeruginosa.
The organization of the cell connects to its physiological state via a combination of physical, chemical, and
biological processes. We will try to disentangle this complexity by testing two fundamental hypotheses
suggested by our preliminary observations: (1) the membrane real-estate hypothesis – the cytoplasmic
membrane is so packed with proteins that the cell needs to fine-tune the density, composition, and
organization of the membrane proteins for optimizing cell fitness, and (2) the cellular surplus hypothesis – the
core biosynthetic machines have an excess amount that does not benefit steady-state growth, but rather is
beneficial for adaptation to a new environment. To better test these ideas, we will quantify and manipulate the
density, composition, and spatial organization of membrane proteins and the abundance of core biosynthetic
machines and examine their effects on physiological states such as growth, adaptation, and cell death. We will
use these results to test physical models that render possible optimality principles by collaborating with
theorists in membrane physics and operations physics. These tasks require expertise in both quantitative
experiments and modeling. Our lab’s experience in biophysics, bioengineering, and molecular biology will set
us in a unique position to perform the research and foster cross-field collaborations and interactions. We also
plan to publish and share new tools and datasets to be yielded throughout the research with the scientific
community, such as microfluidic devices, image analysis software, and databases of protein physical
properties. Whether these hypotheses will be verified, outcomes from these projects can help us bridge cellular
organization and physiology and understand better cellular adaptation, a branch of knowledge that can be
extended to studying other higher organisms."
11034437,"ABSTRACT
Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide that occurs due to the
detrimental effects of myocardial infarction (MI)/ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). Mechanisms of MI/IRI
are not completely clear, and hence, there are no effective therapeutic strategies; current therapeutic
approaches to mitigate heart damage mostly focus on restoring coronary perfusion but not limiting
reperfusion injury. Multiple forms of cell death occur at different stages of post-MI/IRI depending on the
severity of the disease. This project will elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of a recently discovered iron-
dependent programmed cell death, ferroptosis, in cardiac IRI. Ferroptosis arises via excessive oxygenation
of phospholipids (PLs) accompanied by the insufficient capacity of a selenoprotein glutathione peroxidase
4 (GPX4) to eliminate oxidized PLs, particularly, phosphatidylethanolamine (PEox) at the expense of
reduced glutathione (GSH). We have recently identified and quantified pro-ferroptotic PEox species in
response to RSL3 (GPX4 inhibitor, ferroptosis inducer) in cardiomyocytes by a state-of-art technique. In
addition, our preliminary studies revealed accumulation of ferroptotic PEox species in mitochondria
isolated from hearts exposed to global IRI as well as from cardiomyocytes challenged with RSL3. We
propose that mitochondria participate in MI/IRI-induced ferroptotic signaling through two major GSH-
dependent mechanisms: i) IR-induced mitochondrial ROS generation by ETC and TCA cycle deplete GSH,
and hence, inactivate the GSH/GPX4 system, and ii) glutamate deficiency due to inhibition of
glutaminolysis in mitochondria inhibits GSH synthesis as a result of low glutamate and cysteine levels.
Thus, this project will explore a novel paradigm by investigating the role of mitochondria in cardiac IRI
ferroptosis. Our central hypothesis is that mitochondria are engaged in ferroptosis induced by cardiac IRI
through diminishing GPX4 activity and inability to control the accumulation of pro-ferroptotic PEox species.
Also, we propose that major cell death mechanisms have different impacts during post-MI/IRI depending
on the severity and duration of post-MI/IRI. Hence, we will evaluate specific biomarkers to distinguish the
contributions of apoptosis, ferroptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis to post-MI/IRI. Two approaches will be
employed to mitigate cardiac IRI via i) specific suppression of mtROS production/GSH depletion, and ii)
replenishment of the GSH pool by a potent reductant lipoic/dihydrolipoic acid (LA/DHLA). Specific Aims of
the project will (i) determine comparative contributions of ferroptosis to cardiac dysfunction during IRI, (ii)
explore molecular mechanisms of mitochondria-mediated ferroptotic signaling in cardiac cells, and (iii)
examine the effectiveness of novel inhibitors of ferroptosis against cardiac IRI. The project will establish
the contribution of ferroptosis, in comparison with other major cell death mechanisms, to MI/IRI-induced
cardiac dysfunction, and discover new mitochondria-mediated mechanisms of ferroptotic signaling that will
lead to innovative therapeutic strategies for the treatment of cardiac IRI."

Dual neurotransmission has the potential to transform the way we consider neuronal signaling and the
transmission of information within circuits and networks. The importance of dual transmission is evident by
the large and increasing number of identified dual transmitting neurons in every system. However we still
have only limited insight into the regulation and functional effects of co-transmission. During our previous
funding period, we established: 1) the majority of octopamine (OA, the invertebrate analogue of
norepinephrine), neurons co-express glutamate, 2) OA and glutamate have overlapping, as well as distinct,
roles in reproductive and aggressive behaviors, and 3) manipulation of a glutamate-OA neuronal subset leads
to high intensity aggression. Although aggression is a critical component of social behavior observed across
species, when expressed at elevated levels aggression in humans can threaten lives and incur economic
burdens on society. Given the importance of maintaining a critical balance of aggression and
understanding the implications of dual transmission signaling in general, in this proposal we are
identifying the molecular and physiological mechanisms that constrain aggression as well as
dynamically regulate the release of co-transmitters. Leveraging our deep understanding of aggression-
promoting neurons, genetic tools, and functional imaging, we will test our hypothesis in three specific aims.
First, using fluorescent biosensors to visualize neurotransmitter release and Ca2+ imaging to quantify neuron
activity, we will test the hypothesis that glutamatergic and adrenergic receptors expressed by glutamate-OA
neurons are required for the regulation of co-transmission. Second, using epitope-tagged vesicular
transporters and antibodies we will test the hypothesis that sexually dimorphic glutamate-OA neurons exhibit
dynamic age-related changes in VGLUT levels. Finally, we will determine if VMAT-VGLUT terminal
phenotypes are dependent on external cues from postsynaptic neurons. The significance of our study is that
it addresses a fundamental neuroscience question, namely the molecular and potentially sexually dimorphic
regulation of the dual transmission phenomenon, as well as potentially leading to the targeting of the
glutamatergic system within glutamate-monoamine neurons as a therapeutic strategy for unchecked
aggression."

Black, Latino/a/e/x, and Multiracial (BLM) sexual and gender minorities who have sex with men (SGMSM) in
the U.S. continue to experience a high and disproportionate burden of HIV, particularly younger BLM SGMSM
for whom HIV incidence continues to rise despite advances in HIV prevention. Evidence suggests that
differences in individual risk behaviors do not account for HIV inequities, and underscore the need to move
beyond models of individual-level risk factors to identify and intervene upon the socio-structural factors that
create and maintain inequitable risk environments. However, much of the research to date is limited in scope
and focuses individual-level risk or on cross-sectional HIV prevalence, which limits the ability to treat socio-
structural factors as dynamic or to investigate the environments within which risk behaviors occur. We are
submitting this application in response to RFA-AI-21-018 Limited Interaction Targeted Epidemiology to
Advance HIV Prevention (UG3/UH3). We propose to enroll a cohort of approximately 5,500 BLM SGMSM ages
16 and older in the U.S. and Puerto Rico who are at high risk for HIV infection. We will use a combined
approach to recruitment (sexual networking apps, social media, and other digital recruitment techniques) that is
adaptive to known shifts in digital technology. Participants will complete a survey and home-based sampling for
lab-based HIV testing at enrollment and annually thereafter for three years and an ecological momentary
assessment (EMA) for six weeks after enrollment. Concordant with study enrollment, we will develop novel
metrics to quantify socio-structural factors (state-level policy and social climate indicators) that create
intersectional oppression for BLM SGMSM, specifically structural racism, anti-LGBTQ stigma, and restrictive
HIV-related healthcare (Aim 1a). We will subsequently utilize the newly developed metrics from Aim 1a along
with local socio-structural factors (local-level HIV prevalence and socioeconomic indicators) and baseline and
EMA data to test the inequitable risk environments hypothesis to understand the role of state and local socio-
structural risk factors in HIV risk—this hypothesis will specifically test both the impact of socio-structural factors
on daily exposure to intersectional stigma and the interaction of socio-structural risk with individual behaviors
on undiagnosed HIV infection at baseline (Aim 2). These data will also be used to test a longitudinal model of
mechanisms through which state and local socio-structural factors directly and indirectly influence HIV
seroconversion and access to emerging HIV prevention technologies (e.g., emerging PrEP modalities) (Aim 3).
Study findings will be systematically reviewed and translated into guidelines for Ending the HIV Epidemic-
related public health policy and community-level interventions to reduce HIV inequities (Aim 1b). Developing
and testing a socio-structural model of HIV risk has strong potential to move the field beyond individually-
focused models of risk and improve the next generation of HIV prevention interventions aimed at reducing
disparities for this population."

According to the American Society of Clinical Oncology, in the year 2020, stomach cancer caused death of
768,793 patients worldwide making it the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths. H. pylori infection is the
strongest risk factor for gastric cancer. H. pylori-initiated inflammation leads to atrophic gastritis, spasmolytic
polypeptide expressing metaplasia (SPEM), gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM) and dysplasia, a series of
preneoplastic lesions strongly associated with gastric cancer. The eradication of H. pylori by antibiotic treatment
has been effective in reducing the incidence of preneoplastic lesions and gastric cancer. However, following H.
pylori eradication already established mucosal metaplastic changes may not reverse, and the risk of gastric
cancer in such patients remains high. A better understanding of the mechanisms contributing to inflammation
and the resulting preneoplastic lesions is required to develop rational and effective therapies. One of the
mechanisms by which H. pylori stimulates inflammatory signaling and preneoplastic lesions is by disrupting the
communication between the gastric epithelium and the surrounding mesenchyme/stroma. We have identified a
novel role of PKA activation in the gastric mesenchyme in establishing a proinflammatory and preneoplastic state
that is associated with downregulation of BMP signaling which is known to be a key regulator of gastric
inflammation and preneoplasia. We generated and characterized a novel conditional mutant mouse Six2Cre+/--
PKAcRfl/wt (CA-PKA) model in which single allele-mediated expression of constitutively active PKA (PKAcR)
was induced in the stomach mesenchyme using Six2-Cre transgenic mice. CA-PKA Mice develop preneoplastic
lesions such as atrophic gastritis, SPEM, GIM and dysplasia along with marked chronic inflammation, factors
strongly associated with gastric cancer The central hypothesis of this proposal is that PKA activation in the gastric
mesenchyme is a key driver of gastric carcinogenesis by inciting inflammation and inhibiting BMP signaling that
will be tested in the following three aims. Aim 1 is to determine the mechanisms that contribute to inflammation
and oxyntic atrophy in CA-PKA mice. Aim 2 is to determine the effects of genetic modulation of BMP pathway
inhibitor gremlin 1 (Grem1) on the severity of gastric preneoplastic lesions in CA-PKA mice. Aim 3 is to determine
the impact of misregulated PKA signaling on H. felis-induced gastric pathology. Expected outcomes of the
proposed research will define the molecular and functional significance of mis-regulated PKA signaling in
disrupting gastric homeostasis and driving pathology. A better understanding of misregulated PKA signaling as
an underlying cause of gastric inflammation and preneoplasia can help develop preventative and treatment
strategies for gastric cancer and associated pathological conditions."
11032462,"Signaling by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) controls major vital processes in developing and adult eukaryotes
and is involved in a variety of human pathologies. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is the classic RTK,
whose signaling and trafficking have been extensively studied, but the molecular mechanisms of endocytosis
and spatiotemporal regulation of signaling processes by endocytosis remain poorly understood. Fundamental
questions of whether signaling is triggered from endosomes by internalized EGFR and how such signaling is
regulated by the endosomal sorting machinery are not addressed. Reciprocally, whether EGFR signaling
regulates endocytic trafficking machinery, remains sparsely studied and controversial. Further, the degree and
rates of the incorporation of EGFR signaling complexes into intralumenal vesicles of multivesicular endosomes,
a process that terminates signaling, are also unknown. In the NIGMS funded research, we have developed
single-cell and high-throughput methods to quantitatively monitor endocytic trafficking of endogenous gene-
edited EGFR using a pH-sensitive ratiometric fluorescence excitation model. We used these methods to
elucidate the mechanism of EGFR endocytosis caused by activation of stress-induced p38-MAP kinase and to
determine mechanisms of the crosstalk of this pathway with ligand-induced endocytic pathways. We have
developed a pipeline for generation of gene-edited cells expressing endogenous fluorescently tagged EGFR and
its downstream signaling effectors, and new approaches to examine the dynamics of these components at high
spatial and temporal resolution in living cells. We performed comprehensive phosphoproteomic and proximity
proteome mass-spectrometry screenings to identify signaling effectors and regulators of endosomal EGFR.
Finally, our preliminary experiments using a novel live-cell assay prompted us to hypothesize that EGFR:adaptor
complexes are rapidly incorporated into intralumenal vesicles of multivesicular endosomes which diminishes the
capacity of those complexes to signal. These advances have placed us in a unique position to fully define
molecular mechanisms of clathrin-mediated internalization of EGFR, an endocytic pathway of EGFR in vivo, and
address key fundamental questions of whether EGFR signals from endosomes and how this signaling is
terminated. We will exploit the discoveries of the endosomal localization of an actin regulator VAV2 and a protein
of uncertain function, TFG (Trk-gene fusion protein), to define their functions in EGFR signaling from endosomes.
Using our new assay measuring distribution of signaling complexes within multivesicular endosomes in living
cells, we will determine the dynamics of the termination of signaling from endosomal EGFR complexed with
various endogenous fluorescently labeled adaptors and enzymes. Together, proposed studies will lead to a
comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of endocytosis and spatiotemporal regulation of signaling
processes by endocytosis, and will serve as a paradigm to a similar analysis of the whole RTK family."
11035704,"Abstract:
 RNA sequences have pervasive roles in biology and RNA molecules are also important
pharmaceuticals. Many of these RNA molecules function by use of specific structures, and these
structures are therefore conserved across evolution. With the availability of high throughput
methods to identify RNA transcripts and probe structure, there is a need to model these structures
to get the most information from available data. The goal of the Mathews lab is to develop
algorithms and software to model RNA structures, including secondary and tertiary structures.
We focus on using biophysical principles, and we are also at the forefront of incorporating
additional information in our models, including experimental mapping data and structure
conservation. Here, we will build on the foundation of prior work to develop new structure
prediction methods. We provide our software freely to the community and we rigorously test our
methods with close collaborations with experimentalists."
11035734,"SUMMARY
The goal of our project is to understand the structural features guiding the initial stages of pre-mRNA splice site
recognition, which are critical for accurate pre-mRNA splicing and frequently dysregulated in human diseases.
We focus on the U2AF, SF1 and SF3B1 splicing factors directing the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U2
snRNP) to the 3´ splice sites of pre-mRNAs. The U2AF subunits, U2AF2 and U2AF1, recognize the
polypyrimidine and AG-dinucleotide splice site signals. A third subunit, SF1 initially associates with the branch
point sequence of the pre-mRNA then is displaced by the SF3B1 subunit of the U2 snRNP. Dynamic
phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of SF3B1 is required for formation of the active spliceosome. Previously,
we made progress towards understanding the molecular underpinnings of the initial steps of 3´ splice site
selection. Using X-ray crystallography, biophysical techniques, and functional assays for pre-mRNA splicing in
human cells, we have shown that representative cancer-associated mutations at the U2AF2 – RNA interface
disrupt RNA binding and splicing. We have deciphered structural details showing how U2AF2 accommodates
diverse nucleotides of splice site signals. By complementary single molecule Förster resonance energy transfer
approaches, we further revealed that the U2AF2 conformation changes in response to different splice site
sequences as well as the U2AF1 subunit and its recurrent cancer-associated mutation. We have established
important, functional interfaces of U2AF2 with SF1 and SF3B1 during pre-mRNA splicing in human cells and
discovered that phosphorylation strongly reduces SF3B1 binding to U2AF2. However, these provocative results
raise new questions. First, what are the effects of recurrent U2AF2 mutations in neurodevelopmental disorders
compared to those in cancers? Second, how is dynamic SF3B1 phosphorylation and dephosphorylation
temporally regulated with U2AF2 dissociation prior to splicing? Third, how are the U2AF2, U2AF1, and SF1
subunits arranged to accurately recognize the splice site signals and ensure the fidelity of splicing? We address
these questions in the aims of this proposal by leveraging structural approaches (including X-ray crystallography,
cryoelectron microscopy, calorimetry, and fluorescence) and complementary functional assays (including co-
immunoprecipitations, pre-mRNA splicing assays, and transcriptome-wide sequencing). Altogether, the results
of these aims contribute to understanding the structural and functional underpinnings of 3´ splice site recognition
and its dysregulation in human disease."

Chromosome abnormalities due to meiotic errors are a leading cause of birth defects and spontaneous
abortions in humans. Our overarching goal is to understand how the organization of chromosomes in the
nucleus contributes to the correct pairing, synapsis, and recombination of homologous chromosomes during
meiosis I prophase– and how infidelity in these processes lead to chromosomal abnormalities. The basic
mechanisms leading to homolog pairing, synapsis and recombination are well conserved. The study of a wide
range of organisms has ultimately led to insights into human gamete aneuploidy and infertility. We use two
model organisms, budding yeast and zebrafish, each providing a unique lens to address how the 3D
configuration of chromosomes is governed to accommodate the changes in the nuclear landscape throughout
meiotic prophase. Our work addresses three key questions in the field of chromosome biology: 1) How do
chromosomes balance the contributions of diffusive versus active motion, 2) How does movement promote
molecular transactions between chromosomes? And 3) how do cells sense and respond to unpaired meiotic
chromosomes to ensure reproductive fidelity? 1) To understand how chromosomes move, we will examine the
contributions of diffusion, constrained diffusion, and active motor-driven movement on chromosomal loci in
yeast by comparing data sets of XYZ coordinates of tagged loci over time using our newly developed imaging
pipeline. We will compare these outcomes with newly developed models of chromosome behavior based on
simple biophysical properties of polymers. We will test if the nuclear pore complex also contributes to
chromosome motion, building on our discovery of a role of the NPC in meiotic chromosome dynamics. 2) To
understand how the organization of chromosomes in the much larger vertebrate nucleus contributes to
effective homolog pairing we will build on our recent work in zebrafish showing the initial events of pairing and
synapsis all take place at the telomere bouquet, suggesting that pairing in the larger nucleus is accommodated
by temporally and spatially sequestering pairing factors in time and space. We will test if telomere attachment
or positioning at the nuclear membrane is important for pairing, and we will identify the epigenetic markers that
define pairing-competent features of chromosomes. 3) To understand how cells respond to unpaired
chromosomes and how does this response differ between species, and even between sexes of the same
species, we will take advantage of our recent findings that synaptic errors cause arrest in spermatogenesis in
zebrafish males. Furthermore, synaptic errors in females are tolerated, thus raising the tantalizing possibility
that the surveillance and silencing of asynapsed chromosomes checkpoints does not operate in zebrafish."

11035577,"Parent Abstract
The primary route of internalization from the plasma membrane is clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), which
is required for vital cellular processes such as signaling, nutrient uptake, and development. While the molecular
mechanisms underlying the late stages of vesicle formation are well studied, the mechanisms underpinning the
earliest stages of endocytosis, including initiation and cargo selection, are poorly understood. Initiation and cargo
binding are largely controlled by the AP2 clathrin adaptor complex, a core component of the vesicle coat that
serves as a bridge between the rigid clathrin lattice and membrane-embedded cargo. However, it is unclear how
AP2 discriminates between hundreds of potential cargo in a complex membrane environment, while also
responding to spatial and temporal regulatory cues. While >50 proteins are proposed to regulate or be required
for CME, and many physically interact with AP2, we have little mechanistic and structural data for how they are
regulated during the earliest stages of endocytosis. We propose that multiple unique AP2 conformations, driven
by association with regulatory factors, control higher-order AP2 functions such as cargo selection. Understanding
the nature of the regulatory mechanisms controlling endocytosis is critical, as CME largely controls the
localization of many medically-relevant proteins such as RTKs and GPCRs. This proposal therefore seeks to
reconstitute and define the molecular mechanisms of AP2-mediated endocytic initiation and cargo sorting.
Current models of endocytosis largely rely on biochemical experiments performed with soluble components and
live cell imaging. Importantly, our methodology is focused on modifying all experimental approaches — cryo-EM,
biochemical reconstitution, and single molecule fluorescence microscopy — to include a membrane, thereby
addressing a critical need to develop mechanistic models in a near-native membrane environment. This
approach is poised to provide an understanding of the role of membrane-induced allostery in driving regulatory
decision-making during endocytic initiation. This proposal will focus on two broad areas of endocytic regulation
— cargo selection mediated by the conserved Muniscin family proteins, and a quality control checkpoint
controlled by a single phosphorylation mark on the μ2 subunit of AP2. As diseases associated with endocytic
defects are likely caused by missorting of important trans-membrane cargo, our insights into the mechanisms of
endocytic initiation and cargo selection will enable hypothesis-driven research into disease model systems and
drug development."
11035592,"Humans inevitably age, and often develop cancer. A fundamental cause of aging and cancer is the loss of
genome stability (abnormalities in nuclear DNA or chromosomes). Hence, understanding mechanisms
regulating genome stability has huge impact on biology and human health. Hypothesis related to genomic
instability generation and cancer evolution has long been revolved around the DNA damage response and
repair programs that control DNA metabolism. Our recent findings indicate an important role of liquid phase
separation, an emerging biological process by which proteins and nucleic acids form membraneless liquid
droplets/condensates inside cells to respond to environmental and internal cues, in regulating genome stability.
We demonstrated that this activity preserves the structure and the function of heterochromatin through a
protein called 53BP1; importantly, this new protective activity of 53BP1 is independent of its widely known role
in DNA double strand break (DSB) repair (Nat Communications, 2022). Hence, our results open a new
research paradigm in studying genome stability regulation and stress response. The overarching goal of this
application is to establish this research paradigm by understanding the mechanism and the impact of 53BP1
liquid phase separation. Two Aims are proposed. Aim 1 will determine how exactly 53BP1 phase separates
at heterochromatin. Aim 2 will determine the biological significance of 53BP1 phase separation. By
assembling an interdisciplinary team consisting of experts on molecular and cellular biology, proteomics,
computational bioinformatics, and next generation sequencing, we will use a combination of cell biological,
molecular, biochemical, genetic, morphological, and chemical approaches to answer these questions. Upon
completion, our studies will illustrate a previously uncharacterized function of 53BP1 and a novel interplay
between 53BP1 and heterochromatin and determine their impact on genome stability, facilitating our

The negative impact of heavy episodic drinking (HED) among college students continues to be a major public
health issue, and students who are members of fraternities and sororities (Greek members) are at particularly
greater risk for experiencing negative alcohol consequences due to frequent HED. Individual-level alcohol
interventions have limited efficacy among Greek members, which may be because these approaches do not
directly account for the greater social ecological and developmental factors which play a significant role in
drinking behavior. Young adulthood is marked by an emphasis on developing and maintaining social bonds,
and alcohol use is an integral part of social interactions in the Greek environment. This study integrates
developmental and behavioral economic models of alcohol use to develop and test an environmental
intervention addressing HED and alcohol consequences. The intervention focuses on increasing the availability
of and engagement in rewarding alcohol-free social activities, providing alternatives to drinking events for
building social connections. Human-centered design principles will incorporate the perspectives of Greek
members in the intervention development process to increase usability and contextual fit. This innovative study
will proceed in three phases following the Discover, Design/Build, Test framework. Discover Phase: Greek
members' perspectives and needs on social activity engagement will be identified by conducting qualitative
interviews (N = 30) and a quantitative survey (N = 925) to better understand the intervention setting and the
context of social activity engagement in the Greek community. Design/Build Phase: The intervention will be
developed and refined in collaboration with Greek members involving co-creation sessions and iterative
feasibility and acceptability testing. Test Phase: Feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and the impact
of the intervention on alcohol outcomes will be evaluated using a pre-post design with two cohorts of six
chapters over two years. This Career Development Award will support the investigator's development as an
independent researcher focusing on the development of alcohol interventions addressing reward processes
among young adults who engage in high-risk alcohol use. The investigator's long-term career goals will be
achieved through training in 1) developmental and reinforcement-based models of young adult high-risk
alcohol use, 2) research methods for measuring and increasing substance-free reinforcement, 3) developing
collaborative relationships with community partners, and 4) research approaches that emphasize acceptability,
effectiveness, and potential for successful implementation. Dr. Lehinger's career goals and project are
consistent with NIAAA's prevention goals of a) developing and evaluating strategies to prevent and reduce
alcohol misuse among young adults and b) evaluating the effectiveness and implementation of environmental
interventions for preventing alcohol misuse."

The parent grant investigates wound-induced syncytia in an epithelium in vivo – from how
syncytia form to how they participate in closing wounds to how they are eliminated after a
wound closes. We specifically analyze syncytia around laser wounds, and the laser ablation is
conducted on a confocal microscope, allowing us to image before, during, and after ablation
with very high temporal resolution – as fast as a 30-millisecond frame rate. Our current Nd:YAG
laser generates a gradient of damage across the wound bed, with the central area comprised of
cell lysis, and a peripheral area of plasma membrane damage from which cells can recover.
We have evidence that syncytia arise from the fusion of cells within the region of plasma
membrane damage: wound-induced epithelial fusions localize to this area, and cells begin to
share their cytoplasmic contents with their neighbors within 500 ms after wounding, suggesting
that the damaged membranes are fusogenic. What we need, however, is to administer laser
wounds in such a way that they do not generate plasma membrane damage; if we can do this,
we predict that no syncytia would form. Our current laser is not suited to this task, so we
propose to purchase a compact fiber laser with sub-100-fs pulses, which would deliver uniform
damage across the wound area in a fraction of a second. This equipment, not available
anywhere on campus, would allow us to complete the aims of the parent proposal."
11034782,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The primary cilium is a micron-scale structure that protrudes from the surface of most cells in the human
body. Once thought to be vestigial, the cilium has recently been shown to have key roles in embryonic
development, sensory perception, and tissue homeostasis. Two key functions of cilia give rise to these
physiologic roles: cilia are both organizing centers for diverse signaling pathways and structures whose assembly
and disassembly is tightly linked to progression through the cell cycle. Consistent with these roles, ciliary defects
cause pediatric disorders known as ciliopathies and can promote tumorigenesis. These recent discoveries have
highlighted the importance of cilia but also underscored many gaps in our knowledge. Key questions include:
how are cilia assembled, maintained, and disassembled, how do proteins traffic to and from cilia, how do cilia
promote signaling, and how is cilium disassembly linked to cell cycle progression? At present, many gene
products that support cilium function have yet to be identified or characterized in detail, and thus the answers to
these questions remain elusive.
 My lab aims to understand the molecular basis of mammalian primary cilium function by combining cell-
based assays with new approaches we have developed including CRISPR-based functional screening and in
vitro reconstitution in semi-permeabilized cells. In particular, we recently conducted a genome-wide screen to
identify genes required for cilium-dependent signaling through the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway. This screen
identified hit genes with high precision and sensitivity, revealed new genes required for cilium assembly and Hh
signaling, and suggested new connections between cilia and disease. We now propose to build on this screen
by 1) functionally characterizing newly identified hit genes, including a Rab GTPase that we find to be required
for ciliogenesis and to localize to cilia, and 2) adapting our CRISPR screening tools to systematically investigate
an aspect of cilium function that remains poorly understood: the regulated disassembly of primary cilia. Our work
on cilium disassembly will focus on the hypothesis that cilium disassembly is monitored in a checkpoint-like
manner and may be dysregulated in cases of uncontrolled cell growth, such as during tumorigenesis. In addition
to conducting a genetic screen to identify mediators and regulators of cilium disassembly, we will dissect the
mechanism of disassembly through complementary live-imaging assays and in vitro reconstitution. These latter
experiments will take advantage of a semi-permeabilized cell system I developed that allows powerful
biochemical analysis of ciliary processes, including cilium disassembly.
 Taken together, this project aims to provide fundamental insights into primary cilia that will broaden our
understanding of the cell cycle, protein trafficking, signal transduction, and organelle biogenesis. Additionally,
these studies will help to reveal how ciliary defects contribute to ciliopathies and tumorigenesis."

Alport syndrome is the second most common cause of hereditary chronic kidney disease and is
caused by mutations in the type IV collagen genes encoding 3, 4 and 5 chains. X-linked Alport
syndrome (XLAS) accounts for most cases and is caused by mutations of the 5 chain. Therapies
to slow the progression of XLAS are limited and affected males invariably progress to end stage
kidney disease. The disease is known to affect glomeruli: the 3, 4 and 5 (IV) chains are
deposited by podocytes into the glomerular basement membrane, and patients with Alport
syndrome have structural defects in the glomerular basement membrane that causes hematuria
and proteinuria. Despite this, there are major gaps in our understanding of disease pathogenesis.
It is known that other cell types in the kidney produce 3, 4 and 5 chains, but to date, their
function and the role they play in tubule function and disease pathogenesis has been unexplored.
Based on preliminary studies, we hypothesize that 5 from non-glomerular cells is required for
normal cell function and shape, and that the non-glomerular cell abnormalities contribute
substantially to the clinical presentation and pathogenesis of XLAS. We therefore propose to 1)
identify the glomerular and non-glomerular contributions to XLAS pathogenesis and progression,
2) establish the function(s) of 5 in tubular cells, including elucidating signaling pathways that
underlie its role in tubular cells. Together, these studies will generate resources to study type IV
collagen function and will greatly advance knowledge of the pathogenesis of XLAS. We expect
they may also pave the way for future studies that lead to the development of novel therapeutic
strategies."

Reduced beta cell mass underlies insulin deficiency leading to hyperglycemia in type 1 diabetes (T1D). Restoring
autonomous glucose control in T1D requires beta cell replacement therapy, which is dependent on strategies to
regenerate endogenous beta cells and expand islets ex vivo for transplant. However, there are no current
therapeutic approaches to regenerate beta cells for people with T1D. Thus, our long-term goal is to identify
targets to expand beta cell mass in order to restore glucose control for patients with T1D. To address this, we
established a robust model of beta cell expansion through acute whole-body disruption of the leptin receptor
(LepR). We found LepR deletion induces durable and remarkable beta cell expansion, even in ~2-year-old mice.
Unbiased approaches nominated the transcription factor GA-binding protein (GABP) as a novel regulator of beta
cell metabolism and proliferation. GABP is an ETS transcription factor that forms a heterodimeric complex with
GABPa as the obligate DNA binding subunit. However, the function of GABPa in beta cells is unknown. Our
preliminary data show glucose induces GABPA expression in human islets. Studies in other cell types
demonstrated GABP is required for mitochondrial biogenesis, oxidative phosphorylation, and cell cycle regulation.
These cellular functions are essential to generate ATP and synthesize key molecular building blocks to support
cell proliferation. Nutrient and mitogenic signals also converge on GABP, providing further evidence that GABP
is a rate limiting transcription factor that responds to increases in metabolic demand to stimulate cell proliferation.
Thus, we hypothesize that GABP couples expression of metabolism and cell cycle genes to promote beta cell
proliferation. In this proposal we will pursue the Aim to define the mechanistic role of GABP in human and mouse
beta cell proliferation. To accomplish this, we will leverage beta cell specific Gabpa knockout mice to quantify
the in vivo physiologic and proliferation responses to increased metabolic demand. In human islets studies, we
will deplete GABPa to assay beta cell function, proliferation, and mitochondrial respiration following nutrient
stimulation and pursue mechanistic studies via metabolomics and genome-wide approaches. These
experiments will reveal how GABPa drives beta cell proliferation in response to metabolic demand and will direct
new strategies to expand beta cells for people with T1D."

Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are a major source of mortality and morbidity and affect about two million
patients each year. Within hospitals, pathogens like Clostridioides difﬁcile and methicillin-resistant Staphylococ-
cus aureus (MRSA) are routinely transmitted to and among hospitalized patients: also of particular concern are
multidrug resistant organisms (MDROs), because HAIs caused by these pathogens are increasingly difﬁcult to
treat. These infections can be ampliﬁed in hospitals, transmitted to other hospitals, long-term or skilled-care facil-
ities, and then, eventually, to the community at large. Developing effective interventions to prevent the spread of
HAIs remains an important public health goal, and demands some means by which the effectiveness of proposed
interventions (or combinations thereof) can be efﬁciently and inexpensively compared. In ﬁelds where experi-
ments are not possible, mathematical models and simulations can yield insight into how a system responds to
the intervention under study.
 The overarching theme of this project is to overcome existing barriers for modeling the spread of HAIs. We
hypothesize that high-ﬁdelity models derived from complex, ﬁne-grained data can be used to understand the
acquisition and transmission of HAIs within and across healthcare facilities. Simulations based on our models
can be used to compare alternative interventions and provide effective and practical guidance for how to reduce
the transmission of MDROs and other pathogens capable of causing HAIs."
11031920,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Antimicrobial resistant (AR) pathogens remain a major cause of healthcare associated infections (HAIs) in the
United States. Indeed, the prevalence of these existing and emerging drug-resistant agents continues to
impose a heavy burden on U.S. healthcare systems. To better control existing AR pathogen-associated HAIs
and prepare for the possible emergence of a novel AR organism, better, more targeted identification and
intervention strategies need to be developed. Here, for this Modeling Infectious Diseases in Healthcare
Research Projects to Improve Prevention Research and Healthcare Delivery (MInD Healthcare) network
project, we propose to develop a hierarchy of new model-inference systems capable of simulating and
forecasting HAI outbreaks, quantifying individual patient colonization risk, and identifying optimal intervention
approaches. Specifically, we will use hospitalization records and diagnostic data for multiple AR pathogens
from four major hospitals in New York City to conduct a series of modeling studies. We will develop two
mathematical modeling structures: 1) a metapopulation model capable of simulating AR pathogen transmission
dynamics across multiple healthcare facilities; and 2) an agent-based model capable of simulating individual-
level patient infection status, transmission dynamics, and movements within multiple hospitals. These models
will be used in conjunction with Bayesian inference methods to simulate observed outbreaks of AR pathogens,
estimate critical epidemiological characteristics and asymptomatic carriage probabilities among individual
patients, and support development of an AR pathogen forecasting system. As the models are high dimension
and the observations are sparse, new inference methods, capable of data augmentation and efficient model
optimization, will also be developed. Additionally, we will use the optimized model structures to run free
simulations testing the effectiveness of six interventions: 1) hand hygiene and barrier precautions; 2) isolation
of infections; 3) environmental cleaning; 4) active patient screening within hospitals; 5) contact tracing; and 6)
screening at admission. These interventions will be tested singly and in bundles and used to inform targeted
control approaches. Further, we will develop a framework for identifying intervention bundles that maximally
reduce HAI rates given cost and logistical constraints. Lastly, we propose to collaborate with the CDC and the
other research groups in the MInD Healthcare network to develop standardized intervention scenarios and
inter-comparisons of simulated intervention outcomes among the different model forms used across the
network."

11035756,"Alzheimer’s disease is the most common incurable form of dementia affecting 50 million
individuals worldwide. Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) is the strongest genetic risk factor that is directly
linked to its pathogenesis. ApoE is a cholesterol- and lipid-carrier protein that has been implicated in
Alzheimer’s disease, aging, and other neurological disorders. Isoform-dependent effect on amyloid
accumulation and clearance have been found in humans and mice with APOE4 being detrimental.
Haploinsufficiency of ApoE4 and possibly ApoE3 decreases amyloid pathology. Low Density
Lipoprotein Receptor (LDLR) plays an important role in the endocytosis of ApoE proteins. LDLR
overexpression has been found to decrease ApoE levels and inhibit amyloid formation. Additionally,
ApoE’s role in lipidation influences Alzheimer’s pathogenesis. ATP-binding cassette transporter A1
(AbcA1) protein transfers cellular cholesterol onto extracellular lipid-poor apolipoproteins.
Overexpression of ABCA1 gene has also been found to inhibit amyloid formation. Therefore, we set
out to develop small organic molecules that can increase AbcA1 and/or Ldlr while decreasing ApoE
protein levels. Such compounds would likely reduce and clear amyloid plaque deposition in affected
brains and provide therapeutic benefit in Alzheimer’s disease.
 Five triarylmethyl amine (TAMA) small molecules emerged as first leads decreasing ApoE
protein level (>30% reduction in the human astrocytoma brain cell line, analyzed using ELISA). The
mechanism of action of the TAMA pharmacophore was via LXR antagonism. Structure-Activity
Relationship (SAR) studies on the TAMA pharmacophore in five phases of focused libraries, identified
five drug-like tertiaryl sulfonamides and aryl amines as new leads. They not only decreased ApoE levels
in vitro, but also increased AbcA1/Ldlr protein levels validated by concentration-dependent studies.
Three chiral leads in pure R/S forms had disproportionate effects on ApoE and AbcA1 raising the
possibility of multiple targets. One of the 8 leads, compound 127 modulated the target proteins in the
transgenic mice brains in preliminary in vivo studies. The successful in vivo efficacy of 127 validates its
ability to pass the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Preliminary in vitro toxicological experiments revealed all
the 8 lead compounds to be not toxic.
 The SuRE support will enable PI and his undergraduate/graduate research team to utilize the
TAMA pharmacophore with critical appendages identified in newer and more potent sulfonamide leads
to generate new and novel scaffolds-based leads. These scaffolds are expected to be lighter, drug-like,
chemically and pharmacokinetically stable, and less lipophilic. PI aims at performing chemical synthesis
and biological screening in his lab with the guidance of a committed consultant."

Pore-forming membrane channels are central mediators of many complex biological phenomena; such as
synchronizing the contraction of our heart and electro-chemical signals in our brain, and detecting light, sound,

spatially and temporally modulate their cellular activity. Our research group is focused on understanding how
these types of phenomena are choreographed by remarkably complex strategies of cell-to-cell communication,
through the gap junctions. We aim to develop a molecular and atomic-level of mechanistic understanding of
how gap junctions coordinate inter-cellular communication. To achieve this level of detail, we are combining

medical relevance, membrane proteins still only represent ~4% of the protein structure database. However,
recent advances in the field of high-resolution CryoEM, coupled with advancements in membrane protein
biochemistry and in situ imaging technologies, are beginning to revolutionize the way we structurally
characterize these proteins. With these tools in hand, we are addressing several key questions about gap
junction assembly, selectivity and regulation. The results of our investigations are expected to provide an
architectural framework and the mechanistic knowledge required for the rational development of targeted
therapies against a range of gap junction related diseases, such as blindness, deafness, arrhythmia, stroke
and cancers."
11036033,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Persistent cell migration is fundamental for immune responses, development, and the dissemination of cancer
cells. This migration requires the establishment and maintenance of stable cell polarity, even while a cell
integrates noisy heterogeneous cues from its environment. To achieve this, Rho family GTPases act as central
hubs that organize signaling cascades and cytoskeletal rearrangements into subcellular domains. Feedback and
crosstalk connections are thought to be central to this pattern-forming ability. However, the wiring of this circuit
is still incompletely understood, and there are major gaps in our understanding of how negative regulators limit
and separate spatial domains. Determining these molecular connections in migrating leukocytes would identify
new therapeutic targets for treating inflammation and would be broadly relevant for understanding Rho GTPase
function in many cell types and biological processes. Major obstacles to progress have been the fast timescale
and inherently spatial nature of the signaling system. To address these challenges, we have developed new
molecular tools that allow us to control the activity of individual key components with light while measuring the
response of a second component with subcellular resolution in live single cells. Our preliminary results indicate
that in addition to acting as outputs to move the cell, different actin assemblies are intimately involved in the
biochemical wiring of Rho GTPase crosstalk. We have identified an “actin-gated” crosstalk connection between
RhoA and Cdc42, and we have identified the protein Arhgap30 as a previously unappreciated primary regulator
of Cdc42 that is critical for polarization and migration in leukocytes. We hypothesize that different actin
assemblies act as scaffolds to localize regulators of Rho GTPase crosstalk, creating subcellular zones with
distinct signal wiring to promote stable cell polarity. Specifically, we aim to 1) determine how branched actin
assembly regulates Cdc42 and RhoA activities in leukocyte cells, 2) determine how the local actin network
structure controls crosstalk between RhoA and Cdc42, and 3) determine the regulation and role of Arhgap30 in
crosstalk and polarity signaling. Our approach will combine new tool sets for optical control of signaling and
cytoskeletal components with simultaneous measurement of actin assemblies and Rho GTPase activities in
single cells. In combination, we will use chemical perturbations, mutational analysis, and biochemical
approaches to characterize molecular connections. Our long-term goals are to determine how reciprocal
regulation between actin and Rho GTPases creates robust polarity in multiple cell types, including leukocytes
and disseminating cancer cells. The proposed research will advance our basic understanding of how biochemical
signaling pathways both generate and stabilize subcellular domains to control behaviors such as cell migration."
11032466,"Microtubules (MTs) are a major component of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton, and their formation and activity are a
primary driver of cellular architecture. MT formation in the cell requires the presence of a universal MT nucleation
module, made up of the γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC), which acts as a template for tubulin assembly into MTs,
and its co-nucleator, XMAP215. The formation of specialized MT-based structures relies on biochemical
pathways that recruit and activate γ-TuRC at specific sites. Previously, it was thought that all MTs originated from
centrosomes. However, we now know that this is not correct and that there are numerous other MT organizing
centers (MTOCs). The mitotic spindle is an excellent example of MT assembly, and will be the focus of Aim 1 in
the proposed K99. In acentrosomal spindles, chromosomes act as the primary drivers of MT nucleation through
a gradient of activated RanGTP. Downstream of Ran, the augmin complex recruits γ-TuRC to form new MTs from
pre-existing ones in a pathway called branching MT nucleation. Branching MT nucleation amplifies MT mass
while conserving polarity and we now know that branching MT nucleation is responsible for generating the bulk
of MTs in the spindle. The pressing question driving K99 Aim 1 is how, precisely, does a spindle emerge from
branched MT networks? In this aim, I will use in vitro reconstitution to determine how branched MTs undergo
nucleation near chromosomes during early spindle assembly, and how these branched networks mature into a
spindle. My research will elucidate how single MTs that are a mere 25 nm in diameter self-organize into a micron-
scale structure that performs essential functions of the cell. Then, in Aim 2 of the K99, I will uncover which spindle
assembly factors are used to build other MT-based structures. Specifically, I will perform a targeted RNAi screen
using Drosophila dendritic arborization (da) neurons, which display highly elaborate patterning, as a model
system to determine which acentrosomal MT nucleation effectors have a role in dendrite formation. Finally, in
the R00 phase of my research, I will determine how MTs are nucleated in dendrites throughout development,
and how this nucleation contributes to dendrite patterning observed in mature neurons. To do this, in R00 Aim 1,
I will use super-resolution imaging to precisely quantify where MTOCs appear in dendrites and explore how
MTOCs execute MT nucleation using acentrosomal pathways. In Aim 2 of the R00 section, I will perform proximity
labeling and use expansion microscopy with super-resolution imaging to define the nanoscale protein
architecture of dendritic MTOCs, yielding key insights about the role of MT nucleation in driving dendrite
morphogenesis, which ultimately gives rise to neuronal function. Each phase of my research will prepare me to
run an independent research lab, with the goal of using my skills to substantially advance understanding of
cellular architecture and how architecture both gives rise to and controls cellular functions and processes."

Anastasis is a newly discovered cell recovery mechanism that rescues apoptotic cells from the brink of
death. Challenging the classic view of irreversible apoptosis, we have discovered robust reversibility of
apoptosis in three types of mouse/rat primary cells, twelve human cancer cell lines, and egg chambers in fruit
flies. What are the physiological functions, pathological roles, and therapeutic potentials of anastasis?
Anastasis could be an unexpected cytoprotective mechanism for preserving terminally differentiated cells
and tissues that are difficult to replace, such as cardiomyocytes and neurons. If true, enhancing anastasis
may be beneficial for treating heart failure and brain injury. Besides, anastasis could be an unrecognized
escape tactic enabling cancer cells to survive cancer therapy, thereby contributing to disease recurrence. If
confirmed, suppressing anastasis in dying cancer cells may promote cancer cell death and reduce the chances
of recurrence. Anastasis may also play important roles in limiting apoptosis during embryonic development
and normal homeostasis. If identified, understanding its regulation can provide new insights into the control of
cell death and survival in physiological conditions. However, there are several challenges of testing these
hypotheses. It is difficult to track anastasis, especially in vivo, because cells that have reversed apoptosis are
morphologically indistinguishable from healthy cells. There are no anastasis-specific hallmarks identified, and
the regulators of anastasis remain undiscovered. Here, we will overcome many of these challenges by
developing a novel and highly specific tracking system to label anastatic cells for mammalian studies, and to
identify the key regulators of anastasis. To mark anastatic cells, we will create an anastasis biosensor
that can tag anastatic cells with permanent expression of a fluorescent protein only after they have
recovered from late-stage apoptosis. We will establish anastasis biosensor stable cell lines to determine
reversibility of apoptosis in vitro, and will employ biosensor xenografts to interrogate anastasis in vivo using
clinically relevant mouse models. To elucidate the mechanism of anastasis, we will identify its key
regulators, through proteomics, genetics, and pharmacological approaches. We will identify which genes
exhibit up- or down-expression (potential anastasis regulators, and therapeutic targets) during different
stages of anastasis, determine whether specific post-translational modifications distinguish anastatic cells,
establish whether cells that recover from different cell death inductions share similar molecular features, and
investigate how interfering with anastasis regulators could modulate the reversibility of apoptosis. We will
apply time-lapse live-cell confocal imaging to evaluate the functionality of anastasis biosensor,
characterize anastatic cells, and determine efficacy of anastasis-targeting agents in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo.
Successful completion of this project will generate essential tools and knowledge for studying anastasis, thereby
laying a strong foundation for developing revolutionary new therapeutic approaches by controlling anastasis."

Acoustic technologies such as optoacoustic (OA) imaging and ultrasound neuromodulation (USNM) are
poised to revolutionize deep tissue, high-resolution, large-scale, in vivo imaging and neurostimulation in
mammalian organisms. These advances are enabled by the high tissue penetrability of ultrasound (US)
waves, and present untapped and exciting opportunities for accessing structures throughout the mammalian
brain for precise control and measurement of neural activity. We have recently introduced hybrid tools for
parallel OA imaging with GCaMP-type indicators and US neuromodulation in the cortex in vivo. Despite these
advances, improvements in the spatial resolution, as well as the capability to make full use of the deep-tissue
access afforded by these modalities, are highly desirable. We propose to undertake technological
developments designed to optimize these methods for cellular resolution, deep-tissue functional imaging and
neurostimulation, through both optimization of hardware and ‘wet-ware’, such as near-infrared (NIR)
functional probes. These developments to optimize functional OA signals will enable imaging of neural activity
at tissue depths that far exceed those accessible with optical techniques alone. The new framework will then
be applied and tested in the mouse olfactory system, whose spatial-temporal scale of neural activity is well
matched to that of the proposed technique, and which will significantly benefit from a combined imaging and
perturbation strategy for linking large-scale odor-evoked neural activity in the olfactory bulb to mouse
behavior."

This LITE-2 (RFA-AI-21-018) initiative responds to a resurgent epidemic of methamphetamine (meth) use in
sexual minority men (SMM), which is a primary driver of HIV incidence. The overarching goals are two-fold:
1) identify multi-level and bio-behavioral determinants of amplified HIV seroconversion risk in meth-using SMM;
and 2) test the effectiveness of telehealth motivational enhancement interventions for optimizing entry or re-entry
of SMM who use meth into the PrEP care continuum. Findings from our LITE-1 cohort (UG3/UH3 AI-133675,
RFA-AI-16-031) and others provide compelling evidence that meth use is increasing, disproportionally impacts
racial/ethnic minorities, and accounts for one-in-three new HIV infections in SMM. In response to LITE-2 (RFA-
AI-21-018) we propose a multi-component initiative zeroing in on the “Where,” “How,” and “Why” of meth use
and HIV risk. Where: What are the geospatial determinants of the association of meth use with HIV incidence?
How: How can we support (re-)entry into the PrEP care continuum with this high priority population of SMM who
use meth? Why: Does meth amplify biological risk of HIV by potentiating rectal immune dysregulation? Aim 1:
Examine multi-level structural, psychological, and social determinants of amplified HIV seroconversion risk in
SMM who use meth. The centerpiece of our LITE-2 initiative is a new prospective, bio-behavioral cohort with
N=5,000 SMM (n=3,000 SMM who use meth, n=2,000 who do not). Participants will complete assessments over
36 months and provide biological samples for HIV testing, drug toxicology testing, rectal STIs, and rectal
cytokines/chemokines. Our primary goal will be to investigate the role of geospatial determinants (e.g.,
background meth and HIV prevalence, urbanicity) and other structural determinants (e.g., structural stigma of
sexual minorities as evidenced by policies/laws) in relation to the association of meth use with amplified HIV
seroconversion risk. Aim 2: Test the comparative and combined effectiveness of telehealth motivational
enhancement interventions for optimizing PrEP use. PrEP Readiness Interventions for Supporting Motivation
(PRISM) is a hybrid type I, modified factorial randomized controlled trial (RCT) of telehealth CM that provides
incentives for filling a PrEP prescription, and a 2-session telehealth MI intervention that we adapted with meth-
using SMM (R34-DA046367, Carrico/Grov). PRISM will enroll 840 meth-using SMM who are not currently taking
PrEP from the LITE-2 cohort (Aim 1) to examine the effectiveness of CM (n = 280), MI (n = 280), and MI+CM (n
= 280) on the primary outcome – filling a PrEP prescription. Aim 3: Determine whether greater rectal immune
dysregulation partially explains amplified risk of HIV seroconversion in SMM who use meth. Using a case-cohort
design, we will compare HIV seroconverters (n=450) with matched seronegative controls (n=450) to examine
the clinical relevance of meth-induced alterations in rectal cytokines with respect to HIV seroconversion. This
LITE-2 initiative could have an exceptional impact by transforming HIV prevention with SMM."
11032500,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This project develops new experimental and computational methods for DEER (double electron-
electron resonance) spectroscopy. DEER is a biostructural technique for the quantification of
protein conformational landscapes and protein motions on the nanometer scale. Protein motions
are crucial for many key molecular processes at the basis of human life and disease. Therefore,
DEER provides important insights that contribute to the knowledge base necessary for drug
development. In combination with X-ray crystallography, cryo-EM, NMR, FRET and others,
DEER is part of a complementary set of integrative experimental biostructural tools. It is
especially important for the study of membrane proteins. Several major barriers exist in the field:
the lack of integrated analysis and modeling tools for biomedical researchers, and the lack of
experimental approaches for studying proteins in their native cellular environment. This project
directly addresses these issues as it aims to (a) develop methods and tools based on Bayesian
statistics and deep learning for the rigorous and reproducible analysis of experimental DEER
data; (b) create advanced computational approaches that utilize DEER data for modeling
proteins; (c) develop methodology based on noncanonical amino acids for labeling proteins
directly in their cellular environment; (d) advance a rapid freeze quench approach to measure
conformational dynamics down to the sub-millisecond time scale. Overall, the goal of the project
is to significantly expand the scope of DEER by providing innovative approaches to data
analysis, modeling, and in-cell and time-resolved measurements. This will enable the study of
the structure and dynamics of larger and more complex proteins and protein assemblies in the
cellular environment. This is of increasing importance in biomedical research."
11032513,"Project Summary
The largest class of genetic alterations that cause disease are single point mutations. Most of
these disease-causing errors can be remedied if a specific adenosine is changed to guanosine
on the RNA transcript. This proposal aims to repurpose an RNA editing enzyme and direct it to
selectively edit targeted adenosines in mRNA to treat genetic disorders. The RNA editing enzyme
Adenosine Deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) can convert adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) by
catalyzing a deamination reaction on the nucleobase. Inosine is read as guanosine by the cellular
translation machinery providing the ability to alter codons in mRNA. This proposal will focus on
selectively editing disease-causing nonsense mutations, by directing ADAR to edit the adenosine
in the stop codon thus allowing the transcript to continue translation, producing functional full-
length protein. Because ADARs selectively edit adenosines in regions of dsRNA, disease-causing
nonsense mutations can be selectively targeted by furnishing an appropriate guide
oligonucleotide to create a dsRNA substrate. Canonical Watson-Crick complementarity of duplex
RNA does not produce efficient substrates for ADARs, making it challenging to design effective
guide oligonucleotides to target specific nonsense mutations. A high-throughput assay is
proposed to search all sequence space of guide RNA oligonucleotides to identify lead sequences
displaying high editing efficiency of the targeted nonsense transcript using endogenous ADARs.
These lead sequences can be further optimized by structure-guided rational design methods. The
lab has significant experience in determining ADAR-RNA structures to atomic resolution and
leveraging this knowledge to improve editing efficiency. Both X-ray crystallography and Cryo-EM
techniques are proposed for ADAR1 or ADAR2 complexed with dsRNA of the lead sequence
bound to its targeted mRNA segment. These structures will provide the basis for rational design
adjustments to develop nucleotide analogs to incorporate into guide oligonucleotides that can
fashion structural features for improved editing and increased metabolic stability. This method of
site-directed RNA editing (SDRE) to treat genetic disorders offers many advantages over current
editing tools, which often require addition of sizable proteins (e.g., CRISPR/Cas). When fully
developed, this method would permit the simple administration shorter oligonucleotides allowing
the cell’s endogenous ADARs to recode the nonsense mutation to treat many genetic disorders."
11035777,"Summary Abstract: Protein Networks as Synergistic Drivers of Membrane Remodeling
Membrane curvature is required for many cellular processes, from assembly of highly curved trafficking vesicles
to extension of needle-like filopodia. Consequently, defects in membrane curvature play a role in most human
diseases, including altered recycling of receptors in cancer and diabetes, targeting of filopodia by pathogens,
and hijacking of vesicle traffic during virus replication. Therefore, understanding the basic molecular mechanisms
that drive membrane remodeling is essential to our knowledge of cellular physiology and human disease.
 Research on membrane curvature has primarily focused on individual protein domains with specialized
structures, such as crescent-shaped scaffolds and wedge-like amphipathic insertions. While this work has
provided invaluable insights, this “structure-centric” perspective ignores two essential facts. First, most
membrane remodeling proteins contain large intrinsically disordered domains in addition to structured domains.
And second these disordered domains drive assembly of large, multi-valent protein networks.
During the past 5 years, our group has made pioneering discoveries in support of the hypothesis
that disordered protein networks are essential drivers of membrane remodeling in the cell. Specifically,
using clathrin-mediated endocytosis as a model pathway, we showed that intrinsically disordered domains
generate steric pressure at membrane surfaces. This pressure provides a surprisingly potent driving force for
membrane bending, especially when coupled synergistically to the contributions of structured domains. This
work was the first to reveal the membrane remodeling abilities of disordered proteins, examples of which have
since been discovered in diverse areas of biology. Additionally, we have recently found that disordered domains
within endocytic proteins drive assembly of liquid-like protein networks which efficiently initiate endocytosis.
Importantly, this liquid-like behavior has the potential to resolve a long-standing paradox by explaining how
curved membrane structures can be simultaneously highly interconnected, yet dynamic and flexible.
 These findings suggest urgent questions about the role of disordered protein networks in the key steps
of membrane remodeling: (i) initiation, (ii) curvature induction, and (iii) cargo selection. First, how do protein
networks initiate remodeling events, controlling their spatial and temporal dynamics? Second, once an event is
initiated, how do protein networks bend membranes, stabilizing either a convex or a concave shape? Third, as
the membrane bends, how does the protein network select cargo, such as transmembrane proteins, which are
essential to the structure’s biological function? Building on our recent discoveries, this work will shift the paradigm
for understanding membrane curvature beyond its present focus on in vitro structure-function relationships
toward an understanding of disordered protein networks. By demonstrating novel synergistic mechanisms, this
research will provide a blueprint for the study of protein networks at membrane surfaces throughout the cell."

Over 223,000 patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) are hospitalized in the United States annually, with
more than 166 deaths each day. It has been demonstrated over the past two decades of clinical research that
cortical spreading depolarizations (CSDs), also known as “brain tsunamis,” are waves of electrical activity that
occur in 60% of patients with TBI. CSDs are waves of massive neuronal depolarization that cause periods of
electrical silencing and are independently associated with worse 6-month outcomes in TBI patients. It is
unknown whether CSDs cause damage beyond the area of local cortical spread, and it is unknown how CSDs
cause poor outcomes after TBI. We hypothesize that CSDs disrupt connections between the cortex and
hippocampus and hence contribute to poor cognitive outcomes. We will test this hypothesis in an experimental
model of TBI and CSDs. We will define CSDs effects on axonal pathology and synaptic connections.
Understanding how CSDs influence local and remote brain connectivity will provide insight into how CSDs after
TBI may contribute to poor outcomes. Additionally, this project will allow Ms. Bishop to develop critical thinking
skills, advance her scientific knowledge, and help her reach her career goal of being a physician-scientist."

Inherited retinal degenerations (IRDs) are genetic diseases that lead to the progressive loss of
photoreceptors and the permanent loss of vision. Wild-type zebrafish regenerate photoreceptors
after acute injury by reprogramming Müller glia into stem-like cells that produce retinal progenitors.
This regenerative process fails to occur in zebrafish models of IRDs. This proposal will address the
critical unanswered question as to why zebrafish mutants with chronic inflammation fail to regenerate.
Our preliminary data show that Notch pathway inhibition can promote photoreceptor regeneration in
the zebrafish cep290 and bbs2 models of progressive degeneration and that immunosuppression
prevents photoreceptor loss. These results offer insight into the pathways that promote Müller glia-
dependent regeneration and the role of inflammation in photoreceptor degeneration. Our central
hypothesis is that in zebrafish models of retinal degeneration, chronic inflammation results in elevated
Notch and NF-kB signaling that restricts the regenerative response to acute injury. Evidence from the
literature and our preliminary data rigorously demonstrate that Notch signaling in Müller glia differs in
response to acute injury or chronic degeneration. Understanding the link between pro-inflammatory
signaling from microglia and Notch signaling in Müller glia has not been previously addressed.
Furthermore, our current understanding of how inflammatory cytokines signal through the NF-kB
pathway has only been studied in the context of wild-type animals. The proposed studies will provide
critical insight into the relationship between microglia and Müller glia regeneration in chronic disease.
We will use state-of-the-art sequencing technologies to identify Müller glia- and microglia-specific
changes in gene expression in cep290 and bbs2 models in order to elucidate the relationship
between inflammation and regeneration. We will also identify and test specific ligand-receptor pairs
to identify the mechanisms that maintain Notch signaling in the zebrafish degeneration mutants and
identify key factors that stimulate NF-kB signaling. Understanding the mechanisms that underpin
retinal regeneration in multiple zebrafish disease models will generate novel hypotheses that can
ultimately be translated into humans with retinal degenerative diseases."
11035451,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The vagus nerves are important carriers of appetitive and nutritive information from the viscera to the central
nervous system (CNS). New studies are revealing surprising and striking differences between left and right
vagal-CNS connectivity. In particular, it was recently shown that activation of ascending gut projections through
the right, but not left, vagus nerve may activate classical dopaminergic “reward” circuits in the CNS. These recent
findings raise the intriguing possibility that electrical vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) delivered to the right cervical
nerve, rather than the traditionally-targeted left cervical nerve, could be used to modulate activity within these
reward networks, providing novel strategies for the treatment of movement disorders. However, both left and
right vagal fibers branch extensively in the periphery and carry information from the gut as well as liver, pancreas,
and other organs that may convey potentially rewarding nutritive or metabolic information. Additional research is
thus needed to fully understand the functional and translational relevance of lateralized vagal signaling.
Understanding whether and how lateralized vagal stimulation differentially activates reward networks is crucial
for further clinical development of this therapeutic technology. Left cervical VNS is currently FDA approved for
the treatment of epilepsy and major depressive disorders, and is rapidly emerging as a treatment to promote
weight loss, extinction of drug seeking, and motor rehabilitation after neural injuries. Importantly, the
effectiveness of VNS over this expanded set of therapeutic indications depends on optimal activation of the
dopaminergic pathways known to support reward-related reinforcement of learned behaviors. Thus, targeted
modulation of these pathways could provide additional mechanisms to induce therapeutic neuroplasticity within
the motor system. Delivery of VNS to the right cervical nerve may therefore offer additional benefits compared
to traditional left VNS for the treatment of motor dysfunction arising from, e.g., Parkinson’s disease or stroke.
While evidence of strong laterality in vagal-midbrain connectivity is emerging, the extent to which right versus
left VNS evokes differential activation of central reward networks has not been systematically tested. Here, we
propose to comprehensively compare the dose-dependence of right vs. left VNS-driven midbrain activity, and to
test the functional relevance of lateralized VNS-driven dopaminergic signaling for the induction of neuroplasticity
within the motor system. We additionally examine the extent to which VNS-evoked midbrain activity and
behavioral reinforcement are impacted by known modulators of vagal signaling, including prior exposure to food
and food rewards. To elucidate the mechanisms of VNS-mediated reinforcement, we propose to record neural
activity and optogenetically manipulate dopaminergic signaling in the midbrain during VNS-reinforced behavior.
These studies will provide fundamental insights into the neurobiological mechanisms underlying lateralized vagal
signaling, informing the development of novel VNS strategies for therapeutic modulation of the dopamine system."

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a versatile pathogen, capable of infecting numerous human tissues and inflicting
irreversible, life-threatening damage. Not only can P. aeruginosa survive on the nutrients released from the
damaged host cells and/or tissues, but importantly, this bacterium has the propensity to adapt and protect itself
from any defensive measures taken against it whether from the immune response of the host organism or
external remedies such as antibiotic treatments. It is the long-term goal of the proposed project to neutralize or
counter these key aspects of P. aeruginosa pathogenesis through the specific targeted disruption of the
enhancer-binding protein (EBP)-RpoN regulatory network. RpoN and EBPs interact with each other to activate
transcription of >200 target genes in P. aeruginosa. Many of the EBP-RpoN targeted genes are essential for the
utilization of host-derived nutrients and provide resistance against cell-damaging agents, including peroxides,
heat and antibiotics. The central hypothesis of the proposal is that the EBP NtrC regulates the expression of
amyloid fibrils − as well as additional proteins − that allow for P. aeruginosa to bind to eukaryotic cells and gain
a foothold in the host environment. The rationale for the proposed study is that knowledge of both the gene-
regulatory networks and pathogenic roles for NtrC will provide crucial insight into the molecular mechanisms and
signals that coordinate the adaptation of P. aeruginosa to a eukaryotic-host environment. In Specific Aim 1, the
regulon of NtrC will be defined. The chromosomal DNA-binding sites for NtrC will be determined via chromatin
immunoprecipitation with exonuclease treatment-high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-exo). Additionally, the
transcriptome of NtrC will be identified using RNA-seq. The results of the ChIP-exo and RNA-seq together will
identify the gene-regulatory network directly governed by NtrC. In Specific Aim 2, the roles of amyloid fibrils and
its regulator NtrC will be investigated in terms of adhesion and cytotoxicity towards eukaryotic cells. The
approach is innovative because it will establish whether amyloid fibrils and its regulator NtrC are required for cell
adhesion of P. aeruginosa in a host environment. It will also serve as a template for using ChIP-exo in the
characterization of EBPs or DNA-binding proteins in other pathogenic microorganisms. We are getting closer to
having a complete definition of EBP-RpoN regulation in this important human pathogen. The proposed project
is significant, because knowledge of this regulation and the resistance mechanisms it controls will facilitate the
development of antimicrobials and alternative approaches to counter the virulence or pathogenesis of P.
aeruginosa."

This administrative supplement for equipment is requesting funds for a Refeyn TwoMP Mass Photometer. Mass
photometry is a revolutionary new technology that enables highly sensitive and accurate mass measurements
of different types of biomolecules in solution without the need for labeling. This breakthrough technology derives
molecular mass from light scattered by single molecules and can be used to examine sample homogeneity,
assess oligomerization behavior, quantify biomolecular interactions, and measure the assembly or disassembly
of large multicomponent complexes, which is not possible with ensemble methods. Hence, mass photometry
provides a reliable and cost-effective means to rapidly screen biochemical conditions that are compatible with
our desired macromolecules and eliminate conditions that prevent complex formation.
 The Refeyn TwoMP enables accurate quantification of single biomolecules across a wide mass range,
from 30-kDa up to 5-MDa. Thus, the acquisition of the new mass photometer will directly benefit the project’s
research plan by enhancing our ability to identify and optimize sample conditions for large protein machines
(~1MDa) towards their 3D structure determination, which is within the original project scope. Currently, sample
preparation presents a major bottleneck in structure analysis work due to its inherent unpredictability and time-
consuming nature. Mass photometry provides an elegant and rational solution to this problem. Consequently,
the TwoMP mass photometer is crucial for the successful completion of the specific aims of the parent application
and to ensure that rapid progress is made continuously. The mass photometry technology is currently not
available at Baylor College of Medicine, and the requested Refeyn TwoMP mass photometer will be the first in
the greater Houston area. The TwoMP will provide a competitive advantage and will be available to other
researchers at the college and its neighboring academic institutions, providing enhanced user access to this
powerful new technology. The Tsai group will manage the new equipment that will be housed in dedicated
laboratory space. To maintain the mass photometer in peak condition, the biochemistry department is committed
to covering the annual maintenance of the TwoMP after the one-year installation warranty has expired."

The long-term goal of this proposal is to understand the regulatory mechanisms of U1 small nuclear
ribonucleoprotein (U1 snRNP) in snRNP biogenesis and its role in protein-coding gene regulation. U1 snRNP,
the most abundant RNP particle among the spliceosomal snRNP, plays a key role in excising introns (splicing)
and preventing premature termination of nascent transcripts (telescripting). Both activities are ensured by the
RNA:RNA base-pairing between U1 snRNA and 5’ splice site (5’ss). Pan-cancer patients possess multiple
mutations in the U1 snRNA, including 5’ss and U1 snRNP-specific protein binding sequences, which result in
alternative splicing of oncogenes and tumor suppressors through novel 5’ss recognition. However, our
preliminary data showed that those U1 snRNA mutations do not form a stable Sm core, a key intermediate
assembled by the SMN (survival of motor neuron) complex, which determines the stability and abundance of the
U1 snRNP in cells. Moreover, we identified that a U1 snRNP-specific U1C protein, previously known to stabilize
5’ss:U1 snRNA base-pairing, plays a critical role in regulating Sm core assembly of all snRNAs. The objective
of this proposal is to investigate the mechanism of the newly discovered role of U1C as a gatekeeper in snRNP
biogenesis, its potential contribution to the quality control of spliceosomes, and the regulatory mechanism in
splicing and telescripting activity. This project will simultaneously address both functions of U1C by harnessing
two established components to dissect the role of U1C in snRNP biogenesis as well as its involvement in intronic
polyadenylation and 3’UTR length changes, molecular characteristics of the oncogenes in cancer. We propose
to pursue three specific aims: 1) Elucidate the role of U1C with SMN complex as a gatekeeper in snRNP
biogenesis. 2) Investigate the effects of U1 snRNA mutations found in pan-cancer patients on Sm core assembly.
3) Examine the U1C interaction with mRNA 3’-end termination machinery in telescripting. Using biochemical
approaches, we will investigate the molecular connections between U1C-SMN complex and U1C-U1 snRNA.
By examining these connections, we can better understand how U1C controls the snRNP repertoire and
ultimately impact the function of spliceosome. Moreover, we will delineate the U1C’s interaction with mRNA 3’-
end processing machinery. This interaction is a key switch that can convert U1 snRNP from productive splicing
to premature mRNA termination or 3’UTR shortening through the loss of 5’ss binding. To elucidate the multi-
faceted regulation mechanism of U1C, we will employ in vitro Sm core assembly, RNA-affinity purification, in
vitro mRNA processing assays, and in-cell formaldehyde-crosslinking coupled with immunoprecipitation
methods. The expected outcome of this project will identify the role of U1C as a in snRNP biogenesis and mRNA
metabolism, thus explaining the consequence of the U1 snRNA mutations in pan-cancer and providing evidence
of gene regulation by the loss of telescripting activity."

Despite the critical importance of the O-glycoprotein apolipoprotein E (APOE) on Alzheimer’s disease (AD) risk,
with the APOE4 isoform increasing risk compared to APOE3 and APOE2 reducing it, the precise mechanism
behind this remains elusive. We have characterized APOE O-glycosylation using our quantitative glycoproteomic
targeted mass spectrometric approach showing that CSF and plasma APOE glycosylation differ greatly,
particularly in the lipid binding domain. We have also developed a range of APOE binding assays to determine
the impact of glycosylation on function. Our data using APOE from induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived
cells shows that glycosylation alters APOE binding properties. We also know that transferases, the enzymes that
add the monosaccharides to glycans, wane with age and sialyltransferases are reduced in AD and there are
differences in APOE modifications between APOE3.3 and APOE4.4 human brains. Together, this makes it
critical to fully understand APOE glycosylation. Thus, we hypothesize that APOE shows isoform-dependent
glycosylation and that aberrant glycosylation alters APOE binding properties, exacerbating AD
pathogenesis. We will use a range of glycobiology and iPSC techniques to address four Aims. Aim 1 will use
normal APOE isogenic iPSC-derived astrocytes and hepatocytes, the main producers of APOE. We will
characterize their APOE glycoprofiles and associated binding properties, to gain an understanding of tissue and
isoform-specific APOE glycosylation differences and their functional impacts. Transferase expression will be also
analyzed to further determine the mechanisms behind glycosylation differences. Aim 2 will compare astrocytes
derived from healthy and AD APOE isogenic iPSCs and determine how AD alters APOE glycosylation; how this
is altered between APOE isoforms, and how such changes impact APOE functions involved in AD pathogenesis.
Lipoprotein, receptor and Aβ binding will be compared. Finally, we will compare the APOE glycoprofiles of AD
and normal human brain samples to our iPSC data. Aim 3 will use normal APOE isogenic iPSCs to model aging
and AD by two methods to determine which more closely resembles the APOE glycosylation of AD. First by
reducing the specific sialyltransferase expression seen in aging and second by disrupting the Aβ environment
by introducing a known APP mutation. This will elucidate how pathogenic glycosylation changes begin. Aim 4
will address if astrocytes with aberrant APOE glycosylation alter neuronal network activity and amyloid
accumulation by co-culture with iPSC-derived neurons. Our micro-electrode array (MEA) analyses have shown
that the APOE genotype of astrocytes affects neuronal networks. We will use MEAs and measures of Aβ
accumulation to determine the effect of these aberrantly glycosylated cell lines on neurons. Ultimately we will
have characterized normal and AD isoform-specific APOE glycosylation and defined its impact on APOE
functions, especially those relating to AD pathogenesis. We will determine how aberrant APOE glycosylation is
a promoter of Aβ accumulation, AD pathogenesis and neuron network degeneration."
11022977,"PROJECT SUMMARY - PROJECT 2
There exists a vast diversity of observed lifespans across species. However, our understanding of the genetic,
molecular, and mechanistic underpinnings of aging differences between species remains largely unknown.
Within mammalian lineages alone, exceptional long and short lifespans have evolved multiple times. This
homoplasy renders evolution a powerful tool to identify mechanisms within humans and other species that
underlie lifespan differences. Furthermore, by understanding which aspects of human longevity are conserved
or divergent from other species at the molecular level,biologically relevant information is elucidated that can
influence our use of model organisms to test geroprotective therapies. However, identifying the individual
phylogenetic changes responsible for lifespan differences across species and linking them to phenotypic
effects at scale has remained a challenge for the field. This is due to both the complexity of cross-species
phylogenetic analysis and the difficulty in surveying gene regulatory elements at-scale which are known to be a
primary driver of evolutionary change. To address this The Longevity Consortium Cross Species and
Evolutionary Biology (CSEB) Project will integrate sophisticated evolutionary algorithms, high-throughput
functional genomics tools, and advanced phenotype-relevant neuronal models, to uncover the genetic basis of
longevity across species.
 First, we will leverage and expand on a large collection of multiomic data from hundreds of mammalian
species to construct a curated genomic database that is combined with longevity data. Using state-of-the-art
algorithms, many developed by members of the CSEB, we will identify genes, regulatory elements, and
pathways associated with differences in longevity across species. Second, we will deploy high-throughput
CRISPR screens to systematically perturb hundreds of longevity-associated loci in neurons and fibroblasts of 8
species. This allows us to build longevity gene-regulatory networks and assess their divergence across
species. Across these same species and cell types, we will use massively parallel reporter assays to
interrogate cis-regulatory elements and genetic variation within these elements to uncover the precise genetic
mechanism underlying longevity difference both across species and within the human population. Together,
these assays will (i) validate associations from our phylogenetic analysis and from findings from across the
consortium, and (ii) allow the construction of comprehensive gene regulatory models across multiple species
for use by the integrative analysis core. Lastly, we will extend the legacy cross-species fibroblast resource by
developing an iPSCs collection of 20 species allowing the functional characterization in differentiated cell
types."
11023016,"Our previous work has collected normative data for measures of both tinnitus perception and tinnitus functional
effects (reactions). Participants with chronic tinnitus, who were not receiving tinnitus-specific intervention,
completed tinnitus psychoacoustic measures and tinnitus questionnaires at 0, 1, 3, and 6 months. Participants
were included in each of six age ranges (18-30; 31-40; 41-50; 51-60; 61-70; 70+). These data will contribute to
age-specific reference values for the different measures once all data analyses are complete (final participant
testing occurred on October 30, 2018). The proposed study will extend and expand this effort by: (1) building
on the normative standards database by testing a cohort of new participants; (2) assessing long-term
repeatability of tinnitus psychoacoustic measures by obtaining additional longitudinal data from participants
recalled from the previous study; (3) developing methodology to evaluate individual pitch-perception ability and
providing training as needed; (4) evaluating the effect of pitch training on ability to match tinnitus pitch with
greater precision; and (5) continuing development of the tablet-based tinnitus evaluation system (TES) for
clinical utility by improving the interface and other performance features, and by creating a rapid assessment
program to obtain reliable loudness matches and pitch matches in under 10 minutes. To accomplish these
objectives, new participants will be enrolled into two separate cohorts of 150 and 100 individuals (total new
enrollment n=250). Both cohorts of new participants will meet the same inclusion criteria as used in the
previous study. The 150 new participants will undergo repeated testing at baseline and at 1, 3, and 6 months to
replicate testing as done during the previous study. The separate cohort of 100 new participants will be
enrolled to evaluate a training program for pitch matching. Of these, half will complete a program of pitch-
perception testing and training that will be administered prior to the start of baseline testing (comparison of
pitch matching data between groups with vs. without training will determine if the program improves within-
session reliability of the pitch matching test). Finally, a third cohort of 100 of the previous study's participants
will return to repeat testing ~3 years following their baseline testing to obtain long-term reliability data. In
addition to data collection, efforts will be ongoing to complete development and validation of the tablet-based
TES with the intent to ready this system for clinical application. A test protocol requiring 5-10 minutes is
needed for the TES to have the potential to achieve more widespread use among VA audiologists. A rapid TES
protocol will be developed, tested, and validated with a subset of participants to achieve this objective.
Completing the work described in this application will accomplish many objectives, including making tinnitus
psychoacoustic measures more useful and practical for clinical and research utilization."

B cell antigen receptor (BCR)-antigen interactions that govern the activation of B cells with a pre-vaccinated B-
cell repertoire are not clearly defined for HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) lineages. Our recent studies
show that B cell activation is dependent on antigen-binding association rate and not on the overall affinity (KD
value), indicating that antigen sensing has a kinetic component. In this renewal application we will expand our
studies to define the biophysical properties of antigen binding and cell surface interactions that lead to activation
of B cells expressing germline precursor or early lineage intermediate BCRs of different HIV-1 bnAb specificities
(CD4-binding site, V3-glycan). We will build upon our hypothesis that the exposure of the BCR to antigens that
bind with enhanced association kinetics leads to re-organization and localization of receptors with co-stimulatory
molecules on the B cell membrane, and together these parameters contribute to B cell activation and selection
of functional mutations that lead to the development of neutralization breadth. In Aim 1, we will use Ramos B
cell lines and purified BCR-complexes to perform biophysical interactions and structural analyses to define the
properties of BCR-antigen interactions that govern signaling and activation of bnAb precursors and selection of
functional mutations following immunizations in relevant knock-in mouse models. In Aim 2, we will define the
role of the CH1 domain in class-specific antigen sensing, and the role of the immunoreceptor coupling and
organization motifs (ICOM) interactome in the regulation and activation of HIV-specific BCRs on naïve and
memory-type B cells. In Aim 3, we will define priming and boosting immunogen activation ranges for bnAb
lineages to multiple Envelope targets and develop lineage-specific prime/boost combinations for testing in
physiologically relevant mouse models. The overall objective of this grant is to bridge quantitative measurements
of antigen-activated biophysical/biochemical events and B cell surface organization/interactions to optimal B cell
priming and boosting in relevant ex-vivo and in-vivo B cell activation models, and to use this information for
facilitating design and selection of immunogens for HIV-1 vaccine development."
11007561,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The majority of HIV worldwide is transmitted following heterosexual intercourse and women are twice as likely
to contract HIV from heterosexual sex than men. Mucosal tissues in the female genital tract (FGT) therefore
represent the frontline of transmission since they are the site at which HIV infection is first established in most
incident cases. FGT microbiota composed of diverse communities of bacteria with low Lactobacillus abundance
are associated with elevated mucosal inflammation, increased numbers of cervical HIV target cells, and over
four-fold higher risk of HIV acquisition. In our prior work with the FRESH (Females Rising through Education,
Support and Health) study, we demonstrated that these high-risk bacterial communities are present in over 60%
of young, healthy, black South African women. The specific mechanisms by which vaginal microbiota contribute
to HIV acquisition risk remain unknown. To address these knowledge gaps, we will utilize samples from 1200
FRESH participants with longitudinal blood and genital sampling, including pre- and post-infection samples from
102 women who went on to acquire HIV. In Aim 1.1 we will generate multi-omics datasets characterizing vaginal
microbiota utilizing metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, fungal internally transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing,
culturomics, microbial whole genome sequencing (WGS), and metabolomics. We will complement this in Aim
1.2 with a comprehensive characterization of the host FGT mucosal environment by assessing genital
inflammatory chemokines and cytokines, cervical flow cytometric cell phenotype, and cervical single cell RNA
sequencing (scRNAseq) profiles, combined with in-depth behavioral and demographic metadata. These complex
multi-omics datasets and metadata will then be integrated in Aim 1.3 following critical quality control,
transformation, and imputation of data from each modality. Modern supervised integration techniques will be
used to identify multi-omics profiles predictive of genital inflammation and HIV acquisition. Novel candidate
vaginal bacterial strains, functions, and/or metabolites will then be validated in Aim 2 using innovative in vitro
and in vivo models, including an organ-on-a-chip model, cervical and vaginal organoids, and a humanized mouse
model. [In addition, we will test candidate features and hypotheses based upon our extensive preliminary data
and established work in the field]. Overall, this project will identify specific bacterial strains and molecules, along
with host cellular lineages and sensing pathways, that mediate microbiota-induced genital inflammation and
increased HIV acquisition risk. It will also validate much needed novel model systems that test the interactions
of microbiota, host, and HIV to provide critical resources to develop the mechanistic understanding needed to
advance the field."
11009207,"ABSTRACT
SAMHD1 is a human immune factor that impedes infection of myeloid cells and resting T lymphocytes by HIV-
1. SAMHD1 is a deoxynucleotide triphosphate hydrolase (dNTPase), and the discovery of its anti-retroviral
activity brought to light a novel antiviral mechanism that depends on the enzymatically controlled depletion of
cellular dNTP pools. The ability of immune cells to use dNTP depletion for antiviral defense is puzzling,
because even quiescent and terminally differentiated cells require deoxynucleotides for DNA repair and
mitochondrial biogenesis. SAMHD1 is a key regulator of dNTP concentrations in nonproliferating cells and
better understanding of its enzymatic properties may shed light on the tantalizing relationship between dNTP
metabolism and antiviral immunity. Our recent work revealed that the 'facilitated dNTP depletion' function of
SAMHD1 arises from its allosteric activation mechanism, a two-step process involving tetramer assembly and
subsequent activation. Facilitated dNTP depletion enables regulatory crosstalk between biosynthesis and
depletion of different dNTPs and manifests as more robust depletion of some nucleotides when biosynthesis of
certain others is elevated. We hypothesize that the allosteric regulation of SAMHD1 is a key component to the
cellular decision-making mechanism that controls the switching between multiple discrete states of cellular
dNTP metabolism in nonproliferating immune cells and thus determines whether and when these cells become
non-permissive to HIV infection. In this project we seek to advance our understanding of how allosteric and
posttranslational regulation of SAMHD1 enables distinct states of dNTP metabolism by pursuing two specific
aims. In Aim 1 we will delineate how enzymatic properties of SAMHD1 give rise to the antiviral modalities of
dNTP homeostasis and enable immune and metabolic decision-making. We also seek to establish mechanistic
relationships between the distinct states of cellular dNTP metabolism and the susceptibility to HIV infection. In
Aim 2 we will elucidate the structural basis of allosteric and posttranslational regulation of SAMHD1. Our recent
findings reveal that SAMHD1 activation by dNTP substrates involves an inactive tetrameric intermediate with
partial dNTP occupancy of the allosteric sites. Here we will further elucidate the conformational repertoire of
SAMHD1 activation and how it is modulated by posttranslational modifications, nucleic acid ligands and
pathogenic mutations."

Climate change disproportionately affects vulnerable populations, including those of lower socioeconomic status,
people living with HIV, and young children living in low-resource settings. Malawi has seen a massive increase
in extreme weather events related to climate change in recent years, culminating in Cyclone Freddy, believed to
be the longest-lasting and highest force cyclone ever recorded, which hit Malawi on March 11th. Independent of
direct morbidity or mortality due to drowning or blunt injury, Cyclone Freddy may have severely impacted the
health of Malawian children through exposure to a broad range of infectious diseases, and increased
experiences of psychosocial adversities resulting in prolonged periods of toxic stress. We are currently following
a cohort of mothers (recruited in the third trimester of pregnancy) and infants being followed up to five years of
age in three categories: (1) children HIV exposed and uninfected (CHEU) born to women diagnosed with HIV at
the first antenatal visit, thus exposed to uncontrolled viremia for at least half of gestation; (2) CHEU born to
women initiated on ART prior to conception with undetectable viral loads; and (3) infants born to HIV uninfected
mothers. Our goal is to conduct rigorously validated longitudinal assessments of neurocognitive development
and biological and psychosocial factors which may play a role in child development. We are leading one of the
first studies of CHEU in resource-limited settings to simultaneously address the impact of biological and
psychosocial factors on neurocognitive development. In this supplement, we are planning to incorporate climate
change information into our assessment of the impact of maternal HIV infection and the post-natal environment
on long-term health and neurocognitive outcomes in children. Our evaluation will include assessing the impact
of Cyclone Freddy and other extreme weather events on neurocognitive development in HIV-exposed infants by
evaluating the impact of these factors on the family’s quality of life as reported by the mother and exposure to
vector-borne infections. We will test the following hypotheses: 1a: Cyclone Freddie will lead to increased rates
of maternal depression, increased severity of exposure to childhood adversity, and decreased quality of housing.
The impact will be greatest among mothers living with HIV. 1b: the neurocognitive development of infants in
households that report significant impacts of the cyclone is likely to be delayed compared to households which
do not report major impacts. 2a: Extreme weather events will lead to an increase in arboviral exposure, this effect
will be greatest among households with lower SES, CHEU, and mothers living with HIV. 2b: Exposure to
arboviruses will be associated with poorer neurocognitive scores at five years of age, particularly among CHEU.
This research will measure the impact of these climate-related factors on the health and well-being of HIV-
exposed compared to HIV-unexposed children. We hypothesize that climate change will have a disproportionate
impact on children born to mothers with HIV-infection and therefore will require additional interventions to
develop climate resiliency in childhood."

11013681,"Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a global health threat due to the widespread and expanding
geographical distribution of the tick vector, the absence of specific medical interventions for treatment and
prevention, and its rapid-onset hemorrhagic fever with a 10-50% case-fatality rate. It is the most geographically
widespread tickborne virus and the causative agent of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), one of the most
severe zoonotic viral diseases in humans. Undifferentiated febrile illness is among the most common reasons for
people seeking medical care in resource-limited countries, and CCHF is difficult to diagnose in its early pre-
hemorrhagic stages due to non-specific symptoms that can be associated with various febrile illnesses. To address
this, we developed PANDAA CCHFV—the first universal, pan-lineage CCHFV diagnostic to meet the WHO R&D
blueprint target product profile—during our SBIR Phase II. Aldatu’s pioneering PANDAA technology enables probe-
based qPCR for target detection in highly variable genomic regions by simultaneously adapting and amplifying
diverse viral variants. PANDAA uniquely mitigates the presence of genetic polymorphisms in viral variants to allow
the detection of otherwise divergent targets by fluorescent probes. As such, we are distinctly positioned to
commercialize the first rapid, sensitive molecular CCHFV diagnostic assay with pan-lineage coverage and superior
performance compared to existing diagnostics that won’t be affected by genetic changes in new viral variants.
Through these Phase IIB milestones, we will establish regulatory and quality frameworks for manufacturing and
commercializing PANDAA CCHFV as a rapid and sensitive molecular assay with superior performance to existing
diagnostics. We will expand our existing quality management system (QMS), which is compliant with international
standards for medical device manufacturing, to incorporate in-house cGMP manufacturing of PANDAA CCHFV. With
our evaluation partners, we will perform pre-commercialization studies in multiple high-priority markets to determine
performance using clinical samples from all CCHFV clades. This will generate the necessary data to submit PANDAA
CCHFV for CE certification as an in vitro diagnostic (IVD). This will be accompanied by implementing our initial go-
to-market strategy in 3-5 short list countries. We will have identified and vetted clinical study partners, distributors,
and other regional partners to support Aldatu in negotiations and contracting with local partners and facilitating
engagement with Ministries of Health. We will precede our go-to-market launch with early site evaluations by
collaborators in key target markets where they will perform concordance studies with existing CCHFV assays. The
net result will be the manufacturing and regulatory qualification of PANDAA CCHFV, which will provide a rapid,

11011221,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Extensive research has documented the physical and mental health benefits of social support, yet large swaths
of the population experience social disconnection and do not derive these benefits. Roughly 73% of adolescents
report they needed more emotional support than they received in the past year (1), and 39% of high school
seniors describe themselves as lonely (2). The prevalence of loneliness has increased during the COVID-19
pandemic (3, 4), further highlighting the importance of understanding this phenomenon. Why are so many
adolescents experiencing social disconnection? A key underlying process may be adolescents’ heightened
biological stress reactivity (5), which can profoundly affect their social behavior. Taylor (6) theorized that the
stress response can activate two primary social-behavioral profiles: (a) “fight-or-flight” (i.e., an increase in conflict
or social withdrawal) or (b) “tend-and-befriend” (i.e., an increase in prosocial and affiliative behavior). This theory
raises the possibility that the biological stress response activates behavioral repertoires that either increase
social disconnection or facilitate social connection after stress exposure. However, most prior research testing
Taylor’s model has been cross-sectional and with adults, creating a gap in our understanding of when and
why these profiles emerge in development. Adolescence is a key period during which average rates of loneliness
rise steeply, but we know little about why some youth respond to social challenges with socially distancing
behaviors whereas other youth respond by strengthening their social connections. This project aims to fill these
critical gaps by identifying the biological, personality, and relationship characteristics that differentiate these two
social-behavioral stress response profiles. We hypothesize a vicious cycle whereby some youth who experience
social disconnection will show heightened social-behavioral and physiological reactivity in response to social
evaluation or social exclusion, which fosters further social disconnection. At a biological level, we propose this
cycle is perpetuated by altered oxytocin, adrenocortical, autonomic, and inflammatory activity. We propose both
a new data collection effort and secondary analyses of a rich existing longitudinal dataset to test the two aims of
this project. This project will advance our understanding of the development of social disconnection in youth and
the biobehavioral targets that can be modified to increase social connectedness in adolescence and beyond."

11023934,"Project Summary/Abstract
 The bioactive lipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) plays a key role in regulating the growth, survival and
migration of mammalian cells. S1P is produced intracellularly and then released extracellularly to engage in its
(patho)physiological roles. The Spinster (Spns) lipid transporters of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) are
critical for transporting S1P across cellular membranes. Of the three Spns proteins in humans, Spns2 functions
as the main S1P transporter, which makes it a potential drug target for modulating S1P export and signaling. An
endothelial cell-specific defect in Spns2 results in impaired egress of lymphocytes and prevents tumor metastasis
in mice, strongly suggesting that Spns2 could be an effective target for reducing metastases by increasing the
efficacy of immunotherapy. Thus, detailed characterization of the Spns2 mechanism is of high significance for
the development of novel therapeutic strategies for diseases associated with S1P signaling and to target Spns2
as a potential immunosuppressant. The overall goal of this proposal is to define the functional mechanism of the
Spns family of sphingolipid transporters. The mechanism of Spns2-mediated S1P transport across cellular
membrane remains poorly understood, mainly due to the lack of structural information (Aims 1 and 2). In
addition, the precise mechanism of Spns2 regulation is still unclear (Aim 3). We recently defined the proton-
dependent conformational dynamics of a bacterial Spns transporter. Our approach capitalizes on a powerful
pulsed EPR technique known as Double Electron Electron Resonance (DEER) spectroscopy, an effective
nanometer-scale ruler, in the context of high-resolution structures. It is informed by functional studies and
contextualized through collaborative molecular modeling. Using this integrated approach, we conduct a thorough
mechanistic comparison between human Spns2 and its homologs. The objectives of this proposal are to define
the cation- and substrate-coupled conformational cycle of human Spns2 and its bacterial homologs in lipid
bilayers. To determine the conformational states involved in the alternating access mechanism, we will apply
DEER spectroscopy under conditions expected to stabilize transport intermediates and combine the results with
restraint-assisted molecular dynamics to map ligand-coupled conformational changes. Using a similar integrated
approach to define the transport mechanism of other Spns family members and their prokaryotic homologs, we
will identify the key commonalities and differences in their mechanisms, highlighting the mechanistic flexibility
enabling their diverse function with transformative therapeutic potential."

Violence disproportionately affects African American youth. In addition to death and injury, violence exposure
has significant psychological consequences, including traumatic stress symptoms and internalizing problems.
Self-directed violence has shown startling and disproportionate growth among African American youth, with
suicide rates nearly doubling from 2007 to 2018. Current prevention strategies have limited effectiveness,
perhaps due to their failure to address the causal role of structural racism in violence. The primary aim of this
proposed project is to examine the extent to which an intervention addressing structural racism in education
and law enforcement reduces interpersonal violence and suicide among middle school-aged youth, with a
focus on populations experiencing health disparities (African Americans; low-income communities). The
proposed project will examine community-level changes using a multiple baseline experimental design that
randomizes the start of the intervention in four communities, each comprising a police precinct and middle
school. The intervention will consist of (a) school-based intervention components including a culturally
responsive, community-inclusive adaptation of a whole-school climate intervention (School-wide Positive
Behavior Interventions and Supports), and culturally responsive practices training and coaching; (b) law
enforcement-based intervention components representing procedural justice interventions, including training in
disproportionate minority contact, and training and coaching on de-escalation with trauma-exposed youth; and
(c) an integrated community intervention that includes community-building between police officers, school
personnel, and youth through team-oriented contact. Outcomes will be measured using archival data from the
schools and police department as well as survey data from youth, school personnel, and police officers. Aim 1
is to evaluate the extent to which targeting structural and cultural racism reduces interpersonal violence among
youth, as measured by individual-level, school-level, and precinct-level data. Aim 2 is to evaluate the extent to
which targeting structural and cultural racism reduces suicidality among youth, as measured by completed
suicides and proximal precedents for suicide, including attempts and ideation. Aim 3 is to evaluate the extent
to which targeting structural and cultural racism reduces both overall rates and disproportionality of school-
based exclusionary discipline practices; increases culturally relevant pedagogy; and reduces both overall rates
and disproportionality of juvenile arrests and police use-of-force. Aim 4 is to evaluate specific intervention
components by determining their effects on hypothesized mechanisms of change at the individual, teacher,
school, and law enforcement levels. This intervention has the potential to reduce morbidity and mortality
among African American youth, promote overall quality of life, and reduce the societal costs associated with
both interpersonal violence and suicidality. Furthermore, effective strategies to address structural racism have
the potential to facilitate groundbreaking public health prevention of health disparities."
11020626,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The introduction of the integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) class of HIV drugs transformed the treatment
of persons with HIV (PWH), offering highly effective and well-tolerated options with fewer drug interactions.
However, concerns about INSTIs causing weight gain, particularly in women, have been raised in various studies.
Despite recent investigations, a definitive explanation for the mechanism behind INSTI-associated weight gain
remains elusive. Recently, we reported that the administration of dolutegravir led to an increase in fat mass and
body weight through suppression of thermogenic processes in a rodent model, which was associated with a
disruption of mitochondrial respiration and reduced expression of uncoupling protein1 (UCP1) in adipose tissues.
Moreover, other groups further confirmed these results using non-human primates (NHPs) infected with SIV.
Interestingly, it has been well-documented that estrogen plays a critical role in promoting thermogenic processes
through the peripheral and central nervous systems. Our preliminary data shows that dolutegravir inhibits
estrogen signaling action, and genetic deletion of estrogen receptors in adipocytes attenuates dolutegravir-
mediated suppression of the thermogenic process. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that
dolutegravir reduces energy expenditure via disrupting estrogen action in adipocytes, leading to the weight gain
associated with INSTIs. To further investigate this hypothesis, we will first define the molecular mechanisms by
which INSTI-based ART disrupts whole-body metabolism and leads to weight gain via the estrogen receptor (ER)
using a transgenic mouse model in which ER is genetically deleted in adipose tissues. We will perform
biochemical and molecular analyses combined with multi-omics approaches, including single-cell RNA and
ATAC-sequencing to further elucidate the molecular network associated with INSTI-related adipose function
disruption via ER (Aim 1). Next, to address the absence of a chronic retroviral infection in a murine model, we
will investigate how estrogen affects INSTI-based ART-mediated weight gain over time via disrupted
thermogenesis in NHPs infected with SIV and ovariectomized with or without estrogen replacement. We will also
perform temporal transcriptomic analyses on adipose tissues to gain a comprehensive understanding of how
these tissues are altered through infection, ART initiation, and E2 manipulation over time (Aim 2). Finally, we will
evaluate the effects of INSTI-based ART on thermogenic pathways and mitochondria functions in adipose tissue
at multiple time points from PWH starting INSTI-based treatment and followed for one year. Moreover, we will
perform integrative transcriptomics analyses utilizing cross-species omics data (Aim 3). These multidisciplinary
and translational works will shed light on how INSTIs contribute to weight gain, especially in females, and inform
the development of new strategies to reduce excess adiposity and metabolic dysfunction in PWH."
11009640,"Abstract. In response to NOT-AI-23-070, we propose to characterize, assess, and protocolize implementation
strategies that HIV organizations are using to improve the reach of PrEP and mental health/substance use
(MH/SU) treatments to Latino men who have sex with men (LMSM), and then build a platform to scale up
these strategies to other US Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) jurisdictions. Current reach of these services to
LMSM does not meet their needs, fueling HIV disparities; thus, relevant implementation strategies are urgently
needed. In an innovative yet underused approach that contrasts with traditional implementation research,
successful implementation strategies already used by HIV organizations will be scaled up and disseminated
through a “ground up” approach. With EHE grant support, our team formed SOMOS Alianza (San Juan,
Orlando, Miami Organizational Strategic Alliance), comprising community-based implementers and
researchers in EHE jurisdictions that are linked by high HIV incidence among LMSM, migration, and
geographic proximity. To improve reach to LMSM, SOMOS Alianza implementers use a variety of
implementation strategies that they consider to be successful, feasible, and culturally relevant for LMSM and
their organizations. These strategies may be more feasible and culturally relevant than those produced in
traditional research-to-practice approaches. We propose to leverage the infrastructure and trusted
collaborations inherent in SOMOS Alianza to rigorously characterize and identify strategies these organizations
use that align with the evidence base for implementation determinants and behavior change methods, using
innovative implementation science methods, including Rapid Assessment Procedure Informed Clinical
Ethnography and reverse implementation mapping. We will protocolize strategies that meet our inclusion
criteria and build an online Implementation Strategy Dashboard, following user-centered design, which we will
evaluate for usability and impact. Specific aims are 1. To characterize, assess, and protocolize the
implementation strategies currently used by SOMOS Alianza organizations to improve PrEP and MH/SU
treatment reach to LMSM. 2. To build a Dashboard of strategies that meet Aim 1 inclusion criteria for improving
the reach of PrEP and MH/SU treatment to LMSM. 3. To assess the Dashboard’s usability and associated
organizational outcomes in HIV organizations across US EHE jurisdictions. Completion of these aims will
address the suboptimal reach of PrEP and MH/SU treatments to LMSM by drawing primarily on implementer
expertise. Our innovative approach of scaling up implementation strategies from existing local practices in
regions where LMSM experience significant disparities disrupts traditional research-to-practice pathways and
is likely to have a powerful and sustained public health impact. Our findings will impact the field by 1)
identifying contextually appropriate and feasible implementation strategies and 2) developing and evaluating a
dashboard for scaling up the strategies in pursuit of achieving EHE goals among LMSM across the US."

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among the African American population. Although many
actionable biomarkers and targeted treatments are available to significantly prolong lung cancer survival, patients
of non-European ancestry are less likely to undergo next-generation sequencing testing than their white
counterparts. Our preliminary analysis based on real-world, observational data of clinical tumor sequencing show
that although patients with African ancestry are enriched in tobacco smoking-induced mutational processes,
there is an enrichment of TP53 and depletion of KRAS mutations, suggesting that African ancestry may modify
smoking exposure on developing KRAS-mutant lung cancer. Moreover, there is a significant enrichment of high
tumor mutation burden, which is a biomarker for immune checkpoint inhibitors, independent of smoking status.
In this project, we will identify germline ancestry or race-specific environmental/social factors influencing the
tumor genome of lung cancers. We will also assess the joint effect of African ancestry and smoking, on somatic
mutations and tumor-immune features. We will perform immune profiling on immunotherapy -treated patients of
African ancestry. We will assess the inflammatory mediators from plasma samples of patients of African ancestry
and understand how different factors in innate response may impact patient’s immunotherapy outcome.
The proposed study will broaden our knowledge about the complex relationship between genetic ancestry,
environmental exposure and immune interaction contributing to genomic differences. The findings will improve
lung cancer diagnostic testing and immunotherapy outcome prediction, and lead to future study and discovery
of new treatment options for African American patients. Relevance. There is a significant racial disparity in lung
cancer. In this proposal, we will identify and characterize somatic biomarkers in tumors from patients of African
ancestry. These studies will improve clinical genomic testing and uncover therapeutic targets for this patient

11012028,"Obesity disparities among American Indian (AI) youth exist and, to date, there are limited interventions
available to successfully address weight and consequential outcomes for AI youth. The high prevalence of
youth-based obesity is alarming, placing them at disproportionate risk for adult obesity and obesity-driven
metabolic diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, and stroke. In addition,
although cancer has traditionally been considered a distinct spectrum of disease, increasing evidence supports
the importance of metabolic disturbances in the cause of cancer. This underscores the urgent need to
address excess weight in AI youth to protect against obesity-related diseases, including cancers, in
later life. Schools provide concentrated time with students, provide up to 50% of daily food intake, provide
physical activity opportunities, and teach health education. Tribal schools participating in the federal school
meal programs are required to adopt and implement a School Wellness Policy (SWP) that sets clear
expectations for nutrition education, foods served and sold, physical activity and physical education practices.
Despite widespread research on the implementation of SWPs in U.S. schools, their generalizability to
schools in tribal communities remains limited, highlighting a major gap in understanding how tribal
schools adopt and implement SWPs. The goal of P2 is to engage and partner with 3 separate tribal schools
on Navajo Nation. The objectives are to implement an established health promotion curricula among 4th
graders after completing formative research to strengthen SWPs at each school, to establish a baseline for
each school. We will use a train-the-trainer approach to establish structured lessons and practices, as
warranted, for physical education instructors and food service personnel, for example. The health promotion
curricula for the students will include culturally tailored health education focused on nutrition and physical
activity. We hypothesize that participation in our health promotion efforts will strengthen school-specific
SWPs, including structured physical activity, and that 4th grade youth will increase their knowledge and exhibit
improved behaviors for fruits and vegetables consumption and increased physical activity.
 Specific Aim 1 – Complete formative assessments at three K-8 Navajo Nation tribal schools to understand
the capacity and resources of each to implement a train-the-trainer approach to establish structured lessons
and practices, as warranted, for physical education instructors and food service personnel.
 Specific Aim 2 – Assess changes in the knowledge and behaviors of Navajo youth exposed to a culturally
appropriate health promotion curriculum during the academic school year. Changes in fruits and vegetables
consumption and physical activity will be compared between 4th graders to 3rd graders.
 Specific Aim 3 – Assess changes in SWPs at each participating school using the Wellness School
Assessment Tool from baseline to post-interventions."

Fundamental unanswered questions in the field of alcohol research include: why do only a subset of individuals
with an alcohol-use disorder develop clinically significant organ damage and what factors predispose subjects
with AUD to develop organ failure in a specific organ? Studies provide compelling evidence to support the
hypothesis that disruption of circadian homeostasis is a plausible susceptibility factor for host and organ-specific
vulnerability to alcohol-induced pathologies. Interest in the study of circadian rhythms is growing; however, an
obstacle to study the interactions between circadian rhythms and alcohol-induced organ damage has been the
lack of a combined circadian rhythm and alcohol expertise (and the underlying molecular mechanisms) and the
high cost associated with establishing the infrastructure necessary to assess and manipulate circadian rhythms.
The objective of this R24 Alcohol Research Resource Program “Center for Circadian Rhythms and Alcohol-
Induced Tissue Damage” is to fill these unmet needs. The objective of Phase I (current funding period) of this
Center focused on advancing awareness of the topic and availability of Center resources, providing resources
and support to investigators, as well as training and mentoring of junior investigators. With NIAAA-support we
provided services to nearly 60 investigators resulting in 23 publications, provided support for 28 grant
applications (5 funded), and training / mentoring of 13 junior investigators. The objective of this competitive
renewal (Phase II) is to build on Phase I success by continuing to provide the infrastructure, support, and
expertise to enable to conduct research on the topic of alcohol and circadian rhythms. Additionally, in response
to requests from users we will provide additional resources for mechanistic evaluations to evaluate the
relationship between alcohol and circadian rhythms including microbiota, intestinal barrier, and intestinal-derived
inflammation. These objectives will be attained by pursuing the following Aims. Aim 1. Promote awareness of
the topic and the opportunity to incorporate circadian rhythms, microbiota, and gut-derived inflammation into
mechanistic, therapeutic, and translational alcohol research studies. Contribution to the Community: Increased
awareness of circadian rhythms in alcohol research (and mechanisms) and venues to support dialogue and
collaborations to be a springboard for innovative research. Aim 2. Provide the essential resources to incorporate
circadian rhythms in alcohol research for human and animal studies as well as mechanistic evaluations of
microbiota and gut-derived inflammation. Contribution to the Community: Give researchers the skills and
resources to test innovative hypotheses. In summary, continuation of this R24 Center will engage and provide
researchers with the skills, resources, and assistance to explore innovative hypotheses, and bring new
investigators into the field of alcohol research including junior faculty and trainees. These efforts are expected to
lead to the identification of novel targets and interventions to prevent and treat alcohol-induced organ damage
now and in the years to come."

Basic research opens the door to better understand, treat, and ultimately prevent existing and
emerging public health threats. NIAID has prioritized fundamental research into underpinnings of
the HIV-associated chronic immune activation despite the control of viral load by daily
antiretroviral medication. Recent findings of the HIV-1 RNA cap hyper methylation reveal a new
paradigm of viral RNA regulation that finely tunes viral gene expression for adaptive and sustained
virus replication in host immune cells. Revealing preliminary research on a new generation of HIV
drug, which compromises replication of HIV clinical isolates without positive selection for drug
resistance, has exposed inhibition of host TGS1 hypermethylation of HIV-1 m7G-Cap on RRE-
containing RNAs, thus establishing this small molecule will be a powerful molecular probe to
investigate the molecular interactions that regulate HIV cap hypermethylation. The HIV intron-
containing (ic)RNA, which contains RRE, has been reported to trigger innate immune signaling in
myeloid cells, and the communications induce T cell markers of exhaustion. Preliminary data posit
the hypothesis icRNA is distinguished by its TMG-Cap, which hosts use to alleviate excessive
innate immune signaling. However, it remains poorly understood how the Rev/RRE on the 3’- of
viral RNA participates in the cap hyper methylation on the 5’- end. Now, by integrating ample
preliminary cryoEM studies, HIV RNA-protein co-precipitations, and documentation of the
specialized translation pathway licensed by the hypermethylated HIV-1 m7G-Cap, we propose an
innovative and breakthrough model that explains previous controversial observations and unclear
mechanism of Rev/RRE functionality at the 5’-end of HIV-1 RNA and in translation control.
Specifically, host RNA helicase A (RHA) homo-dimerizes upon binding cognate RNA structures
in the HIV-1 RNA through bipartite arrangement that tethers Rev/RRE in proximity to nuclear cap
binding complex. Interdisciplinary tools are employed to delve into the basic science of the HIV
TMG-Cap pathway linked to Rev/RRE. Our preliminary results posit that dysregulating the TMG-
Cap pathway triggers host innate immune signaling leading to outcomes that are advantageous
for the host. The overarching project goal is to define the structural basis of the HIV cap
hypermethylation regulation for viral post-transcriptional control of gene expression and define its
linkage with HIV’s ability to modulate host innate immune signaling. At the project completion, the
new information is expected to arm scientists for developing next-wave treatments to neutralize
deleterious immune signaling in HIV-immune cell environments."

transformative, cutting-edge biomedical research addressing health disparities in our population.
As a Hispanic-serving institution, we are committed to training, supporting, motivating, and
incentivizing investigators in developing research projects addressing minority health disparities.
This project will prioritize research studies on women, youth, and children's health and health
equity in conditions such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, inflammation, infectious diseases,
violence, and trauma. The new SJB Biomedical Research Center for Hispanic Health
Disparities (SJB BioReC) will significantly enhance the research endeavors of SJB
investigators, collaborators, and students by providing a unique set of capabilities currently
unavailable. The SJB BioRec will be a central component of the SJB Research Center for
accomplishing the following four objectives: 1) meet the current and projected future research
demand, 2) enable faculty, students, and collaborators to develop research expertise in
addressing health disparities, 3) enhance institution-wide research programs, including the
creation of a Ph.D., and 4) increase the number of students entering research interdisciplinary
programs. The primary approach for achieving these objectives is constructing new biomedical
research facilities on a 1.7-acre parcel of land owned by SJB contiguous to the Institution's
current facilities. The single-level building will include 2 Core Labs, 2 Cell Culture Rooms, a
Sample Collection and Preparation Room, a Data Analysis, Shared Equipment, Group
Discussion and Dark Rooms, and an Autoclave Room, among other facilities. Integrating
modern laboratory spaces, research training, and capacity-building programs will help meet the
growing needs of SJB investigators and students. The expanded research infrastructure will
boost the capabilities to obtain data to submit proposals to competitive external grant
opportunities and become partners in multi-institutional research grant projects. The project will
also benefit researchers outside the Institution by providing a valuable hub in Caguas, Puerto
Rico (easily accessible from all areas of the Island) for biomedical, clinical, and translational
research. In addition, this facility will benefit local researchers in under-resourced communities
and serve a broad research community as we seek to advance research addressing health
disparities among Hispanic populations. Therefore, the new SJB BioReC will significantly
enhance the research capacity at the Institution and promote internal and external scientific
collaborations."

Nalu Scientific LLC (NSL) proposes to develop and optimize the design of a silicon photomultiplier (SiPM)
based, low-power, high channel density, waveform-digitizing readout microchip for TOF-PET that will increase
image quality and provide more accurate and precise quantization, with the potential to significantly improve
early diagnosis or lower exposure while also allowing greater flexibility in the development of personalized
patient imaging strategies. The key idea behind the project is that of using the information of the full waveform
acquired from the sensors that can provide information to overcome the limitations of traditional approaches,
like the very fine accuracy in the threshold definition, dependence on low and high frequency noise, necessity
of ad-hoc corrections for waveform amplitude (“time-walk”) and shape variation, and imprecise energy
information, as well as no information about depth of interaction.
NSL’s patented waveform-digitizing “System on Chip” readout ASIC technology has the potential to
substantially improve TOF-PET imaging from its current state. During Phase I, we developed analytic modeling
of light production and transport in scintillating crystals, along with realistic simulations of sensor and readout
electronics in order to derive baseline technical specifications for a WFD readout chip. We then implemented a
machine learning model to harvest and demonstrate the benefits of WFD. In phase II, we will complete the
design, fabricate and test a SiPM-based, low-power, high channel density, waveform-digitizing readout
microchip for TOF-PET, and validate the concept by developing and testing a PET subsystem as a
demonstrator. We will collaborate with Dr. Hamid Sabet (Harvard) in improving the modeling of phase I,
defining the advantages and limitations of the use of waveform information in a full PET system setting, and
implementing a flat-panel PET detector demonstrator. The project specific aims are 1: Design and Fabricate
Waveform digitizer chip for PET applications. 2: Design and Fabricate a DAQ system for PET incorporating the
WFD readout chip. 3: WFD-based Detector Assembly Integration and characterization.
In Phase II, in order to reach the specific aims, we will complete the design of the prototype chip following the
specifications derived in phase I, using state of the art tools to confirm the functionality and performance of the
chip before fabrication and verifying it with thorough testing. We then will fabricate a DAQ system capable of
synchronizing multiple copies of the readout chip and handling expected data rates from realistic TOF-PET
detector environments, and finally evaluate them in a realistic condition using phantom testing.
The successful completion of the work is expected to result in the definition of a novel readout device and
system that could prove transformative for the field of next generation PET scanners."

People who present with Acquire Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) are at high risk of developing an
opportunistic infection and death. Opportunistic infections (OIs) are any infection that is more frequent or more
severe because of HIV-mediated immunosuppression. Different states in the United States (US) have varying
rates of deaths among people with HIV (PWH) and AIDS due to variable health insurance coverage rates,
demographic health disparities, and access to health care. Data science public health tools to predict disease
and poor outcomes are rapidly advancing, but have not yet been sufficiently applied to improve outcomes
among PWH. In this K08 Mentored Career Development Award, Dr. Catherine Bielick, a fellow physician in
Infectious Diseases at the University of Virginia and rising data scientist, proposes to use artificial intelligence
(AI) to 1) predict the change in OI hospitalization rates by simulating Medicaid expansion (ME) in the South
and identify associated health inequities, 2) predict the change in OI-related mortality rates by simulating ME
and identify associated health inequities, and 3) create a time-series machine learning model to predict poor
clinical outcomes for individual PWH. The first two aims will be accomplished using the State Inpatient
Database (SID), which is hospitalization-level data for over 97% of hospitals in the US. The South was chosen
based on preliminary data finding an association with OI hospitalizations, mortality, and being uninsured.
Demographics, diagnosis codes with presence on admission indicators, and hospital information will all be
used to simulate the effect of Medicaid expansion in each state and predict the change in OI hospitalization
and mortality rates for PWH. The measured impact of this simulated intervention will provide important
groundwork to inform progress on state-level social determinants of health (SDOH), the need for health
insurance for all PWH, and future cost-effectiveness analyses. The last aim will use multisite longitudinal
electronic medical record (EMR) data called the ADVANCE network consisting entirely of underrepresented
patient populations from whom this subset of PWH will be the focus. A time-series deep learning model will be
used to create a risk score for individual PWH which predicts loss of viral suppression, development of an OI,
or all-cause mortality in the following 6 months. Accomplishing this goal will produce a foundational tool on
which future machine learning models can optimize model generalizability, safety, privacy, and responsible
implementation in an EMR for real-time predictions made at an intervenable time. This proposal benefits from a
strong advisory team which includes leading experts in HIV health and policy, data analytics, machine learning,
biostatistics, PWH data use, and AI health care. Drawing from the mentorship, collaboration, and support from
the Division of Infectious Disease, Public Health Sciences, the McManus lab, and the UVA School of Data
Science, the University of Virginia is an ideal institution for this award and provide the resources and diverse
environment for Dr. Bielick to flourish as an independent investigator in this cutting-edge field."

Due to the widespread use of antiretroviral therapy, HIV replication is effectively controlled in infected individuals.
However, viral reservoirs form early post-infection, posing a persistent challenge to complete virus eradication.
It has been suggested that sex differences may influence the establishment of HIV reservoirs, with variations
between women and men attributed to socio-economic and biological factors, a phenomenon further
compounded by opioid use. Established knowledge indicates that women are more susceptible to HIV acquisition
than men due to robust estrogen receptor signaling. Despite this, women tend to exhibit lower viral loads and
more robust antiviral responses than men, potentially contributing to differences in the size of viral reservoirs.
Moreover, opioid abuse remains a significant problem among HIV-infected individuals, with common opioids like
morphine implicated in differentially augmenting SIV/HIV persistence within the Central Nervous System (CNS)
and periphery. The overarching goal of this proposal is to explore the role of sex differences in the establishment
and maintenance of HIV/SIV reservoirs in the context of substance use. Preliminary studies using SIV-infected
rhesus macaques as a model of HIV infection demonstrate that chronic use of morphine modulates SIV
reservoirs differentially. Higher reservoir sizes are observed in CNS-derived microglial cells compared to
peripheral PBMC and lymph nodes in animals exposed to morphine, as opposed to control animals. However,
systematic studies are needed to document these differences comprehensively. To address this question, we
plan to utilize age/sex-matched rhesus macaques and unique reagents prepared in our laboratory. This involves
employing a well-established model of the SIVmac251 virus, which has been previously used to generate
preliminary data, demonstrating efficient replication in both the CNS and periphery. The proposed research aims
to delineate the role of sex factors in seeding and establishing viral reservoirs (Aim 1). Subsequently, we will
determine the location, abundance, and persistence of viral reservoirs in the context of opioid dependence.
Modeling simulations will be performed to understand the differences between establishing reservoirs in males
and females (Aim 2). These studies are expected to reveal whether sex differences play a significant role in
establishing reservoirs in people living with HIV infection (PLWH) in the setting of opioid usage. This information
will be valuable for designing effective HIV cure strategies."

South Africa continues to shoulder the highest burden of people living with HIV (PLHIV) in the world. In an
effort to minimize the national burden of the HIV epidemic, South Africa has been at the forefront of adopting
biomedical prevention. Still there is work to be done, as key populations (vulnerable patients, young men and
women) are still not accessing lifesaving preventative and therapeutic HIV services. The ED provides care to
high volumes of adults who may not otherwise interact with the health system, and thus is an important testing
and linkage to care venue. A Universal Test-and-Connect (UTC) strategy promotes access to both
preventative (pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis) and therapeutic (ART initiation) HIV services from the ED. It
can expand care to otherwise missed populations and aligns directly with a differentiated service delivery
model that is integrated within existing, sustainable service delivery venues. This status neutral approach has
the ability to normalize HIV services in a venue that is untouched but shows great promise.
The goal of this R34 proposal is to integrate UTC in two high volume EDs (one a high-volume tertiary care
trauma center and another a high-volume district level facility) in Cape Town, South Africa. We first aim to
integrate HIV assessment over a period of one year into routine care to define the prevalence and key
characteristics of ED patients eligible for UTC interventions (Aim 1). We then seek to pilot (N=100) the delivery
of oral and long-acting pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to ED patients (Aim 2). This has never been trialed
before in the ED context in South Africa, and we seek to determine the preliminary uptake of PrEP (oral and
long acting) in ED patients, as well as PrEP continuation at six weeks. Lastly, we propose to determine the
operational feasibility of UTC using value stream mapping to map patients journeys in the ED and determine
healthcare worker acceptability using the normalization process theory framework to guide physician and
nursing surveys (N=160) and in-depth interviews (N=40).
This new collaboration between Johns Hopkins University and the Desmond Tutu HIV Foundation brings
together our complementary expertise in ED-based HIV service delivery and action research to reach missed
populations. Together we seek to deliver the ED as an untapped partner in the fight against HIV, so that all
populations can access life changing preventative and therapeutic HIV services."

Construction of infectious and pathogenic HIV-1, or HSIV -- an essentially HIV-1 backbone having minimal SIV
gene fragments -- for the simian model will bring tremendous value to studies of AIDS pathogenesis and to
vaccine and therapeutic reagents. Our preliminary data and previous findings on SHIV demonstrate that not
the Env and receptor/co-receptor molecules, but the inability of the entered HIV-1 to activate the initially resting
lymphocytes is the major culprit for the restriction of HIV-1 replication in monkey cells. Nef of SIVpbj1.9
(SNef), but not HIV-1, can sufficiently activate T cells such that the entered SIVpbj1.9 replicates robustly in the
resting T cells, causing the infected monkey to die of AIDS within a few weeks. We accordingly constructed
chimeric nef, HSNef, which harbors the 5’ 309 nucleotides (nts) of SIVpbj1.9 nef in place of the 5’ 221 nts of
HIV-1 nef, non-overlapping region with the long terminal repeat (LTR), and first tested whether the recombinant
Nef can activate T cells. Our data showed that HSNef itself sufficiently activated resting T cells, manifested by
IL2 generation and Nef-triggered IL2-promoter activity, while HIV-1 Nef (HNef) did not. Further, remarkably,
infection of HSIVnef -- which harbors all functional HIV-1 genes, except a small fragment of the SIVpbj1.9 nef,
HSNef, within an HIV-1 provirus -- into resting human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMC) integrated
its provirus into host chromosomes without mitogenic activation and thereby replicated in the initially resting
hPBMC, whereas HIV-1 could not. These data demonstrated that the small fragment of SIVpbj1.9 nef in HIV-1
backbone was sufficient for replication of the entered HIV-1. Moreover, consistent with the SHIV replication
studies in monkeys, HSIVnef comprising HIV-1 Env replicated robustly in activated monkey PBMC (mPBMC),
again confirming that Env is not a restriction factor for HIV-1 entry into simian host. These data fundamentally
illuminate the molecular function of Nef in pathogenicity for development of the HIV-1/simian AIDS model."

Project: Despite advances in HIV treatment programs, marginalized groups, including mobile men, continue to
struggle to remain in care. Mobility is associated with worse antiretroviral treatment (ART) retention and viral
suppression throughout sub-Saharan Africa. However, mobility is an essential livelihood strategy for many men
living with HIV (MLHIV). In the ReMIT study (“Reducing Mobility-associated Interruption in Treatment among
Men in Malawi”), we will refine and pilot an intervention to improve ART outcomes among mobile MLHIV in
Malawi. In Aim 1, we will use qualitative data from MLHIV, healthcare workers, and a community advisory
board to refine an intervention including multi-month dispensing, a hotline for mobile MLHIV, and mobility-
specific counseling. In Aim 2, we will conduct a pilot cluster randomized control trial at 6 health facilities with
240 mobile male ART clients (n=120 per arm) to test the intervention refined in Aim 1. Outcomes include a
preliminary estimate of the intervention’s effectiveness on ART retention (6-month retention - primary outcome)
and acceptability and feasibility of the intervention. Results of the pilot will inform a future, definitive trial.
Candidate background: I am trained as a physician and board certified in Internal Medicine & Pediatrics and
am transitioning to a career in global health research. In addition to my medical degree, I have a master’s in
public administration in international development (MPA/ID) and have worked in Malawi, Mozambique, and
Kenya. Career goals: My long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator with expertise in
health system interventions to improve access to care among vulnerable populations in sub-Saharan Africa.
Career development plan: The proposed K01 award will provide protected time, practical experience, and
training resources to develop my skills in (1) health systems interventions, (2) mobile populations, (3) trial
design and analysis, and (4) ethics in global health research and decolonizing global health. Environment:
The study will be conducted as part of an ongoing collaboration between the University of California Los
Angeles (UCLA) and Partners in Hope (PIH), a medical and research organization, based in Malawi. PIH is the
prime awardee on a US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) grant to support 123 health
facilities throughout Malawi, providing staff mentorship and capacity building, treatment and care, and

Many cells can travel from one place to another. This nomadic cell behavior is harnessed to form organs, seal
wounds, and hunt down pathogens, but it is often dysregulated in human diseases, including cancer.
Consequently, understanding the molecular basis of cell movement has widespread significance for human
health. Decades of cell migration studies have outlined how a cell moves on a flat surface. In a two-dimensional
environment, a moving cell extends a branched actin-filled protrusion in the direction of movement, while
actomyosin contractility retracts the rear. However, cells can move without actin-filled protrusions in vivo using
a poorly understood, three-dimensional migration mode called amoeboid migration. Amoeboid migrating cells
can move by extruding pressure-filled blebs devoid of actin or rapidly migrate with a near-constant spherical
shape using cortical actin flow. Cortical flow-driven amoeboid migration is commonly referred to as fast amoeboid
migration (FAM) and is induced by mechanical confinement in a wide variety of cells, with an increased
propensity in invasive cancer cells. The non-genetic and extensive induction of FAM, coupled with its use by
cancer cells in vivo, necessitates a mechanistic understanding of its underpinnings. However, observing and
perturbing FAM is technically challenging in vivo, and the plasticity with which cells can switch how they migrate
can confound subsequent analysis. My lab uses the developmental migration of Drosophila primordial germ cells
(PGCs) as a facile, reproducible system to study FAM. PGCs natively use FAM in vivo and, importantly, maintain
the characteristic cortical actin flows that power FAM outside of the embryo in culture without mechanochemical
inputs. Thus, PGCs do not alter how they move, even in a foreign two-dimensional environment. Over the next
five years, we will capitalize on the inflexible nature of migratory PGCs to deconstruct FAM and address several
outstanding, currently intractable questions: (1) What cortical actin architectures are permissive for cortical flows,
and how are these networks assembled, regulated, and maintained? (2) How are cortical flows oriented by
guidance cues to direct FAM? (3) How are cortical flows transmitted to a given substrate to generate traction for
productive motility? Results from this study will shed light on a poorly understood cell migration strategy and will
identify key factors to not only halt it for therapeutic intervention but also endow other cells with its use for cell-
based therapies."

The field of drug delivery to the inner ear is facing a disaster. Otonomy, the most prominent company that led
the field for over 10 years, declared bankruptcy following clinical trial failures of multiple therapeutics.
Frequency Therapeutics, a second powerhouse, shut down all ear research after clinical trial failures of their
FX322 hearing restoration therapy. In the light of these failures, it has become appreciated that drug delivery
to the inner ear faces serious technical challenges. One of the primary tenets in pharmacotherapy is that the
applied drug must reach the target tissue to exert therapeutic effects. Many small molecules, which enter the
ear easily following local applications, readily leak from perilymph and do not distribute well along the length of
the cochlea. The limited distribution has been well characterized in guinea pigs. Computer simulations further
suggest that restricted drug distribution becomes a proportionately greater problem for the longer, human
cochlea. However, computer simulations alone carry little credence without supporting experimental
data. The failure of drugs to reach the intended target tissues needs to be clearly demonstrated by credible
measurements. We believe that the recent therapy failures could have been avoided if a well-studied
large animal model of the inner ear had been available. For the small molecules used in several
formulations (dexamethasone in Otonomy’s Otividex; gacyclidine in Otonomy’s OTO-313; Valproate in
Frequency Therapeutic’s FX322) confirmation of the inability to deliver drug to mid and apical regions of the
cochlea in a large animal model would have driven searches for alternative therapeutics with more suitable
pharmacokinetic properties. Today, we still have many biotech companies (some of which work with Turner
Scientific) developing therapeutics for the ear without a large animal model to evaluate the PK properties of
their formulations. Drugs that may not distribute along larger cochleas are still being pursued. It is imperative
to know when a therapeutic for hearing fails to reach the mid and apical regions of the cochlea. Without
supporting or opposing measurements, valuable research resources from both private investments and
federal grants will be squandered pursuing the development of “no hope” drugs towards failed clinical trials.
Turner Scientific will provide the hearing research community with the minipig as a large animal model for
drug pharmacokinetics and for implantable device development of the inner ear. But to accomplish this it
needs support collecting the baseline data which are required to establish the model in the field. Standard
measures for assessing drug efficacy and safety, including pharmacokinetic measurements, ABRs, DPOAEs,
and hair cell quantification will be validated in normal and noise-damaged mini pigs, furthering their utility in
preclinical studies. In the long-term, this investment will save years of time and resources, avoiding wasteful
research spending and perhaps preventing additional bankruptcies of those companies remaining in the
hearing therapy field."

The primary objective of the proposal is to identify the initial regions in the brain affected by Alzheimer's
disease (AD), focusing on the entorhinal cortex (EC) and locus coeruleus (LC). These areas are known to
accumulate tau pathology, leading to cognitive impairment. The researchers plan to use advanced techniques
to record the electrophysiological properties of EC and LC neurons in App knockin mice, aiming to understand
how pathology contributes to neuronal dysfunction, sleep disruption, and memory impairment. They also intend
to use new tools for visualizing gene expression in intact tissue using spatial transcriptomics, specifically 10X
Visium technology, to study transcriptomic changes in these vulnerable brain regions.
The proposal includes two specific aims: Aim 1 involves the transcriptomic analysis of the LC region in AD
mice, with the goal of understanding how tauopathy affects the electrophysiological properties of the LC and
downstream regions. The researchers expect to see changes in genes related to novelty response, arousal,
and sleep. Aim 2 focuses on the transcriptomic analysis of the MEC region in AD mice, aiming to understand
how amyloid beta and tau pathology change gene expression in the MEC. The researchers anticipate changes
in genes involved in maintaining memory processes. These aims will provide valuable transcriptomic profiling
of the two vulnerable brain regions, significantly benefiting the parent proposal."

As the population ages, Latinx communities, families, and healthcare systems will be confronted by the
growing crisis of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). Identifying factors that confer resilience
to ADRD among aging Latinx communities is of critical importance to successfully reduce disparities. Some
studies find that bilinguals are at reduced AD risk compared to monolinguals, but other studies do not find
evidence of a bilingual advantage. Little attention has been given to within-group differences among bilinguals,
such as age of second language (L2) acquisition, proficiency, and frequency of language use, and how these
differences 1) are related to cognitive function in older age, 2) if they buffer the effects of neuropathology on
cognitive decline, and 3) how cognitive decline in AD can influence language use among bilinguals.
Determination of the aspects of bilingualism that confer resilience to AD could lead to novel interventions to
mitigate cognitive aging and ADRD disparities. The overall aim of this proposed research is to determine
whether aspects of bilingualism, including age of acquisition, language use, and proficiency, buffer the effects
of neuroimaging markers of pathology (i.e., AD biomarkers and cerebrovascular disease) on cognition and
cognitive decline within middle- and older-aged Latinx adults. The central hypothesis is that early age of L2
acquisition, greater daily use of both L1 and L2, and greater L2 proficiency will confer cognitive reserve,
independent of confounding sociocultural factors (i.e., education, socioeconomic status, immigration). Aims 1a
and 1b (K99) focus on identifying which aspects of bilingualism are associated with cognition and which
moderate the relationship between imaging markers and cognition. Aims 2a and 2b (R00) proposes to
determine the relationship between bilingualism and imaging markers on cognitive decline and determine
whether change in cognitive status is associated with changes in bilingualism. The proposed study will
harmonize data from Latinx adults currently enrolled in three longitudinal cohorts with available amyloid and
tau PET, MRI, and cognitive assessments: the Offspring study and the Washington Heights-Inwood Columbia
Aging Project at Columbia University, and the University of California-Davis Diversity Aging Cohort. To
accomplish these goals, the applicant will build on his strengths in cultural neuropsychology, health disparities,
and statistical methods by obtaining training during the K99 phase on 1) expanding knowledge of the cognitive
neuroscience and psycholinguistics of bilingualism; 2) modeling neuroimaging data; 3) the operationalization
and measurement of resilience among aging Latinx populations; and 4) enhancing statistical methods focused
on data harmonization, casual inference methods and latent variable modeling. This K99/R00 proposal lays the
foundation for an independent research career focused on mechanisms underlying the protective factors of
bilingualism and biculturalism in cognitive aging in a diverse population."

Small molecule and protein signals provide a rich vocabulary for cellular communication. The production and
consequences of these signals are exquisitely sensitive to cellular context and microenvironment. Dissecting the
molecular dialogue between cell types is challenging, and new methods are required to address fundamental
questions: What is the downstream biological function of each signaling molecule? How is the biological function
different when molecules are present in mixtures or when different cell types are present in the
microenvironment? How do microbes—like the bacteria and fungi present in our bodies—affect the molecular
landscape? Our lab is developing new tools to probe these questions including (1) microscale co- and
multiculture methods that enable precise positioning of cell types to study cell signaling, (2) specialized culture
platforms for complex human-bacteria-fungal multikingdom culture, (3) integration of microbial co- and
multiculture systems with volatile organic compound (VOC) sampling to study how volatiles mediate microbial
dialogue, and (4) at-home biofluid sampling and stabilization platforms to probe the human immune response
over time. The parent R35 award has three stated goals: 1) Develop novel microscale co- and multi-culture
platforms to study soluble factor signaling and use these tools to elucidate paracrine signaling mechanisms. 2)
Develop and validate new readouts for inflammation (e.g., fibrosis, vasodilation) and apply these methods to
identify key effector molecules and signaling pathways in inflammation. 3) Develop new analytical methods to
stabilize, isolate, and study inflammatory signals. Under the parent R35 award Goal 3, we developed a novel
platform that enables at-home blood sampling and RNA stabilization, homeRNA. The homeRNA kit contains a
commercially available at-home blood collection device and a custom ‘stabilizer tube’ that our lab engineered to
contain a stabilizing solution (e.g., RNAlater to stabilize RNA in blood). Importantly, homeRNA enables
longitudinal studies within an individual to capture temporal changes in gene expression signatures resulting
from exposures, disease flares, or in response to treatment. homeRNA enables evaluation of mechanistic
hypotheses in human populations, providing a complement to our lab’s in vitro microfluidic platforms, which use
cell lines or primary cells. In this supplement, my lab will build on our prior U3 Research Supplement (awarded
in 2022, prior to renewal of the parent R35 grant), where we established a cohort of U3 women (n=39) who used
homeRNA to sample themselves at home during an active COVID-19 infection. We will conduct surveys and
interviews to better understand their experiences in the study, ways that future studies can be improved to
facilitate inclusion of diverse populations, and ways that remote/telemedicine can increase access to healthcare
for U3 women. We will also analyze the samples collected to evaluate RNA integrity and yield for future
transcriptomics research."

relate to participation. The central hypothesis—that CRHDs are underrepresented (losing research benefit) and
overrepresented (risking exploitation) in others and that modifiable factors are the primary drivers of differential
study enrollment—will be evaluated in a mixed-methods study with 3 interrelated but distinct aims: Aim 1: To
prospectively characterize enrollment by CRHDs in pediatric ECC research and to identify factors associated
with enrollment and retention. Aim 2: To elucidate qualitative insights into modifiable and non-modifiable
factors impacting enrollment/retention in pediatric ECC research. Aim 3: To determine which factors are most
associated with successful enrollment of CRHDs. To date, Dr. Paquette has completed the enrollment and
analysis of Aim 1 and completed parent interviews for Aim 2. The proposed administrative supplement will
support qualitative methods team members with expertise in subject interviews, qualitative analysis, data
management to perform interviews of study staff members for completion of Aim 2 and development of the
parent survey for Aim 3. The supplement will also allow for qualitative and quantitative analyses necessary to
complete Aim 2 and Aim 3. The Aim 2 and 3 data will provide important information for development of a
recruitment/retention toolkit to be supported through an anticipated R21 mechanism and a subsequent R01 to
evaluate this intervention in a multisite trial. These funds for qualitative and quantitative methods experts will
enable Dr. Paquette to focus on those tasks necessary to maintain scientific productivity, such as completing
data analyses, writing scientific manuscripts, disseminating findings to scientific audiences, and drafting an
R21 application."
11024779,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
A key goal of biophysics is to predict the behavior of living systems. This goal is hampered by the fact that, when
examined at the single-cell level, this behavior appears largely unpredictable: Genetically identical cells, within
a uniform environment, exhibit heterogeneous phenotypes in terms of gene expression, signaling, and
consequent fate choice. This cellular individuality is observed throughout biology, from the emergence of
antibiotic resistance among bacteria, to cell differentiation in the early mammalian embryo, and numerous other
examples.
Studies over the last two decades have pinpointed the stochastic origins of cellular individuality, by
demonstrating that the inherent randomness (“noise”) of single-molecule events can be amplified into protein
number fluctuations at the cellular level. The picture that emerged from those studies is of living cells as “noisy
machines”, incapable of high precision, whose fate choices are subject to significant randomness. But the
widespread success of the “noise” concept in describing cellular heterogeneity also points to its weakness: It is
easy to describe single-cell properties as “stochastic” and map them into statistical distributions, but doing so
does not mean that we understand the underlying cellular process. On the contrary, by creating a façade of
understanding, a stochastic description may impede our efforts to uncover the deterministic factors that drive
single-cell behavior. Recent years have seen a growing awareness of this caveat and an increase in efforts to
identify the deterministic drivers (so-called “hidden variables”) of cellular individuality, but it is fair to say that we
still lack a satisfactory picture for what drives single-cell behavior even in the simplest systems, to say nothing
of more complex ones.
Research goal. The choice between rapid cell death (lysis) and viral dormancy (lysogeny), following infection of
E. coli by bacteriophage lambda, serves as a paradigm for the way genetic networks drive cell fate decisions,
and for the purported role of molecular randomness in this process. Building on our work over the last decade,
we will use lambda infection to identify hidden drivers of cellular individuality in gene regulation and fate choice.
By revealing how deterministic the decision process is, we aim to establish lambda as a paradigm for precise—
rather than “noisy”—cell fate choice. In parallel to the work on lambda, we will continue to develop tools for the
manipulation, imaging, analysis, and modeling of individual cells, and apply them in collaborative projects
addressing cellular individuality across diverse biological contexts."

Even though most men diagnosed with prostate cancer will not die of the disease, prostate cancer is still the
second leading cause of cancer death among men in the United States. While screening for prostate cancer
reduces death from disease, this comes at the price of both unnecessary biopsies that reveal no evidence of
cancer and treatment of otherwise indolent cancer resulting in unnecessary adverse events. Therefore, there
is an unmet need for improved screening tools for prostate cancer. To address this need, we have previously
developed a four-kallikrein biomarker panel that is now commercially available as a reflex test for use after an
initial PSA screening; found that the four kallikrein model improves the prediction, prior to any diagnosis of
prostate cancer, of which men may die of prostate cancer; and identified SNPs associated with survival time
after diagnosis, independent of known prognostic factors. Combining these SNPs and the four kallikrein panel
improves our ability to identify men at risk of dying from prostate cancer even further. Based on these findings,
we propose here a germline genomic approach to identify men at risk of dying from prostate cancer. By
leveraging recent computational advances in genomic analysis, we will take a gene-centered approach to
identify genes for which genetically controlled transcriptional alterations and/or functional coding mutations
influence survival time in prostate cancer. Using these genes, along with known genetic risk factors for prostate
cancer and the four kallikrein panel, we will build and test models designed to identify men at risk for clinically
significant prostate cancer in order to better stratify men in the screening context prior to biopsy. Specifically,
we will: 1) Identify genes for which genetically controlled expression level changes and/or rare coding variants
alter the risk of dying from prostate cancer; 2) Determine at what stage(s) of disease progression these genetic
changes operate; and 3) Improve our 4-kallikrein biomarker predictor of lethal prostate cancer through
incorporation of genetic data. This will be achieved by conducting both a transcriptome-wide association study
(TWAS) with prostate specific models and a whole exome sequencing study in a set of well-annotated cohorts
with long follow-up time after prostate cancer diagnosis. Successful completion of these aims will enable
better risk stratification of men prior to prostate cancer diagnosis. We envision these findings being useful in
the screening context, enabling more precise identification of men at high risk of dying from prostate cancer in
the next two decades, thereby reducing death from prostate cancer due to the benefits of early detection while
avoiding unnecessary biopsies and unneeded treatment of otherwise indolent cancers. Furthermore, these
findings will be useful in understanding the biology of lethal prostate cancer as we anticipate these findings will
pinpoint new genes and pathways that play important roles in prostate cancer progression."

patient survival is highly dependent on the cancer staging at the time of diagnosis and, despite
the recent progresses made in the clinical management of this disease, it remains a meagre 13%
for the patients diagnosed with cancer metastasis. Remarkably, resistance to the anti-cancer
therapy contributes heavily to the metastasis as ~90% of patients with metastatic cancer are also
resistant to the therapies. Thus, developing novel and targeted therapies for inhibiting CRC
progression and metastasis is essential and urgent.
In this regard, extensive preclinical and clinical studies from our laboratory, and of other
laboratories, have now validated a causal role for the upregulated claudin-1 expression in
promoting CRC metastasis. In a comprehensive analysis examining a large CRC-patient cohort,
cell lines and mouse models, we have reported a highly significant association of the deregulated
claudin-1 expression with CRC metastasis. Mechanistic investigations into these findings
revealed physical binding of claudin-1 with proto-oncogene Src, in promoting CRC metastasis. So
far, no known small molecule inhibitor for claudin-1 exists. Using a rigorous analytical design that
included in vitro and in vivo testing, we identified a claudin-1 specific inhibitor. Further analogs were
synthesized, we now have narrowed down our search to a novel and specific small molecule
inhibitor, PDS-0330, for efficient inhibition of the CLDN1 dependent CRC progression. These data
have led to the central hypothesis of this proposal that PDS-0330 can inhibit CLDN1/Src
association to inhibit CRC progression and metastasis. In this grant proposal, we will optimize the
potency, pharmacokinetic properties of PDS-0330 analogs to develop novel tool compounds. We
will also determine binding specificity and characterize the binding epitope of PDS-0330 to inhibit
colon cancer progression. Finally, we will determine the efficacy of PDS0330 in inhibiting Claudin-
1-dependent phenotypes in mouse and organoid model of aggressive CRC."

a new class of antiviral drugs, are designed to bind to the immature lattice and interfere with this transformation.
During the previous award period, we showed that the stability of the immature lattice is dependent on other HIV
components aside from the Gag polyprotein. The small size of HIV virions makes studying their lattice dynamics
challenging, therefore, we developed biophysical, imaging, and computational methods to enable these
measurements. We have two main aims for this award period. Our first aim is to investigate the specific effects
of different non-Gag components on the stability of the immature lattice and determine the nature of biomolecular
forces stabilizing it. Our second aim is to determine how dynamics within the lattice drive the activation of HIV
enzymes and kick start the maturation process. By advancing our understanding of the biomechanical principles
governing the immature lattice of HIV and its maturation, our studies will inform both the design of next-
generation antivirals as well as future lentiviral systems."

Carpal tunnel syndrome is the most common compressive neuropathy. The need for advancement in
therapeutic treatment modalities is evidenced by the disease prevalence, potential for surgical
complications and disparities in surgical availability amongst certain populations, particularly Hispanic
women. Addressing this area of need is critical for regions such as Tucson, Arizona, which has a
Hispanic population that is nearly half of the overall population. Non-surgical carpal arch space
augmentation (CASA) is a treatment modality for carpal tunnel syndrome developed by our Hand
Research Laboratory. This supplement has two specific aims. The first aim is to demonstrate
treatment efficacy of the CASA intervention for symptom relief and hand function improvement in
Hispanic women afflicted with carpal tunnel syndrome. The second aim is to compare the CASA
intervention and standard-of-care (SOC) brace treatment for symptom relief and hand function
improvement in Hispanic women with carpal tunnel syndrome. Hispanic women participants with
carpal tunnel syndrome will be randomized into CASA and SOC groups. The study design is
composed of a 4-week intervention phase and a 4-week follow-up phase. Patient-reported symptom
and function outcomes will be collected over the 8 weeks. We hypothesize that the CASA treatment
will alleviate symptoms and improve hand function of the carpal tunnel syndrome participants.
Furthermore, we hypothesize that CASA treatment will be more effective than the SOC in relieving
symptoms and improving hand function. Demonstrating the effectiveness of CASA in relieving
symptoms and improving hand function in Hispanic women will provide a contribution to advancing
treatment options of carpal tunnel syndrome for populations with evidenced healthcare disparities."

Objective Biotechnology is a spin-out from the University of Minnesota that is pioneering the use of machine
vision guided robots for automating precise microbiology procedures such as microinjection. Drosophila
melanogaster (fruit fly) is a model organism extensively used in both basic and clinical research. A key challenge
in Drosophila biological research is the bottleneck of generating and maintaining transgenic lines of flies.
Traditionally, transgenesis involves skilled technicians performing intricate and precise microinjection
procedures repeatedly. However, Objective Biotechnology Inc. has introduced an innovative solution - a
machine vision guided robot designed to automate the microinjection process for Drosophila
melanogaster embryos. This technology can also be adapted for use with various other organisms. This robot
eliminates the need for manual microinjection protocols, which are operator-dependent, time-consuming, and
require significant training. The robot uses machine learning (ML) models trained to detect individual embryos
on agar plates and guides microinjection needles to perform microinjections at specific locations in each detected
embryo. This robot can be operated by individuals with no prior experience and surpass human capabilities
in terms of microinjection speed, performing at a rate six times faster than humans.
In AIM 1 of this proposal, we will evaluate the efficacy and generalizability of the Autoinjector technology for
transgenesis across a wide spectrum of Drosophila experiments. This involves testing and refining the
automated microinjection process for different genetic backgrounds, microinjection locations, microinjectant
compositions, construct sizes, auxiliary plasmids or transgenes, as well as various operational variables such as
embryo laying conditions, culture media, DNA concentration, and solution viscosity.
AIM 2 of this proposal we will innovate the ML algorithms to address two identified failure modes in the automated
microinjection process. These failure modes are (1) the inability to detect individual embryos when they are
clustered together on the embryo collection plates and (2) the clogging of pipettes during automated
microinjection. We will develop ML-guided robotic algorithms to mitigate these issues and improve the overall
performance of the system."

The purpose of this application is to determine clinical, immunologic, and inflammatory factors that lead to
heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) for people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),
with the clinically relevant goal of improving HFpEF screening, prevention, and therapy for people with HIV
(PWH). HFpEF is a complex syndrome with high mortality: 50% of persons with HFpEF die within 5 years of
diagnosis. Rates of HFpEF and diastolic dysfunction – the key structural abnormality underlying HFpEF – are
significantly higher for PWH than people without HIV, with recent studies finding a 4-8-fold higher prevalence of
diastolic dysfunction for PWH than people without HIV. In general, inflammation and immune dysfunction are
important precipitants of HFpEF, and may be particularly important for HIV-associated HFpEF. However, data
are limited regarding HFpEF clinical risk factors and pathophysiology in PWH. One key reason for this
continued scientific gap is that no large, diverse, multi-center cohorts of PWH have adjudicated heart failure
events or linked these to biospecimens – a necessary step to accurately characterize and investigate specific
subtypes of heart failure. We propose to do this in a large, modern cohort of >35,000 PWH in clinical care
throughout the United States; this cohort has an extensive array of individually-linked bio-specimens, patient-
reported outcomes, and access to clinical imaging data that are unique among large HIV cohorts and
necessary to comprehensively characterize HFpEF in HIV. Our central hypothesis is that PWH with incomplete
immune recovery, as indicated by lower CD4 counts and CD4/CD8 ratios, are especially susceptible to HFpEF
in the presence of “second hits” ranging from hypertension to specific ART classes associated with off-target
comorbidities (such as weight gain). In the first aim, we will investigate clinical risk factors and interactions
thereof which are most strongly associated with incident HFpEF for PWH. In the second aim, we seek to more
deeply understand the biology of HIV-associated HFpEF and will therefore leverage a multi-marker proteomics
panel – for which we have extensive pilot data in non-HIV HFpEF patients – to define immunologic and
inflammatory contributors to HFpEF for PWH. In Aim 3, we will use a novel method to determine, at a single-
cell level, meaningful differences in immune cell gene expression that may lead to systemic biomarker
abnormalities and HFpEF for PWH; we will validate these findings in cardiac tissue in Aim 4. We have data to
support the premise and feasibility of each aim, and our PI is ideally suited to lead the proposed analyses; as a
cardiologist, he recently served as writing chair of the American Heart Association's scientific statement on HIV
and CVD, a landmark document that required extensive multidisciplinary coordination. Led by the PI, our team
has the requisite methods and content expertise to successfully perform the analyses. Through completion of
the aims, we intend to generate key clinical and pathophysiological knowledge regarding HIV-associated HF
which will inform improved prevention, diagnosis, and ultimately treatment of HFpEF among PWH."

Depression, non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) and suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB) commonly emerge in
youth and each represent important risk factors for death by suicide. Early detection and intervention has the
promise of altering trajectories, improving adult outcomes and preventing suicide. Brain networks implicated in
depression (frontal-limbic threat, cortico-striatal approach/reward and default mode) undergo significant
change during childhood and adolescence; the manner of how these changes unfold may be critical to
understanding the onset and course of depression, NSSI, and STB. The Adolescent Brain Cognitive
Development (ABCD) is a population-based study that is following over 11,000 children annually over 10
years, with clinical and neuroimaging data from the first three years already publicly available. Since ABCD
data collection spans a critical developmental window notable for significant rises in depression, NSSI and
STB, analyzing this data presents an ideal opportunity to characterize the links between neural network
changes and unfolding risk for suicide in youth. Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) can be used to characterize brain
network structure and organization. While our laboratory and others have extensively applied standard
functional connectivity methods to characterize strength within depression networks using cross-sectional
designs, longitudinal designs are needed to understand now aberrant development in network strength may
contribute to onset depression, NSSI and STB. Recently, novel approaches have emerged to estimate
network flexibility from rsfMRI data. These include drawing from information theory to measure entropy of
brain signals and from dynamic connectivity analyses to measure state-switching, or shifts between brain
network configurations during rest. Our preliminary data point to inverse relationships between brain flexibility
(entropy and state-switching frequency) and depression, NSSI and STB in adolescents, suggesting a potential
neural mechanism for getting “stuck” in negative ways of thinking and feeling. We propose that individual
differences in the trajectory of neural network strength and flexibility changes across childhood and
adolescence may help explain the emergence of depression and suicide risk in adolescents. In our conceptual
model, inherited and environmental factors shape network developmental trajectories, which in turn underlie
the emergence of depression, NSSI and STB. This proposal seeks to delineate the neurodevelopmental
trajectories of strength and flexibility in fronto-limbic threat, cortico-striatal approach/reward and default mode
networks associated with the risk, onset and early course of depression, NSSI and STB in children and
adolescents in the ABCD study using novel analytic strategies. New insights from this study will provide the
foundation for designing personalized interventions to facilitate early detection of depression and suicide risk,
and to guide interventions capable of restoring healthy brain development and averting serious negative
outcomes including suicide."
11018758,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Recent estimates suggest one in four children under age 18 have a behavioral health (BH) diagnosis such as
anxiety or depression. Limited health insurance coverage, a paucity of BH providers, and stigma associated
with BH disorders result in less than half of children receiving evidence-based treatment. Children with a high
number of adverse childhood experiences, lower socio-economic status, and who are members of minoritized
populations, including sexual and gender minority (SGM) youth, have a higher risk for BH disorders and
disparate healthcare. SGM youth have higher risk of self-injurious thoughts and behaviors compared to their
non-SGM peers. Accountable care organizations (ACOs) incentivize care integration and population health,
which promotes care coordination, linkages to community-based services, and development of interventions to
address social determinants of health. Despite widespread use of ACOs in state Medicaid programs (12 states
in 2021) and the potential for innovative reforms introduced by ACOs to improve BH care for children in
vulnerable populations, little is known about ACOs’ impact on pediatric BH care. Our parent grant (NIMH
R01MH134176) aims to identify the impacts of ACOs on BH care quality, outcomes, and experience, including
identifying heterogeneity of effects among ACOs with different organizational features. This administrative
supplement will allow us to enhance our ongoing research with additional information about the role of
Medicaid ACOs in care for SGM youth and whether organizational differences in ACOs contribute to patient
experience for Medicaid insured SGM youth with BH disorders. In response to Notice of Special Interest
(NOSI) NOT-OD-22-032, we propose to enhance our parent grant by (enhanced Aim 2) describing ACOs’
organizational approaches to care for SGM youth and (enhanced Aim 3) inclusion of SGM youth experience
with BH care in the assessment of the association of Medicaid ACO organizational features with parent/patient
experience through targeted sampling to achieve an adequate sample size. This proposed supplement is
responsive to the NOSI as our parent grant is examining access to health-related services and associated
barriers among children with BH disorders, and this supplement will allow us to enhance our existing aims with
additional data collection on ACO approaches to care for SGM populations and the addition of SGM youth
participants. The timing is ideal to complete the study within 12 months given our study team’s recent
experience with studies focusing on SGM youth populations and overlap with planned timing of parent grant
data collection activities. The proposed research is important due to ongoing inequities in access and
outcomes, including suicide, between SGM and non-SGM youth. This study will provide important insights
about whether Medicaid ACOs are addressing disproportionate burdens among SGM youth and inform future
studies on the role of delivery and financing reform in BH care for SGM youth."

program will continue to enhance statewide infrastructure and research capacity while training the next
generation of Oklahoma’s biomedical research workforce."
11007797,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
More than 200,000 children die each year from TB, of whom 80% are <5 years old. HIV is a leading risk factor
for TB disease in both children and adults. Despite longstanding reliance upon household contact tracing to
identify children with TB, recent estimates suggest that only 10-30% of children with TB are infected within their
households. Meanwhile a massive pediatric TB detection gap exists, with only 40% of children <5 years old
with TB disease being diagnosed and reported. Understanding where and from whom children are infected
with TB is vital to closing this gap. Because adult HIV likely affects both the composition and TB burden of
children’s “contact networks”, it is critical to examine the role adult HIV plays in driving TB transmission to
children. It is likewise essential to examine the interaction between adult HIV and child TB in a growing group
that is highly susceptible to early childhood infections: children who are HIV exposed but uninfected. The
proposed project aims to evaluate the interplay between caregiver/adult HIV infection, complex and dynamic
child contact networks, and child TB exposure and incidence. To do so, in Aim 1 I will leverage the Pediatric
TB Contact Studies Consortium individual patient data meta-analysis database to measure the association
between adult index case HIV status and prevalent and incident child TB infection and disease. In Aim 2, I will
use egocentric social network analysis to track the evolution of social networks among children who are HIV
exposed but uninfected and who are enrolled in a prospective birth cohort study in the Western Cape province,
South Africa. Through this aim, I will explore how changes in social network diversity relate to cumulative TB
incidence in the first 2 years of life in this high-risk population. In Aim 3, I will employ ethnographic methods to
generate detailed assessments of “household fluidity”—a qualitative measure of household composition,
relational ties, and residential structure—to identify opportunities for TB exposure that have been historically
overlooked in traditional household contact tracing. These activities will take place within the rich HIV and TB
academic environments at Boston Medical Center/Boston University and Stellenbosch University (South
Africa), and in the high HIV/TB-burden setting of Worcester, South Africa. Melded with a training plan that
balances coursework, workshops, and hands-on experience, these research aims will provide an ideal
framework for me to develop skills in survival analysis using clustered data, social network analysis, and
ethnography. The proposed projects and training will enable me to become an independent investigator
conducting prospective, longitudinal, social-epidemiological studies at the intersection of pediatric TB and HIV.
An experienced mentorship team led by Dr. Karen Jacobson (Boston Medical Center/Boston University) and
Dr. Graeme Hoddinott (Stellenbosch University) will guide this training and support this research. My goal
through the proposed and future studies is to inform strategies to prevent and detect TB in children, who have
most to lose from and are most susceptible to this perennial pandemic."
11009694,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Methadone treatment (MT) for opioid use disorder (OUD) significantly reduces overdose risk, but remains
underutilized in the U.S. Limited availability of Opioid Treatment Programs (OTPs) – the only facilities licensed
to dispense methadone, as well as regulations that have often made accessing MT burdensome and stigmatiz-
ing for patients, have led to calls for a significant overhaul of the MT system. For the first time in decades, US
law makers are seriously considering reforms that could substantially change the nature of MT delivery. These
reforms range from expanding MT through mobile units that operate out of existing OTPs, to more significant
ones – such as making MT available through office-based prescribing and pharmacy dispensing, as proposed
by the “Modernizing Opioid Treatment Access Act (MOTA),” currently being reviewed by members of Con-
gress. As policy makers weigh such reforms, there remains much uncertainty about which changes will have
the greatest health benefits while minimizing harms, and how these changes will affect different population
groups. Empirical research is therefore urgently needed to help guide ongoing policy decisions.
 We propose to use an agent-based model (ABM) computer simulation approach to estimate the potential
impacts of four alternative MT policy scenarios currently being considered in U.S. policy discussions: “OTP
Only,” “Mobile Methadone,” “Addiction-Specialist Prescribing,” and “Primary Care Prescribing.” Specifically, we
will construct these simulated scenarios using an existing ABM our team has already calibrated for 16 counties
in NY State, and estimate how changing the environment and access points to MT within each scenario (e.g.
OTP, mobile units, prescriber, pharmacy locations) subsequently influences the following population level out-
comes: methadone initiation and six-month retention (Aim 1); fatal and non-fatal opioid overdose (Aim 2), and
racial/ethnic and urban/rural disparities for Aim 1 and 2 outcomes (Aim 3). We will parametrize and calibrate
each model using a combination of publicly and privately obtained data and existing literature, and test how
outcomes vary based on differential adoption of MT at the program, prescriber, pharmacy, patient level.
 This innovative proposal is an excellent fit for this “Time-Sensitive” FOA as it can inform current policy deci-
sions being considered by US law makers. It builds off of an existing ABM, which can ensure timely feasibility
and dissemination of findings. Our team brings together experts in OUD treatment policy, overdose, and simu-
lation modeling, and will be conducted in partnership with the NY State government’s Office of Addiction Ser-
vices and Supports, ensuring direct translation of findings to local policy decisions. We will also bring together
an Expert Advisory Board to help inform model inputs and disseminate findings to relevant stakeholders. Find-
ings will be made widely available via a public interactive dashboard, and will provide a foundation for a subse-
quent R01 to expand the ABM to other states. This work will critically inform national and local discussions to
promote evidence-based policies that lead to the greatest reductions in overdose and improvements in health."
11011767,"Project Summary: Darwin Babino, PhD, a trained pharmacologist/electrophysiologist, has
spent the last ten years working on several disciplines in the vision sciences. His proposal
entitled “Assessment of murine retinal acuity ex vivo by machine learning of multielectrode array
recordings” presents his overarching goal to improve vision restoration approaches by
developing methods to test the potential of these techniques thereby accelerating the
development of effective interventions. Dr. Babino and his primary mentor, Dr. Russell Van
Gelder, have assembled a strong team of co-mentors at the University of Washington SOM and
collaborators to guide him through the proposed training and research. His previous training will
be supplemented with goals to help his development as an independent investigator: 1) Study
design and practical learning in performing panretinal (MEA) biological experiments; 2)
Fundamental and advanced techniques of the proposed optogenetic and stem-cell restoration
techniques; 3) Application of advanced machine learning techniques; 4) Develop leadership and
professional skills to establish an independent group. The ability to assess the function of
panretinal circuitry will foster our understanding of the advantages and weaknesses of different
restoration techniques (Aim 1). The work proposed here will improve an existing retinal acuity
assessment tool which combines machine learning techniques on novel, high-density
multielectrode array recordings of ganglion cell responses in several mouse models. The utility
of this system will be demonstrated in assessing visual potential of the mouse retina in three
different approaches to vision restoration that are challenging for in vivo assessment (Aim 2). In
collaboration with Dr. Deepak A. Lamba at UCSF, we will apply our system to animals which
have undergone stem-cell replacement of retinal cells including photoreceptor cells. An
optogenetics approach will also be evaluated in collaboration with Dr. John Flannery at UC
Berkeley whose group has developed vectors for expressing rhodopsin and cone opsins in
ganglion and bipolar cells. Finally, differences between native and restored vison with small
molecule photoswitches, light-activated inhibitors of voltage-gated potassium channels, which
confer light-dependent firing on treated cells, will be assessed. The resulting advanced
electrophysiology application will help elucidate fundamental questions about the functional
retina, mechanisms that lead to retinal degeneration and the potential of several therapeutics for
the treatment of retinal diseases. Furthermore, this career development award will facilitate Dr.
Babino’s development into an independent investigator by priming an R01 grant application."

11014499,"Background: Black women represent the largest group of women with HIV, both nationally, and locally in Miami, a U.S.
HIV epicenter; and 40% are not virally suppressed. Further, they live at the intersection of multiple marginalized identities
and within social structures that take a daily toll. Microaggressions are every day and subtle insults via comments, jokes,
and behaviors that are demeaning to a marginalized group (e.g. Black individuals, women, people living with HIV,
LGBTQ+). Despite their frequency and potential importance, microaggressions have largely been ignored in the scientific
literature on Black women living with HIV (BWLWH). Also, while scholars are beginning to investigate macroaggressions
(discrimination acts such as denial of housing) and trauma/violence among women living with HIV, they are often only
captured infrequently (e.g. annually) despite their re-occurring nature for this population. Preliminary work. We have
further demonstrated the importance of studying microaggressions among BWLWH via an R56 that supported 1 year of
research that this 4-year proposal will build on. We are finding high rates of microaggressions in BWLWH, and high rates
of other adversities such as discrimination (macro acts) and reoccurring violence. These factors relate to mental health
symptoms and health behaviors, but additional data over time is needed to understand their relationship specifically to
viral suppression. Additionally, we are starting to understand the role of factors such as resilience, COVID-19, and the
current U.S. racial climate. Conceptual Model: The conceptual model for Project MMAGIC (Monitoring
Microaggressions and Adversities to Generate Interventions for Change) focuses on microaggressions and other
adversities as negative predictors of HIV viral suppression (main outcome) mediated by mental health symptoms and
health behaviors (ART adherence and engagement in care). We will longitudinally examine both potential direct effects
and moderation by resilience factors at the individual (e.g. self-efficacy), interpersonal (e.g. social support), and
neighborhood level (e.g. community health centers). By elucidating these pathways to viral suppression among BWLWH
and having ongoing engagement with community partners, our findings will directly inform interventions. This proposal is
precisely aligned with the NIH HIV/AIDS (high) Research Priority for supporting research to reduce health disparities in
treatment outcomes of those living with HIV. Research Plan: 300 BWLWH will be enrolled in Miami (151 enrolled [4 lost]
via R56 grant), and followed over 4 years. Data will be collected at assessment visits every 3 months on
microaggressions, discrimination/macroaggressions, trauma and violence, mental health symptoms, medication
adherence, engagement in care, viral suppression, and resilience factors. Given the daily nature of microaggressions,
we will use an innovative text-message ecological momentary assessment methodology shown to be feasible (99%
response rate) in our R56. Annually, we will gather information (using zip codes) from public data sources on
neighborhood level resilience resources such as number and distance to community health centers and domestic
violence shelters. Implications: The present study, occurring in the context of both COVID-19, and heighten visibility on
racism in the U.S. presents an unfortunate yet unmatched important opportunity to study BWLWH in an HIV epicenter."
11013614,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In my first K24 award, I mentored a total of 32 mentees, working with them on 87 papers in the last six
years and shepherding 19 successful NIH K-series career development awards (with 6 as primary mentor).
In the next five years, I seek to renew my K24 award to maintain protected time for mentoring and advance
three new and exciting perspectives in mentoring. First, is to evolve from an “apprenticeship” model of
mentoring to a “co-pilot” model based on a therapeutic alliance (from the 2020 National Academies of
Sciences report) using an “Appreciative Inquiry” approach — a strengths-based approach well-known in
organizational psychology but new to mentoring as well as set the pathway for their eventual transition to
mentors themselves. To do so, I will seek to use a standard approach for soliciting how mentees see their
successes and strengths as a basis for a shared objective in the mentoring relationship. Second, I have
come to look beyond the dyadic relationship to see mentoring as creating a professional ecosystem in
which a mentee can thrive. I therefore propose to foster peer-to-peer and peer-to-other mentor activities,
including an annual retreat to solidify peer relationships between mentees. Third, I see success in science
more explicitly as translational impact rather than solely publications and grants, and will use the K24 award
to support training for mentees on the Translational Science Benefits Model — a novel framework for
valuing scientific outputs — and communications skills. For my research enterprise, I propose to use the
K24 renewal to make modest but critical extensions to my existing research program advancing person-
centered public health. Person-centered in public health context does not imply that every individual’s
preference can be accommodated but rather takes three feasible forms. First, personalization implies that
public health services can detect and respond to effects on individuals. To carry that forward, I propose
learning more about adaptive behavioral interventions to strengthen engagement in HIV care. Second,
personalization also implies that the interpersonal domains of public health services are important, and patients
— even in a public health setting — when treated with respect, have better engagement and outcomes. Finally,
person-centered services in the context of today’s HIV epidemic implies the growing integration of non-
communicable diseases in HIV programs — a key domain of person-centered services and an area of policy
and scientific interest. The new research proposed in this K24 represent incremental scientific steps nested
within a larger, well-funded research infrastructure. These analyses will yield preliminary data and hypothesis,
generating findings that have value to new mentees and can yield accessible preliminary data for additional
proposals. At the end of this next cycle, I hope to have nurtured a crop of leading-edge, implementation-
oriented researchers focused on addressing the HIV/AIDS pandemic, both here in the US and globally. All of
my work is embedded within my institutional leadership roles and is supported by institutional leadership."

11013977,"Abstract. Existing antiretroviral drugs do not clear HIV-1 from infected individuals, requiring life-long administra-
tion. The HIV-1 Nef accessory factor is an attractive target for drug development because it supports HIV repli-
cation in vivo and promotes immune escape of HIV-infected cells. Our laboratory has discovered small molecules
that bind directly to Nef and inhibit its ability to enhance HIV-1 replication in cell culture. These inhibitors interfere
with Nef-mediated MHC-I downregulation in latently infected CD4 T cells, enabling recognition and killing by
CTLs. Thus, Nef inhibitors represent a new approach to antiretroviral therapy that may promote eradication of
viral reservoirs. During the previous funding cycle, we developed Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras (PROTACs)
for the targeted destruction of the Nef protein in HIV-infected cells. These PROTAC molecules induce ternary
complexes between Nef and the Cereblon E3 ubiquitin ligase resulting in Nef ubiquitylation and proteolytic deg-
radation. Nef PROTACs efficiently reverse Nef-mediated downregulation of MHC-I and CD4 from the T cell sur-
face and inhibit Nef-mediated enhancement of HIV-1 replication in donor PBMCs. PROTAC-mediated degra-
dation is likely to reverse all Nef functions, suppressing viral rebound while enhancing antiviral immunity
and reservoir reduction. Here we propose to explore the mechanism of action and on-target selectivity of our
Nef-directed PROTACs, their propensity for inducing acquired resistance, and their ability to enhance cellular
antiviral immunity. Our proposal is responsive to NOT-AI-23-049, Using Targeted Degradation of Protein and
non-Protein Targets for the Development of Novel Anti-Infectives, and PAR-23-297, Opportunities for HIV Cure
Strategies at the Time of ART Initiation. The following Specific Aims are proposed: 1) Determine the mecha-
nism of action of Nef-directed PROTACs. This Aim will identify the Nef lysine residues required for the initiation
of ubiquitylation by the PROTACs. In addition, PROTAC selectivity for Nef in T cells will be evaluated by prote-
omics. 2) Test the hypothesis the Nef PROTACs are unlikely to induce drug resistance in HIV-infected
cells. PBMCs will be infected with HIV-1 carrying a Nef mutant library in the presence or absence of ‘occupancy-
based’ Nef inhibitors vs. PROTACs. Resistance mutations will be identified in emergent viruses by RNAseq.
Targeted degraders may be less likely to generate resistance compared to their occupancy-based counterparts,
because elimination of Nef may make infected cells susceptible to apoptosis. 3) Test the hypothesis that tar-
geted degradation of HIV-1 Nef affects latent viral reservoirs. Nef-mediated downregulation of MHC-I and
induction of PD-1 both may serve to promote and stabilize HIV reservoirs. This Aim will examine reservoir cells
from HIV-infected donors to determine whether targeted degradation of Nef influences latency reversal and in-
creases the susceptibility of reservoir cells to detection and elimination by CTLs and NK cells. Altogether, suc-
cessful completion of this project will support continued development of Nef PROTACs as a new strategy for the
treatment of HIV infection with the potential to contribute to functional cure."
11019526,"Chronic MSK pain is marked by a complex biologic response accompanied by physiological perturbance in cognition, sleep, and energy levels (fatigue), and is associated with impairments in physical and emotional function. Moreover, the chronic pain experience is not stable over time with intra- and inter-daily fluctuations and the presence of pain flares contributing to unpredictability, uncertainty, and ultimately greater impairment. Current gold standard self-report assessment is burdensome and falls short of providing comprehensive, reliable measures of the pain experience, typically reflecting single point-of-care assessment with inherent recall bias. A potential solution lies in the ubiquitous consumer adoption of wearable devices that provide a window into human health. Through artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) several ground-breaking digital biosignatures of human health have been developed. This proposal overcomes the limitations of self-report by combining the precise physiological, sleep, and physical activity measures via wearable devices with AI/ML to develop and validate a monitoring digital biosignature of the individual pain experience in youth with MSK pain. We are well positioned to execute UG3/UH3 aims with: (1) a highly skilled team with scientific expertise in digital technology, AI/ML, digital endpoint development, and clinical trials, clinical expertise in chronic pain in youth, and lived experience expertise from patients, caregivers, and pain advocacy groups; (2) a centralized and standardized digital data collection, processing, and storage system, the scalable and secure My Personal Health Dashboard (MyPHD), and (3) preliminary data to support our digital biosignature development capability. For UG3 phase we will enroll 500 youth (ages 14-24) with chronic MSK pain, capturing continuous physiological (heart, respiratory), sleep, and physical (activity level, mobility, gait) activity metrics via wearables with repeated intra-daily gold standard self-report of pain experience (pain interference, pain intensity, fatigue, mood, stress, pain flares). We will Incorporate user feedback on wearable use and quality of life relevance of data captured, develop a digital biosignature of the pain experience, and prepare for the UH3 phase through outreach and collaboration with (a) individuals with lived experience, (b) individuals who experience health disparities, and (c) FDA to ensure relevance, acceptability, and recruitment of underrepresented youth coupled with scalability of the algorithm for clinical use. For UH3 phase we will enroll 400 diverse youth with chronic MSK pain capturing wearable and self-report of pain experience metrics for clinical validation of the pain experience digital biosignature and accuracy of an opportunity for enhanced wellness alert system. The successful development and validation of digital endpoints are crucial for the evolution of pain management. These endpoints can advance therapeutic development by providing robust, objective measures to monitor treatment response. Our studies, supported by this RFA, will be fundamental in seeking regulatory approval for the commercialization of the associated software or for disseminating open-source analysis packages for future clinical trials."
11007351,"ABSTRACT
In spite of the rich molecular-scale data provided, clinical applications of high-powered synchrotron radiation for
skeletal and cardiac muscle physiology — collectively known as muscle small-angle X-ray scattering or
(MyoSAXS) — are limited. MyoSAXS is the only technology available that directly images sarcomeric protein
organization in live tissue and is used both in fundamental muscle mechanics research and within the drug
development pipeline. Unfortunately, most applications still lie in academia where typical use cases involve
competitive access reservations months in advance at one of the few synchrotron beamlines in the world
equipped for near-physiological biological samples. The main barriers of entry are thus access, long lead times,
and a short supply of trained life-science beamline scientists in the field. As biological beamline scientists
ourselves, we recognized how strongly these barriers limit hundreds of academic and industry researchers from
using X-ray science and so we founded our firm, Accelerated Muscle Biotechnologies, as a science-as-a-service
solution specifically for MyoSAXS synchrotron applications and is the foundation of this application. For this
Phase I application, we propose to develop MyoSAXS infrastructure at the LiX beamline at Brookhaven National
Labs, a synchrotron facility on Long Island NY, initially for academic users who aren't beamline scientists
themselves but wish to acquire sarcomeric data and have more flexible requirements on lead times. We will
evaluate our advancement by studying the highly relevant mechanism of Mavacamten on muscle, a recent FDA-
approved drug for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy that directly suppresses muscle motor function and used
MyoSAXS experiments to show its' interactions with sarcomeric proteins. Our long-term vision however is for
MyoSAXS to be available for clinical research where hospitals can send skeletal or cardiac muscle biopsies for
molecular testing with at most a 1-week lead time. The proposed improvement at Brookhaven focuses on two
objectives: 1) to acquire MyoSAXS data comparable in quality to the current gold standard in the field and 2) to
develop reproducibility and repeatability (R&R) metrics to standardize data quality across different synchrotron
facilities. These objectives are critical necessities for our business strategy to use Brookhaven as an operational
base for the multiple healthcare and academic hubs in the northeast regional area and for future work at other
synchrotrons. The lessons learned here about data quality and R&R for muscle tissues are generalizable to other
biological samples as well, including renal and nervous tissue, and will set the path for further innovations of
synchrotron radiation in clinical applications."
11008126,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Xylyx is developing engineered human liver fibrotic lesions as a predictive cell-based assay platform to address the
lack of in-vitro drug testing assay products containing human fibrotic liver ECM in the market. Liver fibrosis is a
progressive disease process underlying multiple chronic liver diseases (NAFLD, NASH, ASH, hepatitis C) and leads
to cirrhosis, which causes over 1 million deaths/year worldwide. NASH alone affects 4% of the global population, and
30 million people in USA, where annual mortality exceeds 48,000. No drug is approved to treat liver fibrosis,
underscoring the inadequacy of current liver fibrosis models and the necessity of better drug testing assays. The
extracellular matrix (ECM) is known to play critical roles in liver fibrogenesis and fibro-proliferation. Animal models are
poor predictors of liver fibrosis in humans, and predictive in-vitro models of liver fibrosis are not commercially available,
leaving a significant unmet need and market gap/opportunity for a physiologically-relevant in-vitro platform that
enables high-fidelity cell-based phenotypic assays in engineered human liver fibrotic lesions. This SBIR Fast Track
will support development and validation studies for commercialization of a liver fibrosis cell-based assay platform
containing engineered human liver fibrotic lesions shown to be consistent with patient data. The technological
innovation is the product’s engineered human liver fibrotic lesions stemming from proprietary methods for isolating
and integrating acellular human fibrotic liver ECM that has the pathological properties of human diseased liver tissue.
Our approach integrates NASH patient-derived stellate cells, Kupffer cells, and hepatocytes in standardized human
primary fibrotic liver ECM, enabling predictive in-vitro assays on engineered human fibrotic liver lesions – a unique
product and major competitive advantage over all existing assays, which lack human liver fibrotic ECM and
histopathology. Our goal is to validate and commercialize a standard liver fibrosis cell-based assay platform for
predictive in-vitro modeling of human liver fibrosis to reduce dependence on animal models and de-risk preclinical
decision-making. Specific aims: (1) Perform multi-omics and histomorphologic profiling of engineered human fibrotic
liver lesions; (2) Determine histologic, molecular, phenotypic effects of Kupffer cells and hepatocytes on engineered
human liver fibrotic lesions; (3) Evaluate quality and consistency of engineered human liver fibrotic lesions assay
platform; (4) Test anti-fibrotic drug candidates using engineered human liver fibrotic lesions assay platform. After
successful completion of the Fast Track project, Xylyx will commercialize the liver fibrosis assay platform for scientists
in pharma companies in need of predictive fibrotic disease models for drug screening, thus reducing the massive
costs associated with late-stage attrition due to poor efficacy, and facilitating development of the first effective drug
treatment for millions worldwide with fibrotic liver diseases. As the industry leader in ECM-based kits and assays,
Xylyx will market the product worldwide in the rapidly growing cell-based assay market ($24.6B in 2022, CAGR:
12.7%, projected $60.3B by 2030), advancing drug development in the global NASH market ($160.7B by 2030).

11008129,"EARLY CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT OF MODIFIED P8 FOR THE TREATMENT OF ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE
SUMMARY: The pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) include the formation and accumulation in
the brain of Aß, widely recognized to be the major neurotoxic agent in AD. Earlier therapeutic attempts at
lowering total Aß production all failed as they directly targeted the catalytic activities of ß- or g-secretase,
enzymes known to hydrolyze other substrates besides APP, many with critical cellular functions. Most clinical
trials of both g- and more recently ß- secretase inhibitors have been discontinued due to safety issues. After
years of failures the first new drugs for AD in 20 years, monoclonal antibody (MAb) drugs Aduhelm and Leqembi,
were recently approved by the FDA. Both target Aß, but Leqebi is more effective. Although it shows only a
modest 27% cognitive improvement in patients, it provides the first definitive evidence that lowering Aß improves
cognitive performance. More recently, a third MAb drug Donanamab has shown better cognitive improvement
in clinical trials. These drugs represent promising first steps to developing new treatments to slow down and
stop AD. Approaches other than MAbs to reduce Aß need to be explored since there are many disadvantages
to MAb drugs. These include cost, mode of administration (by IV in the clinic once or twice a month) and safety
since all MAbs are known to cause ARIAs (swelling and bleeding in the brain). New therapeutic approaches that
can inhibit total Aß production without targeting the activities of the ß- or the g-secretase, that are not monoclonal
antibodies, are urgently needed. Cenna’s technology does just that.
 We have a novel technology that does not target the secretases, which has yielded several peptide drug
candidates with the ability to inhibit the production of Aß in vitro and in a transgenic (Tg) mouse model of AD.
Our best candidate, modified P8 (mP8), is 8-amino acids in length and can be delivered to the brain by
subcutaneous injection. mP8 is being developed as a new, first-in-class, disease-modifying peptide drug for the
treatment of AD. IND-enabling GLP ADME, toxicology and safety pharmacology studies on mP8 in rats and
monkeys have been completed. In this Direct-to-Phase 2 SBIR application we propose to carry out activities to
support a first in human clinical study. The proposed studies include CMC activities to support clinical
development of the drug product, to have a pre-IND meeting with the FDA and to submit an IND package and to
develop an early clinical program and carry out Phase 1 clinical trials of mP8."
11009291,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The Tulane National Primate Research Center (TNPRC) of Tulane University is one of seven National Primate
Research Centers (NPRC) sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The TNPRC is dedicated to
providing infrastructure and support for basic and applied research to advance scientific knowledge and improve
human and animal health and well-being. The TNPRC specific pathogen-free (SPF) rhesus macaque breeding
colony is among the largest in the NPRC program, with a census nearing 5000, and the TNPRC AIDS research
program is the largest research program at the Center. TNPRC’s SPF breeding colony serves as a national
resource for NIH-funded investigators and has supplied 2155 animals for research programs across the US in
the past five years, with the vast majority assigned to AIDS-related studies. Current NPRC breeding operations
cannot meet the continued high national demand for SPF rhesus macaques. The NIH-sponsored 2018 NHP
Evaluation and Analysis Project, designed to enhance understanding of the demand for and supply of nonhuman
primates (NHPs) within the US, noted that improving infrastructure and providing support for expansion of NHP
breeding colonies is necessary to ensure adequate supply of NHPs for biomedical research. The 2023 NIH-
commissioned independent National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) Consensus
Study Report on Nonhuman Primate Models in Biomedical Research: State of the Science and Future Needs
recognized the worsening shortage of NHP resources for NIH-sponsored research and emphasized the
importance of NHP research resources in responding to US public health emergencies and advancing
biomedical research. The NASEM report concluded that the US needs to prioritize expansion of domestic NHP
breeding programs. Along with funding from the NIH, the TNPRC has committed funds and initiated projects to
1) improve the breeding colony management program and 2) expand infrastructure to meet the current and
projected national demand. A primary component of the long-term infrastructure improvement plan is to increase
the number of indoor/outdoor housing facilities that will provide additional protection from inclement weather and
complement existing outdoor NHP housing enclosures. The proposed project will construct indoor/outdoor
enclosures to house and breed SPF rhesus macaques on the TNPRC breeding colony campus and provide
infrastructure for current and future expansion. These facilities will support our commitment to expand production
of SPF rhesus macaques to be used for NIH-established priority research areas (AIDS-related research) at the
TNPRC and nationally. The facilities have been designed in alignment with our long-term infrastructure
improvement plan to enhance protection of animals, increase overall group housing flexibility and capacity, and
provide novel and proven environmental enhancement. The animals produced as a result of this infrastructure
improvement project will help address the national shortage of SPF macaques."
11010739,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) affects nearly 25% of US veterans and is characterized by decreased functional β-cell
mass. Individuals with T2D have increased risk for heart disease and stroke. The incidence of T2D increases
with age, in part due to a decreased ability of β cells to respond to proliferative cues as they get older.
Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is elevated in the setting of obesity and T2D and is associated with decreased β-cell
function. PGE2 binds four G protein-couple receptors (GPCRs) designated E-Prostanoid (EP)1-4. The incretin
GLP-1 also exerts its effects through a GPCR and agonists of the GLP-1 receptor are used to treat T2D.
However, not every patient responds positively to this class of drugs, potentially due to increased activity of
negative regulatory pathways in the β cells of these individuals. Our lab discovered that the EP3 and EP4 PGE2
receptors modulate β-cell mass dynamics. We found that pharmacological inhibition of EP3 or activation of EP4
enhances β-cell proliferation and survival in both mouse and human islets ex vivo. Thus, EP3 and EP4 play
opposing roles in β cells with EP3 inhibiting and EP4 enhancing cellular functions. In addition, our preliminary
studies in the db/db mouse model of T2D reveal that systemic treatment with EP3 antagonist enhances β-cell
proliferation and mass and reverses some of the changes in gene expression associated with β-cell dysfunction.
Multiple splice variants of the EP3 receptor exist in all species. These variants have identical ligand binding
properties, but differ in their constitutive, agonist-independent activity, with the EP3γ isoform having the most
constitutive activity in mouse. EP3 expression increases with age and T2D in mouse and human islets and
decreases in response to β-cell mitogens. In mice, we found that EP3γ is most highly upregulated with age.
Constitutively active EP3 receptor would be unaffected by strategies such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatories
(NSAIDs) that lower synthesis of the ligand, PGE2. We will use a cell-based screening strategy to identify inverse
agonists that block constitutive EP3 activity. Whole genome sequencing and proteomics will define downstream
effects of EP3 and EP4 receptor modulation in β cells of db/db mice and islets from humans with T2D. Machine
learning approaches will be used to correlate expression of PGE2/EP pathway genes with T2D patient
phenotypes and to predict patient responsiveness to GLP-1 pathway agonists. Unique Vanderbilt resources (de-
identified electronic health record and linked DNA samples) will be used to assess whether NSAID use and/or
predicted lower EP3 expression or higher EP4 expression is associated with better outcomes. We hypothesize
that increased EP3 activity impairs β-cell identity and compensation leading to decreased functional β-cell mass
and decreased responsiveness to GLP-1 receptor activation in the setting of T2D and aging."
11010751,"Background: Primary care and prevention research among women Veterans across the life cycle is an area of
increasing focus within VA Health Administration (VHA). Increasing numbers of women Veterans are using the
VA for their general and gender-specific health care, representing a doubling in the past decade with 7% of all
Veterans seen in the VHA being women. Up to 20 percent of women Veterans experience urinary incontinence
(UI) and may be at increased risk due to exposures during military service, such as restricted toilet access and
the impact of heavy protective gear and equipment on the pelvic floor. These factors, along with known risk
factors such as pregnancy, childbirth, and menopausal transitions increase UI risk among women Veterans.
Significance/Impact: This proposed clinical trial focuses on improving access to first-line treatments for
women Veterans with UI. Several evidence-based treatments are available for UI including behavioral,
medical, and surgical therapies. Behavioral self-management treatments including pelvic floor muscle training,
bladder control strategies, and fluid management are widely recommended by guidelines as first-line treatment
options because of their demonstrated effectiveness and low risk of side effects. Women who receive
behavioral therapy for UI report greater confidence in self-management when provided with input from a
clinician with specific training in UI management. To identify gaps in UI treatment modalities within VHA, we
surveyed VA gynecologists, urologists, and behavioral and physical therapy providers for first-line treatment
options at VA Medical Centers across the nation. We found that only 55% of facilities reported offering pelvic
floor muscle training (PFMT), while 14% referred to another VA, and 44% referred to non-VA care. Sixteen
percent of facilities did not provide PFMT. Our data demonstrated that women Veterans have limited access to
clinicians who can provide these safe and effective treatments.
Innovation: Given the identified need to improve access to UI treatments, we developed and tested two
remote delivery models: an interactive mobile-health or mHealth UI smart phone/computer application and a
clinical video telehealth (CVT) visit. This proposed study will incorporate an innovative sequential, multiple
assignment, randomized trial (SMART) design to determine the optimal method for remote delivery.
Specific Aims: Our specific aims are to: (1) compare the effectiveness among women Veterans of two remote
delivery models for evidenced-based behavioral UI treatment, an interactive mHealth smart phone/computer
application versus a remote CVT visit; (2) use a SMART design to optimize UI symptom improvement for
women who do not respond to either type of remote delivery; (3) explore key factors that could influence future
remote UI treatment dissemination. Our overarching hypothesis is that women Veterans who receive the
interactive mHealth application will achieve greater reduction in UI symptoms compared to the training
provided in a remote CVT visit. The broad goal is to improve access to evidenced-based UI treatments.
Methodology: Including expertise from the Women’s Health Practice-Based Research Network, the
Birmingham VAMC, the Atlanta VAHCS, and the Durham VAMC, we will randomize 260 women Veterans (86
per site). We will compare the effectiveness of our mHealth UI application to a CVT session by evaluating the
sequential addition of an additional 1:1 CVT visit for non-responders in both randomization groups. This
SMART design includes two randomization stages and compares 1 optimization factor over a 3-month
intervention period with validated UI symptom outcomes assessed at baseline, 8-weeks, 12-weeks (primary
outcome), and 6-months for durabiltiy. Additionally, we will use qualitative methods to identify key factors
influencing participation and dissemination from women Veterans and providers.
Next Steps/Implementation: Our next steps will be to test the ability to implement the most effective modality
for improving access to UI care for women Veterans across a wider array of VHA facilities."
11013667,"Kidney transplantation is currently the optimal renal replacement therapy due to reduced morbidity and mortality,
better quality of life, and decreased cost compared to dialysis. However, transplants remain severely limited by
a shortage of donor kidneys available for transplantation, with over 90,000 patients on the waiting list. This
imbalance in supply and demand has resulted in a strong desire to use high-risk kidney grafts from older donors
and donors after circulatory death (DCD). These high-risk kidney grafts often incur significant injury during
preservation and transportation prior to transplantation, leading to diminished graft survival. As such, high-risk
kidney grafts are discarded at high rates because of the inability to predict their function. To improve the
preservation and acceptance of high-risk kidney grafts, including DCD kidneys, investigators at the Duke Ex Vivo
Organ Lab (DEVOL) and BioMedInnovations LLC (BMI) have developed a unique subnormothermic (22-25°C,
approximately room temperature) oxygenated perfusion platform, consisting of a perfusion device and matched
“DEVOL solution”. Pilot studies using a porcine model of DCD kidney transplantation demonstrated significant
improvements in post-transplant kidney graft function versus the historical standard of care, static cold storage
(SCS).
Consistent with the NIDDK SBIR research priority “development of devices or techniques to enhance the long-
term success of kidney transplantation (e.g., techniques for kidney storage and preservation)”, this project will
generate evidence that the BMI platform provides superior performance to the current standard of care for high-
risk kidneys, namely hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP). Availability of this data would result in this
technology rapidly moving forward to commercialization.
The project includes Specific Aims to 1) optimize the engineering aspects of BMI’s platform (consisting of the
device and perfusate); 2) determine, ex-vivo, the impact of warm ischemic injury and duration of device
preservation on kidney graft injury for the BMI platform versus the current standard of care; and 3) compare the
function of high-risk kidney grafts preserved with the BMI platform versus the current standard of care using a
porcine kidney auto-transplant model.
The outcome of this project will include preclinical evidence that demonstrates that BMI’s platform is likely to
provide a meaningful advance over the current standard of care when used in humans and advance the platform
towards commercialization. This will help BMI to secure further investment, successfully engage with regulators
and ultimately, gain customer adoption that leads to improved access to kidneys for those on the transplant
waiting list."

While antiretroviral therapy successfully suppresses HIV replication, immune activation and inflammation
persist, albeit at lower levels, and has been associated to as an important contributor of morbidity and
mortality in PWH. The clinical significance of immune activation is the evidence that demonstrates that HIV-
associated T cell immune activation and inflammation drive cardiovascular risk, independent of the traditional
risk factors, duration of antiretroviral treatment, and CD4 counts. Persistent HIV reservoirs are independently
associated with incident carotid plaque, and people with coronary artery atherosclerotic plaques show higher
levels of HIV DNA compared to those without disease. The molecular pathways by which HIV contributes to the
increased risk is largely unknown, and difficult the development of more targeted therapies.
CD8 T cell immune activation is associated with endothelial inflammation and dysfunction, and in this study, we
hypothesize that HIV-driven CD8 T cell immune activation promotes secretion of granzymes contributing to
vascular inflammation/injury. We will test this hypothesis by: Aim1. Granzymes expression regulation by memory
CD8 T cell subsets and virus-specific CD8 T cells recruited to the sites of vascular injury to define their
proinflammatory vs cytotoxic potential. Aim2. Granzyme expressing CD8 T cells enhance atherosclerosis
progression during infection. We will assess the extracellular contribution of granzymes and their impact in the
progression of a disease during infection."
11014941,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is now the most common mental health diagnosis among the youngest
generation of Veterans receiving treatment from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), necessitating the
need for diverse types of targeted care. Although there are two evidence-based psychotherapies (EBP) for
PTSD, the vast majority of combat Veterans who receive these treatments still meet diagnostic criteria for
PTSD and their functioning continues to be impacted. Furthermore, Veterans that have experienced trauma
related to killing have high rates of suicide and more severe PTSD symptoms. Although there have been few
studies examining predictors of poor outcomes in EBPs, one area that has recently begun to receive growing
attention is moral injury. A recent study found that PTSD and moral injury were distinct constructs with unique
signs and symptoms, and preliminary evidence indicates that the feelings of guilt and anger that characterize
moral injury associated with trauma such as killing in war may contribute to worsening symptoms over the
course of existing treatments. Although PTSD may be one manifestation of psychological trauma related to
killing, conceptualization of the impact of killing requires a broader framework. The emerging concept of moral
injury offers an alternative context to better understand the many possible outcomes of exposure to killing. For
these reasons, the development of targeted moral injury interventions is critical. We designed and received VA
funding to conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the Impact of Killing (IOK) treatment, which can
be seamlessly added as a standalone treatment following existing EBPs for PTSD. IOK focuses on key themes
including physiology of killing responses, moral injury, self-forgiveness, and improved post-deployment
reintegration. The treatment was designed to fit well into already existing systems of care and has been shown
to improve functioning, PTSD symptoms, and general psychiatric symptoms following EBP. Whereas the IOK
RCT pilot was initially conducted at the San Francisco VA Healthcare System, our goal is to conduct a fully-
powered, multi-site efficacy trial at two regionally-diverse sites with a larger sample size and active control
condition. Consequently, the objective of this project is to test the efficacy of an individual treatment for PTSD
stemming from moral injury called IOK, compared to a present-centered therapy (PCT) control condition, and
to determine the rehabilitative utility of IOK for Veterans seeking treatment for PTSD. Our primary outcome is
psychosocial functioning. The target population is Veterans who have initiated or completed Cognitive
Processing Therapy or Prolonged Exposure Therapy, two EBPs for PTSD, and continue to have PTSD
symptoms and moral injury related to killing. Veterans will be randomly assigned to receive either: 1) IOK (10
individual therapy sessions lasting 60-90 minutes) or 2) PCT (sessions of equal duration to IOK). Our first aim
is to test the efficacy of IOK through measures of psychosocial functioning (primary outcome) and PTSD
severity (secondary outcome). Our second aim is to determine whether IOK gains made by Veterans are
durable. Given that moral injury treatment is a new and burgeoning area, we have two exploratory aims that
can help move the field forward. Our first exploratory aim is to conduct post-treatment evaluations with a
subset of the IOK treatment group to better understand how to support continued improvement in functioning
among participants. Our second exploratory aim is to evaluate mediators of functional improvement, such as
self-forgiveness, among Veterans completing IOK. If the aims of this grant are achieved, we will be able to
have a moral injury intervention following EBP that can be seamlessly integrated into existing care for one of
the most commonly occurring mental health problems in Veterans. Furthermore, suicide is a national priority
for VHA, and expanding treatment for PTSD and moral injury has the potential to decrease suicide and
improve functioning in Veterans. Finally, IOK offers skills and ways of understanding warzone experiences that
can be mastered and can continue to be implemented by Veterans over time."

There is compelling evidence that the social determinants of health (SDOH) represent primary drivers of health
inequities, but dominant approaches to mitigating harmful SDOH have had inadequate success in reducing
persistent health inequities. The Nursing Science Incubator for SDOH Solutions (N-SISS) at the Johns Hopkins
School of Nursing will support nurse scientists and scientists in aligned fields in developing innovative and
rigorous programs of research focused on health equity, with a particular emphasis on SDOH. Because we
intend to deliver N-SISS educational materials to two important but distinct audiences—that is, three annual
cohorts of 10 core N-SISS Innovators as well as a national audience of nursing or aligned SDOH researchers
and students (ancillary N-SISS network trainees)—we organized the N-SISS program into two tailored sets of
activities and resources. At its core, the program will consist of a 10-month-long structured training curriculum
of individualized SDOH research training, applied research experiences, mentoring, and career support, which
will be offered to core N-SISS Innovators and which will culminate in the submission of an SDOH-focused
research (R, K, or F) grant proposal to NIH at the end of the program. Secondarily, the ancillary N-SISS
network trainee program will provide a variety of SDOH training resources for self-directed learning via a
dedicated web platform open to all researchers and students at no cost. The N-SISS program design is
innovative in several respects: the curriculum draws upon the project team's integrated conceptual framework
of SDOH mechanisms to provide the requisite theoretical and methodological skills for applied SDOH
mitigation; the program uses a three-pronged mentoring approach grounded in the literature of effective
scientific mentoring for independent research; and the didactic and collaborative learning opportunities are
additive, providing flexibility and enhancing the reach to national audiences. To increase reach and participant
representation, the program will strategically identify and support investigators determined by NIH and NINR to
be underrepresented in sponsored research. In addition, the program materials and events will be accessible
to ancillary N-SISS network trainees, who include members of the broader nursing and aligned scientific
workforce (we estimate at least n=3,600 ancillary network trainees will use the program over the project
period). N-SISS will leverage Johns Hopkins University's extensive research and training infrastructure and the
program directors' national network of health equity researchers to strengthen the scientific nursing workforce's
capacity to conduct impactful, innovative SDOH research to eliminate health inequities and redesign health."
11012570,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In light of the opioid crises, minimizing postoperative pain and postoperative opioid requirements to reduce
chronic opioid dependency among surgical patients have become major concerns for surgeons and
anesthesiologists. Effective intraoperative nociception control can mitigate these concerns. Unfortunately,
existing nociceptive monitoring tools use indicators that are inherently susceptible to intraoperative influences.
Monitoring these indicators often lead to suboptimal intraoperative opioid administration, since there is no way
to account for whether these measures are being influenced by nociception or numerous other intraoperative
factors such as blood loss, anesthetic drugs and antihypertensives. Therefore, improved methods to monitor
surgical nociception are clearly needed. In short, currently available nociceptive monitors measure unreliable
indicators and predispose surgical patients to suboptimal opioid dosing administration leading to ineffective
intraoperative control. The consequences for surgical patients can be significant, since increased postoperative
pain and opioid requirements is associated with increased incidence of opioid dependency. This project
proposes to develop a state-of-the-art sensors, algorithms, and prospective observational data to construct an
integrated measure of nociceptive control based on autonomic (EDA) and neurophysiologic markers of arousal
and nociception (EEG-based arousal and opioid signatures)."
11012589,"Project summary/abstract (as submitted for R00):
RNA processing is an essential cellular process that when dysregulated underlies the development of
neurological diseases. Several mutations in nuclease containing complexes cause pontocerebellar hypoplasia
(PCH), a severe neurological disorder that often leads to prenatal death. Most cases of PCH are linked to
mutations in the tRNA Splicing Endonuclease (TSEN) Complex, a heterotetramer responsible for the cleavage
of tRNA introns prior to tRNA maturation, and its accessory protein, CLP1, which is a critical negative regulator
of tRNA splicing. Genetic deletion of any single TSEN protein in yeast, engineered to have tRNAs without introns,
was shown to be lethal, suggesting that the TSEN complex likely has substrates beyond the tRNAs, which may
underlie the development of PCH. Likewise, mutations in many other RNA processing factors are also linked to
PCH.
To determine how mutations in certain RNA processing proteins such as CLP1 and TSEN protein lead to PCH,
there remains a critical need to understand how these complexes assemble, are regulated, and how they
recognize and process RNAs. Characterizing healthy cellular roles of these proteins is essential to determining
how their dysfunction causes PCH. We aim to address these critical questions through the following proposed
Aims. In Aim 1, we will determine how the CLP1/TSEN complex are regulated at the molecular and cellular level,
how PCH mutations disrupt their regulation, and determine if abhorrent tRNA splicing products contribute to cell
death, which may underlie PCH development. Further, in Aim 2, we will identify how PCH mutations alter the
function and regulation of another RNA processing factor linked to PCH by determining how it specifically
identifies and processes RNAs, how PCH mutations interfere with protein:protein interactions, and determining
additional ways it may be regulated, using proteomics and molecular biology approaches.
The proposed work is significant because it will provide mechanistic insight into how known PCH mutations may
interfere with complex stability, function, or regulation for a range of PCH-linked proteins. This work will further
provide insight into shared mechanisms by which these protein complexes cause PCH. Furthermore, the work
here will characterize new RNA processing roles for these enzymes."

11009295,"Developing a vaccine that can elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) against HIV remains a significant
challenge in the fight against HIV/AIDS. One major vulnerable site on the envelope protein that bnAbs
recognize is the fusion peptide (FP) on the Env. Although considerable efforts and progress have been made
to induce bnAb responses targeting this site by chemically conjugating FP with carrier proteins such as KLH,
which is difficult to use in human trials, broad and potent neutralization has not yet been achieved. In a recent
rabbit pilot study, we demonstrated that a recombinant FP-cholera toxin subunit B (FP-CTB) fusion
immunogen, in combination with a heterologous Env trimer boost, elicited tier 2 neutralizing antibody
responses against a standard global panel of viruses with unprecedented breadth and potency. CTB is the B
subunit of the AB toxin from the pathogen Vibrio cholerae and belongs to the well-known AB toxins with
pentameric B subunits. There are four main families of AB toxins: Cholera Toxin (CT), Pertussis Toxin (PT),
Shiga toxin (ST), and Subtilase cytotoxin (SU), each with different immunomodulatory properties. CTB is
particularly known for its mucosal adjuvant properties. We have previously used the pentameric B subunits to
carry gp120 V3 and V1V2 domains and demonstrated their strong capacity for immunofocusing and induction
of durable epitope-specific Ab responses. Furthermore, recombinant CTB has already been used in human
vaccines, making FP-CTB a promising vaccine candidate. Our central hypothesis is that fusing the flexible FP
onto a highly immunogenic toxin B subunit can help focus immune responses on the FP epitope, and these
responses can be guided to develop neutralization breadth by heterologous boosting using native Env trimers.
Building upon our exciting and promising preliminary results, we propose to advance the development of the
FP and toxin B subunit-based immunogens to improve the potency and breadth of bnAb responses. Our team
has the necessary expertise and resources to achieve this goal, and we have three aims, including Aim 1: Lay
the groundwork for a novel AB toxin B subunit-based FP vaccine, Aim 2: Improve the Breadth and Potency of
Neutralizing Antibody Responses, and Aim 3: Test the immunogenicity of refined FP immunogens in NHPs.
Upon completion of this project, our panel of novel FP immunogens will be fully developed and characterized
for structure, antigenicity, and immunogenicity, and selected immunogens can then be moved forward in the
pipeline for NHP challenge studies."

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections affect the lives of more than 296 million people who are chronically infected
with HBV and are at risk of developing liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Every year approximately
820,000 people die due to HBV-related complications and currently there is no effective cure. At the same time
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infects about 38 million people worldwide. Among those, 7.4% globally and
15-28% in highly endemic areas are also infected with HBV. HIV/HBV co-infected individuals are at higher risk
to develop severe liver disease and liver cancer than HBV mono-infected people with mechanisms that are not
well understood.
 Chronicity of HBV infections is linked to the stability and maintenance of the covalently closed circular DNA
(cccDNA), which is the nuclear form of the HBV genome. The goal for a functional HBV cure relies on strategies
that will either eliminate or inactivate the cccDNA. Therapies that are based on nucleoside analogs do not target
the cccDNA while the mechanisms by which IFNα blocks HBV replication are not entirely understood in respect
to the direct or indirect effects on the cccDNA. Several investigational direct acting antivirals and host targets
that are implicated in HBV lifecycle are currently under investigation with the hope of achieving a cure. CRISPR
screens have emerged as robust tools to discover host restriction and host dependency factors across multiple
viral families and druggable genes provide information for the development of novel host-targeting therapeutics.
 HBV is exclusively a hepatotropic virus that infects only human hepatocytes and for studies that aim to
characterize host responses primary human hepatocytes are the only cells for such studies. In parallel, the main
target primary cell types for HIV are CD4+ T cells. Co-culture systems that incorporate these primary cell types
are optimal for understanding the crosstalk between HIV and HBV infected cells and characterize host factor
changes at the gene and protein level. Our robust and innovative co-culture systems provide unique
opportunities to study HIV/HBV co-infections. These, together with a series of rigorous and analytical methods
spanning from CRISPR screens in primary cells to proteomics, phosphoproteomics and secretomics approaches
will be used here for the discovery and validation of host factors and antivirals against HIV/HBV co-infections
with the potential to generate therapeutics for a functional HBV cure."

Each year, approximately 25% of US teens and emerging adults sustain physical, psychological, or sexual
abuse by dating partners. Many victims of dating violence (DV) experience a host of devastating
consequences, including acute and chronic mental and physical health problems, suicidality, delinquency, risky
sexual behavior, substance abuse, and academic/occupational failure. Moreover, perpetrators of teen DV are
at increased risk for continuing intimate partner violence in adulthood, and victims are at risk for future
victimization and perpetration. The vast majority of what we know about DV is derived from cross-sectional
studies, with a paucity of short-term longitudinal studies or long-term longitudinal studies where DV was a
secondary focus often assessed with single-item self-reported indicators. Moreover, existing long-term
longitudinal studies were conducted on older generations of adolescents. Given the changing landscape of
sexuality and intimate relationships, shifting norms in support of aggressive behaviors, and the advent of
electronic/social media, a contemporary long-term longitudinal study on DV is critically needed. To address
these questions and gaps in the literature, our research team (PI: Temple) completed an 8-wave/8-year
longitudinal study of DV in a large sample of 1,042 ethnically and socioeconomically diverse adolescents.
Participants were recruited and assessed as Freshman/Sophomore high school students (Mean age=15) in
2010, with follow-ups annually from 2011 through 2017 (from age 16 through age 22). We are proposing to
follow our current sample for an additional 5 years and add current partners of participants for the final 4 years.
When finished, we will have 13 years of rich DV data covering individuals from young adolescence through
young adulthood—during a period characterized by identity development and the beginning of dating to one
characterized by identity formation and the establishment of more permanent intimate relationships and life
trajectories. Specific aims are to examine 1) the longitudinal association of different forms of DV and their
association with later DV across multiple relationships; 2) the long-term impact of exposure to DV and other
adverse events on adult mental, physical, and psychosocial health; 3) dyadic influences on risk for, and
protection from, DV across time; and 4) differences in DV perpetration and victimization over time by sex, age,
sexual orientation, and race/ethnicity, and in the ability of risk and protective factors to concurrently and
prospectively predict DV and other adverse outcomes in each subgroup. This will be the longest study ever
conducted with a primary focus on DV, and provides an unprecedented opportunity to examine trajectories,
risk and protective factors, course, and consequences of a wide spectrum of abusive behaviors. The study will
undoubtedly inform the development of critically needed DV prevention and treatment programs."
11010738,"Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is the leading evidence-based psychotherapy for depression, which
affects 18.5% of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), and Operation New
Dawn (OND) Veterans (hereafter referred to as OEF/OIF). Yet, OEF/OIF Veterans had only a 30% average
reduction in mean depression scores from the initial to later phase of treatment. This was true despite the
rigorous training and certification procedures for VA CBT-D. Improving the rate of depression recovery and
remission is vital to enhance OEF/OIF Veteran’s ability to improve work and home adjustment and overall
quality of life.
 Broad access to all key ingredients of CBT, including skills practice (homework), is associated with
improved and faster recovery from depression. OEF/OIF Veterans and patients with depression have reported
many barriers (i.e., time, chaotic lifestyles, and low energy) to following through with their skills practice
assignments. In the absence of targeted strategies/interventions to address the barriers that prevent CBT skills
practice, OEF/OIF Veterans will remain unable to reap the full benefits/effects of CBT. With specific tailored
interventions to address this gap in treatment, OEF/OIF Veterans will improve rates of recovery from
depression, diminished home and work adjustment, and poor quality of life.
 Leveraging the technological savvy of this generation of Veterans to improve access to CBT skills
practice is a logical tactic to address this gap in treatment. Smartphone apps have been identified as a useful
widely-used tool to improve the effectiveness of psychological treatments. There is, however, a paucity of
empirical studies on the use of mobile apps in the treatment of depressed OEF/OIF Veterans and in
psychological treatment overall. The promising pilot results of a comprehensive tailored smartphone app for
CBT skills practice for OEF/OIF Veterans (“CBT MobileWork-V”), leads us to propose a larger-scale
randomized clinical trial (RCT) to measure the efficacy of CBT enhanced with CBTMobileWork-V (the
experimental arm) for improving CBT understanding and skill acquisition and depressive symptoms, in
OEF/OIF Veterans with depression compared to standard CBT-D. Specifically, over a 27-month period we
propose to randomize 268 eligible OEF/OIF Veterans with depressive symptoms, to either CBT augmented
with the comprehensive CBT skill training smartphone app CBT MobileWork-V or standard CBT-D with
traditional skills practice methods (i.e., paper and pencil). The Specific Aims of this study are:
Primary Aim 1) To assess whether CBT-D augmented with CBT MobileWork-V (hereafter referred to as CBT-
D+) promotes greater CBT understanding and skill acquisition compared to traditional CBT-D.
Primary Aim 2a) To examine the short-term effect in depressive symptoms after 12 weeks of CBT-D+ versus
standard CBT-D.
Primary Aim 2b) To examine the long-term effect in depressive symptoms at 6 months post treatment of the
CBT-D+ intervention versus traditional CBT-D."

The advancement of combinational antiretroviral therapy (cART) converts the life of people living with HIV
(PLWH) to manageable diseases. However, due to the persistence of viral reservoirs, a cure for HIV remains
elusive. That implies we need to eliminate and/or reduce the size of the viral reservoirs to achieve a cure. It has
been reported that Neonates/infants whose immune system is dominated by naïve T cells with a limited number
of antigen-specific memory T cells have a small HIV reservoir compared to adults. Chronological aging leads to
the clonal expansion of effector memory T cells with simultaneous loss of naïve T cells, resulting in a Naïve-
memory imbalance. In CNS, with aging, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakiness keeps increasing, and chronic
activation of microglia/perivascular macrophages occurs. Additionally, aging-associated epigenetic changes in
immune cells result in chronic inflammation in older people. How all these factors impact HIV reservoirs in older
PLWH remains understudied and has significant implications for developing HIV cure research strategies for
aged PLWH. Therefore, this proposal aims to understand how age-associated alterations in composition,
epigenetic state, and functionality of immune cells alter the HIV reservoirs using SIV-infected, ART-treated young
vs. aged rhesus macaques. We will study the age-associated changes in (1) DNA methylation pattern, (2) SIV
integration site, and (3) in composition/functionality of T-cell and monocyte/ macrophages/microglia subsets from
PBMC, lymph nodes, rectal tissue, and brain in young vs. aged macaques. Subsequently, we will measure the
SIV reservoirs in all these cell types. We anticipate that understanding the aging-associated changes in immune
cells at viral reservoir sanctuaries will help to provide a more informed approach to designing HIV cure research
interventions for older people living with HIV."
11010649,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Ensuring equitable breastfeeding support is essential, as breastfeeding rates among Hispanic and non-
Hispanic Black (Black) individuals decline significantly beyond birth. Specifically, approximately 80% of
Hispanic and Black infants are breastfeed at birth, but only half continue receiving breastmilk at 6 months and
one-third at 12 months of age, respectively. Social determinants of health and equity (i.e., environmental
factors, healthcare practices, state legislation) play pivotal roles in shaping breastfeeding outcomes among
minoritized individuals. While successful strategies exist, including integrated lactation services and
community resources, their accessibility is influenced by environmental characteristics, with affluent
neighborhoods proving more conducive to sustained breastfeeding. Recognizing the need for improved access
to breastfeeding resources, virtual lactation support (telelactation) emerges as a potential solution to address
breastfeeding disparities that affect Hispanic and Black populations, but its effectiveness across demographic
and socioeconomic lines in minoritized populations is nascent. To address this evidence gap, this project
highlights the potential of telelactation in bridging the gap between lactation support needs and access for
Hispanic and Black individuals in underserved neighborhoods. The proposed supplement is a secondary
analysis of data from the Tele-MILC study, which is an innovative “siteless” randomized controlled trial to
evaluate the impact of telelactation on breastfeeding outcomes. This project will include 1,459 Hispanic and
Black participants surveyed at baseline, 1-month, and 6-months. The study arms included a treatment arm who
accessed Pacify Health's app, offering 24/7 telelactation visits, while the control arm received standard care,
monitored for potential contamination; both arms were followed through 24 weeks postpartum. Quantitative
data on breastfeeding duration and exclusivity using self-reported measures at 4 and 24 weeks will be included,
as well as indicators of social determinants of health and equity (e.g., Neighborhood Deprivation Index,
availability of obstetric care providers) to quantify structural (dis)advantages of participants. The specific aims
are: 1) Describe the extent to which there are differences in the social, environmental, and structural factors of
parents in the Tele-MILC study by race/ethnicity; 2) Identify associations between breastfeeding outcomes and
the social determinants of health and equity, and structural factors (examined in Aim 1) that impact maternal
health; 3) Examine the extent to which living in an under-resourced environment or in a state with less
supportive breastfeeding policies moderates the relationship between access to telelactation and breastfeeding
duration and exclusivity among Hispanic and Black individuals. This study explores the effectiveness of
telelactation as a potential solution to improve breastfeeding rates and reduce disparities utilizing a
geographically diverse sample. Findings may inform policy debates about reimbursement of telelactation,
particularly in minoritized populations living in areas lacking traditional breastfeeding support resources."
11010687,"Abstract of funded grant DP1 (5DP1MH132709). Precision editing of neural circuits using engineered electrical
synapses Pioneering approaches including optogenetics and designer receptors exclusively activated by
designer drugs (DREADDs) enable the direct modulation of the activity of individual genetically defined cell types.
Nevertheless, it remains a fundamental challenge to selectively regulate the hallmark feature of neural circuits:
the interface between two specific brain cells. To address this challenge, we have created a new approach,
Long-term integration of circuits using Connexins (LinCx), that employs a novel pair of engineered connexin
hemichannels to directly modulate genetically defined neural circuits. When each member of the hemichannel
pair is expressed in two different cell(s)/cell-types that compose a circuit, they engage in heterotypic docking
(docking with each other) and an electrical synapse is constituted between the two cells. These pair of
hemichannels is engineered 1) to prevent them from engaging in homotypic docking (forming electrical synapses
with themselves), and 2) to disrupt them from docking with other connexin hemichannels endogenously
expressed in the mammalian brain. Finally, 3) the hemichannel pair exhibits rectification. Together, these three
properties confer LinCx with unprecedented spatial-, temporal-, and context precision, enabling the precise
editing of neural circuits. We propose to deploy LinCx across model organisms. We will determine the impact of
LinCx neuromodulation on neural circuit physiology and emotional behavior. We will also test whether LinCx
modulation is sufficient to restore normal behavior in animal models of psychiatric disorders. Successful
completion of these high-risk experiments will yield a new method for long-term circuit editing to regulate
emotional states in preclinical models. In the future, LinCx can be integrated with emerging viral tools that enable
systemic delivery of genetically encoded proteins to specific brain cell-types. Thus, LinCx also has an attainable
path to human translation for ameliorating devastating psychiatric disorders."
11013839,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Mutations in the Transthyretin (TTR) gene can lead to deposition of abnormal amyloid fibrils in the
myocardium, resulting in hereditary transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (hATTR-CM) and leading to heart
failure. Targeted therapies for hATTR-CM have recently been developed and have shown to improve mortality
and hospitalization.
 Recently, we led a study (Journal of American Medical Association, Dec 2019) that showed that the TTR
V122I mutation, commonly observed in racial/ethnic minorities (4% in African Americans (AAs) and 1% in
Hispanic Americans (HAs)), confers two-fold increased risk of heart failure. Despite this strong effect, only 11%
of V122I carriers with heart failure were appropriately diagnosed with hATTR-CM, suggesting marked
underdiagnosis and mis-diagnosis of the disease. We further showed subclinical evidence of
echocardiographic derangements in young, asymptomatic V122I carriers, suggesting early signs can occur
well before onset of disease.
 We propose to extend our prior work by addressing knowledge gaps which are necessary for targeted
therapies to attain their full potential. These include: understanding the incomplete penetrance of V122I;
identifying V122I carriers in large health care systems where genotyping is not common; and understanding
subclinical disease burden. In Aim 1, we will examine the interplay between a polygenic risk score, which are
comprised of millions of single nucleotide variants with small effects, and V122I, a monogenic mutation with a
single strong effect, analyzed in conjunction with clinical risk factors on heart failure in in 6,609 AAs and 9,006
HAs in the BioMe biobank and 5,833 AAs in the Penn Medicine Biobank (PMBB). In Aim 2, we will apply
machine learning tools to multi-modal electronic health record (EHR) data to identify V122I carriers in ~8
million patients from an electronic health record (EHR) data repository at Mount Sinai. In Aim 3, we will
evaluate subclinical effects of amyloid deposition on cardiac structural/functional traits in young, asymptomatic
V122I carriers by recalling V122I carriers for imaging evaluation including research-grade echocardiograms,
cardiac magnetic resonance and technetium nuclear scanning.
 The proposal is innovative because we are utilizing two large diverse ancestry EHR-linked biobanks from
academic health systems (BioMe at Mount Sinai, and PMBB at University of Pennsylvania), along with
adopting cutting-edge methods including multi-ethnic polygenic risk scores, and machine learning approaches
on multi-modal EHR data. We further propose patient recall based on genotypes and perform deep
phenotyping using comprehensive heart imaging scans.
 This proposal has the potential to realize the potential of precision medicine for heart failure in racial/ethnic
minorities by informing clinical care, population management, risk stratification and clinical trials."
11009836,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Scalable interventions that facilitate adherence to HIV PrEP are urgently needed to address the
alarming HIV incidence in Black MSM. In 2020, only 26% of Black MSM in the U.S. used PrEP
even though they represented 40% of HIV diagnoses. There are multi-level barriers to PrEP
adherence among Black MSM, including interpersonal and institutional intersectional stigmas. To
optimize equity in PrEP coverage, Black MSM must have access to service options that reduce
their exposure to these stigmas. Many Men Many Voices (3MV) is a group-level behavioral
intervention that demonstrated efficacy for increasing healthcare seeking behaviors in Black
MSM. Client-centered care coordination (C4) addresses social stigma through a service model
that trains staff to deliver autonomy-supportive care and addresses structural stigma via an
integrated online platform to improve the continuity of coordination between service providers.
Our goal is to combine two evidence-based interventions into a multi-level integrated strategy that
directly addresses interpersonal stigma via 3MV, extends 3MV effects into service-delivery
settings by training staff on key concepts, and then addresses structural stigma by linking men to
a network of services via the online C4 platform. We will pursue the following aims with 2
implementing agencies serving Black MSM: (1) determine the efficacy of an integrated 3MV+ C4
for increasing PrEP adherence; (2) ascertain the optimal dose of C4 implementation for
maximizing its effect on PrEP adherence; (3) identify the critical leverage points in the
implementation ecosystem to target for change. 48 egocentric networks of Black MSM (N=480;
mean network size n=10) will be recruited in Dallas/Ft. Worth and Miami/Ft. Lauderdale. Networks
will all begin with a 3-month control phase and be randomized into either the C4 arm or the
C4+3MV arm. The Learn-as-you-go (LAGO) statistical methodology will be used to optimize the
strategy and associated costs by generating statistical recommendations for modifying pre-
specified components of C4. Qualitative interviews will explore the factors affecting
implementation at scale. Lastly, we will develop a policy brief accounting for the political economy
and non-economic welfare effects of 3MV+C4. This study advances HIV prevention science by
generating evidence for an intervention that will contribute to racial equity in the impact of PrEP
on the HIV epidemic. Our research also uses innovative statistical and interdisciplinary methods
that allow us to maximize 3MV and C4’s effects on adherence by: (1) optimizing elements
observed to be contributing to increases in adherence and (2) streamlining excess elements to
reduce implementation time and costs; thus, enhancing scale-up potential in EHE communities."
11010248,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Asthma is a chronic lung disease of heterogenous etiology affecting nearly 8% of the US population. Failure to
properly treat asthma is associated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality, resulting in over 4,000 deaths
in 2021 and an estimated economic burden over 50 billion dollars in the US. The presence of eosinophils and
their granule product, eosinophil peroxidase (EPX), in airways is associated with asthma type and severity. Yet
there are no commercially available products to accurately measure EPX in the airways to diagnose and
manage asthma in the health care setting. Surrogate methods to define eosinophilic asthma are often too
invasive, expensive, complex, unavailable, or only have low or modest correlation with eosinophil levels in the
airways.
Previously we demonstrated EPX is the most specific protein to identify eosinophils, an important inflammatory
cell in asthma, and developed a gold-standard ELISA assay for EPX detection (EPX-ELISA). We demonstrated
nasal EPX is a surrogate of airway/lung EPX levels. The overall goal of this project is to develop a rapid diagnostic
test (RDT) for the detection of EPX (EPX-RDT) from human nasal swab samples that would provide comparable
values of EPX to that of the existing gold standard EPX-ELISA. Such a test will be able to diagnose and guide
asthma treatment regimens non-invasively from nasal swabs at the point-of-care. Currently there is no such tool
on the market today.
The proposal combines three innovations: (1) Unique pre-validated anti-EPX antibodies (not reproduced in over
twenty years to match our level of validation and sensitivity); (2) Targeting the truly eosinophil-specific protein
(EPX) that ensures we recognize both intact/degranulated eosinophils, and (3) Use of non-invasively collected
nasal swab samples instead of currently used invasive collection methods such as blood, sputum or biopsy. In
Aim 1 of this phase I study we will develop a novel reader integrated test cartridge to quantify EPX levels (EPX-
RDT) device. In Aim 2 we will optimize nasal swab preparation for the EPX-RDT device and use EPX-ELISA as
a correlative predicate. In Aim 3 we will perform validation studies with real-world clinical swab samples from
people with and without asthma. Here the EPX-RDT test will be compared to the predicate EPX-ELISA. The
successful completion of this aim will establish initial clinical performance for the test.
At the conclusion of Phase 1, we will have a functional point-of-care device capable of detecting EPX continuum
in nasal swabs with high precision and accuracy. In Phase 2, the EXP-RDT will be used to conduct clinical studies
to prepare for FDA approval, commercialization, marketing and distribution. The final product will be an easy-to-
use and cost-efficient tool to diagnose and treat asthma non-invasively."
11011191,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Intimate partner violence (IPV) increases the risk of traumatic brain injury (TBI), because the physical assaults
target the head, neck, and face. Women, more than men, across socioeconomic, racial, educational, regional,
and other demographic variables are in harm’s way throughout their life and particularly during pregnancy. When
one partner is pregnant, the frequency and intensity of physical assaults increase and remain focused on the
head, neck, and face. Whether from IPV, falls, or automobile accidents, the consequences of a TBI during
pregnancy (gravida TBI; gTBI) on offspring neuro-development are unknown. Isolated TBI elevates stress and
inflammation, which are known to divert fetal neuro-development with gestational exposure. The proposal goal
is to provide proof-of-concept that gTBI can disturb neurodevelopment, thereby establishing gTBI as an
environmental risk factor for developmental disorders. These studies cannot be performed in people or be
derived from existing databases, thereby warranting laboratory studies. Preliminary data from this research team
showed live births, low male weaning weight, distorted cortical circuity, reduced anxiety and depression, and a
muted immune response principally in male gTBI offspring. These results encourage further investigation of TBI
timing with respect to pregnancy, broader assessment of neuropsychiatric outcomes, enhanced neural circuit
analyses, and molecular investigations of cell and synaptic change. The extent of neurodevelopment disruption
is compared to a standard model of maternal immune activation (MIA) and respective controls. The central
hypothesis of this proposal is that TBI during pregnancy leads to disrupted neurodevelopmental trajectory in the
offspring that includes altered neurobehavioral performance, neurocircuit organization, and cell type-specific
molecular disturbances. To test this hypothesis, a diffuse TBI will be delivered to timed- pregnant mice at 5 and
12 days post-coitum and then follow male and female offspring in terms of: [Aim 1] birth outcomes, offspring
physiology, neurobehavioral phenotype; [Aim 2] neurocircuitry phenotype, and [Aim 3] synaptic protein
expression and cortical cell type-specific gene expression (transcriptomics). Aim 1 will evaluate early post-natal
behaviors; cognition, anxiety, depressive-like, and sensorimotor gating in young adult; and social behaviors in
adult offspring. In Aim 2, cortical and hippocampal synaptic physiology and cortical connectivity will be evaluated
by electrophysiology and laser scanning photostimulation, and aligned with quantitative neuronal morphology.
In Aim 3, western blot quantification of synaptic proteins and cell type-specific transcriptomics inform circuit
development and molecular trajectories. Impact: Successful completion of the proposed studies will provide the
first proof-of-concept that consequences of TBI during pregnancy, often resulting from IPV, can distort
developing brain circuity and determine a neurodevelopmental disorder behavioral phenotype."

Visual perception and visually-guided behavior relies on the ability of the brain to combine information about
multiple aspects of a visual scene. In all sighted animals, including humans, the visual system uses parallel
processing strategies to represent different features of a visual scene in different visual pathways or populations of
neurons. How, then, does the brain combine information about these different aspects of the visual world into a
unified visual percept, and how do animals guide behavior based on multiple visual cues that are encoded by
separate pathways? The research performed under this award will answer this question using the visual system of
the fruit fly Drosophila as a model, which allows for the identification and targeting of precise, defined neural
populations that represent visual cues. This work will: (1) Determine how diverse visual features are jointly
represented by populations of visual projection neurons that carry information from the visual system to the rest
of the brain, (2) Determine how interactions among these visual projection pathways shape the visual information
encoded in them, and (3) Determine how different features of a scene are combined to guide animal behavior. This
work will advance the core mission of the National Eye Institute by making contributions to the understanding of
visual function. This research will rely on a wide array of modern approaches in neuroscience, including functional
imaging of brain activity, genetic manipulations, computational and statistical modeling, and behavioral
measurements. In addition to the research described above, this award will support the awardee’s transition to an
independent research career at a research-intensive university and further support the establishment of their visual
neuroscience laboratory."

Futuros Fuertes 2.0: A primary care-based intervention to prevent obesity in low-income Latino children
 Latino children are at higher risk of obesity and obesity sequelae relative to non-Hispanic white
children. Poverty also increases obesity risk. Disparities in obesity for Latino children emerge in early
childhood; and feeding and sedentary behaviors that increase obesity risk begin in the first two years of life.
Consequently, it is critical to develop and test interventions to prevent obesity among low-income Latino
children beginning in infancy. Primary care provides an ideal setting for obesity prevention among infants and
toddlers given frequent visits in the first two years of life. Incorporating culturally concordant lay health
educators into primary care settings serving diverse, low-income populations is a strategic approach for
leveraging primary care visits to promote healthy behaviors. Furthermore, the use of text messages is a
promising strategy for extending the reach of primary care-based interventions and engaging family members
who do not attend in-person visits. Our team developed and successfully pilot tested Futuros Fuertes 1.0
(Strong Futures), a culturally tailored, primary care-based intervention to prevent obesity in Latino infants and
toddlers. A pilot trial of Futuros Fuertes 1.0 found impact on child health behaviors and BMI z-score and
informed modifications and enhancements leading to Futuros Fuertes 2.0.
 Parents/caregivers receive Futuros Fuertes 2.0 intervention content through: health education and
coaching sessions from a lay health educator, two text messages per week, and environmental prompts. Text
messages are also sent to up to 2 additional family members. Through Futuros Fuertes 2.0, parents are
coached on responsive feeding techniques, foods and beverages that are healthy for their child and those to
avoid, screen time guidelines, and strategies to enhance sleep duration. Our central hypothesis is that a
culturally tailored, primary care-based intervention for low-income Latino parents/caregivers delivered via
health education and coaching sessions in the infant and toddler period and reinforced through text messages
to multiple family caregivers will result in lower BMI at age 2. In Aim 1, we will determine the impact of Futuros
Fuertes 2.0 on children’s BMI and on feeding, screen time and sleep. Low-income Latino infant-
parent/caregiver dyads (n=576) will be recruited from birth to 1 month at two health centers in Northern
California and randomized to: Futuros Fuertes 2.0 or a control intervention. In Aim 2, we will assess mediators
and moderators of intervention effect. In Aim 3, we will use a qualitative approach (semi-structured interviews)
to understand parent and provider experiences with the Futuros Fuertes 2.0 intervention. The Futuros Fuertes
2.0 model may improve feeding, screen time and sleep behaviors among low-income Latino children and
therefore has the potential for lowering their lifetime risk of obesity and metabolic complications."

Training creative and productive investigators in gastrointestinal research is the central mission of our program.
Emerging discoveries in human genetics, epigenetics, molecular and cellular biology, single cell sequencing
technologies, microbiology, immunology, and epidemiology have had major impacts on the understanding of
pathophysiology of gastrointestinal diseases. Accordingly, our T32 program is focused on training MD,
MD/PhD, and PhD investigators in basic and clinical research in the pathophysiology of GI diseases. During
This funding cycle, we have successfully recruited investigators from diverse personal and professional
backgrounds. This supplement is intended to provide support for one of these talented trainees."
11017967,"SUMMARY The four lead investigators of this project have assembled ~10,000 patients with focal and
segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS). With this largest
ever FSGS/NS cohort assembled, the vast majority whom have already undergone genome-wide sequencing,
we propose a collaborative effort to understand the genetic basis of this disease. The increasing number of
identified genes that can cause FSGS/SRNS when altered shows that these phenotypes are genetically highly
complex. Understanding the genetic basis of FSGS and NS is important: (1) Work to date has been the major
driver in understanding the molecular structure of the glomerulus; (2) Genetic diagnosis affects therapy: some
mutations predict lack of response to steroid therapies, others predict response to nutritional supplementation;
(3) Genetics affects renal transplant planning and outcome. Major gaps remain: (1) Most FSGS/NS cases still
are genetically unresolved; (2) The basis of disease is complex and involves the contribution of different
variants across the spectrum of allelic frequency and penetrance; (3) Our ability to declare genetic causality at
the single-patient level is limited; (4) Therapeutic options are limited. Thus, we will use this large cohort and
new analytic methods to address these gaps. We will functionally characterize many of the new alleles and
new FSGS genes that we discover. We will develop and distribute reagents, including patient-derived iPS cells.
We will create a database by aggregating exome and genome sequencing data from our patients, and make
this data available via web browser to assist the research community. We plan to: Aim 1: Understand the
spectrum of rare genetic variation that causes (or increases risk of) FSGS and NS in humans. By leveraging
large sample sizes, we can use approaches that are not otherwise powerful enough for disease gene
identification. We will discover novel genes associated with FSGS/NS to identify highly penetrant variants
(including burden tests of rare sequence changes and copy-number variants), define the spectrum of SNV and
structural variants in known FSGS/NS genes, and identify glomerular genes co-expressed with disease-related
genes. Aim 2: Define functional effects of disease-associated variants. We will test effects of
variants/mutations in cell-based assays, develop new zebrafish models by mutating FSGS/NS genes, and
generate a panel of iPS cells from patients with FSGS/NS-associated mutations. Aim 3: We will bring together
all of our genotyping data, generated from SNP arrays, WES, and WGS, to build and maintain a publicly
available variant browser, the “Nephrotic Syndrome Genomic Portal” (NSGP). NSGP will include allele
frequency data, functional classification, and clinical correlates for FSGS/NS. We will summarize, at a site-
level, SNVs, insertion-deletions, structural variants (CNV) observed in our FSGS/NS cohort and provide quality
metrics of variants reported. NSGP will also have the capability to accept and incorporate data from other
investigators and clinical genetics laboratories."

Adults with obesity have increased myeloid inflammatory responses that associate with cardiovascular and
metabolic disease. There are several gaps, though, in our current understanding of metabolic inflammation
(meta-inflammation) including our understanding of initiating changes in myelopoiesis and regulated changes
in myeloid cells. It is clear that some individuals develop a meta-inflammatory response placing them at higher
risk for metabolic impairment while others are protected. While it is clinically important to identify adolescents
at risk for future disease, we do not understand how to use meta-inflammatory markers to assess disease risk.
Our previous human and mouse studies demonstrate that individuals who expand inflammatory monocytes in
response to obesogenic diets are at greatest risk for metabolic disease. Based on the ability of these
monocytes to generate an inflammatory response, traffic to tissues and differentiate into inflammatory tissue
macrophages promoting insulin resistance, we are terming them meta-inflammatory monocytes (MiMo). Given
that animal models and clinical studies have demonstrated that myeloid inflammation with circulating cytokines,
enhanced circulating myeloid cells and tissue inflammation are linked with insulin resistance it is critical to
understand if these same mechanisms exist in adolescents and can differentiate who is at risk for future
metabolic disease. The goals of the primary proposal investigate the central hypothesis that adolescents at
risk for metabolic disease have an increase in MiMos and enhanced MiMo recruitment, cytokine secretion and
macrophage polarization leading to insulin resistance. We will evaluate this hypothesis in three aims: Aim 1)
To define the monocyte transcriptomic signatures associated with metabolic disease in adolescents. Aim 2) To
determine high risk and low risk monocyte phenotypes produced in adolescents with metabolic impairment.
Aim 3) To assess meta-inflammatory monocyte activation and metabolism in response to dietary fatty acid
stimulation. This supplement keeps with the same primary goals of the project but would allow us to expand
the inclusion of gender minority adolescents with gender dysphoria on post-pubertal sex hormone modulating
therapies. This will further the translation of our findings to these clinical populations of adolescents."
11023229,"Project Summary
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common diagnosed adult leukemia, the median age of patients with
AML is about 70 years. Although the prognosis for younger adults with AML has improved during the last four
decades, there has been little progress in the treatment of older adults. Currently, approximately 90% of adults
with AML over the age of 55 will die due to resistance to therapy, relapse, or complications from harsh treatments
such as chemotherapy. AML disease progression is heavily influenced by supportive cells in the tumor
microenvironment. Bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs) are an instrumental extrinsic component
to normal hematopoiesis which are hijacked by leukemic cells in the process of leukemia development. Based
on AML being mainly a disease of older adults and evidence of an accelerated aging phenotype in the (BM)
microenvironment of AML, this proposal aims to investigate the role of aging and senescence in AML disease
progression and to ultimately identify therapeutic targets and eliminate the leukemia-supportive aging phenotype
in the BM. Although epigenetic aging and senescence are two distinct but parallel mechanisms of aging, they
have been shown to converge where certain triggers of senescence can affect epigenetic age. The molecular
basis for age-related alterations in AML-derived BMSCs are poorly described and if deciphered, could have
significant implication on both the prevention and treatment of elderly AML. Moreover, the correlation of
epigenetic age in cells of the AML tumor microenvironment with outcome has not been examined. Thus, the
specific aims of this proposal are to (1) examine epigenetic, transcriptional and phenotypic differences in BMSCs
derived from AML patients, compared to age matched control BSMCs, enabled by the use of methylation studies,
sequencing, mass cytometry and biochemical assays (2) determine the epigenetic age via methylation analysis
of different components of the tumor microenvironment (T-cells, tumor cells and BMSC cells) in AML patient
samples and correlate with disease outcome and finally, (3) utilize findings and techniques developed in aim 1
and 2 to study the status of epigenetic aging and senescence in in vitro and in vivo models of accelerated aging
and relapse to determine if they can be therapeutically targeted. The completion of this work will potentially
provide a quantitative measure of senescence in elderly AML patients, further enhance risk stratification, and
will help identify novel age-related targets in AML-BMSC with potential to lead to development of new therapies."

 In this phase 2b SBIR, we aim to support caregivers of Persons with Memory Concerns (PWMC) through
development of an informatics system to both increase PWMC social engagement and promote care
coordination. Based on positive response from our completed phase 2 project, the new phase 2b will deploy an
augmented version of our Social Reminder System app technology, adding new features suggested by
participants in our phase 2 randomized control trial and qualitative interviews with users. The new Social
Reminder System will focus on decreasing caregiver stress and care burden with features to make the system
more mobile and allow for remote monitoring of PWMC by caregivers. More than a third of older adults - and
more than 25% of older adults with memory concerns - do not live with their care provider. There are more
than 14 million older adults that may be at an increased risk of social isolation and when coupled with memory
concerns, may face potentially hazardous safety risks. Even co-resident care providers who work or spend
time away from home may face elevated risk due to episodic absences and having to share care
responsibilities with a broad network of friends and family. These issues have been shown to lead to elevated
care burden, elevated stress levels for care providers, and premature nursing home placement. Tech-enabled
reminder systems can increase social interaction and promote care coordination, but often face barriers to
uptake due to older adults’ documented reservations with technology engagement. Our next-generation social
reminder system will run on a tablet computer and is designed to promote social engagement and ease
caregiver burden for care providers. Modifications are designed to enhance (1) uptake and ease-of-use by
older adult’s care providers and PWMC, (2) tools to promote social engagement for PWMC, (3) remote
monitoring, and (4) care coordination care by care providers. Ease-of-use: Tablets will automatically connect to
caregiver approved trusted circle members’ cell phones. Social connection: reminders will now include both
social and care support service visitors. The new system will also provide a two-phase reminder system: one
before the visit and a separate reminder during the visit. The system will also allow trusted circle members to
record a standing message that plays prior to arrival (e.g., for standing appointments and care services), or a
one-time message stating the name of the visitor and the purpose of the visit. Care coordination: the system
will designate a care provider who will receive notifications for any cell phones with the free app that comes
within range of the PWMC’s tablet. This will allow caregivers to monitor all visitors to PWMCs (social,
scheduled care, and medical services). We further include a feature that allows visitors to set reminders for
caregivers for (1) upcoming visits, (2) upcoming medical appointments, or (3) any notes from medical visits.
Location information will now be a part of the system. The caregiver will be able to use their care coordination
app to monitor if the PWMC has been taken to an appointment. Remote monitoring: To enhance security, the
system will retain a log of all visitors - which will allow tracking any package deliveries or solicitations - and will
retain a log of all visitors."
11009218,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
People with HIV (PWH) experience a heightened risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) that is
attributed, in part, to chronic inflammation. Lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]), a non-traditional ASCVD risk factor is the major
carrier of oxidized phospholipids, which are increased in pro-inflammatory states and which damage vascular
cells at the vessel//lumen interface. Identifying Lp(a) risk thresholds, the increment in ASCVD risk for a given
increment in Lp(a), would improve risk prediction and inform entry criteria and treatment goals for future Lp(a)
lowering therapies in PWH. Our project defines Lp(a) risk thresholds in PWH, explores two possible responsible
mechanisms for Lp(a) risk in PWH, and studies regulation of hepatic Lp(a) production in PWH through the
inflammatory cytokine IL-6 signaling pathway using sera from PWH. The study results will address critical
knowledge gaps and test specific hypotheses related to the Lp(a) associated heightened ASCVD risk in PWH.
Aim One utilizes serial coronary and carotid studies of subclinical ASCVD in the MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort
Study (MWCCS) cohorts and biospecimens to establish Lp(a)-specific ASCVD risk thresholds in PWH. We will
also explore racial disparities as Lp(a) levels in healthy Black people are higher than in healthy White people.
Aim Two explores two mechanisms that may explain an association between Lp(a) and the HIV-specific
heightened ASCVD risk. The first examines whether Lp(a) is associated with impaired coronary endothelial
vascular function, a driver of ASCVD. It uses non-invasive MRI to assess endothelial-dependent coronary
function in newly recruited PWH and PWoH. The second measures the association of Lp(a) with coronary
vascular inflammation, another driver of ASCVD pathogenesis, using the validated fat attenuation index
developed at Oxford University to measure coronary inflammation from MWCCS coronary CT scans.
Aim Three examines regulation of Lp(a) production in PWH, a poorly understood aspect of ASCVD risk in PWH.
Our preliminary in vitro cell data suggest that the inflammatory cytokine IL-6, known to be elevated in PWH and
associated with ASCVD, enhances hepatocyte LPA transcriptional activity via the JAK-STAT pathway. Moreover,
the genetic variant rs56393506, known to amplify Lp(a) production, will be studied. We will utilize induced
pluripotent stem cell-derived hepatocytes exposed to sera from PWH to examine IL-6 signaling pathways of
hepatic Lp(a) production. Additionally, we will utilize the exisitng MWCCS genomics dataset to assess whether
known variants linked to Lp(a) identified in published GWAS are associated with the higher Lp(a) levels in PWH.
In summary, this comprehensive research identifies Lp(a)-specific ASCVD risk thresholds in PWH by leveraging
data from the MWCCS cohorts, studies two mechanisms that may explain why Lp(a) is associated with this risk,
as well as pathways of hepatic regulation of Lp(a) production in PWH. We expect the results will increase
understanding of the role of Lp(a) in the HIV-specific heightened ASCVD risk and inform Lp(a) treatment goals
with Lp(a) directed therapies in this high risk patient population."

Adolescent girls and young women (AGYW; ages 15-24) in sub-Saharan Africa face the dual threats of HIV
infection and unintended pregnancy that severely undermine their long-term wellbeing. However, despite the
urgent need to reach AGYW with sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services, health systems are often ill
equipped to overcome the numerous barriers to health care services faced by AGYW. We have successfully
piloted and are now in the process of evaluating the effectiveness (in an ongoing cluster randomized controlled
trial) of Malkia Klabu (MK), a loyalty program intervention that creates AGYW-friendly drug shops where
AGYW can access HIV prevention services and contraception. The motivation for this approach is the growing
recognition that drug shops, which are widely distributed and vastly outnumber health facilities, can promote
beneficial health behaviors, bridge gaps in health services, and mitigate health workforce shortages. Though
HIV testing is the gateway to HIV prevention and care, and self-testing with oral fluid holds promise for
overcoming many of these obstacles, neither are widely accessible to AGYW. The goal of this proposed study
is to build on the success of MK and move towards sustainability and scale-up, identify the critical supply-side
features drug shops need to help independently sustain the MK demand-generating AGYW intervention,
including HIVST kit distribution, following a fully subsidized research period.
We therefore propose to extend our implementation-effectiveness trial study period and additionally test
program adoption, implementation, and maintenance. To do so, we will emulate real-world market
conditions by implementing shop-initiated HIVST procurement, phasing out HIVST kit subsidies (from 100% to
0), and testing continuation of 2 financing models for MK product reimbursements—fully reimbursable
(government-supported scenario) vs none (fully privately supported scenario). After co-designing prosocial
motivational pitches with our Pharmacy Advisory Board, we will test adoption and continuation of MK in control
and intervention shops currently enrolled in our ongoing effectiveness trial, respectively, for 3 months (Aim 1),
and maintenance by gradually phasing out subsidies of shop-initiated HIVST kit procurement over the next 36
months; without HIVST kit subsidies in the last phase, continuation will be tested by comparing fully
reimbursed vs. fully shop-financed MK product distribution (Aim 2); mixed methods data will assess
implementation, fidelity, receptivity, behavior change pathways, and motivational contexts for understanding
shopkeeper engagement (Aim 3). At the end of the study, we will be well-positioned to inform our MOH and
Pharmacy Council partners how best to scale MK under different HIVST kit subsidy levels and MK product
reimbursement models. Importantly, our study will contribute to generalizable learning about the structures
required for commercially sustainable public-private partnerships for high-impact public health interventions."
11013972,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Enhancers are an important class of noncoding loci regulating gene expression and play important roles in
modulating diverse phenotypes and disease states. However, our understanding of the role of enhancers in
phenotypic evolution is limited and we lack a detailed understanding of the relationship between sequence
change within and between species, epigenetic states and variation in enhancer function. Moreover, we have
few statistical models that allow researchers to connect evolutionary changes in enhancer sequences within
and between species to phenotypic variation, and we often cannot unambiguously determine the causes of
observed changes in evolutionary rate of enhancers along lineages. Finally, most studies of enhancer
evolution thus far have studied only small numbers of enhancers and genome-wide assays of enhancer
variation and function are rare. Here we propose to develop statistical models linking phylogenetic patterns of
enhancer evolution with phenotypic variation between species, and to leverage within-species variation across
multiple species – “comparative population genomics” – to disentangle the sources of rate changes observed
in enhancers across species. We will also functionally test diverse enhancers on a large-scale, using the
developing fore- and hindlimb of volant and flightless birds as a model of development and gene expression.
Specifically, in Aim 1 we will extend a recently developed Bayesian phylogenetic model for detecting rate
changes in noncoding DNA, phyloAcc, to improve its biological realism by incorporating stochastic gene tree
heterogeneity and the ability to associate sequence change with both binary and continuous traits. Building on
a novel data set of comparative gene expression and chromatin states across multiple species and
developmental stages, we will also develop methods to associate genome-wide variation in chromatin states
between species with binary and continuous traits. In Aim 2 we will develop additional statistical models to
leverage information from sequence variation within species to better understand the evolutionary forces
contributing to rate variation in noncoding DNA observed between species. The models developed in Aims 1
and 2 will be refined and made available to the broader community in a user-friendly format for use on diverse
systems and species. In Aim 3 we will functionally validate large numbers of candidate enhancers identified in
Aims 1 and 2 as having evolved new functions or found in altered chromatin states in the developing fore- and
hindlimb of volant and flightless birds. Using high-throughput assays in chicken, emu and other birds we will
study the relationship between within- and between-species sequence variation of enhancers and their ability
to drive gene expression. Together these aims will provide a number of tools that will benefit the community of
researchers using comparative genomics to understand links between genotype and phenotype, and will
extend the kinds of phenotypic traits and genomic signatures that will inform this emerging paradigm."
11014021,"Sepsis, which is characterized by life threatening organ dysfunction caused by an uncontrolled host response to
infection, is the leading cause of death in hospitals and is responsible for >250,000 deaths per year in the U.S.
at the cost of over $20 billion in patient care. Sepsis has a mortality rate nearing 50% at 2 years, which has
profound implications for patients recovering from severe COVID-19, a form of viral sepsis. Because sepsis is a
multi-organ disease, the quantification of circulating proteins and metabolites is central to the profiling of sepsis
and of its long-term effects, and some such assays (lactate, procalcitonin) have become the standard of care.
To date, the majority of studies, and particularly the large number in COVID-19 sepsis, have profiled plasma and
serum, which, compared to whole blood is fraught with variability and belies the important roles of the erythrocyte
and other cell-types. To this end, biorepositories at Duke University, which are banking samples from COVID-
19 sepsis patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) and in a post-COVID outpatient clinic, have been utilizing
volumetric absorptive microsampling (VAMS) on Neoteryx Mitra tips to collect and store whole blood specimens
for future ‘omic analyses. The overarching goals of this application are to develop and validate multiomic methods
for mass spectrometry-based quantification of proteins and metabolites from Mitra tips that comprehensively
profile sepsis pathobiology. In the R21 phase, we will develop and validate mass spectrometry-based methods
for the non-targeted quantification of proteins and post-translational modifications (phosphorylation,
glycosylation) in whole blood, and for targeted quantification of numerous metabolite classes. We will develop
reference materials and standard operating procedures for inter-laboratory translation of these approaches. In
the R33 phase, we will analyze proteins, PTMs and metabolites from over 600 patient timepoints from
biorepositories containing longitudinal samples in critically ill sepsis and post-COVID-19 cohorts, and we will
integrate these data with well-curated clinical datasets. Completion of these aims will establish the utility of blood
sampling by VAMS for future sepsis studies and will create a highly curated clinical and deep multiomic dataset
for future hypothesis generation."
11014022,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Sepsis is broadly defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by infection. However, the experience of
sepsis varies widely between individuals and within individuals. Such inter- and intra-individual heterogeneity
reflects complex, evolving pathobiology induced by host-pathogen interactions and modified by pre-existing
patient characteristics and ongoing medical treatments. It is highly unlikely that a single—or even a small
panel—of biomarkers will characterize an individual’s pathobiology with enough accuracy to unlock precision
medicine approaches in sepsis. The challenge, therefore, is to identify and accurately characterize relevant
phenotypes of sepsis and develop enrichment strategies to design and test novel targeted therapies. For this
project, we propose testing the feasibility of novel approaches to collect, process, and analyze biologic data
representing the immuno-inflammatory-metabolic response to infection early in the sepsis course and link this
information to relevant organ dysfunction-based phenotype data from the electronic health record (EHR).
We have assembled a multi-disciplinary team composed of experts in translational immunology, pediatric
emergency medicine, critical care, and data science. We will test the feasibility of collecting and processing
blood samples of different volumes for deep phenotyping at the pre-resuscitation phase, which is a critical
timepoint, as well as 48 hours later to capture dynamic changes post-resuscitation. We will use these samples
to characterize the functional immuno-inflammatory-metabolic biology using high dimensional flow cytometry to
track surface and intracellular markers of lymphocyte proliferation, apoptosis, exhaustion, and cytokine
production. In addition, we will extend flow cytometric techniques to perform bioenergetic evaluation, and will
perform proteomic evaluation of the plasma immuno-inflammatory-metabolomic response using O-link.
This project will take advantage of extensive clinical research infrastructure at the three study sites. In
addition, the investigators will have access to innovative biologic assays at CHOP which will allow our
collaborative team to glean key biologic phenotypes from critically ill and complex patients. In the R21 phase,
we will complete a single-center pilot study to test the feasibility of collecting, processing, and analyzing the
optimal blood specimens for deep phenotyping in the early phase of sepsis, linking them to the EHR registry
data, and developing and testing a data pipeline to characterize the patients’ organ dysfunction-based clinical
phenotypes. In the R33 phase, we will expand the sample collection to three sites and perform a proof-of-
concept analysis to determine if there are differences in the immuno-inflammatory-metabolomic patterns of the
children who develop either of the high-risk organ dysfunction-based sepsis phenotypes. Identifying relevant
biological patterns in the R33 phase can then lead to future hypothesis-driven mechanistic studies and the
development of targeted therapies."

We study neurofibromas, benign peripheral nerve tumors characteristic of patients with the common dominantly
inherited disease neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). In the 30-year history of this project we have developed cell
and animal models and studied many of the cell types that are recruited to neurofibromas: neurofibroma cells
include Schwann cells (SC), which we now know are outnumbered by a combination of fibroblasts,
macrophages, and other immune cells. We use a neurofibroma mouse model in which, in the peripheral nervous
system, biallelic Nf1 mutations are present only in Schwann cell precursors (SCP) and Schwann cells; other wild
type stromal and immune cells are recruited to neurofibromas as they form. We showed that neurofibroma SC
and SCP express CXCL10, whose receptor, CXCR3, is expressed on immune cells-- T cells and dendritic cells
(DC)-- and that CXCR3 is required for neurofibroma formation. Further, we observed a strong interferon
signature in SC and neurofibroma macrophages; interferons are known to stimulate the production of CXCL10
and of CXCL9, chemokines that signal through CXCR3. Our striking Preliminary Data show that neurofibromas
require T cells to form, that transfer of T cells back to mice lacking them is sufficient to promote neurofibromas.
Mice deficient in a key type of APC, dendritic cells (DCs), also show reduced neurofibroma numbers. Finally,
immune cells are known to secrete factors that influence appear to promote Nf1-/- SCP self-renewal and
neurofibroma formation. Based on these observations we propose that: (i) Schwann cells/SCP require type I IFN
signaling to produce CXCL10 to recruit DCs and T cells. (ii) subset(s) of DCs stimulate tumor-specific T cells to
produce IFN-g, which induces Cxcl9 expression by macrophages. (iii) Cxcl9/10 act redundantly to sustain T cell
recruitment; and (iv) cytokines produced by immune cells themselves promote SC de-differentiation and
neurofibroma development, in a feed-forward loop."

Urban Native American communities experience significant and persistent disparities in cardiovascular
diseases, obesity and diabetes, and their preventable behavioral precursors, diet and physical activity. This
study implements two multi-level evidence-based interventions (EBIs) Minnesota NET-Works and Stanford
GOALS in partnership with six American Indian after school programs and community-serving organizations in
the Minneapolis, St Paul and Duluth Minnesota. Adoption and maintenance of these programs can be
enhanced and effectiveness strengthened through a structured, evidence-based participatory approach that
tailors the interventions to meet the cultural, organizational contextual, and broader socioeconomic context and
incorporates local innovations. This proposal is poised to achieve these goals through a community-based
participatory research (CBPR).Coalition including the healthcare provider Minneapolis Native American
Community Clinic (NACC, primary care system), Minneapolis and St Paul and Duluth Minnesota School
Districts' Indian Education after school programs (school system), the social service provider Division of Indian
Work's Family Spirit Home Visitation program (social service provider system), departments of public health
and University of Minnesota researchers. The Coalition will use the evidence-based 10-step Getting to
Outcomes (GTO) tailoring and implementation approach to enhance implementation fidelity, reach and
acceptance, and sustainability among the after school programs and community-serving organizations. Native
American organization leadership and program delivery staff will receive mentoring and training in the tailored
EBI curricula and in effective implementation strategies. Implementation strategy effectiveness will be
assessed using a stepped wedge study design. The study uses the Social Ecological Model as its multilevel
intervention framework, and RE-AIM as its implementation process evaluation measurement framework.
Implementation outcomes include organizational leadership support, staff implementation capacity, and
intervention fidelity (program reach, intervention content, delivery, receipt and dose). An important innovative
aspect of the proposed research is its use of evidence-based implementation strategies to strengthen the
capacity of the programs and staff to implement the interventions with broad reach, high participation, and
strong fidelity by aligning with local culture and context. The proposed project will use proven effective
implementation strategies to build program organizational leadership and program delivery staff
implementation capacity to successfully engage urban Native American families in strengths-based, culturally-
grounded programs to promote youth physical activity and healthy eating. Sustained program engagement
among urban Native American families will promote healthy eating and physical activity behaviors that will
reduce future cardiovascular disease risk in this highly burdened community."
11010721,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT
Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), the deliberate destruction of one’s own body tissue without suicidal intent, is
alarmingly common in adolescents, and a risk factor for suicide attempts and deaths. NSSI typically emerges
in adolescence, when brain networks supporting self-regulation, such as the cognitive control network, are
still maturing, thus dysfunctional brain networks may underlie NSSI risk in adolescents. This project will
leverage data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, including baseline MRI data
collected when youth are aged 9-10 years, to identify brain network abnormalities in youth who develop
NSSI two or more years later. Our analyses will be performed on multimodal MRI data and focus on two
major intrinsic functional brain networks. These are the salience network, involved in emotion, and implicated
in previous studies of NSSI, and the cognitive control network, important for emotion regulation, yet less
comprehensively studied in NSSI. Our central hypothesis is that youth who develop NSSI have enhanced
activity and integrity of the salience network and reduced activity and integrity of the cognitive control
network compared to a sample of individually matched controls without NSSI. We propose a cross-sectional
analysis of MRI data from baseline, in youth who develop NSSI for the first time (and with no history of
suicidal ideation or attempt) at year 2 or later. At Year 2, N=141 (68 males) youths met our NSSI criteria.
The number of males means this will be the first neuroimaging study with sufficient males to analyze sex
differences. Based on community prevalence, we conservatively estimate that 560 youth will meet our NSSI
group inclusion criteria by Year 6 (R01 Year 3), for a total sample size of 1120. Aim 1 will investigate fMRI
tasks that measure salience network (an emotional N-back task) and cognitive control network (a Stop
Signal task) function. We will also study connectivity of these networks during different task conditions using
psychophysiological interaction analysis. Aim 2 will investigate the structural integrity of the salience and
cognitive control networks by analyzing diffusion imaging to study white matter, and T1-weighted MRI to
measure cortical thickness and amygdala shape and volume. Aim 3 will investigate the potential modifying
influence of parental history of depression and of school environmental factors on the relationship between
brain structure and function, and NSSI risk. An exploratory sub-aim will identify whether earlier age of onset
of NSSI is associated with stronger network effects on risk for NSSI. By studying brain networks prior to
NSSI onset, this study has promise for identifying biological targets that could be used in experimental
therapeutics treatment development, such as pharmacological or neuromodulatory therapeutics. These
could reduce the harmful physical and psychological effects of NSSI on individuals and their loved ones, and
prevent future deaths by suicide."
11008761,"Abstract
Cervical cancer deaths have dramatically fallen in high-income countries, but cervical cancer remains one of
the leading causes of cancer deaths in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Cervical cancer accounted
for 341,800 deaths in 2020, with approximately 90% of these deaths occurring in LMICs. Treatments for
precancerous lesions are highly effective for preventing cancer progression if identified and treated early.
However, most LMICs and low-resource clinics that offer cervical cancer screening lack accessible treatment
services, which means referral of patients to larger hospitals, leading to loss of follow up and disease progression
to cancer. While loop electrosurgical excision procedure is the gold standard in the treatment of lesions, it
requires highly trained clinicians and an operating environment rarely found in LMIC clinics. The World Health
Organization recommends cryotherapy for cervical precancer treatment in LMICs, but the key drawback for
current cryotherapy systems is their dependence on consumable cryogen gas. Access to a cryogen gas supply
is unreliable, consumable gas costs are high, and heavy and bulky gas cylinders limit portability to remote clinics.
Other LMIC-targeted options have been attempted, but they were poorly adopted due to high cost and
discontinued manufacturer support (CryoPen) or insufficient depth of tissue necrosis for fully effective treatment
(heat-based thermal ablation). Taken together, no single system exists to provide an appropriate and cost-
effective solution that is suitable for widespread LMIC use. With an LMIC-appropriate treatment solution, cervical
cancer mortality could be reduced by 33% (~300,000 deaths) by 2030. In this Phase II SBIR proposal, and in
response to NCI’s Notice of Special Interest (NOT-CA-21-062), Ananya Health is developing the CRCL System,
a portable, affordable battery-powered, closed-loop cryotherapy system for the treatment of cervical
precancerous lesions in LMICs. By recirculating the cryogen fluid in a closed-loop system, the CRCL System
does not require consumable cryogen gas. The rechargeable battery allows for treatment independent of
electrical grid availability. Completion of all Phase I milestones established that (1) cryotherapy temperatures
can be achieved in closed-loop system without consumable gases and (2) a validated list of User Needs and
design inputs will drive the development of our CRCL device. In Phase II, first, we will finalize the CRCL design
and verify that it meets all design inputs through in vivo animal study and non-clinical evaluations with production-
equivalent test units (Aim 1). Then, we will confirm that the CRCL design meets usability and human factor
requirements through simulated benchtop design validation by gynecologists and lower-level healthcare
providers in the US and LMICs (Aim 2). Finally, we will test CRCL with a variety of IEC 60601-1, cleaning
validation, and biocompatibility testing to confirm the design is safe and can withstand a range of environmental
and use conditions (Aim 3). The completion of Phase II milestones will culminate in an FDA 510(k) submission
and clearance, which will be leveraged for regulatory approval in our Kenya beachhead market."

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is among the leading causes of death and disability worldwide with the number of
patients in the US estimated to reach 16 million by 2050, associated with an annual cost of care projected to
reach $1.1 trillion. Vascular contributions to dementia contribute to the pathogenesis of AD and directly cause
vascular dementia, the primary AD-related dementia (ADRD). Presently, vascular dementia cannot be reliably
diagnosed without costly MRI studies and detailed imaging analysis. There is a pressing need to develop better
diagnostic tools, particularly those that target the vascular contributions to dementia in order to value the
contribution of vascular injury in establishing a dementia diagnosis. In addition, improving the ability to
discriminate between AD and vascular dementia can directly inform prognosis and treatment plans. The goal of
the proposed studies is to develop and validate a novel, minimally invasive diagnostic assay to discriminate AD
from vascular dementia. Sage Cerebrovascular Diagnostics has developed a panel-based diagnostic assay
incorporating six interconnected inflammatory molecules that preliminary data indicate can reliably detect the
presence of cerebrovascular injury. This panel-based assay to detect silent cerebrovascular injury using a
capture-detection immunoassay on the Luminex platform is technically reliable and reproducible across
populations using a log-normalized, population mean-adjusted composite scoring approach. These diagnostic
biomarkers for silent brain injury (SageSignalTM at-home test assay) are increased in individuals with
cerebrovascular risk factors for dementia including hypertension, diabetes, and stroke. Further, SageSignalTM
at-home test assay results are sensitive for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) metrics of both early and late
cerebrovascular damage as demonstrated on MRI. With extensive data indicating a link between inflammation
and cerebrovascular injury, the SageSignalTM at-home test assay is ready for diagnostic validation as a novel
biomarker with utility in the diagnosis of AD and ADRDs. Here, we propose studies to validate the robustness of
the SageSignalTM at-home test assay in the CLIA lab environment with establishment of pre-analytic, analytic,
and post-analytic performance characteristics (Aim 1), identify the optimal at-home collection methodology (Aim
2), and determine the sensitivity and specificity of the assay for vascular brain injury using clear pre-specific
milestones to judge diagnostic accuracy (Aim 3). The proposed project will demonstrate that SageSignalTM at-
home test can function as a sensitive and specific innovative diagnostic tool to improve the detection and
stratification of individuals with cognitive impairment due to vascular damage to the brain. At the successful
conclusion of this Phase I SBIR, we will have a novel and minimally invasive biomarker test ready for subsequent
clinical prospective validation to identify individuals at risk for vascular cognitive impairment and discriminate
between individuals with different subtypes of dementia. This will not only advance the care of AD/ADRD and
expand the tools available to providers to reduce the overall burden of dementia while biologic insights."

Overactive bladder (OAB) is a prevalent and costly health condition that poses a significant public health burden
in the United States. It is well established that OAB disproportionately affects women. Studies have reported up
to 43% of women over 40 and nearly 50% of women over 65 are affected by OAB across. Recent studies have
focused on the bladder health disparities experienced by Hispanic/Latina women. These studies found that
Hispanic women had the highest prevalence of OAB and urinary incontinence (UI) than other racial/ethnic
groups. OAB behavioral therapy (BT) is a highly efficacious, low-risk treatment option that can significantly
improve overall quality of life and is recommended by The American Urological Association as a first line therapy
for OAB. However, OAB BT in clinical practice varies widely depending on insurance coverage, practice care
management processes, and patient access/availability, especially in the Latin/Hispanic community. Remotely
delivered culturally relevant and technology-supported preventive health interventions offer a viable technique
for increasing OAB symptom awareness and self-management practices among Latina women. The CeCe App
is a novel, conversational agent-based application for delivering validated, patient-centered education and
coaching targeted to women with symptoms of OAB. CeCe allows its users to learn about their condition and
manage their symptoms. A usable and accessible, evidence-based application like CeCe can be used to help
U.S. Latina/e women overcome the barriers to OAB care that they face by educating them on how to improve
their OAB symptoms. Therefore, in this study we seek to culturally adapt OAB CeCe for Latina women in the US
to better address the specific obstacles faced in achieving positive OAB outcomes. To do this, we will need to
assess the bladder and pelvic floor health understanding of Latina women through understanding the cultural
challenges, nuances and specific language and voice necessary to adapt this product for Latina/e women (Aim
1). Then, the CeCe App will be culturally and linguistically adapted for US Latina/e women (Aim 2), and lastly,
assessing early-stage acceptability of the culturally & linguistically adapted OAB CeCe App (Aim 3). This new
version of the CeCe App will lead to increased accessibility & availability of OAB BT, improved patient adherence
and improved OAB symptoms and quality of life among the Latin/Hispanic female community."
11014024,"Project Summary/Abstract
Microbial communities inhabit nearly all environments on earth, including the human body, where they can
influence health in myriad ways. These communities are often composed of hundreds or more species that form
networks of metabolic interactions. Because metabolic interactions are complex and difficult to study at a
molecular level, my research program focuses on interactions involving one family of metabolites – corrinoid
cofactors – as a model to understand metabolic interactions among bacteria. Corrinoids are the vitamin B12 family
of cobalt-containing metabolites that are used as enzyme cofactors for a variety of reactions. Corrinoids, like
many amino acids, nucleobases, and other cofactors, are synthesized by only a fraction of bacteria that use
them, and therefore are considered to be shared metabolites. Corrinoids are unique in their structural diversity,
with over a dozen different forms discovered and up to eight of these forms found in microbial community
samples, including the human gut. This structural diversity is a significant factor in microbial interactions because
most bacteria are selective in the corrinoids they can use. The hypothesis driving this work is that structurally
distinct corrinoids can be used as handles to manipulate microbial communities. Our previous NIGMS-funded
research has laid the groundwork for the proposed research by establishing experimental methods; discovering
and characterizing new genes; investigating corrinoid selectivity in enzymes, riboswitches, and bacteria; and
creating a bioinformatic pipeline to predict corrinoid metabolism in bacteria. Our long-term vision is to build on
this foundation to generate a newly detailed understanding of microbial community interactions through the study
of corrinoids across scales, from molecular mechanisms to whole community perturbations. We will achieve this
goal by (1) identifying genome sequence signatures predictive of bacterial corrinoid preferences in corrinoid-
dependent enzymes and riboswitches, with an emphasis on evolutionary approaches and (2) investigating the
molecular basis of corrinoid-dependent community dynamics by applying sequencing, culture-dependent, and
genetic approaches to a model human gut-derived enrichment culture. As a test of our ability to understand and
predict corrinoid-based metabolism and community dynamics, we will design and build bacterial strains with
corrinoid-dependent metabolic networks, as well as consortia of bacteria with predictable dynamics. This
research will be accomplished by using a combination of genetics, biochemistry, microbiology, and
bioinformatics, building upon the past research of my group. Our work on corrinoids will not only serve as a
model for microbial community interactions across systems, but may also lead to the development of new
methods to alter microbial communities for beneficial outcomes."
11014025,"Targeting of eIF4A1 in drug-resistant breast cancer stem-like cells
 The overarching goal of this supplement project to the parent R01 grant is to obtain preliminary data that
points to disproportionate facilitation of cancer stemness by mRNA helicase eIF4A1 in African American (AA)
than European White (EW) triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients. Currently, there is more than 90% of
mortality in TNBC due to metastasis. This is due to chemoresistance and recurrence emanating from cancer
stemness. Neoadjuvant hemotherapy (NACT) is the mainstay of treatment for TNBC though FDA-approved poly
ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors are available along with immunotherapy (Atezolizumab). Despite the
availability of these therapeutic modalities, the observed pathological complete response (pCR) is lower in AA-
TNBC than EW-TNBC patients. Development of resistance to NACT and targeted therapies is due to the
presence of a small population of breast cancer stem-like cells (BCSCs) or tumor-initiating cells in the tumor.
BCSCs are pro-tumorigenic in nature as they are capable of self-renewal. The high plasticity of BCSCs allows
them to transdifferentiate into bulk tumor and stromal cells. More importantly. BCSCs are intrinsically
chemoresistant but can acquire resistance to chemo-, radio- and immunotherapies as well, especially during
treatment. This makes them a high value target in metastatic TNBC (mTNBC). Importantly, evidence points that
cancer stemness disproportionately affects AA-TNBC more than EW-TNBC women with higher rates of
recurrence and mortality in AA-TNBC than EW-women. It is imperative that cancer stemness disparity should be
determined in detail in order to target the TNBC more effectively in AA-TNBC patients.
 Tumors with high expression of BCSC stemness markers (ALDH and CD44) demonstrate the worst clinical
outcomes in TNBC patients. ALDH isoenzymes are disproportionately more expressed in AA-TNBC than EW-
TNBC. Our target, the mRNA helicase, the eukaryotic initiation factor 4A1 (eIF4A1) is expressed by both BCSCs
and non-BCSCs, making it an ideal target to eliminate both compartments simultaneously to prevent plastic
interconversion between them. We previously demonstrated that eIF4A1 can orchestrate cancer stemness and
chemoresistance in vitro.
 In this study, we propose that the helicase activity of eIF4A1 disproportionately regulates cancer stemness
and chemoresistance in AA-TNBC than EW-TNBC patients. In aim1, we will determine a cancer disparity role
for eIF4A1 in the regulation of pluripotency/cancer stemness and chemoresistance in vitro. In aim2, we will target
the helicase activity of eIF4A1 pharmacologically to antagonize primary and metastatic tumor burden using
patient-derived xenograft (PDX) TNBC models of AA, EW, and Hispanic women. This will facilitate obtaining
preliminary data for a future R01 grant addressing the role of eIf4A1 in cancer disparity in detail."
11008596,"Approximately 3% of the population has unruptured cerebral aneurysms, approximately 6 million people in the
US. About 30,000 ruptures per year, with devastating consequences. About 40% of patients with ruptured
aneurysms die, and 4 of 7 who survive have significant disabilities. To address this issue, several devices have
been developed that can be implanted to prevent aneurysm rupture. Flow diverters are one such device that
are increasingly being used to cover the neck of the aneurysm providing more durable occlusion. However,
until endothelialization and aneurysm occlusion has occurred patients are at increased risk of thromboembolic
complications and increased intracranial hemorrhage due to necessary dual antiplatelet therapy.
We have developed a BionanomatrixTM coating that mimics the characteristic properties of native endothelium.
Thus, we hypothesize that the BionanomatrixTM coating on the flow diverter can enhance endothelial coverage
and accelerate aneurysm closure. The coating provides sustained release of nitric oxide (NO), thus recruiting
and retaining endothelial cells. It also incorporates an endothelial cell adhesive ligand that promotes endothelial
cell retention and migration. The BionanomatrixTM is comprised of a biocompatable peptide-based material and
is coated on the flow diverters by simple water evaporation. This coating method minimizes the risk of
inflammatory responses.
This Phase II SBIR provides several important studies to progress this new coating through the necessary stages
to achieve FDA approval. This will include 1) scale up and optimization of the manufacturing process, long term
stability of the BionanomatrixTM coating, and packaging validation and 2) assessment of the BionanomatrixTM
coating efficacy and safety in a rabbit aneurysm model for 2 and 6 months. In collaboration with Dr. Kadirvel’s
group at the Mayo Clinic, in vivo assessment will verify that the BionanomatrixTM coating improves endothelial
coverage of flow diverters compared to a standard flow diverter in a rabbit aneurysm model. In collaboration with
NAMSA, the stability of the BionanomatrixTM coating and packaging validation will be evaluated following ISO
and ASTM guidelines which is critical for FDA application.
Development of the BionanomatrixTM coating that enhances occlusion of aneurysms and healing over the flow
diverters may have significant impact on the treatment of patients with brain aneurysms. With successful
completion of Phase II, we plan to move forward in Phase IIB towards IDE submission."
11009386,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Exposure to traumatic events is associated with increased HIV risk in adults, however for young, forcibly
displaced persons this relationship is less clear. An insurgency in northern Mozambique has internally
displaced >1 million inhabitants from Cabo Delgado province. Moreover, Mozambique has an HIV prevalence
of 11.5% and adolescent girls and young women (AGYW; ages 15–24) in sub-Saharan Africa account for 63%
of all new infections. It is critical to investigate how forced migration can impact internally displaced
Mozambican AGYW's vulnerability to HIV and devise relevant strategies to mitigate this potential effect.
Individuals may encounter a range of traumatic stressors (violence, conflict, family separation, etc.,) throughout
their displacement journeys. Few studies have examined traumatic stressors specific to displacement as
predictors of HIV vulnerability, particularly for AGYW in sub-Saharan Africa. Similarly, trauma informed HIV
prevention could prove beneficial to displaced AGYW, however it has yet to be delivered in humanitarian
settings. The proposed F31 responds to these research and practice gaps by engaging with recently displaced
AGYW in northern Mozambique to determine predictors of HIV vulnerability for this population (Aim 1) and
explore HIV prevention implementation strategies for AGYW in contexts of displacement (Aim 2). In Aim 1a., I
will employ mediation analysis to determine the relationship between exposure to (traumatic) stressors related
to displacement, common mental disorders, and HIV risk behaviors. In Aim1b., I will use latent class analysis
to create displacement stressor profiles for AGYW and then identify which classes of the sample confer the
highest level of HIV risk. The results of these aims will inform Aim 2: a needs assessment for the development
of a trauma-informed HIV prevention implementation strategy for displaced AGYW.
The outcomes of this study will contribute to HIV prevention efforts for displaced AGYW in Mozambique.
Studying the impact of forced migration on HIV vulnerability and HIV prevention for AGYW in Mozambique is
critical to understanding its influence on HIV prevention efforts in other regions of sub-Saharan Africa and
globally. The F31 fellowship will provide the candidate a specialized training in advanced quantitative methods,
HIV prevention implementation science, forced migration and health, and leading global health research
teams. This training, and the multidisciplinary mentorship team, will prepare the candidate for a career as a
HIV and mental health social epidemiologist conducting research in forced migration contexts and developing
trauma-informed HIV prevention strategies for displaced AGYW in sub-Saharan Africa."
11009731,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
HIV prevalence is high among transgender and gender-diverse/expansive (TGD) individuals in the Ending the HIV
Epidemic (EHE) priority jurisdiction of Los Angeles County (LAC). HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an evidence-
based innovation and part of both the local LAC HIV Prevention Plan and the EHE ‘Prevent’ pillar for individuals with
elevated risk for HIV exposure, such as TGD. However, uptake of PrEP remains low among TGNB individuals in LAC,
especially among TGD individuals of color. Low uptake and persistence have been due to multiple structural and syndemic
barriers such as unstable housing, financial hardship, violence exposure, and associated mental health burdens (e.g.,
depression, posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD]) that have been previously identified in multiple studies as well as by our
team in LAC. Currently, there is a high need to identify and test multilevel implementation strategies to improve and
accelerate PrEP uptake and persistence among TGD individuals. Our uniquely qualified community-academic collaborative
research team will leverage the parent study PrEP Well, a multiyear California HIV/AIDS Research Program-funded
implementation science project (CHRP: H21IS3484), to bring comprehensive and gender-affirming PrEP services to scale
in a first-of-its-kind transgender community center in LAC. Preliminary findings from the PrEP Well project indicate that
that mental health burdens resulting from violence, trauma, and minority stressors, remain a significant barrier and that
additional implementation strategies are currently needed for the successful integration of an evidence-based mental health
intervention, Skills Training in Affect and Interpersonal Regulation (STAIR), within the PrEP Well implementation strategy.
In the current 3-year pilot R34 study, we propose a Type 1: hybrid effectiveness-implementation pilot randomized controlled
trial to assess the acceptability, feasibility, appropriateness, and preliminary effects of integrating a trans-affirming,
evidence-based mental health treatment for persons who have experienced multiple prior traumas. Simultaneously, we will
assess the implementation process and address implementation barriers through a multilevel implementation framework.
This study will be among the first to integrate an evidence-based mental health intervention into an existing PrEP
implementation project that has shown promising effects in increasing PrEP uptake and persistence while simultaneously
addressing the structural needs (e.g., housing, legal, employment) of the local TGD community."
11009776,"Project Summary
 This proposal details a 5-year training plan to aid the continued develop of Dr. Sarah Short, Ph.D. into an
independent GI researcher. This research plan will focus on elucidating the role of glutathione peroxidase 1
(GPx1), a ubiquitously expressed selenoenzyme and potent antioxidant, in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
and colitis-associated dysplasia (CAD). Compelling preliminary data using Gpx1-/- mice indicates that unlike
many antioxidants whose loss exacerbates murine colitis, loss of GPx1 confers striking protection from dextran-
sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis. GPx1 deficiency also increases survival and stemness in 3D organoids
and alters metabolism in tissue culture cells, which may additionally promote regeneration and wound healing.
GPx1 expression also modifies immune cell function, as Gpx1-/- bone marrow-derived macrophages have
heightened response to “M2” stimuli and decreased migratory ability. Together, these results suggest that GPx1
augments inflammatory injury through alterations in both epithelial and immune cell function.
 Based on these finding, the hypothesis of this proposal is that GPx1 is detrimental in inflammatory bowel
disease by altering stem cell function, redox homeostasis, and immune responses. Further, inhibiting GPx1
activity may be an effective therapeutic strategy. This hypothesis will be tested in two specific aims to determine
how GPx1 contributes to intestinal epithelial cell homeostasis, oxidative stress, colitis, and colitis-associated
dysplasia. The first aim will investigate epithelial function, capitalizing on Dr. Short’s over 10 years of experience
in epithelial cell biology and barrier function. The second aim will complement epithelial-based studies by
determining how GPx1 loss alters immune cell recruitment, differentiation, and function, and identify how these
changes modify intestinal injury responses. In addition to being the logical “next step” experiments in defining
GPx1 function, these experiments provide the perfect framework to further Dr. Short’s development in aspects
of mucosal immunology which contribute to intestinal diseases, and will include new training in flow cytometry,
chemokine analysis, bone marrow transplantation, and the T-cell transfer colitis model. Dr. Short’s career
development will be further enhanced by regular discussions with primary mentor, Dr. Christopher Williams, and
her mentoring committee consisting of Drs. Keith Wilson, Jeremy Goettel, and Sean Davies. All studies and
training will take place at Vanderbilt, and the institution, Department of Medicine, and Gastroenterology Division
are highly supportive of Dr. Short’s academic career and fully support her application.
 Dr. Short’s ultimate goal is to become an independent academic researcher focusing on mechanisms which
regulate development and severity of IBD and colitis-associated cancer that can lead to improved therapeutic
options for these patients. Interestingly, both specific aims proposed in this application will evaluate GPx1 as a
therapeutic target using tiopronin, which is FDA-approved and well-tolerated. Together, these training
experiences will ensure Dr. Short is poised to direct a well-rounded independent research program in IBD."
11010105,"TITLE: Maintenance and Disassembly of Olfactory Cilia
The long-term goal of this project is to determine the role of cilia in the regulation and maintenance of olfactory
function and their alterations in cilia-related disorders. Olfactory dysfunction is common, affecting at least 16
million people in the U.S. alone. Our lab and others have found olfactory dysfunction to be a clinical manifestation
of a class of human genetic disorders termed ciliopathies. Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is one such disorder, in
which the altered cilia morphology of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) renders the cells unresponsive to odors.
Despite the identification of numerous genes underlying ciliopathies, curative therapies (including for olfactory
dysfunctions) are not yet available to patients. We reported that gene replacement to restore cilia and hence
sensory input in a limited number of differentiated OSNs was sufficient to rescue peripheral odor responses in
mouse models of a subset of ciliopathies. However, to better understand cilia biology in the olfactory system and
advance potential therapies, we must define the cellular mechanisms underlying olfactory penetrance of
ciliopathies. We must also determine whether these mechanisms are conserved across different ciliopathies
and might thus be amenable to the same therapeutic strategies. OSN cilia compartmentalize all of necessary
signaling machinery for odor detection and even though OSN cilia can be lost in both physiological and
pathological conditions, the cellular mechanisms that maintain the integrity of this essential OSN cell
compartment remain poorly understood. Cilia in other cells and organisms contain a multiprotein complex at its
base, termed the transition zone (TZ), that functions as a regulatory gate to control the unique protein and lipid
composition of cilia. Surprisingly little is known about the TZ in OSNs. This grant application will elucidate the
composition and subcellular organization of the OSN cilia TZ and how aberrant protein and lipid translocation
into cilia contributes to the disassembly of cilia. Our preliminary data suggest that alterations in intracellular
Ca2+ contribute to cilia disassembly by disrupting TZ components. We hypothesize that sustained elevations of
intracellular Ca2+ result in TZ remodeling of OSN cilia that is permissive for changes in cilia membrane lipid
distribution and actin infiltration, both of which are necessary for cilia disassembly in ciliopathies. Therefore,
we propose the following Specific Aims: (1) Determine the composition and organization of the OSN cilia TZ and
alterations accompanying disassembly in ciliopathies; (2) Determine the effects of elevated intracellular Ca2+ on
OSN cilia disassembly; (3) Determine the role of membrane PIP2 redistribution and F-actin infiltration in cellular
mechanisms of OSN cilia disassembly. Successful completion of this work will provide critical new insights
into the pathogenesis of human sensory perception diseases and is a necessary step for the development of
treatments for congenital anosmia and related olfactory dysfunctions that result from ciliopathy."

Emerging and re-emerging infectious disease (EID) outbreaks that are occurring with increasing frequency in
high-risk areas in South/Central America, West/Central Africa, and Southeast Asia are a threat to the United
States. Documented gaps in research infrastructure limit the capacity to rapidly respond to these outbreaks.
To address this challenge, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) is establishing
the Emerging Infectious Disease Research Centers Network (EIDRC-Net) to improve knowledge of EIDs;
leverage existing NIAID international efforts; and develop the capacity to mount effective, flexible, and rapid
outbreak research responses. RTI International and Duke University propose to establish the EIDRC
Coordination Center (EIDRC CC). The RTI-Duke CC will support the EIDRC-Net, which will comprise the
EIDRCs, research sites, the CC, and NIAID by realizing the following aims: (1) enhance EIDRC coordination
and collaboration by providing administrative, communications, logistical, and operational support; (2)
amplify NIAID's capabilities and reach by coordinating and supporting a sustainable, scalable, and adaptable
research infrastructure to optimize resources and knowledge sharing during inter-outbreak periods and to
respond rapidly and effectively during outbreaks; (3) ensure quality and consistency of study data by using
rigorous data and specimen management systems with built-in data quality assurance; (4) ensure quality of
biospecimens, assays, and reagents through harmonization of standard operating procedures across
EIDRC-Net sites and ongoing audit of cross-network procedures; and (5) develop the next generation of
investigators and in-country scientists by establishing a pilot research program that identifies, funds, and
mentors high-quality EIDRC applicants. By successfully accomplishing our five specific aims, the RTI-Duke
team will shift the outbreak research response paradigm by establishing scalable systems, processes, and
resources that not only provide the necessary infrastructure to facilitate EIDRC-Net performance and carry
out CC core functions during inter-outbreak periods, but also can be enhanced and expanded to bolster CC
research surge response activities during outbreaks. The EIDRC CC team will be co-led by multiple Principal
Investigators Donald Brambilla, PhD (RTI), a biostatistician with advanced training in biology and an
experienced CC leader, and Michael Anthony (Tony) Moody, MD (Duke), a pediatric infectious disease
specialist and Chief Medical Officer of the Duke Human Vaccine Institute. Together they bring extensive
scientific expertise, leadership, administrative experience, and international research expertise, including in
geographic locations most relevant to the study of EIDs. This partnership also leverages the operational
efficiency of RTI, a large nonprofit research organization with regional and project offices in over 75
countries, with the scientific rigor of Duke University, a premier university known for its cutting-edge medical
research and home to a state-of-the-art, NIAID-funded Regional Biocontainment Laboratory."
11013659,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Hand osteoarthritis is a painful polyarticular disorder that impairs an individual's ability to perform
manipulative activities of daily life. Hand osteoarthritis has been the subject of little research and has few
therapeutic options. Local inflammation, altered bone structure, and metabolic syndrome are pivotal to the
pathogenesis of hand osteoarthritis. Per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) – synthetically produced
grease-resistant chemicals universally detectable in the United States population – can stay in the body for a
long time and affect inflammation, bone metabolism, and metabolic factors that contribute to osteoarthritis.
PFAS became commercially available in the 1950s. Since then, the prevalence of osteoarthritis has doubled in
the United States – a finding that cannot simply be explained by increases in longevity or body mass index.
Cross-sectional studies demonstrate that exposure to PFAS may exacerbate osteoarthritis development. While
prior research has inspired efforts to reduce the production of certain PFAS, older PFAS persist in the
environment, and newer PFAS are entering the global markets and may present their own health risk. Given
the ongoing use of PFAS and the scale of contamination, there is an urgent need for longitudinal studies to
clarify the relationship between PFAS and osteoarthritis and to identify susceptible populations to inform public
health policies and suggest therapeutic approaches. Our interdisciplinary team, which has expertise in
osteoarthritis and environmental health, will benefit from the wealth of annually collected data and
biospecimens from the Osteoarthritis Initiative, the largest and most comprehensive cohort study of
osteoarthritis. Furthermore, we selected a case-cohort sample with radiographic assessments of hand
osteoarthritis and measures of systemic bone health, inflammation, and metabolic factors. To achieve our
overall goal of testing whether each PFAS and a mixture of PFAS relate to hand osteoarthritis, we will
complete 3 aims using environmental mixture modeling. Specifically, we will determine if PFAS increase the
risk for hand osteoarthritis incidence (Aim 1) and relate with greater changes in disease burden, articular
cartilage, and bone (Aim 2). We will also perform exploratory analyses to assess whether bone health,
inflammation, and metabolic factors mediate the relationship between PFAS and osteoarthritis. Furthermore,
we will consider sex, age, and obesity as effect modifiers because investigators reported these interactions in
cross-sectional studies. The findings from this study will help inform public health policies, identify susceptible
populations, and suggest therapeutic targets."
11014899,"The objective of this administrative supplemental proposal is to demonstrate that a specific model is
needed to improve the accuracy of predicting Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) risk in
African Americans through Artificial Intelligence (AI) analysis of pre-diagnostic CT images. PDAC is the
fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in both men and women in the United States despite its low
incidence rate. PDAC has a high mortality rate in part because more than 80% of the patients are at advanced
stages when they were diagnosed for the first time. Notably, there are significant racial disparities in PDAC
incidence and mortality rates, with the highest rates in African Americans compared to Non-Hispanic
Whites and Hispanics. The objective of the parent award is to develop a PDAC prediction model to identify
individuals who have high risk for PDAC in the next 10 years through AI analysis of pre-diagnostic CT images.
Identification of individuals at high risk for PDAC has high clinical significance as follow-up imaging
examinations or biopsy may assist in early detection and allow surgical intervention while the tumors are still
resectable. Pre-diagnostic CT images provide critical morphological information associated with underlying
biological changes and heterogeneity at the pre-cancer or early cancer stage. A pilot study using data from the
parent award identified a number of different radiomic features in pre-diagnostic CT scans that are predictive of
future PDAC between African Americans and Whites. Based on these studies, we hypothesize that: i) pre-
diagnostic CT image features associated with future PDAC occurrence are significantly different between
African Americans and Whites; ii) CT radiomic model developed for the general population in the parent award
is less accurate in African Americans than in the general population for PDAC prediction. To verify these
hypotheses, we will retrospectively evaluate CT pancreatic images obtained up to 10 years prior to PDAC
diagnosis that were deemed non-cancerous by radiologists. A group of subjects who underwent similar
imaging studies for non-gastrointestinal disorders and were age/gender matched with pre-diagnostic imaging
will serve as healthy controls. Pre-diagnostic CT radiomic features will be compared between African
Americans and Whites. If they are significantly different, we will demonstrate that the CT radiomic
model developed for the general population in the parent award is less accurate in African Americans than in
the general population for PDAC prediction. The purpose of this administrative supplemental proposal
pilot study is to demonstrate that there is need for a specific PDAC prediction model through AI
analysis of pre-diagnostic CT images for African Americans to improve the PDAC prediction accuracy.
Accurate prediction of PDAC has high clinical impact as it may allow early detection and treatment of this fatal
disease, which has the highest rates of incidence and mortality in African Americans."
11015752,"Background: Patients undergo millions of noninvasive diagnostic imaging tests, including computed
tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and nuclear medicine, in the United States annually. Based on
Appropriate Use Criteria (AUC) developed by professional medical societies, 20-30% of these tests may be
inappropriate, i.e., the potential benefit-to-risk ratio is not maximized. Limited data on appropriateness of
imaging within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) suggests that inappropriate use is similar to that
outside the VHA. A variety of methods have been employed to encourage more appropriate use of noninvasive
imaging. One of the most popular is an electronic decision support tool (DST). These software products are
added to patient care workflows to capture meaningful AUC data and reduce unnecessary testing. A recent
VHA Evidence Synthesis Program (ESP) report concluded that little is known about the implementation of
DSTs and possible negative ramifications of their use. Further, the cost to the VHA of noninvasive imaging
testing, which has not been calculated, is needed to determine the burden of inappropriate tests.
Specific Aims: In the course of this award, we will achieve the following specific aims: (1) assess potential
barriers and facilitators to successful adoption of a DST, (2) determine the effectiveness of a DST using a
stepped implementation process, and (3) estimate the fiscal effectiveness of a DST in the VA health system by
developing a micro-costing model for delivery of noninvasive imaging tests.
Significance: Through these investigations, we will glean valuable insight into how to adjust processes to
improve the ordering of millions of costly tests. If effective at reducing unnecessary tests, the results from this
proposal will ultimately improve Veterans' access to care and reduce radiation risks.
Innovation: Study of DSTs has focused primarily on effectiveness, with little attention paid to the
implementation process and possible adverse effects such as provider dissatisfaction and inefficiency. Our
investigations will break new ground in studying these aspects of DSTs. The use of qualitative and micro-
costing methods as we propose is innovative given their underuse for clinically oriented research.
Methods: We will apply the Practical Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model (PRISM) and
Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) to the specific aims for this award. In Specific Aim 1, we will use
qualitative and quantitative methods to identify possible barriers and facilitators to DST implementation through
interviews and surveys of providers who order noninvasive tests. In Specific Aim 2, implementation of a DST
for noninvasive imaging will be assessed from the rate of testing, the proportion of testing that is inappropriate,
and feedback from providers in three discrete steps. First, providers blinded to AUC for imaging tests will order
tests as usual. Second, at the point of ordering, they will receive immediate feedback on appropriateness of
the test and be given the option to change the order. Third, if the provider's decision is not consistent with
AUC, the provider will be required to give a justification for the test order. These steps will help us understand
the implementation process for DSTs and to address gaps in the literature raised by the recent ESP. In
Specific Aim 3, the cost of noninvasive imaging tests will be calculated using information from administrative
databases, time-and-motion observation of care delivery, and cost diaries from Veterans.
Expected Results: We anticipate that through these investigations, we will learn and be able to share
important lessons about implementation of a DST for noninvasive imaging. The results will be the basis for
investigator initiated research grants on further spread of DSTs within the VA system and adaptation to other
imaging/testing modalities such as echocardiography."

The overall goal of our research is to determine whether treatment of a Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)
improves the outcomes of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We showed that MDD is present in up to
25% of CKD patients and independently associated with progression of CKD to End-Stage Kidney Disease,
hospitalization, and death. Depression was also shown to be associated with adverse patient-centered outcomes
such as lower quality of life (QOL), fatigue, poor sleep, and non-adherence to diet and medications. However,
evidence for efficacy and tolerability of commonly-used antidepressant medications or nonpharmacologic
treatments are very limited in CKD patients. Previous data, primarily derived from dialysis-dependent patients,
were limited by small samples, lack of randomization and control, short durations, and high dropout rates. Our
group was the first to conduct a double-blind randomized controlled trial for MDD treatment in 201 patients with
non-dialysis CKD, and showed that sertraline, a commonly used selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI),
was no more efficacious than placebo for improving depressive symptoms. Given the high prevalence of MDD
in CKD, its association with adverse outcomes, and lack of data to support efficacy of conventional
treatments, it becomes imperative to test novel strategies to treat MDD in CKD patients. We propose to
compare with a control group, the efficacy and tolerability of two novel treatment strategies - (1) Behavioral
Activation Teletherapy (BAT) for 16 weeks, with the addition of bupropion, a non-SSRI antidepressant, at 8
weeks for patients whose depression has not remitted (non-remitters); and (2) bupropion for 16 weeks, with the
addition of BAT at 8 weeks for non-remitters. In Aim 1, we will investigate the efficacy and tolerability of these 2
strategies vs. control for improvement in a primary endpoint of depressive symptoms in 201 patients (67 per
group) with non-dialysis CKD stages 3b-5 and MDD at 2 sites, randomized 1:1:1 to either strategy or a control
group of Clinical Management plus placebo. We hypothesize that either approach vs. control will result in a
minimal clinically important difference of 2 points improvement in depressive symptoms, as ascertained blindly
by the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology. In Aim 2 we will investigate the efficacy and tolerability
of 8 weeks of (1) single-blind BAT plus placebo or (2) double-blind bupropion plus Clinical Management vs.
control for improvement in depressive symptoms. In Aim 3, we will compare the efficacy of these 2 treatments
strategies vs. control for improvement in CKD patient-centered outcomes including a. adherence to medications
and healthcare visits; b. fatigue; c. sleep; and d. overall functioning. A clinical trial is urgently needed to address
the evidence gap that exists for MDD treatment in CKD patients. Establishing the efficacy of 2 different strategies
would be imperative, so that if found to be comparably efficacious, the option most acceptable to patients could
be offered in clinical practice. We have a track-record of successfully conducting multicenter trials in CKD and
have assembled a team of highly qualified investigators at 2 sites to ensure successful project completion."

As we work to build addiction data science literacy, our field could benefit from increased diversity of background
and perspectives in the workforce. The complexities of addiction as a clinical domain present challenges,
including the intersection of mental health and chronic pain. Understanding how these factors influence data
collection, often due to subjective reporting, the influence of stigma, health disparities, and longstanding barriers
to care, can impact data analytics and interpretation. Moreover, the separation between clinical and data experts
can create additional challenges to advancing the field. Aligning the addiction background with data science
expertise could enhance the potential of emerging addiction researchers. Another impediment to progress is a
need for more diversity in our workforce, which could be partly attributed to a lack of awareness of the field during
training (undergraduate to postgraduate).Developing training for a diverse workforce that understands
challenges at the intersection of addiction and data science will accelerate our understanding of addiction's
complexity. The long-term goal of this Developing a Diverse Workforce: Advancing Data Science for Addiction
Research and Professional Training (ADAPT) R25 application is to support the training of a diverse workforce
by building an addiction data science short course and scalable educational content with a focus on addiction
data analytics through a health equity lens. The overall objective of this proposal is to provide the curated
research framework and resources to support emerging investigators with diverse data science addiction
approaches. Our central hypothesis involves developing an addiction data science training program that will
expand the research capacity of diverse emerging investigators. We will achieve the goals of this proposal
through the following aims: Aim 1- Develop and refine immersive, tailored addiction data science skills course
that provides hands-on demonstrations, tutorials, and presentations on FAIR (Findable, Accessible,
Interoperable, Reusable) data principles, computational analytical methods (AI and ML), systems modeling, NLP,
and analysis and linking of addiction big data. Aim 2- Incorporate novel methods of program evaluation and
dissemination, which will include leveraging NLP modalities to mine academic databases using advanced
analytics to capture participant outcomes. At the successful completion of the proposed research, the expected
outcome is a scalable and widely disseminated education intervention for addiction data science with enduring
content to support emerging researchers, removing many of the barriers to traditional pathways (e.g.,
asynchronous conceptual and project-based content that is widely available). This R25 ADAPT project will
provide a strong basis for the conceptual foundation needed to begin addiction data science research without
sustained effort from a limited pool of addiction data science experts. This research aligns with the mission of
NIH NIDA to train a diverse workforce to perform addiction data science research at the highest quality levels."
11015239,"Substance use disorders affect ~15% of the population, with gender differences in all stages of substance use.
Female sex-steroid hormones explain some of the disparity, such as accelerated transition from casual use to
addiction, as estradiol produces sex-specific differences in rodent learning and cocaine self-administration.
Prolonged cocaine use is known to engage dorsal striatal circuits. Synaptic plasticity in such circuits is critical
for a variety of types of reward learning, highlighting the potential role such plasticity could play in substance
use disorders. Thus, understanding sex differences in cocaine use requires determining how estradiol impacts
molecular signaling and synaptic plasticity in the dorsal striatum. Our preliminary results show that estradiol,
acting at estradiol receptor type α, impairs long term potentiation (LTP) in dorsomedial striatum (DMS) in
estrous females; however, the cell type in which estradiol acts has yet to be identified. Striatal spiny projection
neurons (SPNs) are either direct pathway SPNs, which promote action, or indirect pathway SPNs, which inhibit
action, and changes in these SPNs are critical for various behavioral consequences. Thus, it is essential to
understand LTP deficits in both direct and indirect pathway SPNs. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis
that estradiol impairs LTP in indirect pathway SPNs in the DMS. LTP in the dorsal striatum critically depends
on activation of extracellular regulated kinase (ERK), which also is modified by both cocaine and estradiol.
Estradiol enhances cocaine-mediated dopamine release and interacts with metabotropic glutamate receptors
to modify ERK activation, but an unbiased approach is needed to determine whether estradiol impacts other
signaling pathways. Our preliminary results have identified several signaling pathways that are modified by
estradiol; however, a critical question is how cocaine interacts with estradiol to modulate these signaling
pathways. We propose cutting-edge molecular and transgenic approaches combined with novel computational
modeling to test the hypothesis that estradiol-mediated changes in gene expression impair LTP and to
determine how cocaine further modifies the signaling pathways underlying synaptic plasticity. In Specific Aim
1, we perform electrophysiology in transgenic mice to determine whether LTP is impaired by estradiol in one or
both SPNs. In Specific Aim 2, we use innovative techniques of single nuclei RNA sequencing, translating
ribosome affinity purification followed by RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics to identify signaling
pathways modified by estradiol and cocaine self-administration in a cell-type specific and spatial manner. In
Specific Aim 3, we use innovative, data-driven modeling of signaling pathways followed by model-driven
experiments to causally test which interactions between critical signaling pathways produce estradiol-mediated
deficits in LTP. Successful completion of the proposed research will delineate how estradiol influences synaptic
plasticity in dorsal striatum, including in conjunction with cocaine, and provide a foundation for future work to
understand sex differences in reward learning and the consequences of cocaine use."

Tuberculosis (TB), a disease caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), remains a major infec-
tious disease of humans in the world. After the initial local infection of one site in the lung Mtb somehow dissem-
inates in the lung and often spreads beyond the lung. In fact, extrapulmonary TB is a hallmark of the disease in
young children and immunocompromised adults that is difﬁcult to diagnose and treat. Our understanding of Mtb
dissemination, both within the lung and beyond, remains limited, however. In this proposal we assembled a team
of scientists with expertise in computational biology (Ganusov, Aitchison, Duffy, Langston) and TB pathogenesis
(Urdahl, Sherman, Behar) to provide quantitative understanding of mechanisms of Mtb dissemination the lung
and systemically. To this end, we will be using a number of highly innovative techniques such as i) a novel animal
model of TB: infection of mice with an ultra low dose (ULD, 1-3 colony forming units, CFU) of Mtb along with a set
of 50 barcoded Mtb strains, ii) an Mtb strain H37Rv-pBP10 with the replication clock plasmid, allowing to estimate
how quickly bacteria are eliminated in vivo, and iii) mRNA-based gene signatures predicting bacterial numbers in
murine lungs and TB disease progression risk in humans. With three complementary speciﬁc aims we will pro-
vide detailed, quantitative understanding of fundamental processes of how Mtb disseminates from the deposition
in lung alveoli to the whole lung and systemically. In Aim 1 we will determine the pathway of Mtb dissemination
within the lung using a novel model of ULD-infected mice that mimics better human infection than many other
animal models. In particular, we will discriminate between alternative hypotheses of Mtb spread in the lungs
such the “bubble model” (in which Mtb spreads locally between lung lobes) and the “reseeding model” (in which
Mtb spreads hematogenously to different parts of the lung after disseminating systemically). In Aim 2 we will
determine the contribution of different cell populations, including Mtb-speciﬁc CD4 T cell response, to kinetics of
Mtb dissemination systemically in mice infected with conventional doses (CD, 150 CFU) of Mtb. To parameterize
best ﬁt models we will use data from experiments with Mtb H37Rv carrying the replication clock plasmid pBP10.
Finally, in Aim 3 we will attempt to improve on our recently derived mRNA-based gene signatures predicting
CFU in murine lungs using cutting-edge graph theory-based methods of data dimensionality reduction. We will
also perform experiments and deﬁne a new signature predicting disseminated TB in mice, and test its accuracy
using data from monkeys and humans. Taken together, by combining experimental data from highly innovative
experiments involving novel techniques (ultra low dose infections, barcoded strains, replication clock plasmid,
microarray-based gene signatures) we will provide a quantitative understanding of how Mtb disseminates in the
lung and systemically in the body."

Chronic liver diseases like metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), alcoholic liver disease
(ALD), and viral hepatitis afflict more than 4.5 million Americans and are a major cause of death in those over
45. These diseases are associated with the development of liver fibrosis, which can lead to cirrhosis,
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and liver failure, necessitating liver transplantation or resulting in death. There
are currently no FDA-approved therapies for modifying the progression of liver fibrosis, making this a significant,
unmet medical need. Quiescent hepatic stellate cells (HSC) become activated after injury and produce excessive
extracellular matrix (ECM) material. Paxillin is a key adaptor protein in recruiting multiple regulatory proteins,
mediating downstream signaling, and linking the ECM to the cell cytoskeleton. Among its binding partners, focal
adhesion kinase (FAK), a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase and scaffolding protein, is a highly promising target in liver
fibrosis, along with paxillin, due to its key role in promoting HSC activation. Acting downstream of transforming
growth factor beta-1 (TGF-β1), paxillin upregulation and FAK activation induce HSC activation, myofibroblast
differentiation, the formation of stress fibers, and the upregulation of ECM proteins. Notably, paxillin
downregulation and FAK inhibition attenuate liver fibrosis in animal models. Unfortunately, FAK-kinase domain
inhibitors have shown only partial effects and poor selectivity in non-fibrosis indications, which is independent of
its major role as a paxillin-binding partner and scaffolding protein. Furthermore, FAK-kinase inhibitors have
shown significant toxicity due to the conserved ATP-binding pocket and off-target effects. Through the interaction
with paxillin, FAK localizes to focal adhesions and regulates the focal adhesion complex. Therefore, peptide
inhibitors targeting paxillin-FAK interaction may show greater efficacy and safety than FAK-kinase inhibitors.
FAKnostics has identified a first-in-class series of peptidic inhibitors that directly target the paxillin-FAK
interaction. FAKnostics’ novel peptides have 100-fold higher potency at binding the FAK than the native paxillin
LD2 peptide motif. The ability of these candidates to inhibit the downstream effects of FAK activation has been
confirmed in vivo in a syngeneic mouse model of melanoma. However, the effect of paxillin-FAK inhibition on
the profibrogenic effects has not yet been fully evaluated. This Fast Track STTR aims to demonstrate proof-of-
concept for use of these novel peptidic inhibitors in the treatment of liver fibrosis and to identify a preclinical
candidate for future development. In Phase I, FAKnostics will optimize lead peptides to improve the
biophysical/biochemical activity, characterize peptides in vitro, and confirm efficacy in an animal model of liver
fibrosis. Phase II will include evaluation of ADMET properties, development of a long-lasting subcutaneous
formulation, PK/safety studies, and comprehensive efficacy validation in liver fibrosis models. This will enable
future completion of additional IND-enabling and manufacturing work to advance novel peptide drugs to the clinic."

To end the HIV epidemic, we need integrated care models that address HIV and PrEP care, and co-existing
substance use (SU) disorders that disrupt uptake and consistent use of effective interventions. The overarching
goal of this R01 proposal is to conduct a randomized controlled trial to assess the ability of a
Collaborative Care Prevention, Treatment, Navigation, Engagement, Resource (PrTNER) intervention to
increase initiation of preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) (for those at-risk for HIV) and decrease viral load
(for those living with HIV) among young Black and Latino men who have sex with men (YBLMSM) through
engagement in SU treatment. The Collaborative Care (CC) PrTNER is a multi-component intervention
developed by members of our research team specifically for YBLMSM aged 15 to 24 who are at-risk for or living
with HIV. This model moves beyond the individual to consider the broader context in which, substance use, and
HIV risk are (re)produced.
Enhanced models that integrate SU treatment into HIV and PrEP primary care services (using a collaborative
care approach that incorporates feedback from a psychiatrist and support from a peer coach) are needed to
address the nuance of substance use in this population. We, therefore, are proposing to conduct a randomized
trial to evaluate an integrated collaborative care model (CC PrTNER) using the following aims:
Specific Aim 1: To compare the proportion of YBLMSM with co-existing SU at risk for HIV infection who initiate
(start or restart) PrEP over the 12 months in the CC PrTNER arm versus standard of care (SOC).
Specific Aim 2: To compare the proportion of YBLMSM with co-existing SU living with HIV infection who are
HIV virally suppressed at 12 months in the Collaborative Care PrTNER arm versus SOC.
Specific Aim 3: To compare the effect of CC PrTNER versus SOC on non-tobacco SU in YLBMSM with co-
existing SU and examine the effect of change in SU on PrEP uptake and HIV viral suppression.
This proposal directly addresses goals 1, 2, and 4 of the 2022 National HIV/AIDS Strategy to End the HIV
Epidemic through: prevention, treatment, and addressing co-existing SU disorders through comprehensive
integrated care delivery. It further can transform the adolescent, health department and Ryan White care settings
serving YBLMSM through harmonization of PrEP, HIV and SU treatment care delivery and implementation of a
collaborative care model to address the multi-level barriers that impede uptake and adherence."

Macrophages play paradoxical roles in cancer: They can be tumoricidal, but in many cancers, macrophages
promote metastasis. There has been growing evidence that macrophages can modulate cell behavior via
unconventional cell contact-mediated communication in development and homeostasis. We have recently
extended these paradigms by discovering that macrophages can also engage in unconventional cell contact-
mediated communication with tumor cells within the tumor microenvironment, and that these interactions
contribute to metastasis. By visualizing and manipulating highly migratory melanoma cells and their
microenvironment in vivo, we unexpectedly found that tumor-associated macrophages transfer cytoplasmic
contents to melanoma cells in a cell contact-dependent manner. Remarkably, 70-80% of melanoma cells that
received macrophage cytoplasm disseminated from the primary tumor in both zebrafish and murine models.
We are now ideally positioned to identify key component(s) that are transferred from macrophages to tumor
cells for metastasis, and how this transfer occurs. Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that perform a variety
of essential cellular functions. Mitochondria have been shown to transfer to tumor cells in vivo, restoring their
respiration and ability to form tumors. While these elegant “proof of principle” studies demonstrated that
mitochondrial lateral transfer can occur in the tumor microenvironment, the donor stromal cell(s) were not
identified, the transfer mechanism was not defined, and the fates and functions of mitochondria in tumor cells
were not characterized. Excitingly, we have found that primary human macrophages can transfer mitochondria
to human breast cancer cells and melanoma cells, two cancers in which macrophages have been shown to
play a pro-tumorigenic role. Tumor cells that receive macrophage mitochondria either by spontaneous
mitochondrial transfer in coculture, or by direct injection of purified macrophage mitochondria, exhibit increased
proliferation. Surprisingly, we find that after mitochondrial transfer occurs, the transferred mitochondria remain
as a spatially distinct population from the host mitochondrial network. Furthermore, we found that high levels of
local reactive oxygen species accumulate at transferred mitochondria, suggesting an intriguing hypothesis that
transferred mitochondria may provide a signal to tumor cells, rather than providing excess mitochondrial
function as has been previously described. To test this hypothesis, we propose to: (Aim 1) Understand how
mitochondria dynamically reorganize for mitochondrial transfer to tumor cells and (Aim 2) Determine how
mitochondrial transfer mechanistically induces cancer cell proliferation. Taken together, these experiments will
reveal whether macrophage mitochondrial transfer can instruct breast cancer and melanoma cells to become
more robust and metastatic. Our goals are to define how immune cells function in the tumor microenvironment,
and to provide a basis for developing future immunotherapies that limit metastasis."

 Conditions such as osteoporosis and osteoarthritis, and malignancies such as breast cancer, negatively
affect the musculoskeletal system, leading to substantial disability and health care costs. Thus, there is an
ongoing need to better understand the causes of these conditions and to support development of more effective
and well-tolerated therapies. The Center for Musculoskeletal Disease Research (CMDR) was established at the
University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) during Phase 1 to meet this need. The scientific theme of
the CMDR is that identification of molecular contributors to musculoskeletal dysfunction and disease will guide
development of effective therapies. To study these conditions, we have assembled teams of junior and
established investigators and supported development of junior investigators to the point of achieving independent
R01-level funding. We also utilize state-of-the-art technologies to analyze gene expression, genetically
manipulate animals, and analyze the skeleton. These complementary approaches, together with access to
clinical investigators and patient samples, have synergized to create a unique and productive research
environment. A key to the continued success of the Center will be to increase the number of investigators whose
research is aligned with our scientific theme via development of more junior investigators and recruitment of new
and established investigators. To accomplish this, in Phase 2 we propose to support the development of 3 Project
Leaders by providing structured mentoring, financial resources, and collaboration with other CMDR investigators
(Aim 1). We will also continue to strengthen the biomedical research infrastructure at UAMS by increasing the
capabilities and utilization of 4 research cores that provide access to rapid, high-quality services and that develop
new approaches, such as CRISPR interference for in vivo loss-of-function studies (Aim 2). To continue building
a critical mass of musculoskeletal investigators and teams, the Center will utilize a Pilot Project Program, targeted
recruitment of investigators with complementary expertise, and incorporation of new and established center
investigators into synergistic and productive research teams (Aim 3). Successful implementation of this
Organization and Management Plan will, in the long-term, lead to a self-sustaining Center of Biomedical
Research Excellence that will generate novel and important results leading to more effective therapies for the
numerous conditions that involve the musculoskeletal system."

Over 20% of the hemodialysis patients develop life-threatening central line-associated bloodstream infections
(CLABSIs). According to the CDC, >250,000 CLABSIs, having mortality rates of 14-40%, occur in the US
annually, and among them >100,000 cases are directly related to hemodialysis central venous catheter (CVC).
One of the tools currently used to reduce CLABSIs is the use of antimicrobial CVCs. However, the current
antimicrobial CVCs remain susceptible to biofouling (i.e., biofilm formation) as they do not display repellency to
biofoulants. In other words, host biomolecules and cellular debris from dead microorganisms can accumulate
upon their surface, thereby facilitating adherence of living microbia and their associated biofilms. In addition,
most antimicrobial CVCs function by gradually releasing embedded biocides/antibiotics with risk of developing
antimicrobial resistance. To address the problems, we hypothesized that incorporating biofilm-repellent
zwitterionic moieties together with antimicrobial gemini dicationic moieties into CVC surfaces, a synergistic
effect could be realized. Our preliminary study confirmed the synergetic effect. Technology innovation is 1) the
new CVC surface covalently immobilized with gemini dicationic moieties to provide best-in-class antimicrobial
properties without concerns of development of antimicrobial resistance; and 2) the new CVC surface
containing both biofilm-repellant and antimicrobial moieties to overcome the deficiencies of each alone to
prevent the root cause of CLABSIs. To demonstrate the feasibility of our technology, in Aim 1, we will
maximize the synergetic effect by iteratively optimizing the ratio between the antimicrobial and repellent
moieties with respect to antimicrobial efficacy, biofilm repellency, coating anti-infective durability, over varying
timeframes. In Aim 2, we will produce prototype hybrid CVCs, and compare their infection risks relative to
commercial antimicrobial CVCs against pathogens responsible for >90% of CLABSIs. In Aim 3, we will
evaluate bio- and hemo-compatibility of the prototypes using assays specified in ISO 10993-4 for hemolysis,
coagulation, complement-activation, and inflammation as well as leachate toxicity. Expected outcomes in this
Phase I include >20% reductions in proliferation, antimicrobial, and biofilm assays with a similar/better blood
compatibility compared to current antimicrobial CVCs. >20% reduction in the national infection rate with our
CVC product would prevent >50,000 CLABSIs, saving >16,000 lives and >$500 million direct healthcare costs
each year. Phase II will include in-vivo studies to ensure accurate translation of in-vitro and ex-vivo properties.
In Phase II, we will also initiate production of our prototype CVCs at a FDA cGMP compliant manufacturing
facility, subsequently apply for 510(k) clearance for subsequent clinical evaluation. Our serviceable obtainable
market (SOM) is the US CVC market, estimated to grow $1.3 billion in 2026. As our hybrid-coating can be
applied to nearly all types of catheters including IV and urinary tract catheters, the total available market (TAM)
is the global catheter market, expected to reach $74.8 billion by 2028."

Research: Pharmaceuticals modifying intestinal incretin secretion and gluconeogenesis are promising new
therapies for obesity and diabetes mellitus, but their mechanisms of action are poorly understood limiting their
application. Elevated circulating pools of the essential branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) and their
metabolites are consistently associated with obesity and diabetes with research primarily focused on liver and
muscle metabolism of dietary protein without considering intestine amino acid metabolism. Circulating BCAAs
in mammals must either originate from the diet or the microbiota residing in the lumen that upregulates its
expression of BCAA enzymes in obese and insulin-resistant animal models. The amino acid glutamine provides
significant energy to the intestine in fasted and fed states, reducing glucose oxidation by intestine cells but it is
not known if BCAAs drive similar metabolic changes. The intestine also metabolizes microbe-produced nutrients
like propionate in fasted and fed states for energy and metabolite production. In isolation, microbe-produced
nutrients and BCAAs are known to stimulate the secretion of peptide incretin hormones from nutrient sensing
cells lining the lumen that coordinate whole body metabolism in preparation for a nutrient load. Incretin response
and enteric glucose metabolism are reduced in obese and diabetic patients but the mechanisms driving
dysregulation are poorly understood. Synergy between microbe-produced and dietary nutrients could contribute
to incretin dysregulation and/or alter enteric metabolic effecting circulating metabolite pools. Directly measuring
the metabolism of dietary and circulating BCAAs will quantify the contribution of intestine metabolism to
circulating BCAA and metabolite pools. Determining if intestine BCAA metabolism interacts with the metabolism
of microbiota-produced nutrients and sucrose will show if intestine metabolism contributes to the elevated BCAA
and metabolite pools associated with metabolic disease.
Candidate/Training: Long term, I plan to pursue an independent research career managing an interdisciplinary
laboratory developing probiotics and/or pharmaceuticals that change intestine nutrient handling to treat metabolic
disease. In pursuit of this goal, I have assembled research aims and a mentoring team to provide me with the
foundational knowledge and training essential to my progress. Dr. White, an expert metabolic physiologist with
many high-profile publications on BCAA metabolism in other tissues, will balance the more microbiology-driven
mentorship provided by Dr. John Rawls. We have detailed the technical skills I will gain through their training or
formal courses and detailed the community meetings I will attend to build the necessary skills to transition to
independence. A larger committee including the directors of Duke’s Metabolic Physiology Institute and
Microbiome Center as well as the Chief of the Division of Gastroenterology in the Department of Medicine will
monitor my technical and professional progress to ensure adequate support is provided."

 Matrix Metalloproteinases 2 and Metalloproteinase 9 (MMP2/9) play active roles in a variety of cellular
responses, including the regulation of uterine contraction. The underlying molecular mechanisms driving these
effects are currently unknown. The overall objective of the parent proposal is to understand the mechanisms by
which MMP9 promotes uterine contraction and to determine if specific inhibition of MMP9 promotes uterine
quiescence. The central hypothesis is that elevation of MMP9 to levels seen in preterm patients is sufficient to
increase the contractile response in human uterine tissue and drive preterm parturition. The parent project
includes experiments will be performed to determine if MMP9 inhibition can delay parturition in preterm mouse
models. This supplemental project will enhance the parent proposal by identifying genes and proteins whose
uterine expression is altered when MMP activity is systemically blocked. These data are expected to be
significant because these they will identify potential mechanistic links to explain how MMP2/9 modulate uterine
contractions. These data will provide a foundation for future experiments to determine if MMP2/9 substrates
can serve as druggable targets to promote uterine quiescence and reduce the number preterm births."

In this SBIR Phase II we will design, integrate, and evaluate implementation protocols in both primary care
and behavioral health for the pediatric adaptation of the clinical Mental Health Quotient (cMHQ), a
comprehensive transdiagnostic mental health assessment tool developed in Phase I, along with a short
screener called the MHQ-10. This work will be done in collaboration with the UC San Diego ImplementatioN
Science and Team Effectiveness in Practice (IN STEP) Children’s Mental Health Research P50 ALACRITY
Center and Rady Children’s Hospital San Diego (RCHSD), and will test the feasibility, acceptability, and
effectiveness across two Rady pediatric primary care clinics and one mental health referral hub. The
majority of instruments presently in use have numerous challenges including a lack of insight into the
individual’s specific symptom profile, particularly missing many of the emerging symptoms in adolescents,
as well as lack of insight into positive aspects of the patient, their lifestyle, traumas, adversities and other
factors that can give the clinician a whole person view. The pediatric MHQ-10 is a first line screener to be
offered in primary care that overcomes limitations of current short screeners by incorporating emerging
symptoms in adolescents as well as positive capacities to position individuals on a mental wellbeing scale
that enables more precise triage. The pediatric cMHQ will be offered to those recommended for
intervention by the MHQ-10 or those presenting for behavioral health challenges and overcomes the many
limitations in the current landscape. Through a single compact assessment, it captures a comprehensive
transdiagnostic symptom profile mapping to ten disorders, positive/protective life factors, lifestyle, life
traumas and adversities to generate a vetted clinician report that includes a score of their aggregate mental
wellbeing that can track their preclinical trajectory and provide guidance to the clinician. However, beyond
the design of the assessment itself, the success of any new assessment within a hospital or clinic depends
crucially on how it is embedded in the workflow and the consequent patient and clinician experience. This
involves key criteria such as when and how patients are presented the assessment, how they are
encouraged to complete the assessments, when and how doctors are presented the reports, and how they
are guided to use the reports during the appointment. In this Phase II SBIR we will use an innovative,
participatory implementation research method of co-design (brainwriting premortem) to develop a powerful
workflow for integration of the pediatric MHQ suite within primary care and behavioral healthcare at RCHSD.
This workflow will be designed to flexibly fit within a range of electronic health record platforms although it
will be specifically implemented for Epic which is used at Rady. This will be followed by a multi-dimensional
evaluation of implementation that will form the basis for enabling widespread adoption and a transformative
paradigm for integrated mental health care."
11014017,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 South Africa bears the brunt of the global HIV epidemic, with over one-fifth of the 37 million people living
with HIV within its borders. While we have seen tremendous success with the scale-up of effective treatment to
over 20 million people, we are at a pivotal moment in the global HIV response, and South Africa lies at the
center of the effort to reach the UN Sustainable Development Goal of ending HIV as a public health threat by
2030. A critical challenge in the care continuum in South Africa is the number of people living with HIV who are
not virally suppressed. In 2022, over 30% were not on ART or had a detectable viral load. Individuals with gaps
in care represent a substantial proportion of those who are not virally suppressed, and those who manage to
return to care continue to face challenges. In the Western Cape Province, only 29% of those with prior gaps
were virally suppressed one year after restarting treatment. Drivers of engagement behavior are
heterogeneous, and include individual, social, and system factors that interact dynamically over years of
treatment. Differentiated Service Delivery (DSD) models of person-centered care have been shown to
effectively address these barriers to care, however, to date, DSD models have been offered only to people with
HIV considered ‘stable’ (i.e., retained in care and virally suppressed). Thus, those at high risk of poor outcomes
are ineligible for DSD models. In response, our team intends to work with the City of Cape Town and
provide the critical data needed to impact policy guidelines. We designed CARES–Club-based
Adherence support for Reinforcing Engagement and Sustaining Viral Suppression for South Africans with
Gaps in HIV Care–to test a scalable, evidence-based DSD model (CARES-DSD) to address individual, social,
and structural barriers to long-term engagement among people with HIV who have experienced an ART
interruption or unsuppressed VL (PWH-Gaps). CARES-DSD is a six-month adherence club model of care that
offers flexible services with multi-month dispensing of medication de-linked from clinic processes and support
from lay counselors and peers, which has been proven to sustain retention and viral suppression in the
Western Cape. We propose a Hybrid Type 1 trial to evaluate the effectiveness of CARES-DSD on viral
suppression among PWH-Gaps at 24 months post-enrollment, as compared to an enhanced standard-of-care
(an optimized guidelines-based approach). We will recruit 300 participants from our current study (SUSTAIN,
R01MH125703, MPI: Orrell/Sabin), through which we have identified persistent engagement gaps in 43% of
the participants despite adherence counseling, to test this model of care. We will then assess the mechanisms
of intervention impact using mixed methods, guided by the Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation model of
Behavior (COM-B), and determine the implementation outcomes using Proctor’s model. Ultimately, our goal is
to provide an effective and efficient model of care to ensure people living with HIV achieve optimal health and
well-being, and South Africa reaches the 2030 goals."
11018689,"The heterogeneous conformational ensembles of flexible proteins are critical to their
function in bacterial virulence, cellular regulation, and other physiological roles, yet most
high-resolution structural methods succeed precisely by trapping such proteins in one or
two conformational states. Spectroscopic techniques such as DEER and single-molecule
FRET can yield population distributions for conformational ensembles but do this for a
small set of label-label distances. The driving hypothesis of this project is that advanced
computational models can be used not only to help refine protein conformational
ensembles using DEER or smFRET data but also to direct such experiments by predicting
the optimal placement of labels. We therefore develop new methods 1) to predict the
most informative placement for a set of labels given an initial, incomplete estimate of a
conformational ensemble and 2) to better refine conformational ensembles given
heterogeneous conformational population data, potentially from multiple experimental
sources acquired under different conditions. We apply these methods to gain insight into
flexible molecular recognition and cellular invasion by Neisseria and into cellular
regulation of the synaptic fusion machinery that controls neurotransmission."
11008764,"The major goal of this application is to define viral interactions with host pathways that are essential for the
assembly of infectious HIV-1 particles. We previously identified Rab11-FIP1C (FIP1C) as a key adaptor
protein required for HIV-1 envelope protein (Env) trafficking and particle incorporation, a finding that
established the model stating that host recycling pathways are required for particle incorporation. Recent work
from our laboratory has extended this model, defining the role of KIF16B in Env trafficking and identifying
discrete motifs within the Env cytoplasmic tail that are essential for recycling and particle incorporation.
Preliminary data presented here now identifies the tubular recycling endosome (TRE) as a major new
component of the recycling machinery involved in particle incorporation of Env. TRE components including
MICAL-L1 and EHD1 were shown to be essential for Env trafficking and incorporation into particles.
Remarkably, disruption of TRE trafficking severely depleted Env from particles, but only in those cells that
have been shown to be nonpermissive for incorporation of cytoplasmic tail (CT)-depleted Env. Thus, this
pathway holds the key to understanding the contribution of the Env CT to the recycling and particle
incorporation of Env. Experiments in Aim 1 will define essential components of the TRE that contribute to Env
trafficking, examining EHBP1, Rab10, Syndapin2, and MICAL-L1. In Aim 2, the critical role of EHD1-mediated
scission from the TRE in Env trafficking to the PM site of assembly will be defined using cellular/biochemical
and imaging approaches. A unique FAP-tagged Env construct will be employed to visualize and quantify Env
trafficking from the TRE to the PM in live cells. Aim 3 will determine the mechanisms responsible for cell type-
dependence of incorporation of Env, using a novel cell-cell fusion approach combined with identification of
host factors that interact with the Env CT. Together, the work outlined here will expand upon a productive line
of investigation that seeks to comprehensively define the mechanism of incorporation of Env into HIV-1
particles."
11031784,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Patients aged 65 and older account for an increasing portion of traumatic brain injury (TBI)
patients. TBI contributes to over one third of trauma related deaths and aged TBI patients suffer
increased morbidity and mortality compared to young TBI patients. The impact of TBI is also
highlighted through its significant long-term cognitive and psychiatric complications suffered by
survivors. After TBI, microglia adopt a constitutively active state leading to an increased
inflammatory response. Our previous studies show that TBI results in an influx of monocytes,
monocyte derived leukocytes, and CD8+ T-cells into the brain. Additionally, we demonstrated that
infiltrating inflammatory immune cells mediate injury and neurocognitive outcomes after TBI, and
reduced infiltration attenuates poor neurologic outcomes and improves behavioral outcomes. But
the interplay between microglia, immune cells, and the gut is still poorly understood. To assess
recruitment of monocytes and T-cells by activated microglia, we will deplete microglia in young
and aged mice and observe immune cell infiltration after TBI. Microglial depletion will occur
through a colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) inhibitor, PLX5622 formulated into rodent
chow. After microglia depletion, mice will undergo TBI or sham injury. Activation, proliferation, and
differentiation of monocyte and T-cell subtypes will be assessed through flow cytometry to
determine whether microglial depletion attenuates immune cell accumulation. To investigate the
impact of the gut microbial community on immune infiltration and microglial activation we will
utilize a murine FMT model. We will prepare fecal slurry from young and aged mice to administer
to aged mice either before or after TBI with PBS as a vehicle control. Mice will undergo
neurocognitive testing to assess phenotypic alterations due to FMT. We will assess
neuroinflammation in these mice by flow cytometry, microglial gene expression through
scRNAseq, and clonal expansion of T-cells through scTCRseq. Overall, this project will assess
the interplay of microglia, infiltrating immune cells, and the gut in the aged brain after TBI,
potentially determining routes for therapeutic development. This project will expand my
capabilities through advanced training in neuroimmunology, RNA sequencing, and neurocognitive
testing while utilizing my expertise in immunology and advanced flow cytometry. I will present my
findings in numerous professional settings for peer review including national conferences and I
will publish my findings in peer-reviewed journals in preparation for a future MOSAIC K99/R00
award."

ABSTRACT. 1.6 million Americans suffer from functional tricuspid valve regurgitation (FTR); that is, tricuspid
valve leakage due to valve-extrinsic factors such as pulmonary hypertension-induced right ventricular
remodeling. Of those patients, only approximately 8-10 thousand are surgically treated. This undertreatment of
patients with FTR has been declared “a public health crisis”. While the reasons for undertreatment are multi-fold,
one is unarguably that available treatment options have suboptimal outcomes while being high-risk; thus, tilting
the risk-benefit scale toward conservative treatment. For example, FTR recurs in as many as 10-30% of patients
treated via the gold-standard surgical technique tricuspid valve annuloplasty. Additionally, mortality rates of re-
operation are exorbitantly high (>30%). Clearly, better therapeutic approaches are needed to treat FTR and to
stop undertreatment of a large patient population. Our collaborative team has recently shown in two separate
sheep models that the tricuspid valve leaflets grow and fibrotically remodel in FTR. The discovery of tricuspid
valve (mal)adaptation now raises the possibility to both harness the valve’s native ability to grow, and thereby
counteract disease, and to therapeutically target leaflet fibrosis. However, before being able to use our new
knowledge toward improving treatment of FTR and toward overcoming today’s massive undertreatment, tricuspid
valve maladaptation must be better understood: To date, we don’t know its stimuli, the mechanisms of its
detrimental effects on valve function, or how therapy may be used to suppress fibrosis. The objective of this
current proposal is to overcome these gaps in knowledge. To this end, we will test our central hypothesis that
disease-induced leaflet strains stimulate leaflet maladaptation which, in turn, hinders valve coaptation and
contributes to FTR, and that leaflet maladaptation may be halted by counteracting disease-induced stimuli. We
will pursue our objective in three aims: 1) Identify the stimuli of tricuspid valve maladaptation, 2) Delineate the
mechanisms through which maladaptation impedes valve function, 3) Test whether prophylactic intervention
halts maladaptation. To accomplish these aims, we will combine innovative, chronic sheep models with in-vitro
flow loop valve characterization using high-speed 3D imaging, and extensive mechanical, compositional, and
biological tissue phenotyping. Our team has a long collaborative track record of studying tricuspid valve function
and disease, and is supported by asenior colleague with 30 years of experiencein in-vitro valve experimentation.
Upon conclusion of this work, we expect to have identified the stimuli for tricuspid valve maladaptation,
understand the mechanisms through which it impedes valve function, and have shown that it can be halted
through surgical intervention. Thus, we will have shed light on a recently identified disease mechanism of the
tricuspid valve and suggested it as a novel therapeutic target. Our work will therefore pave the way toward a
better understanding and better treatment of FTR as a public health crisis. While our work is surgically-focused,
it is equally important to transcatheter repair strategies which amplifies the significance of ourwork and its impact."

Age and chronic inflammatory stress drive the emergence of mutant bone marrow stem cells that can lead to specific hematologic malignancy associated mutations allow HSC to resist specific stressors could be leveraged toward therapies aimed at neutralizing the selective advantage of the malignant clone. We have recently found that patients with myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) have a dampened response to the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and this leads to persistent production of the inflammatory cytokine TNFα. In a murine Jak2V617F MPN model, pharmacologic blockade of IL-10R signaling enhances the selective advantage of Jak2V617F mutant cells. The objective of this project is to define how JAK2V617F mutant HSC gain a selective advantage over wild-type (WT) HSC when IL-10R is blocked. Our central hypothesis is that dampened IL-10R signaling creates an inflammatory state that negatively affects WT but not JAK2V617F mutant HSC, thus endowing JAK2V617F mutant cells a selective advantage. Moreover, we hypothesize that dampened IL-10R signaling is an intrinsic feature of those predisposed to acquire MPN. In Aim 1 we will determine the prevalence of an IL-10 resistance phenotype among MPN families. We have found that MPN patients display an inability to respond to IL-10, which we term the “IL-10 resistance phenotype”. However, cases with a family history of MPN have not been systematically evaluated for the phenotype, nor have unaffected family members. We will determine the prevalence of the IL-10 resistance phenotype in affected and unaffected members of our growing MPN family registry which currently contains 53 MPN families. In Aim 2 we will identify the genetic basis for blunted IL-10R signaling in MPN. We will perform targeted DNA sequencing and gene expression profiling (i.e., RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and differential DNA methylation analysis) to identify the underlying mechanism responsible for dampened IL-10 signaling in MPN. Using sorted peripheral blood monocytes we will use Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC chips to determine if MPN patients and unaffected family members with blunted IL-10 signaling have differential methylation of IL-10R signaling genes. Gene expression profiling will be performed in parallel to determine if the methylation pattern accurately predicts gene expression. We will also perform targeted DNA sequencing, focusing on cytokine receptor pathway genes, and paying close attention to any genes found to have differential methylation and/or expression, to identify the genetic basis for blunted IL-10 signaling in MPN patients."
11018469,"Project Summary/Abstract
Vaccinia virus complement control protein (VCP) has been shown to have structural and functional similarity
to human complement control proteins. VCP modulates the human and rodent complement system. During
the past two decades, we have studied VCP extensively in a number of preclinical inflammatory disease
models including Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and spinal cord injury (SCI) and demonstrated that controlling
complement mediated inflammation by VCP has significantly improved outcomes, leading to our hypothesis
that VCP can be potentially used for therapeutic treatments of these diseases. AD is one of the most
devastating diseases amongst the aging population in the world and the 6th leading cause of death in the
US. It is well known that amyloid proteins and plaques are associated with activation of several
proinflammatory mediators, especially complement components. Interestingly, ApoE genotypes that
significantly facilitate A- deposit, are strongly involved in regulation of classical complement cascade.
These pro-inflammatory mediators can cause damage on their own as well as working in synergy with each
other, ultimately leading to neurodegeneration. Over time, the damaging role of complement components
overpowers their beneficial effects as the disease progresses. As a result, complement pathways have
become potential targets for developing treatments of diseases such as AD. To provide a proof of concept,
we investigated the role of complement pathways regulated by VCP in AD mice model. In this model, VCP
was shown to be effective in preventing memory loss. To further develop VCP as a potential treatment for
AD, in this SBIR phase I study, we will aim at characterizing high qualify humanized recombinant VCP
(hrVCP) and at the assessment of candidate hrVCP in animal models in a more clinical relevant manner by
an independent CRO company with two specific aims: 1) To subject hrVCP to a full battery of in-house
analytical characterization and stability profiling; ; Specific Aim 2: To validate our previous findings by
testing efficacy of hrVCP in APP/PS1 AD models with collaboration of an independent CRO laboratory. Our
milestone goals include development of active and stable hrVCP pre-formulation in Saline, production of
more hrVCP if resources allow, and validation of efficacy data in AD models from a laboratory other than
our own. If we are successful, PK/safety assessments and other preclinical studies of purified hrVCP
protein will be the goal of Phase II studies, along with even more rigorous safety studies including in vitro
cardiotoxicity, hepatotoxicity and bone marrow toxicity studies in stem cells derived tissue cells. We expect
that the SBIR phase1 studies will lead to development of hrVCP for a commercial scale therapeutic
approach to target the progression of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration anticipated in AD patients."
11018556,"Background: The Veterans Health Administration has a long history of providing maintenance dialysis
treatment for Veterans with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the community under the VA Fee Basis
program. Starting Fiscal Year 2015, access to specialized nephrology care in the community became available
to the much larger population of Veterans with advanced kidney disease not yet on dialysis under the Veterans
Choice Program (VCP) and is expected to continue under a consolidated Community Care program. Like their
counterparts on dialysis, Veterans with advanced kidney disease not on dialysis are a high-cost high-needs
population for whom access to care, continuity of care and coordination of care are all vitally important in
optimizing quality and outcomes. All three metrics are important in building strong relationships between
patients and providers, and supporting the kind of iterative cycle of evaluation and re-evaluation and care
coordination needed to properly care for these patients
Objective: We will use mixed methods to study the impact of the VA’s evolving community care policy on
outcomes and costs for Veterans with advanced kidney disease and identify opportunities for program
improvement. Because many of the outcomes and care processes relevant to this population are sensitive to
continuity and coordination of care, we hypothesize that receipt of VA-financed nephrology care in the
community will negatively impact a range of clinical outcomes and care processes relevant to this population
and will be more costly than nephrology care provided within the VA. We anticipate that for some groups, the
potential harms of care fragmentation and discontinuity may be outweighed by the benefits of more timely
receipt of needed care in the community. Because some VA medical centers may be more effective in
coordinating care with community providers to mitigate the effects of care fragmentation, we hypothesize that
there will be heterogeneity in the effect of VA-financed community care within the population and across VA
medical centers that could be informative in improving the process of community referral for this population.
Methods: We will use national VA administrative and clinical data to track the impact of VA-financed
community care on clinical outcomes, care processes and costs to the VA system among Veterans with
advanced kidney disease using an instrumental variable approach (Aim 1). To identify opportunities for
improving the value of community referral for this population, we will elicit the perspectives and experiences of
Veterans with advanced kidney disease eligible for, or receiving VA-financed community care and their VA and
community care providers (Aim 2).
Impact: This proposal will directly address three VA HSR&D priority areas (Health Care Systems Change,
Healthcare Access and Patient-centered Care, Care Management, and Health Promotion). The work proposed
here is extraordinarily timely and policy-relevant given that the VA MISSION Act of 2018 recently passed both
the House and the Senate with strong bipartisan support. We anticipate that our work to measure the impact of
VA-financed community nephrology care on Veterans with advanced kidney disease will help to identify
opportunities for more effective use of agency resources to optimize access, continuity and coordination of
care for a high-cost high-needs segment of the Veteran population. To ensure that our work is poised to shape
evolving VA policy around provision of community care, the investigators are partnering with the VHA National
Program for Kidney Disease and the Office of Community Care."

The objective of this proposal is to optimize and validate the hemostatic bioadhesive paste in compliance with
FDA regulatory guidance for the FDA IDE approval in advance of the future pivotal clinical trial and ultimate
regulatory clearance and commercialization. In light of the huge and rapidly growing clinical and economic costs
of major hemorrhagic events in cardiovascular and other surgeries, various hemostatic agents have been
developed and clinically tested. To date, however, there is no hemostatic solution that can achieve effective and
rapid hemostasis in frequent and high-risk bleeding of patients under anticoagulation or coagulopathic settings
due to the incompatibility of conventional coagulation-based hemostatic approaches. To address these
limitations of existing solutions, during the prior development (Phase I-equivalent), our collaborative team
developed a proof-of-concept prototype of a hemostatic bioadhesive paste for rapid (within 10 s) coagulation-
independent control of bleedings by uniquely utilizing the novel blood-resistant bioadhesive mechanism. The
preliminary pre-clinical validation and analysis based on in vivo rat and porcine models demonstrated the
promising hemostatic efficacy and underlying mechanism of the hemostatic bioadhesive paste for the
bioadhesion-based coagulation-independent rapid control of bleedings. Building upon the promising outcome of
the prior development, under the scope of this Direct-to-Phase II SBIR proposal, we will further optimize and
validate the hemostatic bioadhesive paste in compliance with relevant FDA regulatory guidance for the highly
effective and broadly affordable solution to treat high-risk bleeding in the anticoagulated or coagulopathic
patients. If successful, the proposed project will allow SanaHeal to prepare and submit the FDA IDE package in
advance to a pivotal clinical trial and ultimate commercialization with far-reaching benefits for patients and the
healthcare system."

The vagus nerve is involved in normal physiology, and disturbances in vagal control have been implicated in
several pathophysiological conditions. However, there is a lack of information on the physiology of this nerve in
humans as well as multi-organ responses to vagal nerve stimulation (VNS), despite over 100,000 VNS implants
worldwide to treat epilepsy, depression, anxiety, and gastrointestinal disorders. Likewise, very little is known
about how to best optimize VNS settings for existing therapies or how to develop VNS for new therapies. The
proposed Research Evaluating Vagal Excitation and Anatomical Linkages (REVEAL) center aims to conduct
groundbreaking research on the effect of VNS on four key autonomic systems: the autonomic nervous system
(ANS), the cardiovascular system, the immune system, and metabolic system. The ambitious scope of the
research requires the participation of eight major academic and medical institutions with over 40 participating
key personnel, over 140 patients, an External Advisory Board (which includes patient advocates), a Data and
Safety Monitoring Board, and an NIH Steering Committee and other NIH personnel. REVEAL will have three
aims corresponding to its Cores. The Clinical Core will manage over 140 patients and clinical staff from 8 different
institutions to obtain consistent data on VNS effects on ANS, the cardiovascular system, the immune system,
and metabolism. The Data and Analysis Core will gather, store, and analyze data from clinical sites to produce
publicly available datasets for development of VNS-based therapeutics and other research. The Administration
Core will coordinate the work of the REVEAL Cores and stakeholders to meet the goals of NIH SPARC’s VESPA

The rationale for this application is to fill the current void in clinical research training for the
emerging discipline of fetal-neonatal neurology. The rapid development of the fetal and newborn
brain, and the unique genetic and environmental factors that threaten such development, make
the immature brain distinctly different from that of even older infants. Yet, despite the growing
recognition of the lifespan impact of events during this critical period, clinical and research
training in neurology of the fetus and newborn remains remarkably inadequate. The objective of
this program is to provide multidisciplinary training in clinical neuroscience research within the
context of the fetal/neonatal environment. Trainees will enter a two to three year program with
an MD, DO, PhD or MD/PhD. The primary site for the Clinical Research Training Program for
the Fetal Neonatal Brain is the Children's National Health System (CNHS) in Washington, D.C.
Training will be provided in the responsible conduct of research, the acquisition of high-
throughput `bedside' clinical data in the NICU, and the processing and analysis of data using
sophisticated neurodiagnostic techniques. Two NIH-funded Principal Investigators with
complementary clinical and research expertise will be supported by neuroscience preceptors
(neurology, neuroradiology, neurogenetics), and mentors/subject matter experts from neonatal
intensive care, neonatal cardiac surgery, and clinical research methodology. The mentorship
team is assembled from Children's National and the George Washington University (GWU).
Children's National is well positioned to lead this program, based on (i) its strengths in
translational and clinical research, and mentorship in the central areas of inquiry; (ii) its formal
funded research collaboration (CNICA Program) with Inova Women's and Children's Hospitals,
and (iii) the strength of its fetal and neonatal medicine programs. Each trainee will develop
special expertise in an advanced neurodiagnostic technique, complete a Master's of Science in
Health Sciences Clinical (MSHS) at GWU or equivalent, and will design and implement a
research project overseen by her/his mentorship team. By graduation, the trainee will have
presented his/her data to at least one national research meeting, submitted one or more
manuscripts to external peer-reviewed journals, and have a well-formulated plan for a grant
application. The program will prepare trainees with the skills and expertise to develop into future
leaders in the effort to reduce and prevent brain injury in the fetus and newborn infant."

11014026,"Abstract from Parent Grant
DNA recording is a recently developed technology that allows cellular signaling events of interest to be
followed over time without removing cells from their physiological context. During a DNA recording
experiment, genetically engineered cells expressing the DNA recorder acquire mutations at a “recording
locus” as the result of transient cellular events, without perturbing their normal phenotype. At the end of the
experiment, once their eventual phenotype is known, cells can be collected and their histories determined
by sequencing the recording locus. The work proposed here will lead to a DNA recorder that is not limited,
as current technology is, to recording one or two cellular events per experiment, but can record dozens of
events in parallel, allowing an unbiased examination of cell history in any context compatible with
genetically engineered cells. In this project, the new DNA recorder will be used to study long-term effects
for a cell of experiencing significant spontaneous DNA damage. Although DNA damage is very well studied,
it has not previously been possible to follow the rare cells that experience significant spontaneous
damage, especially in an in vivo mammalian context. The new DNA recorder will be developed in stages:
First, intracellular recording machinery, will be created for a small number of cellular events associated
with the DNA damage response. Next, the fidelity of this new recording machinery will be extensively
validated in cultured cells, including head and neck cancer cells becoming resistant to the DNA-damaging
chemotherapeutic cisplatin. Finally, the recorder will be validated in mouse embryonic stem cells, and used
to test how spontaneous DNA damage affects cell fate determination during the earliest stages of
development."

Koronis Biomedical Technologies and its collaborators propose to commercialize a low-cost, portable
respiratory assessment device using the forced oscillation technique (FOT). The proposed FOT
device requires zero skill from the subject and operator, making it ideal for occupational health
screening, physician office use, and home monitoring. The current gold standard for accurate and
repeatable measurement of lung function is spirometry. Spirometry is a pulmonary function test that
measures the volume and rate of airflow a patient can maximally exhale into a tube attached to a
precise airflow meter. The role of spirometers has been limited due to their reliance on technique
adherence. Unlike many medical diagnostic tests where the patient is essentially a passive
participant, spirometry requires active patient participation. The procedure requires the patient to take
the deepest breath possible and then exhale as hard as possible for as long as possible. The test is
normally repeated to ensure reproducibility. Spirometry results are highly dependent on patient
cooperation and effort. Patients often face a significant learning curve. Some patients cannot, or will
not, produce interpretable results. FOT measures pulmonary airway resistance and reactance. In
contrast to traditional spirometry, the key clinical advantage of FOT is that the technique is passive
and does not require the patient to breathe forcefully on command. In this project, all components of
the production system will be finalized and evaluated for usability and performance in human
evaluations along with market release under FDA market clearance."

In response to the NIH U54 Faculty Institutional Recruitment for Sustainable Transformation (FIRST) Program
(RFA-RM-20-022), Drexel University proposes to establish a robust, transformative and sustainable program to
support diverse early career scientists engaged in health disparities research spanning population science to
intervention research. This proposal, a collaboration across Drexel University led by Drexel’s Dornsife School
of Public Health and College of Nursing and Health Professions, leverages our nationally and internationally
recognized NIH and other extramurally supported research, our community-based clinical practices serving
diverse, underserved communities, and our shared core values of social justice and health equity guiding our
pedagogy, research and hiring practices. Our proposal also strongly reflects Drexel University’s unwavering
commitment and newly instituted strategic goals to promote inclusive excellence and ensure diversity, equity,
retention, and promotion across for diverse faculty across their career pathways. Our proposed program will
create a collaborative structure involving multi-level inputs from University leaders, academic units and faculty
to catalyze sustainable institutional change that supports scientific and inclusive excellence in the conduct of
health disparities research. With support from the FIRST program, we will hire and mentor a diverse (gender,
race, ethnicity) group of 10 early-stage faculty in three clusters who are competitive for tenure-track research
positions with joint or secondary appointments across relevant departments, programs, or colleges, Using
evidence-based, multi-level mentorship strategies at the individual, department, college and university levels,
we will form a scientifically rigorous and supportive learning community in which FIRST faculty will engage in
individual and group activities leading to submissions of competitive NIH R01 research proposals. FIRST
faculty will be hired who are committed to diversity and whose research addresses one of 3 pillars of health
disparities research: detecting (defining/measuring health disparities), understanding (identifying determinants
of disparities), and/or reducing (intervene, evaluate, translate, scale, policy) health inequities in cross-cutting
thematic areas (aging, chronic disease, and/or environmental determinants). Developing and supporting a
cadre of diverse researchers has been identified as an evidence-based strategy for advancing new
methodologies, measures, and novel multi-level/multi-modal interventions that address inequities and improve
individual and population health outcomes. We will deploy a multi-level and multi-methods evaluative approach
guided by critical and intersectionality theories to evaluate nuanced experiences of bias and structural
discriminatory practices as well as program successes at the individual, department, mentor, college and
University levels of achieving inclusive excellence. Our FIRST Program is co-led by nationally/internationally
recognized leaders in population health, intervention science, mentorship of racially/ethnically diverse faculty
and evaluation of programs seeking inclusivity."

occur together. How do these modalities, and their presence in the input, contribute to fundamental aspects
of lexical acquisition? We explore how infants exploit multi- compared with uni-modal input as they segment
wordforms from continuous speech and map meanings to wordforms. We hypothesize that the ability to make use
of multimodal information including touch (a fundamental social signal) in the input facilitates infants' language
learning by contributing information relevant to the alignment of word boundaries and the association of word
meaning to wordforms. In Aim 1 (Experiments 1a-c) we determine whether sensory input that incorporates
more modalities aligned with speech input, results in improved segmentation of the speech stream and improved
attention to word edges for infant learners. In Aim 2 (Experiments 2a and 2b) we determine whether sensory
input that incorporates more modalities associated with objects results in improved word learning for language
learners. Our approach builds on our preliminary work showing that (a) caregiver touch+speech alignment and co-
occurrence is common in interactions with infants and (b) infants use multisensory information in early language
learning tasks. The design exploits behavioral and physiological measures to examine whether the alignment
(Aim 1) and/or association (Aim 2) of multimodal touch, speech, and visual cues inﬂuence language learning in
typically developing children.
 The proposed research is signiﬁcant for its clinical and theoretical implications. First, it is clinically signiﬁcant
since exploring the role of multimodal cues on language learning may impact clinical approaches since current
language therapies or interventions concerning the input tend to emphasize auditory alone or auditory+visual
domains, but not tactile ones. Thus, discoveries concerning the child's use of multimodal information which
includes touch in language learning could lead to new avenues for early intervention for infants and toddlers
showing delayed language acquisition or who are at-risk of language disorders. Second, this work is theoretically
signiﬁcant since it explores how multimodal information may help the learner at different levels of representation
(wordform representations, semantic representations) in ways that could constrain the language learning problem.
The ﬁndings from this research will challenge our views concerning what kinds of informational streams infants
attend to when learning language, and thus inﬂuence intervention and parenting practices."
11012247,"Objective - The objective of this study is to implement and test a neuro-mechanical gait assist (NMGA) device
to correct gait characterized by muscle weakness, incoordination or excessive tone in veterans with hemiplegia
from stroke that adversely affect their ability to walk, exercise, perform activities of daily living, and participate
fully in personal, professional and social roles.
Research Plan – Prototype NMGA device will be used to develop a finite state controller (FSC) to coordinate
user’s volitional effort coordinated with surface muscle stimulation and motorized knee assist as needed.
Brace mounted sensors will be used to develop gait event detector (GED) which will serve the FSC to advance
through the phases of gait or stair climbing. In addition, a supervisory rule-base intent detection algorithm will
be developed using brace mounted sensors and user interface input to select among various functions
including walking, stairs climbing, sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit maneuvers. The FSC controller tuning and
intent algorithm development and evaluation will be on three pilot subjects with gait deficits from stroke.
Outcome measures during development will provide specifications for a new prototype NMGA design which
will be evaluated on three pilot subjects to test hypothesis that NMGA improves walking speed, distance and
energy consumption of walking. These baseline data and device will be used to design a follow-up clinical trial
to measure orthotic impact of NMGA on mobility in activities of daily living at home and community.
Methodology – After meeting inclusion criteria, pilot subjects will undergo baseline gait evaluation with EMG
activities of knee flexors and extensors, ankle plantar and dorsiflexors and isokinetic knee strength and passive
resistance. They will be fitted with NMGA combining knee-ankle-foot-orthosis with motorized knee joint and
four channels of surface neuromuscular stimulation of plantar- and dorsi- flexors, vasti and rectus femoris.
Brace mounted sensor data will be used for gait event detector (GED) algorithm development and evaluation.
GED will serve FSC to proceed through phases of gait based on supervisory rule-based user intent recognition
algorithm detected by brace mounted sensors and user input interface. FSC will coordinate feed-forward
control of tuned stimulation patterns and closed-loop controlled knee power assist as needed to control foot
clearance during swing and stability of the knee during stance. Based on data attained during controller
development and evaluation, a new prototype NMGA will be design, constructed and evaluated on three pilot
subjects to test hypothesis that NMGA device improves safety and stability, increases walking speed and
distance and minimizes user effort. For all experimental conditions, a statistical power of 90% was used to
determine the number of repetitions required in the single subject design to detect statistically significant or
0.2m/s minimal clinically important improvement in walking speed.
Clinical Significance - The anticipated outcome is improved gait stability with improved swing knee flexion,
thus, increasing the safety and preventing injurious falls of ambulatory individuals with hemiplegia due to stroke
found in large and ever-increasing numbers in the aging veteran population. Correcting gait should lead to
improved quality of life and participation."
11012248,"Ototoxicity is a well-established toxicity of the platinum-based chemotherapies that are in frequent use for the
treatment of solid tumors of the head and neck, lung, ovary, testicle, and bladder in adults. Early indicators of
ototoxicity, which could prompt intervention to potentially prevent the health-related and psychosocial impacts
for these patients, are not apparent in the absence of direct auditory measurement. National audiology
guidelines, have stipulated that prospective monitoring for ototoxicity (OM) be conducted for all patients at high
risk for this harmful side effect to allow for early detection, aural rehabilitation, and potential modification of the
drug treatment before the effects become disabling. Specifically, for patients receiving cisplatin, monitoring prior
to each treatment is recommended practice (ASHA 1994; AAA 2009). Based on our current research, OM must
target those patients who will receive the most benefit to be feasible for large-scale implementation in VA.
 The goal of this study is to address the critical need in hearing healthcare for improved OM, diagnoses and
clinical interventions in patients receiving treatment with cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin chemotherapeutics
by providing new knowledge of the mechanisms of ototoxicity, its functional manifestation, and new insights on
the patient and provider perspective. Our overall approach is to investigate relationships among the specific
behavioral deficits, sites of lesion, and hearing healthcare priorities of chemotherapy patients to learn which
patients will develop ototoxicity, how much damage they can expect, and whether it will impact their everyday
life. This knowledge is needed to shift current OM practice patterns toward a more effective and clinically feasible
approach so that Veterans at elevated risk for ototoxicity could have their auditory concerns addressed through
patient-centered OM, rehabilitation and/or drug therapy interventions. Clinical impacts include estimates of
ototoxicity incidence for Veterans receiving platinum-based chemotherapeutic treatments; and tools to generate
an individual ototoxicity risk profile that when combined with the patient-provider team priorities, will inform OM
resource allocation, pre-treatment counseling, and decision making for ototoxic drug treatment. Knowledge gains
include increased understanding of tinnitus generation and speech understanding deficits and the implications
of these symptoms regarding the underlying ototoxic injury.
 To understand more about the mechanisms underlying ototoxicity-caused tinnitus and hearing problems
[Aim 1], we will refine and expand our previously published dose-ototoxicity model and determine its utility for
predicting changes in auditory deficits for individual patients. One refinement will be to include pre-treatment
ABR and DPOAE measures in the model because we expect post-treatment tinnitus and hearing status to be a
function of the combination of any new (ototoxicity-induced) damage with pre-exposure (age and/or noise-
related) damage. Sensory and neural damage will be indirectly estimated using a novel approach that combines
ABRs and DPOAEs (e.g. Bramhall et al. 2017). Neurodegeneration will also be estimated using wideband
acoustic reflex testing, which elicits the reflex to lower stimulus levels than traditional tests, and can be
administered at bedside unlike ABR (Feeney et al. 2017). To determine the clinical impacts of ototoxicity [Aim
2] we will assess the extent to which speech understanding in background noise is compromised following
chemotherapy treatment, using a task that manipulates the temporal cues used for localization (Gallun et al.
2013). Tinnitus and hearing handicap questionnaires will provide knowledge of perceived auditory dysfunction.
Combined information about the clinical impacts and ototoxicity mechanisms will create ototoxicity risk profiles
for individual patients based on their age, planned chemotherapy, and pre-exposure inner ear function. A national
survey of oncologists will be used to review oncology- and OM-related practice patterns in the US.
 These results are expected to change current audiological best practice recommendations and are crucial to
advance widespread implementation of OM both within and outside VA."

The goal of this proposal is to develop an anti-Candida peptide vaccine that works alone or as an adjunct to
antifungal drugs to reduce fungal burden and morbidity due to life-threatening disseminated candidiasis, which
remains the most common bloodstream infection in hospitalized patients in the US. Despite the availability of
modern antifungal therapy, crude mortality in the last decade has remained unacceptably high. In particular,
C. auris is a multidrug-resistant (MDR), health care-associated fungal pathogen, and has emerged as the first
fungal pathogen to cause a global public health threat. There are no effective vaccines for Candida infection or
indeed for any fungi, and significant therapeutic challenges remain. Additionally, current anti-Candida treatments
are plagued by significant toxicity and poor efficacy, especially treating drug resistant Candida species in
immunocompromised patients. Thus, there is a pressing and urgent need for disease prevention through active
and passive immunization strategies. We previously identified Fba and Met6 (Fba, derived from fructose-
bisphosphate aldolase and Met6, derived from 5-methyltetrahydropteroyltriglutamate homocysteine
methyltransferase) peptide immunogens that induce protective antibodies in a mouse model of candidiasis. To
further advance this antifungal peptide vaccine toward human clinical application, a novel particle-inducing
liposome system containing cobalt-porphyrin-phospholipid (CoPoP) will be used as an ultrapotent vaccine
adjuvant platform for Fba and Met6 peptides. In preliminary data, immunization of mice with liposome-displayed
Fba / Met6 peptides or two-peptide combination induced robust IgG responses and balanced Th1/Th2 immunity
or Th1-baised which would play a key role contributed to resistance to invasive candidiasis."
11010709,"BioSpyder proposes to develop and validate a classifier test for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) that may also
classify other dementias. This Diversity supplement will extend the scope to include a test for Parkinson’s
Disease (PD). BioSpyder intends to market these tests as RUO products initially, then pursue the development
of definitive in vitro diagnostic (IVD) tests, addressing a major unmet need. In Phase I, a classifier was
demonstrated using whole blood obtained from a finger-stick, spotted on filter paper, and assayed using the
whole transcriptome TempO-Seq® gene expression assay (the WBFP TempO-Seq assay). This approach
produced signatures for both AD and PD, enabling the construction of a classifier that initially identified each
with 87% accuracy. After retraining with additional AD samples, the WBFP TempO-Seq AD classifier identified
100% of an independent testing cohort of AD samples correctly and identified immune cell functional pathways
underlying the signature. AD is the most common form of dementia, with the risk of developing AD being 1 in 5
for women and 1 in 10 for men. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) can be noticed years before those patients
can be diagnosed with AD or another dementia, resulting in years of uncertainty, lack of treatment, and lost
time to prepare for a future with AD. That diagnosis requires cognitive testing administered by a neurologist,
preferably confirmed by a -amyloid PET scan. Biomarker immunoassays recently cleared under the
Breakthrough Device designation are not definitive and require cognitive testing or a -amyloid PET scan for
diagnosis, along with the need for drawing blood or collecting cerebral spinal fluid. Thus, the unmet need for a
definitive IVD persists. In this Phase II we will validate the performance of the WBFP TempO-Seq assay to
classify AD patients, ability to classify patients with other dementias, establish how early after presenting with
MCI patients can be identified with AD, correlate the WBFP TempO-Seq assay classification to -amyloid PET
scans and immunoassay, implement/validate performance of a focused WBFP TempO-Seq AD or pan-
dementia test, and prepare the materials for, and meet with, the FDA in a pre-IDE meeting to discuss the
studies required for an application for clearance as an IVD. The diversity supplement will carry this out for PD.
These tests will be marketed for RUO use to identify novel therapeutic targets, characterize the progression
from MCI to AD and PD, facilitate drug discovery efforts and aid in selection/classification of patients, and
potentially for development as companion diagnostic tests. If the WBFP TempO-Seq AD, PD, or pan-dementia
tests receive FDA clearance, they will be transformative, providing a definitive diagnosis of AD, PD, or other
dementias. This could potentially happen before a diagnosis through cognitive testing can be made, and
importantly, enabling self-collection of samples to address health disparities."
11009219,"Project Summary
In the context of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), both CD4+ T cells and macrophages contribute to the
viral reservoir within people living with HIV on combination antiretroviral therapy. Natural killer (NK) cells are the
major cytolytic cells of the innate immune system, and their failure to effectively eliminate infected cells allows
propagation and persistence of infection. In in vitro models of infection, HIV-infected macrophages are more
resistant to NK cell-mediated killing than their CD4+ T cell counterparts, implicating macrophage-specific
mechanisms of resistance. However, these mechanisms have yet to be determined. The overall objective of
this proposal is to define macrophage-specific mechanisms that facilitate increased resistance to NK cell-
mediated killing. The central hypothesis is that HIV-infected macrophages resist NK cell-mediated killing by
reducing immediate NK cell lytic function, and antagonizing death receptor signaling. To address this hypothesis,
the following aims will be pursued: Specific Aim #1 will characterize release of HIV-infected macrophage
lysosomal granules towards NK cells. Published work shows that melanoma cells being targeted by CD8+
cytolytic T lymphocytes release their lysosomes at the immunological synapse to degrade perforin, protecting
them from elimination. To measure lysosome release, the investigators used CD107a, which lines the membrane
of lysosomes and lytic granules and is surface-exposed following degranulation. My preliminary data shows that
HIV-infected macrophages increase surface CD107a expression upon co-culture with autologous NK cells.
Therefore, I will investigate whether this mechanism is also being used by HIV-infected macrophages to
neutralize NK cell degranulation. Specific Aim #2 will define mechanisms of HIV-infected macrophage
resistance to NK cell FasL-mediated killing. Preliminary data shows that HIV-infected macrophages, but not
CD4+ T cells, are not susceptible to apoptosis induced by incubation with recombinant FasL, despite both cells
expressing the receptor, Fas. I will investigate whether this resistance is due to increased anti-apoptotic activity
of cFLIP, which regulates caspase-8 activity. To complement these experiments, I will analyze published single-
cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets of human tissues to determine tissue resident macrophage
expression of cFLIP and other anti-apoptotic proteins. I will compare these results to scRNA-seq that I will
perform on my monocyte-derived macrophages as a comparator. Results from these studies will elucidate how
HIV-infected macrophages escape NK cell-mediated killing and will ultimately inform clinical strategies utilizing
NK cells to control pathogenesis. The work outlined above will be conducted at the University of Massachusetts
Chan Medical School, within the Immunology and Microbiology Ph.D. program. The training plan, which will help
me achieve my goal of becoming an independent investigator, includes coursework on basic/advanced principles
of immunology and ethics of research. Finally, I will attend national/international conferences to receive feedback
from external scientists on my research and engage with others performing cutting edge research."
11009288,"Summary
 An estimated that at the end of 2022, 39 million people were living with the Human Immunodeficiency
Virus (HIV). After early primary infection, HIV enters the central nervous system (CNS), where it remains
for the lifespan of the infected individual, principally for the generation of viral reservoirs. Half of the
people living with HIV showed cognitive decline, associated with cognitive impairment in the era of
effective antiretroviral therapy. The pathology of the HIV infection of the brain is characterized by
enhanced leukocyte infiltration, microglial activation, inflammation, neuronal dysregulation and loss,
and blood-brain barrier dysfunction. However, the mechanisms that mediate impairment are still not
fully defined. In this K01 we propose that tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) facilitate HIV toxicity and infection
within the CNS. I will examine a unique mechanism of viral reactivation mediated by TNTs.
 We and others have identified that HIV induces the formation of a novel cell-to-cell communication
system called TNTs during infection and reactivation. TNT, like Virological Synapses (VS), plays a key
role in HIV spread and immune/ART evasion. However, a major difference between VS and TNTs is
that TNTs are generated from viral reservoirs to uninfected cells, reaching distances up to 500 µm.
TNTs-mediated infection does not require cellular migration into areas with viral reservoirs or soluble
viruses because these long processes, TNTs, target infectivity. Our proposal will explore how HIV
induces TNT, its function, and the consequences of TNT in viral amplification and reactivation, as well
as they can provide an alternate route for HIV spread of toxicity and aggregated proteins associated
with neurological disorders. This novel and innovative application will provide a unique perspective on
the viral spread and reactivation mechanisms. Our central hypothesis is that “Viral reservoirs use TNTs
to spread infection and bystander neuronal/glial damage in the current ART era.” The innovation of the
proposed research is the integration of robust preliminary data. This K01 corresponds to a high-risk-
high-reward application because the presence of TNTs in HIV, its clinical relevance, and the in vivo
consequences of TNT inhibition are unknown and present gaps in knowledge. This award will provide
Dr. Valdebenito-Silva with the training and research support needed to successfully develop
her research and become a scientist in the neuroscience field, who has the recognition of their peers
as an independent investigator leader in this area of research. Furthermore, Dr. Valdebenito’s work
on the study of TNTs offers the potential to expand her research not only in studying other infectious
diseases, such as neurotropic viruses, but also into neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer."
11009390,"Project Summary:
Currently, there are over 40 million people living with HIV-1 worldwide. Although combination antiretroviral
therapy (cART) has improved the health and lifespan of millions of those living with HIV-1, long-term use of
antiretrovirals coupled with limited penetration of some of these medications into the CNS, is often accompanied
with neurocognitive impairments in at least 50% of infected individuals, commonly referred to as NeuroHIV.
Additionally, while cART can successfully suppress peripheral viremia, persistence of cytotoxicity viral protein
such as Transactivator of transcription (Tat) in tissues such as the brain, remains a significant concern. Adding
further complexity is the co-morbidity of drug use disorder in those infected with HIV-1, especially that of opiates.
While the direct combined effects of HIV Tat and Opiates involving astrocytic cytokines and chemokines on
neuronal injury are well studied, how morphine exacerbates aberrant glial-neuronal responses to Tat & HIV-1,
involving shuttling of microRNAs and reprogramming the neurons to a synaptically injured phenotype in is an
unmet need in the field and warrants investigation. Our preliminary findings suggest in human primary astrocytes/
A172 cells exposure to HIV Tat mediated the induction and release of miRNA-7 and exposure to morphine
mediated the upregulation and release of miR-23a in extracellular vesicles (EVs). Furthermore, neuronal uptake
of Tat and Morphine stimulated astrocyte EVs (containing miR-7 and 23a) resulted in exacerbated synaptic injury
compared to uptake by EVs with individual miR. These findings are backed by strong in vivo data demonstrating
morphine-mediated potentiation of synaptodegeneration induced by HIV Tat and also, reversal of synatic injury
by anti-miR. Taken together, the scientific hypothesis of this proposal is that HIV Tat/HIV-1 & morphine co-
operate to mediate exacerbated synaptic alterations involving: a) HIV Tat/ HIV-1-mediated release of astrocytic
EV miR-7 that downregulates its targets (NLGN2, GRIN2A, PBX3), & b) Morphine-mediated release of astrocytic
EV miR-23a downregulates its targets (NRGN, PCLO, NLGN1), in neurons. We will test the efficacy of
engineered, astrocyte specific AAVs expressing short hairpin RNA for -miR7 & -23a to restore HIV-1 Tat &
morphine-mediated synaptic impairments in two complementary in vivo rodent models of NeuroHIV: a) Inducible
brain Tat transgenic & b) infectious humanized mice administered opiates along with validation in archival
macaque brain tissues. These studies will make a significant contribution to our understanding of glial-neuronal
crosstalk, and the role of miRNAs in HIV and opiate-mediated synaptic neurodegeneration and will set a stage
for a future development of RNA therapeutics for these comorbid conditions."
11013570,"ABSTRACT
 Mortality from cryptococcal and TB-meningitis in individuals with HIV is unacceptably high and better
therapeutics are needed. The future landscape of treatment against these infections involves either
development of new therapeutics, which has been slow, and/or the optimization of current therapeutics with
improved formulations or dosing regimens. The CNS is a significant site of infection for these pathogens;
however, current understanding of drug penetration into the CNS is limited, based on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
concentrations. However, CSF is not brain tissue. Furthermore, pharmacokinetic targets for therapy have been
largely based on systemic or plasma concentrations with limited pharmacology assessments performed in CSF
or brain parenchyma. Improved understanding of drug exposure to and within the brain compartments where
pathogens reside, and how these exposures relate to pathogen clearance will be critical in the development
and optimization of effective regimens.
Our long-term objective is to reduce mortality from CNS infections. Herein, we aim to use
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics modeling to:
 1) define CSF drug concentrations or AUC/MIC ratios, that predict rate of fungal clearance
 2) determine the relationship between CSF drug concentrations and with inflammation, resistance,
 neurocognitive outcome, and survival
 3) determine drug distribution in brain parenchyma using post-mortem specimens
This project builds on existing research collaboration, infrastructure, and progress made with our R21
NS108344. This project represents a unique synergy between existing strengths of the study team members.
Early stage-investigator Melanie Nicol, PharmD, PhD has advanced training in clinical pharmacology and
performing drug distribution and pharmacokinetic studies. Robert Lukande, MMed, PhD is an experienced
pathologist who can provide expertise in the performance and interpretation of autopsies. Drs. David Meya and
David Boulware are leaders in cryptococcal and TB meningitis and lead multiple clinical trials in these areas,
allowing us access to research participants on a variety of drug regimens. The findings from this R01 are
expected to fill critical gaps in our understanding of the dose-concentration-response relationships of antifungal
and anti-TB drugs for the treatment of CNS infections in individuals with advanced HIV and ultimately reduce
mortality with improved regimens. The R01 will also support critical infrastructure and capacity building in
Uganda in regards to drug distribution assays and the implementation of autopsy procedures."
11013462,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The HIV-1 (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a member of the retroviral family which contains a single-stranded
RNA genome and is the major etiological agent involved in the development of acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome or AIDS. The WHO now estimates that in 2022 over 40 million people worldwide are infected.
Development of antiretroviral therapy (ART) provided much progress over the past several decades. Continual
emergence of drug resistance HIV variants and side effects of life-long therapy necessitates the development of
new agents and long-acting therapies to increase patient compliance. Developing PrEP prophylactic and
combination therapies would be highly beneficial as well as new approaches to reduce HIV reservoirs.
Successful drug targets include HIV reverse transcriptase (RT), HIV protease, integration, viral entry,
attachment, and capsid. Drugs targeting RT remain a cornerstone of AIDS therapy and are divided into two
classes: nucleoside inhibitors (NRTIs) and non-nucleoside inhibitors (NNRTIs). NNRTIs with improved safety,
pharmacological, drug resistance profiles, and dosing regimens are still needed. Building on the discovery of
potent novel lead compounds, using computational and structure-guided design, the PI and an established set
of collaborators, have used lead optimization to develop several new classes of novel NNRTIs. These NNRTIs
have excellent potency on WT and drug resistant strains of HIV, optimal pharmacological properties, synergy
with clinically relevant HIV drugs, and efficacy in AIDS hu-mouse models including long acting and extended-
release formulations. Comprehensive studies are described to further develop these compounds as preclinical
candidates as combination therapy and PrEP. We discovered that some of these NNRTIs have potent activity
working by a completely different mechanism involving Gag-Pol dimerization, premature HIV protease activation,
and CARD8-mediated inflammasome cell-killing of HIV-1 infected cells via pyroptosis. Studies are described to
develop this new class of Gag-Pol dimerizer NNRTIs as a complementary strategy to attack HIV reservoirs."

Nearly one-third of the United States population lives in areas with unhealthy levels of ambient ozone. Since
increased ozone levels are associated with respiratory problems in children, elderly, and patients with pre-
existing cardiopulmonary diseases, elucidating the cellular and molecular mechanisms of ozone-induced lung
injury is highly significant in terms of formulating therapeutic strategies. Ozone results in predominantly Type 2
(Th2) inflammatory responses including eosinophilic inflammation and mucous cell metaplasia that are also the
hallmarks of allergic asthma. While it is understood that interleukin 4 receptor α (IL4Rα, a common receptor for
IL4 and IL13) is essential for Th2 inflammatory responses, what is not clear is which IL4Rα-bearing cell-type is
indispensable for various outcomes in Th2-associated diseases. Lack of such knowledge is a major obstacle in
the development of effective therapeutic strategies, because, without it, the IL4Rα inhibitors will remain non-
specific and not fully effective, as is the case with ongoing clinical trials with IL4Rα inhibitors. Our central
hypothesis is that myeloid cell-specific Type II IL4R is essential for ozone-induced granulocyte recruitment
and the pathological manifestation of Th2-associated responses, and that the IL4Rα-bearing myeloid cells
release IL4 that regulates downstream IL4Rα signaling through Type I IL4Rα on non-myeloid cells. The
overall objective of this proposal is to delineate the myeloid cell-specific role of IL4Rα signaling in ozone-
induced airway disease and to identify myeloid-IL4Rα-mediated soluble and vesicle-bound mediators of
ozone-induced inflammation in airspaces.  In aim 1 we will employ myeloid-, macrophage-, and cDC-specific
IL4Rα deficient mice or myeloid-only-, macrophage-only-, and cDC-only-IL4Rα sufficient mice, to investigate
the role of myeloid-, macrophage-, and cDC-specific IL4Rα in ozone-induced granulocyte recruitment. In aim
2, we will test our hypothesis that mye-specific IL4Rα is required for IL4 production that, in turn, mediates the
downstream responses through Type I IL4Rα-receptor on non-myeloid cells. Furthermore, a comprehensive
analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage, both fluid and the vesicular fraction, will be performed to reveal the identity
of additional mediators released from IL4Rα-bearing myeloid and non-myeloid cells. In aim 3, The myeloid-
specific IL4Rα deficient mice (males vs females; neonates vs adults vs aged) will be exposed to ozone as well
as ozone superimposed with mixed allergens. This aim will reveal gender- and age-specific role of myeloid
IL4Rα in asthma outcomes. The findings from our studies will have a transformative impact on the mechanistic
understanding of the pathophysiology of ozone-induced airway disease. Eventually, these findings may be
applied towards the development of cell-specific therapeutics against ozone-induced as well as other Th2-
associated diseases."
11010453,"Millions of people are afflicted with Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD) every year. The lack of effective treatments to control these devastating diseases will result in a health, economic and social crisis in an aging society. Thus, numerous studies have been carried out to elucidate the molecular basis of AD/ADRD in the past few decades. Although the underlying mechanism remains enigmatic, it is well established that membrane damage by several proteins such as α-synuclein (α-syn) plays a critical role in disease progression and thus could be a potential target for therapeutic interventions. Despite extensive efforts to dissect the molecular mechanism of these protein-lipid interactions, effective drugs that can control them are scarce. We recently engineered a suite of nanodisc-based fluorescent probes that can robustly report the action of α-syn on the lipid bilayer. Building on these achievements, we now seek to further explore the use of this toolkit for modulator discovery to ameliorate membrane binding and remodeling activities of α-syn aggregates. If successful, the identified candidates will not only serve as valuable reagents to study the biology of α-syn, but also as potential therapeutics for AD/ADRD."
11012251,"This Merit proposal is part of a BLR&D Collaborative Merit Award for TBI (CTBI) proposal (RFP #BX-19-
006) involving three separate but integrated proposals that together investigate the mechanisms by which TBI
enhances impulsivity and suicidal behavior in Veterans. The rationale for the collaborative project is to combine
neurobiological mechanistic studies in animals with human imaging and biomarker analysis to understand the
manner in which TBI influences impulsivity and suicidal behavior. The overarching hypothesis is that TBI
enhances impulsivity, a risk factor for suicide particularly in response to stress, through inflammation and
dysfunction of the serotonin system and frontal lobe circuitry.
 Recent research increasingly highlights mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) as a risk factor for suicidal
thoughts and behaviors, including death by suicide. A study by Co-I Brenner found that Veterans with mTBI
died by suicide at 1.8 the rate of the general Veteran population. The elevated suicide risk in Veterans with TBI
is also consistent with previous research in civilians. Nevertheless, the study of suicide among those with mTBI
is limited and there exists minimal understanding of the mechanism underlying this enhanced suicide risk in
mTBI. There is a growing appreciation of the role of dysfunction in the circuits and white matter tracts
underlying decision making in individuals with mTBI and history of a suicide attempt. However, neuroimaging
studies examining the intersection of suicidal behavior and mTBI are limited. Moreover, how impulsivity and
mTBI influences the development of suicidal behavior is also unclear. This project aims to address this gap
with a neuroimaging project examining facets of impulsivity in Veterans with mTBI and a suicide attempt
history.
 The James J. Peters VA (JJPVA) site proposes to investigate in male and female OEF/OIF/OND Veterans
(n=140), the relationship of cognitive and behavioral impulsivity using a 2 (mTBI+/-) x 2 (history of suicide
attempt (SA)+/-) design approach. Specifically, we will be examining four groups of Veterans: mTBI+/ SA+,
mTBI+/SA-, mTBI-/SA+ and mTBI-/SA-. This project complements the animal studies being conducted at the
New Jersey VA site by utilizing the same paradigms in humans during fMRI: the Go/No-go (motor) and Delay
discounting (cognitive) task to assess impulsivity in both animals and humans. A primary objective of this study
is to characterize alterations in brain activity and functional connectivity related to motor and cognitive
impulsivity during fMRI in our four groups of Veterans. The secondary objective is to examine the relationship
between white matter integrity using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and dynamic causal modeling with data
from our two behavioral tasks of impulsivity performed during fMRI, along with psychometrically-validated
measures of impulsivity. The third objective will be to determine similarities and differences in impulsivity data
from animal TBI models and humans. All Veterans will receive rigorous diagnostic assessments, measures of
impulsivity, clinical assessments of suicidal behavior, and a MRI scan (including structural MRI, DTI, and fMRI
while performing impulsivity tasks). Blood will also be obtained for biomarker analysis, conducted by the
Indianapolis VA site. Identifying potential neurobiological biomarkers for heightened suicide risk in Veterans
with mTBI is essential for developing targeted care. The proposed research is translational as similar parallel
analyses will be performed in humans and animals for investigating common neuronal circuits activated by
impulsivity and genomic biomarkers."

11012441,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The GI training program of the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) remains dedicated to the preparation of
investigators committed to a career in GI biomedical research. This program continues to build on its extensive
past experience in training productive and committed digestive diseases investigators (>95% of trainees in past
10 years remain in academic GI). Fundamental features of the post-doctoral training format, the major
component of this program, include direct research participation in conjunction with a comprehensive program
of didactic instruction and enrichment activities to provide a deep foundation in biomedical science and modern
research techniques. In addition, continuation of a typically 1-2 year pre-doctoral laboratory research program
is proposed to attract promising underrepresented minorities, to careers in GI research at a critical juncture in
their careers.
Research Areas and Disciplines. The strength of the research base of this program encompasses a spectrum
of research interests. The majority of trainees will undertake training in laboratory research in which emphasis
is placed on the application of tools of molecular biology to GI research. Training is offered in several disciplines
central to the study of digestive diseases: Epithelial Biology, Developmental Biology, Immunology, Metabolism,
Host-Pathogen Interactions, Genetics, Cancer Biology, Stem Cell Biology, Systems Biology, the Microbiome,
and Tissue Engineering. For fellows undertaking training in clinical investigation, a rigorous preparation in
relevant quantitative sciences, including Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Biomedical Informatics and Population
Health, is provided. In all disciplines, updated formal work in the Responsible Conduct of Research is offered.
Level of Training, Background and Numbers of Trainees. This renewal proposes both post-doctoral and
pre-doctoral training. Post-doctoral training is offered to individuals holding M.D., M.D.-Ph.D. or relevant Ph.D.
degrees. Seven post-doctoral positions are requested: four post-doctoral fellows will begin training each year,
and remain in research training for a minimum of two years supported by this award. In addition, two positions
are requested to continue the pre-doctoral training fellowship for URMs completing an undergraduate degree or
enrolled in graduate or medical school, each student entering for a 1-2 year period.
Training Facilities. Research training will take place in the existing laboratories of the research mentors; a
group of 54 established investigators with extensive ongoing interactions. Laboratories are present at the MGH,
a large general hospital with more than 1,300,000 sq. ft. of space dedicated to research. In addition, training
opportunities will be available in laboratories elsewhere at Harvard, M.I.T., the Whitehead Institute, the Ragon
Institute, and the Broad Institute. Didactic educational programs will include those offered through the Harvard
Medical School, other affiliates of the Harvard Medical School, the Harvard School of Public Health, Harvard
University and M.I.T."
11012443,"Abstract
The postdoctoral Pediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes Training Program at the University of Michigan is
designed to recruit and provide high quality research training in one of two major tracks, Basic Science or
Clinical Investigation & Epidemiology to qualified candidates. Now on its 15th year, the theme of the Program is
developmental programming of disorders of glucose metabolism. The program is organized to complement the
established training program in clinical pediatric endocrinology for M.D.s, and for basic scientists pursuing a
career in endocrine related research, by providing 2 years of intensive postdoctoral training using a closely-
mentored research training program individually structured for each trainee. The program is actively supported
by 14 faculty from 11 UM Departments/Schools, all with extensive research and mentoring experience within
their respective areas of expertise. The Program also includes an extensive didactic component tailored to
each trainee’s educational background and research interests. Trainees initiating Basic Science research
complete a 3-month course designed to expose them to a variety of state-of-the-art techniques, as well as to
skills in performing hypothesis-driven, controlled research studies. Trainees in Clinical Investigation &
Epidemiology choose between Outcomes & Epidemiology or Clinical Research. They complete courses
leading to either a Master of Public Health in Biostatistics & Epidemiology or a Master of Science in Clinical
Research Design & Statistical Analysis. In addition to the formal curriculum, trainees attend weekly clinical and
research seminars, receive instruction preparing and delivering oral presentations, and instruction in ethical
conduct of research. Mentored research is supported the Medical School resources including the Centers of
Comprehensive Diabetes Research, Nutrition Obesity Research, Organogenesis, Human Growth and
Development, Comprehensive Metabolomic Center, Molecular & Behavioral Neuroscience Institute and the
Michigan Institute for Clinical and Health Research. To optimize each trainee’s potential for development of a
successful academic career, trainees are required to submit abstracts to national meetings, submit a first-
authored research manuscript, and apply for individual grant funding. Expansion of our Program will help
alleviate the critical shortage of successful Pediatric Endocrinologists and Pediatric Physician-Scientists."
11018855,"PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
 Stark racial/ethnic disparities are prevalent for infant mortality and birthing people mortality and
morbidity due to the interacting effects of systemic racism, homophobia, and transphobia that hinder protective
social determinants of health and barriers to affordable, high-quality, culturally competent, and affirming
prenatal and postnatal healthcare. The Rosie project has the potential to alter the way health information is
presented to vulnerable populations. Currently, some popular programs involve resource-intensive home visits
(limited in scale due to staff and cost constraints) or non-personalized text messages (may not directly address
an individual's questions). We developed Rosie the chatbot that addresses both of these possible limitations by
representing a scalable tool that can have widespread reach across geographies and is personalized and
responsive to an individual's specific informational needs. Our Parent Grant Specific Aims are: 1) Develop
technology for a chatbot, Rosie, that will provide health informational support to vulnerable mothers the
moment they need it; 2) Evaluate the use of Rosie on maternal and infant outcomes; and 3) Release an open-
source packet for the construction of a chatbot. This supplement proposes extensions of the Rosie software to
serve diverse sexual and gender minority (SGM) communities. Supplemental aims include: 1) Enable Rosie to
serve diverse sexual and gender minority (SGM) communities, and 2) Explore the feasibility and acceptability
of Rosie to serve diverse sexual and gender minority (SGM) communities. The supplemental activities extend
the potential impact of the Rosie mobile app by making the software resource more responsive to the needs of
SGM pregnant and new parents of color, accessible, interactive, and adaptable to the different needs of users,
community organizations, and health researchers. Furthermore, the Rosie software importantly removes
technical barriers associated with obtaining and constructing a chatbot that can be adapted to a variety of
communities and health needs."

 Chemotaxis occurs during a number of key physiological events including angiogenesis, embryonic
development and wound healing. It also contributes to disease progression in pathological conditions such as
cancer metastasis and arthritis. The goal of the current proposal is to reveal how biochemical reactions and
physical characteristics, such as membrane curvature, deformation, and assembly phase, interact with one
another in achieving dynamic, accurate yet highly efficient cell migration. Chemotaxis has been understood
mainly in the perspective of signal transduction, while if and how physical properties of membranes play a role,
and how they interact with signal transduction remain largely unknown. By newly developing and implementing
a series of molecular actuators that can directly probe membrane properties with high spatio-temporal precision
inside lively migrating cells, we will reveal an interplay between signal transduction and membrane mechanics.
What molecular mechanisms generate local membrane curvatures developing into filopodia and
lamellipodia? In sensing chemoattractants, cells polarize by undergoing asymmetric membrane deformation
consisting of filopodia and lamellipodia at the front, and membrane retraction at the rear. We recently found that
curvature-sensitive proteins are a missing link between actin cytoskeleton and membranes. The result made us
hypothesize that actin machinery and curvature sensing and remodeling proteins, when properly modulated in a
feedback loop, are sufficient to produce desired types of membrane deformations such as lamellipodia and
filopodia. We will thus identify a particular combination of Rho GTPases, actin regulators, and BAR proteins, and
the molecular logic thereof, that are responsible for formation of filopodia and lamellipodia.
How do signaling components in migrating cells respond to membrane deformation? Migrating cells
exhibit dynamic morphological changes at plasma membranes and nuclear envelopes “as a consequence” of
cytoskeletal rearrangement regulated by signal components. To explore a possibility that membrane deformation
talks back to cytoskeletal and signal components, we will deploy molecular actuators that can directly deform
membranes. We will then quantify subsequently emerging activity of signaling components such as receptor
tyrosine kinases, PI3K, and small GTPases, as well as transcription factors such as YAP and Elk.
How does the phase-separated cytoskeletal biomolecular condensate play a role in membrane
deformation? Actin networks can undergo formation of biomolecular condensates at the plasma membrane due
to weak multivalent interactions among actin regulators. To examine the physiological importance of such phase
separation events, we will adapt molecular techniques to assemble or disassemble the condensates. These
operations will uniquely achieve gain- or loss-of function manipulations without altering an amount of the
molecular constituents; what is altered is their physical assembly status. We will characterize cell migration
phenotypes before and after deploying phase manipulations."

 Spatial control of membrane traffic is essential for the morphogenesis and maintenance of polarized
cell types such as epithelia and neurons, and their physiological functions in tissue homeostasis and
neurotransmission. Loss of cell polarity and defects in membrane traffic underlie the pathogenesis of many
diseases including cancer, neurodegeneration and metabolic disorders. The RATIONALE for our studies is that
a mechanistic knowledge of the spatial organization and regulation of membrane traffic is critical for the design
of new treatments and regenerative therapies. Many advances have been made in understanding membrane
traffic at points of origin (protein sorting, vesicle formation) and destination (vesicle docking/fusion). However,
KEY CHALLENGES remain in understanding how long-range transport is spatially controlled en route to
destination. Our CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS is that septins, a unique family of GTP-binding proteins that
associate with distinct subsets of microtubules (MTs) and membrane domains, comprise a novel regulatory
module for the spatial guidance of membrane traffic. Recent findings from our laboratory show that septins
modulate motor (kinesins, dynein) interactions with MTs and membranes. Driven by these advances, we will
address KEY QUESTIONS about septin functions and the spatial control of membrane traffic in epithelia and
neurons. We will investigate whether there is specificity between septins and distinct routes of polarized traffic
(e.g., apical vs. basolateral). We will distinguish between septin roles in the spatial orientation of MTs and the
modulation of motor motility on MT tracks, which will be mechanistically studied with structure-function
approaches. Based on new evidence of septin association with endolysosomes, we will investigate how
lysosome trafficking and positioning is regulated by septins. We will test the hypothesis that endolysosomal
septins scaffold the recruitment and activation of dynein-dynactin, and examine whether septins are involved in
the coordination of kinesin and dynein motors. Lastly, we will investigate how septin association with MTs or
membranes is controlled, focusing on phosphorylation of septins by signaling kinases as a switch mechanism
between MT- and membrane-associated functions. We will pursue these projects using innovative tools and
cutting-edge approaches including in vitro reconstitution, single-molecule and super-resolution microscopy,
and 3D organoid culture. Outcomes will provide new insights into the mechanisms that direct the transport of
membrane vesicles and endolysosomes in response to morphogenetic and metabolic signals. The proposed
studies will also advance our understanding of septins as spatial regulators of intracellular organization,
bearing significance on diseases triggered and/or exacerbated by abnormalities in septin expression."

 Sjögren’s syndrome (SS), an autoimmune exocrinopathy of the salivary and lacrimal glands, affects ~ 4
million Americans, 90% of whom are women. SS is characterized by sialadenitis and dacryoadenitis,
decreased saliva (i.e., xerostomia) and tear production (i.e., xerophthalmia) and the presence in blood serum
of autoantibodies against Ro/SSA and La/SSB. Xerostomia and xerophthalmia in SS patients can lead to
periodontitis, yeast and bacterial infections, digestive disorders and vision deterioration that severely reduce
the quality of life for patients. Ultimately, chronic inflammation in SS leads to secondary autoimmune diseases,
tissue fibrosis and lymphoma. Therapy for SS is limited to symptom management through external hydration,
artificial saliva and tears and muscarinic receptor agonists that induce fluid secretion from residual exocrine
acinar cells. Such remedies are universally judged to be inadequate and thus, development of more effective
SS treatments is essential. Our research focuses on cell surface P2X7 and P2Y2 receptors for extracellular
ATP, the intracellular chemical form of energy that when released from damaged salivary glands initiate
inflammatory responses. Our studies show that P2X7R and P2Y2R antagonists enhance saliva secretion and
reduce lymphocytic foci in salivary glands of two different mouse models of SS. Antagonism of the P2X7R also
reduces lymphocytic accumulation in the lacrimal glands and increases tear secretion. These antagonists have
not been used to treat human SS, although P2X7R is upregulated in salivary glands of SS patients compared
to non-SS controls. P2X7R activation in salivary glands also induces maturation and release of IL-1β, an SS-
related cytokine that upregulates P2Y2R in immune and epithelial cells, suggesting that P2X7R and P2Y2R
contribute together to SS development. This project will investigate the ability of P2X7R and/or P2Y2R
antagonists to increase saliva and/or tear secretion and reduce sialadenitis and/or dacryoadenitis in mouse
models of SS. These findings will be validated by assessing P2X7R and P2Y2R expression in archived human
SS and control minor salivary gland biopsies and evaluating effects of P2X7R and/or P2Y2R antagonism in
freshly isolated human salivary and lacrimal gland cells. Specific Aim 1 will investigate the hypothesis that
P2X7R and P2Y2R play sequential roles in chronic sialadenitis and glandular dysfunction in SS mouse models
and can be antagonized to treat SS in vivo. Specific Aim 2 will investigate the hypothesis that P2X7R and
P2Y2R activation in lacrimal gland epithelial cells promotes dry eye disease in mouse models of SS. Specific
Aim 3 will investigate P2X7R and P2Y2R-mediated proinflammatory responses in human primary salivary and
lacrimal gland cells and human SS minor salivary gland biopsies. Successful completion of this proposal will
represent a critical step towards realization of the ultimate goal of targeting the P2X7R and/or P2Y2R to treat
SS in humans."
11037164,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of this administrative supplement is to request funds for a state-of-the-art isothermal calorimeter for
measuring the thermodynamics of protein-protein and protein-small molecule interactions of proteins that are
critical for supporting cytokinetic abscission for R35GM150519. Cytokinetic abscission is the physical separation
of daughter cells that concludes mitosis. Premature abscission in the presence of incompletely segregated
chromosomes can result in chromosome breaks that give rise to DNA damage and micronuclei which are
hallmarks of cancer. To ensure that the onset of cytokinetic abscission is synchronized with the completion of
upstream mitotic events, cells maintain a cell cycle checkpoint known as the abscission checkpoint. Cells arrest
abscission in the presence of mitotic errors such as trapped DNA in the intercellular bridge, mis formed nuclear
pores, under-replicated DNA, and tension at the intercellular bridge. In this proposal we take an innovative
multidisciplinary approach that combines structure function studies with cell-based assays to address major
outstanding questions underlying abscission checkpoint regulation, including how cells sense checkpoint
triggers, and how protective activities are coupled with abscission. In Focus 1, we will use a structure-function
approach to understand the mechanism whereby the ESCRT abscission machinery recruits and triggers novel
cellular autophagy pathways. In Focus 2 we will examine how the metabolic status of a cell can lead to post-
translational modification of abscission checkpoint proteins to alter the fidelity of abscission, providing the first
direct links between glucose metabolism and abscission checkpoint function. Taken together, this work will
provide essential mechanistic, molecular-level insight into how cells promote faithful abscission, how the
mistakes in abscission can lead to the development of cancer, and ultimately, suggest therapeutic strategies for
combatting cancer cell proliferation."
11035054,"Background: Biologic medications (biologics) are highly effective for diseases of the immune system, cancers,
and other conditions; however, their high expense is a barrier to care and a burden to the healthcare system.
Biologics cannot be exactly copied as “generic” medications. Biosimilars- similar, but not identical versions of
biologic medications- are approved with large potential cost savings. However, VA providers and patients have
concerns regarding biosimilar switching safety and effectiveness as disease-specific randomized controlled
trials are not required for approval. Significance/Impact: Antagonists to tumor necrosis factor-α (Anti-TNFs)
are the largest class of biologics with biosimilars where switching may be feasible to reduce costs; however
how to safely and effectively integrate their use in a manner acceptable to patients is unknown. This proposal
addresses the VA HSR priority of veteran safety, the ORD-wide research priority of increasing substantial real-
world impact of VA research, and uses cross-cutting HSR methods of health systems engineering through a
learning healthcare system. Innovation: Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are the 1st and 2nd
most common indications for Anti-TNFs in the VA and can serve as a model for a learning healthcare system
approach for mitigation of adverse events related to biosimilar switching. Specific Aims: Aim 1a: To compare
rates of adverse events in CD and UC patients continued on Anti-TNF originator to those switched to
biosimilar. Aim 1b: To compare rates of CD or UC exacerbation in patients continued on Anti-TNF originator
to those switched to biosimilar. Aim 2: To compare the accuracy and calibration of 2a) traditional regression
models vs. 2b) machine learning models for predicting medication related adverse event related to Anti-TNF in
VA users with CD and UC. Aim 3: To use deliberative democracy methods to engage Veterans, to elicit their
preference regarding “like"" medication switch programs with and without their knowledge and to develop
consensus around treatment approaches. Methodology: Aim 1 will be achieved through a retrospective
cohort study of CD and UC patients who received Anti-TNF from the national VA datasets from 2017-2019.
Adverse events and exacerbations will be determined using a combination of administrative data and manual
chart review. Analyses for Aim 1 will proceed by Poisson regression using GEE. Adjusted event rate ratios of
patients switched to biosimilar compared to those who continued on originator biosimilar will be calculated with
95% confidence intervals and Wald p-values will be derived from the regression model estimates. Prediction of
patients who have adverse events to Anti-TNF will inform selection of appropriate therapy, and guidance of
patients for biosimilar switching. For Aim 2, both traditional regression models and machine learning models
will be constructed to identify which model will be better for predicting Anti-TNF related adverse events.
Developing the best possible risk stratification tool by comparing these models will allow us to identify veterans
that are at risk of adverse events to improve both the quality and efficiency of veteran care. It is critically
important that VA policies incorporate the opinions of Veterans on ethically controversial issues that impact
their health. Aim 3 will employ deliberative democratic methods that offer a practical and reliable approach to
soliciting informed and considered opinions in complex policy issues. Democratic deliberation uses education
by experts and carefully structured deliberation among peers to deliver informed opinions and policy
suggestions from concerned stakeholders. Next Steps/ Implementation: This proposal is supported with
clinical partners: the national VA Inflammatory Bowel Disease Technical Advisory Group and Pharmacy
Benefits Management who will disseminate findings from this study through VA-specific biosimilar switch
clinical guidelines and VA-pharmacy prescription policy. Future studies will include pragmatic clinical trials of
other biosimilar biologics using the learning healthcare platform created in this proposal."

We request funds to purchase a Spinning Disk Microscope for fast multi-color 3D imaging. This equipment is
needed to achieve goals of the parent grant #R35 GM125028. Summary of the parent funded grant. A) We
will continue elucidating how specific molecular components of myosin II filaments, as well as those of other
contractile system proteins like a-actinin and formins, regulate cellular force production. B) We will determine
the roles, and specific differences in function, of the non-muscle and muscle paralogs of myosin II, a-actinin, and
potentially other sarcomeric proteins during both sarcomere formation and mitosis/cytokinesis (we have found
that some muscle paralogs re-localize from the sarcomere to the cortex during cell division). C) Finally, we will
use zebrafish embryos to test the hypotheses that come out of our in vitro experiments in vivo. Techniques
used in the parent project. 1) Instant Structured Illumination Microscopy (iSIM) is employed to discern
macromolecular complexes within cells, specifically to distinguish the motor-groups within myosin II filaments.
2) Spinning disk confocal microscopy is utilized to observe the dynamic changes in cellular processes, such as
retrograde actin flow and sarcomere assembly, influenced by the genetic or pharmacological manipulation of
contractile system components in zebrafish embryos. Scientific justification of the request. The spinning disk
confocal microscope has been instrumental in the study of cytokinesis and cell motility, favored over iSIM for its
lower light intensity requirements that prevent cell cycle arrest. In addition to dividing cells, we are also studying
a novel class of large extracellular vesicles we call ""blebbisomes"" that have their own myosin II-based contractile
systems and undergo continuous blebbing. Blebbisomes are studied using spinning disk confocal to avoid
phototoxicity, as they stop blebbing and moving during super-resolution imaging. These blebbisomes are
autonomous in motion, capable of secreting and internalizing vesicles, housing functional mitochondria and
organelles for independent function, and can even initiate apoptosis, with their dynamics investigated in cell
culture and zebrafish embryos to align findings across in vitro and in vivo model systems. Existing Equipment.
The Burnette lab's Visitech iSIM microscope, while capable of fixed and live cell imaging, often cannot image
dim samples or those with rapid movements due to its high photon requirement, leading to photobleaching and
phototoxicity. As such, we are reliant on a heavily used Yokogawa CSU-X1 spinning disk confocal in Vanderbilt’s
microscopy core for its rapid, multi-channel 3D volume acquisition with minimal photo-damage, as evidenced by
its extensive use the lab’s MIRA-funded projects. Requested equipment. The proposal requests a Nikon
spinning disk confocal microscope system with automatic focus, DIC, a Yokogawa CSU-X1 spinning disk, a
Hamamatsu ORCA-Fusion CMOS camera, and four solid-state lasers to facilitate high-quality, long-term time-
lapse imaging with minimal photo-damage."

Gene expression in bacteria is heterogeneous even within genetically identical cells due to the stochastic
activation of many gene regulatory programs. The resulting phenotypic diversity often plays an important
functional role for bacterial communities, for example, facilitating horizontal gene transfer. This fundamentally
single-cell behavior cannot be resolved with population level measurements and, so far, has been studied in
pure cultures of genetically tractable organisms using low-throughput reporter-based assays. However, the
majority of bacteria in nature reside in complex microbial communities spatially organized into biofilms and
composed of multiple interacting members. Within such communities, a multitude of behaviors emerge from the
dynamic interplay of noisy gene expression states and responses to the heterogeneous microenvironment.
Absence of approaches for measuring phenotypic states within complex polymicrobial communities
simultaneously at systems scale and with single-cell resolution results in a lack of mechanistic understanding of
bacterial ecology and is therefore a critical barrier for the fields of microbiology and microbiome studies. During
my postdoc, I developed a high-throughput bacterial single-cell transcriptomics technology, microSPLiT
(microbial Split-Pool Ligation Transcriptomics), that allows to measure gene expression states in tens of
thousands of individual cells using only common laboratory equipment. In my lab, I aim to further extend
microSPLiT for single-cell transcriptomics of biofilms, as well as of complex bacterial consortia. Specifically, in
my first project we will create a single-cell gene expression map of single- and dual-species biofilms of
Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus by a combination of spatial single-cell RNA sequencing
and time-lapse imaging. We will characterize where and how the specialized phenotypic subpopulations emerge
at different stages of biofilm development and how they change in response to competing species. In the second
project, we will interrogate the functional role of the intermittent and heterogeneous activation of diverse
metabolic and stress response pathways which we have observed even in isogenic cells and in absence of
external cues. Specifically, we will test the hypothesis that heterogeneous sampling of such states may promote
inter-species interactions with bacterial partners evolved to coexist in the same environment. In this project, I
aim to uncover the phenotypic subpopulations arising in key species from human gut microbiota grown either
solo or in pair-wise combinations with other co-occurring species. With these data, we will use gene regulatory
network modeling to predict the higher-order interactions between gut microbiota species and engineer higher
complexity consortia with predictable behavioral traits. The results will pave the way toward building systems-
level understanding of the phenotypic structure and the emergent properties of a higher complexity natural
microbiota. Overall, the developed approaches will become widely applicable tools for microbiological research
and the acquired data will provide a foundation for high-resolution functional analyses of microbiota and biofilms."

The development of microbial resistance to antimicrobial agents is one of the biggest public health issues of the
21st century. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) cause more than 2.8 million antibiotic-resistant infections in the
U.S. each year, and more than 35,000 people die as a result. The principal ways of antibiotic resistance
development are related to the intrinsic bacteria's ability to evolve rapidly through mutations to either modify
these targets or the pathways for their synthesis, alter or degrade the antibiotic, or pump the antibiotic out of the
cell. Moreover, of critical importance is that all of these resistance mechanisms are encoded by antibiotic
resistance genes (ARGs), which are stable molecules encoded in the DNA and can be passed to daughter cells
or transported by horizontal gene transfer to neighboring pathogens. Despite tremendous efforts utilizing a wide
range of antibiotic discovery platform strategies, their success has been at best incremental. Therefore, there is
a critical need to develop effective approaches to simultaneously eliminate both ARB and ARGs. Recently, the
use of nanomaterials with antimicrobial activity has been explored as a new alternative against ARB and ARGs.
Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have been reported to have myriad applications as antimicrobial agents. In
addition, photodynamic inactivation (PDI) is also a feasible strategy to eliminate ARB and ARGs. The remarkable
features of AgNPs such as large surface area, capability to carry and release Ag+ ions, and ability to modulate
the microbial influx/efflux pumps; and PDI like efficient generation of ROS and the fact that does not generate
further resistance make these treatment modalities a promising alternative for the inactivation of ARB and ARGs.
We hypothesize that by combining both approaches, PDI and AgNPs, in the same platform a synergistic effect
to eliminate ARB and destroy ARGs will be achieved. The main goal of this project is to develop a light-activated
silver nanoparticulate system for the effective treatment of ARB and ARGs. This project consists of three aims:
in Aim 1, we will synthesize and characterize protoporphyrin IX (PpIX)-loaded AgNPs. This aim will demonstrate
that fabricating a rationally designed AgNP platform will enable a large payload of PpIX to be carried in a stable
formulation with tunable surface properties. For Aim 2, we will investigate the chemical and colloidal stability of
PpIX-AgNP materials under different culture medium and light irradiation conditions. This aim will provide key
information for the optimization of the platform and the influence of the environment on the generation of ROS
and Ag+ ions. Finally, in Aim 3, we will study the antimicrobial efficacy of PpIX-AgNPs against a panel of ARB,
the ARGs degradation kinetics and the nanoparticles cytotoxicity in mammalian cells. The information obtained
in this aim will allow us to move forward this platform to therapeutic applications."
11035856,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The long-term objectives of our research program are to (i) discover novel bacterial natural products
(NPs), (ii) elucidate the biosynthetic pathways and regulatory mechanisms of these NPs, and (iii) characterize
and utilize the discovered NPs and their biosynthetic enzymes for biomedical and biotechnological applications.
NPs are highly functionalized and evolutionarily optimized small molecules that possess unrivaled chemical
and structural diversities, resulting in a wide range of biological activities. Terpenoids, the largest and most
structurally diverse family of NPs, are considered rare in bacteria; only ~1.2% of known terpenoids are of
bacterial origin. However, genomics studies revealed that the biosynthetic enzymes responsible for terpenoid
biosynthesis are widely distributed in bacteria, particularly actinobacteria. We hypothesize that (i) bacterial
terpenoids are considerably underestimated among current NP libraries and the discovery and characterization
of novel terpenoids will lead to new drug leads and (ii) understanding the sequence-structure-function
relationships of terpenoid biosynthetic enzymes will lead to new opportunities in genome mining, combinatorial
biosynthesis, and oxidative biocatalysis. Our initial efforts follow two research directions that address
immediate needs and will set the stage for continued success in the field of terpenoid discovery and
biosynthesis. In the first direction, we will use an integrated genomics–metabolomics approach to discovery
novel bacterial terpenoids from bacteria. This will include the development of new and innovative
methodologies for targeted identification of complex bacterial terpenoids and the activation or upregulation of
terpenoid biosynthetic gene clusters. In the second direction, we will elucidate the biosynthetic pathways of
both new and known bacterial terpenoids and functionally, mechanistically, and structurally characterize
terpene synthases and their associated oxidative enzymes, particularly cytochrome P450s. We will use a
rigorous multidisciplinary approach involving genome mining, bioinformatics analysis, in vivo pathway
engineering, (un)natural product isolation and structural determination, in vitro enzymology, and protein X-ray
crystallography. Our experience in terpenoid biosynthesis and enzymology and our significant progress in
both research directions supports the feasibility of the proposed research and that we are well-suited to
establish and sustain a successful independent program in this field. In addition, we have established several
key collaborations with leaders in the fields of synthetic biology, NP drug discovery, and X-ray
crystallography that further strengthen this research program. Expected outcomes of this research program
include the revelation of the bacterial terpenome, understanding the underlying principles of how terpene
synthases dictate terpene cyclization, and the exploitation of naturally evolved oxidative enzymes to create a
toolbox of biocatalysts."

My group seeks to understand, in molecular detail, the steps taken by each of the major classes of membrane
proteins to achieve their ﬁnal assembled state. About one-quarter of all genes code for membrane proteins
that are ﬁrst inserted into the plasma membrane of prokaryotes or the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of
eukaryotes. These proteins perform many essential functions as receptors, channels, enzymes, anchors and
transporters. Biosynthesis of membrane proteins is an inherently ineﬃcient process, and numerous human
diseases are linked to defective folding of membrane proteins. Thus, understanding how membrane proteins
are made is a fundamental question in cell biology with important implications for the treatment of human
diseases.
 Of the ~5,000 membrane proteins coded in the human genome, the majority have more than one
transmembrane domain. Yet our understanding of how these “multi-pass” proteins are inserted, folded and
assembled into functional entities is at an early stage. Work in my group over the past several years led us to
discover a novel ~390 kDa translocon in the ER that is involved in the biogenesis of most multi-pass
membrane proteins in human cells. We are now focused on deﬁning the molecular mechanisms underlying
this process, using an interdisciplinary set of biochemical, structural, cell biological, genetic and bioinformatic
approaches. These studies promise new insight into the fundamental biological challenge of membrane
protein biogenesis."
11035894,"Project Summary
 The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop a strategy to manipulate single mRNAs
in live cell and use it to study post-transcriptional gene regulation, which is essential for cells to
restrict proteins synthesis at the right time and place. It becomes a leading research focus
because of its importance in learning, memory, development and other fundamental biological
processes. Despite decades of research, the spatiotemporal dynamics of post-transcriptional
regulation is poorly understood. This is due to the lack of experimental tools to control gene
expression with high temporal resolution in subcellular compartments, such as leading edges of
moving fibroblasts, anterior or posterior poles of developing oocytes, neuronal growth cones or
dendritic spines. In this work, we propose to develop strategies to regulate gene expression at
the single mRNA level in subcellular compartments. To achieve this goal, we will create
optogenetic and chemigenetic tools to control single RNAs in live cells. First, we will use light-
induced or chemical-induced dimerizer to tether protein factors onto target RNAs. Because
proteins control the RNA metabolism, this allows us to regulate the fate of single mRNAs or modify
the coded protein anywhere in a cell by precisely manipulating laser illumination or administering
small molecules. Second, we will use chemically-modified light-sensitive guide RNA for the
recently developed programmable RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas13 technology. We plan to
develop a light inducible RNA knock-down method and RNA binding proteins to modulate any
endogenous RNA. We will use the technology to study the decay mechanism by synchronously
induction of rapid RNA degradation. Combined with previously developed single mRNA
translation assay in our lab, we will investigate the interplay between translation and decay
machineries. By controlled RNA editing, we will visualize the distribution of newly synthesized
proteins from single mRNAs in neuronal dendrites.
 Gene expression regulation plays a central role in all biological problems. The tool that the
PI proposed here represents the ultimate spatiotemporal precision that one can manipulate when
and where a gene is expressed. It is comparable to RNA interference technology, with added
advantages of subcellular resolution, activating, repressive, and mRNA editing capability. The
molecular biological reagents and microscopy tools will be applicable to a broad range of scientific
community. This will allow us to address questions that cannot be answered before."

Despite substantial advancements in small-molecule catalysis, general methods to control the stereoselectivity
in radical-mediated transformations remain a formidable challenge facing synthetic chemists. On the other hand,
enzymes are known for their ability to exert exquisite control over the stereochemical outcome of the reactions
they catalyze. However, the catalytic repertoire of enzymes has been largely limited to their native biochemistry.
Using an interdisciplinary approach combining ideas and technologies from organic chemistry, organometallic
chemistry, biocatalysis, enzyme engineering and computational modeling, we will reprogram naturally occurring
metalloenzymes to catalyze unnatural radical reactions with excellent stereoselectivity. Capitalizing on the innate
redox property of metallocofactor present in a plethora of natural metalloproteins, we will develop metalloredox
radical biocatalytic reactions with significant synthetic utility. First, we will develop new-to-nature metalloredox
atom transfer radical addition reactions that proceed with excellent diastereo- and enantiocontrol. Second, we
will advance stereoselective radical additions to aromatic compounds in a metalloenzyme-controlled fashion.
Furthermore, enantioselective C-H functionalization reactions involving enzymatically formed nitrogen-centered
radicals will be developed. All the three aims are supported by strong preliminary data gathered in our laboratory.
Together, these novel metalloredox biocatalytic processes constitute a powerful toolbox for the rapid assembly
of diverse bioactive small molecules that are highly valuable in biomedical sciences. Furthermore, the
development of new-to-nature catalytic functions will dramatically broaden the biochemical landscape of
metalloenzymes."

Natural product leads from marine life continue to inspire new drugs, with nine approved for
clinical use since 2010. A historical challenge with developing marine organism-derived bioactive
chemicals has been one of limited supply. Often, natural drug leads are isolated from rare or
environmentally sensitive marine invertebrates and algae, which challenges the pre-clinical
evaluation of promising candidates when demands outweigh natural supplies. Some terrestrial
plant-derived drugs can now be produced in genetically engineered microbial cell factories, an
approach that would be attractive for marine-derived molecules. However, the biosynthetic
machinery responsible for the biosynthesis of bioactive natural products in marine animals and
algae is largely unknown. Until now. We have discovered and validated the first steps of
biosynthetic pathways in corals and algae that lead to over 6,000 terpenoids, including the anti-
inflammatory pseudopterosin and anticancer halomon. We propose a multidisciplinary project to
investigate the molecular basis of terpenoid diversification in marine eukaryotes that harbor
terpenoids with promising biological properties. Significant outcomes of this research project will
include a new paradigm for terpenoid biosynthetic logic in marine eukaryotes, and the application
of this basic knowledge toward the microbial production of marine animal and algal molecules.
We propose three specific aims, namely: 1) To develop a marine eukaryotic genome mining
platform for algae and corals; 2) To functionally characterize marine eukaryotic terpene synthases
for high yield terpene production; and 3) To discover and characterize terpene tailoring enzymes
(halogenation/oxygenation) associated with bioactive coral and algal natural products."

 Quorum sensing is a method of cell-cell communication used by bacteria to detect and
respond to changes in population density and control behaviors that benefit the group for
adaption and survival in their environment (e.g., symbiosis and pathogenesis). My research
program is focused on how bacteria use quorum sensing signaling to control expression of
virulence genes. Toward this goal, we study quorum sensing gene regulation in Vibrio species,
both as relevant pathogens and as established quorum sensing model systems. We focus on
the master Vibrio quorum sensing transcription factor LuxR, which is conserved in all Vibrio
species and is the core regulator of hundreds of genes. My research group uses biochemical,
biophysical, molecular biology, and physiological assays to dissect the LuxR mechanisms of
regulation in multiple Vibrio species. These experiments are the foundational components of my
research program. We routinely perform assays that require a standard refrigerated superspeed
centrifuge: DNA isolation, cell washing, competent cell preparations, protein purification, and
protein concentration.
 I am requesting funds to purchase a Sorvall Lynx 6000 superspeed refrigerated
centrifuge and rotors. Purchase of the Sorvall Lynx will expand my lab’s repertoire of assays,
increase our productivity, replace old and failing equipment, and eliminate costs for repairs of
our current under-performing tabletop centrifuge. We will improve our current biochemical
assays with increased throughput by expanding our ability to pellet cells in larger volumes and
at higher speeds. A new, reliable centrifuge with larger capacity will ensure that our lab can
continue its high level of productivity without the frequent repairs and down-time of our existing
centrifuge."
11035285,"Project Summary
Despite the high prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), there are currently no approved
medications to treat NAFLD. Metformin is frequently discussed as a promising treatment for NAFLD but reports
on the efficacy of metformin in NAFLD patients are not consistent. Hence, the effect of metformin on hepatic lipid
metabolism and the underlying mechanisms warrant further research. Metformin is thought to directly regulate
hepatic lipid metabolism via activating hepatic AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which subsequently
inhibits de novo lipogenesis and promotes fatty acid oxidation in liver. However, there is a lack of quantitative
assessment of to what extent hepatic lipogenesis or fatty acid oxidation is affected by metformin in vivo. In
addition, due to high concentrations of metformin in the intestine, the intestine has emerged as an important
action site of metformin. Dr. Huang generated intestinal epithelium-specific AMPK alpha 1 knockout mice and
observed that the beneficial effect of metformin was attenuated in these mice (Nature Communications 2022),
suggesting that the action of metformin in intestine is required for correcting dietary-induced metabolic disorders.
Due to the pleiotropic effects of metformin, omics analysis such as metabolomics, lipidomics, and 13C isotope
tracing will be required to quantitively and systemically assess the metabolic effects of metformin in different
organs. In a pilot study, I performed metabolomics and lipidomics analysis using liquid chromatography coupled
to high resolution mass spectrometer (LC-HRMS). The preliminary data suggest that the number of metabolites
and lipids altered by metformin positively correlated with concentrations of metformin in these tissues, and
metformin-induced metabolic and lipidomic changes were more profound in intestine due to the high
concentration in intestine. We also synthesized a metformin probe containing an alkyne group, which will be
used to identify the molecular target of metformin. In the next five years, I will combine my expertise in omics
analysis with metformin probe and genetically modified mice developed by Dr. Huang to test the hypothesis that
metformin induces beneficial metabolic and lipidomic alterations in intestine, enhances intestinal functions (e.g.,
sugar clearance) and subsequently shields liver from dietary-induced damage. The immediate goal of this
project is to elucidate the action site and underlying mechanisms through which metformin protects the liver
against high fructose-induced metabolic damage. The long-term goal is to 1) develop strategies to enhance the
metabolic capacity of intestinal epithelial cells for alleviating liver steatosis and 2) to provide insights into
identifying NAFLD patients who likely benefit from metformin monotherapy and developing optimal strategies to
prevent or treat NAFLD. Even though this proposed study is focused on metformin in the context of dietary-
induced liver disease, methods and discoveries in this study are expected to make a broad impact in diseases
with dysregulated metabolism."
11035286,"Health issues associated with liver diseases afflict millions of individuals and account for over 70,000 deaths
annually in the United States. Due in part to an aging population, liver diseases are expected to rise
significantly over the next two decades, increasing the need for more effective treatment therapies and
increased success rates with transplants. Unfortunately, there are no effective treatments to curb the pathology
and there remains a shortage of available livers for transplantation. This challenge is further compounded with
alloreactive responses leading to transplant rejection. However, a viable solution is the use of a model liver
systems that accurately mimic the biomechanical and biochemical functioning of in vivo liver tissue.
Additionally, alternative methods to expand recipient autologous hepatic cells while maintaining function would
serve as efficient methods to generate liver systems for transplantation. However, while liver models for in vivo
use have been attempted, none have yet successfully expanded autologous hepatic cells in vitro followed by
successful implantation to alleviate liver failure in recipients using an in vivo model system. My laboratory has
recently demonstrated success in this approach, where we have established an effective in vitro 3D hepatocyte
culture system for rapid expansion. Furthermore, our preliminary work shows great promise in applying the
system for in vivo adoptive implantation using our innovative in-house designed 3D scaffold system. Therefore,
this proposal's objective is to develop a method for rapid expansion of hepatic cells in a novel 3D printed
bioscaffold for assembly of a liver organoid for in vivo tissue restoration and ex vivo drug screening. The
central hypothesis is that primary hepatic cells seeded in a novel biomaterial scaffold will display similar
metabolic function, structure, and biomechanical properties to that of the original liver tissues. The success of
this approach will restore liver function following transplantation in a liver-damaged mouse model. The
innovative combination of rheological biomaterial tuning, 3D bioprinting, and culture methods that utilize a
novel bioscaffold will be applied in pursuit of two specific aims: 1) Engineering an ex vivo model for screening
therapeutic drugs targeting hepatocytes through 3D printed bioscaffolds and 2) Development of an implantable
hepatic organoid for in vivo tissue restoration to alleviate liver failure in a mouse model. Dedicated equipment
for high resolution bulk rheological measurements will support 1) characterization of liver viscoelasticity
through bulk shear rheology 2) evaluation of complex moduli of hepatocytes growing in a novel biomaterial,
and 3) correlation of multiscale structural information to bulk data. These investigations will establish a platform
for novel mechanically tuned 3D culture systems for both rigorous in vitro diagnostic screening and for in vivo
adoptive transfer approaches to physiologically restore failed liver function. The proposed work is significant as
the anticipated results will establish a platform for future investigations utilizing the biomaterial 1) for
engineering cell seeded scaffolds to restore tissue function and 2) in pursuit of drug discovery."
11035469,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Chemical synthesis has long benefited public health through the discovery and preparation of
pharmaceuticals, the synthesis and study of natural products, and the development of new methods for drug
delivery among many others. The continuation and acceleration of such contributions requires the
development of new chemical methods with a focus on increasing selectivity, efficiency, practicality and
scalability, and the ability to access diverse and novel chemical space. Our laboratory focuses on the creation
of new chemical methods, novel reagents, and the total synthesis of bioactive natural products. Each project
focuses on filling a key gap in the literature while delivering end products that will be of immediate and practical
use to the scientific community, both in the context of fundamental chemistry and translational drug discovery.
 This proposal combines two distinct, but thematically linked, programs that share the overarching goal
of developing novel methods and reagents to enable new chemical transformations and explore new chemical
space with direct applications to medicinal chemistry, natural product synthesis, and drug discovery. The first
section of the proposed work will develop new methods that allow for the efficient installation of sulfonimidoyl
moieties onto both simple and complex scaffolds and the use of sulfonimidoyl-containing reagents for the
syntheses of otherwise difficult-to-access chemical space including pharmaceutically relevant spirocycles and
natural products. Among the methods in this proposal are the synthesis and applications of sulfoximines as
asymmetric molecular transfer reagents, the use of sulfoximines as chiral anion stabilizing groups for anion
relay chemistry, the development of modular syntheses of sulfonimidoyl fluorides and chiral bifunctional
sulfonimidoyl linchpin reagents. In the second section, diazirines are developed as unique nitrogen transfer
reagents, which react with a wide variety of chemical handles including carboxylic acids, unactivated C–H
bonds, alcohols, and α-positions. The products of these reactions, diaziridines, are versatile heterocycles that
are easily transformed in one step to high-value amines, hydrazines, and nitrogen-containing heterocycles.
This chemistry will be applied in the target-oriented synthesis of hydrazine, hydrazide, and piperazic acid-
containing natural products, asymmetric transformations, and the synthesis of novel probes for proteomics.
The chemistry developed throughout this proposal will enhance the discovery and development of new small
molecule therapeutics across disease states in both academic and industry."
11035481,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Lysosomes play essential roles in cell physiology, not only controlling nutrient recycling and cellular growth, but
also mediating the proper handling of various cellular stress. Lysosomal dysfunction is associated with aging
and many diseases such as lysosomal storage disease, neurodegeneration, and cardiovascular diseases. A
hallmark of lysosomal-related diseases is lysosomal membrane permeabilization/damage (LMP) which if not
immediately resolved can cause detrimental problems including cell death. We now start to understand that LMP
triggers multiple cellular pathways to repair damaged lysosomes. However, none of the previously described
pathways appear to be essential for rapid lysosomal repair, suggesting additional repair mechanisms. As an
attempt to find such mechanism, we recently designed and executed an unbiased proteomic screen searching
for proteins specifically enriched on damaged lysosomes. This screen led to the discovery of the
phosphoinositide-initiated membrane tethering and lipid transport (PITT) pathway as an essential mechanism
for rapid lysosomal repair. We found that LMP stimulates robust production of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate
(PtdIns4P, PI4P) on damaged lysosomes by type II alpha phosphatidylinositol-4 kinase (PI4K2A). Lysosomal
PI4P drives the formation of extensive membrane contacts between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and
damaged lysosomes by recruiting multiple oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP)-related protein (ORP) family
members. The ORPs catalyze subsequent ER-to-lysosomal transport of cholesterol and phosphatidylserine
(PS) to mediate rapid membrane repair. While cholesterol by itself increases membrane stability, PS activates
ATG2-mediated lipid transport for direct lysosomal repair. The PITT pathway is activated in response to diverse
disease-related lysosomal-damaging conditions and is expected to have enormous impact on human
pathophysiology. Remarkably, the PITT pathway not only reveals lipid transfer at membrane contacts as a
essential mechanism for lysosomal repair, but it also establishes lipid remodeling as a new platform to
understand lysosomal quality control. Through three independent projects in the next five years, our lab will
continue studying LMP-triggered lysosomal lipid remodeling for better mechanistic understanding of lysosomal
quality control and potential therapeutic applications. First, we are purifying lysosomes during and after
lysosomal repair to characterize lipid changes by lipidomics, which we believe will identify new lipid messengers
important for lysosomal quality control. Second, the PITT-mediated lysosomal cholesterol accumulation provides
a great cellular model to study cholesterol transport, and we are particularly interested in the mechanism for
cholesterol egress from newly repaired lysosomes. Finally, we are also performing chemical screens using FDA-
approved chemical library to search for small molecules that activate or block the PITT pathway. The identified
small molecules have well established protein targets, which will help define the regulatory networks for the PITT
lysosomal quality control pathway as well as delineate new strategies to improve lysosomal quality."

 The Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway is essential for oxidative and xenobiotic responses
and is related to many diseases especially cancer. To understand the impact of environmental
toxins on development and health at the molecular level, my laboratory investigates the
molecular mechanisms and biological functions of the Keap1-Nrf2 oxidative and xenobiotic
response pathway in Drosophila. Supported by the current R15 fund, we aim to characterize the
molecular and biological interactions between dKeap1/CncC and chromatin remodeling
proteins, including lamin, actin, NURF, and JIL-1. Additionally, we plan to identify developmental
genes directly targeted and regulated by dKeap1 in a redox-independent manner. Furthermore,
we will study the formation and function of dKeap1-induced condensates. Finally, we will test the
hypothesis that dKeap1 and/or CncC mediate developmental adaptations to xenobiotic stimuli
through epigenetic regulation of chromatin architecture. This research is also expected to
enhance undergraduate education in both the classroom and laboratory settings.
All these research plans involve numerous fluorescence imaging assays, such as
immunostaining and live imaging. Therefore, an advanced fluorescence microscope is essential
for the ongoing projects in our lab. Unfortunately, the only fluorescence microscope shared by
our department is outdated and dysfunctional. Currently, we are utilizing a campus-shared

that is easily accessible. Additionally, the acquisition of this equipment will significantly enhance
the research capabilities of other faculty members within the Biology Department at the
University of Minnesota Duluth."

The overarching goal in this proposal is to understand how molecular motions and biophysical properties
modulate protein interactions to promote normal homeostasis or pathological disease states. We investigate the
relationship between protein dynamics and interactions in three contexts: 1) protein–fibrillar collagen interactions
involved in platelet aggregation; 2) α-synuclein (αS), an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) whose misfolding
and aggregation into amyloid fibrils and deposition into Lewy bodies are associated with debilitating
synucleinopathies, such as Parkinson’s Disease; and 3) the spike glycoprotein of the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), whose interaction with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) via the
receptor binding domain (RBD) is the initial point of host cell entry. We have recently discovered that in each of
these cases, conformational dynamics profoundly impact their atomic-to-nano scale properties and may affect
their potential for biomolecular interactions. Despite the biological importance of these systems and the
implications for their interactions on disease, the molecular determinants of these protein–protein interactions
remain unanswered. Thus, we use a multifaceted approach integrating solution and solid-state NMR with
biophysical, biological, and computational methods to address how molecular motions modulate protein
interactions to promote normal homeostasis or pathological disease states. Gaining a molecular understanding
of protein–protein interactions with each of these dynamic systems relies on state-of-the-art solution NMR
instrumentation to be able to accurately measure timescales and fluctuations of these interaction events and to
detect transient, lowly populated complexes."
11035297,"Elucidating the role of the Integrated Stress Response pathway in tissue homeostasis
Metazoa have evolved stress response pathways to combat internal and external stressors (e.g.,
nutrient deprivation, changes in environmental conditions, toxic insults). The Integrated Stress
Response (ISR) is one such evolutionarily conserved pathway that mediates adaptation to cellular
stress. Since its discovery in yeast, much effort has been dedicated to studying the role of ISR signaling
in mediating the cellular response to exogenous stress. In higher organisms, many specialized cell
types have evolved to rely on the ISR to maintain homeostasis: notable examples of this include
metabolically active cells such as hepatocytes and adipocytes, highly secretory cells such as b-islet
cells of the pancreas, and neurons with high protein turnover such as photoreceptors. Our current
understanding of ISR signaling in maintaining tissue homeostasis largely comes from phenotypic
observations in loss-of-function mutants, yet little is known about the underlying molecular and cell
biology of such regulation. This proposal seeks to gain new insights into the precise molecular and cell
biological mechanisms governed by ISR signaling in maintaining tissue homeostasis. We will use the
Drosophila fat tissue and ovary as a discovery platform, owing to the breadth of genetic and molecular
biology tools available for manipulation of these tissues.
 The different branches of ISR signaling culminate in the highly conserved transcription factor,
ATF4. We recently described a role for Drosophila ATF4 in the regulation of oogenesis. Our preliminary
data revealed that while some of the oogenesis defects (e.g., oocyte maturation) arise from
autonomous requirement for Atf4 in the ovary, several others (e.g., yolk protein accumulation, egg
laying) are mediated tissue non-autonomously by Atf4 in the fat tissues surrounding the ovary. Based
on these data, we test a role for ISR signaling as a fat tissue metabolic sensor, which informs peripheral
tissue function non-autonomously. Leveraging our extensive background in molecular and cell biology
techniques with powerful Drosophila genetic tools, we will pursue three projects to establish the role for
ISR signaling 1) in regulating steroid hormone signaling in fat tissues, 2) in fat tissue-mediated
neuromodulation, and 3) in the mRNA translational control in the ovary. Gaining molecular
understanding of the role for the ISR in tissue homeostasis will fundamentally inform our approach to
experimentally and therapeutically improve tissue function. The advancements from this study will also
bear vast pathobiological relevance since ISR dysregulation is associated with an ever-increasing
number of diseases, from diabetes to neurodegeneration and cancer."

11037355,"PROJECT SUMMARY - From Initial Application
Genes play two different roles in biology, giving shape to phenotypes through developmental processes
within individuals, and transmitting traits across generations through Mendelian inheritance. Evolutionary
developmental geneticists work at the intersection of these roles, asking how the mechanisms that operate
within individuals influence the origin, maintenance, and fate of phenotypic variation in populations.
Pleiotropy, dominance, epistasis, polygeny, and linkage are some of the phenomena that unite developmental
and population genetics. One further class of phenomenon – early embryonic development – also bridges this
divide, involving molecular and cellular contributions from the embryo's own zygotic genome but also from
the substance of the egg, a product of its mother's genome. This dual regulation by two genomes creates
distinctive transmission genetics properties for early development, properties that alter predictions about
patterns of variation and divergence.
To better understand how maternal and zygotic genetic effects and their interactions shape variation and
evolution of development, this project sets as its goal the characterization of genetic architectures of
embryogenesis in multiple experimental model systems, each with unique complementary features.
One line of research focuses on Caenorhabditis nematodes, a longstanding experimental model for
developmental genetics. Building on the lab's extensive resources for quantitative genetic analysis in these
animals, the project will use controlled experimental crosses to reveal genetic variants that act either in the
mother's genome or in that of her offspring to influence developmental gene expression. The project will use
two experimental panels of C. elegans, one that maximizes detection power and one that maximizes mapping
resolution. To address questions about the role of mating system in maternal-zygotic coevolution, the project
will also use an experimental panel of C. becei, a closely related species that exhibits obligate outcrossing in
contrast to the self-fertilization that characterizes C. elegans.
A second line of research focuses on variation in embryonic development an annelid model system, Streblospio
benedicti. This species is unique in exhibiting both direct and indirect development as heritable variation, with
the alternative modes representing adaptive strategies to different environmental conditions. This system
provides a directional selection counterpart to the stabilizing selection that Caenorhabditis embryogenesis
experiences. Measurements of embryonic gene expression in a large S. benedicti pedigree will facilitate genetic
dissection of both maternal and zygotic contributions to development and tests of the role of maternal-zygotic
genetic interactions in driving or preventing adaptive evolution."
11036442,"Summary/Abstract of Parent Award Project
In eukaryotic cells, gene expression is regulated at multiple levels, including post-transcriptional
gene silencing, where microRNAs (miRNAs) bind to complementary target RNAs and cause
translational repression. Argonaute (AGO) proteins and miRNAs form RNA-induced silencing
complexes (RISCs), the core players in gene silencing. Humans have four AGO proteins, AGO1-4,
which share a high sequence identity, and the majority of miRNAs bound are common across all
AGOs. Therefore, it has been thought that the four AGOs work redundantly. Nevertheless, an
increasing number of studies have found that each AGO has its unique roles in various biological
processes and diseases in addition to gene silencing. Although the interaction of all four AGOs with
miRNAs has been well characterized, little is known about how each RISC recognizes its target
RNAs. Elucidation of this recognition will provide insight into the unique roles of each AGO.
Meanwhile, the characterization of RISC and target interactions will facilitate target prediction
accuracy by improving prediction algorithms, which will take into account not only the
complementarity between guide and target but also the type of AGO and target interaction. In this
proposed study, we will pursue the following specific aims. In Aim 1, we will use cryo-electron
microscopy and X-ray crystallography to determine the structures of all four homogenously purified
RISCs with the same guide and target RNAs, which will provide insight into the differences in target
recognition by the four AGOs. In Aim 2, to clarify these differences, we recently developed a novel
SHAPE-based technique that allows us to visualize the conformational dynamics of target RNA
bound to RISC. The method will enable us to characterize this interaction within the RISC binding
channel and its periphery at a single-nucleotide resolution and can be expanded to understand how
RISCs recognize guide-binding sites buried within highly structured target RNAs. In Aim 3, we will
first use mass spectrometry to identify the unique protein binding partners of each AGO and their
specific sites of interaction. Then, we will use tandem immunoprecipitation, followed by RNA
sequencing, to determine how the binding of these proteins influences the target specificity of each
AGO and directs their functionality toward alternative cellular events. The outcome of this study will
provide a solid foundation for fields beyond gene silencing and enable the development of new
strategies for higher accuracy guide-RNA drug design in therapeutic applications."

This application details career development and research plans that have been uniquely tailored to facilitate the
transition of the principal investigator, Dr. Cristina Santarossa, to an independent academic position. This
MOSAIC K99/R00 proposal seeks to finalize her training in microbiology, master a new technique (lipidomics),
pursue activities that will promote diversity in the biomedical sciences, and gain skills for her independent career.
 The K99 phase of this award (first two years) involves a strategic career development plan that will allow
Cristina to: gain essential training in microbiology and lipidomics; participate in outreach activities to promote
recruitment and retention of students from underrepresented backgrounds; and acquire important career skills
such as lab management, mentoring, grant writing, and science communication. The plan also includes clear
and actionable steps for identifying and successfully obtaining an independent tenure-track faculty position by
the end of the K99 phase. Cristina has assembled a top-tier team of multi-disciplinary mentors and collaborators
that will oversee and guide her training, research program, and transition to independence.
 The research plan proposed spans both the mentored (K99) and independent (R00) phases of the award.
It involves understanding the structure and function of the LetA lipid transport family, which is conserved across
Gram-negative bacteria and certain eukaryotes. The K99 research program aims to characterize the cellular
function of E. coli LetA. The R00 research program then aims to determine the structure and function of LetA
proteins that structurally diverged from E. coli LetA. Core research questions include: How can these structural
variants facilitate lipid transport? What substrates may they be transporting? What is their cellular role?
 To address these questions, Cristina has developed a comprehensive research plan combining bacterial
genetics, structural biology, biophysics, biochemistry, and cell biology. It involves biophysical and biochemical
characterization of an E. coli protein that is in the same cellular pathway as LetA; identifying the cellular
substrates of E. coli LetA and two structural variants from K. pneumoniae and P. falciparum; structural
determination of the LetA structural variants and cellular assays to probe their function. This research will provide
key insights into the physiological role of a new mechanism of lipid transport that is likely conserved.
 The proposed studies will largely take place at Johns Hopkins University, which is home to a vibrant and
collegial community of microbiologists, cell biologists, and biophysicists. This environment is ideal to facilitate
the successful completion of Cristina’s K99 research program and Cristina’s goal of transitioning to a successful
career in independent academic research."
11035052,"ABSTRACT
A patient's own T cells can be modified using gene therapy technology to express receptors, termed chimeric
antigen receptors or CARs, which allow these immune T cells to recognize proteins on the tumor cell surface,
and in turn allow these CAR modified T cells to recognize and kill the patient's own tumor cells. This approach
has been successful in some hematological malignancies, however, it has not been successful to date in solid
tumors including small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Two mechanisms by which SCLC may evade T cell-mediated
killing are loss of expression of antigens, and suppression of T cell function in the tumor microenvironment. In
this proposal, we will attempt to overcome these barriers by designing CAR T cells that target two SCLC antigens
simultaneously, and that produce multiple factors (“armors”) that enhance T cell activity in solid tumors. We
hypothesize that these dual-armored, dual targeted (DADT) CAR T cells will be more effective against SCLC
than previous T cell-mediated and immune therapies. We have previously shown that CAR T cells targeted to
either the antigen GD3 or to the antigen DLL3, both of which are expressed on the majority of small cell lung
cancers, are capable of killing SCLC cells in preclinical systems. Additionally, we have developed multiple
armored CAR T cells that secrete factors such as IL-18, or an antibody-derived single-chain variable fragment
(scFv) that blocks the immune checkpoint receptor PD-1, or an scFv blocking the phagocytosis-inhibitory signal
CD47 on tumor cells. All of these armors enhance CAR T cell activity in our in vivo model systems through
different mechanisms. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will generate CAR T cells targeting DLL3 and GD3
simultaneously, to overcome antigen heterogeneity and antigen loss in tumors as a means of escape from T
cell-mediated killing. Simultaneously, in Aim 2, we will test pairs of armors to identify the pair that is the most
effective at enhancing the activity of single antigen-targeted CAR T cells against SCLC in vivo in
immunocompetent systems. We then analyze the immune cells in the SCLC tumor microenvironment following
CAR T cell treatment to assess changes mediated by the armored CAR T cells. Ultimately, in Aim 3, we will
combine these approaches to generate CAR T cells that recognize GD3 and DLL3 and produce multiple armors.
These DADT CAR T cells for SCLC may be suitable for further preclinical testing in preparation for clinical trials
beyond the scope of this proposal, representing a novel therapeutic approach to SCLC. Given our robust track
record in CAR T cell clinical translation, we fully anticipate having new CAR T cells suitable for clinical trials at
the conclusion of funding. Additionally, these novel CAR T cells may be used as tools to explore the interactions
between T cells and the SCLC microenvironment. The analysis of changes in SCLC tumors induced by the
armored CAR T cells proposed here may reveal novel aspects of SCLC biology and illuminate mechanisms of
immune escape and treatment failure in SCLC."
11035824,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Sepsis is responsible for one out of every five deaths worldwide. It is therefore essential to better understand
better diagnose and treat sepsis. We propose to use deep RNA sequencing of the whole blood of sepsis
patients to better identify the pathogen causing the disease, triage the appropriate resources, predict
outcomes, and identify novel therapeutic targets. Utilizing novel methods of computational analysis of deep
RNA sequencing data we will assess microbial populations, RNA biology (specifically RNA splicing entropy
and RNA lariats) and identify novel treatment targets/identify patients likely to benefit. Some RNA sequencing
data that does not match the species it came from (human) is typically discarded. We will look at this typically
discarded data for microbial (bacteria and viruses) populations to improve diagnostic ability. To assess the host
response we will study RNA biology. RNA splicing is a basic molecular function that occurs in all cells directly
after RNA transcription, but before protein translation in which introns are removed and exons are joined
together. Over 90% of human genes with multiple exons have alternative splicing events. We hope to assess if
RNA splicing entropy could be a potential biomarker in sepsis. Introns are typically degraded rapidly after
removal during splicing, however, the presence of these lariats could signify RNA metabolism dysfunction and
we will correlate this to outcomes. RNA sequencing data will also allow for application of novel interventions,
such as PD-1 antibodies, to patients most likely to benefit; essentially applying precision medicine to a critically
ill patient. We will utilize whole blood from humans with sepsis and compare to control patients in the intensive
care unit without sepsis. Samples will be collected serially over the course of the stay in the intensive care unit.
We hypothesize that data from deep RNA sequencing obtained during sepsis can be quantified and improve
care. With this equipment supplement the data will be translated to a test that will improve care."

significant role in various psychophysiological functions such as mood stability, cognitive and motor
functions, pain tolerance, sleep patterns, appetite, and thermoregulation. Pre-clinical findings have
established the role of 5-HT7R in autism spectrum disorders, Fragile X syndrome (FXS), epilepsy,
sleep disorders, neuropathic pain and migraine. Meanwhile, several 5-HT7R agonists, have been
reported and their potential use in various CNS conditions are being investigated. However, the
beneficial effects of activation or blockade of the 5-HT7R is not often clearly established, primarily due
to the lack of selective 5-HT7R agents. Even more critical is the absence of biased ligands that could
clarify several controversial observations that relate to the 5-HT7R. Thus, our goal to design,
synthesize and pharmacologically evaluate new agents with biased signaling towards G-Protein or β-
arrestin signaling pathways hold great promise in understanding the 5-HT7R and its application to the
treatment of various CNS disorders. Three specific aims (SAs) are proposed. SA 1 will focus on
extending our studies on the lead agents for their drug-like properties including brain penetration,
pharmacokinetic, metabolic, and bioavailability assessments and cardiotoxicity predictions (HERG, 5-
HT2BR). Based on the metabolic evaluations of lead compound 55933, the synthesis and screening of
new compounds is proposed in SA 2. This specific aim will also focus on optimization and design of
new agents to address the metabolic stability issues such as aromatization and glucuronidation
observed in the preliminary studies. For this reason, aromatization susceptible tetrahydroisoquinoline
moiety will be replaced with isoindoline which could not undergo aromatization and the CH2OH
group will be replaced with substituents such as -F, -CONH2 to restrict glucuronidation. In addition,
exploring the electron donating/ withdrawing (σ values) and hydrophilic/hydrophobic (pi values)
space around the THI/isoindoline ring systems with bioisosteric substituents, will reveal any
improvements in their drug-like characteristics. Simultaneously, docking studies will be carried out
using homology models to identify interactions with the key amino acid residues involved in inducing
conformations associated with β-arrestin recruitment to the 5-HT7R. SA 3 will cover functional
selectivity studies of lead 5-HT7R ligands for their agonist/antagonist properties and G-Protein or β-
arrestin signaling bias followed by evaluation of their effect on sleep architecture and NREM/REM
sleep pattern under in vivo conditions. Finally, selected test compounds will be compared with
SB269970 (5-HT7R antagonist) and compound 1g, a 5-HT7R partial agonist (as a positive control) for
their effect on NREM/REM sleep pattern in a mouse model.
Progress Report Summary of Parent Award: The full progress report will be submitted and
only a brief summary is provided here. In year 2, our primary focus has remained on aims 1 and 2 and
involved obtaining selective and functionally biased analogs for evaluation at 5-HTRs. We have
designed, synthesized, separated enantiomers, determined the absolute configuration by x-ray
crystallography and evaluated another six analogs of lead compounds for binding affinity and
functional activity at 5-HT and other CNS receptors. In addition, we have synthesized and evaluated
over twenty analogs which have been characterized. A major finding is reported in a manuscript

Scientific Justification of Supplement Request
A Waters Alliance HPLC/PDA/fraction collector system is needed to supplement an 18.5 year old
analytical HPLC system that has lost almost all of it's capability, including having only one pumping
chamber left which reduces capability down to only isocratic methods, only manual collection is left,
and it has numerous maintenance problems occurring at this point in the instrument's life, causing a
work stoppage, and slowing down severely the progress of our students and research staff. The new
system will enhance the throughput of the identification, separation, and collection of enantiomers
from our chiral drug discovery novel compounds using analytical size HPLC columns. The isolated
enantiomers and other test compounds from this system will be used in studies of test compounds
and metabolites in the plasma, and brains of rodents from brain penetration and pharmacokinetic
studies, metabolic profiling, and bioavailability assessments in support of Specific Aim 1. It will also
be used to assess the purity and confirm the synthesis of new compounds in support of Specific Aim 2.
It is needed to complete specific aims (SA1-2) as previously stated in the funded grant. This will
provide an enhanced capability for our lab and ready access for our diverse graduate students and
researchers to use for their PhD projects and research in support of (SA1-2).
The entire purchase price of the selected HPLC/PDA/fraction collector system is $99,488.21. We find
this price to be reasonable, as shown by the 3 quotes below. Other quotes are $105,429.43 and
$123,571.35. All quotes contain academic discounts. This purchase is incurred specifically for the
current grant and therefore the cost is 100% allocable to this grant. This equipment is necessary and
central to the success of the project to assess the purity and confirm compound identification from the
synthesis of new test compounds (SA2). The equipment is also necessary to produce purified test
compounds for our pharmacokinetic and brain penetration studies for this project (SA1).
The current amount of unobligated grant funds is estimated to be zero dollars ($0) by the end of the
second cycle March 31st, 2024. The expenditure plans are to continue to partially support a research
associate on the grant and to purchase needed chemicals, support the binding and functional studies
of compounds obtained, and evaluate them in animals. There is thus, a clear and dire need for
additional funds to acquire this needed equipment to enable the delivery of the specific aims of this
research.
Future Maintenance of Equipment
For the first 3 years, the instrument is covered by a warranty or maintenance agreement and includes
a performance maintenance (PM) visit. Training will be provided, and the user will be able to fix most
problems after that. Subsequent grant submissions in out years will budget for maintenance of the
equipment. Training will be provided during installation. HPLC grade solvents and chemicals will be
purchased as needed using existing funds.

11035834,"ABSTRACT
 Skeletal muscle possesses a remarkable ability to repair and regenerate following moderately severe
injuries (e.g., tears, sprains, etc.). However, following a substantial loss of muscle tissue (>20%), termed as a
volumetric muscle loss (VML), the muscle tissue is unable to repair and regenerate itself. VML injuries show
persistent inflammation and fibrosis at the injury site. Currently, no definitive therapy for VML regenerates or
restores the extensive loss of muscle mass.
 Our previous work revealed a correlation between impaired regeneration and a dysregulated immune
response in VML. This proposal will integrate regenerative and immunomodulatory strategies to boost muscle
recovery post-VML. The proposed regenerative therapy is a biomimetic sponge-like scaffold composed of
extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. In a rodent model of VML, implantation of this scaffold significantly
enhanced muscle structure and function. This work will modify the scaffold design to achieve sustained release
of an FDA-approved immunosuppressant drug called FK-506 (Aim 1). Sustained release of FK-506 is expected
to modulate the intense and chronic inflammatory response to VML and improve regenerative outcomes.
 Our second approach for VML repair aims to engage and modulate helper T cells. The function of these
cells is primarily mediated through their secreted products. We will identify specific helper T cell subsets that
can promote muscle regeneration. Helper T cell-derived pro-regenerative secretory products will then be locally
delivered to the VML injury site using biomimetic sponges to drive muscle regeneration (Aim 2).
 This project will benefit from NanoSight Pro instrument for nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA;
Malvern Panalytical) for the advanced measurement of high-resolution size and concentration of nano- and
bioparticles. Acquiring NTA equipment for my lab can significantly improve lab productivity and experiment
efficiency, reduce scheduling conflicts, enhance data quality, and provide long-term cost savings. This
investment will lead to more productive and reliable research outcomes for my team."
11035835,"Abstract
Mutations in the CACNA1A gene, which encodes the pore-forming subunit of the P/Q type calcium
channel (Cav2.1), lead to neurological disorders including Episodic Ataxia type 2 (EA2) and Familial
Hemiplegic Migraine type 1 (FHM1). Patients have typically been classified as having one of these disorders or
the other, but symptoms are often overlapping and the distinction has been called into question. More recently,
CACNA1A patients presenting primarily with cognitive defects such as intellectual disability or developmental
delay have been described, suggesting that a more salient dichotomy may lie between mutations that lead to
severe motor deficits and those that are characterized primarily by cognitive dysfunction. Motor dysfunction
such as ataxia has been attributed to disruption of neuronal excitability and pacemaking function of cerebellar
Purkinje cells, where these channels are most highly expressed. In contrast, the underlying mechanisms
leading to cognitive dysfunction remain unknown. However, Cav2.1 channels are also expressed throughout
the nervous system at presynaptic terminals where they mediate synaptic vesicle release. The varying
functional consequences of different CACNA1A mutations underscore the importance of delineating the impact
of each CACNA1A mutation on channel expression and function to understand how each causes the
associated disease phenotypes. We hypothesize that mutations that effect primarily neuronal excitability result
in classical motor phenotypes, while those that effect synaptic properties may give rise to cognitive deficits. To
begin to address this, we propose to characterize an array of CACNA1A patient mutations resulting in either
primarily motor or primarily cognitive presentations. We have validated and now propose to combine two model
systems to characterize the effect of these mutations: a heterologous expression system (HEK293t cells) to
assess cell-surface expression and biophysical properties using molecular, imaging, and whole cell
electrophysiology techniques, as well as the nematode C. elegans to investigate in vivo presynaptic
localization and synaptic function. This work will lay the foundation for elucidating the mechanism by which
CACNA1A mutations affect neuronal function and lead to pleiotropic patient outcomes.
 In this diversity supplement we propose to build on the aims of the parent grant by assessing the effects of
these patient-derived mutations on auxiliary channel subunits at C. elegans synapses. Moreover, the goals of
the supplement are to train postbac research trainee Alexa Augustine in neuroscience, genetics, molecular
biology and imaging approaches, provide her with the opportunity to develop an understanding of the
academic research lab environment and expectations of a PhD or MD/PhD program, and provide her with
extensive career development opportunities including support in her PhD or MD/PhD program applications."
11035485,"ABSTRACT
Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading cause of death in patients with refractory
epilepsy. SUDEP is second only to stroke in years of potential life lost to neurological disease and is a
major public health problem. Several etiologies have been proposed for SUDEP including cardiac and
respiratory dysregulation. Another that is postulated is impaired arousal. Seizures impair arousal. Among
arousal stimuli, one that may be particularly relevant to SUDEP is CO2. CO2 rises following seizures and
is part of the seizure cessation mechanism. Seizures are frequently associated with ictal and post-ictal
central and obstructive apneas. Apnea further exacerbates the accumulation of CO2. Impairment of CO2-
arousal is proposed as an etiological factor in another sudden death entity, sudden infant death
syndrome, which has many parallels with SUDEP. We discovered that seizures impaired CO2-arousal in
seizure naïve mice and those that do not have a particularly profound death rate. Whether this is true in
mouse models with strong SUDEP phenotypes is unknown. Thus, our goal in this proposal is to determine
how seizures in different sleep states impair CO2-arousal in mouse models of temporal lobe epilepsy
(TLE) and the genetic epileptic encephalopathy, Dravet Syndrome (DS). In Aim 1 we will determine the
extent to which CO2-arousal is impaired in epilepsy models. We will focus on the pilocarpine-TLE model
as many patients that die of SUDEP have TLE, and the DS model, as patients with DS have a
disproportionately high SUDEP risk. We will also determine whether simply having epilepsy in these
models impairs CO2-arousal as a potential easily measurable biomarker for SUDEP risk. In Aim 2 we will
determine whether neuronal function, assessed via fiber photometry, of arousal system components in
the dorsal raphe nucleus and parabrachial nucleus, two important contributors to sleep-wake regulation
and key nodes in CO2-arousal, is impaired by seizures and epilepsy. In Aim 3 we will determine whether
optogenetically stimulating a DRN-PBN circuit in DS mice, using a novel mouse model, prior to seizures
prevents seizure-induced death lending direct insights into possible therapeutic measures. Since the
models employed have known death rates, we will be able to compare findings between mice that die
and those that survive making these studies more relevant to SUDEP. Combining these findings with our
previous work, we will have a powerful, rigorous, translatable approach to identify convergent and
divergent mechanisms across models for how impaired CO2-arousal in epilepsy contributes to SUDEP
risk. We expect to be able to leverage these mechanisms to identify at-risk individuals and reduce death
from this devastating disease."

1. Summary of parent project
[From original submission of R35 GM122471]
Mechanisms underlying the origin and maintenance of adult form, and naturally occurring variation in adult
form, remain poorly understood. This research program seeks to elucidate how gene activities are translated
through cellular behaviors into speciﬁc morphological outcomes at adult stages. Such information will con-
tribute to understanding patterning and morphogenetic mechanisms essential for postembryonic development,
with relevance to human genetic disease, birth defects, aging and regenerative medicine. For these efforts, the
work uses pigmentation of zebraﬁsh, its close relatives in the genus Danio, and more distantly related teleost
ﬁshes. Pigment cells in these animals and other vertebrates arise from embryonic neural crest cells that also
contribute to a wide variety of other tissues and organs, including most of the peripheral nervous system and
craniofacial skeleton. Defects in neural crest derived lineages generally, and pigment cells speciﬁcally, are as-
sociated with numerous hereditary pathologies as well as cancers, including melanoma. During normal devel-
opment, pigment cells that arise either directly from neural crest cells or indirectly through postembryonic stem
cell intermediates organize into highly stereotyped, largely two dimensional patterns in the transparent skin.
Cell behaviors during pattern formation are readily observed as phenotypes develop, and genetic mechanisms
are accessible through mutational analyses and other approaches, both in striped zebraﬁsh and in other
species having very different adult patterns. The work described here builds on prior effort in this program, and
takes an unusually integrative approach to understand pattern and pattern variation, combining manipulative
experiments, genetic analysis, high resolution imaging, cutting edge genomics, comparative biology and be-
havioral assays. Goals in the coming years are to elucidate: (i) mechanisms by which pigment cell progenitors
are speciﬁed for different pigment cell types during development, and how diversiﬁcation of cell types has been
achieved evolutionarily; (ii) genetic and cellular mechanisms underlying self-organizing interactions among
pigment cells that are essential for pattern formation, and how these interactions and permissive factors have
changed to generate alternative pattern states among species; (iii) the roles of positional information in the tis-
sue environment in setting the location of discrete pattern elements that are essential for establishing pattern,
and how such information contributes to qualitatively different types of pattern across species. These efforts
will provide novel insights into pattern development and cell type diversiﬁcation over both developmental and
evolutionary time. General principles uncovered will likely be applicable to a wide range of traits that depend to
varying degrees cell type diversiﬁcation, self-organizing cellular interactions, and positional information derived
from tissue environments."
11035875,"Project Summary
The long-term goal of our research project is to define mechanisms that govern the development and
maintenance of motor neurons, as well as the formation and maturation of the synaptic connection between
the motor neuron and the skeletal muscle - the neuromuscular junction (NMJ).
The mammalian NMJ is a classic model of cholinergic synapses; it contains all elements of cholinergic
synapses, including the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) and the ACh receptor (acetylcholine receptor,
AChR), as well as the enzymes responsible for biosynthesis and degradation of ACh, choline acetyltransferase
(ChAT) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE), respectively. We use the NMJ as a model for understanding
synapses as it can provide information pertinent to both peripheral and central synapses. Its relatively simple
structure and easy accessibility make it more amenable to investigation than those of the central nervous
system (CNS). Furthermore, the NMJ has a significant advantage over the CNS because genes can be
deleted separately in the pre verses post-synaptic compartment, thereby facilitating the study of compartment-
specific functions.
This project addresses a fundamental question in the interaction between the nerve and the muscle – how
does muscle signal to the nerve to promote motor neuron survival, and to regulate synapse formation and
maturation? Using targeted gene deletions in mice, we found that muscle activity, mediated through muscle
dihydropyridine receptors (DHPRs) and a newly identified protein, STAC3 (SH3 and cysteine-rich domain-
containing protein 3), plays a key role in regulating motor neurons and the NMJ. Like DHPR, STAC3 is
localized at the T-tubules and is required for excitation contraction coupling in skeletal muscles. Our
preliminary findings open a new avenue of investigation for identifying feedback mechanisms from the muscle
to the nerve, and will provide important insights supporting future development of therapeutic strategies to
prevent motor neuron loss and treat neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)."

 PARENT AWARD T32GM132006 (PI: Henry, Clarissa)
The current T32 award supports an innovative, evidence-based training program that includes a co-mentorship
framework and transdisciplinary research opportunities. Bioinformatics and biomedical data science are
fundamental to biomedical research and our transdisciplinary research training program. The proposed
supplement will facilitate bioinformatics and data science research training in our T32 program by creating
reusable training materials for analysis workflows using Cloud-based computing platforms. Cloud-based
computing and data storage resources provide opportunities to broaden the application of bioinformatics and
data science in biomedical research. Our faculty created one of 12 training modules that are featured in the
National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) Cloud Learning Modules. This module guides users
on the analysis of prokaryotic bulk RNA-Seq workflows and features four submodules. It was created in
collaboration with the Maine Institutional Development Award (IDeA) Networks of Biomedical Research
Excellence (INBRE) program. The module has been and is currently used in one of our graduate bioinformatics
courses for the T32 program. The module is also used in two undergraduate courses at the University of
Maine. Among the 12 NIGMS Cloud Learning Modules, it is the most highly used as measured by the number
of times the repository has been cloned from GitHub. Given the success of this training module, we propose to
create three new modules, and expand the scope of the current bulk RNA-Seq module. The new modules will
demonstrate workflows for: 1) analyzing the expression of mature microRNAs using small RNA-Seq data from
mouse, zebrafish and C. elegans; 2) analyzing single cell RNA-Seq data from mouse and zebrafish; and 3)
modeling transcription factor networks from RNA-Seq data from human and mouse. The current bulk RNA-Seq
module will be expanded to demonstrate the analysis of mouse, zebrafish and C. elegans data. These
resources will be utilized by our T32 trainees in courses that provide instruction for running sophisticated tools
with increasingly large data sets for a variety of analysis workflows. Importantly, the modules feature datasets
from the same model organisms used by our T32 trainees. These example datasets can be used as templates
for analyses of data from their thesis research projects. The proposed project will also broaden the scope of
the existing NIGMS Cloud Learning Modules and be made available to other T32, T34, INBRE, NARCH and
R25 trainees, and the broader scientific community."
11033367,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Proteostasis of thousands of proteins is critical for cell viability, regulated in part by the cell proteasome. This is
a large multi-subunit machine that degrades short-lived or abnormal proteins. Proteasome function is critical in
many diseases, e.g. abnormally high in Alzheimer’s Disease or low in some cancers. In eukaryotes, the transla-
tion of subunits is initiated by transcription factor Rpn4, the subunits then assemble into the Core Particle (CP)
with chaperones, and finally the CP binds to the Regulatory Particle (RP), which identifies targets for degradation.
The long-term goal in this application is to help understand the mechanism that regulate proteasome assembly
in eukaryotic systems using both mathematical modeling and experimental analyses. The overall objectives in
this application are to uncover the mechanisms that regulate (1) eukaryotic proteasome subunit gene expression,
(2) assembly dynamics of the CP with chaperones and the RP and (3) post-translational modifications of the
proteasome. The central hypothesis is that eukaryotic cells have evolved a set of mechanisms that dynamically
regulate proteasome concentration and function. The rationale for this project is that the determination of the
mechanisms that regulate proteasome dynamics is likely to offer a strong framework whereby new strategies for
human disease and conditions can be developed. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific
aims: (1) determine the impact of cell signaling on proteasome pre-assembly regulation, (2) evaluate eukaryotic
proteasome assembly, and (3) examine the influence of post-assembly proteasome phosphorylation. Under the
first aim, a dynamical systems model will be used to determine how Rpn4 feedback regulates proteasome sub-
unit gene expression. For the second aim, an experimental approaching using yeast as a model organism will
be used to investigate assembly efficiency of CP and chaperone binding. Additionally, a theoretical model of
eukaryotic proteasome assembly will also be used. In the third aim, phosphorylation rates of subunits will be
experimentally tested and a generalize Monod-Wyman-Changeux mathematical model of multisite phosphory-
lation will be used to analyze the conformational changes the CP attains. The research proposed in this
application is innovative, in the applicant’s opinion, because it focuses on eukaryotic proteasome assembly,
which has not been sufficiently characterized to date and incorporates both mathematical modeling and experi-
mental methods. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to provide strong scientific
justification for the continued development and future clinical applications of novel proteasome assembly inhibi-
tors. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential of offering new opportunities for the development of innovative
therapies to treat diseases such as Alzheimer’s and cancers. Moreover, this fellowship is sponsored by Drs. Eric
J. Deeds and Jeroen Roelofs leaders in their respective fields of computational biology and biochemistry. The
proposed training plan includes a strong research environment and mentoring team conducive for the applicant’s
growth into an independent researcher, while promoting diversity in biosciences."
11036854,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The remarkable functional versatility of the actin cytoskeleton stems from its ability to assemble into a variety
of diverse structures - branched networks, meshes, and bundles. This architectural complexity is orchestrated
by actin-binding proteins, whose activity is delicately regulated in response to internal and external signals. Our
long-term goal is to contribute to human health and well-being by advancing the understanding of the actin
cytoskeleton organization by actin-bundling proteins and their contribution to pathologies (e.g., congenital
diseases and metastatic cancers). Plastin/fimbrin family of cytoskeleton organizers are conserved proteins that
promote assembly of actin filaments into bundles involved in cell migration, adhesion, cytokinesis, and formation
of stereocilia and microvilli structures of the inner ear, intestinal and kidney epithelia. Of three human plastin
(PLS) isoforms, PLS1 deletion results in deafness, PLS2 contributes to pathologies of the immune system and
the development of aggressive metastatic cancers, while mutations in PLS3 lead to severe osteoporosis with
bone fragility and other connective tissue disorders. Despite the importance and a long-lasting interest of the
research community to these proteins, understanding of their interaction with actin and their regulation is
superficial, whereas published structural and biochemical data are incomplete, scattered, and sometimes
contradictory. The overall objective of the current proposal is to fill these major gaps by providing a thorough
characterization of the molecular and cellular mechanisms governing the function of plastins and to demonstrate
how this improved understanding can contribute to explaining the pathology of plastin-related diseases. We
propose that the unique domain organization of plastins enables several regulation modes interconnected via a
central allosteric mechanism that confers multifaceted contribution to various actin-governed cellular processes.
Biochemical characterization of plastin isoforms will reveal mechanisms of their regulation and function at the
molecular level (Aim 1a,b}; high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy (EM)/cryo-electron tomography (ET)
reconstruction will provide structural details of plastin interaction with actin (Aim 1c); structural analysis and
atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations will generate a model of the auto-inhibition allowing to predict
functional outcomes of congenital mutations (Aim 2); while Aim 3 will focus on understanding functional
significance and implications of the allosteric auto-inhibition of plastins and its role in cooperation with other actinbinding
proteins. These approaches, supported by single-molecule speckle (SiMS), total internal reflection
fluorescence {TIRF), and bulk epi-fluorescence microscopy, will unveil plastin dynamics, cooperation with protein
partners, and contribution to actin-dependent processes in living cells. The proposal will result in a breakthrough
in the understanding of the actin-dependent cellular events controlled by the plastin/fimbrin family of cytoskeleton
organizers, uncover molecular mechanisms behind plastin-linked congenital {deafness, osteoporosis, and
diaphragmatic hernia) and acquired (cancer) diseases, opening opportunities for their specific therapeutics."

11036445,"SUMMARY
The maternal to zygotic transition is a universal step in animal development characterized by the
clearance of the maternally provided mRNAs and the activation of the zygotic genome. These two
processes are intimately interconnected, as maternal factors drive the activation of the zygotic genes,
and zygotic products actively target maternal mRNAs for deadenylation, repression and clearance.
While recent studies have begun to identify individual factors that regulate mRNA stability and
activation of the zygotic genome, we lack major understanding of 1) the regulatory code (sequences,
structures and readers) that shapes genome activation and post-transcriptional regulation, 2) the
mechanisms that regulate genome activation and protein output, and 3) how different regulatory
mechanisms are integrated to instruct mRNA turnover, translation regulation and genome activation in
the embryo. The overarching project combines massive parallel reporter assays to determine the
regulatory activity of different sequences in the early embryo, protein interaction maps (at the level of
the DNA and RNA) to define the factors that mediate transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation,
and novel imaging approaches to determine how pioneer factors shape chromatin structure and, in
turn, genome activation. Together these experiments will define the mechanisms that trigger each of
these steps in vivo and the gene regulatory network that controls early vertebrate development.
This project is relevant for public health across different contexts. First, from the standpoint of human
disease and cancer, pathways that control mRNA stability play an important role in aberrant oncogene
activation in cancer and are relevant to changes in cell fate where the cells transition to a new program
and remove the previous one through post-transcriptional regulation. Second, from the standpoint of
reproductive health, infertility is estimated to affect 15% of reproductive aged women, and early
pregnancy loss occurs in 25% of all pregnancies and up to 70% of pregnancies after in vitro fertilization.
Understanding the mechanisms of zygotic genome activation and maternal mRNA decay can provide
fundamental insights into human infertility and the development of tools to evaluate early loss of
fertilized eggs.
The results from this project will help us understand how gene expression is regulated in the early
embryo to trigger the activation of different developmental pathways during embryogenesis, and more
generally, will have broad implications in the study of genome activation and changes in cell fate."
11037417,"Melanin is the key determinant of human pigmentation that has evolved under natural selection and has led to
diversification of human skin color. Importantly, the number of melanin-producing-melanocytes and their
anatomical location do not vary among humans, only varying melanogenesis determines the human
pigmentation diversity. Our long-term goal is to build a comprehensive understanding of the epigenetic and
transcriptional machinery that dictate precise human melanogenesis gene expression programs that governs
normal-range human pigmentation variation and disease susceptibility. The key insights about human
melanogenesis have come from mapping genes involved in hypo- and hyper pigmentation diseases, Genome-
wide Association Studies (GWAS) of normal-range skin and hair color variation in human populations and genetic
studies on mouse coat color. Nonetheless, current genetic knowledge can explain only a fraction of skin color
variation in humans suggesting that many loci controlling pigmentation remain unknown. By conducting a
genome-wide CRISPR screen, PI has uncovered novel candidate genes driving human pigmentation. Among
the novel pigmentation genes identified, we found that KLF transcription factors are differentially expressed in
light and dark colored human melanocytes and play an antagonistic role in melanogenesis in a gene dosage
dependent manner. We will investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms of these closely related factors
to understand their roles in human pigmentation variation. Consistent with other human phenotypes, we
hypothesize that most DNA variants driving normal-range human pigmentation and skin disease susceptibility
may lie in non-protein-coding regions of genome. We will map the cis-regulatory landscape of melanocytes from
diverse color humans by performing unbiased epigenomic profiling to uncover putative enhancers with divergent
gene regulatory activity. We will prioritize the candidate divergent enhancers for functional analysis by focusing
on loci that have either previously been associated with skin color GWAS studies or overlap with novel
melanogenesis genes identified by our genome-wide genetic screen. Through genetic perturbation studies we
will confirm whether cis-regulatory changes affect gene expression quantitatively. Building on PI’s postdoctoral
work, over the next five years, the lab will combine diverse approaches to understand the genotype-to-phenotype
connection in human skin pigmentation variation. These approaches include pluripotent stem cell differentiation
models that recapitulate human melanogenesis in vitro, genome-engineering, massively parallel reporter assays,
single-cell profiling methods, quantitative melanin measurements, and validation experiments in transgenic
mouse models. Through our studies on a highly quantifiable trait such as melanin, we will provide insights into
how genotypic variation encoded in genome give rise to differences in gene expression and leads to phenotypic
divergence within human species, which has implication for human development, health and disease."
11036710,"Project Summary
Improvements in the accuracy, length, throughput, and cost-effectiveness of sequencing
technologies has resulted in a proliferation of multiple high-quality genome assemblies within
many species. These pangenomes have garnered great interest from the research community
because they provide an unbiased representation of sequence preservation and variation within
a species that can not be matched by a single reference genome. The benefits of this
representation are many. For instance, in biomedicine pangenomes can better reveal the
genetic origins of certain diseases, help identify stable vaccine/drug targets, and can better
characterize the evolution of cancers and tissue-specific mutations. However, the software used
to analyze pangenomic data is still relatively new and changing rapidly, resulting in a knowledge
gap between what tools are available and what tools are actually being used for biomedical
research. To address this gap, we have developed a workshop for the New Mexico IDeA
Networks for Biomedical Research Excellence (NM-INBRE) that teaches graduate students and
researchers how to use graphical pangenomics tools for biomedical research. By instructing
students in state-of-the-art pangenomics techniques we are expanding research opportunities
for the students and increasing the number of competitive investigators in the scientific
workforce. Unfortunately, the workshop is not free and it is only taught once annually to a limited
number of students. Furthermore, the workshop uses a private server, requiring students to
install the software in a different computing environment after the workshop to perform their own
analyses. For these reasons, this project will adapt our NM-INBRE pangenomics workshop into
an open-source Cloud Lab Module. Through the module students will learn how to operate in a
preconfigured cloud environment in a cost-effective manner while becoming proficient in
graphical pangenome analysis. The module will be made freely available online via the NIGMS
Sandbox so anyone can work through the module themselves at their own pace. We will use the
module materials to enhance our existing workshop and the materials will be free to use by
anyone in their own curricula. Overall, the goal of the project is to adapt our existing NM-INBRE
pangenomics workshop into a broadly available Cloud Lab Module to further reduce the
pangenomics software knowledge gap while making access to this knowledge more equitable."

Adolescents with a chronic medical condition (A-CMC) are more likely to misuse and initiate alcohol and other
drugs (AOD) at younger ages compared to adolescents without CMCs. A-CMCs account for the majority of
pediatric inpatient hospitalizations as A-CMCs are often admitted for an acute inpatient stay following an
emergency department visit for an exacerbation of their disease. However, A-CMCs are not routinely screened
for alcohol use in pediatric inpatient settings. Thus, the pediatric inpatient setting provides clinicians a critical,
but missed, opportunity to universally screen for alcohol use among A-CMCs once medical concerns are
stabilized. The current study addresses this gap in the care cascade by examining the workflow processes in
an urban pediatric hospital’s inpatient units, adapting Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment
(SBIRT) to the population and setting, and identifying SBIRT implementation strategies to pilot in a single arm
hybrid type III effectiveness-implementation trial. This research is attained via three Specific Aims. In Aim 1, the
candidate will observe inpatient workflows and collaborate with a Partner Steering Committee (PSC)
composed of hospital staff (e.g., clinicians, administrators, information technology), A-CMCs, and parents to
adapt SBIRT delivery and intervention components for the inpatient setting and population. Aim 2 will involve
continued partnership with the PSC, to select, specify, and prioritize a set of SBIRT implementation strategies
ideally suited for the inpatient setting and population. Aim 3 will consist of a single arm pilot hybrid type III
effectiveness-implementation trial that simultaneously tests the set of implementation strategies selected in
Aim 2 (primary outcome) and the SBIRT intervention adapted in Aim 1 (secondary outcome). To conduct this
research, the candidate, Dr. Summersett Williams, requires training in three key areas: 1) expert knowledge
and application of intermediate and advanced IS methods, including implementation strategy selection and
evaluation of implementation outcomes; 2) application of human- and equity-centered design methods,
including intervention adaptation and usability testing; and 3) expert application of the learning health system
model to improve the health of A-CMCs who engage in risky drinking through enhanced healthcare system
performance. These training aims will be supported by Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago
and by the candidate’s mentorship team. The mentorship team will be led by Primary Mentor Dr. Sara Becker,
an expert in
implementing SBIRT targeting risky drinking in pediatric health settings. The proposal will also be
supported by Drs. Robert Garofalo, Lisa Kuhns, and Patricia Franklin, experts in intervention adaptation,
human- and equity-centered design methods, and the learning health system model, respectively. Taken
together, this research and career development plan will advance a significant public health issue by advancing
access to evidence-based alcohol health services for a vulnerable pediatric population while launching Dr.
Summersett William’s career as an independent implementation scientist."

The objective of the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI): Administrative Supplements for Equipment Purchases for
Select NIGMS-Funded Awards (NOT-GM-24-021)] is to provide funds “intended for the purchase of needed
equipment that will enhance user access to and/or the impact of the resource” for centers, resources and core
facilities. The mission of the Molecular Center of Health and Disease (MCHD)-COBRE (1P20GM144041) is to
employ innovative molecular and physiological approaches to study health, onset and progression of disease,
and interaction with pathogens, with the goal of understanding the breadth of information from the molecular
level to the whole organism. The MCHD provides investigators access to several cutting-edge biomedical
research tools through two central research cores: Core B: Omics and Gene-Editing Core and Core C: Research
Computing, Bioinformatics, and Biostatistics. The focus of these cores is to generate cutting-edge omics
datasets, along with high level molecular insight into RPL, PPL, and other investigator research projects
associated with the MCHD-COBRE. The MCHD-COBRE is not currently supporting instrumentation required for
physiological studies as most of our access to this type of instrumentation is provided through interactions with
other institutional supported cores and COBRE (as to not duplicate services). However, there is an immediate
need to replace an instrument that will have broad usage for the MCHD and other COBRE. Specifically, our IVIS
Imaging System, which was originally purchased in 2009 (only instrument at UMMC or State), has become
outdated and desperately in need of an update due to age, frequent breakdowns, and technical limitations. We
request funds to purchase AmiHTX High Efficiency In Vivo Imaging System instrument to allow for higher
resolution imaging, additional capabilities including x-ray imaging, enhanced wavelength detection, and data
analysis capabilities. This instrument will serve both current and future RPL and PPL, provide a vital resource to
the UMMC research community that will be highly leveraged for the stated goal of the MCHD, and serve a goal
of IDeA funding to build institutional infrastructure for a high impact resource."
11036507,"Our brain is composed of an immense diversity of neurons that are molecularly, morphologically, and
functionally distinct. Understanding how this immense diversity of neuron types is generated and organized to
allow us and other adult animals to carry out such a vast array of complex tasks and behaviors is of great
importance. By far, most of the neurons in our adult brains are generated during development, either directly or
indirectly from the cell divisions of a defined but, rather heterogeneous population of neural stem cells.
Molecular differences exist among neural stem cells based on their location and neural stem cell themselves
can change their intrinsic genetic programs over time. Research outlined in this proposal is geared towards
better understanding of how neural stem cell extrinsic factors integrate with neural stem cell intrinsic factors to
control numbers and types of neurons produced through time and space during development.
 In the Siegrist lab, we use the genetically tractable model organism, Drosophila melanogaster, to
uncover the genetic pathways and molecular mechanisms regulating neural stem cell proliferation decisions,
from quiescence to proliferation, and then termination once development is complete. Our research goals
include gaining a better understanding of how dietary nutrient availability affects neural stem cell proliferation
decisions. In Drosophila, different neural stem cells respond differently to dietary nutrient availability. Most
enter and exit quiescence in a dietary nutrient- and PI3-kinase-dependent manner, except for a small subset.
The neural stem cells that divide continuously independent of dietary nutrient availability are the neural stem
cells that generate neurons important for memory and learning. Through genetic and single cell sequencing
techniques, we are working to identify the intrinsic differences among these neural stem cell types that
distinguish nutrient-dependence versus nutrient-independence. We are also working on determining how
dietary nutrients consumed during development regulate neural stem cell temporal programs and thus types
and numbers of neurons produced. Neural stem cells in Drosophila sequentially express a series of
transcription factors over time that specify the neuron types produced at each cell division. Whether extrinsic
factors, such as nutrient availability affects neuroblast intrinsic temporal programs is currently unknown.
Finally, we are also working to map out the neural circuitry that regulates neural stem cell proliferation
decisions in response to dietary nutrient availability. Altogether, the research outlined here will advance our
understanding of neural stem cell proliferation control during development and how dietary nutrient availability
affects types and numbers of neurons produced. These insights should stimulate new discoveries in
translational stem cell research in the context of normal development and disease states."

The long-term goal of our research is to decipher the essential molecular mechanisms underlying successful cell
division. Errors in this process have been linked to developmental defects and diseases such as cancer. We
now know essentially every protein needed for cell division. However, analyzing the precise molecular
mechanisms needed for error-free division has continued to be very challenging for at least three reasons. First,
cell division in human cells is a highly dynamic process that can be completed in <1 hour, with key steps such
as chromosome-microtubule attachments and nuclear envelop reformation taking only a few minutes. Second,
the microtubule-based structures that dynamically self-assemble and function in dividing cells can be ~1000-
times larger than their nanometer-sized protein components. Third, this multi-step process depends on several
distinct protein-protein interactions that can be transient and mitosis-specific. To address these challenges and
fill gaps in our knowledge we have: (i) Discovered and characterized cell-permeable chemical inhibitors of key
mechanoenzymes (e.g. AAA, ATPases associated with diverse cell processes). These chemical probes can be
used to rapidly (typically, within minutes) inhibit or activate (through relief from inhibition) protein function in
dividing human cells. We combine these fast perturbations with state-of-the-art microscopy (e.g. lattice light-
sheet microscopy) and quantitative image analysis to dissect mechanisms underlying cell division dynamics in
human cells. To identify target-specific phenotypes we carry out parallel inhibitor dose-dependent analyses in
matched cell lines that are either inhibitor-sensitive or -resistant. (ii) Deciphered how micrometer-sized features
(e.g. microtubule length or overlap length) can effectively be measured by nanometer-sized proteins to generate
proportionate outputs (e.g. tags or force). For these studies we have generated a biochemical ‘toolbox’
comprised of recombinant forms of the augmin complex, isotypically-pure human tubulin, key microtubule-
associated motor and non-motor proteins and g-TuRC (g -tubulin ring complex), the major microtubule nucleator
in human cells. (iii) Developed and applied chemical proteomics approaches to ‘capture’ and profile direct,
transient and context-dependent protein-protein interactions in living cells. The research proposed benefits from
our expertise and will combine chemical, structural and cell biology approaches to answer long-standing
questions, including: (a) What are the functions of different AAA mechanoenzymes during cell division and how
are their activities regulated? (b) What is the structural basis of g-TuRC-dependent microtubule nucleation and
how does this complex contribute to centrosome-dependent and -independent microtubule formation during
mitosis? Our research should provide new insights into fundamental mechanisms, uncover general principles
that inform on other cellular processes (e.g. microtubule organization in neurons), and may provide starting
points for developing new therapeutics."

 The adaptation of abiotic transition metal catalysts for applications in biological systems has undergone
remarkable growth in recent years with examples ranging from artificial metalloenzymes to molecular
probes for detection of challenging analytes such as carbon monoxide. The PI has a standing interest in
discovery, development, and understanding of strategies for detecting challenging biologically relevant
molecules via the unique reactivity of transition metals. Most recently, the Michel group reported BODIPY
Ethylene Probes (BEPs) as the first profluorescent Activity Based Sensors (ABS) for the detection of
ethylene in biological systems. These ABS adapted well-known ruthenium olefin metathesis catalyst, which
are known to readily react with ethylene.
 While ethylene has long been known as an important plant hormone it has also been demonstrated to
be produced in mammals as a result of oxidative stress that is hallmark to numerous diseases. In particular
ethylene arises from the radical fragmentation of lipid peroxides and/or intermediates in their formation.
The formation of lipid peroxides is a result of reactive oxygen species, which are implicated as playing
stress or signaling roles in numerous diseases including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and
neurodegenerative diseases amongst others. While there are some sophisticated spectroscopic methods
for sensitively measuring the biomarker ethylene in exhaled breath, these approaches are necessarily
limited in spatial resolution and complexity of sample. Since reporting our initial ABS approach, our group
has conducted systematic ligand modulation studies to improve probe response time and sensitivity.
Through this work the limit-of-detection was improved nearly two orders of magnitude. Despite these
advancements, important questions remain for broad applications in the detection of endogenous ethylene
related to modifications that further improve sensitivity while retaining robust stability in biological systems.
 The next stage of developing this technology will build on mechanistic insight and recent advancements
in catalytic olefin metathesis. This will be accomplished through an interdisciplinary approach of synthesis,
analytical and photophysical characterization, and subcellular localization studies. It is anticipated that the
proposed research will result in highly sensitive ethylene ABS localized to subcellular locations where
ethylene is expected to be found in the highest concentrations. Further we expect to explore novel
strategies for ethylene detection beyond the dosimetric responses generally employed for ethylene and
other small molecule analytes. As has been the case over the past 10-15 years, we envision that there will
be continued growth of transition metal catalysts operating in cellular environments to perform critical
functions that would otherwise not be possible. The research and concepts of the proposed program will
continue to significantly contribute to this field."

protein complexes and protein mutants as a readout for protein ligand binding and protein integrity,
respectively. Importantly, this technology will also provide entirely new capabilities to the lab including analysis
of samples in the presence of detergents and organic solvents, assessing molecular mass determinations at a
wide range of sample concentrations, and carrying out protein aggregation studies. The instrument also has
flexible throughput (24 samples using capillary chips or 48 samples when individual capillaries are loaded).
The instruments combined technologies comprised of nanoDSF, Backreflection, DLS, and SLS allow the
determination of key parameters including melting point (Tm), onset of unfolding temperature (Ton), turbidity

11033877,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Over 700,000 individuals across the world die by suicide annually. Most individuals who complete suicide suffer
from psychiatric illness, of which major depressive disorder (MDD) is most common. Suicidal ideation (SI) is
more prevalent in individuals with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) compared to those who respond to
treatment. Given treatment limitations of SI in TRD, novel interventions paired with an improved understanding
of the neurobiology of SI are needed. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is efficacious for TRD.
Evidence suggests that bilateral rTMS (i.e., targeting both the right and left prefrontal cortex) may be more
efficacious for SI in TRD compared to unilateral rTMS, and bilateral brain disturbances are evident from
neuroimaging studies in individuals with SI. Recent advances in rTMS delivery have greatly decreased treatment
duration: accelerated intermittent theta burst stimulation (aiTBS) condenses 6-weeks of standard rTMS into 1-
week. In fact, a unilateral form of aiTBS, the Stanford Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy (SAINT)
System, was recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of TRD. Given the efficacy of bilateral rTMS for SI,
and recent advances in accelerated treatment paradigms, investigation of bilateral accelerated TBS (aTBS) for
the treatment of SI in TRD is warranted. Compelling evidence suggests that SI in TRD is related to aberrant
cortical inhibition bilaterally in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and that rTMS may modulate inhibitory
neurotransmission. Mechanistically, cortical inhibition is closely associated with γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)
signaling. Therefore, investigating cortical inhibition in the bilateral DLPFC in conjunction with bilateral aTBS
treatment may be key to understanding treatment response. We propose to use transcranial magnetic stimulation
combined with simultaneous electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) to investigate cortical inhibition as a biological
target of treatment in this study (Aim 1). A randomized double-blind clinical trial will be conducted to test the
hypothesis of superiority of bilateral aTBS to unilateral aiTBS on SI in TRD (Aim 2). Seventy-six participants will
be recruited over 5 years. The applicant serves as Medical Director of the Interventional Psychiatry Program at
UC San Diego Health, and he will facilitate appropriate recruitment of participants into this study. The career

Cerebral microvascular disease (CMD) causes white matter injury and is a major contributor of the vascular
contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID), including as the most common co-morbidity to
clinical Alzheimer’s Disease. Chronic vascular risk factors such as obesity accelerate the progression of CMD
by primarily damaging brain endothelial cells. Risk factor-induced changes in cerebral endothelial cells contribute
to an increased risk of dementia. The molecular changes in cerebral endothelial cells caused by chronic
cerebrovascular risk factors remain unknown yet are critical to designing therapies to prevent and repair ischemic
white matter lesions thereby lessening the burden of VCID. We propose that a central mechanism of CMD
progression is dysregulated signaling in brain endothelial cells damaged by chronic vascular risk factors. Using
endothelial cell-specific transcriptional profiling, we show that chronic endothelial injury resulting from obesity
results in abnormal vascular expression of an interleukin/chemokine signaling pathway. This molecular pathway
results in dysregulated vascular-oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) signaling. OPCs are a critical progenitor
cell population in brain white matter that respond to injury and are responsible for remyelination. Preliminary data
demonstrate that chronically injured endothelial cells up-regulate IL-17 receptor b (IL-17Rb) and its effector
chemokine CXCL5. Though many inflammatory pathways may play a role in brain ischemia, we show that this
is the major inflammatory pathway that is active in endothelial cells injured by this chronic vascular risk factor.
Critically, we further demonstrate that endothelial expression of CXCL5 results in the chemotaxis of OPCs to the
vasculature, limiting their ability to remyelinate after a focal white matter ischemic lesion. Using gain and loss of
function studies at the in vitro, in vivo, and functional levels after stroke, we will dissect the molecular pathways
involved in dysregulated vascular-OPC signaling and identify a role for chemokine signaling in regulating white
matter injury underlying VCID. Studies in Aim 1 will use an in vitro conditioned medium paradigm to identify the
precise signaling mechanisms in endothelial cells that promote CXCL5 expression while identifying the
necessary receptors on OPCs that regulate migration and differentiation. In Aim 2, we will broadly determine the
role of chemokine receptor activation on the ability of OPCs to differentiate and remyelinate after stroke using
CXCR2 knockout and small molecule antagonism. Finally, we will show in Aim 3 that blocking the expression of
CXCL5 in white matter endothelia can reduce cognitive and motor impairment associated with focal white matter
stroke by promoting remyelination within the peri-infarct tissue adjacent to stroke. Together, these studies
establish new molecular mechanisms for the vascular regulation of remyelination as critical to the pathogenesis
of CMD and establish a new therapeutic target for VCID."

Cells utilize an array of actin binding proteins with diverse and complementary properties to
assemble, maintain and disassemble a range of distinct F-actin networks to facilitate different
fundamental functions including motility, polarization and division. To serve its function, each of
these networks has a unique architecture defined by the number, lengths and connectivity of its
filaments, which is maintained by a continuous dynamical balance of actin filament assembly,
remodeling and disassembly. A fundamental challenge is to understand how functional network
architectures are formed and maintained by the continuous coupling of architecture and
assembly dynamics. Here we are focusing on the cell cortex, a dynamic network of actin
filaments, crosslinkers and myosin motors, lying just beneath the plasma membrane, that
undergoes rapid deformation and flow to drive cell movement, polarization, division and tissue
morphogenesis. How ensembles of actin regulatory factors work in concert to simultaneously
regulate actin filament network architecture assembly and dynamics at the cortex of living cells
is poorly understood. The one cell C. elegans embryo provides a uniquely powerful opportunity
to address these questions in a single large cell, that is directly accessible to high resolution
microscopy, with powerful genetics, transgenics, CRISPR and RNAi. The C. elegans cortex is
primarily composed of an F-actin network of linear filaments and small filament bundles that are
assembled by formin CYK-1-mediated polymerization of profilin-actin, and decorated by actin
filament crosslinkers plastin PLST-1, anillin ANI-1, and by mini-filaments of non-muscle myosin
II NMY-2. Conversely, cofilin UNC-60A and capping protein CAP-1/CAP-2 appear to be key
regulators of filament disassembly and filament length, respectively. We are addressing how the
C. elegans cortical F-actin network architecture is formed and maintained through the dynamic
integration of formin-dependent filament assembly, filament crosslinking, filament capping, and
cofilin-dependent filament disassembly, all while the network experiences continuous myosin-
driven deformation and flow. We are combining the complementary state-of-the-art in vivo
expertise (quantitative single molecule imaging and particle analysis) and in vitro expertise
(reconstitution and biophysical analysis) of the Ed Munro and David Kovar lab’s to address two
major questions concerning the architecture and dynamics of the C. elegans F-actin cortex.
First, we will characterize the fundamental dynamics, regulation and feedback control of formin-
mediated actin filament and bundle assembly (Aim 1). Second, we will investigate the
fundamental dynamics, regulation and feedback control of cofilin-mediated actin filament
disassembly of the formin actin filament networks (Aim 2)."
11033167,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Personalized medicine and genetic counseling frequently run up against the problem of hidden variability. Low-
penetrant phenotypes complicate predictions about the severity of genetic diseases, even within a single
family. Disconnect between genotype and phenotype has profound consequences for individuals and
populations. ‘Cryptic’ alleles can accumulate in a population, shifting the genetic landscape and, when
revealed, altering disease prevalence and evolutionary trajectory. Molecular systems can buffer the effects of
such variation, however, when these are de-stabilized, previously cryptic variants are exposed, producing
novel phenotypes. Hsp90, an essential chaperone that stabilizes kinases, chromatin remodelers, and signal
transducers, may act as a ‘capacitor,’ buffering genetic variation until it is released upon environmental insult.
Inhibition of Hsp90 reveals cryptic variants in yeast, plants, worms, flies, and fish. In Astyanax mexicanus, a
teleost species that evolved eyeless cave populations, Hsp90 inhibition expands variation in eye size,
suggesting that Hsp90 perturbation may have played a role in the evolution of eye loss in these fish. While
there is substantial support for Hsp90’s role in buffering genetic variation, the mechanism(s) by which buffering
occurs, its role in development, and its impact on morphological change across generations remains to be
elucidated. Understanding the limits of Hsp90 buffering has profound implications for research into the genetic
determinants of development and disease within individuals and across populations. My work aims to use eye
loss in cavefish as a natural model of Hsp90 capacitance, specifically testing the central hypothesis that the
chaperone acts on key factors in eye development pathways to suppress variation. By intersecting
Astyanax genomics, Hsp90-client interactions, and genetic tools in zebrafish, this proposal will identify the
genes that contribute to Astyanax eye loss, examine the role of Hsp90 in development, and determine the
capacity of Hsp90 to contribute to evolutionary leaps. During the K99 phase, I will use gene knock-outs in
zebrafish to identify Hsp90-dependent genes that contribute to eye loss in Astyanax, uncovering novel roles for
Hsp90 clients in eye development. During the R00 phase, I will investigate the role of Hsp90 in development,
abrogating its activity in the developing zebrafish to identify tissues and pathways that are sensitive to Hsp90-
buffering. I will also assess the contribution of Hsp90 to eye evolution in the lab. Completion of these aims will
expand our understanding of genetic determinants of eye development, identify Hsp90-sensitive tissues and
pathways that may be susceptible to low-penetrance disorders or evolutionary leaps, and more broadly
determine the contribution of Hsp90 to observed ‘hidden variability.’ During the K99 phase, under Drs. Cliff
Tabin and Matthew Harris, I will obtain essential training in Genetics and Development and receive guidance
on best practices for rigorous experimental design. The proposed research and training will provide a
foundation for the success of my independent academic laboratory."

Many regions of the brain including the cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia, and limbic structures are
highly enriched with synaptic zinc. Synaptic zinc (as Zn2+) is loaded into presynaptic vesicles by zinc
transporter 3 (ZnT3), where it is coreleased with glutamate during synaptic transmission. Since synaptic
zinc inhibits AMPA and NMDA receptors – which mediate the majority of excitatory glutamatergic
transmission in the brain – synaptic zinc can modulate excitatory synaptic signaling. ZnT3 KO mice (which
lack synaptic zinc) display a range of cognitive and sensory impairments and demonstrate behavioral
deficits associated with autism and schizophrenia. Mounting evidence from human populations shows
that mutations in certain zinc transporters are linked with major neurological disorders such as
schizophrenia. Together, these findings strongly suggest that synaptic zinc signaling is important for
neuronal processing. The goals of this project are to understand how synaptic zinc contributes to normal
neuronal function and how disruptions in zinc signaling are linked to pathological neuronal conditions.
We will take three complimentary experimental approaches to these questions. 1) Using ex vivo brain
slice preparations and optogenetic stimulation paradigms, we dissect the roles of synaptic zinc in shaping
the dynamics of synaptic transmission at specific synaptic connections in cortical microcircuits. 2) Using
in vivo 2-photon calcium imaging, we assess the roles of synaptic zinc in shaping the sensory-evoked
responses of specific classes of auditory cortical neurons in awake mice. 3) Using in vitro high-throughput
screening assays and rational compound design approaches, we are designing novel tools to modulate
the function of specific zinc transport proteins. Together these approaches will allow us to answer
fundamental questions concerning the role of synaptic zinc in brain function and provide new mechanistic
insights into endogenous mechanisms that shape synaptic and neural processing."

A conceptual and empirical revolution is occurring in our understanding of the eukaryotic heat-shock response.
Heat shock has long been conceived of as a proteotoxic stress, triggering formation of toxic aggregates of
denatured proteins, which must be cleaned up by induced heat shock proteins. Recent results from our group
and others have established a complementary paradigm: temperature acts as a physiological signal, triggering
the adaptive formation of biomolecular condensates with specific cellular functions, and the condensation
process is regulated by heat shock proteins. Crucially, in the proteotoxic model, aggregates are trash, but in the
adaptive condensation model, they are functional treasure. Using an integrated set of biochemical, cell biological,
and evolutionary approaches established over the past decade, we are pursuing three linked areas: 1) identifying
and dissecting the cellular functions of particular heat-shock and stress-induced condensates of protein and
mRNA; 2) studying the regulation of condensation and dispersal, focusing on the specificity of physiological
condensates and their remodeling and reversal by stress-induced molecular chaperones; and 3) probing the
sensation and transduction of temperature into adaptive responses in fungi which rely on warm-blooded hosts
for growth or dispersal, and in the temperature-dependent activation of cells in the vertebrate immune system
during fever. In addition to fundamental insights into the operation and organization of eukaryotic cells, these
studies promise to shed light on intracellular aggregation processes known to be dysregulated during
neurodegenerative disease, uncover new mechanisms for the control of fungi, and provide new molecular insight
into how fever promotes immune-cell activation."

NANOG Structure and Function in Stem Cell Pluripotency
 NANOG directs access to stem cell pluripotency. There are considerable gaps in our
molecular understanding of how NANOG coordinates this process. This is also compounded by
the fact that NANOG (in particular, human NANOG) has been a challenging system to work
with. The investigators have successfully applied innovative fluorescence techniques to
characterize NANOG’s key structure and functional properties. NANOG is an intrinsically
disordered protein (IDP), with a prion-like domain critical for NANOG self-assembly and for
establishing contacts in pluripotency specific regions. NANOG is a ‘molecular hub’, reported to
interact with >100 transcription factors (TFs) and other proteins to form cooperative hub
condensates and coordinate activation of pluripotency genes and repression of differentiation
genes. The investigators will investigate and deconvolute how NANOG dose-sensitivity play a
role in chromatin looping and recruitment of TFs, co-activators, and epigenetic regulators. They
will use an intensive holistic combination of standard and innovative structural, molecular,
genomic and cell biology approaches. The first aim will elucidate NANOG’s dose-sensitivity
mechanism in establishing pluripotency by assessing chromatin reorganization and recruitment
of cofactors using Hi-C 3.0 and single molecule fluorescence techniques. The second aim will
probe the molecular elements (i.e., OCT4-SOX2-NANOG triad cooperativity and KLF4
biomolecular condensation) involved in activating NANOG expression. In addition, the aim will
investigate the molecular basis for NANOG autorepression. The last aim will focus on inhibition
of NANOG stabilization and oligomerization with dominant negative NANOG-based peptides.
These studies will provide unprecedented insights into how NANOG orchestrates establishment
of stem cell pluripotency and reversal of developmental aging."

Although the integration of neurobiology into immunological research has just begun, it has already profoundly
improved our understanding of immunology. By using the Caenorhabditis elegans model system, we have
identified three specific neuro-immune regulatory circuits that are mediated by the G protein-coupled receptors
OCTR-1, NPR-8, and NMUR-1, respectively. Our studies and others indicate that there could be a
predetermined setpoint for internal immunity, like the setpoint for the human heart rate, and that the nervous
system regulates immune responses to internal or external environmental changes and restores immune
homeostasis by bringing immunity back to the setpoint. Considering this “setpoint for immune homeostasis”
theory, we plan to investigate how the nervous system and immune system interact to achieve the resolution of
infection and the specificity of innate immunity, two important but poorly understood issues in immunology.
Previously, we have characterized the OCTR-1-dependent neuro-immune regulatory circuit in great detail and
have revealed that NMUR-1 mediates the specificity of C. elegans innate immunity. Here, we propose studies
to dissect the molecular and neuronal mechanisms underlying neural regulation of resolution in the context of
the OCTR-1 circuit and to identify specific neurons, neural networks, and neural signals that regulate NMUR-1-
mediated specificity of innate immunity. These studies will advance our understanding of how the nervous
system controls both infection resolution and innate immune specificity as well as define key regulatory
principles that govern neuro-immune relationships. Results from these studies could benefit the development
of new treatments for infectious diseases and innate immune disorders."

Eukaryotic RNA polymerase I (Pol I) transcribes ribosomal RNA, a key component of ribosomes. Pol I transcription
accounts for the majority of the total RNA in cells, and its upregulation in human cells is a hallmark of cancer while
its downregulation is a hallmark of several developmental disorders. Pol I transcription is understudied compared
to transcription by Pol II and even Pol Ill. Our preliminary work suggests fundamental differences between Pol I
and Pols II and 111 that are the basis for this proposal. Our broad long-term objectives are to determine the molecular
mechanism of Pol I transcription and how its dysregulation leads to cancer and developmental disorders. There
are major gaps in our understanding of (1} the structural organization and architecture of Pol I transcription
complexes; (2) the mechanism for how Pol I initiation factors interact with rDNA, which encodes ribosomal RNA;
and (3) the molecular function of several key Pol I transcription factors in the activation process. The first rationale
for this work is that determining the mechanism and regulation of Pol I transcription will form the molecular basis
for understanding how Pol I defects lead to human disease. Our central hypothesis is that Pol I factors use a
unique mechanism to carry out transcription and their structure and function is different from the mechanisms
governing Pol II and Ill transcription. The second rationale is that understanding the Pol I transcription mechanism
at the most basic and fundamental levels will translate to a better understanding of the connection between Pol I
and cancer, leading to new cancer therapeutic strategies. Our proposed research will use a conceptually and
technically innovative cross-organismal and interdisciplinary approach that employs a combination of bioinformatic,
computational, molecular, biochemical, genetic, genomic, proteomic, and structural methods in the yeast and
human cells. Guided by strong preliminary studies, we will test two specific aims: (1) Determine the unique
""coactivator"" role of TAT A-binding protein (TSP) in Pol I transcription, and (2) Determine the mechanism of Pol I
transcription activation. To accomplish these aims, we will use well-established and complementary approaches
to identify and map novel Pol I interactions in their native context. We will complement these studies with structural
modeling in combination with molecular, genetic, and biochemical functional assays to identify Pol I factor functions
conserved from yeast to humans. The proposed research is significant because it will lead to a detailed description
of the Pol I transcription mechanism and will provide a conceptual framework for understanding the link between
Pol I and human disease. Ultimately, this work will illuminate new avenues for diagnosis, potential interventions,
and the development of therapies targeting these novel protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions."

CAG repeat expansion diseases are the most common class of microsatellite expansion disorders. While
canonical translation of the CAG repeat leads to the production of polyglutamine proteins, these expansions can
also undergo non-canonical repeat associated non-AUG (RAN) translation. In the later process, translation is
initiated across multiple reading frames in the absence of AUG- or AUG-like start codons. While a few factors
that influence either canonical translation across microsatellite expansions or RAN translation have been
identified, our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for translation in multiple
reading frames is extremely limited. Despite evidence that RNA structure plays a key role in RAN translation our
knowledge of the structural features that facilitate RAN translation is extremely limited. To examine the role of
RNA structure in non-canonical translation, I used a structure-forward approach to screen for multi-frame
translation, through which I identified several long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that support translation in
multiple reading frames in the absence of both microsatellite repeat expansions and AUG-start codons. This
data suggests multiple avenues for RNA transcripts to support multi-frame translation, which has important
implications in biology, disease, and therapeutics. The overarching goal of this proposal is to determine the RNA
structures, protein networks and therapeutically relevant modifiers that govern various forms of multi-frame
translation (MFT). To determine the proportion of the human genome capable of undergoing MFT, I will utilize a
novel MFT reporter system to perform a genome-wide screen. Utilising candidate MFT sequences and CAG
repeat expansions along with my already identified MFT lncRNAs, I will determine the cellular RNA structures
and protein factors that facilitate non-canonical multi-frame translation. I will also employ a first-of-its-kind
strategy to identify novel, therapeutically relevant modifiers of co-occurring canonical and non-canonical
translation in multiple reading frames. These studies will enable a better understanding of the mechanism of
multi-frame translation and identify therapeutic strategies that have the potential to provide therapeutic efficacy
across multiple CAG repeat expansion diseases and be applicable to a wider range of neurological diseases.
Together this research provides an innovative approach to understand a novel paradigm for translation diversity
and will enable a better understanding of disease pathogenesis in repeat expansion diseases as well as
elucidating the aspects of MFT most suitable to therapeutic intervention."

Cell plasticity is the ability of cells to change their phenotypes without genetic mutations in response to
environmental cues. This cellular behavior is crucial for the development and progress of complex diseases,
such as immune responses and cancer. Changes in cellular transcription programs have long been considered
a major factor in defining the fate of cells during cell-type switching. However, the role that post-transcriptional
mechanisms can play in regulating cell fate, specifically in response to rapid changes in the environmental cues,
is a black box. A long-term goal of my laboratory is to identify the post-transcriptional mechanisms that regulate
protein synthesis and understand their contribution to cellular plasticity. Here, we focus on two areas of post-
transcriptional gene regulation: mRNA modifications and translational control. While there has been impressive
progress towards understanding the role of RNA modifications and translational regulation in controlling cellular
homeostasis, there is a significant gap in our knowledge of how these processes can rapidly affect cellular
plasticity in response to the changes in environmental cues. The eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3) has emerged
as a master player in translation regulation by promoting or suppressing the translation of a subset of mRNAs.
However, how this key initiation factor controls cell plasticity is a mystery. Our data indicate that eIF3 is critically
important for morphological transition in the yeast Candida albicans. In Theme 1, we will address the role of eIF3
in controlling cell plasticity in C. albicans by answering two key questions: 1) What are the composition and the
interactome of eIF3 in different cell types of C. albicans? and 2) What is the role of C. albicans eIF3 in regulating
mRNA translation during the yeast-to-hyphae transition? Our second area of research (Theme 2) is focused on
understanding how RNA modifications regulate cell plasticity in C. albicans. Our work demonstrates that mRNAs
are differentially methylated in different cell types in C. albicans, and inhibiting the mRNA methylation impairs
cell plasticity in this organism. By combining novel genetic tools and reagents that we have recently developed
with biochemical assays, proteomics, and next-generation sequencing we will answer two key questions: 3)
What is the mechanism of m6A deposition in mRNA during cell-type switching in C. albicans? and 4) How do
m6A mRNA modifications contribute to cell-type switching in C. albicans? Our findings will provide significant
insights into the mechanisms of post-transcriptional control of cell plasticity at the mRNA or translation level and
will aid in understanding how dysregulation of these processes contributes to human disease."

Our project is an exploration into the fundamental understanding of how cells sense the stiffness of the
extracellular matrix (ECM), a key factor affecting cellular processes such as differentiation, proliferation, and
migration. The parent grant focuses on the molecular complexities of this sensing mechanism, with a particular
emphasis on the role of focal adhesions—a kind of cellular 'grip' that connects cells to the ECM. Within these
adhesions, the protein talin plays a crucial role, acting as a mechanical sensor that responds to the stiffness of
the surrounding tissue and, through a series of signaling events, influences the behavior of the cell. To support
the intricate research outlined in the parent grant, we are proposing to enhance our experimental capabilities
through the acquisition of advanced laser and LED-based fluorescence imaging equipment. This new setup
includes a state-of-the-art laser system with four independent solid-state lasers and a pE-800 solid-state LED-
based illuminator, both of which are critical for the high-resolution imaging needed to observe the dynamic
activities of cell-matrix adhesions. The laser system is equipped with fast-switching features and precise power
control, enabling us to observe rapid biological processes without the phototoxic effects that can alter or damage
the samples. This is particularly important for capturing live-cell images that are fundamental to our analysis.
The LED illuminator complements this by providing a less phototoxic method for FRET imaging, which is used
to study protein interactions in real time. With the new equipment, we will significantly improve our imaging
capabilities, achieving finer temporal resolution and reducing the phototoxicity that can impact the cells during
long imaging sessions. These improvements will facilitate a deeper understanding of the mechanosensitivity
signaling by focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in response to mechanical force, furthering our knowledge of how these
processes contribute to cellular responses to ECM stiffness. The delays in recruitment and equipment acquisition
have previously impacted our budget utilization, but with the recent onboarding of a new graduate student and
the involvement of an existing Ph.D. student, we are now poised to rapidly advance our research. The insights
gained from this study have the potential to inform new therapeutic strategies for diseases where tissue stiffness
is a key factor, such as in cancer metastasis and fibrotic diseases. This work, supported by the NIH, aligns with
the agency's mission to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability."
11033473,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Nager syndrome (OMIM#154400) is a rare craniofacial and limb disorder characterized by midface retrusion,
micrognathia, absent thumbs, and radial hypoplasia. This disorder results from mutations in the SF3B4
(splicing factor 3b, subunit 4) gene, which encodes SAP49, a protein that is a component of the spliceosome.
The spliceosome is a complex of RNA and proteins that function together to remove introns and join exons
from transcribed pre-mRNA. While the spliceosome is present and functions in all cells of the body, many
spliceosomopathies – including Nager syndrome – are often cell/tissue-specific in their pathology. In Nager
syndrome patients it is the neural crest (NC)-derived craniofacial skeletal structures that are affected. The
mechanisms underlying Nager syndrome pathology, as well as its tissue-specificity, are poorly understood.
Interestingly, other craniofacial spliceosomopathies, such as craniofacial microsomia (SF3B2), mandibulofacial
dysostosis Guion-Almeida type (EFTUD2), Burn-McKeown syndrome (TXNL4A), and Verheij syndrome
(PUF60) share similar clinical features with Nager syndrome, however it is unclear if they are caused by the
same underlying mechanisms. In this application, I will combine use of a Xenopus tropicalis sf3b4 mutant line
and Nager syndrome patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to tease apart the mechanisms
underlying Nager syndrome. This combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches will provide novel insights into
the mechanisms driving craniofacial defects in the context of Nager syndrome, which can then be translated to
other craniofacial spliceosomopathies to determine if they share a common root cause. The proposed
experiments will test the hypothesis that SF3B4 has NC-specific targets and/or binding partners, and upon
mutation these interactions are disrupted or lost, leading to abnormal NC development and subsequent Nager
syndrome-associated craniofacial defects. I have crafted three specific aims to test this possibility. Specific Aim
1: Using preliminary data from RNA-seq analyses performed on a Xenopus tropicalis sf3b4 mutant line, I
propose to identify the biological pathways disrupted in Nager syndrome by testing candidate genes via gain-
and loss-of-function experiments in Xenopus tropicalis. Specific Aim 2: In collaboration with the Columbia Stem
Cell Core, I propose to generate and characterize a Nager syndrome patient-derived iPSC line, and use this
line to characterize NC in the context of Nager syndrome. Specific Aim 3: In the R00 phase of the application, I
plan to use the knowledge and experience from modeling Nager syndrome and develop in vivo and in vitro
models of other craniofacial spliceosomopathies in order to determine their root cause. Altogether these
studies will provide novel insights into the mechanisms underlying Nager syndrome craniofacial defects, which
can be used to inform work on other craniofacial spliceosomopathies, establishing a unique view on
understanding craniofacial development and disorders."

The biomedical research landscape is shifting towards data-driven discovery, fueled by massive datasets and
powerful Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML) technologies. However, many researchers lack the
necessary skills to harness this potential. This project proposes a cloud-based NIGMS Sandbox learning module,
""Practical Data-Centric AI/ML for Biomedical Researchers,"" to bridge this gap and empower researchers with
the expertise needed to unlock the transformative power of AI/ML. The module is based on the summer 2022
training workshop sponsored by the Chemistry-Biology Interface T32 Program and Center for Bioinformatics and
Computational Biology at the University of Delaware with funding support from the National Institute for General
Medical Sciences (T32GM133395-03S1). The teaching materials of that workshop subsequently was
incorporated into the Introduction to Data Science course offered by the Bioinformatics Data Science program
at the University of Delaware. The proposed module will cover essential data-centric AI/ML topics like data
preparation, feature engineering, model building and interpretation, with hands-on exercises using real-world
datasets and popular tools like Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. The module will be delivered
using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for accessibility and efficient data analysis, removing technological barriers
and empowering researchers without significant institutional resources. The module emphasizes immediate
application of learned knowledge through capstone projects tackling real-world problems, and integrates FAIR
data principles and responsible AI development methods to ensure ethical and sustainable research practices.
The module will employ engaging videos, interactive demos, quiz-based knowledge assessments, and hands-
on project challenges to cater to various learning preferences. The proposed module will break down barriers to
cutting-edge technology and knowledge, fostering a more inclusive and collaborative research landscape,
regardless of researchers’ institutional resources. It will expand the skilled workforce by contributing to a future
where AI/ML expertise is readily available for driving biomedical advancements. The module will also improve
research quality by focusing on practical skills and FAIR principles to ensure responsible and reproducible
research. The proposed learning module will be disseminated via NIGMS Sandbox to have broad reach and
accessibility and will be integrated into the curriculum of the University of Delaware to enrich
undergraduate/graduate bioinformatics and data science education. In addition, the module can also be adapted
for tailored training workshops for researchers new to AI/ML, online MOOC for individual professional
development, and foster knowledge sharing and peer support for new researchers."
11036739,"Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) accounts for up to 17% of all epilepsy-related deaths, and
50% for those refractory to treatment. There is increasing evidence that apnea (respiratory arrest) is the
primary cause of death from SUDEP. We have shown in a number of mouse models - including PTZ injection,
rapid kindling (prelim. data), and mouse models harboring Scn8a mutations identified from SUDEP patients -
that sudden death is due to seizure-induced apnea (SIA) that occurs during tonic seizures, minutes prior
to terminal asystole. As it pertains to this proposal, we have also made four other important observations:
1) artificial ventilation can prevent death and suppressed cardiac activity does not increase likelihood of fatality;
2) tonic contraction of breathing muscles represents a likely mechanism of SIA; 3) inhibition of cortical seizure
activity does not impact SIA; and 4) inhibition of the inspiratory oscillator does not reduce apnea (prelim. data),
suggesting seizure spread bypasses homeostatic elements of respiratory control circuitry. CENTRAL
HYPOTHESIS: [AIM 1] Increased midbrain and pontine excitability is both necessary and sufficient to
produce SIA, [AIM 2] the parabrachial/kölliker fuse (PB/KF) nucleus in the pons represents a key nodal
point for SIA generation, and [AIM 3] that brainstem nuclei, like the PB/KF and PAG are recruited
specifically during SIA, which we will explore using electrophysiology and genetic mapping. AIM 1: We
have previously used chemogenetics to demonstrate that cortical ictal activity is not required for SIA and we now
propose that hyperexcitability of the pons and midbrain drive SIA and SUDEP. We will use chemogenetics to
inhibit different parts of the brainstem of Scn8a mutant mice to test their necessity for SIA and SUDEP.
Additionally, we will test sufficiency of these regions by selectively expressing an Scn8a mutation that increases
neuronal excitability. Using the rapid kindling model, we will also perform patch clamp recordings to test whether
increased neuronal excitability in these regions occurs concurrently with the development of SIA. AIM 2: The
parabrachial/kölliker fuse nucleus PB/KF in the Pons is a key nodal point for descending forebrain input and
projects past the inspiratory oscillator, and is modulated by the vagus nerve. In this aim, we will photoinhibit the
Foxp2-positive PB/KF neurons to regain normal breathing pattern during SIA, photostimulate P2ry1-positive
vagal afferent nerve fibers to interrupt inspiration during SIA, and determine if PB/KF and Npy2r-positive vagal
neuron photostimulation rescues postictal breathing in our PTZ SUDEP mouse model. AIM 3: We have
demonstrated that tonic seizures with SIA and clonic seizures without SIA can occur in the very same mouse,
both in Scn8a mutant and rapid kindling models (prelim. data) and that certain mid- and hindbrain structures are
activated during SIA. We will determine the neuronal circuitry activated specifically during SIA and SUDEP using
in vivo electrophysiology and TRAP2 identification of activated neurons."
11036965,"Project Summary/Abstract
The Y chromosome is widely believed to be the sole source of sex differences in mammals. Emerging work,
including from our group, however, also implicates X-linked genes in inducing sexually dimorphic gene
expression. Although most X-linked genes are expressed equally between females and males through the
transcriptional inactivation of one of the two X chromosomes in females, some escape X-inactivation and are
subject to higher expression in females. Differences in the levels of expression of X-linked genes between the
sexes may thus contribute to sex differences. The long-term goal of this proposal is to elucidate mechanisms
of sex-biased transcriptional regulation. In the prior round of funding, we found that the higher expression in
females of the X-inactivation escapee Kdm5c induces X-inactivation selectively in females and not males in an
evolutionarily conserved. We have also accumulated preliminary data suggesting that whereas at a higher
expression dose KDM5C induces X-inactivation, at a lower dose it paradoxically first prevents inactivation of
the active X chromosome in males as well as in females. We further found that KDM5C also regulates
autosomal genes in a sex-biased manner. The overall objective of this proposal, which constitute the next
steps toward attaining our long-term goal, is to determine mechanistically how KDM5C functions in a sex-
biased manner. Our central hypothesis is that KDM5C regulates gene expression in a sex-biased manner on
the X chromosomes as well as autosomes through dose-dependent and locus-specific H3K4me2/3
demethylation. The rationale for this proposal is that the mechanistic dissection of KDM5C function will inform
the hormone-independent regulation of sexually dimorphic gene expression. The proposal's central hypothesis
will be tested by the following two specific aims: 1) Determine how KDM5C orchestrates the selection of the
active and the inactive X chromosome in mouse embryos and stem cells; and, 2) Mechanistically dissect the
functions of KDM5C in hormone-independent regulation of sex-biased gene expression in mouse embryos and
differentiating embryonic stem cells. The Aims will be tested by ablating or tuning the expression of KDM5C
protein and connecting changes in histone H3K4me1/2/3 modifications and their downstream effectors to
changes in the expression of the KDM5C target loci genome-wide. The proposed research is innovative
because it promises a novel mechanism underlying mammalian sex differences, including in the divergent
transcriptional fates of the X chromosomes, using cutting-edge chromatin and single-cell transcriptional
profiling technologies. The significance of the proposal is that it will identify novel dose-dependent genetic and
epigenetic mechanisms that contribute to sex differences independently of hormones."

 This proposal is in response to the NOT-GM-24-021 for administrative supplement fund pertaining to the
parental R16 grant. We request to use the funds to purchase a benchtop cell sorter to enhance the
accomplishment of the parental grant, which focuses on mammary stem cell characterization in mice with in
utero exposure to alcohol. The long-term goal of the parental grant is to understand the mechanisms of in utero
exposure to alcohol in breast cancer etiology and develop preventative strategies. The objective of the project is
to investigate the mechanisms of in utero exposure to alcohol-induced mammary tumor development with a
focus on stem cell deregulation.
 Maternal alcohol use during pregnancy has a profound impact on fetal development and disease risk later in
life. Increasing evidence indicates that in utero exposure to certain environmental factors is associated with
amplified breast cancer risk. Previous studies also suggest a link between in utero exposure to alcohol (IUE
alcohol) and increased mammary tumors based on carcinogen-induced models. The underlying mechanisms,
however, remain unclear. We will study the effects of IUE alcohol on mammary tumor risk using the MMTV-
erbB2 transgenic mouse model. Our preliminary data demonstrated that IUE alcohol induces significant pro-
estrogenic changes in mammary development and increased tumor multiplicity in this model system. Microarray
analysis showed that IUE alcohol induces distinctive gene expression associated with receptor tyrosine kinase
signaling pathways in the premalignant mammary tissues. We also found that terminal end bud numbers and
estrogen receptor (ER) and erbB2 pathway signaling were modified in the mammary glands in response to IUE
alcohol. Upon examining the effects of IUE alcohol on mammary epithelial cell differentiation, we found that IUE
alcohol induced the expansion of the basal/myoepithelial and luminal subpopulations in pubertal mammary
glands. To advance our understanding of IUE alcohol-associated breast cancer risk, we propose to investigate
the mechanisms of IUE alcohol-induced deregulation of mammary stem cells (MaSCs)/tumor-initiating cells
(TICs) and crosstalk between ER and erbB2 pathways in mammary tumor development in MMTV-erbB2
transgenic mice. Supported by our preliminary studies, we hypothesize that IUE alcohol promotes mammary
tumor risk through the upregulation of ER-erbB2 crosstalk and the consequent deregulation of
MaSCs/progenitor cells, which leads to cancer stem cell/TIC expansion and tumor development. The specific
aims are: 1) To determine the effects of IUE alcohol on MaSC and TIC expansion and function in mammary
tissues and tumors from MMTV-erbB2 mice and 2) To investigate the role of IUE alcohol-induced ER and Sox2
upregulation in the deregulation of MaSCs and TICs in mammary tissues from erbB2 mice. With this clinically
relevant mouse model, significant health concern, and novel approaches, the results from this project are
expected to have a profound impact on breast cancer etiology and prevention."
11035829,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The main goal of this project is to determine how morphogens control organ growth. During development, each
body part grows to full size and differentiates complex cell patterns under the control of morphogens, secreted
signaling molecules that spread through developing tissues and organize gene expression, pattern and growth.
The major superfamilies of morphogens are conserved in all multicellular animals, from sponges to man.
Understanding how they work has enormous implications for human health, as genetic and environmental
perturbations of their activities and signal transduction pathways cause diverse developmental and physiological
disorders as well as a wide range of cancers. Research on morphogens is thus critical for developing diagnostic
and therapeutic tools to treat human disease, a central mission of the NIH. Our past studies, using Drosophila,
established that members of two superfamilies of secreted proteins, Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs) and
Wingless/Ints (Wnts) function as bona fide morphogens. Initially we focused on the logic and molecular
mechanisms by which these molecules control gene expression and patterning. Here we turn to the fundamental
and enduring mystery of how they control growth. In the proposed research, we will fill three key gaps in
understanding. First, we will consolidate and extend a new “feed-forward” model for growth based on our recent
discoveries unifying the roles of Decapentaplegic (Dpp, a BMP) and Wingless (Wg) in the developing Drosophila
wing, a classic paradigm for morphogen action. In this model, Wg and Dpp act together to induce and sustain
expression of the selector gene, vestigial (vg), which encodes a transcription factor that “selects” the wing state
and programs wing cells to grow in response to Wg and Dpp. We identified a single enhancer element in
the vg gene that integrates Dpp and Wg input, as well as a “recruitment” signal, the protocadherin Fat. We will
now combine genetic, transgenic and molecular approaches to determine how this integration occurs and to
identify downstream effectors that govern wing growth in response to Dpp and Wg. We will also test a key axiom
of the model—that Dpp and Wg are required continuously, at long-range, to sustain growth—and determine how
these molecules move through tissue. Second, we will apply the approaches and principles that have emerged
from our analysis of the fly wing to elucidate how Dpp and Wg control the growth of other organs. We will focus
on the fly leg in which Dpp and Wg as well as their downstream selector genes and signaling molecules are
deployed in a manner that is highly conserved throughout the animal kingdom, but distinct from the wing. Our
analysis will build on our preliminary evidence that leg growth is governed by the ranges of Dpp and Wg—as in
the wing—but by different regulatory circuits and logic. Third, we will determine the role of receptor dimerization
or higher order oligomerization in Wg reception by Frizzled (Fz) family GPCRs based on our discovery of
unexpected functional complementation between three of the four Drosophila Fz proteins. This analysis should
provide insight into how Wnts are transduced by the ten Fz proteins in humans."
11035830,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cell division is a conserved process by which replicated chromosomes are equally partitioned into two daughter
cells. Errors in this process often result in gains or losses of chromosomes, known as aneuploidy, which can
cause and promote tumors and developmental diseases. During mitotic progression, chromosomes dynamically
change their positions in a force-dependent manner via forces generated at kinetochores, macro-molecular
protein structures built on centromeric chromatin that serves as platforms for microtubule assembly. While
chromosome territories, regions preferentially occupied by specific chromosomes in interphase nuclei, have
been established and are known to be involved in gene regulation and genomic protection, the presence and
function of chromosome organization in mitosis have not been adequately explored. Our long-term goals are to
characterize “mitotic chromosome territories” in mammalian cells and to uncover the function behind
spatiotemporal regulation of both chromosome organization and kinetochore dynamics in ensuring faithful
chromosome segregation. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that there exist chromosome organizations
in mitosis as in interphase nuclei using a super-resolution microscopy method we recently developed, which will
allow us to identify full sets of individual chromosomes and determine their spatial organization in mammalian
cells. If there exist mitotic chromosome territories, we will explore how and when they are established and their
evolution throughout mitosis. We also hypothesize that major mitotic defects (unaligned chromosomes, lagging
chromosomes, and chromosome bridges) are associated with improper chromosome organization. We will
examine this hypothesis by identifying which chromosomes are involved in each defect with increased frequency
and determine their positionings. Mitotic cells have two major pathways for correcting mitotic errors, mediated
by Aurora A or Aurora B kinases. Both kinases are spatially regulated and phosphorylate a highly conserved
microtubule-binding kinetochore protein, Ndc80/Hec1, to destabilize improper microtubule bindings for
promotion of error correction and regulation of SAC (spindle assembly checkpoint) activity. Aurora A-mediated
error corrections require proximity of erroneous chromosomes to the spindle poles, where Aurora A is
concentrated. On the other hand, Aurora B-mediated error corrections depend on dynamic deformations of
kinetochores. These suggest that mitotic chromosome positioning, coupled with kinetochore dynamics,
orchestrate the cooperation between Aurora A and Aurora B-mediated error correction machineries. We will
dissect the contributions of chromosome positioning and kinetochore dynamics towards Aurora A and Aurora B
error corrections using force-calibrated microneedles and a semi-automated, quantitative microscopy analysis
software that we recently developed called the 3D speckle analyzer (3D-Speckler). Our proposed work will
provide new, mechanistic insights into mitotic chromosome organization and its contribution toward ensuring the
integrity of chromosome segregation, which will contribute towards developing better therapeutic and detection
strategies for cancer and developmental diseases for improved patient outcomes."

(1) We request supplement funds to support the mentorship of one post-baccalaurate trainee in research related
to the parent grant to enhance her preparedness for applications to a doctoral program. We also request
supplement funds to support a second pre-doctoral trainee who will bring strengths of micro-molding and iPSCs
differentiation to the in vitro work proposed in the parent grant. For both trainees, we have planned independent
research, scientific workshops, fellowship writing, scientific communication and national travel to make the most
of this 1-year supplement period. (2) We also request supplement funds to support the goals of a PI-organized,
multi-institution Rising BME Scholars Regional Conference (2022-2024). This conference is a partnership of 10
universities, mostly in the Midwest region, intended to retain Ph.D.-level research trainees in academic research
careers. We request funds to evaluate 3-year conference outcomes, including job placement, success with
fellowship and independent funding, experience with other scholars’ development workshops, and ratings of the
conference programming. Working with professionals of an evaluation center, the conference organizers plan to
publish results to illustrate a model of inter-institutional collaboration to support trainee success. We believe the
process and outcomes will be of broad interest to the biomedical research community, for the potential to
increase minoritized scientist representation in research. (3) Based on the premise that research mentors should
use their position to advance diversity in academia, we believe an effective mentor must be an effective
communicator. For this reason, funds are requested to bring a 2-day scientific communication workshop to
campus, to educate 32 faculty mentors and trainees in methods of scientific communication towards the goal of
strengthening their advocacy skills for research and for STEM. (4) Finally, supplemental funds are requested to
bring engineering undergraduates, post-baccalaureate trainees and junior PhDs to the Annual Biomedical
Research Conference for Minoritized Scientists (ABRCMS) in November 2024, and a separate cohort to the
Annual Conference of oSTEM in October 2024. Completion of this work will promote retention of emerging
scholars in research-focused careers, enhance the quality of faculty research mentorship, and provide critical
support to trainees on the parent grant."
11036181,"Project summary
During transcription, the nascent RNA can anneal with the template DNA strand behind the advancing RNA
polymerase and cause the formation of alternative DNA structures called R-loops. R-loop profiling studies have
revealed that these structures are prevalent in all genomes and form normally and dynamically. Under normal
conditions, R-loops serve important physiological roles. Yet, over the last decade, harmful R-loops that arise
when transcription is perturbed have been implicated as powerful triggers of genome instability from yeast to
humans. Harmful R-loops have also been linked to an increasing number of human disorders. What
distinguishes “good” R-loops from “harmful” R-loops remains mostly unknown. In this proposal, we aim to
dissect the mechanisms linking perturbed transcription, R-loop metabolism, and genome instability. This will be
accomplished by addressing three central questions. (1) What defines harmful R-loops? While harmful R-loops
have been proposed in many studies, they have never been directly defined at the genomic level. We will
leverage our unique expertise in R-loop profiling to characterize these proposed structures in the context of
well-defined human cellular models of RNA processing dysfunction. This work will define the diversity of
altered R-loop landscapes that result from defects in RNA splicing, termination, and export and will allow us to
identify how perturbed transcription results in altered R-loop distributions, boosting our knowledge of R-loop
biogenesis pathways. (2) Does genome instability result from harmful R-loops or from altered transcription
itself? While attention has been focused on harmful R-loops, the negative impacts of defective RNA processing
on transcription itself have seldom been considered. To disentangle possible R-loop effects from pure
transcriptional effects, we will carefully monitor transcriptional perturbations in cellular models of RNA
processing dysfunction. In addition, we will directly measure the accumulation of DNA damage markers in
relation to R-loops, allowing us to determine for the first time if altered R-loops are actually “harmful” or if they
simply reflect abnormal transcription. (3) What is the role of Ribonuclease H1 (RNase H1) in R-loop
metabolism? RNase H1 has a clear biochemical ability to resolve R-loops and its over-expression in cells
suppresses a variety of genome instability phenotypes attributed to harmful R-loops. Yet, little direct evidence
exists to show that cellular RNase H1 expression resolves nuclear R-loops. Furthermore, recent studies and
our preliminary data suggest that RNase H1 could instead work by mitigating the impact of altered transcription
itself. To address these two possibilities, we will develop cellular models of RNase H1 depletion and over-
expression in mammalian cells and conduct a broad characterization of the resulting genomic R-loop patterns
and transcriptional effects. Our work will resolve crucial knowledge gaps concerning the formation and roles of
putative harmful R-loops in genome instability in human cells. The function and targets of nuclear RNase H1
will also be clarified, possibly revealing this enzyme in a fundamentally new light. We expect that this work will
durably impact the field of genome maintenance and provide insights into a range of human disorders
characterized by genome instability and RNA processing dysfunction."

Necroptosis is a genetically encoded necrotic cell death that is overactivated in many pro-inflammatory human
diseases, including cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, liver injury, pancreatitis, neurodegenerative disorders,
and a diverse range of viral, bacterial, and fungal infections. The necroptosis signaling cascade is mediated by
the sequential activation of RIPK1 and RIPK3 kinases downstream of pro-inflammatory ligands such as TNF or
microbe-associated molecules. MLKL (Mixed Lineage Kinase Like protein) is a pseudokinase that tetramerizes
upon phosphorylation by RIPK3 to form water-permeable pores that drive cell membrane rupture. The parent
award has been given for investigating the molecular mechanisms of programmed necrosis execution, focusing
on the regulation of MLKL by upstream kinases and E3 ubiquitin ligases. Current methods for accurate real-time
quantification of cell death execution kinetics are labor-intensive, expensive, and low-throughput. The
differentiation between late apoptotic and necrotic cell death is challenging, complicating cell death data analysis
and interpretation. To this end, within the scope of the R35, we request the Incucyte® S3 live-cell imaging system
for real-time and reliable quantification of cell death kinetics. This system will enable us to perform label-free
quantification of cell death, using machine-learning algorithms of the system, thereby bypassing any need for
fluorescent probes, allowing us to perform cell death quantitation in a non-perturbing manner in experiments
where only one subtype of cell death is observed. Incucyte® S3 will also allow us to perform cell death kinetics
experiments over prolonged periods in real-time and differentiate between apoptosis and necroptosis. Moreover,
this system will allow us to develop a method for monitoring the activation kinetics of kinases that mediate
necroptosis using a fluorescent-protein-based reporter system to support our mechanistic studies within the
scope of the R35 project. In summary, this sophisticated platform for continuous real-time monitoring of cell
health and cell signaling will enable us with advanced, unique, and rigorous methodological capabilities for
studying the molecular mechanisms of programmed necrosis execution, as it will allow us to perform highly
efficient, quantitative, multiplexed, and cost-effective cell death quantification and kinase activity monitoring
experiments. Thus, this equipment will significantly boost our efforts in deciphering the mechanisms that govern
the execution of programmed necrosis and identifying novel druggable targets for therapeutic interventions
aimed at necroptosis blockade in human inflammatory diseases where it is overactivated."
11036190,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Northeast Ohio has one of the highest rates of oral diseases (caries, periodontitis) and poor dental attendance
among low-income older adults. Professional organizations and the IOM recommend integration of oral health
(OH) activities into primary care for adults in order to reduce medical costs. But, published literature indicates a
lack of outcomes data to assemble an effective medical-dental integration. Impeding integration are also factors
such as lack of an electronic health record (EHR) based oral health (OH) assessment and referral, and
inadequate OH education and training for medical providers. Our survey data indicate that the majority of
providers would like OH facts to be communicated at primary care visits (PCV) but lack education and resources.
There are misperceptions about oral diseases among older adults that prevent regular dental attendance. The
proposed multi-level interventions will address factors that impede OH integration, and subsequently improve
self-regulatory behaviors in adults. The interventions are: Practice (medical assistants, nurses): EHR systems
based changes to ask, advise, assess, connect (AAAC). Provider (physician/nurse practitioner): improve
knowledge and skills using Common-Sense Model of Self-Regulation (CSM) theory based education and skills
training to communicate OH facts and reinforce importance of dental visits. A cluster-randomized clinical trial is
proposed to test implementation (practice) and behavioral (provider) intervention to address self-regulation and
increase dental attendance among low-income adults aged ≥55 years. The primary aims are: 1) UG3, Conduct
qualitative work with stakeholders and practices; system-based changes in EHR; and pilot-test the interventions
in 2 practices. UH3, randomize 8 practices to two arms to investigate the efficacy of a EHR based strategy at
the practice level to ask [OH risk assessment], advise [going to dentist], assess [willingness for referral], connect
[eReferral and/or resources] together with provider CSM theory-based education and skills to communicate OH
facts versus provider alone (standard or usual oral health care) to increase dental attendance (primary outcome);
and improve OH quality of life, oral hygiene behavior, and biometric measures of health (secondary outcomes).
Secondary aims (UH3) are to explore: the delivery and documentation of AAAC implementation strategy; and to
investigate causal pathways that affect the outcomes. The sample includes 209 providers and medical staff, and
800 Medicaid-enrolled adults. Data analysis (UG3) will utilize a mixed method design for qualitative and
descriptive statistics for quantitative data. Data collection (UH3) will follow the RE-AIM framework: adults
(outcome data from Medicaid claims, questionnaires, EHR); provider, practice (questionnaires); provider,
practice (process measures: reach, fidelity, adoption, maintenance from audits). A generalized estimating
equations approach will be used to assess effects of multi-level interventions on dental attendance and other
outcomes, while accounting for clustering within practice. Mediation methods will determine if intervention effects
occur through hypothesized mediators. A sustainable OH care model is proposed for primary care clinicians."

11037312,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are important targets of hormones, neurotransmitters and approximately
one-third of FDA-approved drugs. These receptors signal by coupling to transducer proteins from four families
of heterotrimeric G proteins and a family of four arrestins. Recent structural and functional studies have defined
a conventional allosteric mechanism whereby ligand binding to receptors promotes activation of G proteins and
arrestins. However, there is extensive functional diversity across hundreds of GPCRs and sixteen G proteins,
and many examples of physiology and pharmacology do not conform to the conventional model. For example,
we have found significant variability in the mechanism whereby GPCRs select appropriate G proteins, and
some receptors that recognize unconventional G protein determinants for selectivity. We have also found some
receptors that paradoxically inhibit G protein signaling instead of the usual activation, a type of GPCR-G
protein coupling that is unproductive. Finally, we have found receptors that associate with G proteins prior to
ligand binding and on average release G proteins after activation, a type of inverse coupling that can explain
the unusal pharmacology of such receptors. A complete understanding of GPCR-mediated signaling will
require a better understanding of these unconventional GPCR-G protein coupling mechanisms. In addition, it
will be necessary to translate molecular studies carried out with overexpressed molecules in model cells to
endogenously-expressed GPCRs and G proteins in their native context, where expression levels, stoichiometry
and subcellular compartmentalization more closely match the in vivo situation. Accordingly, we will carry out
studies to map unconventional selectivity determinants, determine the prevalence and physiological
significance of unproductive and inverse GPCR-G protein coupling, and to better understand the
conformational dynamics of GPCRs in cell membranes, and how this conformational landscape changes as
receptors bind ligands and interact with transducer molecules.
This supplement request will support acquisition of a BMG Labtech Omega plate reader, which will be
essential for studying endogenously-expressed GPCRs, G proteins and effectors in their native context in real
time. This instrument is the only one available with the capacity to monitor bioluminescence resonance energy
transfer (BRET) with high temporal resolution."

The recent surge in genomic datasets can be attributed to advancements in genomic methodologies and the
availability of user-friendly kits, enabling genome-wide research across a diverse array of scientific disciplines.
These datasets harbor invaluable information, facilitating groundbreaking conclusions. Among these
methodologies, ChIP-seq to measure the chromatin occupancy of proteins has been a staple for many
researchers. CUT&RUN and CUT&Tag are two new methods measuring protein occupancy and require their
own bioinformatic considerations. These technologies have transformed our understanding of TF-mediated
gene regulation and the responsiveness of chromatin modifications. Despite the recognized value of these
data, the analysis often becomes a bottleneck due to the need for bioinformatic expertise and specific
computational resources. We will address these challenges and aid researchers in integrating chromatin
occupancy data with chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) and gene expression (RNA-seq) taught in other
NIH/NIGMS Sandbox modules. Therefore, we propose the development of cloud-based training focused on
Chromatin Occupancy by Next-Generation Sequencing, including ChIP-seq, CUT&RUN, and CUT&Tag. By
integrating these with other Sandbox modules (ATAC-seq and RNA-seq), users will learn how to perform basic
processing steps as well as critical downstream analyses. Our approach will use interactive lessons in Jupyter
notebooks that follow an example analysis of p63, H3K27ac in relation to the BAF complex. This module
targets a broad audience, including students, postdocs, INBRE scholars, and researchers with minimal or no
programming background. The project leaders, who are experienced in teaching and using these methods, are
uniquely qualified to develop this training module. Through this initiative, we aim to democratize access to
bioinformatics training, facilitating the analysis of chromatin occupancy genome-wide."

Intersectionally” (TASHI)
, based at the George Washington (GW) University, is a NIMH-supported T32
predoctoral training program (T32MH130247-02) that fosters the next generation of researchers prepared to
tackle social-structural and intersectional factors that drive HIV and related health inequities. TASHI is currently
structured as 2 years of tuition, stipend and travel support per trainee and has engaged its 4 trainees in
academic coursework, an intersectionality seminar, mentored research, and community engagement.
The Recognize Excellence in Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility (DEIA) Mentorship initiative
represents a unique opportunity to extend and sustain TASHI’s impact. The goal of the 1-year supplement is to
leverage our team’s NIH-supported T32 TASHI predoctoral training platform to provide additional in-
depth and tailored mentorship and support to strengthen community-driven health equity research
expertise among a group a cohort of diverse trainees from backgrounds under-represented in
scientific research. The 4 current TASHI trainees are in various stages of their academic program trajectories
(range 2-4 yrs/~5-yr programs). Providing a third year of funding to trainees during the supplement will allow
them to deepen the integration of community engaged research principles and processes in their dissertations
and build the necessary skills to become leading independent investigators in the health equity research field.
Obj. 1: Utilizing the District of Columbia Center for AIDS Research’s Guide for Academic-Community
Partnerships: “Advancing Equity and Fostering Change (AEFC)” as a model, trainees will receive mentorship
and support to integrate the values, principles and processes of the AEFC guide into their dissertations.
Obj. 2: Leveraging collaborations with existing NIH DEIA research training pipeline initiatives and DC CFAR
scientists and community partners, TASHI trainees will disseminate their community engaged health equity
research plans through scientific presentations and peer-reviewed publications with community co-authors.
 In Obj. 1, trainees will participate in: biweekly 1-1 tailored mentored meetings with TASHI MPIs Bowleg and
Kerrigan; monthly seminar sessions with TASHI faculty to learn about and consider how to integrate the central
value, principles and six step research process outlined in the AEFC guide into their dissertations. This will
occur though readings, presentations, discussion, and feedback from faculty mentors, community partners and
peers. In Obj. 2, trainees will receive mentorship, support and feedback to produce peer-reviewed publications,
along with community co-authors, from their dissertation work from Aim 1 activities, and develop a collective
publication documenting the use of the AEFC guide in dissertations. Additional dissemination will occur as
trainees share their work with NIH DEIA research pipeline cohorts, and the DC CFAR CPC and SBS Core.
The proposed activities will strengthen TASHI’s impact and offer a model for T32 health equity programs."

The instrument requested in this Administrative Supplement for Equipment Purchase is a Tecan Spark Cyto
400 multimode cell imaging plate reader, which will significantly enhance the research aims of the parent
grant award (1R15GM152964-01) and the research environment at the University of Missouri-St. Louis (UMSL).
The parent NIH R15 AREA for Undergraduate-Focused Institutions project is to probe direct interactions between
amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) and the proteins comprising the NLRP3 inflammasome. Ultimately, we will seek to
characterize how those interactions lead to inflammasome function. The multimode cell imaging plate reader
possesses substantial versatility and will be involved in all three specific aims of the parent grant serving as a
key workhorse for many assays and cell studies. The instrument will replace current plate readers that are each
over 20 years old and limited in their capabilities. The absorbance, fluorescence and luminescence capabilities
of the Spark Cyto 400 are broad and will have a major impact on the training and involvement of student
researchers at UMSL. The live cell imaging capability (brightfield, phase contrast and fluorescence),
environmental and mechanical control, quantitation ability, and automated programmable reads are all important
and highly desirable aspects that will improve the speed and quality of the R15 project findings."

 The 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in mammalian DNA is drawing significant attention in epigenetics
because of its indispensable roles in gene expression regulation. The loss of 5hmCs in various cancers
including glioblastomas and lymphomas has been linked to the poor survival rate as well as the resistance to
anti-cancer therapeutics. Although there is amassing evidence of 5hmCs as a novel epigenetic marker, there is
very little understanding on how 5hmCs are enriched at specific loci in the genome. In this project, we aim to
identify the factors controlling the DNA demethylation pathway, which result in the formation of locus-specific
5hmCs in human neurons. For this purpose, proteins controlling the activity of ten-eleven translocase (TET)
family enzymes in the DNA demethylation pathway will be identified. To examine the function of candidate
proteins, we will take advantage of human induced-neurons (hiNs) derived from human induced-pluripotent
stem cells (hiPSCs). In addition, we will elucidate the role and fate of 5hmCs formed during DNA damage
repair process using blue light-inducible CRISPR/Cas9 technique. This robust experimental platform will
enable the rapid production of isogenic and homogenous neurons and other cell types. With this cell-based
assay system, high-throughput assays can be developed that will advance biomedical researches and drug
discoveries. Finally, we expect the successful completion of this project will expand our understanding on DNA
demethylation and their roles in epigenetics, development, and various human diseases."

The proposed Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) will launch Dr. Mollie Ruben's
program of research as an independent scientist focusing on identifying and reducing race and gender
biases in pain care. This goal will be achieved through a 5-year parallel research and tailored training plan.
Training goals include building expertise in (1) racial disparities and intersectionality in healthcare; (2) clinical
pain research, translational studies, and implementation science; (3) multiple mediation and programming
in R; and (4) leadership and professional skills to execute team-based science. Training goals will be met
through a comprehensive training plan with Drs. Stein (expert in racial disparities), Batchelder (expert in
gender minorities/stigma), and Elwy (expert in clinical pain research/implementation science), along with
consultants with expertise in mediation (Nguyen), simulation research (Blum), medical education (Warrier,
Rougas), and implicit bias (Maddox); workshops; conferences; coursework; and experiential activities. Skills
gained through the training plan will be put into action through a complementary research plan aimed to
identify mechanisms underlying race and gender pain care disparities among medical students. The
management of pain is marked by inequities, particularly in the underestimation, inaccurate recognition, and
mistreatment of pain in women and people of color. Despite these challenges, there is a lack of research on
pain assessment biases, including race, gender, and transgender and gender-diverse (TGD) patients. This
proposal addresses these gaps by developing pain assessment methods inclusive of TGD people (N = 80)
and examining medical students' (N = 120) implicit and explicit biases in pain assessment and their impact
on pain care disparities during a standardized patient (SP) interaction. The proposed project has three
specific aims: (1) analyze new racially diverse TGD pain videos and test for differences in the experience of
pain; (2) establish the pattern of relationships between medical students' implicit and explicit race and
gender biases on perceptual biases in pain assessment; (3) determine the extent to which pain assessment
biases are a mechanism underlying disparities in pain treatment and care. Findings from the proposal will
provide preliminary data for a R01 application to be completed by Dr. Ruben during the award period. The
proposed research seeks to address knowledge gaps by identifying underlying mechanisms responsible for
intersectional race and gender disparities, with the goal to implement effective evidence-based provider-
level interventions to mitigate biases and promote more equitable pain care for systematically marginalized
patients. Thus, this proposal is in line with NIMHD Minority Health and Health Disparities Research
Framework and NIMHD's Strategic Plan to investigate patient–clinician communication affecting health
disparities emphasizing the sociocultural environment, healthcare system, and provider levels of influence.
Completion of the K01 will provide Dr. Ruben with the expertise to conduct innovative, high-impact research."
11033517,"Project Abstract
While obesity has been shown to increase mortality in sepsis, the mechanism underlying this phenomenon is
unclear. Dr. Jalilvand’s preliminary data demonstrates that obesity is associated with increased 90-day mortality
in surgical patients with sepsis. Further, we have shown that obese adipocytes produce distinct adipocyte-
derived extracellular vesicles (AdEVs) that activate neutrophils and induce disordered neutrophil swarming.
These AdEVs are enriched with miR-223, which interacts with PIK3C2A to downregulate the phosphoinositide-
3 kinase (PI3K) pathway, thus reudcing neutrophil migration and chemotaxis. The governing hypothesis for this
proposal is that AdEV-mediated delivery of miR-223 to peripheral neutrophils in obesity impairs neutrophil
swarming by modulating the PI3K pathway, thereby contributing to disrupted pathogen clearance in surgical
patients with sepsis. We will test this hypothesis with the following aims. AIM 1: Define the role of AdEV-mediated
delivery of miR-223 on PI3K activation and swarming in healthy neutrophils and the efficacy of targeting this
pathway to restore swarming in septic obese and lean patients in vitro. We will determine the in vitro differential
impact of modulating AdEV miR-223 content on neutrophil function and whether pharmacologic upregulation of
the PI3K pathway can restore swarming in neutrophils isolated from healthy and septic obese and lean
individuals. AIM 2: Establish the efficacy of inhibiting miR-223 mediated PI3K downregulation in neutrophils to
improve swarming and survival in obese mice with intra-abdominal sepsis. Using a murine model of diet-induced
obesity (DIO) and intra-abdominal sepsis (cecal ligation puncture, CLP), we will test whether systemic delivery
of AdEVs enriched with anti-miR-223 improves neutrophil function, bacterial clearance, and survival following
CLP in vivo. Lastly, using a conditional, neutrophil-specific knock out of PIK3C2A, we will establish whether
transient silencing of PIK3C2A mitigates miR-223-mediated downregulation of neutrophil PI3K activation and
swarming in DIO mice after CLP. While capitalizing on her PhD in adipose tissue inflammation and obesity, this
proposal represents a departure from both Dr. Jalilvand and her primary mentor’s, Dr. Hsueh, prior research
focus. A multidisciplinary approach has been crafted to study the proposed aims to develop Dr. Jalilvand’s
expertise in EV biology and cargo, live cell imaging to follow neutrophil behavior and quantitative function,
pharmacologic targeting, and murine models of sepsis. Completion of this proposal will provide crucial technique
expansion needed to establish a unique area of research distinct from Dr. Jalilvand’s PhD, accomplishing the
short-term goals of this career development plan. Paired with the institutional commitment to her success that
includes laboratory space, protected time, and laboratory funding, a well-established committee of mentors has
been selected to ensure that Dr. Jalilvand will achieve the long-term goal of becoming an independent surgeon
scientist evaluating the implications of obesity in surgical patients with sepsis. As such, this proposal will provide
Dr. Jalilvand with the requisite mentorship and resources to transition to independence."
11032610,"Chronic musculoskeletal pain (cMSP), including fibromyalgia, affects over 14% of the population, is a leading cause of disability worldwide, and is often refractory to available treatments. New, non-addictive treatment options are urgently needed to improve the management of cMSP and reduce reliance on opioids. Light therapy delivered to the retina promises to be a powerful, non-pharmacologic therapy to ameliorate cMSP. Evidence is mounting for the analgesic effect of light in common cMSP conditions (e.g., fibromyalgia, chronic low back pain). Despite the incredible promise, the neural mechanisms and properties of light that drive analgesia remain poorly understood. Elucidating these details of the underlying neural mechanisms will unlock the full potential of light therapy for treating cMSP. These details include discovering how activation of specific visual system circuitry modulates pain, including identifying the neurons in the retina involved and tracing out the distribution of their signals in the brain and their interactions with pain pathways. We hypothesize that light-driven analgesia operates through specific visual pathways originating at the level of color-sensitive ganglion cells in the retina. Color-sensitive ganglion cells receive excitatory and/or inhibitory input from short (S-), middle (M-), and long (L-) wavelength-sensitive cone photoreceptors (e.g. S vs L/M). Green light has been recently implicated as a color of light that drives analgesic pathways far greater than white light of equal brightness, a hallmark of a color-sensitive retinal mechanism. This proposal brings together an integrated team with demonstrated expertise in vision neuroscience, optoelectrical engineering, neuroimaging, and translational pain research to comprehensively evaluate the retinal, subcortical, and cortical color-opponent mechanisms involved in light-driven analgesia. The specific aims will be done in parallel using homologous model systems that translate to humans. In this proposal, we will (1) Identify color-sensitive retinal ganglion cells that mediate analgesia and characterize their light responses using extracellular and whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings in the primate and rat retina to determine the optimal stimulus paradigms (spatial/temporal frequency, wavelength) to drive analgesic circuits, (2) Evaluate the cortical and subcortical responses to retinal stimuli that drive these color-sensitive ganglion cells to elucidate the brain mechanisms of light-driven analgesia in humans with cMSP, and (3) Map the analgesic circuit that carries signals from color-sensitive ganglion cells to the rat central nervous system and behaviorally link circuits activated by colored-light to pain circuits by trapping circuits driven by color-sensitive ganglion cells in a validated rat model of cMSP. Together, these aims will provide critical mechanistic insights into the interplay between retinal and pain circuits that carry chromatic information and will allow future translation of these mechanistic findings into practical, non-opioid, non-addictive light treatments to manage cMSP."
11036628,"Project Summary:
 Arf and Rho small GTPases play critical roles in cellular functions. They cycle the active GTP- and inactive
GDP-bound forms. They possess their own unique redox-sensitive motifs. However, the redox regulations and
functions of their redox motifs are unknown. Without knowing them, the development of effective therapeutics
for diseases associated with them is impractical. The objective of the parental project is to understand the
redox-dependent regulations and functions of these proteins. The long-term objective of the parental project is
to develop therapeutic interventions for these diseases. This objective includes the identification of novel
redox-inert nucleotides that seem to target the redox-sensitive Arf and Rho proteins to block their redox
responses.
 To achieve these goals, the parental grant proposal proposed characterizations of the previously unknown
redox-sensitive motifs found in the Arf family of proteins. A multidisciplinary study that uses EPR and
fluorescent spectroscopic and mass spectrometric approaches, as well as mutagenesis-based redox
biochemistry with novel mechanism-based nucleotide analogs and cell biology methods, was proposed. While
the proposed spectroscopic approaches can identify the proposed key intermediates, including thiyl radicals,
the predicted resultant formation of the GDP adduct in Arf and Rho GTPases cannot be directly monitored.
Also, the method to monitor the formation and decay of the proposed Tyr radical in Rho GTPase was
unspecified in the parental grant proposal. Our preliminary studies indicate that the GDP adduct can be
detected using UV/Vis spectrophotometric analysis. The Rho Tyr radical can also be monitored by a UV/Vis
spectrophotometer. Therefore, we propose to add UV/Vis analysis to the parental grant proposal. Accordingly,
we request a fund to obtain a UV/Vis spectrophotometer that is capable of the detection of the GDP adduct and
the formation and decay of the Tyr radical.
 The additional characterizations obtained through mutagenesis-based redox biochemistry and cell biology,
as well as other spectroscopic methods, will identify the various unprecedented redox intermediates, allowing
one to characterize the regulatory features and redox response properties of the redox-sensitive motifs found in
Arf and Rho GTPases. Furthermore, the redox biochemical analysis of this multidisciplinary approach includes
the use of nucleotide analogs that are novel redox-inert nucleotides. The UV/Vis spectrophotometer can also
monitor changes in the state of novel redox-inert nucleotides in Arf and Rho GTPases. Thus, the use of the
UV/Vis spectrophotometer will not only allow an examination of the mechanisms underlying the actions of
these redox motifs in the small GTPases, but it will also provide light on a novel therapeutic approach wherein
diseases associated with the uncontrolled redox response of these motifs in the small GTPases are reduced or
eliminated through redox desensitization of these motifs."

11036902,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
 It is estimated that over 1.7 million hospital acquired infections per year in the U.S. result from microbial
biofilms. New approaches to specifically target and disrupt bacterial biofilms will thus have a significant impact
on human healthcare. Exopolysaccharides like poly-N-acetylglucosamine (PNAG) are critical biofilm
components that facilitate cell-cell interactions and serve as a protective barrier against the host’s immune
system and common antibiotic therapeutics used to treat bacterial infections. However, there is little is known
about the molecular interactions of PNAG with other biofilm EPS components. Blocking the interactions between
bacterial cells and PNAG or using glycosidase enzymes that break down PNAG and disrupt biofilms are attractive
approaches to treat biofilm infections.
 Overall, our goal is to characterize molecular interaction networks of exopolysaccharides like PNAG,
determine how they contribute to biofilm formation and dispersal, and develop novel strategies to treat biofilm
infections by blocking these interaction networks or by catalyzing the breakdown of critical biofilm EPS
components. To accomplish this overarching goal, we have identified two primary research areas for the next 5
years and plans for beyond. The first area seeks to develop tools for rapid identification of PNAG in bacterial
biofilms and develop a live cell proximity labeling platform for identification and subsequent characterization of
PNAG-binding proteins. These protein-carbohydrate binding interaction have the potential to be targets for new
anti-biofilm therapeutics. A second area will develop high-throughput approaches to identify and subsequently
engineer PNAG glycosidase enzymes through functional screening of environmental metagenomes and iterative
site saturation mutagenesis approaches. To enable these studies, we have developed new colorimetric and
fluorometric PNAG analogs that enable the high throughput identification of PNAG glycosidase activity. This
research will establish a platform in my laboratory to rapidly identify and develop novel biocatalysts for biofilm
dispersal activity. Overall, these research efforts will provide new unique insight into the role of PNAG in biofilm
formation and will provide tools that will impact the way that we approach treating biofilm infections."
11035336,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Adverse auditory environments in indoor spaces present constant challenges to children during everyday
learning and social interactions. Spatial hearing provides access to auditory cues that promote auditory and
speech perception in these difficult listening situations. However, auditory spatial cues are distorted in most
indoor spaces due to reverberation—the excessive sound energy reflected from room surfaces arriving at the
listener shortly after the initial sound directly from the source. The perceptual consequences of reverberation on
spatial hearing have not been characterized in children with normal hearing, leaving a critical gap in our
knowledge of benchmark abilities to assess hearing device fitting outcomes for children with hearing loss during
real-world listening.
In the proposed work, our goal is to reveal the developmental trajectories of functional spatial hearing abilities
under realistic reverberation between 6- to 18-year-old children. This age range reflects the protracted
development of perceptual abilities, which underlies a multitude of immaturities in children’s processing of
auditory information particularly in difficult listening situations. This work takes an innovative and unprecedented
approach to study the impact of reverberation in auditory virtual reality, in which realistic auditory environments
mimicking children’s learning environments are simulated to maximize ecological validity.
Across the specific aims, we examine three aspects of functional spatial hearing abilities under virtual
reverberant environments that vary in interaural coherence—a metric that describes reverberation severity. In
Aim 1, we will investigate developmental changes in apparent source width—a measure of perceived auditory
object size that is critical for auditory scene analysis. In Aim 2, we will investigate the development of minimum
audible angle, the smallest detectable angular separation between two sounds—a well-tested metric for auditory
spatial acuity. In Aim 3, we will investigate developmental changes in minimum angular separation—a novel
measure of spatial unmasking based on the smallest spatial separation required to receive a target speech
benefit in competing babbles. By correlating the three outcome measures from the independent aims, we will
assess the inter-relationships between auditory object perception, spatial acuity, and spatial unmasking in
reverberant environments among school-aged children.
Findings from the proposed work will (i) establish our understanding of typical developmental trajectories of

11035341,"Inflammatory liver diseases such as chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection can progress to liver fibrosis and
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Hepatic T cell immunity is closely linked to liver diseases since T cells are not
only essential for the clearance of hepatotropic viruses like HCV but may also cause liver injury and contribute
to disease progression. However, the specific role of functionally distinct CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets or
innate-like T cells, such as natural killer T (NKT) cells, in mediating an effective antiviral immune response or
regulating liver damage during inflammation are not well understood. Thus, gaining new insights into the
functional biology of hepatic T cell subsets is a prerequisite for the development of HCV vaccine strategies and
immunotherapeutic options for the treatment of progressive liver diseases.
Limited access to human liver tissue and the lack of immune-competent small animal models has impeded
studies of hepatic antiviral immune mechanisms. However, we have recently developed an immune-competent
mouse model of an HCV-related virus, Norway rat hepacivirus (NrHV), which shares significant virological and
immunological similarities with HCV infection in humans. This advance now allows for in-depth mechanistic
studies of anti-hepaciviral immunity in vivo.
Our initial analysis of hepatic lymphocyte subsets during acute, chronic and secondary NrHV infection revealed
a significant induction of a diverse antiviral type 1 T cell response and T cell dependent viral clearance. However,
we also made the unexpected observation that subsets of hepatic CD8+ T cells and NKT cells are polarized
towards type 2 immunity and may contribute to immune-regulation. In this proposal, we will build on these
preliminary data and elucidate the functional properties and potential crosstalk of distinct hepatic type 1 T cells
and type 2 cytokine secreting lymphocyte subsets during NrHV infection. Specifically, we will use high-
dimensional flow cytometry, in vivo functional approaches and/or transcriptome analysis to 1) define the
functional role of different virus-specific effector and memory CD8+ T cell subsets, 2) determine the kinetic and
impact of CD4+ T cells on the generation of virus-specific CD8+ T cells and protective immunity, 3) delineate the
function of type 2 CD8+ and NKT cell subsets and define their impact on liver damage, virus-specific T cells and
other hepatic immune cells during different stages of infection. Finally, we aim to translate our main findings from
the mouse model to human HCV patients.
Our data will provide novel biological insight into the role and interplay of distinct hepatic type 1 and type 2 T cell
and NKT cell subsets in mediating viral clearance, protective immunity, tissue pathology or repair during a
hepatotropic virus infection in vivo."

 The ""Educational Toolkit for Bioengineering Design, Entrepreneurship and Service Learning”
parent award has focused on enhancing the biomedical engineering education by implementing several
additional curricular components in team-based courses that include clinical needs finding,
entrepreneurial bioengineering, capstone senior design and biomedical innovations for global impact.
Through this supplement award, we propose additional work to enhance excellence in Diversity, Equity,
Inclusion and Accessibility (DEIA) Mentorship. Specifically, we will focus our efforts on promoting (a)
mentoring students from diverse backgrounds (b)enhancing DEIA within the biomedical engineering
curriculum and (c) leadership experiences for mentees and (d) community engagement to promote
biodesign and service learning.
 If the goals of the proposed DEIA activities are met, students will gain valuable understanding
about the role of a biomedical engineer in the world around them, possess an understanding about design
and commercialization in an engineering context, but are sensitive to aspects beyond science, such as
health disparities and ethical challenges. Furthermore, by emphasizing the community engagement
aspect in the different courses as part of the educational toolkit, we are encouraging the students to be
the best possible stewards of their education, in growing to serve the communities around them, and
inspiring the younger generation of engineers."

The COBRE in Acute Care Research & Rural Disparities at Maine Medical Center, led by Dr. Douglas Sawyer,
is focused on mentoring acute care researchers, enhancing research infrastructure, and making a positive
impact on communities statewide. In its current Phase I, the program supports four project leaders in critical
areas such as post-resuscitation care, prophylactic antibiotics, molecular signaling studies, and telemedicine
for newborns. A significant part of this initiative involves the Flow Cytometry Core Facility at MaineHealth
Institute for Research, which houses our MACSQuant Analyzer-10 cytometer. With the system reaching the
end of its service life and facing increased usage, there is a crucial need to upgrade to the next generation
MACSQuant Analyzer-16. This advanced instrument offers six additional fluorescent channels, facilitating
simultaneous analysis of more extensive marker panels, which is vital for our researchers studying
stem/progenitor cells and immune cells. The instrument's enhanced capabilities align with the goals of the
COBRE and MaineHealth Institute for Research, supporting ongoing projects and expanding research
possibilities, including those led by COBRE project leaders. After a substantial $88,192 discount due to the
trade-in of the existing MACSQuant Analyzer-10, the total requested funds amount to $151,328. The
institutional support provided, including salaries, supply costs, and future service contracts, underscores the
vital role of the Flow Cytometry Core Facility in the success of the overall program. This investment is justified
by the critical role the Flow Cytometry Core plays in numerous impactful research projects, and the new
MACSQuant Analyzer-16 is expected to elevate the capabilities of the core facility, contributing significantly to
advancing scientific discoveries and supporting the goals of the parent grant."
11037363,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Specific recognition of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) structures underlies key biological
processes from development to antiviral immune responses, and involves a host of dsRNA-
binding proteins. Biochemical and structural studies have delineated how these proteins interact
with model ligands, yet dsRNAs that they encounter in cells are far more complex. Moreover, little
is known about how cells regulate dsRNA recognition. The goal of my lab is to understand how
dsRNA-binding proteins interact with natural dsRNAs in cells, connecting biochemical models of
dsRNA recognition to cellular dsRNA recognition and regulation. In the next five years, we will
focus on dsRNA recognition in microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis and innate immune sensing.
During miRNA biogenesis, Microprocessor recognizes and cleaves hairpin-like structures from
long transcripts called primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs). My previous research built a unifying model
of human pri-miRNA and discovered that an optimal miRNA hairpin enhances the cleavage of a
suboptimal miRNA hairpin on the same transcript—known as cluster assistance. Because nearly
40% of human miRNAs reside in clusters, with many implicated in diseases and influenced by
cluster assistance, we propose to dissect this fundamental regulatory mechanism in miRNA
biogenesis using biochemical, single-molecule, and structural approaches. Recognition of dsRNA
by innate immune sensors such as RIG-I and MDA5 initiates antiviral responses. Recent studies
show that endogenous dsRNAs can also activate these sensors, sometimes resulting in
autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The recognition of self dsRNAs therefore needs to
be restricted by proteins that modify, degrade or shield endogenous dsRNAs. Building on our
expertise in dsRNA recognition and processing, we will 1) develop new biochemical methods to
identify dsRNA ligands of innate immune sensors, and 2) develop new genetic screen methods
to identify factors that restrict self dsRNA sensing in innate immunity. Together these studies will
provide crucial insights into how cellular dsRNAs are sensed and regulated, with therapeutic
implications for cancer, autoimmune and infectious diseases."

Photoredox reactions offer unique opportunities to develop synthetic routes for new drug
discoveries that are otherwise unattainable via C-C bond formation through sp3 C-H and C-X (X
= halogen) activations. However, current methodologies that employ metallic (such as ruthenium
and iridium) complexes or explicit organic photosensitizer (PS) entail two critical challenges
relevant to the implementation of atom-economic stereoselectivity (critical for biomedical activity)
and easy separability and recyclability (required for large-scale syntheses). Heterogeneous
photocatalysts with enzyme-like selectivity are required but remained elusive –mainly due to
diffusion-related challenges where, unlike thermally activated transformations, the reactants,
substrates, and chirality-inducing groups need to come close within a short (typically nano-to-
microsecond) timescale. We propose to address the incumbent challenges with porous crystalline
molecular frameworks as a photosensitizer to drive selective catalysis within their well-defined
pore cavities.
 The diffusion-related challenge and relevant photophysical requirements are addressed
within certain crystalline metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) where tens of photoactive linkers
serve as light-harvesting antennas. The photoexcited energy transfer (also treated as molecular
exciton migration), along the preferred direction of the molecular diffusion, can be tuned and
primed. Efficient preferential exciton mobility can leverage the need for PS diffusion required to
excite the substrates. Therefore, this AREA proposal will pioneer novel MOF compositions that:
(i) control optoelectronic properties as a function of framework structure critically required for
heterogeneous photoredox catalysis, (ii) elucidate the generality of the MOF photocatalytic
reaction and products accessibility, and (iii) unveil the critical microenvironment needed for
stereoselective transformations. Endowed with molecular-scale porosity and tunability, MOFs
provide scalable, well-defined, modular heterogeneous platforms for fundamental photochemical
developments. The methods, combining molecular assemblies to harvest light driving
photochemical transformations within its confined, yet selective porous cavity, will provide
transferrable and potentially transformative fundamental knowledge for developing recyclable
and selective heterogeneous photocatalysts for the discovery of life-saving drugs."

transdisciplinary teams to tackle these problems by virtue of the multidisciplinary expertise of its members and
its geographic location. The Louisville Regional Community, composed of Metropolitan Louisville and the
counties of western Kentucky, is a unique mix of urban and rural environments with industrial and agricultural
exposures that is a microcosm of the United States. The region is plagued by rates of chronic disease (e.g.
cardiovascular, diabetes, cancer, etc.), all with environmental etiologies, that are among the highest in the
nation. The CIEHS facilitates research and training focused on: (1) exposure to industrial chemicals present in
the urban and rural KY environments (metals, VOCs, PCBs, vinyl chloride, etc.), (2) lifestyle factors (diet,
alcohol, socioeconomic stressors, obesity, etc.), and the modifications to response by life stage, genetics and
gender in development of chronic adult diseases. CIEHS is organized into three multi-disciplinary research
interest groups (multi-organ toxicology, cancer, and neurodevelopmental toxicology). The Integrated Health
Science Facility Core promotes translation of basic science including assistance with both adult and pediatric
clinical trials. The Community Engagement Core promotes multi-directional communication between CIEHS
investigators and community groups with special focus on rural health care providers and youth groups. The
Pilot Project Program provides resources supporting new environmental health investigators, collaborations
between CIEHS members and established investigators bringing new skill sets to environmental health
problems, new avenues of environmental health research by CIEHS members, and community-engaged and
community-led research in collaboration with CIEHS members. A Career Development Program provides
mentorship and support to new junior, as well as mid-level, investigators. These activities are supported by two
facility cores (biostatistics and informatics, and integrated toxicomics and environmental measurements). The
CIEHS provides leadership in environmental health research, promotes investigation of the interactions of
chronic exposure to environmental toxicants and lifestyle factors in pathogenesis, and develops the next

11036737,"Project Abstract
The major goal of this research is to identify the genetic risk factors with functional significance
to dementia in the model organism Drosophila melanogaster. The key aspect of dementia is
age-dependent neurodegeneration that cripples executive functions (e.g. inhibitory control) and
memory. Most dementia studies have focused on memory loss, which is a prominent symptom
of AD - the most common dementia type. While animal models have provided important insights
into the mechanism for memory loss, their utility for dementia gene discovery is limited since the
study of memory loss is time-consuming and laborious. Executive deficits are major symptoms
in early stage AD and related dementias yet largely understudied. We overcome these
limitations by studying inhibitory control deficit as a dementia endophenotype for the discovery
of dementia genes, which is innovative. Our approach is to conduct an unbiased screen for the
genetic loci causing dysfunctional inhibitory control in an age-dependent manner, with or without
the non-genetic risk factors. In this proposal we will also test the hypothesis that the genetic and
non-genetic risk factor interaction has a greater effect on dementia than a genetic factor alone.
Drosophila is tractable for student research training and education as it is easy to handle, allows
to readily apply state-of-the-art tools and approaches, and is cost-and time-effective. There is
currently no other biological research on dementia at UTEP. Dementia prevalence is
disproportionately higher in Hispanics than white Americans thus this study will not only promote
research relevant to our students and community but also increase the representation of
Hispanics in neuroscience research that is disproportionately low at present."

11037562,"Given the growing burden of substance use and rapid shifts in how we study substance use (SU) and
substance use disorders (SUDs), there is a critical need for a well-trained and diverse workforce to conduct
impactful research on SU and the complexity of its consequences. Responding to this need, we propose renewal
of the Drug Dependence Epidemiology Training (DDET) program at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of
Health (JHBSPH). DDET has provided research training for >29 years and has produced many of the nation’s
leading SU researchers. We benefit from strong institutional support for training, comprehensive course
offerings in epidemiology and statistics, and research in SU at JHBSPH and across Johns Hopkins University.
 Recent accomplishments have been exceptional, indicating that DDET continues to make a tremendous
impact on the field. Among those who completed training in the current project period, all predoctorates
completed their doctoral degrees in 4 years; all trainees (both pre- and postdoctoral) continued in research
careers; and 8 (of 13) postdoctorates are in faculty positions.
 The DDET team includes two co-directors (Maher, Johnson), five associate directors (Sherman, Latkin,
Mojtabai, Linton, Thrul), and 33 additional faculty (9 core, 24 affiliate). The participating faculty have sub-
stantial research expertise in substance use and SUDs, and all will work together to implement the training plan
and provide trainees with opportunities to engage in supervised research.
 The DDET program has strong and stable leadership, highly-qualified faculty, clear and relevant program
goals, and an ongoing record of excellence. Our mission is to create the next generation of scientists who will
tackle the challenges of substance use, SUDs, and their related harms. Our 5-year goals are to train scholars
who will: [1] investigate the causes and consequences of substance use and SUDs; [2] respond to gaps in
treatment and services for SUDs; and [3] develop, implement, evaluate, and scale-up interventions to address
substance use, SUDs, and their related harms.
 DDET is designed to provide broad knowledge in the fundamentals of research in substance use
epidemiology, services, and prevention, as well as specialized training in one or more of the focal areas. With
this competing renewal, we propose to provide cross-disciplinary, specialized research training in drug use for 7
pre- and 7 post-doctoral scholars. We have identified 5 focal areas that will enhance the quality and relevance
of training, each is led by an associate director. Focal areas include: [1] harm reduction & overdose prevention;
[2] interventions for SUD & infectious disease; [3] SUD & psychiatric comorbidities; [4] structural
determinants & drug control; and [5] emerging trends & technologies. Cross-cutting training areas include
polysubstance use, health equity, and human dignity. Training activities include coursework, seminars and

The exploration and comprehension of phylogenetic trees have emerged as fundamental
aspects of contemporary biological research. Phylogenetic trees offer significant insights
into the evolutionary interrelationships among organisms. Furthermore, they play a crucial
role in elucidating the spread of diseases, including the origin and evolution of pathogens,
the temporal and spatial distribution of prevalence, and the prediction of pathogen
transmission patterns. Additionally, phylogenetic trees facilitate the investigation of the
functional genomics of diverse species, including the emergence of novel body plans or
metabolic pathways, molecular adaptation, the evolution of morphological characteristics,
and demographic shifts in species that have recently diverged. Advances in sequencing
technologies have greatly enhanced the analysis of phylogenetic trees, enabling the
examination of extensive datasets, such as entire genomes.
The utilization of phylogenetic analysis use cases offers significant value by providing
researchers with a deeper understanding of the evolutionary progression of species and
their relationships. While our phylogenetic analysis framework is designed to incorporate
a generalized workflow, our primary focus will be on developing specific use cases
tailored to meet the needs of our user base within our cloud-based learning modules.
Because this learning module will be accessible through cloud computing, students will
be able to concentrate on phylogeny analysis without the need to install software or verify
software versions initially. Leveraging our use cases, we will expose learners to the
diverse applications of phylogeny in biomedical science. The use of ""small"" datasets will
ensure that cloud computing resources are not over-allocated. Additionally, users will
have the ability to upload other sample data, and our module will include a data controller
responsible for validating input and parameters, ensuring they conform to the specified
""acceptable"" range before executing the workflow.
Impact: We will leverage our combined expertise to develop a Phylogeny Workflow Self-
Learning Module. This learning module will include instructional videos, an interactive
workflow implemented using Jupyter Notebook, and practical exercises that enable self-
learning with toy datasets. This resource will provide the educational community with a
valuable tool for understanding how biofilm impacts human health. The phylogeny
analysis workflow will be a versatile solution, allowing researchers to deploy it on various
platforms and apply it to a wide range of use cases."

A fundamental gap exists in the understanding of how developmental pathways are regulated to maintain
stem cell multipotency during extended periods of quiescence, or non-division. The FOXO family of
transcription factors are key regulators of stem cell maintenance and quiescence. However, the
mechanisms by which FOXO proteins impact developmental pathways to control cell fate are poorly
understood. This application capitalizes on the power of the C. elegans system to address the
mechanisms by which the single FOXO ortholog, daf-16, regulates conserved developmental pathways to
preserve stem cell multipotency during quiescence. To model stem cell quiescence, we will use the
quiescent dauer larva stage, adopted midway through development in response to adverse environmental
conditions. This approach is innovative because the C. elegans system allows us to study quiescent,
multipotent cells in vivo at single cell resolution, complementing mammalian studies. The long-term goal of
this lab is to decipher the mechanisms that promote multipotency during dauer. Epidermal seam cells, the
stem cell model, are multipotent and undergo a characteristic pattern of self-renewing cell divisions at
each larval stage until differentiating at adulthood. During dauer, seam cells are quiescent and active
mechanisms maintain multipotency. Preliminary data establish that during dauer, FOXO/daf-16 blocks
adult cell fate by positively regulating the expression of three genes that encode RNA-binding proteins
(RBPs). The orthologs of these RBPs regulate the proliferation and function of stem and progenitor cells in
flies and mammals. The objective of this application is to unravel the mechanisms by which FOXO/daf-16
acts via RBPs to regulate adult cell fate during the quiescent dauer stage. Three specific aims are
proposed to meet this objective. 1) Determine the genetic relationship between FOXO/daf-16 and RBPs.
Loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments will establish the regulation of RBPs by FOXO/daf-16, a
novel mechanism to control cell fate. 2) Identify direct RBP targets that block adult cell fate during
quiescence. Direct mRNA targets of RBPs will be identified by iCLIP. Functional testing will determine
which targets are involved in the regulation of seam cell fate. Together these experiments will elucidate
the connection between FOXO/daf-16-regulated RBPs and adult cell fate. 3) Dissect the transcriptional
regulation of an adult cell fate marker during quiescence. Preliminary data establish that during dauer,
FOXO/daf-16 and the three RBPs block expression of a transcriptional reporter of an adult-specific gene,
widely used to mark adult cell fate. Promoter dissection and functional testing of candidate transcription
factors will decipher the quiescence-specific regulation of a key adult cell fate marker. The proposed work
is significant because it will illuminate how the regulation of developmental pathways is coordinated with
the regulation of quiescence in multipotent cells."

The Arkansas Integrative Metabolic Research Center (AIMRC) is a Phase I COBRE at the University of Arkansas
at Fayetteville (04/01/2021-02/28/2026; PI: Dr. Kyle P. Quinn). The overall scientific objective of the AIMRC is to
investigate the role of cell and tissue metabolism in disease, development, and repair through research involving
advanced imaging, bioenergetics, and data science. The long-term objective of the AIMRC is to establish a
sustainable interdisciplinary research center that can support biomedical research at the U of A and grow the
emerging strengths in metabolic research on the University of Arkansas campus. The Bioenergetics Core
currently assists researchers with measurements of metabolic flux at the cell, isolated tissue, and whole animal
levels. Through the acquisition of an LC/Q-TOF mass spectrometer, this supplement will add the first and only
metabolomics capabilities on our campus. The comprehensive measurement of metabolites through the LC/Q-
TOF system will enable researchers to identify changes in flux through specific metabolic pathways and will
complement other sophisticated core instruments (including three Agilent Seahorse analyzers, an Oroboros O2
respirometer, BioTek Cytation 5 Imaging Multimode analyzer, and a Promethion metabolic cage system).
Collectively this suite of equipment will allow the AIMRC to provide valuable metabolic information under different
disease conditions at the molecular, cellular, tissue, and whole-body levels. Acquisition of the LC/Q-TOF mass
spectrometer will also help in obtaining a clear description of metabolites across a diverse set of biomedical
applications, and would enable the analysis of key biochemical pathways altered in functional genomics and
proteomics studies. More, importantly, the LC/Q-TOF will provide a unique resource to our campus and region.
It will be highly beneficial for the research proposed by current AIMRC COBRE research project leaders and
recruited new faculty who will be candidates for future advancement to research project leaders."
11037158,"The ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) are a family of six small, Ras-like GTPases best known for
their roles in membrane trafficking, where they control the formation of carrier vesicles at
multiple intracellular sites. Over the years, we have defined roles for ARFs and their regulators
(GEF and GAPs) in multiple cellular processes including endocytosis and post-endocytic
trafficking, and integration of ARF function with Rho family GTPases in the control of actin
cytoskeleton dynamics. More recently we have focused our attention on a subfamily of ARF
GEFs comprising three members, IQSec1, IQSec2 and IQSec3, that are unique among the 15
human ARF GEFs in their sensitivity to calcium signaling. We previously reported that IQSec2
controls the postsynaptic trafficking of AMPA receptors in excitatory neurons in response to
calcium influx and defined the molecular basis for mutations in IQSec1 identified in patients
with X-linked intellectual disability. Among the 3 IQSecs, only IQSec1 is ubiquitously expressed.
We determined that IQSec1 controls the trafficking of integrins in non-neuronal cells,
specifically in the disassembly of focal adhesions during cell migration. In this context, we found
that IQSec1 forms a complex with the lipid transfer protein ORP3, that translocates to
ER/plasma membrane contact sites immediately adjacent to focal adhesions, in response to
calcium influx via STIM/Orai1 calcium channels. This was the first demonstration that ER/PM
contacts are essential for adhesion disassembly. We determined that ORP3 has at least two
functions at contact sites – it extracts the plasma membrane phosphoinositide PI4P in exchange
for ER-derived phosphatidylcholine, while also allosterically activating IQSec1, driving
downstream activation of the ARF isoform ARF5. Both lipid exchange and ARF5 activation are
essential for adhesion turnover, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Deciphering
these mechanisms will be the focus of this R35 proposal. Preliminary data indicate that
microtubules, which contact focal adhesions and are necessary for disassembly, are
mistargeted in ORP3-deficient cells. Whether this is due to failure of lipid exchange or ARF5
activation will be investigated, as will the underlying mechanisms. Goals of the project include
identification of novel ARF5 effector proteins that function in this process, defining the
mechanisms through which insertion of PC into the PM leads to adhesion disassembly and
defining the relative roles and possible integration of ORP3/IQSec1 with other proteins that
concentrate at ER/PM contacts."

 Proton-transfer in proteins is a fundamental process underlying protein function, including
signaling/regulation, bioenergetics, and bio-catalysis. Understanding what triggers proton-transfer and how
proton-transfer drives subsequent functionally important structural transformations are of significant
importance to understand the structure-function relations of many proteins. Such research is hampered by
the paucity of widely accessible structural techniques for probing dynamic changes in proton positions
during protein function. The long-term goal of this project is to overcome this barrier by developing a time-
resolved infrared vibrational spectroscopy-based structural technology.
 Protein infrared spectra encode rich structural information and are particularly sensitive to cleavage
or formation of X-H bonds during proton-transfer. Time-resolved infrared technology consists of three steps:
i) detecting time-resolved infrared signals that capture protein structural dynamics; ii) identifying which
amino acids contribute to specific infrared signals; iii) reliably translating infrared signals into proton
positions in proteins. In this project, we will focus on detecting dynamic changes in proton positions in
histidine side chains during protein function, using a bacterial blue-light photoreceptor (PYP) as a model
system. The three protonation states of histidine are His+ (two protons, on N & N), His0D (a sole proton
on N), and His0E (a sole proton on N). Aim 1 is to detect pH-induced changes in protonation of buried
His108 and solvent-exposed His3 in static PYP; Aim 2 is to detect time-resolved dynamic changes in
protonation states of His108 in the signaling state upon light activation; and Aim 3 is to detect chemically
activated time-resolved proton transfer in PYP. We will use high-precision FT-IR (Aim 1), time-resolved
rapid-scan FT-IR (Aim 2), and integrating a microfluidic rapid-mixing device with an FT-IR microscope for
collecting 16,000 FT-IR spectra at once using a focal plane array detector (Aim 3). We will assign infrared
signals using specific isotope-editing combined with site-specific mutations. Histidine protonation states
will be derived using vibrational structural marker bands that we recently developed.
 The PI has extensive experience in advanced infrared technologies and is the director of Oklahoma
Center for Advanced Infrared Biology. The key collaborator is an expert in PYP, molecular biology and
isotope-editing of PYP. An NSF MRI funded state-of-the-art FT-IR system will be used for this project. Six
undergraduate students will carry out the FT-IR experiments, prepare various PYP samples, perform FT-
IR data analysis, contribute to FT-IR data interpretation, and present results at professional conferences.
Women, native American students, and other minority students will be encouraged to join the project via
University's three programs 1) Oklahoma Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation, 2) the Center for
Sovereign Nations, and 3) the Freshman Research Scholar program.
 The parent award focuses on developing new infrared-based technologies for protein structure and
structural dynamics. The requested equipment will bring extraordinary enhancements to time-resolved
study on protein structural dynamics (Aim 2). The requested equipment will increase the time-resolution
for protein structural dynamics from 10 milliseconds to 5.5 nanoseconds. This new experimental capability
from5.5 nanoseconds to 10 seconds (more than 9 orders of magnitude in time) will offer an unparalleled
structural tool to gain rich structural information underlying protein functions and is expected to make
significant impacts on the field of time-resolved protein structural biology and its applications to medically
important proteins."

The studies described in this proposal seek to develop strategies for the synthesis of strained rings and
heterocycles for two purposes: 1) the first total syntheses of novel azetidine-containing metabolites, and 2) rapid
access to bifunctional strained ring and heterocycle building blocks. Regarding the first purpose, total syntheses
of azetidomonamide A, azetidopyridone, and diazetidomonapyridone do not exist and are sorely needed so their
biological functions in quorum-sensing behavior can be evaluated. These metabolites affect biofilm formation
and production of redox-active metabolites in P. aeruginosa, which is partially implicated in adverse outcomes
for cystic fibrosis patients. Thus, total syntheses of these metabolites are highly needed and will have a broader
impact on human health through expanding understanding of biofilm formation by P. aeruginosa, and potentially
allowing for development of anti-virulence treatments for it in the long term. For the second purpose, strained
rings and heterocycles are increasingly prevalent in pharmacological motifs; strategies to access modular
components are needed to enable expedient diversification and access to new bioactive molecules.
 For the syntheses of azetidomonamide A and diazetidomonapyridone (K99), we envision the
development of intramolecular cyclization reactions to establish key challenging frameworks in the molecules,
such as Z-exocyclic azetine moieties, 4/6 bicyclic pyridones, and 4/7 bicyclic carbamates. These efforts will not
only allow us to establish the total syntheses of these metabolites, but contribute more broadly to chemical
synthetic efforts in the development of new reactions to access these strained heterocyclic motifs.
 In the R00 component, we propose the development of organometallic methods to achieve the syntheses
of bifunctional strained ring and heterocycle chemical building blocks. In the first phase, we anticipate diverting
organometallic intermediates to Favorskii-type reactivity to generate N-heterocycles that contain multiple
handles for further functionalization; in the second, we propose tuning organometallic intermediates to Ramberg-
Bäcklund reactivity to access substituted strained-ring derivatives. In doing so, we will broaden knowledge of
current chemical reactivity as well as provide strategies to make molecular scaffolds relevant to multiple
industries, including those pertaining to pharmaceuticals.
 Overall, the proposed research is significant because it provides creative strategies to 1) establish the
first total syntheses of azetidomonamide A and diazetidomonapyridone, which will enable their biological study,
and 2) develop new reactivity paradigms for accessing modular molecular scaffolds with pharmacological
relevance. Performing the K99 research in Prof. Reisman’s group at Caltech aligns well with their current success
in the efficient total synthesis of complex natural products; this experience in the synthesis of strained
heterocycles will augment my prior training in organometallic chemistry to prepare me for a future R1 academic
career in which I develop methods to access these types of motifs in broader contexts."

The deterioration of protein homeostasis is a signature of aging cells and underlies the etiology of numerous
aging-related diseases. Proteostasis is normally maintained through a well-coordinated network of factors that
include protein synthesis regulators, molecular chaperones that promote proper folding, quality control and
proteolytic degradation machinery. This proteostasis network serves to prevent the accumulation of misfolded,
non-functional, and aggregated proteins, which is particularly critical during stress and as cells age. Proteins
which function within the proteostasis network are highly-regulated by different mechanisms including their post-
translational modification. The modification lysine methylation has been identified on many factors that contribute
to proteostasis, though the molecular role for methylation within the proteostasis network remains poorly-defined.
The conserved SMYD family of lysine methyltransferases are known to methylate factors important to proteome
integrity, such as chaperones, although their function in maintaining proteostasis is not well-understood. We
have investigated the function of an orphan yeast SMYD lysine methyltransferase, Set6, and determined that it
is a critical regulator of the proteostasis network via its methyltransferase activity. The overarching goal of the
proposed work is to identify the specific regulatory role for Set6 in proteostasis and to define its catalytic activity
on factors important for proteome integrity, including the cytosolic chaperone Hsp70. To address this, we
propose to use a series of molecular and cell biological assays to dissect the molecular contribution of Set6 and
its catalytic activity to the proteostasis network under normal and stress conditions. We will also use quantitative
proteomics, structure-function analysis, and genetic approaches to define regulatory mechanisms directing the
activity of Set6 under normal and stress conditions, with a focus on its protein-protein interactions. Finally, we
will define the molecular consequences of Set6-dependent methylation on Hsp70 using molecular, biochemical,
and genetic approaches, and test the hypothesis that methylation by Set6 alters the Hsp70 interactome during
stress. We will also investigate whether Set6 has additional substrates in the proteostasis network using
biochemical, proteomic, and genetic assays. Altogether, these studies will reveal new regulatory mechanisms
governing the proteostasis network and will advance our understanding of the roles for SMYD enzymes in
proteome integrity. This work will also provide insight into aging-related pathologies characterized by misfolded
or aggregated proteins and may uncover new mechanisms that can be targeted therapeutically to promote
healthy proteostasis as cells age and prevent age-dependent diseases."
11036561,"Project Summary: An administrative supplement is requested to support the purchase of a state-of-the-art
flow cytometer (Cytek Aurora 4 laser with small particle detector), which has been designed for high content
panels (>20 fluorophores in a single cell suspension) and evaluation of antigens on extracellular vessicles (i.e.,
via a small particle detector. The Aurora takes advantage of spectral flow cytometry technology, where a full
fluorescence emission spectrum is collected following cell excitation with various lasers (red, yellow-green,
blue, violet), and then the spectra are deconvolved (i.e., “unmixed”) such that each of the 20+ distinct
fluorophores can be quantified. This allows quantification of many antigens on a single cell or extracellular
vesicle, dramatically expanding the range of biological or immunological questions that the experiment can
interrogate. This new equipment capability, which is not available at the University of Oklahoma (OU), will
significantly advance the principal investigator (PI)’s ability to do cutting-edge research in the areas of drug
delivery, immunoengineering, and inflammation. The ability to elevate immunoengineering and inflammation
research to this next level will make a pivotal positive contribution toward the PI’s career as general medical
research and an extramurally funded NIH/NIGMS investigator. The associated research project is currently
funded via the NIH/NIGMS R35 mechanism. Letters of support are provided, confirming broad support for this
equipment’s purchase and implementation at OU, by multiple NIGMS-funded investigators, the PI’s home
department, and a broad network of immunoengineering collaborators at OU and OU Health Sciences Center
(OUHSC). Further, a fee-based shared use model is described, to ensure the long-term sustainability of
maintaining the instrument (i.e., with consumables, supplies, and manufacturer contracts for preventative
maintenance) for research use. If funded, the PI commits to making the equipment available to the University
of Oklahoma (OU) research community via an established core facility model (Immunoengineering Core). A
letter of support from the core director is provided, confirming this institutional plan and support. The PI will
further encourage expanded equipment use through focused trainings or technical workshops. The PI will
focus training efforts on accelerating instrument access for early-stage investigators (ESI) at OU who, with the
additional technical and equipment support, could become future NIGMS investigators as PI."

The overall goal of the Center of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) in Neurodevelopment and Its
Disorders (CNDD) is to enhance research capacity by enabling outstanding multidisciplinary collaborative
research in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC). This area
is of importance to the state of South Carolina as the diagnosis rate and proportion of individuals with Autism
Spectrum Disorder (ASD) who have significant cognitive impairments is estimated to be higher than those of the
nation. The specific aims are to: 1) Mentor a strong cadre of early career scientists to become independently
funded investigators in NDD research; 2) Establish sustainable core resources to support modern NDD research
while leveraging institutional investments; and 3) Promote sustainability of the CNDD through creation of
multidisciplinary research programs, rigorous evaluation, strategic improvement, and mission alignment with
other Centers at MUSC and across the state of South Carolina. The Center is led by a multidisciplinary team,
composed of a department chair with extensive experience in molecular neurobiology, an expert in the field of
complement biology, and a clinical psychologist focused on ASD research within the MUSC College of Medicine,
coalescing resources to achieve their overarching objective of building a critical mass of funded investigators
that will allow MUSC to compete for future external peer-reviewed programmatic grant support. This application
highlights four of our most outstanding research project leaders (RPLs) who will benefit from an innovative
multiple source mentoring plan which features both internal and external mentors. We anticipate each of these
RPLs to transition to independent NIH funding within the first three years of the project. The CNDD also includes
three Cores, including an administrative core, that will support not only the RPLs but also NDD investigators
throughout MUSC. Scientific cores include the: 1) Genomic and Bioinformatic Core, which will provide technical
assistance, computational infrastructure, and training opportunities, and 2) Mouse Behavioral Phenotyping Core,
which will provide access to and training in behavioral analyses of mice. Additionally, the CNDD will foster
collaborations among NDD researchers by promoting interdisciplinary scientific exchange through our
enrichment activities and build research capabilities through our Pilot Project Program. With NIH and institutional
support, the expansion of research capabilities, development of RPLs, and promotion of integrative,
multidisciplinary NDD research programs, the proposed CNDD will substantially enhance basic, translational,
and clinical research at MUSC. Together with key institutional investments across the state, the CNDD will enable
the formation of a sustainable, thriving hub of world-class research in neurodevelopment and its disorders in
South Carolina."

Non-membrane nuclear assemblies further compartmentalize nuclear processes, but their dynamics and
functionality remain evasive. Components of telomerase RNP can localize to Cajal Body (CB) and Nucleoli -
cellular structures commonly known to promote RNP biogenesis. Our preliminary results, supported in part by
the parental R35-MIRA GM150538, demonstrated that telomerase functions are impeded by localization to CB
or nucleoli, which thereby imprisons telomerase. Our experimental approaches have been limited to end-point
telomerase enzymatic assay and IF/FISH performed on fixed cell lines. To critically examine our “telomerase
imprisoning” model, we aim to capture the live action of telomerase in relationship to CB and nucleoli, and to
capture the dynamics of nuclear organelles in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) undergoing lineage
differentiation. After several demos, we propose the acquisition of a 4D holo-tomographic optical nanoscope
manufactured by NanoLive, Switzerland.
Using the onsite-demo NanoLive system, we were able to acquire high-resolution, 3D-reconstituted, time-lapse
movies of the nuclear landscape, from which we were able to morphologically distinguish putative nuclear
structures including nucleoli, Cajal Body, and nuclear speckle - all label-free. We were able to confirm their
identity using correlative epifluorescence. The direct visualization of these nuclear structures perfectly
complements the telomere live cell technique that we have developed and can greatly facilitate our investigation
into the dynamic interplay between telomeres and CB. In addition, the non-invasive nature of the NanoLive
enables our continuous long-term imaging of hESCs undergoing cell cycle progression and lineage differentiation
without incurring phototoxicity. This will afford us unprecedented opportunities to visualize the morphological
remodeling of the RNA regulatory landscape during stem cell fate specification. The NanoLive system, if granted,
will serve as the workhorse of the parental R35, including its additional important utility in 1) the proposed
“prisonbreak” high-throughput screening due to its fully-automated platform and AI-powered cell death
quantitation, 2) characterization of the photoswitchable telomerase, and 3) the CAR-T cell killing assay.
The institute will provide a matching fund for the initial purchase as well as 100% of service contracts throughout
the life of the parental R35. Multiple NIH/NIGMS-funded research labs also have shown great interest in
NanoLive during the onsite demo and will be benefiting from this grant."
11036839,"Project Summary
The Evers laboratory studies the binding interactions of neurosteroids and cholesterol with integral membrane
proteins, with the aim of identifying the specific binding events underlying sterol modulation of protein function.
Our major focus is on neurosteroid (NS) modulation of -aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABAA-
R). Neurosteroids are important modulators of neuronal excitability and nervous system development with
enormous therapeutic potential as anesthetics, anti-depressants and neuro-protectants. We have shown
that there are multiple, subunit-specific binding sites for neurosteroids on GABAA receptors, each of which
contributes to the functional effects of neurosteroids. In the proposed research, we will use photolabeling
techniques to define the precise sites at which the major classes of neurosteroids bind on the most abundant
forms of synaptic and extra-synaptic GABAA receptors and determine the functional significance of each
identified binding site by assessing the effect of targeted amino acid substitutions on NS modulation of GABAA-
R currents. To identify photo-labeled residues we will utilize state-of-the-art protein chemistry and expression
techniques in conjunction with cutting edge mass spectrometry (MS) methods, including middle-down and
intact protein MS. High-resolution cryogenic-electron microscopy structures will be obtained to identify the
atomic details of novel NS binding sites and to investigate binding interactions that appear to stabilize
conformations not captured in current structures. Fluorescence-based binding assays will then be used to
measure the site-specific affinity of various NS for the identified binding sites. These assays will be
adapted to stopped-flow fluorimetry to determine the state-dependence of binding and to a plate reader
format to screen for site-specific agonists and antagonists. The long term goal of our NS program is to
develop and use site-specific NS ligands to probe the role of specific NS binding sites and GABAA-R subtypes
in the behavioral effects of endogenous NS and the mechanisms of action of NS sedatives and anesthetics.
 We have also used cholesterol-analogue photolabeling to identify specific binding sites that
mediate cholesterol inhibition of the lipid scramblase, nhTMEM16, and cholesterol modulation of
mTOR1 by the lysosomal membrane protein GPR155. Both nhTMEM16 and GPR155 have two specific
cholesterol binding sites per protein monomer and we are using targeted amino acid substitution to
understand the functional role of each site. We are also developing fluorescence-based binding assays to
measure cholesterol affinity and sterol specificity for these sites. Novel cholesterol binding sites present new
targets for small molecule allosteric modulators of membrane protein function and the tools we have
developed are widely applicable to identifying binding sites on other cholesterol-modulated proteins and
screening for site-specific ligands."
11037056,"Project Summary
 Funds are requested to purchase a new CEM (Discover-2.0) microwave synthesis reactor, which will be installed in
the Dow Science building (Dow 345) at Central Michigan University (CMU). Microwave reactors can raise temperatures
rapidly by irradiating polar materials in a chemical reaction with microwave energy. In addition to rapid heating, they can
carry out chemical reactions under high pressure, enabling the reactions to be heated beyond the boiling point of the
solvent being used. Therefore, microwave reactions are much faster compared to thermally heated reactions.
 Our proposed research is to synthesize and evaluate antioxidant dendrimers formed by joining dendrons with various
solubilities to attain solubilities that are biocompatible. All the dendrons and dendrimers involved in this research are
designed to produce strong antioxidant activity but no pro-oxidant effects by trapping the transition metal ions within their
interior. To attach antioxidant building blocks to a scaffold in our dendron/dendrimer synthesis, we use “alkyne-azide
click chemistry”, which requires a copper catalyst. The use of copper ions as catalysts results in severe contamination of
our dendrimer with copper ions due to the ability of the dendrimer to chelate copper ions. Therefore, we use copper metal
granules instead. Copper metal is a far less efficient catalyst than copper ions, but it does not contaminate our antioxidant
products, which is very important. To accelerate the reaction rates, we utilize a microwave reactor with which we can
form our target products usually in 10-15 hours (> 1 week without).
 We have a 14-year-old microwave reactor which fails very frequently due to its deteriorating parts with age. It is
difficult to start, and if it starts it only runs for 2-3 hours at a time. Without a microwave, our current grant-funded
research will be greatly impacted because long synthesis times will hamper other objectives to be achieved within the
proposed time frame. Currently there are no other microwave reactors in the entire CMU community. In summary, (i)
availability of a microwave reactor is extremely important for syntheses of our proposed dendrons and dendrimers, which
are large and complex molecules and (ii) this supplementary funding will allow us to train undergraduate/graduate
research students. We believe that procurement of a state-of-the-art microwave unit with this Administrative Supplement
will help accelerate the pace of our proposed research as well as help students acquire useful modern microwave synthesis
techniques."
11037061,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The desmosome cell-cell adhesion complex plays an important role in the maintenance of tissue structure
and integrity in response to mechanical stress. In addition to this central adhesive role, desmosomal
proteins also coordinate multiple processes such as proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation and cell
migration. Prior studies show that desmosomal cadherins, the proteins responsible for mediating the
extracellular attachment between cells, can have both pro- and anti-migratory functions, indicating that their
influence on migration is more complex than a simple consequence of defective cell-cell attachment. Our
recent work has shown that loss of the cadherin Desmoglein-2 (DSG2) triggers increased activation of the
Rap1 GTPase, leading to enhanced cell spreading on extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins (such as
fibronectin and collagen). As these experiments were performed on singly spreading cells, we have
identified a novel cell-autonomous, cell-cell adhesion independent role for DSG2 in the regulation of cell
spreading. Nevertheless, the signaling mechanisms via which DSG2 regulates Rap1 activity remain
unknown. Our preliminary data also shows that localization of the Rap1 activator PDZ-GEF2 is dramatically
altered in DSG2 knockout cells, and that knockdown of the desmosomal protein Desmoplakin (DSP) can
rescue both the enhanced spreading and mis-localization of PDZ-GEF2 seen in these cells. Further, we
have obtained evidence that loss of DSG2 increases ECM gene expression via deregulated Src and NF-kB
signaling. In this proposal, we will test the central hypothesis that DSG2 orchestrates cell-matrix
adhesion and spreading through control of both inside-out signaling (via Rap1 GEFs) and outside-in
signaling (via ECM gene expression). In Aim 1, we will investigate whether binding of PDZ-GEF2 to
DSG2 or DSP reduces its activity, thereby inducing inside-out control of cell spreading via inhibition of Rap1
signaling. In Aim 2, we will explore a role for NF-kB and Src signaling in DSG2-dependent ECM gene
expression, and whether this promotes outside-in control of cell-matrix spreading and migration. Finally, in
Aim 3, we will explore the hypothesis that the ability of DSG2 to regulate cell migration is independent of its
extracellular domains and/or localization to the cell membrane. The scientific impact of these data will be
to produce a comprehensive picture of the molecular mechanisms by which the desmosomal cadherin
DSG2 coordinates both inside-out and outside-in signaling to control cell-matrix adhesion, spreading and
migration, functions critical for biological processes such as tissue morphogenesis, wound healing and re-
epithelialization. The training impact of these data will be to provide undergraduate students at Furman
University (a primarily undergraduate institution) with foundational skills in the scientific method, foster their
desire to tackle important biological problems and pursue a career in the biomedical sciences."
11037076,"The Influence of Neuronal States on Perception and Behavior
Unlike reflexes, most of our behaviors are governed by internal states such as satiety or arousal that influence how we
respond to our environment. The ability to regulate our internal state in response to experience is immediately evident
in mental pathologies where this process is broken. In maladaptive disorders such as Attention Hyperactivity Deficit
Disorder (ADHD) or Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), the brain’s ability to properly coordinate salient sensory
inputs with appropriate behavioral responses is fundamentally flawed, and in extreme psychiatric disorders such as
schizophrenia, sensory information is nearly shut-out entirely, as nearly all behaviors are driven by internal
representations of the world, i.e. hallucinations and delusions. Functional understandings of how these disorders arise
are very limited, in part because of the complexity of the underlying processes that produce these behaviors. However,
researching internal states in non-humans is challenging for two reasons. 1. These states are often encoded by
neuromodulators, but are behaviorally defined based on the probabilities of observed behaviors; the organisms often do
not leave a record of their intent. To simplify analysis, these assays often investigate binary states such as satiety vs.
hunger, arousal vs. not aroused, even though natural behaviors are not necessarily bimodal. 2. How neuromodulators
alter specific synaptic relationships in a circuit is daunting in unannotated, complex circuits.
However, both of these challenges can be addressed by using the right model system. Animals that build structures in
defined phases, such as orb-weaving spiders, leave a physical record of their behavioral intent, thus simplifying the
definition of behavioral states. These paradigms are also more ethologically relevant, as the animals are allowed to
perform complex behaviors without the need for learning an artificial binary tasks. Likewise, small animals like C. elegans
have defined and annotated synaptic topologies that can be investigated under different neuromodulatory contexts,
providing us with an unparalleled ability to understand neuromodulatory rewiring with single neuron resolution. More
specifically, how neuron computations like synergistic integration are altered can be addressed in explicitly defined
neurons and synapses. My long-term goal is to understand how internal states organize behavior, and more explicitly,
how the neuromodulators that define these states alter the function of neuronal circuits.
We aim to make two key advancements in the field. 1) We will build a neuromodulatory map of how these pathways
coordinate multiple behaviors beyond a binary paradigm. 2) We will quantify how internal states modulate synergistic
coupling between neurons."

11036630,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Enteric bacterial infections remain one of the greatest public health challenges worldwide and deciphering the
mechanisms that protect against infection will enable development of new treatments. Intestinal tissues are in
constant direct contact with diverse beneficial and pathogenic microbes, highlighting the need for orchestrating
complex microbial signals to sustain protection against infection. Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) reside at the
direct interface between intestinal pathogens, beneficial commensal bacteria, and intestinal immune
components. However, despite continuous exposure to diverse microbes, the mechanisms regulating how IECs
integrate microbial-derived signals to mount protective host responses to pathogens are not well understood.
The goals of this proposal are to interrogate how specific commensal bacterial-derived metabolites are sensed
by IECs to protect against pathogenic infection. Employing Citrobacter rodentium, a murine model of human
enteropathogenic Escherichia coli infection, our studies have identified that microbiota-derived products protect
against intestinal damage and enteric bacterial infection. Our epigenetic analyses for this project led to
identification of new commensal bacterial-derived metabolites that can directly regulate IECs and prime host
defense against pathogenic bacterial infection. Employing an exciting array of transgenic animals, pathogenic
and commensal bacterial strains, and human intestinal organoids, three specific aims are proposed that will (i)
decipher how the host calibrates intestinal barrier function by sensing newly-identified commensal bacterial-
derived metabolites, (ii) investigate metabolite-dependent regulation of enteric infection, and (iii) interrogate how
metabolism of dietary components by commensal bacteria prime the epigenome and enhance host response to
pathogenic bacteria. Defining pathways that integrate commensal and pathogenic signals will provide a
framework to test the therapeutic potential of manipulating commensal bacterial-derived metabolites to promote
antibacterial immunity."

In the Kleiner laboratory we study metabolism, physiology and interactions in microbial symbioses and host-
associated microbiota. For this we combine a diversity of cultivation independent approaches – such as
metagenomics, metabolomics, metaproteomics and single cell imaging – with cultivation-based approaches
including heterologous gene expression, biochemical assays and other in vitro measurements. Our research
has a strong focus on the development of high-resolution mass spectrometry driven metaproteomics for the
large-scale identification and quantification of proteins in host-associated microbiota.
During the next five years, I plan to continue using these approaches to study intestinal microbiota responses
to, and mechanisms of interaction with, external substrates (diet) and host-derived substrates (host compound
foraging). I hypothesize that different dietary protein sources and host-derived compounds will have vastly
different impacts on the microbiota and thus need to be considered when studying the interconnection of diet,
the microbiota, and host health. I propose to use metaproteomics, complemented with metagenomics and
metabolomics, to (1) identify and quantify the substrates that are used and converted by microbiota members
and (2) determine how these substrates impact community composition and functional interactions with other
microbiota members and the host. This research will provide urgently needed insight into the functional
impacts of substrates consumed by gut microbiota by optimizing and deploying novel approaches for the
reproducible, large-scale characterization of host, diet and microbial proteins in the intestinal tract.
My long-term goals are to develop metaproteomic approaches that allow us to quantitatively and reproducibly
determine functional interactions in microbial communities, and to define critical interactions between the
microbiota and dietary proteins that will inform the development of therapeutic interventions. These
approaches will also be powerful tools for studying any disease associated with the human microbiome in and
on different body sites and microbial communities that humans interact with in their environment and that
potentially impact health."

Suicide is a leading cause of premature death in the United States (US). Convergent evidence across
genetic, postmortem, and immunohistochemical studies suggest a role for altered glutamate (Glu)—the
amino acid neurotransmitter that mediate most of the brain's fast excitatory transmission—in the
pathogenesis of suicide. Still, there is little research to-date on brain glutamate concentrations measured in
vivo in suicidal populations. Moreover, no study has examined alterations in activity-dependent dynamic
glutamate responses underlying mood- and cognition-related risk factors for suicide. This K08 project will
use magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to quantify in vivo steady-state Glu concentrations and
dynamic glutamate responses in n=70 currently depressed participants with and without a history of suicidal
behavior (MDD+SA and MDD-SA, respectively) and n=30 healthy volunteers (HV). Steady-state Glu will be
imaged across the length of the brain using MR spectroscopy imaging (MRSI). We will also use functional
MRS (fMRS) to detect activity-dependent changes in glutamate. Participants will complete two functional
tasks during MRS scanning: a pain-inducing cold pressor task (CPT) and a neurocognitive task (Stroop);
and dynamic glutamate activity (GluΔ) will be measured in response to these tasks. The group design will
allow us to parse suicide- and depression-related alterations in Glu signaling. Salivary cortisol
measurements will be obtained before and after the MRS scan. Participants will also complete seven days
of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) during which they will report on suicidal ideation, affect, and
stressors, six times daily. This will allow evaluation of the relationship between Glu signaling and
vulnerability to stress-related suicidal ideation/mood symptoms in daily life. We hypothesize that MDD+SAs
will exhibit altered cortical Glu concentrations and attenuated responses to physical pain stimulation,
compared with MDD-SAs and HVs. We will also evaluate whether dynamic glutamate responses to
functional tasks are associated with subjective pain responses, neurocognitive performance, cortisol stress
reactivity, and behavioral responses to naturalistic stressors. Understanding the contribution of altered brain
glutamate to suicide risk may help to facilitate development of pharmacological treatments that can
overcome limitations of existing monoamine-focused antidepressants currently used for treatment of suicide
risk."
11037386,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The Organizing Concept of the parent Phase II COBRE in Stroke Recovery is that better understanding of the
experience-dependent nature of neural plasticity allows us to investigate and exploit inherent neural recovery
processes, develop and translate novel mechanism-based interventional strategies, and ultimately improve the
function and quality of life of individuals recovering from stroke. And Overall Specific Aim 2 focuses on
strengthening innovative scientific cores that support/advance stroke recovery research – such as the Brain
Stimulation Core. Transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) offers unprecedented spatial resolution and depth of
focus versus other methods of non-invasive brain stimulation - such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS),
transcranial electrical stimulation (tES), or deep brain stimulation (DBS) - and has been shown to be a safe and
effective method of delivering precise ultrasonic energy to the brain without causing tissue damage or lasting
neurological effects. The existing technology used by COBRE investigators has significant limitations. In direct
alignment with the Organizing Concept and Overall Specific Aim above, we propose to acquire the first-in-class,
state-of-the art transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) targeting, navigation, and sonication platform for
administration of noninvasive deep brain stimulation (the NeuroFUS Pro Neuronavigated tFUS System). This
platform will serve a pioneering suite of equipment designed to advance novel interventions for post stroke motor
recovery, cognitive impairment, depression, and pain using the emerging new technology of ultrasound. This
proprietary cutting-edge system incorporates technology that 1) allows for the advancement of focused
ultrasound interventions in a stroke population, 2) enables precision administration with sub-centimeter spatial
resolution of individual brain targets relevant to stroke recovery, 3) variable penetration depths ranging from 20-
80mm allowing for whole brain targets for cortical or subcortical sonication, 4) optimize sonication parameters
and compare the calculated exposure and dose parameters based on individual skull and brain anatomy, and 5)
administer tFUS using individual MRI targeting to conduct mechanistic and behavioral experiments that can
rapidly advance this area of research. Taken together, this advanced focused ultrasound platform promises to
make a large leap in the area of post-stroke rehabilitation by enabling access to previously inaccessible stroke-
related brain areas. It will allow us to create new potential treatments for stroke recovery and allow us to further
strengthen our research program through additional NIH funding opportunities. Such opportunities are a
cornerstone of our COBRE sustainability plan to continue to thrive after Phase III."
11037169,"Far-field fluorescence microscopy is a powerful tool in biological research due to its live cell compatibility and
molecular specificity. A major hurdle over the last ~100 years has been the limited resolution due to the diffraction
of light. Modern super-resolution microscopy methods such as single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM)
overcame this fundamental barrier and improved the resolution of fluorescence microscopy ten-fold by
stochastically switching single dyes on and off such that their emission events are separated in time. This allows
their center positions to be localized with high precision in space, leading to a reconstructed super-resolved
image with a resolution down to ~25 nm.
However, current developments and applications of SMLM focus on fixed cells in thin samples and cellular
structures that lie close to the coverslip surface. Indeed, the profound impact of SMLM on biomedical studies
has yet to fully unfold due to the following limitations: (1) live-cell SMLM is slow and difficult to achieve ultrahigh
resolution due to the small photon budget, the insufficient information carried per photon, and the required high
excitation power; (2) SMLM through large tissue depths remains difficult, due to the rapidly deteriorating
resolution and image fidelity in tissue specimens caused by aberration and fluorescence background; and, (3)
molecular resolution (1-5 nm) is yet achievable in whole cells and tissues at low photon flux conditions.
Overcoming these hurdles will help reveal the structure, function and dynamics for cellular constituents at the
molecular resolution in living specimens, and the reconstruction of nanoscale maps of multiple protein species
within a large tissue volume. These capacities will drastically expand the impact of SMLM applications.
Our long-term goal is to develop novel optical imaging systems that achieve significant advances in defining
the structure and function of cellular constituents in live cells and tissues with molecular resolution. In the next
five years, we will focus on two research directions: (1) We will develop novel single molecule super-resolution
imaging technologies and a phase-encoded localization method to enable molecular-resolution 3D imaging in
live cells under low photon flux conditions. The innovations will enable us to capture 3D dynamics with 1-5 nm
resolution and construct time-evolved structural models of macromolecular assemblies in live cells. (2) We will
develop novel instruments and analytical methods to allow ultra-high resolution, multiplexed mapping of
fluorescently labeled targets in large tissue volumes.
We will apply these developments to reveal the molecular organization and functions of networks of actin
filaments and myosins during the formation and constriction of the cytokinetic contractile ring in live fission yeast.
Also, we will determine the precise subcellular localization of molecular motors like dynein with respect to both
microtubule and actin in neuronal growth cones. We will also explore the correlation between nanoscale topology
of chromatin loci with defined epigenetic content and cell lineage and changes in gene expression profile.

and recruitment efforts.This will significantly improve our ability to identify and measure biomarkers and support
clinical and translational investigators in diseases that are highly prevalent in our population, such as
cardiometabolic diseases, cancer, and emerging infectious diseases. Additionally, the requested funds will
provide an increased capacity to perform more comprehensive basic characterization of cellular and molecular
processes at the single-cell “omics” level, through the use of a state-of-the-art single cell analysis system. This
will be of great value for supporting studies working with in-vitro models and patient derived cells. The requested

The ability to sense dynamic changes in the cellular microenvironment and translate that information into rewired
biomolecular interactions forms the backbone of cellular signal transduction. Despite significant interest and
investment in methods capable of detecting and quantifying protein-protein and other protein-biomolecule
interactions, the most commonly employed methods solely map interaction in non-physiologic environments
outside of cells where many important factors contributing to the interactions under study are lost. These methods
are particularly poorly suited to study signaling events in cells that rely on the cellular architecture and chemical
environment in order to form and function. Therefore, new methods are needed to quantitatively map protein
“social networks” inside of living systems. Here we propose to develop and validate several complementary light-
dependent proximity profiling platforms capable of detecting protein interaction dynamics in live cells with high
spatial and temporal resolution, as well as minimal perturbation to the cellular environment. We will accomplish
this goal through three interconnected aims that are supported by preliminary data and our previously published
work with an intracellular photoproximity profiling platform. First, we will synthesize and test tunable
photoproximity chemical probes to map protein complexes at nanometer scale inside of cells. In parallel, we
propose to test potentially more efficient catalytic photoproximity profiling platforms for increased resolution of
low abundance macromolecular complexes inside of cells. Finally, we propose to apply these platforms to study
the dynamic sensing of altered metabolic and redox stress inside cells through the integrated antioxidant and
unfolded protein response pathways. These proximity profiles will enable drafting of the first quantitative,

This career development award focuses on training Dr. Bella Mehta (applicant) on pain phenotyping in
osteoarthritis (OA) patients and linking phenotyping data to tissue level data distinguishing between pain
experienced during activity and pain at rest. The study will enhance the goals of the Restoring Joint Health
and Function to Reduce Pain (RE-JOIN) consortium, an effort led by the NIH HEAL Initiative. The goals of
the consortium are to understand the synoviocyte-nerve interactome, which complements the focus of this
career development award. Knee OA is a prevalent condition causing chronic pain and disability, particularly
among the elderly population. Dr. Mehta has been a part of the human phenotyping working group of the
consortium and involved in meetings with pain research experts to explore precise pain phenotyping and the
utility of Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST). There is heterogeneity in patient reported knee pain knee OA
pain, with different timings, activity/rest related and anatomical distributions. Preliminary analysis from our
data suggests distinct histological patterns in bone and synovium associated with activity-limited pain versus
pain that persists at rest. The proposal aims to collect precise location and severity data of knee pain, which,
when combined with histology and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), will help identify pathological
changes contributing to different pain types. As part of the RE-JOIN consortium we will recruit 110 patients
and add detailed pain phenotyping as a per of this career development award. Aim 1 focuses on patients
with activity-limited pain, while Aim 2 focuses on rest related pain and compares sites of knee pain with QST,
histology, and MRI changes from the medial and lateral sites. To achieve these research aims, a diverse
team of multidisciplinary experts in a variety of fields and disciplines have committed their mentorship and
support to the research endeavors and ultimately the growth of the applicant as an independent researcher.
Drs. Tuhina Neogi, Dana Orange, and Anne Marie Malfait will each contribute their extensive knowledge and
mentorship in the fields of rheumatology and underlying molecular mechanisms, with an emphasis on pain
mechanisms and osteoarthritis. Three training objectives will guide this transition to independence as a
physician-researcher. Training Objective 1 aims to attain expertise in understanding and applying various
conceptual models and methods to research focused on clinical pain assessments in OA. Training Objective
2 will drive the development of expertise in assessment and evaluation of QST, including its impact on
patient reported outcome measures. Lastly, Training Objective 3 will provide a comprehensive
understanding of histopathology in OA, including synovium, bone, and cartilage features. Mastery of QST
and clinical pain phenotyping along with histological understanding will enhance the research's impact, assist
Dr. Mehta in her growth as a pain researcher in the ﬁeld, and subsequently in dissemination of this
knowledge at the Hospital for Special Surgery, a leading institution in musculoskeletal disease."

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with impaired social
communications and behavioral abnormalities, which affects ~1 in 54 children in the United States (CDC.gov).
SCN2A, encoding neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.2, has been identified as one of the leading
genes associated with ASD. We have characterized a novel Scn2a-deficient mouse model that is generated via
targeted gene-trap knockout (gtKO) strategy and possesses a built-in genetic rescue element. Our preliminary
data revealed profound behavioral abnormalities in homozygous Scn2agtKO/gtKO mice including anxiety-like
behaviors, impaired nesting and social deficits. We also identified elevated excitation-inhibition (E/I) balance in
pyramidal neurons of mPFC, which has been implicated in ASD and social deficits. However, a critical gap exists
regarding how in vivo neuronal firings in mPFC are affected by elevated E/I balance and to what extent the
manipulation of E/I balance will alter the behavioral outcomes in Scn2agtKO/gtKO mice. To address this gap, we
propose to test an overarching hypothesis that Scn2a deficiency increases E/I balance, impairs neuronal
responses in mPFC, and results in social deficits that can be rescued with targeted genetic and pharmacological
interventions. In Aim 1, we will assess the synaptic properties and in vivo firing of neurons in mPFC using brain-
slice patch-clamp recording and Neuropixels in vivo recording. Our findings are expected to provide cellular-level
and local network level neuropathological mechanisms of Scn2a deficiency. In Aim 2, we will determine neuronal
firings and behavioral outcomes in response to manipulating E/I balance in mPFC microcircuit using optogenetics
and chemogenetics. Our findings will bolster the significance of E/I balance modulation for correction of
behavioral deficits. In Aim 3, we will evaluate the efficacy of timed genetic and pharmacological rescue to
determine optimal windows for intervention. Our study is significant in the following ways: i) SCN2A deficiency
to be studied is among the leading monogenetic forms of ASD; ii) Excitation and inhibition (E/I) balance of mPFC
microcircuit to be thoroughly dissected is closely associated with social deficits; and iii) Genetic rescue and
pharmacological intervention to be tested are of clear clinical relevance, and will provide translational basis to
inform therapeutic development for the treatment of Scn2a-deficiency related disorders. Our study has the
following innovations: i) use of novel Scn2agtKO/gtKO mice that display profound cellular and behavioral deficits; ii)
innovative ways to achieve genetic and pharmacological rescue; and iii) use of cutting-edge technologies
including high density Neuropixels in vivo recordings. The applicant is an early stage investigator (ESI), whose
team has extensive expertise in sodium channel electrophysiology, animal behaviors, genetics and
pharmacology. The team is well suited to carry out the proposed work to its full completion within the project
timeframe, and generate impactful outcomes to advance the field."
11035664,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The central nervous system comprises the tissues and cells with the highest rate of alternative splicing in the
body, and RNA-binding proteins play a major functional role in neurons. To better understand the contribution
of RNA splicing to nerve cell biology, and to help elucidate the function that splicing plays in neuron physiology
and neurologic disorders it is necessary to characterize how the inclusion or skipping of specific exons
modulates the physiological properties of molecules — such as ion channels — that are critical for neuronal
function, and to characterize how these splicing events are regulated at the cellular and molecular level. Our
long-term goal is to understand the molecular mechanisms regulating protein-RNA networks that control
alternative splicing in the brain, and how they relate to the biology of neurons and to disorders of the nervous
system. The objective of this proposal is to study how alternative splicing of CaV3.1, a voltage-gated Calcium
channel that significantly contributes to the regulation of cell membrane excitability — particularly in muscle
and neurons — and that is mutated in patients with spinocerebellar ataxia-42 (SCA42) is regulated in different
neuron cell types, and how it may contributes to the modulation of channel activity. The central hypothesis of
this proposal is that neuronal cell type-specific alternative splicing of CaV3.1 at the C-terminus shapes the
physiological properties of this voltage-gated ion channel.
In Aim 1 we will test the hypothesis that CaV3.1 alternatively spliced exons are differentially expressed in
different neuronal cell types in the brain. To tackle this question, we have developed an RNAseq-based
bioinformatics pipeline that will allow us to interrogate differential splicing between neuronal subclasses defined
at different hierarchical levels. This methodology will not only provide a snapshot of the alternative splicing
landscape of CaV3.1 in different neuronal subclasses in the brain, but it will also allow us to generate
predictions on how these alternative splicing events are regulated. In Aim 2 we will test the hypothesis that
alternative splicing at the C-terminus significantly contributes to the regulation of the physiological activity of
this ion channel. Since several disease-associated mutations in CaV3.1 map to alternatively spliced exons,
understanding how alternative splicing modulates channel activity is critical.
Since patients with CaV3.1-associated pathologies display defects in Calcium current properties,
understanding how alternative splicing may modulate the biological functions of CaV3.1 and how this
modulation is regulated, may have broad and significant clinical implications in spinocerebellar ataxia, epilepsy,
and autism spectrum disorders, and it may inform the design of novel therapeutic strategies. Moreover, this
project will provide both undergraduate and graduate students with a unique opportunity to learn the
fundamentals of molecular biology and biomedical research and help them in their pursue of a career in the
biomedical field."
11035321,"Project Summary/Abstract
Over the past 20 years, the protein ASCC2 has been shown to contribute to the localization of numerous
multiprotein complexes involved in pathways such as DNA alkylation damage repair and the stalled ribosome
response. A common feature of several of these pathways is that they assemble K63-linked polyubiquitin chains
which are recognized by ASCC2 to recruit the appropriate multiprotein complexes. ASCC2 utilizes a CUE domain
to bind the K63-linked polyubiquitin chains, however, CUE domains are typically promiscuous ubiquitin binders,
and it is unclear how ASCC2 specifically recognizes K63-linked polyubiquitin chains among the myriad types of
polyubiquitin chains present in the cell. The overarching goal of the proposed experiments is to elucidate the
structural basis for ASCC2’s specificity for binding K63-linked polyubiquitin chains with the following specific
aims: 1) identify the intermolecular interactions that mediate binding between ASCC2 and K63-linked
polyubiquitin chains using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, 2) use integrative modeling to
create a representation of the interaction between ASCC2 and K63-linked polyubiquitin chains that agrees with
our experimentally determined NMR, mutagenesis, and small angle X-ray scattering data, and 3) quantify the
functional significance of the predicted interactions between ASCC2 and K63-linked polyubiquitin chains using
in vitro and cell-based assays. These studies are part of a broader effort to better understand the biological
pathways that depend on ASCC2’s ubiquitin-binding abilities and to diagnose diseases associated with the
malfunction of these pathways. For example, in the DNA alkylation damage repair pathway, mutations that inhibit
the formation of the K63-linked polyubiquitin chains that recruit ASCC2, and mutations that inhibit the interaction
between ASCC2 and other members of the ALKBH3-ASCC DNA repair complex, have recently been associated
with genetic diseases due to research in this area. Additionally, the proposed studies will provide valuable
research opportunities for students at Mount St. Mary’s University (MSMU). Collaborations with scientists at
Johns Hopkins University, Washington University in St. Louis, and the SIBYLS beamline at the Lawrence
Berkeley National Laboratory will allow the MSMU undergraduate researchers access to scientific
instrumentation that is not available on their home campus. Overall, the proposed studies will further our
understanding of how ASCC2 targets multiprotein complexes to sites marked by K63-linked polyubiquitin chains
while greatly enhancing the research opportunities available for students at MSMU."

Project Summary
This proposal is for a five-year research program for Dr. Jon Wisler, an Assistant Professor in the Division
of Trauma, Critical Care, and Burn Surgery. This proposal studies the mechanistic events and
immunosuppressive clinical consequences of epigenetic methylation events that occur in survivors of sepsis.
Dr. Wisler is a highly productive researcher in the fields of epigenetic regulation, sepsis, and clinical outcomes.
This proposal couples the knowledge and skills gained during Dr. Wisler’s NIH K08 program relating to
epigenetic regulation with direct application to clinical and psycho-social outcomes. Survivors of sepsis
exhibit a profound degree of immunosuppression with higher levels of functional decline, depression,
subsequent infections, and long-term mortality. To date, investigations related to his topic are fragmented and
lack synergy.
Jon’s research program seeks to unify multiple areas of investigation to improve the long-term outcomes
of survivors of sepsis. His preliminary data identifies that patients with sepsis exhibit significant increases in
DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) activity during sepsis. This results in profound gene silencing
and immunosuppression. Additionally, we show that survivors of surgical sepsis exhibit numerous negative
psycho-social effects that may represent the clinical effects of these epigenetically mediated
immunosuppression events. Our intent for this application is to integrate the research efforts of Dr. Wisler and
elucidate the deleterious clinical consequences of these epigenetic events coupled with in vivo targeting and
immune function restoration in animal models of sepsis. We hypothesize that molecular or
pharmacological means to control DNMT function has potential benefits to patients with sepsis for
boosting their innate immune function during the recovery phase of post-septic insult. Incorporating
and coordinating these areas of research will greatly improve our understanding of these epigenetic
events and provide a unified analysis of mechanistic, translational, and clinical outcomes. Under the
R35 program, Jon seeks to integrate cutting-edge laboratory based investigations and in vivo animal
modeling and therapeutic testing with patient based assessments including time-course based
immunologic dysfunction and altered clinical outcomes. Post-sepsis immunosuppression is an often
diagnosed but untreated consequence of sepsis survivorship. This program will establish the time course,
functional effects, and interventions to treat the underlying epigenetic events involved in this
immunosuppression. This will generate paradigm shifting treatments for a disease process with significant
clinical impact."
11037299,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A hallmark of eukaryotic cells is the ability to compartmentalize essential reactions into membrane-bound and
membrane-less organelles. Membrane-bound organelles form collaborative networks through transport vesicles
and inter-organellar interaction domains to traffic cargo and distribute lipids throughout the cell. Conversely,
membrane-less organelles mobilize the aqueous portion of cells into condensed structures called condensates.
The majority of membrane-less condensates enrich for RNAs and various proteins, which control RNA
processing and function at nearly every step of the mRNA life cycle. We and others have recently identified a
new class of inter-organelle interactions between membrane-bound organelles, such as the endoplasmic
reticulum, and membrane-less RNA-sequestering condensates, such as stress granules. Thus, the long-term
goal of my research program is to define how and why these two types of organelles interact to gain a more
seamless understanding of how the cytoplasm is organized in health and disease. The objective of this proposal
is to identify the factors and utilities of interaction domains between the endoplasmic reticulum and two well-
studied RNA-sequestering condensates. Our central hypothesis is that the endoplasmic reticulum plays crucial
roles in RNA condensate formation, maintenance, and disassembly through the formation of membrane-to-
condensate interactions. Although in vitro and in vivo studies on RNA and protein condensation have revealed
the some molecular and biophysical principles of condensates, the contribution of membranes to condensate
mechanisms are poorly understood. In the first Project, my lab will elucidate how condensate components are
recruited to the endoplasmic reticulum to stimulate RNA condensate formation and inhibition of mRNA
translation. We will use biochemical and live-cell imaging approaches to identify the key membrane factors that
control this new class of interaction domains. These studies will allow us to identify the molecular mechanisms
behind our previous discovery of a surprising dependence of membrane-less condensate abundance on
endoplasmic reticulum morphology. In the second Project, we will dissect endoplasmic reticulum-dependent
mechanisms of stress granule disassembly. Specifically, we will identify new disassembly factors by taking
advantage of our newly developed ability to uncouple stress granule fission from dissolution. Additionally, we will
test whether increasing the rate of endoplasmic reticulum-mediated stress granule fission can drive the
disassembly of disease-associated aggregates. Collectively, this work will reveal how a new cellular niche
between membrane-bound and membrane-less organelles drives the dynamic compartmentalization and quality
control of RNA processes. Therefore, we anticipate that the proposed work will have important implications for
both basic science and translational medicine targeting neurodegeneration, cancer, and RNA viral infection."

Cell division is orchestrated by the mitotic spindle, composed of hundreds of thousands of microtubules (MT).
Since the discovery of the MT building block tubulin 50 years ago, scientists have puzzled over how the mitotic
spindle assembles via MTs and executes chromosome segregation despite a MT turnover of seconds. Now we
know that spindle assembly relies largely on MT nucleation. Yet, when, where, and how MTs are nucleated, and
how they are subsequently incorporated into the bipolar spindle, remains unclear.
 Based on my discovery of branching MT nucleation, my laboratory contributed to understanding how several
essential factors, namely the protein complex augmin, the phase-separating protein TPX2, and the nucleator g-
TuRC, conduct this reaction. Meanwhile it has been shown that this mechanism creates a majority of MTs in a
spindle. As a result of this work, we are in an ideal position to investigate how branching MT nucleation is
incorporated into spindle assembly to produce a continuous MT framework supporting chromosome segregation.
We will pursue three aims: Aim 1: Determine where, when, and how MTs form in the vicinity of
chromosomes. We will observe exactly where and when MTs form at purified chromosomes in Xenopus egg
extract. We developed a novel assay to visualize MT nucleation from chromosomes, a direct visualization that
is difficult to do in living cells. Further, we will define the contribution toward MT generation of the RanGTP
pathway, branching MT nucleation, the chromosomal passenger complex, and the kinetochore. We hypothesize
that branching MT nucleation is the main source of MTs from chromosomes. Aim 2: Elucidate how importins
regulate onset of branching microtubule nucleation. RanGTP releases the spindle assembly factor TPX2
from importins, which then stimulates branching MT nucleation. Previous studies assumed that TPX2 exists as
a monomer. In contrast, we recently showed that the active form of TPX2 undergoes a liquid liquid phase
separation (LLPS), and importins inhibit this TPX2 condensate. How importins achieve inhibition of TPX2’s LLPS
is not only important for MT assembly but also widely relevant in cell biology, as few studies have described how
inhibition of LLPS can regulate cellular function. We will further assess whether the second essential branching
factor, augmin, is also regulated by RanGTP, a pathway that would provide additional control for cell-cycle
regulation. Aim 3: Provide mechanistic insight into the core branching factor augmin. To determine the
structural basis of augmin-medidated branching MT nucleation, we will solve the single particle cryo-EM structure
of augmin. This work will reveal the location and fold of augmin’s eight subunits. Using structure-function
analysis, we will investigate the functional interfaces through which augmin binds to MTs and g-TuRC, besides
interrogating how augmin and TPX2 interact. Achieving these aims will help answer open and pressing questions
in cell biology about how MT nucleation occurs in the correct location and at the correct time to assemble the
mitotic spindle."

The Myc gene family encodes three highly conserved transcription factors (N-, c-, L-), known to be oncogenic
drivers in many cancers. Dysregulation of Myc proteins is estimated to drive 30% of all cancers, attributed to
inappropriate amplified Myc expression and dysregulated behaviors. c-Myc is prominent in a wide variety of
cancers, due to its broad expression patterns, where N-Myc and L-Myc are tissue specific and heavily associated
in neuroblastoma and small cell lung carcinoma, respectively. Due to its prevalent cancer involvement, Myc
family transcription factors are considered an attractive anti-cancer target, but their disordered nature makes
them poor drug targets. Protein-protein interactions of Myc with other regulatory partners creates an opportunity
for therapeutic intervention via indirect targeting, yet structural details of many Myc interactions remain unclear.
The N- and c-Myc binding partner Aurora Kinase A (AurA), a serine-threonine kinase, is hypothesized to stabilize
Myc by preventing proper ubiquitin-mediated degradation by the SCFFbxw7 ubiquitin ligase complex. In this pro-
posal, fluorescence anisotropy and time-resolved fluorescence will be utilized to fully assess binding of AurA at
varied phosphorylation states and lengths of c-Myc. To structurally characterize a c-Myc/AurA complex I will
pursue extensive training in X-ray crystallography alongside my experience using continuous-wave electron par-
amagnetic resonance (CW-EPR) spectroscopy to study the interface of this interaction, proposed within. My
preliminary work has supported the formation of an AurA/c-Myc/Fbxw7 complex, of which I will structurally char-
acterize using continued training in cryogenic-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Further characterization of c-Myc
stabilization and ubiquitination patterns by AurA using my developed in vitro ubiquitination assays will result in a
defined mechanism of AurA induced stabilization of c-Myc. The high conservation of regulatory protein binding
domains across Myc family transcription factors suggests a role of AurA stabilization of L-Myc, already identified
for N- and c-Myc. The work and training I receive studying the c-Myc/AurA interaction will build foundations for
my future independent research on defining an impact of AurA on L-Myc stabilization, a widely understudied Myc
family member. I will also use in cellular work to characterize the physiological protein interactions involved in L-
Myc regulation and dysregulation, including kinases and SCF ubiquitin ligase components, currently unidentified.
The extensive X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM training proposed within will add a strong structural biology
foundation to the independent research program I plan to develop at an R1 institution. The focus of my lab will
be rooted in characterizing the regulation mechanisms of disordered transcription factors in cancer and disease.
I believe the extensive structural biology and biophysical background from proposed training and extensive ex-
perience will make me a competitive candidate for a future tenure-track faculty role."

There is a compelling need to decipher the role of the dysregulation of translation elongation in various chronic
neurological conditions and various cancers. The long-term goal driving the proposed research is to help develop
therapeutic strategies targeting eEF2K for the clinical treatment of progressive neurodegenerative diseases and
malignancies. The overall objectives in this application are to (i) characterize the kinetic mechanism of eEF2K
activation, (ii) elucidate the structural basis for the activation and regulation of eEF2K, and (iii) determine a
unifying mechanism of the regulation of eEF2K activation and activity by divalent cations, pH, ADP, and post-
translational modifications, and (iv) quantify eEF2K-mediated signal transduction in mammalian cells. The central
hypothesis is that calmodulin (CaM) binding activates eEF2K by profoundly altering its conformational dynamics,
leading to a state capable of efficient phosphoryl transfer. Multiple regulatory inputs control the attainment of this
state. The rationale is that understanding the mechanism of eEF2K regulation is necessary to provide a robust
scientific framework for developing novel therapeutic approaches targeting neurodegenerative diseases and
cancer. The central hypothesis is tested through two specific aims: (1) to determine the mechanistic basis for
regulating eEF2K activation and the properties of the active state and (2) to delineate the regulatory influences
on eEF2K activation and activity by suppressive elements and post-translational modifications. In the first aim,
the precise allosteric mechanism of eEF2K activation will be defined through a combination of pre-steady state
kinetics, computational approaches, and structural analysis. The second aim will determine the modulatory
effects of specific post-translational modifications in affecting the CaM sensitivity of the active state. The findings
for both aims will be validated by characterizing eEF2K activation and activity in mammalian cells. In our opinion,
the research proposed in this application is innovative because it focuses on understanding the relationships
between the structural dynamics and the temporal control of eEF2K in mammalian cells using a unique
combination of techniques integrated over multiple length scales from the atomic to the cellular. The proposed
research is significant because it is expected to provide new insight into the cellular regulation of protein
translation by eEF2K and provide critical advancement in understanding various eEF2K-driven pathologies."

Ultradian oscillatory circuits are pervasive in biological systems. These dynamic oscillators range from pulsatile
p53 expression after -radiation, to periodic nuclear to cytoplasmic shuttling of NFkB transcription factor in
response to cytokine, to cyclic expression of Hes/Her transcription factors in stem cells and presomitic
mesoderm (PSM). Ultradian genetic oscillators are associated with patterning and developmental transitions –
oscillations correlate with yeast metabolic cycles, foreshadow periodic lateral root branching in Arabidopsis,
regulate molt cycles in larval worms, associate with stem cell pluripotency, and synchronize transcriptional
response to starvation signals in Dictostelium. One biological oscillator is the vertebrate segmentation clock,
which controls somitogenesis, the process by which the PSM is sequentially divided into segments called
somites. At the core of the segmentation clock is an auto-inhibitory negative feedback loop involving Her/Hes
transcriptional repressors, which in turn regulates oscillatory expression of additional ‘cyclic genes’. Although
the cyclic genes in human and mouse belong to similar pathways (e.g., Notch, Wnt, FGF, Yap/Hippo), genes in
those pathways which are cyclically expressed vary among species, with the Her/Hes gene family genes being
common among vertebrates. We study the zebrafish segmentation clock, which oscillates with a 30-minute
periodicity and is 4-12 times faster than in mouse or human. In order for a rapid auto-inhibitory oscillator to
operate, there must be tight control over synthesis and decay of cyclic gene transcript and protein. A recent
experiment in which the Hes7 locus was swapped between human and mouse in vitro PSM systems showed
that expression delays and decay, controlled by factors in the host cell environment, are critical regulatory
parameters of the clock. To understand the mechanisms regulating these critical parameters, we are using the
zebrafish pnrc2 mutant in which transcriptional oscillations occur normally, but post-transcriptional decay
mechanisms are disrupted, to identify additional cyclic genes and dissect their regulation. The specific aims of
the proposal are to (1) identify Pnrc2-regulated zebrafish embryonic cyclic genes that play critical
developmental roles, (2) characterize the regulatory features and factors that control rapid decay dynamics of
cyclic gene transcripts, and (3) investigate the role of other post-transcriptional mechanism in regulating
segmentation clock function. We anticipate that our work will broadly impact understanding of post-
transcriptional mechanisms regulating oscillatory expression in many developmental contexts."
11037408,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The majority of highly diverse biological processes are enabled through proteins, protein post-translational
modifications/proteoforms, protein interactions, PIs (e.g., protein-protein, PPIs, protein- ligand, PLIs), and
aberrations of abundances, activities, functions, and integrity of such interactions can lead to severe diseases,
including cancer. Furthermore, disruption of these protein-based characteristics by novel targeted therapies
can be an important biomarker for the response to these drugs in personalized medicine approaches. Clinical
and biological specimens are often available in limited amounts, which greatly hampers the progress in
diagnostics, therapy development, and biomedical research. Microbiopsy and liquid biopsies containing rare
cell populations such as circulating tumor cells, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and immune cells may
contain only low thousands or hundreds of cells and be heterogeneous. Traditional techniques to study
proteomic profiles, proteoforms, protein complexes, and PPIs (e.g., conventional proteomics, NMR, X-ray
crystallography, yeast two-hybrid screening and immunoaffinity purification (IP) followed by mass spectrometry
(MS)) cannot be readily used for the analysis of small cell populations, microscopic clinical samples and
individual cells mainly due to limitations in sensitivity. Therefore, many biological and clinically relevant studies
are not undertaken because of the lack of technology for such low level samples. Here, we propose to
develop analytical platforms that will enable high sensitivity analysis of scarce samples at the level of
digests, intact proteoforms, and native complexes. This task will demand the development of novel
approaches in sample preparation, ulra-low flow liquid phase separations interfaced with MS, MS data
acquisition, and data analysis. Developing such novel methods for thorough profiling of microscale samples
and integrating them in innovative “plug-and-play” automated platforms capable of efficient and high sensitivity
characterization of intact proteoforms, protein complexes and PTMs by MS will be highly desirable for gaining
biological insights into molecular mechanisms of the disease and discovery of therapeutic targets and
biomarkers for diagnostic and prognostic purposes. The developed platforms will be evaluated using well-
controlled model systems and applied in the most clinically relevant settings to examine (1) model systems for
cell differentiation and activation; (2) the interactome and biological role of STAT3, the transcription factor
which is aberrantly activated in the vast majority of ovarian cancer cell lines and primary samples; and (2)
MHC-associated neontigenic peptides."

SHANK3-deficient deficient stem cells and characterize their cellular composition (Aim 1) and functional

CRISPR-Cas loci provide bacteria with adaptive immunity against phages and plasmids. By
remembering and destroying foreign genetic elements, CRISPR-Cas systems also restrict
horizontal gene transfer, a frequent route for the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes
and toxins. To balance defense with genetic exchange, CRISPR-Cas systems likely undergo
spatiotemporal regulation; however, little is known about the ways in which CRISPR-Cas loci
interact with their bacterial hosts or changing environments.
My laboratory studies type II CRISPR-Cas systems, which encode the gene-editing tool cas9.
CRISPR-Cas9 systems are frequently found in human pathogens like S. pyogenes, and we are
focused on understanding how CRISPR-Cas9 activities are intertwined with and often defined
by the biology of their bacterial host cell. We recently discovered that S. pyogenes Cas9
performs a novel autoregulatory function. A non-canonical guide RNA repurposes Cas9 from a
nuclease into a transcriptional repressor that silences its own promoter. This finding helps
explain how CRISPR-Cas9 systems prevent autoimmunity against the bacterial chromosome,
but it remains unclear how CRISPR-Cas expression can be induced as needed, for instance
during or preceding a phage infection.
In this proposal, we explore two new directions in CRISPR-Cas biology. First, we investigate the
non-canonical regulatory roles of Cas9. Specifically, we characterize the conditions and
mechanisms that allow Cas9 to transiently relieve its repression and induce CRISPR-Cas
expression, and we ask whether Cas9 evolved to regulate other bacterial genes outside the
CRISPR-Cas locus. These studies will establish a new foundation for understanding the role of
Cas9 in the physiology of commensal and pathogenic bacteria. Furthermore, our studies on
non-canonical guide RNAs will lead to new strategies for the development of controllable Cas9
technologies and therapies. In our second project, we establish an innovative imaging platform
to observe live CRISPR-Cas immunization events for the first time. This project will illuminate a
fundamental unanswered question in CRISPR-Cas biology: why are new memories successfully
formed in only one in a million infected cells? The answers will provide new clues into the ways
in which heterogeneity within bacterial populations enables survival. Furthermore, these insights
and tools will be valuable for the development of phage therapies, which are offering promise in
combatting the growing threat of antibiotic-resistant pathogens."
11035327,"Age-related hearing loss (ARHL) is the predominant sensory disorder and neurodegenerative condition of our
aged population. Currently, it is difficult or impossible to diagnose the exact etiology of ARHL, or other types of
hearing loss in a particular patient clinically. This makes effective medical interventions for hearing loss quite
challenging now, and indeed, there are no FDA-approved medical treatments to prevent or treat sensorineural
hearing loss. The endocochlear potential (EP), also known as the “cochlear battery”, is the voltage difference
between the endolymph of scala media and the surrounding fluids of the other two cochlear scalae. The EP
results from the high K+ and low Na+ concentrations in the endolymph due to movement of K ions up a voltage
and concentration gradient by specialized cells of the stria vascularis of the cochlear lateral wall. This voltage
difference is critical for normal functioning of the inner ear, and good hearing. There are reports from animal
model studies demonstrating the significance of the EP for hearing, and how it declines in the aging cochlea,
with downstream effects on other cochlear pathologies as well. However, for human diagnoses, there is no
clinical method available for EP measurements. Post-mortem EP measurements in human cadavers, for
research purposes, are also not feasible, as mammals lose the EP immediately after they die. Currently, a
surgical approach for rodents – exposing the bulla and cochlea, and measuring the EP using a microelectrode,
is the gold standard for EP measurement in animal models. However, this approach cannot be utilized in
humans due to its invasive characteristics, causing both permanent loss of hearing and surrounding tissue
damage, while also being terminal in nature for rodents. This complication makes longitudinal human studies
impossible, thus, hindering the firm establishment of strial atrophy and EP reduction as a predominant clinical
risk factor in ARHL and other types of hearing impairment. Therefore, there is a compelling need to develop an
in vivo, wireless EP measurement technique that could be utilized for human subjects. The primary aim of this
project is to develop a dependable EP measurement methodology using current nuclear and molecular
imaging methods in which a dilute radiotracer can be used to characterize K+ activity within the inner ear. The
proposed research has a unique potential to revolutionize the diagnostic and treatment possibilities for hearing
loss clinically. We combine biomedical engineering and imaging, with hearing sciences, animal model
techniques and neuroengineering to achieve this translational breakthrough for hearing impaired persons."

(FORWARD) Program was first funded in 2018 and has successfully recruited and trained numerous senior
and near-peer mentors who have effectively guided early-stage professionals toward grant funding, academic
promotions, and leadership roles within AGA committees.
The current FORWARD Program enrolls and trains cohorts of 14 scholars over an 18-month training period.
However, since its inception, FORWARD has become a top-rated program for training for early-stage
underrepresented gastroenterologists with a proven track record of successful career outcomes among
program alumni. Thus, interest from the gastroenterology community has far exceeded the availability of
training slots, creating a new challenge for AGA in 2024.
Our proposed supplemental application, the Best of FORWARD immersion experience, is designed to
disseminate the most impactful aspects of the longitudinal FORWARD experience for a larger audience that
cannot be accommodated through the parent program. Similar to the parent program, our overall objective is
to overcome a primary impediment to diversifying the biomedical workforce -- accessible and effective
mentorship. We plan to accomplish our objective through four specific aims:
1) Enhance mentorship through access to race and ethnicity-concordant near-peer and senior mentors.
2) Broaden academic research skills.
3) Strengthen leadership skills with a focus on team science and lab management.
4) Establish a sustainable network of underrepresented physician-scientists and mentors through a digital
community within a mobile app."

 High performance computing (HPC) has become an indispensable resource for scientific research in diverse
fields including deep learning, bioinformatics, and molecular simulation. In the parent award (Grant No.:
1R16GM146633), Dr. Negin Forouzesh (PI) proposed to design, develop, and test a Physics-Guided Neural
Network (PGNN) model for improving the accuracy of protein-ligand binding free energy using implicit solvent
models. Recent results on more than 300 protein-ligand complexes demonstrate that the proposed PGNN model
can successfully improve the “accuracy” of the pure physics-based model. In addition, the “interpretability” and
“transferability” of the model have been boosted compared to the purely data-driven model. In this proposal, the
PI requests the purchase of a workstation to (1) run molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, (2) train deep learning
models, and (3) run a massively parallel implementation of an optimization algorithm. The requested storage is
for saving protein-ligand structures, MD trajectories, source codes, student theses, and manuscripts. The new
equipment will enable the student assistants to run HPC simulations efficiently and will improve the quality and
extent of research in the Biomolecular area at Cal State LA."
11036866,"High performance compute infrastructure has led to numerous breakthroughs and spurred increasing inclusion
of bioinformatics approaches by researchers. For many academic scientists, computation is accomplished with
local resources or those shared at partner institutes. Unfortunately, these systems become obsolete over time
and due to high demand may have long job queues. Thus, there is a relentless need to modernize and expand
computational resources. One potential solution is cloud computing where commercial systems for scalability.
To prepare a biomedical workforce for this paradigm shifting in data science, NIGMS launched training modules
in the NIGMS Sandbox for a variety of users to become competent in cloud computing. This proposal will expand
these offerings to provide new modules specifically targeted to the undergraduate classroom. Their inclusion will
expand the reach of NIGMS cloud training resources to very early career scientists and faculty who might not
otherwise engage in cloud computing. To serve diverse interests, the modules will be available for artificial
intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML), structural biology, and epidemiology research. The modules to be
developed with this supplement will include lightweight datasets for exploring code. This will lead to minor
compute time costs such that standard lab fees associated with a course will be sufficient to fund module
activities. All modules will be designed to fit within up to five standard 150 minute class periods, giving faculty
who adopt the curriculum the ability to include other topics in a semester. Thus, the modules can be worked into
a variety of courses."

Project Summary for R35 GM136321 (2020-2025)
Accurate protein biogenesis is essential for the generation and maintenance of a functional
proteome. Our long term goal is to understand the molecular mechanisms by which diverse
protein biogenesis pathways in the cell accurately select nascent protein substrates and ensure
their correct folding, localization, and maturation. Two major components define our research
program in this grant cycle. First, we will use a combination of biochemical, biophysical, and in
vivo experiments to decipher the mechanisms by which nascent proteins emerging from the
ribosome are selected and processed by ribosome-associated protein biogenesis factors
(RPBs) in the crowded space of the ribosome tunnel exit. These studies will include a new co-
translational membrane protein targeting pathway mediated by SecA, enzymes mediating N-
terminal methionine excision on nascent proteins in bacteria, and co-translational protein
targeting mediated by SRP in the mammalian system. In addition to studying the biochemical
and biophysical mechanisms of the individual protein biogenesis pathways, we will also
elucidate how each of these factors coordinates with other RPBs in space and time during
ongoing translation, and how this coordination reshapes the efficiency and fidelity of the
individual pathways. Second, we will decipher the mechanisms by which aggregation-prone
membrane proteins are effectively protected and facilely guided to the target membrane during
their post-translational targeting. These studies will use two membrane protein biogenesis
pathways as models: (i) an ATP-independent chaperone cpSRP43, which allows us to decipher,
at biophysical resolution, the molecular mechanisms by which a small chaperone effectively
protects multi-pass membrane protein clients and achieves spatiotemporal regulation of its
client interactions in the absence of ATPase cycles or cochaperones; (ii) the guided-entry of tail-
anchored proteins (GET) pathway, which provides an excellent system to decipher how a multi-
component Hsp70- cochaperone cascade protects, funnels, and triages nascent membrane
proteins during their targeted delivery. Investigation of the GET pathway will also allow us to
gain insights into the design and organizational principles of analogous chaperone networks in
the cell. The proposed experiments will not only generate high resolution understandings of the
individual protein biogenesis pathways, but also establish valuable tools, reagents to explore the
action of other protein biogenesis machineries. Most importantly, this research will generate
important conceptual frameworks to understand how nascent proteins are accurately selected
into their appropriate biogenesis pathways in the crowded cytosolic environment."
11036924,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Over the last several decades it has become apparent that carbon monoxide (CO) gas is an important small
molecule that greatly impacts human health. Indeed, CO is created endogenously in small concentrations and
has been shown to be an essential signaling molecule in the human neuronal system. Moreover, CO gas has
been revealed to be a valuable therapeutic, specifically, it can ameliorate acute and chronic inflammation, can
reduce rejection of organ transplants, and can treat cardiovascular diseases. However, the direct study or use
of CO in biological systems is inherently complex because it is a gas, has limited solubility in water, and is toxic
at high concentrations. As such, many of the mechanisms and pathways by which CO operates in the human
body remain elusive. In response to these complications, CO Releasing Molecules (CORMs) have emerged as
a class of materials that can release CO in response to an external stimulus. As transition metals readily ligate
to and release CO under various conditions, these materials were the first class of CORMs developed and remain
the most popular and frequently utilized to date. Unfortunately, CORMs based on transition metal carbonyl
complexes are cytotoxic, form poorly defined products following release of CO, and cannot be directly
polymerized to form macromolecular targeted therapeutics. Research in the Worrell laboratory is inspired by the
shortcomings in current CORM technology, and we are actively engaged in creating stable, modular, and efficient
organic CO releasing molecules. Our work has been concentrated on analogs of diphenylcyclopropenone
(DPCP), a uniquely stable and bio-orthogonal molecule that features a highly strained 3 membered ring. Previous
work in a small molecule setting has shown that DPCP is unrivaled in its ability to cleanly and efficiently produce
CO gas. Proof-of-concept demonstrations have shown that analogs of DPCP can be effectively synthesized, can
be directly polymerized, and can release CO gas by photolysis, however, for application as a CORM, this must
be demonstrated in a biological system. Future work over the five-year course of this program will concentrate
on the development of methods for the controlled polymerization of DPCP to create tailored macromolecular
materials that are soluble, targeted, non-toxic, and biocompatible. We will further concentrate on improving the
rate and efficacy of CO release by leveraging the unique photophysics of DPCPs while creating well-defined
photoproducts. Ultimately, the most impactful extension of this work will be related to its development in studying
and treating gastrointestinal inflammation as part of a long-term collaboration with the Colgan/Onyiah group at
the University of Colorado Medical School. Although there are significant challenges associated with this
program, its scientific impacts will be far-reaching. If successful, organic CORMs will supersede those based on
transition metal complexes, stimulating the development of new targeted therapeutics based on the production
of CO gas."
11035621,"Title: Coordination of molecular motor activity in intracellular transport and assembly of cytoskeletal
architecture.
P.I. – Richard J. McKenney
Research Summary
Intracellular transport is essential for cellular homeostasis in eukaryotes. Much of this process is
carried out by molecular motors that convert the chemical energy from ATP hydrolysis into motion
along the actin and microtubule cytoskeletal networks. Decades of research has uncovered structural
and molecular details that explain how many of these motors move along their filament tracks in
isolation. In the cellular milieu, most of these motors act in concert with complex regulatory machinery
that links them to their respective cargos, modulates their motile properties, and dictates
spatiotemporal activity. How individual motor output is controlled by this machinery is currently not
clear and difficult to dissect in the complex environment of the cell. In addition, many cargos are
moved simultaneously by motors of opposite polarity, in a process called bidirectional transport. How
individual motors are recruited to cargo, activated, and integrated with other classes of motors
presents a large challenge to the field. Further, the activities of disparate motors are harnessed to
build and maintain critical cytoskeletal structures such as the mitotic spindle, cilium, and cleavage
furrow. How motor and regulatory activities are coordinated to drive the self-assembly of such
structures is currently a significant barrier to understanding normal and diseased cellular physiology.
This application seeks to develop novel assays and tools to study the complexity of motor recruitment
and regulation, bidirectional transport of cargos, and the self-assembly of cytoskeletal structures
driven by motors and associated molecules. Our approach to combine biochemistry and single-
molecule analysis towards in vitro reconstitutions that test molecular function, and translate our
findings into in vivo systems that test hypotheses generated by these reconstitutions, will open up
fruitful long-term avenues of research. We propose to: 1) Reconstitute and study the recruitment,
regulation, and motility of cytoplasmic dynein and kinesin motors bound to membranous cargo
through the endogenous Rab GTPase machinery that is known to link these motors to endocytic
vesicles and mitochondria in cells, and 2) Reconstitute and study functions of dynein and kinesin
motors that drive the self-assembly of the mitotic spindle. These broad goals build and expand on our
expertise and previous work in dissecting the regulatory mechanisms of the cytoplasmic dynein motor,
and aim to provide powerful new tools useful towards dissecting complex motor function. Our work
will illuminate basic molecular and cell biological principles that drive cellular homeostasis and
provide insight into the pathological mechanisms that arise from molecular motor malfunction."
11035672,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Human chromosomes serve to compact the genomic DNA several thousand times its length to fit within the
cell’s nucleus, while also allowing for processes such as and gene expression. To accomplish this, the
genome is assembled into a complicated, multifaceted complex known as chromatin. The assembly of
chromatin first involves wrapping short (~200 bp) segments around spools of protein comprised of core
histone into structures known as nucleosomes. Immensely long, genome-sized strings of nucleosomes are
assembled into large structures via to the self-interacting nature of nucleosomes. The key elements in
formation of these large condensed structures are the ‘tail’ domains of the core histone proteins, which
protrude out from the main body of nucleosomes to mediate inter-nucleosome interactions. However,
despite their essential nature to the formation of chromosomes, little is actually known about how the
histone tail domains contact neighboring nucleosomes. Moreover, these interactions represent critical
points for regulation, and are modified by epigenetic posttranslational modifications, including acetylation,
as well as other chromatin modifiers. This project will employ biochemical and biophysical techniques to
define critical molecular aspects of the inter-nucleosome interactions mediated by the core histone tail
domains in model systems, and elucidate how epigenetic modifications within the tail domains regulate
these interactions. The specific goals of the work described in this proposal are to: 1) define inter-
nucleosome interactions mediated by the core histone tail domains, and how posttranslational
modifications transition inactive chromatin structures to those hospitable to active genes in a model
chromatin system; 2) define aspects of how linker histones bind to nucleosomes, and oligonucleosome
arrays, are affected by posttranslational modifications, and communicate the core histone tail domains; and
3) understand how the HMGN chromatin architectural factors influence H1 structure to destabilize
chromatin condensates In addition, we will use lessons learned from the above work to understand the
molecular basis a newly identified mutation in a linker histone that causes the genetic disorder known as
Rahman’s disease. These results will fill in key knowledge gaps in our understanding of how
chromosomes are assembled, and regulated to provide for transcription, replication, DNA repair, and other
genome-related processes."
11036627,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Compared to non-Latinx White individuals, Latinx individuals (gender-inclusive term; includes Hispanics,
Latino/a/e) have 2-times the risk of kidney failure and face a disproportionate burden of structural racism and
kidney health disparities. Latinx individuals are less likely to receive pre-dialysis nephrology care compared to
non-Latinx White individuals and as a result, are less likely to initiate person-centered kidney replacement
therapy (KRT), such as kidney transplantation or home dialysis. Latinx individuals are instead more likely than
non-Latinx White individuals to begin KRT with a central venous catheter, which has a higher risk of mortality
(1.4-1.5-fold) and fatal infection (1.5-2-fold) compared to an arteriovenous fistula or graft. Our community-
partnered research team developed and tested NAVIGATE-Kidney, a multi-level, language and culturally
concordant community health worker (CHW) intervention for Latinx individuals with kidney failure who receive
maintenance hemodialysis. Our funded parent grant (U01 DK137272-01) allows us to move beyond dialysis
center interventions by providing support to Latinx individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 4/5.
Our team will conduct a patient-level randomized controlled trial of NAVIGATE-Kidney that will be implemented
across socioecological levels (individual, interpersonal, community, and societal) to mitigate structural racism.
We hypothesize that our NAVIGATE-Kidney intervention will reduce the composite primary endpoint, defined
as time to transition to KRT and central venous catheter use or death. In our plan for enhancing diverse
perspectives (PEDP), our team proposed mentorship of diverse nephrology physician scientists, trainees, and
CHWs as well as development of a kidney disease CHW training program. The PI, Dr. Lilia Cervantes, is a
nationally renowned leader in Latinx kidney disease health disparities research, who provides one to one
mentorship to nephrology scientists whose research and goals to eliminate structural racism align with her
own. This supplement will provide Dr. Cervantes with the protected time to provide mentorship to mentees on
how to conduct community-partnered research, grant writing, publications, technical skills development
including dissemination and implementation activities, and opportunities for networking. We also propose to
utilize supplement funds to support the team that will build the kidney disease CHW training program. This
training program will provide CHWs with the disease specific training for principal illness navigation certification
(required by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for reimbursement) and in doing so, will increase
diversity in kidney disease clinical trials, CHW intervention research, and the CHW research workforce. The
work proposed in this supplement aligns seamlessly with our parent grant PEDP, expands the research
proposed in our parent grant and the structural racism parent grant consortium, and will directly increase
diversity in the research workforce focused on kidney health disparities research."
11037615,"PROJECT SUMMARY - R35 PARENT GRANT
The microbiota of the mammalian gut is a complex community of individual strains shaped in part by microbial
competition over diet components. Despite computational analyses predicting enzymatic capacity of diverse
bacteria, this knowledge is not sufficient to determine how diet influences bacterial abundance in the gut. In
particular, little is known about regulation of carbon utilization enzymes in gut bacteria. Do they have
mechanisms similar to E. coli carbon catabolite repression to consume preferred nutrients sequentially? Or do
they consume all available nutrients simultaneously? How do these different strategies contribute to microbial
abundance in the gut? We have identified a mechanism resembling carbon catabolite repression in Collinsella
aerofaciens that may be a disadvantage when there is an abundance of secondary carbon source in the gut.
Our laboratory seeks to characterize regulatory mechanisms governing carbon consumption in Collinsella
species, in culture and in the mouse gut. Collinsella species are poorly studied Actinobacteria that are linked to
chronic human diseases including type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis. We have studied a group of closely
related species and strains that vary in their regulation of carbon consumption. We will use this existing
variability and experimental evolution to identify a common pathway of carbon catabolite repression in these
bacteria. We will measure the heterogeneity of this pathway and related metabolic functions using single-cell
RNA-seq. Finally, we will characterize the impact of this regulation on bacterial growth and competition in the
mouse gut.
Together, this research will define regulatory pathways that contribute to advantageous strategies in the
complex nutrient environment of the mammalian intestine. Despite the vast number of correlative studies
implicating a role for the gut microbiome in human disease, there remains much to explore in identifying
bacterial metabolic pathways governing bacterial abundance and function in the gut. This gap limits both our
understanding of the basic biology of these community interactions as well as the ability to design effective
microbial therapeutics for human diseases characterized by complex microbial dysbiosis."

Over the past 50 years, the field of biophysical chemistry has learned an enormous amount about the
relationships between the function, dynamics and folding of soluble proteins. The next stage in biological science
involves addressing more complex problems on more challenging systems using increasingly sophisticated
approaches augmented by computational methods. The Sosnick lab has followed this path. We are conducting
studies of membrane proteins, condensates and disordered proteins. Our ability to address these topics arises
in part from our expertise in the folding of soluble and more recently, membrane proteins. We build on this
experience and knowledge to advance new or improve existing methods. The proposed research relies heavily
on hydrogen exchange (HX), a method developed to study folding and dynamics yet possessing broad
transferability to many methods. We plan to continue this approach and study the voltage activation of a sensory
motor protein, metabolite transport across a bilayer, stress-induced phase separation, and properties of
disordered proteins in addition to membrane protein folding. To address these topics in depth, we are expanding
HX's applicability to membrane proteins under an activating voltage, during their folding, and even in vivo to
examine their dynamics in cells. These studies are augmented by simulations conducted with our Upside
algorithm that is 103-104 fold faster than ordinary simulations. This speed enables Upside to produce HX patterns
that can be compared to experiment. Many of the projects are collaborative, leveraging our skills and interests
with those of other labs, which further supports the value of our studies."

The evolutionarily conserved Wnt pathway plays a critical role during metazoan development

humans. Using biochemical methods, my lab has made breakthroughs in our fundamental
understanding of Wnt signaling, including the development of the first biochemical system to

The Lee Lab utilizes a high-speed floor centrifuge for preparing plasmid DNA (for transfection

department has two similar centrifuges, but one is broken (and likely will not be fixed due to its
old age); the other centrifuge is heavily used and is in another building (requiring several flights
of stairs). Thus, we are requesting funds to purchase a new Beckman Coulter Avanti-JXN30

us to perform sucrose density gradient centrifugation to monitor Wnt receptor activation, a

11035927,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Bacteria have a remarkable ability to sense diverse stimuli and make regulatory decisions to
elicit an appropriate response. The objective of our research program is to understand the
molecular underpinnings of this cellular decision-making process during the development of
three dimensional (3D) structured communities called biofilms. Biofilms represent a predominant
bacterial lifestyle and are crucial for antimicrobial tolerance, virulence, and environmental
persistence in diverse pathogens including multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. P.
aeruginosa serves as an ideal clinically relevant model system for our basic research in biofilms
because it adapts to and forms biofilms in a wide variety of environments, and the biofilm matrix
components in this organism are well characterized. The overarching goal of the proposed
research is to define how bacteria decode and integrate sensory cues – physical, chemical and
biological – over the course of the biofilm development cycle. My work has shown that light
(physical cue) detected via bacteriophytochrome BphP photoreceptor mediated photo sensing
and population density (biological cue) detected via RhlR mediated quorum sensing represses
biofilms. Furthermore, we have discovered that nutrient availability (chemical cue) converges
with quorum sensing (biological cue) to control biofilm matrix components and architecture.
Over the next five years, we will build on our recent discoveries and use a multidisciplinary
approach combining bacterial genetics, molecular biology, biochemistry, fluorescence
microscopy, mathematical modeling, structural biology and genome-scale studies to define
sensory signaling in the context of a growing biofilm. First, we will investigate how light is
perceived locally and globally in heterogenous biofilms and characterize the BphP photo-
sensing signaling system to understand the regulation of photo sensing in P. aeruginosa
(Project 1). Second, we will dissect the CbrA-Crc nutrient-sensing pathway to learn how nutrient
availability controls biofilm development (Project 2). Third, we will delineate the different ways by
which RhlR mediated quorum sensing represses biofilm formation (Project 3). Finally, we will
define how information from two or more distinct sensory signaling pathways are combined in
the control of collective behaviors (Project 4). Our research will establish a broadly relevant
framework for understanding how information encoded in diverse sensory inputs is extracted
and integrated to drive collective behaviors – knowledge that is crucial for designing successful
synthetic strategies to enhance or to inhibit biofilms and for developing novel therapeutic
interventions."
11035928,"Stark, Ruth E. Molecular Drivers of FABP-mediated Endocannabinoid Signaling for Appetite Regulation
[unchanged from original proposal submission]
 Metabolic signaling by endogenous cannabinoids (ECs) is essential to the regulation of human
appetite, pain, and neuroprotection. Fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) can either sequester the
hydrophobic ECs or transport them to hydrolytic enzymes; ECs routed to the nucleus also activate the
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). EC levels have been correlated with obesity in
knockout mice for liver (L) FABP that is co-expressed with intestinal (I) FABP in enterocytes and also for
PPARa knockouts, underscoring the regulatory roles of these proteins. We will probe poorly understood
EC-FABP, EC-PPAR, and FABP-EC-PPAR complexes in vitro at near-physiological concentrations,
determining affinities, metabolic fates, molecular binding interfaces, and conformational changes to test
mechanistic hypotheses regarding EC signaling. Trainees at multiple career stages, including those
recruited from underrepresented groups in STEM, will be integrally involved in this research program.
 Specific questions to be addressed are as follows: (1) How do ECs choose between FABP
chaperones to produce obese or lean outcomes? The possibility that ECs are delivered by LFABP to
hydrolytic enzymes for metabolic breakdown rather than sequestered by IFABP in the enterocyte will be
tested enzymatically, whereas the rationale for LFABP’s diminished affinity will be explored using high-
pressure solution-state NMR to identify energetically favored candidate sites for binding. (2) Could
transcriptional activity be driven by EC binding preferences for LFABP vs. PPARa? The PPARa
ligand-binding domain (PPARa_LBD) will be purified, rigorously delipidated, and tested in vitro for EC-
modulated transcriptional activity. EC binding affinities will be compared for PPARa_LBD and FABPs.
(3) Could transcriptional activity be driven by EC-modulated FABP-PPAR collisions that cause
conformational changes? To determine the interactions involved in the proposed FABP-mediated EC
activation of PPARa transcriptional function, we will first use surface plasmon resonance to measure the
binding affinity of LFABP-PPARa_LBD protein complexes, on their own and in the presence of ligands
with a range of known activation efficacies. The site-specific collision-associated impact on the LFABP
partner will be probed by solution-state NMR spectroscopy of the [U-15N]-enriched protein, using chemical
shift perturbations of each backbone NH resonance to define the binding interface with PPARa_LBD, any
allosteric structural changes that occur upon complex formation, and their modulation by EC ligands. Taken
together, these experiments will advance our understanding of (macro)molecular networks that function to
achieve metabolic signaling by ECs involved in appetite and pain regulation, thereby advancing our
understanding of health risks related to obesity and inflammation. This understanding can guide the design
of drugs that modulate these biomedically important ligand-protein and protein-protein interactions.

11037592,"Abstract
Multiple human psychiatric disorders are associated with unusual social behaviors related to aggression,
anxiety, and affiliation. Although the genetic component of these disorders is well established, their inheritance
is complex and identification of the causative genes is often extremely difficult. The growth of phenotypic and
genetic information, however, revealed that unusual behaviors observed in these disorders often represent the
extreme ends of behavioral variation observed in the general population, suggesting that genes implicated in
social behavior in unaffected population also influence disorder risk and symptom severity. To identify the
genes and pathways disturbed in psychiatric disorders, an understanding of the molecular basis of mammalian
social behavior would provide a crucial step forward.
The goals of this project are to resolve differences in affiliation, aggression, and anxiety-like behaviors
segregating in the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) with the intent of providing valuable insights into the mechanisms
underlying a broad range of mammalian social behaviors, including human psychiatric disorders. The
behavioral differences between artificially selected fox populations have significant parallels to behaviors
modified in human neurological disorders. These populations are well prepared for genetic, molecular, and
cellular studies of social behavior and represent a unique, novel, and significant large animal model. The
identification of molecular mechanisms influencing social behavior in foxes is expected to provide new insights
into human disorders of social behavior and facilitate integration of human and rodent studies, thereby leading
to the development of potential therapies."

In this application, we examine the molecular mechanisms that instruct neural wiring and axon terminal
elaboration. We focus on the Drosophila neuromuscular system due to its invariant connectivity, limited
synaptic partners, and accessibility. Given that this ‘simple’ circuit has been studied for over four decades, it is
somewhat surprising that fundamental questions still exist as to how motor neurons choose their appropriate
muscle targets and how each motor neuron develops a unique, yet stereotyped, axon terminal structure that
underlies synaptic function. Conceptually, both of these developmental processes rely on specificity cues to
guide synaptic partner matching (role 1) and synaptic elaboration at each axon terminal (role 2). In support of
the first role, we previously discovered two interacting cell surface proteins (CSPs), DIP-α and Dpr10, that are
required for wiring a motor neuron to a subset of muscles. In support of the second role, these CSPs continue
to be expressed after connectivity, implying additional functions in synaptic development. Our central
hypothesis is that combinatorial Dpr-DIP interactions, in addition to specifying synaptic connections, also
participate in determining the structure and function of specified synapses. Insights into circuit development
arose in a prior collaboration where we characterized the ‘Dpr-ome’, the set of interactions between two
families of the immunoglobulin superfamily, the Dprs and DIPs. These 32 proteins bind to one another in
unique combinations, and our preliminary data reveal unique expression patterns in the Drosophila larval
neuromuscular circuit. Additionally, our data support a combinatorial Dpr-DIP interaction model that leverages
cis/trans interactions to instruct highly specific synaptic partnerships. We also reveal a novel signaling pathway
that underlies local synaptic elaboration. Given our findings and genetic reagents, we are in a unique position
not only to compare axon branch-specific identification tags but also to ask if synaptic elaboration of
neighboring axon terminals can be independently regulated. In the first aim, we capitalize on the Dpr-ome and
the expression of 6 DIPs in multi-innervating motor neurons to perform single-cell genetic manipulations and
examine how combinatorial Dpr-DIP codes instruct connectivity. In addition, we generate affinity variants to
reveal a coordinated cis/trans interaction model that enhances specificity. In the second aim, we utilize
functional and genetic approaches to understand how co-innervating inputs develop unique morphological and
functional properties. We identify a novel crosstalk signaling pathway between axon arbors that locally sculpts
NMJ size. Overall, these studies will uncover fundamental developmental programs required for neural circuit
wiring and axon terminal elaboration, with emphasis on how CSP codes modulate each of these processes."

This supplement aims to acquire a Dell high-performance computing (HPC) server with 8 NVIDIA H100
Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to supercharge foundational deep learning method development for
scalable and accurate prediction of protein structures, paving the way to genomic-scale computational protein
modeling regardless of evolutionary relationships with previously annotated proteins. Artificial intelligence-
powered methods have led to a paradigm-shift in computational modeling of protein structures, yet even the
most successful approaches for protein structure prediction fail to accurately predict structures of large multi-
domain proteins with complex topologies or proteins with short sequences; and heavily depend on the
availability of evolutionary information that are not always abundant such as with orphan proteins or rapidly
evolving proteins. Work on structure prediction that uses single or few homologous sequences remains
inaccurate and/or inefficient, limiting scaling to genomic protein databases. Latest advances in artificial
intelligence such as foundational deep learning models hold the key to address the limitations. The parent R35
grant of this supplement aims to develop cutting-edge deep learning models to automate genomic-scale
protein structure modeling with the key tasks of: (1) accurate de novo modeling of protein structures beyond
evolutionary relatedness, even with single-sequence input; (2) high-fidelity identification of remotely
homologous proteins despite low sequence similarly to previously annotated proteins; and (3) atomistic
refinement of predicted protein structures to drive them towards experimental resolutions terms of
stereochemical qualities and side-chain positioning. Our substantial progress in the first three years of the
project has demonstrated the feasibility and promise of our approach. However, training and testing
foundational deep learning models leveraging the transformer neural network architectures on evolutionary-
scale molecular data require a large amount of GPU computing power. Using the current GPU resource
available to us, it takes six months for a developer to complete the training and testing of one deep learning
method end to end. While such a speed can yield steady progress, it is not fast enough to unleash the power
of these advanced deep learning methods and realize the full potential and impact of the parent R35 project.
This supplement will enable us to acquire a high-performance computing server consisting of 8 NVIDIA H100
80GB GPUs to significantly speed up the research in the parent R35 project. The requested GPUs can

Most antibiotics are ineffective for killing dormant bacteria and it is estimated that 50% of antibiotic
tolerance cases are due to phenotypic ‘persistence’ rather than genetic resistance: bacteria can
survive drug treatment simply because a few of them are metabolically dormant. For example,
nutrient and oxygen depletion in the center of biofilms renders bacteria metabolically dormant and
antibiotic tolerant. Once the antibiotic is withdrawn, recurrence gives bacteria the chance to evolve
antibiotic resistance. Common examples of recurrent infections include urinary tract infections of
pathogenic E. coli—the most common bacterial infection in women in developed countries—latent
tuberculosis, and biofilm-forming bacteria, like the P. aeruginosa infections that often complicate
wound healing and commonly affect cystic fibrosis patients. To develop new strategies to combat
recurring infections and persistence, we need a better understanding of dormant bacteria.
My laboratory aims to identify new antibiotic targets that are effective against dormant bacteria. By
studying spontaneous death rates of dormant bacteria, we have already identified key vulnerabilities.
We found that death rates of dormant bacteria critically depend on previous growth conditions. By
correlating proteomics data with death rates, we have identified hundreds of genes that may
contribute to survival and adaptation processes of dormant bacteria. We have validated many of our
candidates using genetics, and discovered a crucial role of the bacterial outer membrane for the
survival of dormant bacteria. We now need to uncover how the outer membrane mechanistically
contributes to survival during dormancy and understand a complex interplay between the cell
envelope, osmoregulation and energy metabolism that we have discovered. A better understanding of
these processes will reveal the most promising antibiotic targets and effective combinations of
existing drugs against dormant bacteria. My lab's interdisciplinary experience in quantitative biology
and biophysics puts us in a unique position to answer these questions and to provide key insights into
the physiology of dormant states."

11037473,"Project Summary/Abstract
Dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ) disruptors are cutaneous poisons that cause the epidermis to detach from the dermis, an
effect that results in skin blistering (vesication). The prototype DEJ disruptor is mechlorethamine (MEC), a nitrogen
mustard; however, the toxicodynamic mechanisms involved in vesication by MEC and other DEJ disruptors remains
mostly undescribed in the scientific literature. The overall goal of the work proposed here is to investigate the
toxicodynamic mechanisms associated with DEJ disruption. This will be achieved by studying the role of mast cell
derived mediators (histamine and the serine protease tryptase), neutrophil-derived mediators (myeloperoxidase, MPO and
matrix metalloproteinase-9, MMP-9) and keratinocyte-specific collagens (collagen IV, COL4 and collagen XVII, COL17)
in the response of skin to MEC. In Aim 1 of the proposal, the hypothesis that mast cell-derived mediators influence DEJ
disruption will be evaluated. To this end, mouse ear skin will be topically exposed to saline (naïve), dimethylsulfoxide
(DMSO, vehicle) or MEC. Additional groups of mice will be treated 20 min prior to exposure to saline, vehicle or MEC
with the antihistamine doxepin (5% cream administered topically) or the tryptase inhibitor leupeptin (at test doses of 10 or
30 mg/kg, ip). All ear tissues will be harvested at 2, 8 or 24 hr and either fixed for histopathologic analysis or
homogenized and assayed for the presence of histamine via ELISA and tryptase via western blotting. In Aim 2 of the
proposal, we will test the hypothesis that neutrophil-derived MMP-9 contributes to DEJ disruption by MEC. To test this
hypothesis, we will analyze naïve, vehicle and MEC-treated mouse ear biopsies from wildtype and Mmp9 -/- knockout
mice obtained at 2, 8 or 24 hr after exposure for the presence of DEJ disruption using light microscopy and for the
presence of myeloperoxidase, a neutrophil-selective marker, using immunohistochemistry (IHC). In Aim 3 of the
proposal, we will test the hypothesis that MEC promotes blistering by interfering at the level of epidermal keratinocytes
and affecting the expression of key keratinocyte-expressed collagens involved in maintaining the DEJ, namely COL4 and
COL17. To test this hypothesis, we will analyze mouse ear biopsies from the time points and samples described above for
Aim 1 but here carry out IHC on the formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissues to evaluate how the expression of these two
proteins, COL4 and COL17, changes over time after following exposure to MEC. In addition, experiments in Aim 3 will
utilize human 3D skin cultures exposed to MEC for 2, 8 or 24 hr to investigate effects on COL4 and COL17 protein
expression in human tissues. All in all, the proposal seeks to investigate three related yet independent hypotheses that will
shed new light on the toxicodynamic mechanisms used by DEJ disruptors to cause blisters and will uncover novel targets
for the purpose of reducing chemically induced cutaneous blistering. The work proposed here will provide a broad,
“whole tissue” toxicodynamic response to injury by MEC at the levels of the cutaneous mast cells, the infiltrating
neutrophils and the epidermal keratinocytes and will be complemented by the 3D human skin study. Most importantly,
students involved in this project will learn a wide range of skills including experimental design, animal care, animal
dosing, histology techniques, IHC, western blotting and how to use ImageJ software to assess tissue protein expression."

11033435,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Childhood obesity is a rapidly expanding concern, with disproportionate impacts on Latino and Black children.
Across the life course, the gut microbiome has been associated with obesity risk. In children, events like cesarean
section and antibiotic exposure, which alter patterns of vertical microbiome transmission, have been associated
with increased obesity risk. The maternal gut microbiome is remodeled during pregnancy and altered by pre-
pregnancy BMI, impacting the microbes available in the maternal gut microbiome to be vertically transmitted to
the infant. Therefore, Dr. Holzhausen proposes to examine the impact of maternal weight status and preterm
birth on vertical microbiome transmission patterns and childhood overweight and obesity. Dr. Holzhausen will
build upon existing microbiome, metabolome, and phenotype data from two ongoing, longitudinal studies: the
Latino Mother’s Milk Study (L-MMS) and the Atlanta African American Mother Child cohort (AA-MC). In the L-
MMS, Dr. Holzhausen will explore the relationships between maternal weight status, strain-level vertical
transmission of gut microbes, function of the child gut microbiome, and overweight/obesity outcomes in 198
children. Dr. Holzhausen will also perform integrated multi-omics analysis to identify latent subgroups of children
at increased risk for childhood obesity. The AA-MC will serve as a replication cohort to contextualize the
generalizability of initial findings and will further extend the analysis to assess whether vertical transmission
patterns differ by pre- versus non-preterm birth. Through her training, Dr. Holzhausen will advance her
knowledge of techniques to analyze vertical microbiome transmission; gain expertise in metagenomic
sequencing and functional pathway analysis of the gut microbiome; gain experience in techniques for integrating
multi-omics data; and develop an understanding of the socio-cultural aspects of obesity. To gain these skills,
she will complete a multi-faceted training plan incorporating didactic instruction, seminars, extensive hands-on
training, and guidance from a diverse advisory committee of respected researchers. This training will
complement her expertise in 16S rRNA microbiome analysis and bioinformatics, ensuring the successful
establishment of her independent research career. Findings from these studies will improve our understanding
of the role of vertical microbiome transmission in the assembly of the infant gut microbiome and its relationship
with childhood obesity. Because the gut microbiome is a highly plastic metabolic feature, this work has the
potential to lead to the identification of therapeutic targets to prevent childhood obesity. With the proposed study,
Dr. Holzhausen is well positioned to take advantage of existing resources to develop independent,
complementary projects, designed to fill critical gaps in our understanding of the impacts of maternal weight
status and vertical microbiome transmission on the infant gut microbiome that may have far-reaching public
health implications for obesity prevention."

The proposed Center on Probes for Molecular Mechanotechnology (CPMM) will work to develop and optimize
technologies to enable the study of mechanobiology and mechanotransduction pathways in living cells. The
CPMM includes three highly synergistic Technology Development Projects (TDPs) that will be led by Alexa
Mattheyses, Khalid Salaita, and Yonggang Ke who have a strong track record of jointly publishing and working
together to developed tension probe technologies. In TDP#1: High resolution probes for mechanobiology, we
will create “indestructible” probes that can push the limits of spatial and orientation resolution for the DNA tension
probe technology. Tension-PAINT imaging will be refined to achieve realtime 20 nm spatial mapping of forces
and to combine this with immunostaining to map the proteins that assemble within proximity to mechanically
active receptors. Force orientation will be mapped using fluorescence polarization methods with turn-key
commercial microscopes. In TDP#2: Probes for mechanical tagging, we will develop methods of force-induced
tagging. The central design feature is a DNA probe that mediates a binding event or dissociation event at
threshold levels of force. Cells are tagged based on the magnitude and frequency of mechanical events
generated by a cell surface receptors. This TDP will lead to high-throughput analysis of cells using flow cytometry
and will also allow for proteomic analysis to open the door to “mechanomics”. Under TDP#3: Amplified force
sensors, the central technology here is responsive DNA structures that amplify mechanical inputs. The CPMM
has nine associated inaugural Driving Biomedical Projects (DBPs) led by a team of geographically diverse
collaborators. DBPs #1-#4 are focused on mechanobiology of T cells and use CPMM tools to test the
mechanosensor function of the T cell receptor (TCR) and the adhesion receptor LFA-1. DBP#5 focuses on the
heterogeneity in cancer cells. DBP#6 and #7 target the mechanosensor responses of platelets. Finally, DBP#8
and #9 address fundamental questions of the role of mechanics in focal adhesions. Our prototype TDP
technologies provide methods to measure molecular forces with the same ease and simplicity as that of
immunostaining, flow cytometry, PCR and ELISA. But unlike these mainstream techniques, mechano-imaging,
mechano-PCR, mechano-flow, and mechano-ELISA are not commercialized. Hence, the reagents and surface
preparation protocols and data analysis routines have to be custom prepared by the end user. This can be
challenging to the non-expert and is not routine. Therefore, the CPMM will integrate a strong Community
Engagement (CE) component. CE activities will focus on hands-on training workshops, publication of methods
articles, virtual seminar series, industry engagement, a strong web presence and engagement with three key
mechanobiology conferences that will help accelerate adoption of the tension probe technology. These CE
activities will ultimately lead to commercialization which will enable wide spread dissemination across the various
cell biology communities."
11037689,"Exposure to pesticides, fungicides and herbicides is linked to neuronal injury, neuronal loss and the onset and progress of
neurodegeneration. The parent grant explores whether a novel class of carbon nano materials, viz. carbon quantum dots
(CQDs), can restore cellular homeostasis and prevent behavioral deficits in organisms under pesticide exposure. Preliminary
data from our lab has revealed that organo-acid-derived CQDs can interfere in amyloid aggregation and mitigate ROS-stress
in cells. These CQDs were also uptaken by both model cell lines and nematodes and protected them from aberrant cellular
and behavioral outcomes upon paraquat exposure. We hypothesize that CQDs ameliorate environmental toxicant-
associated neuronal corruption. The present study aims to advance our knowledge of the potential mechanism(s) by which
CQDs may intervene against xenobiotic insult-associated neurotoxicity in vitro and in vivo (i.e., in dopaminergic cell lines
and organismal models (Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans)). The study entails the use of confocal microscopy to achieve
the objectives outlined below. We propose to image the fluorescent CQDs in vitro and in vivo to determine their
bioavailability, subcellular distribution and localization within SHSY-5Y cells and in the C. elegans nervous system. In
combination with GFP-tagged α-synuclein expressing cells and transgenic worms (that express neurons and amyloid-
forming proteins tagged with different colors), we can easily observe and identify where CQDs localize and their mechanism
of action when the cell (and worm) is exposed to xenobiotic-insult. Examples include the prevention of amyloid-protein
aggregation, reduction in the levels of free radicals and prevention of neuronal ablation. Furthermore, the use of confocal
microscopy will allow us to examine neurotoxicity, including neuronal development, neuronal absence or shrinkage,
absence of cell bodies, and reduction in the fluorescence intensity and the effect of CQDs to overcome this toxicity. In
conclusion, this study will use confocal imaging to examine the nanoscale behavior of cell lines, neurons and molecules
within live tissue when using CQDs against a toxicant. We will obtain profound insights into the physiological role of CQDs
in cell lines and organisms (C. elegans) which, in turn, will pave the way for their testing in vertebrate models of
environmental toxicant-associated neurodegenerative outcomes."
11037696,"Abstract of Funded Project
Novelty and surprise have long been known to facilitate learning and memory. At a functional level this
makes sense; unexpected events have to be learned about so they can be predicted and responded to
appropriately in the future. At a psychological level, surprising events have been shown to enhance
memory because they induce rehearsal. Subjects tend to “think about” unexpected events more than
familiar ones after they occur. This has been observed directly in humans (explicit rehearsal) and
indirectly in animals (implicit rehearsal). In both cases, the memory enhancement can be eliminated by
disrupting rehearsal with a distractor stimulus that is presented immediately after the novel event.
Presenting the same distractor stimulus several minutes later has no eGect. This suggests rehearsal is
short-lasting and distinct from the process of memory consolidation, which stabilizes new information
for several hours after learning. In addition to increasing rehearsal, novel events also trigger the release of
norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA), which are known to enhance synaptic plasticity. Blocking
receptors for these neuromodulators in the hippocampus prevents animals from forming new spatial and
contextual memories. Based on these ﬁndings, we hypothesize that surprising events enhance memory
because they induce catecholamine release at the same time the hippocampus is actively
rehearsing/replaying new information. Our preliminary data demonstrate that NE and DA are both
released in the hippocampus during and after the presentation of an unexpected aversive stimulus. At
the same time, there is an increase in sharp-wave ripple oscillations (SWRs), which are known to contain
replay sequences for recently encountered stimuli. Consequently, we will test the hypothesis above by
monitoring and manipulating catecholamine release in real-time during an aversive learning task while
simultaneously recording oscillations and single unit activity in the hippocampus.
Abstract of Proposed Research Project
Savannah is a third year Neuroscience graduate student who started working in my lab in March, 2023.
She arrived with experience performing behavioral assays in mice, but little experience imaging and
manipulating neural activity in vivo. During the training period, Savannah will use ﬁber photometry and
optogenetic techniques to monitor and manipulate the activity of dopaminergic neurons in the VTA
during an aversive learning task that depends in the hippocampus (trace fear conditioning). In previous
studies (proposed in the parent RO1), we used these techniques to image activity and induce DA release
in the hippocampus by stimulating LC neurons during trace fear conditioning. This work revealed that the
LC was the primary source of the observed DA signal in dorsal CA1 during aversive learning. It also
showed that DA functioned as a salience signal and did not appear to convey information about
prediction errors. In addition to the LC, these experiments demonstrated that there was a small, but
signiﬁcant, amount of DA released into dorsal CA1 from the VTA (Figure 1A). This is consistent with the
recent ﬁnding that a small population of dopaminergic neurons in the VTA respond to aversive stimuli1,2.
Similar to data we obtained in the LC, lesioning the VTA produced a signiﬁcant long-term memory deﬁcit
in TFC (Figure 1B). Based on these data, the goal of the current project is to: 1) examine how
dopaminergic neurons in the VTA (and their terminals in dorsal CA1) respond during TFC 2) determine the
eGects of VTA stimulation on dopamine release in dorsal CA1 as well as long-term memory formation.
These experiments will extend the ﬁndings of the parent grant by determining if DA release by the VTA
plays a distinct role in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory."

Parent project title: Dynamics and evolution of synthetic and natural gene regulatory networks
This Administrative Supplement is based on NOT-GM-24-021, “Notice of Special Interest (NOSI):
Administrative Supplements for Equipment Purchases for Select NIGMS-Funded Awards”. It is a
request for support for a “Jess” automated capillary-based western blot system by Bio-Techne, which
allows for rapid, quantitative, highly reproducible, and multiplexed detection of up to 12 protein targets
in a single sample without a need for genetical modification. These capabilities will be crucial for the
parent project, which aims to learn how perturbed gene regulatory network dynamics and
stochasticity affect single cells and thereby cell populations. To achieve this, we proposed using
synthetic gene networks to generate specific gene expression patterns in space and time that serve
as perturbation signals for natural gene networks, to study the subsequent effects on cell population
behavior and evolution by computational modeling and experimental evolution. Unlike RNAs, which
are relatively easy to quantify by sequencing, multi-protein quantification is still a challenge. Upon
synthetic biological perturbation, the Jess system will uniquely unveil native regulatory network states
at the protein level so that we can link them with cellular phenotypes. Overall, the Jess system will
provide unique capabilities to illuminate at the protein level how regulatory networks enact control
across scales of space and time in biology, from molecules to cells. This information will help us
control adapting cell populations, which is relevant for understanding, predicting and possibly
mitigating cancer and microbial drug resistance."

11037216,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Approximately 80% of drugs in the pharmacopeia are small molecules. Half of those small molecules act
on extracellular targets, and half act on intracellular targets. The remaining 20% of drugs are proteins, and
virtually all of those proteins are antibodies, hormones, or enzymes that act on extracellular targets. The
proposed research will enable proteins to act on intracellular targets. The proposed research program
takes advantage of new chemical reactivity that is applicable in a physiological context. The overall goal
is to develop a facile, general means to endow native proteins with the ability to enter the cytosol of
human cells with desirable consequences. The strategy is to esterify protein carboxyl groups by using
α-aryl-α-diazoamides. The basicity of these diazo compounds are tuned to enable the efficient
esterification of carboxyl groups in water. The resulting esterified proteins are analogous to small-
molecule prodrugs. Intracellular esterases make these modifications traceless, avoiding any compromise
to proper function or potential for immunogenicity. “Protein esterification” has an uncharted landscape.
Accordingly, work will begin by exploring fundamental attributes of esterified proteins, including the
mechanism of cellular uptake and the enzymology of ester hydrolysis by cellular esterases. Esterification
will then be used to deliver proteins for eliciting cytotoxicity, tumor suppression, and genome editing.
The work relies on methods and ideas from chemical biology and allied fields, especially organic
chemistry and enzymology. The research will establish a new paradigm for developing chemotherapeutic
agents that are capable of addressing numerous unmet medical needs."
11037474,"The overall goal of this application is to define mechanisms of glycan metabolism by bacteria inhabiting the
human gut microbiome so as to establish novel therapeutic pathways to manipulating the composition of the gut
microbial community to treat myriad human diseases. The gut microbiota has a profound effect on human health
and physiology, providing the host benefits such as modulation of immune development, inhibition of pathogen
colonization, digestion of dietary fibers and absorption of nutrients. Abnormalities in microbiota composition, or
dysbiosis, however, have been implicated in numerous and diverse disease states. A critical variable that
dictates the composition and physiology of the microbiota is the influx of glycans into the intestine, mostly from
diet and host mucosal secretions. Given the broad diversity of glycans that enter and exist in the gut,
microorganisms must possess varied and efficient strategies for competing for these nutrients, on which they
depend as a critical energy source. Despite the prominence of glycans in the human intestine and its documented
role in controlling important aspects of health and disease, the molecular mechanisms of glycan breakdown and
import employed by gut microbes remain poorly understood. This severely limits our ability to build an intellectual
framework for the design of methods and molecules with which to remodel the composition of the gut microbiota
in order to improve human health – for instance, to favor commensal over pathogenic bacteria or to limit the
growth of inflammatory or antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Here, we propose mechanistic studies using biochemical,
biophysical and genetic techniques to define pathways employed by gut microbes for the degradation and import
of various glycans, and to determine the structures and functions of key enzymes that release glycans, as well
as their interactions and functional cooperation with proteins that capture these released glycans. This work is
significant because it addresses molecular mechanisms involved in the major human health burden of dysbiosis.
The proposed studies are innovative both technically and conceptually – from the development and employment
of novel mass spectrometry-based methods for measuring the specificity and kinetics of protein deglycosylation
to the hypotheses that a single bacterium can express multiple enzymes with the same glycan specificity in order
to survive in distinct environments and that glycan-hydrolyzing enzymes have evolved to become a new class of
cell surface glycan-binding proteins. The research plan will be accomplished through ongoing and new

Cytokine signaling is essential to the initiation of the immune response against microbial infection and cancer.
The immune system is composed of two mechanisms of defense defined as the innate and adaptive immune
systems, both of which critically rely on cytokine signaling to function. The innate immune system acts early
during an infection or cancer and includes the type I IFN response. The adaptive immune system becomes fully
active after approximately seven days. Although this response is delayed relative to the innate system, the time
is needed to mount a T-cell response that is potent and specific. Interleukin-2 and interferon gamma are
examples of cytokines that shape the response of the adaptive immune system. There are dozens of other
cytokine families that each play an important role in the immune system including hematopoiesis, inflammation,
apoptosis as well as many others. Understanding how cytokines signal, the genes they induce, and their
functions are critical to understanding human health and disease. Recent examples of engineered cytokines
demonstrate that tuning of cytokine signaling can drastically alter a cytokine’s response and may offer promising
new therapeutic approaches. In this proposal, we aim to use protein engineering technologies to fill the large
gaps in knowledge of cytokine signaling which may reveal new targets and approaches for therapeutic
intervention.
 The paradigm of cytokine signaling is that cytokines drive the dimerization of cytokine receptors. Janus
kinases (JAKs) are believed to be constitutively bound to the cytokine receptors. Upon receptor dimerization, the
JAKs cross phosphorylate each other as well as the receptors. Signal transducers and activators of transcription
(STATs) bind to the phosphorylated receptors, are then phosphorylated, dimerize, and translocate to the nucleus
to elicit gene and functional responses. Recent tool development in our lab provides a streamlined approach to
characterize protein-protein interactions which occur intracellularly, challenge assumptions in the field, and
provide an opportunity to understand how every step in cytokine signaling contributes to cytokine signaling. We
aim to show how altering these interactions tune cytokine signaling and response gene and functional signature."

Project Summary
High titers of anti-NMDAR1 IgG autoantibodies in brain cause anti-NMDAR1 encephalitis that exhibits
psychosis, impaired memory, and many other psychiatric symptoms in addition to neurological symptoms. We
found that blood circulating anti-NMDAR1 IgG autoantibodies are sufficient to impair spatial working memory
(p=2.02E-08, power: 1) with a large effect size (d=2.3) in the integrity of the blood-brain barriers (BBB). Low
titers of natural anti-NMDAR1 autoantibodies, predominantly IgM or IgA isotype, were reported in the blood of
~5-10% of the general human population and psychiatric patients. It is unknown whether chronic presence of
these natural anti-NMDAR1 autoantibodies may impact human cognitive functions. After quantifying the levels
of plasma natural anti-NMDAR1 autoantibodies in 143 Marines, we found that Marines with higher levels of
natural anti-NMDAR1 autoantibodies have significantly better cognitive functions in both Continuous
Performance Test (reaction time in CPT, p=0.00029) and Short Letter N-Back test (reaction time in SLNB,
p=0.00091) than Marines with lower levels of the autoantibodies. Consistent with the pro-cognition, high levels
of natural anti-NMDAR1 autoantibodies protect (p=0.048) from the development of TBI-associated symptoms.
Anti-NMDAR1 autoantibodies had been reported to provide protections against neuronal excitotoxicity caused
by excessive glutamate in neurological diseases. Therefore, it appears that blood circulating anti-NMDAR1
autoantibodies may have two opposing effects. Synaptic NMDARs are essential for cognitive function and
their activation promotes neuronal survival, whereas activation of extrasynaptic NMDARs is responsible for
neuronal excitotoxicity. Unlike small IgG, IgM antibodies (diameter of ~30 nm) are physically too large to enter
synaptic cleft (width: 20-30 nm) to suppress synaptic NMDAR-mediated neurotransmission but are restricted to
bind extrasynaptic NMDARs and therefore specifically inhibit neuronal excitotoxicity. Hence, we hypothesize
that blood circulating anti-NMDAR1 IgM autoantibodies are both neuroprotective and pro-cognitive, whereas
blood circulating anti-NMDAR1 IgG and IgA autoantibodies are detrimental to cognitive functions. We propose
two specific aims for this 3-year R01 application. In Aim 1, we will validate pro-cognitive and neuroprotective
functions of pre-existing IgM anti-NMDAR1 autoantibodies by quantifying plasma anti-NMDAR1 IgM, IgA, IgG
autoantibodies, respectively, in humans. In Aim 2, we will cross-species validate pro-cognition and
neuroprotection of IgM anti-NMDAR1 autoantibodies by generating mice carrying either IgM or (IgG and IgA)
only anti-NMDAR1 autoantibodies. Immunogold electron microscopy will be used to validate that IgM anti-
NMDAR1 autoantibodies can only bind extrasynaptic NMDAR1 but not synaptic NMDAR1 in brain. Success of
the proposed studies will open up a new avenue for the development of therapeutic IgM anti-NMDAR1
autoantibodies that can promote cognitive functions and protect from neuronal excitotoxicity in many
neurological diseases and psychiatric disorders including TBI, PTSD, and schizophrenia.

Chromatin provides a means to compartmentalize the genome into active (euchromatin) and heritably repressed
(heterochromatin) states. Changes in these states accompany changes in cellular differentiation and are
essential for stabilizing cellular identity. Both types of chromatin states are maintained and rearranged by the
combined action of diverse ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling motors and specific chromatin binding
proteins. The proposed work is aimed at studying the core mechanisms of some of the major
chromatin regulators to achieve a better understanding of how their activities are regulated in vivo. Using a
variety of biophysical approaches, we have uncovered that ATP-dependent remodelers use sophisticated auto-
inhibition based mechanisms. We have also uncovered hexasomes as the preferred substrate for one type of
conserved remodeler. These findings provide a biophysical basis for further probing why different remodelers
have different biological roles. We had previously discovered phase-separation behavior by HP1 proteins, the
core components of heterochromatin. Since then, we have uncovered that phase-separated heterochromatin
reconstituted in a test-tube possesses several of the biophysical properties attributed to heterochromatin in cells.
Here we will build on these new discoveries to ask the following questions:
1. Why are their differences in mechanism between remodelers from different classes?
2. How does action of remodelers at the nucleosome scale impact chromatin at bigger scales?
3. What is the role of phase-separation in heterochromatin regulation?"
11037663,"Genome instability, characterized by increased formation of DNA mutations and other genetic
modifications, is a causative factor in multiple human diseases including cancer, infectious
diseases, and neurodegenerative disorders. The translesion synthesis (TLS) pathway, by means
of its low fidelity polymerases, causes mutagenesis by bypassing DNA damages and filling post-
replicative DNA gaps; a process principally orchestrated by the REV1 polymerase. Thus, TLS
and REV1 are essential components of genome instability that drive the formation of new
mutations that then translate into new, and often deleterious cellular functions. Recent discoveries
from my laboratory challenge this one-dimensional model and have profound implications for
understanding human disease and may offer opportunities to develop new therapeutics. We have
discovered that the REV1 polymerase has a broader role in controlling genome instability than
originally thought. REV1 regulates autophagy, metabolic processes, mitosis fidelity, and
replication stress through rereplication. We have evidence that these additional, previously
unrecognized roles of REV1 regulate cellular metabolic choices of autophagy versus senescence
in response to different types of DNA damages and as such might control cell death mechanisms.
Furthermore, our preliminary data unexpectedly showed that REV1 directly regulates autophagy,
mitosis, and rereplication proteins. While these early results are enticing, the fundamentals of
these discoveries—how REV1 controls cellular metabolism and participates in mitosis fidelity and
rereplication are a black box. The work proposed here will systematically tease apart the
mechanistic basis of the new roles of the REV1 polymerase. The goals of this proposal are to
determine the mechanisms by which REV1 exercises these newly recognized functions by
utilizing novel and cutting-edge tools to ask basic biological questions. Successful completion of
our proposed studies will redefine the role of REV1, from an error-prone polymerase that
participates in the TLS DNA mutagenesis process to a multi-dimensional regulator that controls
disease onset or progression by not only making mutations in DNA, but also by controlling cellular
metabolism, mitotic fidelity, and rereplication, central to the genome instability process."

represent a unique opportunity to understand the regulatory relationships between genetic programs of cell
fate and the regulation of the cell cycle, both central questions in the study of development, tissue
homeostasis, regeneration, and proliferative disorders such as cancer. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans
has been a powerful model in which to study the regulation of cell fate and cell cycle control owing to its
genetic tractability, transparent body and embryo, and stereotyped cell lineage. Like most nematodes, C.
elegans exhibits eutely or a fixed number of somatic cells in each individual of the same sex. Cell fate in the
wild-type animal can thus be determined solely on the basis of its lineage history, for which we have developed
extensive tools and approaches for automated reconstruction via 3D timelapse microscopy. Using C. elegans
and genetic perturbations that result in transformations of cell fate with its lineage, in combination with
automated lineage tracing and spatial transcriptomics approaches, we will investigate the mechanisms by
which cell fate influences the duration of a stem cell’s cell cycle as well as the mechanisms by which the
duration of a cell cycle can influence cell fate.
The work described in this proposal represents a novel approach to considering these links, enabled by our
development of lineage tracing technologies and quantitative approaches to discovering structure in cell
lineages. Building on this expertise, as well as our imaging resources and collaborations with other tools
developers, theorists, and developmental biologists, we will continue to advance the state-of-the-art in lineage-
resolved studies of metazoan development. In particular, using our advances in deep learning techniques to
enable label-free automated lineage tracing in non-model species in which transgenesis remains impossible or
difficult, we will leverage an evolutionary approach to understanding the design principles of gene networks
that drive cell fate decisions and control cell cycle progression in the early embryo. Over the next five years we
will complete detailed characterizations of co-dependencies between cell cycle timing and cell fate in the C.
elegans embryo, create a molecular atlas of cell fate and cell cycle regulation in wild type and mutant C.
elegans where cell fate patterning is perturbed, and complete the reconstruction and quantitative analysis of
the embryonic lineages of S. stercoralis, P. pacificus, and C. angaria. In the long term, we plan to extend our
molecular analyses to these species as well, beginning with C. angaria as an attractive model for studying the
evolution of cell fate control networks and their interactions with regulators of the cell cycle. These insights will
be of broad value to our understanding of developmental processes, and the resources we will establish will
facilitate the work of others on diverse problems in emerging model systems."

Ubiquitin is a 76 amino acid peptide that can be covalently conjugated to substrates to alter protein fate in
diverse ways, regulating protein degradation, trafficking, subcellular localization and protein-protein
interactions. Given its versatility, ubiquitin regulates many fundamental cellular processes, and its
dysregulation is associated with many human diseases ranging from neurodegeneration to cancer. Ubiquitin
networks include conjugating and deconjugating enzymes as well as effector pathways comprised of ubiquitin
binding proteins that direct the fate of ubiquitin-modified substrates. All of these elements work together to
“write”, “read”, and “edit” the ubiquitin code – which ultimately consists of ubiquitin polymers of different lengths
and topologies that determine which effector pathways are engaged. Here, we describe two main research
directions that will result in a deeper understanding of the ubiquitin code and how it regulates diverse cellular
functions, including stress signaling and membrane trafficking. The first research direction will address how
phosphorylation of ubiquitin at the Ser57 position regulates stress responses in yeast and human cells. The
proposed studies will build on our recent discovery of a small group of Ser57 ubiquitin kinases conserved from
yeast to humans and will include genetic, biochemical, and proteomic approaches. Specifically, we will
determine how these kinases and Ser57 phosphorylation of ubiquitin contribute to the cellular stress response,
and we will address how ubiquitin phosphorylation alters its interaction profile and engagement with effector
pathways. This research will contribute transformative new insights into the biology of ubiquitin and
proteostasis. The second research direction will address how human glucose transporters are regulated by
ubiquitin modification and endocytic trafficking. Glucose transporters of the GLUT family are key regulators of
cellular glucose homeostasis, and yet regulation of their trafficking and quality control remain poorly
characterized. Here, we describe lines of investigation based on our recent findings that GLUT1 endocytic
trafficking is regulated by specific ubiquitin modifications. These studies have important implications for cellular
glucose homeostasis and human diseases including GLUT1 Deficiency Syndrome and many types of cancer.
Together, these research directions will result in a deeper understanding of the ubiquitin code, membrane
trafficking, and stress responses in eukaryotic cells."
11037226,"PROJECT SUMMARY
During the production of therapeutic biologicals, glycosylation has been identified as a critical quality attribute
(CQA) that must be carefully monitored to ensure that the desired protein stability, immunogenicity, antibody
effector function, pharmacological safety and potency, and serum half-life are consistently obtained. Many
factors can affect the composition of the glycan chains during production, such as media, temperature,
dissolved gases, induction times, etc., and consequently variations in glycosylation are among the leading
causes of pharmaceutical batch rejection.
Currently, the characterization of protein glycosylation relies heavily on methods that employ chromatography
and/or mass spectrometry, which require a high level of expertise, are time-consuming and costly, and,
because they are challenging to implement during biologics production at-line, are generally performed only
post-production. In recognition of the continuing need for novel analytical technologies that can be used during
therapeutic production, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) encourages the adoption of new process
analytical methods (PAT) that offer mechanisms to design, analyze, or facilitate the measurement of process
parameters that affect CQAs. Here we propose to optimize and commercialize a simplified approach for
monitoring glycosylation features during glycoprotein production, which we call GlycoSenseTM, that is fully
aligned with the FDA PAT initiative.
The GlycoSense technology uses flow cytometry with glycan-specific reagents conjugated to multiplex beads
to provide a rapid, inexpensive, and easy-to-use method for monitoring protein glycosylation patterns. Flow
cytometry was chosen as the preferred platform because the data are statistically robust, the equipment is
relatively commonplace, the analyses consume very low quantities of sample, and it will enable Lectenz Bio to
leverage its proprietary expertise in producing carbohydrate-sensing reagents.
In preliminary studies reported here, GlycoSense performance metrics were established and published using
glycans and glycoprotein standards. In phase II, the technology will be optimized for monitoring glycosylation
changes during cell culture. This will result in GlycoSense kits that can be used for a variety of applications in
basic research and in biopharma."
11037516,"ABSTRACT (Parent Grant)
Identification of high-quality chemical probes, molecules with high specificity and selectivity against
macromolecules, is of critical interest to drug discovery. Although millions of compounds have been screened
against thousands of protein targets, small-molecule probes are currently available for only 4% of the human
proteome. Thus, more efficient approaches are required to accelerate the development of novel, target-specific
probes. In 2019, a new bold initiative called “Target 2035” was launched with the goal of “creating […] chemical
probes, and/or functional antibodies for the entire proteome” by 2035. In support of this ambitious initiative, we
propose to develop and test a novel integrative AI-driven methodology for rapid chemical probe discovery against
any target protein. Here, we will build an integrative workflow where the unique XChem database of experimental
crystallographic information describing the pose and nature of chemical fragments binding to the target protein
will be used in several innovative computational approaches to predict the structure of organic molecules with
high affinity towards specific targets. The candidate molecules will be experimentally validated and then
optimized, using computational algorithms, into lead molecules to seed chemical probe development. The
proposed project is structured around three following interrelated keystones: (i) Develop a novel method for
ligand-binding hot-spot identification and discovery of novel chemical probe candidates; (ii) Develop novel
fragment-based integrative computational approach for accelerated de novo design of chemical probes; (iii)
Consensus prediction of target-specific ligands, synthesis, and experimental validation of computational hits.
 More specifically, we will develop a hybrid method to predict structures of high-affinity ligands for proteins for
which XChem fragment screens have been completed. These approaches will be used for screening of ultra-
large (>10 billion) chemical libraries to identify putative high affinity ligands within crystallographically determined
pockets. Then, we will develop and employ an approach using graph convolutional neural networks for de novo
design of a library of strong binders that will be evaluated to select the best candidates for chemical optimization.
Finally, we will combine traditional structure-based and novel approaches, developed in this project to select
consensus hit compounds against three target proteins: transcription factor brachyury, hydrolase NUDT5, and
bromodomain BAZ2B. Iterative design guided by the computational algorithms, synthesis, and testing will
progressively optimize molecules to micromolar leads to chemical probes for the target proteins.
 Completion of the proposed aims will deliver a robust integrative workflow to identify leads for chemical
probes against diverse target proteins. We expect that our AI-based computational approach to convert
crystallographically-determined chemical fragments into lead compounds coupled with the experimental
validation of computational algorithms will accelerate the discovery of new chemical probes, expand the
druggable proteome, and support future drug discovery studies"

To improve the health and wellbeing of our nation’s children, it is essential to transform pediatric health care to
address the complex social ecological factors that persistently hamper access to child health and contribute to
pervasive health inequities. The overall goal of the Research Expanding Access to Child Health (REACH) Center
of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) is to strengthen pediatric healthcare delivery research infra-
structure at the Nemours Children’s Hospital-Delaware (NCH-D) and establish robust programs of research,
using stakeholder-engaged approaches to develop acceptable, feasible, and effective interventions and models
of care to achieve health equity. The REACH Center will soon conclude its second year of funding and it has
seen great success. Two research cores -- PROMISE (Pediatric Research Optimizing Methods in Stakeholder
Engagement) and IMPACT (Intervention Methods: Provision and Connection through Technology) – are
providing research infrastructure to investigators across Delaware. Project funding, research management
support, and mentorship focused on the transition to independence (Launch mentorship) has been provided to
six investigators to date with another three pilot projects starting in March 2024. Additionally, career development
and leadership training (Lead mentorship) has been provided to independent REACH Center investigators to
foster their promotion and retention. This application for an Administrative Supplement to Recognize Excellence
in Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) Mentorship will allow for an expansion of our Lead
mentorship program to focus on issues of DEIA in our Center. Lead is overseen by Melissa A. Alderfer, Ph.D.,
MPI of the REACH Center, who will serve as PI/PD for this supplement. Dr. Alderfer is an experienced mentor
committed to her mentee’s scientific and professional development and career progress. As a woman and first-
generation scholar from a disadvantaged background, she has sought out and cultivated the development of a
diverse group of mentees and prioritized establishing an inclusive research environment within our Center. The
supplemental funds will expand these efforts in three ways: Aim 1) Extend the Lead mentorship program to
REACH Center staff and trainees from diverse backgrounds and provide culturally aware mentorship training to
all; Aim 2) Expand our efforts to foster and fund health equity research led by investigators from diverse
backgrounds through targeted mentorship; and, Aim 3) Establish a mentored research experience to introduce
cohorts of diverse trainees and community members to biomedical research. It is widely accepted that diversity
at all levels of the scientific workforce enhances the innovation, conduct, quality, and impact of research. DEIA
is particularly important in the REACH Center given our focus on reducing health disparities and social inequities.
The proposed enhancements to our Lead Mentorship Program are within the scope of our active award, will
have a broad impact on our training environment at NCH-D, and will catalyze the ability of the REACH Center to
propel scientific knowledge and clinical practice forward to equitably improve health for all children."

This proposal focuses on the activation and utilization of dioxygen by heme and nonheme transition metal centers
in metalloenzymes and in related synthetic systems. A subset of nonheme iron enzymes utilize a single iron
center to activate dioxygen and mediate the oxidation of various substrates, including sulfur substrates as seen
in thiol dioxygenases (TDOs) (e.g. cysteine dioxygenase (CDO)), persulfide dioxygenases (PDOs) (e.g.
ethylmalonic encephalopathy protein (ETHE1)), sulfoxide synthases (e.g. EgtB, OvoA), and isopenicillin N
synthase (IPNS). The related nonheme iron hydroxylases (e.g. TauD) and halogenases (e.g. SyrB2) also
activate O2 with a single iron center to transform C-H bonds into C-X (X = OH, Cl) groups. Many questions remain
regarding the mechanisms of action of these proteins, although the proposed pathways for these different
enzymes include several common iron/oxygen intermediates. Heme enzymes also activate O2 for similar
oxidative chemistry, such as C-H hydroxylation carried out by the monooxygenase cytochrome P450 (CYP), or
the C-C bond cleavage and dioxygenation of indoles carried out by tryptophan and indoleamine dioxygenase
(TDO/IDO). The proposed efforts involve the synthesis of biomimetic heme and nonheme iron complexes that
will be used to examine how the first and second coordination spheres influence O2 activation and substrate
oxidations. Efforts will be made to characterize metastable transition metal/O2 species (e.g. M-O2, M-OOH, M=O,
M-OH) that are proposed as key intermediates in heme and nonheme O2 activation. Characterization of these
species in structurally well-defined complexes will provide support for the analogous, putative intermediates in
the enzymatic systems. The feasibility of key bond-making and bond-breaking events will be established by
examining the reactivity of these metal/oxygen adducts with various substrates. Mechanistic questions will be
addressed through comprehensive thermodynamic and kinetic studies. Systematic modifications will be made
to these low molecular weight complexes through established synthetic methodologies, providing atomic-level
control over their geometric/electronic structures. This approach provides a means to establish structure-function
relationships that can be challenging or impossible to obtain when studying the enzymes alone. Questions to be
addressed include what are the key intermediates during heme and nonheme iron activation of O2? What are
the key spectroscopic features of these intermediates? Which of these species are capable of oxidizing which
substrates? How does the structural and electronic properties of the ligands holding the metal center influence
the O2 activation process? What controls the selectivity of substrate oxidations? Addressing these questions
should lead to new knowledge regarding how heme and nonheme iron enzymes activate O2 and selectively
oxidize substrates. These enzymes participate in biological processes that are essential for human health and
disease, making them targets for both diagnostic and therapeutic treatments."
11036800,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The overarching research goal of the PI’s research program aims to advance imaging science and technology
to transform biomedical research. To date, a complete understanding is still lacking to elucidate how biomole-
cules, organelles, and microenvironments are assembled within single cells, their variations over large popula-
tions, and their integrated roles in cell and tissue functions, developments, and disease initiation and therapeutics.
There have been major unmet imaging needs to probe the intracellular and multi-parametric complexities and
heterogeneity in cells and tissues with 3D nanoscale resolution, volumetric capability, high throughput and sen-
sitivity, and platform generalizability. To address the demands, the PI’s laboratory investigates the novel physical,
engineering, and instrumental principles and systems and deploys them to illuminate both fundamental and
medical discoveries. This renewal proposal aims to continue the efforts and establish and strengthen the pro-
gram’s leadership in systems biophotonics at the critical interface between imaging innovations and life sciences.
Specifically, the PI proposes the research program to proceed in three major directions to provide enabling
technologies that overcome imaging challenges in space, time, and accessibility for a deeper understanding of
biological complexities: (1) wave physics and super-resolution microscopy to probe intracellular complexities and
heterogeneity with 3D ultrahigh-resolution, volumetric capability, high throughput and sensitivity, and platform
generalizability; (2) light-field microscopy and computational microscopy to enable the interrogation and ultrafast,
in vivo imaging of multi-scale, volumetric biological dynamics and activities; (3) miniature microscopy and camera
physics to transform conventional imaging platforms and enhance imaging device accessibility to wide-ranging
imaging conditions, modalities, and biological systems. The successful accomplishment and dissemination of
the proposed research are anticipated to (i) promise and catalyze the discovery and translation of imaging sci-
ence and technology, (ii) provide methodological avenues and revolutionize biomedical investigations restrained
by conventional methods, and (iii) transform existing imaging infrastructure, laying a critical intellectual founda-
tion for broader science, engineering, and technology breakthroughs."
11036529,"Project Summary
Nucleosomes cover most of the eukaryotic genome and present a barrier for the competent binding of many
regulatory proteins that control gene expression. A special set of transcription factors called pioneer factors can
bind their target sites on nucleosomal DNA, loosen chromatin, and promote the activity of other chromatin factors
and enzymes, leading to nucleosome repositioning and gene activation. Sox2 and Oct4 are pioneer factors that
orchestrate changes in cell fate during embryogenesis and adult neurogenesis and are major players in the
reprogramming of somatic cells into a pluripotent state. Mutation and deficiency in these proteins are linked to
neurological disorders, while their enrichment is tied to cancer. Despite ample studies, little is known about how
to Sox2, Oct4 and other pioneer factors exert their pioneering activity at the molecular level. Our goal is to
address key unresolved questions about how Sox2 and Oct4 engage with nucleosomes in distinct binding modes
and alter the structure and dynamics of nucleosomes, and how these changes affect the downstream action of
chromatin modifying and remodeling enzymes. Towards this goal, we propose to integrate chemical probing
assays with high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to obtain site-specific structural
and dynamic information about pioneer factor interaction with nucleosomes and the perturbations they elicit in
DNA and histones to potentially regulate other factors. In Aim 1, we will utilize in vitro binding assays to
characterize distinct binding modes of Sox2 and Oct4 to artificial and natural nucleosomes and their dependence
on DNA sequence, co-factor cooperativity, and histone composition. We will also adapt methyl TROSY NMR,
suitable for studies of super-large biomolecules, to interrogate the site-specific binding conformation and
dynamics of these proteins to select nucleosomes with atomic detail. In Aim 2, we will examine the effect of Sox2
and Oct4 binding in various nucleosome positions on the conformation and accessibility of nucleosomal DNA
and the disordered histone tails by using NMR, chemical and enzymatic probing methods sensitive to structural
and dynamic perturbations. We will further assess whether Sox2 and Oct4, through direct contact and
nucleosome perturbations, stimulate the activity of histone methyltransferase enzymes that are found to
collaborate in vivo with these pioneer factors. Finally, in Aim 3, we will adapt our approach to characterize how
a methyl-DNA binding protein and proposed pioneer factor Kaiso binds to and alters nucleosomes, providing
insight into the recognition and function of epigenetic DNA marks in chromatin regulation. The proposed work
will lay the basis for future investigations of other pioneer factors and the role of DNA context, synergistic action,
histone variants and epigenetic modifications into pioneer factor-mediated chromatin opening. This will improve
our ability to modify pioneer factor function and lead to novel approaches for therapeutic targeting."

Bacterial drug resistance is a significant global health threat that has turned once treatable
bacterial infections (including Gram-positive infections) into deadly illnesses. To overcome this
serious threat to human health, completely novel antibiotics are needed. The T-box riboswitch is
a noncoding RNA that regulates the expression of essential genes in many Gram-positive
bacteria (including pathogenic examples), thus making it a unique target for novel antibacterial
agents. A key component of the T-box riboswitch regulatory mechanism involves tRNA binding
to the highly conserved antiterminator RNA element--an excellent target for drug discovery. This
project will explore the rational design of allosteric modulators of T-box antiterminator RNA
function and compare their efficacy to that of competitive inhibitors. No therapeutic agents are
currently known to specifically target the T-box riboswitch.
This supplement request proposal seeks to replace a 14-year old microplate reader that is
failing. Replacement of this essential piece of equipment will enable us to fulfill the specific aims
of the parent award.
The proposed research is unchanged from the parent award where we planned to use
computational methods to design the next generation of compounds that inhibit T-box riboswitch
function, then synthesize and test them in high throughput screening assays followed by
characterization of RNA binding mode.
Achievement of the proposed specific aims of the parent award will improve scientific
knowledge by developing design strategies to identify inhibitors (including allosteric modulators)
of RNA function and by exploring the most effective chemical space features of these small
molecules. This information will be significant for antibacterial drug discovery targeting the T-box
riboswitch and also for the still emerging broader field of targeting noncoding regulatory RNA in
general for antibacterial, antiviral, anticancer and other drug discovery efforts. In the process, a
team of primarily undergraduate students will gain first-hand experience working on an
innovative drug discovery project that will inspire them to consider careers in biomedical
research."
11036822,"Abstract. Baltimore City is facing a significant health crisis surrounding rampant use of illicit substances such
as opioids. Opioid use disorder (OUD) continues to be a significant public health problem in the city with
overdoses continuing to surge. Poor access to care for OUD is contributing to the OUD national crisis, and
medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) such as methadone have been shown to be life-saving medication.
Despite the availability of MOUD, there are many challenges in retention in treatment for OUD in urban cities like
Baltimore. The parent award (R33DA057747; PI: Magidson) is innovatively designed to improve treatment
retention in a Baltimore-based treatment program for OUD using a peer-delivered behavioral intervention (“Peer

determinants of health influencetreatment outcomes of OUD and howthese neighborhood factors may moderate
the effect of the Peer Activate intervention on retention. The aims of the study include: 1) understand
neighborhood-related factors that impact methadone treatment retention; and 2) examine how neighborhood
factors may moderate the effectiveness of Peer Activate and how the intervention may be adapted to address
these factors in future work. For Aim 1, 30 study participants that received the Peer Activate intervention will be
recruited for semi-structuredinterviews, and the interviews will include questions revolving around environmental
structures of the neighborhood surrounding the treatment clinic, drop out, and relapse, and how they contribute
to low retention in treatment for OUD and how these neighborhood characteristics increase challenges in

physical layout, and violence, alcohol, and drug use indicators. Candidate. This supplement award will support
an exceptional candidate, Ms. Anane, who is a first generation Black/AfricanAmerican woman, Flagship Fellow

training workshops and seminars, including GIS for Humanities and Social Sciences and Modern Statistical
Learning for Observational Data. The findings from this supplement grant proposal will inform the candidate’s
dissertation research and prepare her for a NIH T32 training grant for post-doctoral research. This research will
make a unique contribution to understanding the influence of neighborhood-related factors to treatment retention
for low-income, largely ethnic/minority individuals in a methadone maintenance program and understanding

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Lipid regulation of cellular signaling and protein-protein interactions
Cellular proteins accomplish their functions through interactions with other proteins, forming complex
protein-protein interaction networks. Cellular protein-protein interaction typically involves small
modular protein interaction domains, such as Src-homology 2 and PSD95, Dlg1, ZO-1 domains.
Physiological significance of protein interaction domain-mediated protein-protein interaction networks
has been well supported by a large number of protein interaction domains encoded by human
genome and many human diseases, including cancer, caused by dysfunctional protein interaction
domain-mediated cellular processes. Interestingly, most protein interaction domains have moderate
binding affinity and a significant degree of promiscuity. This may be necessary for reversibility and
redundancy of cell signaling pathways but raises a fundamental question as to how high-fidelity
cellular function and regulation can be achieved through the protein interaction domain-mediated
protein-protein interaction. We have recently shown that membrane lipids, including cholesterol and
phosphoinositides, coordinate and regulate protein-protein interaction by directly and specifically
interacting with protein interaction domains. This important new discovery and our innovative in situ
quantitative lipid imaging technology provide us with a unique and unparalleled opportunity to
elucidate the mechanisms by which lipids orchestrate spatiotemporal specificity of protein-protein
interaction and cell signaling and develop new strategies to modulate these processes. Given the
importance of protein interaction domain-mediated protein-protein interaction and cell signaling in
health and disease, our proposed research should have a major impact on broad areas of biology and
medicine and lay the foundation for a pioneering and innovative drug discovery strategy for human

11036826,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Knowledge of how three-dimensional (3D) genome organization is linked to gene expression and chromatin
state is paramount to understanding human health and disease. The cohesin complex is a major regulator of
genome organization that dynamically extrudes DNA loops to bring together enhancers, promoters, and
insulators. While the insulator protein CTCF is known to capture and stabilize an extruding cohesin complex, it
is not clear how cohesin is stabilized at enhancers and promoters that lack CTCF. Furthermore, the causal role
of cohesin-mediated loops in regulating gene expression is not understood. We recently discovered that
cohesin variant complexes, composed of either STAG1 or STAG2 subunits and either PDS5A or PDS5B
subunits, colocalize across the genome, yet have surprisingly distinct effects on gene expression. In this
proposed study, we will answer the next set of questions about cohesin biology. We hypothesize that cohesin
complexes at specific genomic sites have distinct biochemical properties and binding partners that mediate
effects on transcription and chromatin state defined by histone modifications. To test these hypotheses, we are
using an integrative approach that combines genetic, biochemical, genomic, and proteomic assays in
embryonic stem cells and differentiated cells following genome editing, protein depletion, acute degradation, or
inhibition with small molecules. These studies will 1) identify novel cohesin-interacting proteins using proteomic
approaches, 2) investigate the properties of cohesin complexes at different genomic sites and with different
binding partners, and 3) elucidate the role of cohesin-mediated DNA loops in regulation of transcription and
chromatin state at genomic sites lacking CTCF. The proposed multi-disciplinary approach leverages our
extensive experience in functional genomics and expands on our recent findings that demonstrated roles for
cohesin subunits and cohesin regulators in DNA loop formation and transcription. This will contribute to our
long-term goal of applying cutting-edge technologies to uncover the molecular mechanisms that define how 3D
genome organization influences chromatin state and transcriptional control to govern cell identity. Completion
of this project will fill critical gaps in knowledge about gene regulation that inform our understanding of human
developmental disorders and cancers linked to epigenetic defects."
11036830,"Abstract
Accurate replication of the genome during cell proliferation is necessary for normal animal development and
homeostasis. Disruption of the regulation or fidelity of replication contributes to many human pathologies,
particularly cancer. Thus, a complete understanding of the mechanisms governing genome replication is
paramount to human health. Replication of large genomes like that found in human cells requires the initiation
of bi-directional DNA synthesis at thousands of individual locations on each chromosome. It also requires cell
cycle-regulated synthesis of large amounts of histone proteins to package newly replicated DNA into
chromatin. This project will focus on how chromatin assembly and organization influences genome replication
during animal development. The basic building block of chromatin is the nucleosome, an octamer of histone
proteins encompassed by ~147 base pairs of DNA. Most histone proteins within chromatin are synthesized
each S phase of the cell cycle from replication-dependent histone genes, which encode the only eukaryotic
mRNAs that end in a stem loop rather than a poly A tail. The genes encoding all five RD-histone proteins are
clustered in metazoan genomes, and transcription and pre-mRNA processing factors required for histone
mRNA biosynthesis are organized into a nuclear body (the Histone Locus Body or HLB) that assembles at
these gene clusters. We will determine the requirements for the coordinate synthesis of the RD-histone
mRNAs using both biochemical and genetic approaches in Drosophila, with a particular focus on the role that
the HLB plays in histone transcription and pre-mRNA processing. Each core histone protein has an N-terminal
tail that protrudes from the nucleosome core and is subject to a variety of chemical modifications (e.g.
methylation, acetylation, and phosphorylation) that modulate chromatin organization and thus influence all
aspects of genome function, including DNA replication. We have developed a method in Drosophila for
engineering any desired histone tail mutation, providing us a means of preventing modification of specific
histone residues and thus of manipulating chromatin organization in a way not available in any other animal.
This genetic approach will be combined with cell biological and next generation DNA sequencing methods to
determine how chromatin organization modulates DNA replication throughout the entire genome, thereby
addressing a major question in the field. Our Drosophila experimental paradigm permits the in vivo
interrogation of these fundamental processes in gene expression and DNA replication in ways that are

Proper wound healing is critical following surgery and injury, while compromised healing is a
factor in diseases such as diabetes, obesity, tobacco abuse, and malnutrition. As well, tissue
restoration after healing is limited, such that most repair leads to scar formation and loss of
function. With millions affected and billions in associated care costs yearly, impaired wound
healing, chronic wounds and fibrosis-related diseases represent a critical health burden. Data
reveals that the presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS), byproducts of aerobic metabolism
containing oxygen that are highly reactive, are critical to wound healing outcomes. ROS are also
necessary for cell signaling and play a role in host defense and injury signaling. But the current
evidence is contradictory, suggesting both positive (required for repair and immune recruitment)
and negative (promoting cell damage) roles for ROS. Furthermore, it is not clear whether wound
healing and regeneration are separable processes. Our preliminary data suggests that there are
different wound-specific and regenerative-specific ROS signaling pathways and demonstrates the
usefulness of planarians to parse the roles of ROS in tissue repair. While all multicellular
organisms possess wound responses and repair mechanisms, the signaling that promotes healing
and regeneration versus scarring remains a mystery. This proposal’s long term goal is to
understand how ROS signaling may be manipulated to regulate both wound healing and tissue
repair, identifying new targets for treatment and refining current therapies for better patient
outcomes. This proposal’s objective is to identify differences in ROS levels and signaling that switch
injury-induced ROS responses from control of wound healing to tissue repair. We have two
hypotheses: 1) that distinct ROS-initiated signaling pathways regulate wound healing versus tissue
repair, and 2) that the level and timing of ROS present at the wound site determines whether
wound healing or regrowth occurs. These will be tested with two specific aims: AIM 1) to identify
wound-only versus regenerative-specific expression of ROS-mediated genes, detecting any epistatic
interactions; and AIM 2) to test the effects of different ROS levels on regeneration (proliferation
and tissue growth) and wound healing (actin-mediated reepithelization). In alignment with the
AREA mechanism, this work is designed to be completed mainly by undergraduate students—in
order to foster future independence and train them in common techniques (such as microsurgery,
cloning, in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, and RNA interference). These studies will
advance our understanding of impaired wound healing and fibrosis, and uncover fundamental
principles of how ROS is utilized during repair."

 Nutrition in fetal and juvenile stages can have long-lasting consequences throughout the life of an
organism. In humans, poor nutrition in utero has been linked to type-II diabetes and cardiovascular
disease despite otherwise healthy diets later in life. In nature, animals can use the information from early
diet to make environment-appropriate developmental decisions that increase fitness of the adult. The
mechanisms that connect early-life diet and nutrition to developmental decisions and disease is poorly
understood. Identifying these mechanisms could 1) inform risk prevention strategies, 2) enable targeted
therapy to increase or decrease the positive or negative effects of diet, and 3) address a fundamental
gap in our understanding of development: how does the environment influence phenotype?
 To identify the mechanisms of dietary influence – a form of developmental plasticity – the Werner
lab uses the experimentally tractable model nematode Pristionchus pacificus. When juvenile P. pacificus
are reared in dietary restrictive conditions they develop a narrow mouth with a single denticle or “tooth”,
and are obligate bacterivores. However, if juveniles are reared in well-fed conditions that often lead to
crowding, they develop a wide mouth with two teeth, and can prey on other nematodes for food or
competitive advantage. The discrete developmental decision (bacterivore vs. predator) in a genetic model
organism provides a powerful system to investigate the molecular mechanisms of developmental
plasticity.
 Since receiving funding from the ESI-MIRA in the summer of 2023, the Werner Lab has used both
targeted mutagenesis and unbiased forward-genetic screens to identify genes which sense the nutritional
and/or metabolic state and affect morph choice. From previous work PI-Werner also identified epigenetic
modifications that affect both the developmental decision and the timing of the decision. This
Administrative Supplement request is for a Zeiss Axioscope 7 microscope capable of fluorescence and
differential interference contrast (DIC) (price quote = $52,316). This microscope can be used to reveal
the tissue-specific expression patterns of diet-sensing genes by fusing them to fluorescent reporters (e.g.,
GFP/RFP). Additionally, a series of DIC images at multiple focal planes (a ‘z-stack’) can be used for
Geometric Morphometrics, which has become an important tool for statistically assessing differences in
morphological shape. These features are not compatible with the microscope currently in the Werner
Lab. However, if funded, fluorescence and DIC on the Axioscope 7 can reveal when, where and how diet-
sensing genes influence “switch” gene transcription – and ultimately development."
11036816,"The opioid crisis has made it apparent that there is a tremendous need for analgesic drugs that do not target the
opioid receptors. Plants are an ideal source for developing these drugs, as they produce a diverse range of
natural products with analgesic activity, like salicylic acid, capsaicin, and cannabidiol. These compounds act on
different pain response systems in animals, like the endocannabinoid system. Aconitum, a genus of plants in the
Ranunculaceae family, is used in different traditional medicine systems around the world, often for its analgesic
and/or anti-inflammatory properties. In traditional Chinese medicine, Aconitum carmichaelii has been used for
thousands of years, and the bioactivity has been associated mainly with its diterpenoid alkaloid content. While
these compounds have been shown to be potent analgesics, some are cardiotoxic as well. Despite their similar
medicinal use, American Aconitum species have not been as thoroughly studied in terms of chemistry or
bioactivity. The long-term goal of our research is to identify, characterize, and quantify therapeutic components
in plants used in traditional medicine systems as sources of new drugs. The overall objective of this project is to
analyze Aconitum in North America, specifically regarding its analgesic diterpenoid alkaloids that lack
cardiotoxicity as compared to the better-studied Asian species. Our initial studies on Aconitum showed significant
variation in chemical structures and amounts of selected diterpenoid alkaloids, and we have identified fuziline
and neoline from Asian Aconitum carmichaelii as having analgesic activity without being cardiotoxic. Other
studies have found that these diterpenoid alkaloids target the cannabinoid receptors. Thus, we hypothesize that
a small group of diterpenoid alkaloids in American Aconitum species will have analgesic properties without the
concomitant cardiotoxicity. We will test this hypothesis by carrying out three aims. In Aim 1, we will collect and
examine eight Aconitum species and determine patterns of diterpenoid alkaloids using untargeted LC-QToF-MS
metabolomic studies. In Aim 2, we will assess plant extracts, fractions, and purified diterpenoid alkaloids from
American Aconitum species in high-throughput zebrafish assays to identify bioactive compounds that target pain
but do not have cardiotoxicity. In Aim 3, we will use a targeted LC-TQD-MS analysis to quantify the target
analgesic compounds in the eight Aconitum species, and join the metabolomic and biological data obtained in
Aims 1 and 2 together through novel metabolomic platforms, such as NP analyst, to create a molecular network
of analgesic compounds produced by Aconitum that lack cardiotoxicity Together, the completion of these three
aims will result in a group of analgesic compounds that will be prioritized for further preclinical studies. This
project will also train undergraduate and graduate students from underrepresented groups in modern
applications and technologies of natural product chemistry and provide them with opportunities for career
development by presenting at conferences and authoring manuscripts."

In native tissue, cell recruitment and positioning are controlled by directed migration, where cells sense
multiple guidance cues in their microenvironment and migrate preferentially toward or away from particular
signals. Although several types of guidance or ""taxis"" cues have been identified, the hierarchy between
simultaneously presented signals during directed migration remains poorly understood. Dissecting these
relationships will help enhance our understanding of cell motility in complex environments with broad
implications in therapeutic development to promote or inhibit migratory activity.
To expand our knowledge about the cues that promote directed cell migration, we propose a new experimental
platform that combines microengineered fiber alignment gradients with controlled soluble biochemical
gradients to endothelial, immune, and cancer cell migration within a complex 3D environment. Our platform
will allow us to uniquely expose cell populations to a controlled multi-cue 3D environment containing alignment
gradients and biochemical gradients to dissect how cells prioritize and respond to simultaneous guidance
cues. We hypothesize synergetic (additive) and hierarchal (competitive) relationships between biophysical and
biochemical guidance cues that influence directed cell migration. To test this hypothesis, we will carry out the
following aims: 1) Quantify migration within a microengineered 3D collagen gel environment with tunable
alignment landscapes, 2) Create biochemical gradients and quantify chemotactic responses within 3D gel
environments, and 3) Quantify motility responses within combined biophysical and biochemical gradient
environments.
Success in this project will establish a platform to uniquely study how cells sense, prioritize, and migrate in
response to multiple guidance cues (here, biophysical and biochemical gradients), with relevance to early
development, immune cell trafficking, vascularization, and cancer invasion."

 Our planet is inhabited by trillions of bacteria that live inside and outside of humans. The “skin”, or
surface, of bacteria is called the cell envelope, and functions to separate us from them. Although some bacteria
are symbionts, infection by pathogenic bacteria is still a major cause of death worldwide. While Gram-negative
bacteria contain a protective outer membrane layer absent in most Gram-positives, almost all bacteria contain
polymers composed of unique patterns of glycans that extend from the cell surface. Bacterial surface sugar
polymers, or exo-polysaccharides, act as molecular barcodes that distinguish different strains of bacteria within
a single species. Many bacterial exo-polysaccharides contain rare sugars, which are monosaccharides that are
absent in other organisms, including humans. While exo-polysaccharides are necessary for host infection, we
still lack an understanding of how rare sugar-containing glycan polymers are assembled, recognized, and enable
survival in the host.
 My laboratory seeks to generate chemical and biochemical tools to study bacterial protein and glycan
pathways that enable survival in different environments. Our main areas of focus are: (1) development of small
molecule regulators of bacterial chaperone function; (2) manipulation of cell surface sugar patterns to selectively
label and disable bacteria. This proposal focuses on the latter program, in which we identify rare saccharide
subunits that are unique to Gram-negative cell surface polymers called O-antigens, and represent key epitopes
that mediate interactions with hosts and susceptibility to antibiotics. Over the next five years, we will address the
following questions: (1) Can we improve chemoenzymatic routes to rare sugar precursor substrates? (2) How
do glycosyltransferases recognize rare sugar substrates to build O-antigens? (3) Are O-antigen
glycosyltransferases regulated via protein-protein interactions? (4) What host protein structural motifs are
involved in bacterial rare sugar recognition? (5) Can we identify new host proteins involved in bacterial
recognition? To answer these questions, we will use a multidisciplinary approach, involving a combination of
organic chemistry, chemical biology, biochemistry, microbiology and sequencing-based analyses. This work will
significantly expand our understanding of cellular mechanisms underlying bacterial polysaccharide synthesis,
and will teach us how humans recognize foreign sugars.
Relevance to public health: In addition to providing fundamental insight into the production of bacterial factors
that are important for infection, the results of this proposal will inform novel strategies to disable hard-to-treat
Gram-negative infections by interference of essential host-pathogen interactions, as well as biomolecular
reagents to recognize bacterial oligosaccharide structures for new diagnostics."

Substance use, particularly opioid use, during pregnancy is widespread and associated with adverse outcomes
for the pregnant individual and the developing child. Prenatal substance exposure is associated with a wide
range of negative fetal and child outcomes including reduced fetal growth, premature birth, lower birth weight,
congenital defects, increased neonatal healthcare, and heightened risk for later behavioral (e.g., anxiety,
inattention), cognitive (e.g., memory deficits, delayed language acquisition), and metabolic problems. It is
difficult to understand these strong links to adverse maternal, fetal, and child outcomes, without gathering a
complete picture of the other contextual factors and exposures that may contribute in a diverse and representative
sample from across the US.
 The HEALthy Brain and Child Development (HBCD) study is a 25-site longitudinal prospective study of
early child development in the US that will assess a broad spectrum of biological (e.g., neuroimaging, genetics,
epigenetics), behavioral (e.g., cognition and emotional regulation), experiential (e.g., trauma), social (e.g.,
racism), and health (e.g., psychopathology) factors among ~7,500 nationally-representative pregnant women
and their children from pregnancy to mid-childhood. A major goal of the HBCD study is to increase understanding
of the potential consequences of prenatal substance exposures. It will be enriched for maternal substance use
during pregnancy (i.e., ~25% of the sample will be using opioids, cannabis, alcohol, and/or tobacco during
pregnancy and 12% of the total sample will be using opioids) and offers a unique opportunity to inform our
understanding of how the adverse consequences associated with opioid use during pregnancy arise. It is
absolutely imperative that the populations recruited across sites be representative of the US birthing population
to ensure generalizable translation of the findings to be generated. This Diversity Supplement in response to
the NOSI to Encourage Eligible NIH HEAL Initiative Awardees to Apply for PA-20-222: Research Supplements
to Promote Diversity in Health-Related Research (NOT-NS-20-107) proposes to leverage the HBCD study to
better understand the impact of recruitment and retention strategies at the site level, combined with site
personnel structure, to optimize recruitment and retention of the vulnerable populations enrolled. The unique
combination of a standardized protocol being implemented across the US with the proposed qualitative
approaches will provide invaluable information for both optimizing recruitment as part of HBCD, as well as
informing future studies, leading to more equitable and inclusive science for all people."

 Understanding how proteins fold is a central quest in biology. Studied for over 50
years, investigations of soluble protein folding have proven invaluable for dissecting the
molecular basis of a multitude of diseases. By comparison, folding studies of membrane
proteins lag far behind. The knowledge gained from soluble protein studies cannot simply
be transferred to inferences about because their solvents are different. The balance of
forces encoding a MP embedded in a lipid bilayer must be distinct from that of soluble
proteins in water.
 Our research efforts contribute to filling this key gap in the understanding the physical
chemistry of membrane proteins. We will experimentally determine of energetic forces
stabilizing membrane proteins along the steeply changing polarity gradient of the
phospholipid bilayer interface, quantify backbone hydrogen bond strengths, and expand
our repertoire of membrane protein folding models to include those with an a-helical
secondary structure. These efforts will be complemented by molecular simulations and
other solution biophysics interrogations as needed.
 Our results have broad ranging impact in the field at large through contributions to
information databases used in training computational algorithms and by their

Two large macromolecular machines, the spindle and kinetochore, coordinate chromosome segregation at cell
division. Errors in their function can lead to cancer and birth defects. While we now know nearly all the
molecules required for mammalian spindle and kinetochore function, how they collectively give rise to these
machines’ emergent physical properties remains poorly understood. Our long-term goal is to uncover the basic
physical design principles of robust and accurate mammalian chromosome segregation. How do thousands of
nm-scale molecules, pushing and pulling, give rise to the spindle’s µm-scale steady-state architecture and
mechanics? How do hundreds of kinetochore molecules work together to ‘compute’ attachment signals for
decision-making, and to robustly grip microtubules? This knowledge gap persists because we cannot currently
reconstitute these machines in vitro, and lack tools in vivo. To close this gap, we need approaches to finely
control molecules and directly exert forces inside dividing mammalian cells – which we recently developed.
 First, we aim to define the mechanisms and functions of the spindle’s emergent architecture and
mechanics. (i) Based on our findings, we will test the idea that opposing stresses in the spindle are not
required to give it a steady-state structure, but are instead required to give it mechanical and functional
stability. Further, we will define in vivo and in vitro how active and passive forces contribute to building a
steady-state spindle. (ii) To uncover the function of the spindle’s specific steady-state shape, we developed an
optogenetic approach to acutely and locally control spindle architecture. We will use it to test the role of given
architectural modules in space and time through mitosis. (iii) To define the mechanisms underlying the steady-
state spindle’s mechanical robustness, we will use microneedle manipulation to deform the spindle, which we
recently adapted in mammalian cells, and modeling. Second, we aim to define how the kinetochore’s
molecules together enable it to ‘compute' attachment information and robustly grip microtubules. (i) Based on
our recent finding that only a few bound microtubules are needed for a kinetochore to allow anaphase, we will
quantitatively rewire kinetochore composition to test models for the origin of this exquisite microtubule
sensitivity. (ii) Using biophysical approaches we developed to remove and exert forces on kinetochores in vivo,
we will define the mechanisms giving rise to the kinetochore’s specialized, strong and dynamic grip.
 Together, this will provide a framework for understanding, targeting, and rewiring the physical
processes of chromosome segregation for both basic and therapeutic purposes. This proposal is innovative in
that it tests new hypotheses about the connection between molecular and cellular-scale events, and provides
new tools for rewiring molecular-scale forces and assemblies and directly probing mechanics inside dividing
mammalian cells. More broadly, this work will serve as a platform for understanding the emergent architecture,
mechanics and computation of diverse macromolecular machines."

Chromatin, the assemblage of protein, DNA and RNA that represents the physiologic form of the
eukaryotic genome, imposes a million-fold length-scale compaction to fit DNA in the nucleus.
Rather than serving as mere static packaging, chromatin structure acts as a dynamic regulator
of underlying DNA function. Local chromatin structure may be stable for decades, yet is
sufficiently dynamic to respond to signaling pathways, potentiating transcriptional program
changes in development, disease, and environmental changes. Indeed, cellular identity and
changes thereof are intimately connected to chromatin states-- keeping a neuron a neuron and
not a liver cell. Apart from DNA sequence-specific transcription factors, the information carriers
responsible for this structural variation are chemical modifications to the genome itself and
attendant histone proteins involved in packaging (often referred to as “epigenetic” marks), as
well as noncoding RNA acting at the chromatin interface. Although little known about these
epigenetic information carriers, it is clear that they play crucial roles in development, cognition
and disease. Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms by which epigenetic information carriers
impact chromatin structure and function, particularly in the context of transcriptional activation is
the unifying theme of the Ruthenburg lab. In the next four years, we will discover and
characterize the detailed mechanisms of new epigenetic information carriers, focusing on
nucleosome-level variation and orphaned histone modifications, defining binding partners for
recently appreciated DNA modifications and their function, and performing detailed mechanistic
characterization of a class of molecules we discovered--chromatin-enriched noncoding RNA that
act as local transcriptional activators. In addition, we will biochemically define the function of
RNA in the MLL/SET1 family of histone modification complexes and its functional consequences
in cellular contexts. Our interdisciplinary work in these areas will require the development of new
tools and experimental approaches—our outstanding track record of pioneering tool
development with NIGMS funding makes the case that future efforts will meet with similar
success. The fundamental mechanistic understanding of epigenetic information systems we will
develop through these avenues will impact our understanding of nuclear function and its
dysregulation in disease."

Telomeres ensure genome integrity by facilitating chromosome end replication through
telomerase, the activity of which enables cellular proliferation. Uncontrolled proliferation as may
occur in cancer cells requires hyper-activation of telomere-extension activity. Conversely, lack of
telomere extension results in degenerative disorders or premature aging. Critical to telomere
structure and function, the conserved multifunctional shelterin complex associates with
telomeres to coordinate multiple telomere activities. The long-term objective of our NIGMS
MIRA research program is to determine, at the atomic resolution, molecular mechanisms of
telomere length homeostasis through comprehensive biochemical, structural, and functional
characterizations of the telomeric shelterin complex, shelterin-telomerase interactions, and
telomerase biogenesis. Mutations in telomerase subunits or shelterin components have been
increasingly linked to cancer and premature aging. Shelterin complex and shelterin-telomerase
interactions play essential roles in regulating synthesis of telomeric DNA repeats and defining
telomere lengths that support or restrict cell proliferation. Our recent efforts have achieved the
conceptual advancement on the role of shelterin bridge, rather than individual shelterin
component per se, in regulating telomere length and the landmark determination of the atomic
views of shelterin bridge assembly process by x-ray crystallography. Our accumulated
expertise and prior success position us to deepen our investigations. In the next five years, we
aim to address the following three fundamental questions in the field: 1) Elucidate the
biochemical and structural basis of the assembly of whole fission yeast shelterin complex and
its role in telomere length control; 2) Determine the mechanistic basis of shelterin disassembly;
3) Determine the structural basis of telomerase RNA folding quality control mechanism by Pof8
complex. Accomplishment of the proposed studies will provide new and significant mechanistic
insights into the maintenance of our chromosome ends and set up the foundation for the
development of new therapeutic approaches against diseases caused by telomere dysfunction,
such as premature aging."

 Circadian clocks play fundamental roles in regulating essential cellular and physiological processes. The
mammalian clock is comprised of cell-autonomous oscillators orchestrated by the hypothalamic
suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) to perform tissue and systemic functions. More than a dozen core components
of the oscillator have been identified; however, significant knowledge gaps remain regarding regulatory
mechanisms/components and tissue-specific functions in the clock system. My previous research has provided
important insights into mammalian circadian rhythms. For example, I generated Per2::Luc reporter mice which
proved to be a powerful reagent ubiquitously employed in the clock field. We recently reported a second-
generation reporter mouse line, Per2::LucSV, and demonstrated a novel miRNA regulation of PER2
accumulation and a positive role of PER2 in its own transcription. Most relevant to the current MIRA
application, I have been interested in combining mouse forward genetic screening and mechanistic studies to
probe fundamental clock functions. Previously we reported the identification by mouse screening and
mechanistic dissection of two antagonistic E3 ligase, FBXL3 and FBXL21 in circadian period regulation. More
recently, we uncovered a GSK-3beta-FBXL21 regulatory cascade controlling rhythmic degradation of the
sarcomere protein TCAP and skeletal muscle function. Building on these prior studies, the current proposal
aims to determine tissue-specific circadian mechanisms of FBXL21 and to identify novel clock components
from a streamlined mouse screening. We will examine new targets and functions of FBXL21 in striated
muscles including skeletal and cardiac muscles, focusing on proteostasis and myogenic differentiation.
Leveraging expertise in mouse forward genetic screening, I recently performed a genetic screening for
dominant phenotypes using an efficient breeding/phenotyping scheme. Whole-exome sequencing and variant
analysis pinpointed a novel circadian mutant line with a lengthened circadian wheel-running period and age-
dependent neurodegeneration. We will identify this new genetic component of the clock and characterize the
underlying regulatory mechanisms. Overall, these studies promise to discover important mechanisms and
functions of circadian rhythms in mammals. I have established an integrative research capability combining
mouse genetics and phenotyping, biochemical/molecular/cellular studies, imaging methodologies, and omics
platforms, complemented by expertise from a broad network of collaborators. These together form an excellent
foundation for the proposed research. The ultimate goal is to understand how biological timing governs bodily
function and what we can do to safeguard our health by optimizing our natural clock."

Cell fate engineering, for example the directed differentiation of pluripotent stem cells, holds great promise for
disease modeling, drug screening, and regenerative medicine. However, our ability to engineering cell fate with
fidelity has been impeded by an incomplete understanding of inter- and intracellular networks that govern
differentiation, and by the lack of adequate computational tools to distill testable hypothesis from the mountains
of data coming from single cell omics technologies. In the parent award of this grant, we are addressing the
following unanswered questions and unmet challenges that emerged from our prior work. First, we are
extending our computational methods that assess the outcomes of cell fate engineering to more data types,
thus increasing the comprehensiveness of their results. Second, we are substantially improving and extending
our regulatory network tools so that they are statistically calibrated and so that they can ingest chromatin
accessibility and expression data simultaneously to discover binding site motifs of orphan transcription factors.
Third, we are devising computational methods to generate reliable cell fate engineering recipes that account
for not only transcriptional networks but also how signaling pathways inform them, and that account for
temporal dynamics. The Imaging system that we are requesting in this supplement grant is crucial for us to
experimentally assess the predictions that emerge from our computational algorithms to improve the directed
differentiation of pluripotent stem cells to, first, mesoderm sub-types, and second, to articular chondrocytes.
Meeting these goals will shed light on how signaling pathways and intracellular regulatory networks interact
during differentiation, and it will help to make cell fate engineering more reliable and controllable."

Given the over-abundance of food in modern society, it is easy to lose sight of the importance of
feeding to animals in nature. For most animals, food is extremely scarce and being wise to
opportunities to eat is essential for survival. As such, the circadian system has evolved to
receive a number of different stimuli—i.e., light, temperature, food, and even fear—to keep
biological processes coordinated and allow for adaptation to ever changing conditions. The
ability to tell time relative to feeding has a long history of research, going back more than one
hundred years hundred years with behavioral observations of honeybees and rats. However, the
neural circuitry behind adaptation of behavior to timed feeding has continually escaped our
grasp. In this project, I will utilize conditional genetics, viral restorations, and chemogenetic tools
to identify the dopamine population (both anatomically and genetically) that is required for the
behavioral expression of food anticipatory activity in lab mice. From here, we will build out a
more comprehensive characterization of how a select population of dopamine neurons
projecting to the striatum can inform the time keeping systems of the brain that food is available."

Ependymal motile cilia are responsible for the coordinated movement of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) along the
ventricle wall. The synchronized activity of ependymal cilia creates specific flow networks that are regulated by
behavioral state. Ependymal cilia motility can be controlled by specific compounds in the CSF to adjust fluid
flow, but little is known about the molecular and cellular mechanisms of this regulation. We propose the
hypothesis that G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling pathways are expressed and function within
ependymal cilia to modulate ciliary beat frequency. The focus of this proposal is to define the complement of
signaling receptors that localize to ependymal cilia and determine how GPCR activation impacts cilia beating
and activity-dependent ciliary localization of regulatory signaling proteins. As proof of principle, the GPCR
melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) receptor 1 localizes to ependymal motile cilia and we find that the
GPCR signaling protein β-arrestin moves into ependymal cilia in response to MCH treatment. To assess which
other GPCRs and signaling proteins are localized to motile cilia in ependymal cells, we will perform proximity
labeling in normal and Bardet-Biedl syndrome protein deficient ependymal cells to identify low abundance and
transient ciliary signaling proteins. We will also employ pharmacological approaches to evaluate the role of
potential ciliary GPCRs in the regulation of ependymal cilia beating. Finally, we will assess potential ciliary
GPCR activation and signaling by defining the spatial organization of GPCRs, β-arrestin, and the signaling
chaperone Bbs4 within and proximal to the ciliary compartment prior to and after GPCR agonist addition. In
order to provide the necessary resolution to define the precise spatial organization, we will use expansion
microscopy, which is a cutting-edge imaging technique. The outcomes of this work will provide critical insight
into the sensory and signaling functions of ependymal motile cilia and lay the foundation to create new tools to
control ependymal cilia activity and discern the role of ependymal cilia in the mature brain."

HIV infection of the central nervous system (CNS) occurs in a majority of HIV-infected individuals. It causes HIV-
associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) even in the era of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). There are
currently no therapies for HAND. We have focused on HIV infection and pathogenesis in the CNS over the past 25 years.
Our studies have helped establish cell-free and cell-cell contact-mediated HIV infection of astrocytes and a critical role of
HIV Tat protein in HIV neuropathogenesis. The latter includes the creation of doxycycline-inducible brain-specific HIV
Tat transgenic mice (iTat) as an important surrogate HAND model. We have recently uncovered that activation of α7
nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) by its positive allosteric modulator (PAM) PNU-120596 ameliorates HAND
neurology and neuropathology using the iTat model, suggesting the therapeutic potential of α7 nAChR PAM against
HAND. These studies are significant because Tat protein continues to be detected in the brain of HIV-infected individuals
treated with cART. In addition, we have shown that α7 nAChR PAM inhibits HIV replication and reactivation. These
findings undoubtedly call for further characterization of the mechanisms of α7 nAChR PAM-mediated neuroprotection
against Tat neurotoxicity and the mechanisms by which α7 nAChR PAM activation leads to inhibition of HIV replication
and reactivation. The central hypothesis for this proposal is that α7 nAChR PAM hold great promise as cART adjunctive
therapeutics to treat HIV neuropathogenesis and HAND. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following three
interrelated specific aims: (1) To further characterize the mechanisms of α7 nAChR/PAM-mediated neuroprotection
against Tat neurotoxicity; (2) To define the mechanisms of α7 nAChR/PAM-mediated inhibition of HIV replication and
latent HIV reactivation; and (3) To determine the in vivo effects of α7 nAChR/PAM activation on HIV neuropathogenesis
and HIV replication and latency in the CNS and periphery. We will use a combined molecular, cellular, biochemical, and
genetic approach, including the use of primary mouse and human cultures, iTat mice and α7 nAChR knockout mice, the
infectious and replication-competent EcoHIV model, and single nucleus advanced genomics technologies. The answers
sought have fundamental significance for our understanding of not only this critical and pervasive protein HIV Tat and its
role in HIV neuropathogenesis but also the molecular mechanisms of HIV transcription inhibition by α7 nAChR/PAM
activation. The findings from the proposed studies are expected to provide mechanistic and pre-clinical evidence to
support the use of α7 nAChR PAM as HAND therapeutics and inform a new intervention strategy for HIV
neuropathogenesis. The enormous amount of information available on HIV Tat, HIV infection and pathogenesis of the
CNS, and the roles of α7 nAChR/PAM in other neurodegenerative diseases, and the results obtained from our recent
studies make the accomplishment of these aims practical."

Language is vital to much, if not all, aspects of a person’s life. For those persons with aphasia (PWA), a
language disorder, the impact of aphasia extends beyond the language impairment to cognition, participation,
and psychosocial aspects. To address the needs of PWA, historically two conceptualizations of aphasia and
approaches to rehabilitation have emerged in the field: impairment-focused and life participation. The
impairment-focused approach puts prominence on language impairment, and more recently also underlying
cognitive impairments that impact language processing. The life participation approach puts prominence on
participation goals, and the environment and psychosocial needs of the person to reach their goals. The field of
clinical aphasiology has long recognized the importance of both approaches; however, there remains no
quantitative model to determine the degree of interactivity and relative impact of impairment and life
participation variables in PWA at assessment. This lack of model limits the ability to make informed decisions
about what to target in aphasia rehabilitation. The long-term goal of this proposal is to develop a complexity
model of aphasia to transform conceptualization and rehabilitation of aphasia that maximally improves both the
aphasia (impairment) and its impact (participation) in a parsimonious and efficient way. The central
hypothesis of this project is that impairment variables (e.g., comprehension and naming ability) and life
participation variables (e.g., mental health, social roles and activities) influence each other in complex ways.
The use of cutting-edge, data-driven techniques from complex systems science will provide a way to model the
constellation of relationships between impairment and life participation variables, with the ability to identify
central variables and clusters of variables that are tightly connected (Aim 1). Furthermore, these techniques
will provide a method to detect putative causal relationships between variables (e.g., naming impairment
causes lower communication confidence), which is a critical need in clinical aphasiology research where
sample sizes are relatively small, and large randomized controlled trials are not always feasible (Aim 2). Lastly,
the prognostic value of the complexity model of aphasia will be investigated by testing whether the most central
and causal variables from the model predict post-treatment outcomes (Aim 3). This project benefits from
leveraging a large existing dataset of PWA (n = 61) who participated in Intensive Comprehensive Aphasia
Programs (ICAPs) between the years 2016-2024. The use of the ICAPs data is critical for capturing measures
of both aphasia approaches at assessment. By the accomplishing the Aims of this project, a foundational
model will be established from which future work will a) expand the complexity aphasia model to include brain
structure and function data – a critical set of variables given the leading cause of aphasia is stroke – and b)
develop idiographic (i.e., individual-level) complexity models of aphasia for precision medicine."
11042979,"The University of Wisconsin Eau Claire – Mayo Clinic Regenerative Neuroscience Scholars (ReNS) Program
combines the strengths of two complementary institutions committed to supporting student diversity to enable
undergraduates from backgrounds underrepresented in STEM careers (e.g. students of color, students with
disabilities, socioeconomic disadvantage, educational disadvantage) to pursue careers involving research and
Ph.D. training in regenerative neuroscience. UWEC is an undergraduate-focused public state university with
demonstrated excellence in undergraduate research. Mayo Clinic is a world-renowned research organization
and a growing leader in regenerative neuroscience research and training. UWEC and Mayo Clinic have a master
collaborative research agreement, which enables highly coordinated institutional support of this program. The
goals of the ReNS Program are to (1) enable top-quality summer undergraduate research experiences for
students that result in presentations at national conferences and publications, (2) cultivate a curriculum of content
and skills training that supports the success of students in careers in research and Ph.D. training, and (3) promote
supportive mentoring and professional relationship building of students. Based on a proactive recruitment
strategy to connect with first-and second-year students and prospective students, the program recruits cohorts
of 6 students per year for training in research through a spring seminar course at UWEC, a summer research
experience in the Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) program at Mayo Clinic Rochester,
subsequent presentation of their research in multiple conference settings, and long-term support of career
development. The academic curriculum focuses on advancing skills related to research and promoting
professional development and personal identity as a scientist. The research training focuses on developing
laboratory skills and scientific thinking along with creating scientific products (conference presentations,
publications). Mentoring is central to the program; students have mentoring in research with Mayo Clinic faculty,
near-peer mentoring from researchers from diverse backgrounds (postbaccalaureate/graduate students) at
Mayo Clinic, and role model mentoring from UWEC alumni scientists and neuroscientists from diverse
backgrounds through videoconferencing and informational interviews. The program is supported by 2 advisory
committees focused on integral components of program success (recruitment and student success (RSS),
mentoring). With the input of an expert evaluator of STEM diversity initiatives and the advisory committees, the
ReNS program maximizes student success toward successful careers in research and Ph.D. training in
regenerative neuroscience."
11042133,"There is an acute and urgent need to develop new and effective pharmacological interventions for
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as there are currently only two FDA-approved medications for the
treatment of PTSD (both of which are from the same drug class and have shown only moderate effect sizes in
FDA registration trials). Many Veterans with PTSD thus remain symptomatic despite the availability of these
treatments, increasing the likelihood of receiving pharmacological treatment interventions for which there is
little or no empirical evidence. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) utilizing new medication approaches are
thus acutely needed in the Iraq/Afghanistan-era Veteran population, a cohort that may be less treatment-
refractory (particularly if treated early in the course of PTSD symptom development). The investigation of
promising pharmacological agents for this Veteran cohort could thus not be more timely or urgent.
Increasing evidence supports a potential role for neurosteroids in the neurobiology and treatment of PTSD. For
example, allopregnanolone (a downstream metabolite of pregnenolone) has anxiolytic, antidepressant, anti-
aggressive, fear-reductive, neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and neurogenesis-enhancing actions – and
these properties could have clear therapeutic utility for PTSD. Our preliminary data also demonstrate that
serum allopregnanolone levels are significantly decreased in patients with PTSD compared to control
participants in two independent cohorts. We have shown in multiple studies that pregnenolone administration
elevates downstream allopregnanolone levels 5-10 fold, and can thus potentially serve as a precursor loading
strategy to restore deficient allopregnanolone levels in PTSD. Furthermore, recent neuroimaging studies
demonstrate that allopregnanolone plays a role in the modulation of brain function associated with negative
emotion, and enhances activity associated with emotional regulatory processes (Sripada, 2013; Priority
Communication, Biological Psychiatry). In addition, our preclinical rodent models demonstrate that pre-
treatment with pregnenolone mitigates anxiety-like behaviors in rodents following predator stress exposure.
Finally, we have demonstrated that PTSD symptoms improve in Veterans with mild Traumatic Brain injury
(mTBI) following administration of pregnenolone in both a pilot RCT and in a larger follow-up RCT in mTBI. In
both studies, Veterans with mTBI randomized to pregnenolone showed marked elevations in serum
allopregnanolone and pregnenolone levels post-treatment. A precursor loading strategy to enhance deficient
levels of endogenous allopregnanolone may thus be an efficacious treatment for PTSD. We therefore propose:
 1.) To investigate the potential efficacy of pregnenolone to treat PTSD in Iraq/Afghanistan-era Veterans by
conducting an RCT of pregnenolone vs. placebo (primary endpoint CAPS-5 change; [90 randomized
 participants; n=45 per group;] 8-week duration of treatment),
2.) To determine if pregnenolone also improves co-occurring pain and depression symptoms (secondary
 endpoints Brief Pain Inventory and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale),
3.) To quantify serum neurosteroid levels at baseline and post-treatment to determine if pregnenolone and
downstream neurosteroid metabolites such as allopregnanolone (and other biomarker candidates such
as inflammatory markers) are predictors of therapeutic response.
Results of the proposed RCT could provide the scientific foundation for the potential efficacy of pregnenolone
in PTSD and lead to a pivotal Phase III study. Clinical and preclinical data support the possible therapeutic
utility of pregnenolone for PTSD symptoms, pain disorders, and depression, and pregnenolone has been very
well-tolerated in Veteran cohorts to date. Treatment with pregnenolone could thus represent a promising new
intervention in PTSD that is efficacious, inexpensive, and safe in Iraq/Afghanistan-era Veterans."

Understanding how T cell receptors (TCRs) see tumor antigens presented by MHCs is necessary to fully
understand how the immune system recognizes tumor antigens, and to reap the full potential of antigen-specific
immunotherapy. To achieve this goal, a quantum leap forward is required in which the revolutionary advances in
machine learning are combined with a large volume of structure, function, data on matched TCR-pMHC pairs.
The development of accurate predictors of TCR-antigen recognition will be dependent on the creation and
integration sequencing-based datasets with high-throughput structural and functional insights. Our proposal,
submitted as a CRUK/NCI Grand Challenge team (MATCHMAKERS) will combine researchers with expertise in
immunology, methods development, structural biology, and computation to enable generalized prediction and
design of TCR recognition. This work will be spread across four Work Packages (WPs):
WP1: Large-scale generation of TCR-pMHC pairs from naturally occurring sources. We will build datasets of
naturally occurring TCR-pMHC pairs. Our team will use an array of approaches to collect these datasets, from
humans and from mouse models, and in the context of both cancer and immunity more generally.
WP2: Ultra-high throughput TCR-pMHC matching using molecular engineering. Efforts to create general models
will require a broader array of data than feasible to collect from natural TCR systems. We will use an array of
synthetic approaches developed by our team to comprehensively match TCRs with pMHCs to train
computational models.
WP3: Large-scale structural and biochemical analyses of TCR-pMHC interactions. A key to our team’s vision is
to match interaction datasets with high throughput structural and functional insights. A deep understanding of
how the TCR contacts with MHC helices control function and orientation will be essential for training and testing
computational models.
WP4 AI-based prediction and design of TCR-pMHC interactions. We will integrate our data to train next-
generation algorithms capable of generally predicting and designing TCR-pMHC interactions. These predictions
will proceed through a reiterative testing and feedback circuits for further model optimization."
11043058,"Project Summary
Horizontal gene transfer (HGT), specifically plasmid conjugation, is a driving force in microbial evolution
and pathogenesis. The process of conjugation appears deceptively simple: a donor cell transfers a copy
of a plasmid to a compatible recipient cell through a physical mating bridge. In doing so, diverse traits,
such as metabolic, virulence, and antibiotic resistance genes, can be spread. As such, HGT has been
implicated in a variety of human health and industrial applications, ranging from multi-drug resistance to
bioremediation. Advances in microbiome studies have revealed that HGT occurs between both closely
and distantly related strains, yielding a wide diversity of potential strain/plasmid combinations; despite
this, epidemiological surveillance clearly demonstrates that only a small minority of clones and their
associated plasmids persist in situ and are highly conserved across different ecological, geographical,
and clinical contexts. Thus, it is widely believed that the overall fitness of individual strain-plasmid pairs
is a key feature of successful pathogens. Fundamentally, this success is driven by a dynamic interaction
between a plasmid-carrying donor and suitable recipient strain in a favorable environment, resulting in
the formation of new strain-plasmid pairs (e.g., transconjugants). However, research to date has primarily
focused on established strain-plasmid combinations (e.g., donor capabilities and/or plasmid fitness
costs); in contrast, the dynamics and factors favoring the initial formation of these combinations
are entirely unknown. Yet, such information is critical to both predict new pathogen emergence and
develop strategies that intervene in plasmid acquisition before they become established in a population.
To address this gap, my research program leverages our unique interdisciplinary expertise in
computational modeling, bioinformatics, and mechanistic experiments to investigate the molecular
factors favoring the formation of new strain-plasmid combinations. Our proposed themes approach this
problem from three complementary perspectives: (1) What genetic features make certain plasmids
harder/easier to acquire? (2) What determines a strain’s potential to act as a good HGT recipient? (3)
How does environmental selection impact plasmid acquisition capabilities? Combined, these parallel
objectives work towards a unified framework that integrates insights across multiple levels of complexity
(i.e., molecular to ecological/evolutionary). These research directions contribute to our long-term goal,
one that is central to the NIGMS mission, of reliably predicting (and ultimately controlling) clinically
relevant strain/plasmid prevalence, and will eventually enable us to anticipate pathogen emergence a
priori and explore downstream applications, e.g., novel antibiotic treatment strategies."
11043154,"Abstract
Volumetric Muscle Loss (VML) is a pervasive clinical challenge with poor functional outcomes and long-term
pain even after gold standard autograft treatment. Currently there is a poor understanding of mechanisms and
root cause of pain after VML beyond the observation that patients are commonly afflicted with long-term pain.
The overall goal of the parent grant is to define the critical roles of immune and FAP cells in VML injury and
repair and to develop newly engineered immunomodulatory and regenerative treatment strategies that will
provide a foundation to translate into clinical treatments for VML. The initial grant proposed to focus on
developing novel immunomodulatory and regenerative therapies and to measure muscle and limb function after
regeneration. The overall research goal of this supplement proposal is to expand on the current Aims and to
evaluate changes in pain, sensory neurons and immune mechanisms of pain after VML. We will further assess
whether novel immunomodulatory and stem cell therapies are able to reduce long term pain after VML. To
expand the evaluations of limb function and pain we propose to incorporate assessments of tactile allodynia in
the limbs of the mice using Von Frey filaments, and dynamic weight bearing to measure load distribution on each
limb. Sensory neurons innervation of the muscle will be evaluated by staining sections for CGRP, NF200, and
TRPV1. We will also assess the neurological changes that often lead to chronic pain by marking afferent neurons
in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Immune cells in the DRG will be assessed by spectral flow cytometry for
neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, and T-cells. Lastly we will expand on immune mechanisms of pain by
including new assessments of lipid mediator biosynthesis via LC-MS-based lipidomics from the muscle and
DRG. The overall research outcomes of the proposed supplementary work will: 1) generate preliminary data to
motivate the use of PEG-MAL resolving delivery for chronic musculoskeletal pain applications, and 2) expand
research capacity and measurements of the current work to include new measures of pain and sensory neuron
function and inflammation. The proposed work will have a significant impact on the understanding of pain after
VML injury and the development of new therapeutic approaches to resolve chronic pain in VML patients. This
award supplement will additionally provide research and career development training to promote diversity in
health-related research. The proposed neuroscience graduate student, Dominique Granville, will receive training
in: peripheral nerve sensory mechanisms, musculoskeletal trauma models, pre-clinical pain sensitization and
behavioral metrics, DRG isolation, histology and flow cytometry, biomaterial fabrication, and lipid mediator
lipidomics analyses; as well as training through an individualized development plan, research and career
diversity seminars and workshops, attending and presenting at conferences, and career coaching."

 Childhood growth disorders have significant consequences in adult life, including body size, work and
reproductive performance, and the risk of chronic diseases. Our long-term goal is to understand the molecular
mechanisms underlying childhood growth disorders and translate this knowledge into novel therapeutic
strategies. Given the physiological similarities between humans and mice, studying mouse mutants has provided
us with fundamental insights. However, there are critical gaps in our understanding of growth disorders in mice,
including the redundancy of genes involved in normal growth and development, as well as the unknown critical
genes. To address these gaps, we utilized a mouse forward genetic screen platform with automated meiotic
mapping to identify mutations causing growth disorders rapidly and unbiasedly. In previous studies, we identified
a null allele of Kbtbd2 called “teeny”, which exhibited severe insulin resistance, lipodystrophy, fatty liver, and
growth retardation. Our research uncovered the crucial role of KBTBD2 in regulating insulin signaling in adipose
tissues, contributing to most of the metabolic phenotypes observed in teeny mice. However, the cause of growth
retardation in teeny mice is still unknown. In this proposal, through knock-out of Kbtbd2 and osteogenic
differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs), we discovered an intrinsic role of
KBTBD2 in regulating osteogenesis by targeting p85α, the regulatory subunit of PI3K and a key downstream
node of IGF-1 signaling. Interestingly, the teeny phenotype closely resembles SHORT syndrome, a genetic
disorder caused by mutations in the PIK3R1 gene, encoding p85α and related isoforms. We found that the
recurrent R649W mutation in p85α disrupted its interaction with KBTBD2, resulting in decreased ubiquitination
and degradation of p85α by KBTBD2. Based on these results, our central hypothesis is that KBTBD2 regulates
the abundance of p85α to enable IGF-1 signaling activation during osteogenesis, and the p85α R649W mutation
leads to SHORT syndrome due to reduced association with the KBTBD2 protein. To test this hypothesis, we
propose two specific aims. Aim 1 will elucidate the molecular mechanism of KBTBD2 in bone development. Aim
2 will investigate the role of KBTBD2 in the pathogenesis of SHORT syndrome. Completion of the proposed work
will provide a comprehensive understanding of KBTBD2's role in skeletal development. As the KBTBD2 protein
is highly conserved between mice and humans and the p85α mutant disrupts the normal function of KBTBD2 in
SHORT syndrome, our study may yield new therapeutic strategies for treating childhood growth disorders in the
future."

A critical issue for understanding sleep function is whether and how it impacts the accuracy of neuronal
network computations to improve behavioral performance. Indeed, studies over the past several decades have
shown that even brief periods of rest are correlated with subsequent improved perceptual and cognitive
performance. However, despite the prevalence and beneficial impact of sleep on behavioral performance, little
is known about the neural mechanisms of this improvement. We propose new studies to explore unchartered
territory: we will explore the beneficial impact of sleep on information coding across cortical circuits and on
perceptual performance. We propose to use multiple-electrode recordings simultaneously in three cortical
areas, early and mid-level visual cortex (areas V1 and V4) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (area dlPFC) to
examine, for the first time, the dynamics and coding in neuronal populations before, during, and after sleep,
and their impact on behavioral performance. In Aim 1, we will investigate whether the low-frequency
synchronization of network activity ubiquitously observed during slow-wave sleep is associated with a post-
sleep reduction in the degree of synchronized fluctuations of population activity in visual and prefrontal cortex.
In Aim 2, we will use electrical stimulation during quiet wakefulness to emulate the restorative effects of sleep
in the absence of sleep, and causally test our hypothesis in Aim 1 that slow-wave population activity during
sleep causes a reduction in synchronized fluctuations in population activity after sleep. This Aim will provide
proof of concept for invasive stimulation procedures to improve perceptual performance in the absence of
sleep, and will set the stage for future noninvasive procedures in humans. In Aim 3, we will use optogenetic
stimulation to test the mechanism of the sleep-dependent improvement in neuronal and behavioral
performance. We hypothesize that sleep is associated with increased synaptic efficacy in local circuits that
persists during post-sleep wakefulness. We further hypothesize that this increase in synaptic efficacy elevates
firing rates and spike timing coordination between neurons after sleep to improve the accuracy of encoding
information in population activity. Our research has the potential to advance our understanding of the neural
mechanisms underlying sleep and thus provide future solutions to ameliorate the detrimental effects of sleep
disorder on cognitive performance, including practical applications for non-invasive neuronal prosthetic
devices."
11039429,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Chromatin modifiers and transcription factors regulating neuronal development are strongly implicated in autism
spectrum disorders (ASD). ASH1L encodes a histone methyl transferase that activates developmental gene
transcription. Despite being a high-confidence ASD risk gene, ASH1L- targets and functional mechanisms that
underlie neurodevelopmental disorders are unknown. Our preliminary data indicates that ASH1L regulates brain
development, neuronal arborization and synaptic function in human cortical excitatory neurons. Our data further
suggests that during neuronal development, ASH1L antagonizes the repressor activity of Polycomb repressor
complex 2 (PRC2), thereby de-repressing PRC2 target genes that are themselves high-risk ASD genes (e.g.,
FOXP1, RIMS1, and NRXN1α). Both ASH1L and PRC2 have been associated with the control of neuronal ar-
borization and are broadly express in the developing brain. However, the extent to which the ASH1L/PRC2 axis
modulate cell fate transitions and cell type specific gene programs in the human developing brain is a gap in
knowledge. Our central hypothesis is that ASH1L counteracts PRC2 activity to orchestrate neuronal de-
velopment by modulating cell lineage decisions and gene programs that are cell type specific. We will
leverage brain organoid technology and extend the original focus of the parent grant to define how the
ASH1L/PRC2 axis modulates cell fate transitions and cell type specific gene programs that will be relevant to
ASD pathogenesis using human brain organoids. Specifically, we will: (1) Define how the ASH1L/PRC2 axis
impacts cell fate transitions in human brain organoids and (2) Define cell type specific transcriptional programs
that are modulated by the ASH1L/PRC2 axis. Completion of these aims will expand the current focus of the
parent grant and will provide pre-clinical evidence and rationale for mechanism-based therapeutics.
Additionally, in response to NOT-OD-24-001 we propose the following DEI activities as part of this adminis-
trative supplement: (1) A high school outreach program which targets students from diverse backgrounds at
the center for translational neuroscience in Brown University (see DEI statement). Our goal for this summer
program is to contribute to the diversification of the pipeline of trainees to STEM careers. This program will
provide exposure to scientific communication, experimental science and career development activities (see DEI
statement); and (2) Direct research mentoring and career development of trainees from underserve populations
(2 postbaccalaurate students, 1 undergraduate student and 1 research staff). This training will help them pursue
careers in biomedical research by providing training in critical thinking, data analysis, scientific writing and sci-
entific communication skills, along with opportunities to present their research at national conferences and pub-
lish their work in peer review publications."

Dental Caries is one of the most common chronic diseases worldwide, and one of the most understudied
conditions in patients with rare diseases, critically undervalued in healthcare. The high prevalence of dental
caries emphasizes the imperative need for studies focused on understanding host susceptibility, to deliver more
efficient prevention strategies tailored to each individual. Over the last decade, human genetic studies have
made significant progress in identifying genetic risk factors associated with dental caries susceptibility,
occurrence, and progression. Nevertheless, there is no follow-up on genome-wide association studies (GWAS)
that identified dental caries risk genes, including those coding for transcription factors as dental caries risk loci.
Recently, the candidate’s research has demonstrated that deficiency of the mineralization-regulating
transcription factor Trps1 in odontoblasts —the cells that form dentin—compromises the quality of dental tissues
and increases susceptibility to dental caries. However, further studies are required to elucidate the role of Trps1
in dentinogenesis and its effect on enamel, to explain the higher predisposition of these tissues to acid-induced
demineralization. This project builds upon the clinical findings of the increased susceptibility of dental caries in
patients with heterozygous mutations in the TRPS1 gene coding for the TRPS1 transcription factor (OMIM
190350). The specific aims of this proposal are to (i) determine the mechanism whereby Trps1 regulates
communication between developing odontoblasts/ameloblasts and the formation of mantle dentin, as well as to
(ii) identify genes and cellular processes dysregulated in the tooth due to Trps1 deficiency in odontoblasts. The
experimental design employs Trps1 conditional knockout mice and uses advanced methodology to assess
mineralized dental tissues and global changes of gene expression in dentin and enamel-forming cells.
Specifically, we will (i) determine the effect of Trps1 on the micro- and nanomorphology of dentin and enamel
including dentino-enamel junction, (ii) assess the role of Trps1 in formation of mantle dentin (essential to support
the overlying enamel layer), (iii) assess whether Trps1 regulates the Wnt signaling pathway implicated in
molecular communication between developing odontoblasts/ameloblasts and (iv) determine consequences of
odontoblast- specific Trps1 deficiency on global changes of gene expression in ameloblasts and odontoblasts.
This proposal constitutes a proof-of-concept of the importance of transcription factors in susceptibility to dental
caries. A fundamental understanding of the transcriptional regulation of the formation and mineralization of dental
tissues, as well as the crosstalk between odontoblasts/ameloblasts, will result in opportunities to develop better
options for prevention of dental caries and for the identification of high-risk groups with developmental defects
of dental tissues. The results of these studies will improve our knowledge of the basic processes involved in the
formation of the dentin-enamel interface and will also lead to personalized healthcare and the identification of
targets required for the development of new advanced materials and/or procedures for mineralized tissue repair."

The microbiome has become an essential element of biomedical science as recent research has uncovered the connection
between human microbiome composition, diet, environment, and the incidence of a wide variety of the most
serious and life-threatening human health conditions, such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, autoimmune disorders,
musculoskeletal diseases, and antibiotic resistance. Despite knowledge of these critical connections, research on effective
microbiome-based treatments for health problems is still in its infancy and there is vast untapped potential for
groundbreaking discoveries. Teaching K-12 students about the biomedical science behind the microbiome, diet, and
environment that are directly relevant to their everyday lives therefore has the potential to increase their interest in
biomedical science, develop quantitative and computational problem-solving skills essential for biomedical research,
and empower them to play a role in disseminating biomedical science via public health advocacy. Exposure to such
education is especially critical at the high school level when students are contemplating future career paths.
To meet this critical need, SIFT, Colby College, and Jackson Labs propose Gut Grieff, a low-cost, web-based digital
game that teaches high school students to think about genomics quantitatively, computationally, and predictively through
active engagement, strategic problem-solving, and customized feedback emulating how high school biology instructors
teach their students. Non-violent gameplay and educational content relevant to students' everyday lives present an
inclusive environment designed to appeal to students regardless of their experiences playing games.
Phase I of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will produce a low-fidelity prototype with tasks
demonstrating specific game mechanics designed to teach core genomics concepts: healthy microbiome composition;
species interdependence, including the host; influence of biotic and abiotic factors; and strategies for maintaining
healthy microbiome (Aim 1, Sub Aim 1 ). The Gut Grieff prototype will also include a cutting-edge artificial intelligence
(Al) system that monitors player performance and appropriately modifies game content to improve learning outcomes
(Aim 1, Sub Aim 2). Gut Grief!'s low-fidelity prototype will be evaluated in terms of usability (Aim 2) and its efficacy at
teaching microbiome concepts, engaging the learner, and increasing students' interest in biomedical science (Aim 3).
Gut Grieff will be the first scalable, game-based, and adaptive biomedical education tool targeting the microbiome
and promoting transfer of in-game learning to traditional biology assessments. Gut Grieff will be a web-based game,
allowing easy set up and scalability regardless of individual computers' capabilities. Making Gut Grieff commercially
available to high schools, outreach organizations, and the general public has the potential to disseminate biomedical
science knowledge, increase students' interest in biomedical science, and give students of all backgrounds the
quantitative and computational problem-solving skills needed for future careers in biomedical science."
10922338,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Blood coagulation is a complex process that involves a balance of plasma proteins and platelets. A slight
imbalance in any one of these can cause life-threatening bleeding or clotting. Current treatments for bleeding
disorders such as hemophilia include recombinant or plasma-derived factor replacement therapies, factor
mimetic therapies, and bypassing agents, but they can cause serious side effects and cost in excess of
$1,000,000 per patient per year. Effectively dosing a treatment for hemophilia is often problematic due to the
narrow therapeutic window between bleeding and coagulation, numerous food and drug interactions, and high
variability in dose response in different people. Patients require frequent monitoring of the coagulation status,
however, there is no single test currently available to provide comprehensive information about coagulation in a
convenient way, and existing tests are not as helpful for modern hemophilia treatments as they are for previously
gold-standard treatments.
Our revolutionary acoustic tweezing platform has the capability to simultaneously measure early,
intermediate, and late stages of coagulation and requires only a single drop of whole blood per test. The platform
utilizes acoustic levitation to manipulate a tiny drop of a sample and measure the change in properties while the
blood drop coagulates. This technology has the potential to replace many existing coagulation tests and has a
form appropriate for use in outpatient clinics, making testing less invasive and more convenient for patients. This
technology also addresses the current unmet in the market for coagulation testing in neonatal, pediatric, and
other vulnerable patient populations, who suffer from serious side-effects related to excessive and repetitive
blood draws. Additionally, the data output by the acoustic tweezing platform is comprehensive, allowing for more
capable monitoring of drugs to reduce the costs of treatment and prevent adverse drug effects.
The objective of this SBIR Phase I project is to develop a point-of-care coagulation analyzer that can
provide coagulation profile of patients with hemophilia using a single drop of whole blood. The new prototype will
be designed to perform experiments via acoustic tweezing spectroscopy (ATS), which currently require a large,
lab-based prototype. The two specific aims proposed in this application will cover 1) development of the benchtop
prototype from current lab-grade electronics and 2) evaluation of the device on blood samples collected from
healthy subjects and patients with hemophilia."

The University of Rhode Island proposes to supplement the URI ESTEEMED program to improve the training
outcomes of a diverse cohort of students from underrepresented backgrounds to pursue advanced education
and degrees in bioengineering and related disciplines. The goals for this supplement are (1) to enhance the
training outcomes of URI ESTEEMED Scholars by expanding the trainee cohort to improve peer-to-peer
networking, providing additional one-on-one academic support for trainees, and increasing the opportunity for
near-peer mentorship, and (2) to strengthen mentor training in the research environment at URI by creating a
formal Inclusive Mentor Training Program, providing intensive mentorship training opportunities for faculty and
graduate student mentors, and increasing the number of training facilitators in Rhode Island. To achieve these
goals, the URI ESTEEMED program will recruit two additional students per cohort, add two undergraduate near-
peer mentors during the academic year, retain a full-time graduate assistant throughout the calendar year and
provide additional support to the Program Coordinator, PI, and Co-PI. Additionally, URI ESTEEMED personnel
will complete facilitator training in collaboration with the Center for the Improvement of Mentored Experiences in
Research (CIMER) for the Entering Mentoring and Culturally Aware Mentoring curricula, allowing them to serve
as facilitators for these trainings, and by providing these training opportunities to faculty mentors. These efforts
will be assessed through qualitative surveys conducted by the Program Coordinator and through the established
CIMER assessment platforms. In recognizing the challenges facing underrepresented students during the
college transition, this administrative supplement will thereby provide the needed support to retain trainees and
improve the development of soft and technical skills necessary for conducting research in bioengineering and
related fields."

Chronic heavy or binge alcohol consumption damages the brain’s structural and functional integrity. These effects,
in large measure, are caused by alcohol’s toxic and degenerative effects on white matter (WM). Consequences
include declines in CNS neurobehavioral performance, reinforcement of dysfunctional activities, and multimodal
disabilities. Fortunately, growing evidence suggests that WM atrophy in alcohol-related brain degeneration (ARBD)
may be partly reversible through abstinence, which could be effectuated by cognitive-behavioral, brief intervention,
or neuro-modulatory strategies that reduce craving. However, to advance this aspect of alcohol use disorder (AUD)
research and patient care, efficient, non-invasive monitoring of treatment/intervention outcomes in relation to WM
ARBD is needed. Our overarching hypothesis is that WM ARBD is rooted in oligodendrocyte dysfunction caused
by oxidative stress, inflammation, and dysregulated signaling through insulin/IGF-1-PI3K-Akt-mTOR-mTORC.
These pathophysiological processes reduce mature oligodendrocyte populations and compact myelin, impair the
maturation of immature oligodendroglia, and alter sphingolipid metabolism, resulting in sulfatide and sphingomyelin
depletion and ceramide accumulation. Using established experimental rat models, we found that abstinence
partially reversed these pathologies, and more recently discovered that WM ARBD-related alterations in
oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein and lipid profiles can be detected in extracellular vesicles (EVs) isolated from
brain and serum. Furthermore, we have preliminary evidence that comparable studies are feasible using human
samples. This R21 application leverages the gains achieved through ongoing research by logically extending an
important sub-project included in Aim 3 of R01-AA028408. The main goal is to use our existing bank of human
AUD and control serum from IRB-approved longitudinal studies in which samples were obtained before and after
either brief intervention counseling or short-term baclofen treatment. In addition, we have banked pre- and post-
ghrelin treatment serum from a human laboratory study to assess the effects of craving on alcohol consumption.
The approaches will include comparative biochemical and molecular analyses of EVs from AUD and control human
serum to characterize the effects of ethanol and different treatments on the expression of oligodendrocyte/myelin
proteins, sphingolipids, and indices of stress. In addition, we plan to assess the sensitivity and specificity of
analyzing total versus oligodendrocyte-derived (O4+) EVs to detect WM ARBD effects and responses to treatment.
This R21 proposal has the advantage of collecting relevant human data in parallel with ongoing experimental
studies for potentially earlier clinical translation rather than awaiting the completion of rodent experiments, which
already show promising results. Furthermore, the outcomes of this research will lead to insights into the utility of
EV-based serum-diagnostic aids for WM ARBD detection, responses to treatment, and accessible, inexpensive,
prospective non-invasive monitoring that will especially benefit diverse underserved populations."
11040976,"SUMMARY
Monitoring of the incidence, morbidity, and mortality of respiratory infections has largely been performed by
collecting and analyzing data from hospitals and clinical laboratories. While these data sources provide valuable
information on risk factors, incidence, therapeutic response, and outcomes of severe disease, they do not reflect
the range of potential clinical presentations and courses of disease, factors that increase or decrease the risk of
community transmission, and the impact of disease on education and employment. We therefore propose to
create “PREVENT: Preparedness through Respiratory Virus Epidemiology and Community Engagement,” which
will serve as one of the CDC Pandemic Preparedness Network Cohorts and the Network’s Data Hub. We will
participate in Components A1, A2, B, and C, with a catchment that spans San Diego County in HHS Region 9
adjacent to the U.S./Mexico border. Our relevant experience includes establishment of innovative programs for
large-scale COVID-19 clinical testing, environmental surveillance through monitoring of wastewater and surface
swabs, viral genome sequencing, and monitoring of immunity using co-created community-based sample
collection strategies that are highly accessible and culturally sensitive. Major PREVENT activities will include:
Component A1: We will enroll and retain a diverse longitudinal cohort of 2,000 individuals for: weekly symptom
screening; surveys on knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to preventative measures; extraction of
outcome and vaccination data from electronic health records and immunization information systems; and
collection of follow-up data from participants on use of preventative/therapeutic measures and healthcare
resources, missed school/work, symptom type/duration, and long-term sequelae. Symptomatic swabs will be
collected and tested for 20 high-priority respiratory pathogens. Viral genome sequencing will be performed on a
subset of samples using targeted and metatranscriptomic methods. Samples will be banked for >5 years.
Component A2: Serial blood samples will be collected, analyzed, and banked from 20% of participants in
Component A1. Samples will be collected at enrollment, in the months flanking the respiratory infection season,
before/after vaccinations, and after infection. Quantitative immunoassays for antigen-specific antibody (Ab)
levels and neutralizing antibody (nAb) levels against contemporary circulating virus isolates will be performed.
Component B: For >100 index cases from A1 per year, we will collect and test daily nasal swabs from >75% of
household members for >2 weeks. A subset of swabs (including at least 1 per index case) will be analyzed by
viral genome sequencing, and high-priority pathogens/variants will be cultured. For a subset of households, we
will also explore the relationships between viral load (quantified by qPCR) and viral titer (by in vitro cell-based
assay), and between viral culture positivity and transmission.
Component C: We will serve as the Data Hub and Warehouse, and support protocol development across the
network, provide data entry and management tools, analyze data; and develop dashboards/visualizations."

The over-arching theme of this proposal is to train “comprehensive imaging scientists” in the skills
necessary to identify clinically relevant problems; develop instrumentation, sensors, and contrast
agents to form images appropriate for the problem; and analyze the resulting imaging data using
signal processing, mathematical modeling, visualization, and informatics techniques to improve the
prevention, detection, diagnosis, and treatment of human diseases. The program spans from molecular to
cellular to tissue to organ. In order for imaging scientists to be knowledgeable of the full trajectory from image
formation to analysis and decision-making, they must be trained in four core areas: Instrumentation, Devices,
and Contrast Agents; Image processing; Modeling and Visualization; and Data Mining and Informatics.
All students in the program are trained in the core concepts of these areas. The current training program is a
two-year pre-doctoral portfolio program. A total of 41 students have been admitted to the program. The
proposed renewal will train another 20 students. The program includes off-campus externship research
experiences; in-depth clinical engagement; and a wide-ranging professional development component.
Imaging Science is an integral element of basic science research and clinical medicine. Imaging cell trafficking
and receptor pharmacology in vivo have already led to targeted drug and gene therapies and an understanding
of cellular biochemical pathways will contribute to new advances in medicine. Individualized medicine relies
heavily on imaging techniques to select the best therapies and monitor progress. Although structural in situ
human imaging is already a critical component of clinical medicine, many advances are needed in functional
imaging of the brain and other organs to improve healthcare. Brain mapping which is a core focus of NIH
research relies heavily on imaging. We have identified a critical need for imaging scientists to develop new
imaging instrumentation and apply that instrumentation with appropriate methods from image processing;
modeling and visualization; and informatics and data mining. In recognition of the potential of artificial
intelligence to transform medical imaging, our program emphasizes applications of machine learning.
This training program fills a critical niche by providing highly skilled scientists who are trained in the broad
trajectory of imaging science. Understanding the interplay between instrumentation and image analysis,
including machine learning methods, is important for designing the next generation of hardware and software
tools for quantifying complex biological systems and providing robust clinical tools. A key outcome of the
program is that trainees gain the skills necessary to identify clinically relevant problems."
11039101,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a progressive disease, which is often characterized by rampant fibrosis of
the corpus cavernosum in severe disease states. It is hypothesized that hypoxia resulting from inadequate
blood perfusion and/or depressed oxygenation is a primary driver of the fibrotic process in the corpus
cavernosum. Moreover, ischemic priapism is highly prevalent in men with sickle cell disease. In these
instances, sickling of the erythrocytes obstructs venous outflow from the corporal bodies, resulting in prolonged
erections with minimal inflow of new blood into the penis. This stagnation of blood in the penis results in severe
penile hypoxia despite the presence of a prolonged erection, which ultimately leads to advanced erectile
function. This proposal is in response to PAR-23-119 “Catalytic Tool and Technology Development in Kidney,
Urologic, and Hematologic Diseases”. Our goal is to develop a wearable device for prolonged penile oxygen
saturation monitoring that can contour to the skin of the penile shaft, that is also flexible to movement and
stretchable for expansion during erection. This proposal leverages our team’s recent innovation of a
stretchable optical sensor photodiode for wearable photoplethysmography. We seek to optimize and validate
this technology in rodents before advancing to testing in human patients. There are two specific aims to this
proposal. Aim 1 is to design and fabricate optical sensors for rodent penile hemodynamic monitoring. Aim 2 is
to determine if changes in measured oxygen saturation correspond with changes in rodent intracavernous
pressure upon erection induction. Multiple variables can influence the oxygen saturation signal attained from
photoplethysmography, as well as the depth within the tissue that the signal is obtained from. Major variables
include the composition of the tissue through which light must penetrate, the wavelength of light emitted from
the light source, and the light intensity emitted from the source. For this project, we will use both mice and rats
due to the difference in thickness of the penile fascia, tunica albuginea, and cavernous smooth muscle and
collagen through which light must penetrate and reflect off of oxygenated hemoglobin in the sinusoids. Devices
will be fabricated to form fit the mouse and rat penile shaft, with three prototypes for each that contain micro
light emitting diodes that emit different wavelengths of light. Three different light intensities will be used while
testing each wavelength. Variable changes in intracavernous pressure will be induced by stimulation of the
cavernous nerve with variable voltages. Additionally, both rapid and prolonged erections will be induced by
intracavernous injection of sodium nitroprusside and papaverine."
11042620,"Project Summary. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were 70,237 drug
overdose deaths reported in the United States in 2017, more than 130 per day, with 67.8% involving opioids
[1]. While medications are available to treat the disease (e.g., methadone, suboxone, and extended release
naltrexone), relapse rates remain alarmingly high [2-4]. Clearly, new approaches are needed. To this end, we
recognize that addiction involves not only hijacking of the reward pathway, but also of the need pathway [5]. As
such, we posited that heroin seeking and taking should be reduced by peripheral stimulation of the glucagon-
like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) ‘satiety’ pathway. In support, activation of the GLP-1R pathway has been
shown to inhibit not only ingestion of palatable sweets, water when thirsty, and salt when sodium deprived, but
also responding for alcohol, nicotine, and cocaine in rats and mice [6-12]. Here, we show for the first time that
pretreatment with a GLP-1R agonist also reduces heroin taking, seeking, and drug-induced reinstatement in
rats. The objective of this application is to test whether treatment with a GLP-1R agonist can reduce relapse in
humans with an opioid use disorder (OUD). One advantage of using GLP-1R agonists is that various
formulations already are approved for treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes [13, 14]. UG3 Phase Aim G1
will conduct a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled pilot study to determine whether once daily
treatment with the shorter acting GLP-1R agonist, liraglutide, can safely and effectively reduce craving and
brain responses to drug cues among patients in residential treatment for an OUD. UG3 Phase Aim G2 will use
well established animal models to test the efficacy and safety of a more risky, longer-acting, but more
efficacious, GLP-1R agonist, semaglutide, on heroin seeking and cue/drug/stress-induced reinstatement.
Milestones: (1) Demonstrate safety and efficacy liraglutide at approved doses to reduce craving and brain
responses to drug cues among patients in residential treatment for OUD who also are receiving counseling
only (CO) or counseling+buprenorphine/naltrexone (BUP/NA); (2) Verify that semaglutide is safe and effective
in reducing cue/drug/stress-induced heroin seeking in an animal model. If these milestones are met, UH3
Phase Aim H1 will conduct a two-arm, pseudo-randomized, placebo controlled multi-site clinical trial in
outpatients with an OUD to test whether treatment with semaglutide vs. placebo will reduce relapse out to 180
days in patients treated with CO and counseling+BUP/NA. UH3 Phase Aim H2 will use animal models to
further probe the efficacy and usefulness of semaglutide to prevent initiation of heroin self-administration, to
reduce ongoing heroin self-administration, or to serve as a non-opioid “bridge to care”, for example. If our
hypotheses are supported, we will show that treatment with GLP-1R agonists can safely and effectively reduce
opioid craving, seeking, and relapse in rats and humans, providing a second indication for full multi-site, Phase
III clinical trials, and we will lay the preclinical and clinical groundwork for approval from the FDA."

Our vision is to unravel and ultimately reverse the intricate network of causal factors throughout the life course
that disrupts biological homeostasis to promote colorectal cancer (CRC) among individuals younger than age 50
years. Uniting leading scientific minds in early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC) research and complementary
fields, we have embraced disruptive, transdisciplinary approaches spanning cells to individuals to populations to
address the core Grand Challenge to “Determine why the incidence of early-onset cancers is rising globally”. We
will address specific questions of “the mechanisms linking lifetime exposures with cancer initiation and
promotion” by focusing on EOCRC as an ideal model for early-onset cancer due to the availability of well-
characterized animal models and well-established and prevalent precursor lesion, the adenomatous polyp
(adenoma), offering a unique opportunity for interception and prevention. Our work will transform the field by
directly addressing our overarching goal to “identify and understand the processes through which different
biological and environmental factors cause early-onset cancers”, and reverse the burden in a timely, effective,
feasible, inclusive fashion. Our team, both working independently and in collaboration, has uncovered several
risk factors that are likely to be drivers for the rising incidence for EOCRC. We are now uniquely positioned to
translate etiologic understanding to actionable prevention by identifying novel factors, including environmental
and social determinants, and deepening our understanding into overlooked dimensions of exposure throughout
the life course. The unprecedented scope and scale of our proposal can only be supported through Cancer
Grand Challenges since our “high-risk” disruptive approach requires deep interactions between work packages
(WP)s led by leaders in diverse disciplines. This will enable incorporation of fresh perspectives to move beyond
traditional risk-factor epidemiology toward an integrated, mechanistically-informed model with population scale
and cellular resolution of the multiple and cumulative “hits” that promote EOCRC to inform the development of
actionable prevention. Our innovations intersect epidemiology, small molecule discovery, genomics, stem cell
biology, immunology, and computational biology with these key features: 1) harmonization of diverse cohorts
with data and biospecimens collected across the lifecourse; 2) innovative and reliable analysis of small molecules
to detect novel exposures; 3) high-resolution technologies for analysis of target tissues; 4) model systems
capable of interrogating accumulating exposures across the lifespan and their impact on the cellular ecosystem;
5) prevention through risk assessment and pharmacologic/lifestyle interventions. Collectively, our work will serve
as an exemplar for transforming research into other early-onset cancers."
11041481,"Administrative Supplement to Purchase Infrared Imager
Abstract
My R35 funded research program is focused on RNA structure, uncovering its hidden role in regulating gene
expression beyond simply being a message from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. I am interested in post-
transcriptional regulation, where subtle structural changes in RNA significantly influence its fate – how it's
translated, spliced, and even degraded. We have made significant progress in understanding and predicting
RNA structure’s effect on protein expression, and we are now involved heavily in validating these predictions.
These experiments most-often involve measuring protein expression by western blot. Since we are particularly
interested in subtle differences in protein expression for multiple targets high sensitivity and throughput are
particularly important. We are therefore requesting funds to purchase a High-sensitivity near-infrared (NIR)
fluorescence instrument, specifically the Li-Cor DLx. The Li-Cor DLx excels at detecting faint NIR signals
emitted by various biological probes, enabling sensitive visualization and quantification of target molecules like
proteins. It has rapid scanning capabilities that will significantly increase sample processing efficiency,
combined with accurate and robust digital imaging that ensures data consistency and facilitates image
analysis. As a result, funding this administrative supplement has the potential to significantly accelerate our
ability to validate RNA structures regulating protein expression while maintaining high levels of rigor and
reproducibly in our research. Housed in the Genome Sciences Building, this instrument will be a workhorse
for the Laederach group while also serving as a vital resource for researchers across NIGMS-supported
programs who call the building home or work in closely related fields."

11036543,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In response to RFA-DA-21-250,
we propose to investigate
inflammation, blood-brain-barrier (BBB) permeability
and reward functions in people with HIV (PWH) and comorbid depression. Depression is the most common
neuropsychiatric illness among PWH, with an average prevalence of up to 78% in some cohorts. Alarmingly, it
is estimated that by 2030, the top two leading causes of disease burden globally will be HIV and depressive
disorders. These data highlight the urgent need for research focusing on neurobiological mechanisms underlying
HIV/depression comorbidity. Our proposal addresses this need. Our proposed model: (1) HIV infection induces
systemic inflammation [peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), cytokines]; (2) systemic inflammation
extends to the CNS through transmigration of PBMC subtypes through the BBB; (3) disruption of BBB integrity
and neuroinflammation lead to alterations in the reward circuitry, contributing to depression in PWH. In support
of this model, our group has pioneered the study of BBB in PWH, establishing a highly reproducible and reliable
in vitro model of the human BBB, comprised of a co-culture of human brain microvascular endothelial cells and
human astrocytes. We showed that compared to healthy controls (HC), specific PBMC subtypes from PWH
preferentially transmigrate across the BBB model, despite suppressed viral load. In our depression research, we
found that anhedonia–a core symptom of depression reflecting reward deficits–was associated with worse
depression outcomes, including chronicity and suicidality. To better delineate reward circuitry, we identified
distinct resting-state network features associated with depression and anhedonia using striatal-based intrinsic
functional connectivity and whole-brain parcellation data-driven graph theory analysis. We additionally utilized
the reward flanker (RFT) and reward prediction error (RPET) fMRI tasks to examine distinct brain activity during
reward anticipation, attainment, and prediction errors. Furthermore, we reported associations between
circulatory cytokines with both anhedonia and reward neurocircuitry in youth. In addition, our team has
implemented dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI and a water-extraction-with-phase-contrast-arterial-spin-
tagging (WEPCAST) MRI, enabling in vivo regional and global BBB permeability, respectively. Extending our
compelling findings expertise, we will test the overall hypothesis that PWH exhibit increased systemic
inflammation and BBB disruption (assessed in vivo and in vitro), leading to reward dysfunction and depression.
We will utilize a 2×2 factorial design: 1) 100 depressed PWH; 2) 100 non-depressed PWH; 3) 50 depressed HIV
negative people; and 4) 50 HC. We will include subthreshold depression to capture a wide range of depression
severity. Study procedures will assess psychopathology, reward, anxiety, trauma, cognition, HIV treatment,
CD4+ count, viral load (VL), and immune assays. Neuroimaging will include DCE-MRI, WEPCAST and fMRI."
11041361,"Administrative Supplement to Accelerating Treatment Development for Psychosis in AD: MODEL AD+P
 Psychotic symptoms occur in ~ 40-60% of individuals with Alzheimer Disease (AD with psychosis, AD+P).
Numerous studies have found that the AD+P phenotype is associated with more rapid cognitive decline than AD
subjects without psychosis (AD-P). Current, empirically developed treatments for psychosis in AD have limited
efficacy, do not alter the more rapid disease progression, and are associated with substantial toxicity, including
excess mortality. MODEL AD+P was funded with the goal of closing several critical gaps in knowledge that
currently inhibit effective treatment development for psychosis in AD. We were funded to accomplish this goal
by conducting a set of integrated experiments that include: Aim 1) more finely resolve signaling alterations in
AD+P by characterizing the post-synaptic density (PSD) phosphoproteome and kinome signature of AD+P, and;
Aim 2) test computationally identified drugs, including the CCR5 inhibitor, maraviroc, for effects on the PSD
protein and phosphoprotein signature in 3 mouse models of AD pathology (5XFAD, APPSAA, hTau) in
comparison to WT mice.
 We now request an administrative supplement designed to increase the likely impact of the funded research
objectives of MODEL AD+P on treatment development for AD+P. We propose to accomplish this in two
Supplemental Aims. Supplemental Aim 1 enhances our understanding of maraviroc's effects on the PSD
proteome in the 5xFAD, APPSAA and hTau mouse models by testing the impact of maraviroc treatment on post
synaptic structural dynamics of dendritic spines and on behavioral tests of learning/memory in these same
mouse models. In Supplemental Aim 2, we will then integrate maraviroc's effects on spine dynamics and
learning with findings from the currently funded Aims in which we will have: characterized the PSD proteome
and phosphoproteome after maraviroc treatment in these models and more deeply characterized the PSD
proteome, phosphoproteome, and kinome signature of AD+P.
 These Supplemental Aims do not represent a change in the scope of MODEL AD+P. The primary research
objective remains consistent, focusing on the PSD proteome in AD+P. The Supplement Aims enriching our
existing framework without altering the fundamental direction of the research. If successful, these Supplemental
Aims will augment MODEL AD+P's primary purpose: to accelerate development of experimental therapeutics
for AD+P. Specifically, these Supplemental Aims will link the understanding of the PSD proteome of AD+P
generated by the currently funded study directly to post-synaptic structural changes of a fundamental plasticity
mechanism, dendritic spine structural dynamics. In so doing we will be positioned to identify additional targets
(and drugs for these targets) that can be tested for therapeutic impact, and via our data and resource sharing
plan, similarly enable investigation of potential new treatments by the larger research community."
11042520,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Adult stem cells are the agents of organ renewal, remodeling and repair. Their hallmark ability to
concomitantly self-renew and produce terminal progeny enables lifelong maintenance of organ form and
function. At any given point in time, stem cells receive an ever-changing panoply of local and systemic signals
that reinforce stemness, activate division, or direct cellular fate as needed to respond to the tissue's evolving
needs. These signals are deployed across space and time to marshal diverse stem cell behaviors for
coordinated, organ-scale outputs such as tissue homeostasis. Such emergent properties are fundamental to
the biology of adult tissues and essential for human health—yet, our grasp of their workings is rudimentary.
 My lab seeks to uncover the cellular mechanisms that underlie the robustness and flexibility of adult organ
maintenance. The goal of our MIRA program is to build a comprehensive framework for understanding how
each individual cell is guided by local and systemic signals for a net result of cellular equilibrium at the organ
scale. Our model system is the adult Drosophila midgut, a stem cell-based, tubular epithelial organ that is
functionally equivalent to the vertebrate stomach and small intestine. Our approach leverages unique live
imaging capabilities—pioneered in our lab—and precision genetic tools to illuminate real-time cell dynamics in
vivo and to probe the mechanisms that tune these dynamics.
 Here, we focus on three questions with broad significance to stem cell-based epithelial organs: 1) How
does the spatial distribution of stem cells––which we find is non-random, due to autonomous stem cell motility–
–impact the efficiency and robustness of organ turnover? 2) What are the real-time spatial kinetics of the EGF
feedback signals that equilibrate stem cell divisions and differentiated cell death, and does ectopic
manipulation of these kinetics support or negate a point-source model for organ size control? 3) How do new,
differentiating cells, which are born outside of the epithelium's sealed network of occluding junctions, integrate
seamlessly into the organ as they differentiate?
 These studies build upon and expand our R01-funded work on organ-scale stem cell dynamics. Since the
cellular life cycle is a universal feature of self-renewing organs, the tunable, population-level mechanisms that
we uncover in the Drosophila midgut will provide a template for thinking about more complex organs, including
those in humans.

11042583,"Macrocyclic peptides (MCPs) can demonstrate antibody-like potency and specificity against ""undruggable""
targets such as protein-protein interactions. Some MPCs, especially ones found in nature, also have drug-like
cell permeability and even oral absorption, leading to the proposition that MCPs define a fertile ground for the
discovery of novel, cell permeable inhibitors against undruggable targets. My lab is among the leaders in the
worldwide effort to define the factors that govern passive membrane permeability in MCPs. In addition to
defining a set of rules for generating molecules in this space, we have shown that existing macrocyclic natural
products represent only a tiny fraction of potential permeable scaffolds in this size range (MW 700-1500). As
the basic science of membrane permeability in MCPs has continued to mature, new questions have arisen
which our lab is uniquely positioned to address: To what extent can side chains sequester polar backbone
atoms in the membrane, and, conversely, to what extent can polar side chain functionality be ""smuggled"" into
the membrane via interactions with backbone atoms? Are there scaffold geometries that enhance these
effects? What is the fundamental size limit to passive membrane permeability? To what extent can strongly
ionizable groups be incorporated into lipophilic MCPs without abrogating permeability? Can DNA-encoded
library technology be used to discover novel, membrane permeable scaffolds that greatly enhance the extent
to which we can evaluate this chemical space, especially in the higher MW range? Our program will capitalize
on recent developments in DNA-encoded library (DEL) technology to generate large (108 - 1012-member)
libraries that are diversified at both the side chain and backbone levels. We have shown that DNA-conjugated
MCPs can be separated chromatographically based on the permeability of the pendant macrocycle and
independent of the encoding DNA molecule, allowing us to use the power of split-pool synthesis and next-
generation sequencing to dramatically expand our ability to delineate the constraints on permeability among
highly diverse scaffolds well above 1000 MW. Finally, there have been few systematic studies on the impact of
scaffold geometry on efflux and hepatic metabolism, which, besides permeability, are important factors that
govern pharmacokinetic behavior. We will utilize our powerful split-pool synthesis and MSMS-analytical tool to
determine the effect of scaffold geometry on efflux and metabolism, which will further enhance our
understanding of this important chemical space. This MIRA proposal seeks to build on a vibrant and successful
research program to uncover the basic scientific principles governing drug-like properties in a chemical class
that continues to inspire medicinal chemists in their pursuit of ever more challenging targets."
11042610,"Abstract
Understanding how T cell receptors (TCRs) see tumor antigens presented by MHCs is necessary to fully
understand how the immune system recognizes tumor antigens, and to reap the full potential of antigen-specific
immunotherapy. To achieve this goal, a quantum leap forward is required in which the revolutionary advances in
machine learning are combined with a large volume of structure, function, data on matched TCR-pMHC pairs.
The development of accurate predictors of TCR-antigen recognition will be dependent on the creation and
integration sequencing-based datasets with high-throughput structural and functional insights. Our proposal,
submitted as a CRUK/NCI Grand Challenge team (MATCHMAKERS) will combine researchers with expertise in
immunology, methods development, structural biology, and computation to enable generalized prediction and
design of TCR recognition. This work will be spread across four Work Packages (WPs):
WP1: Large-scale generation of TCR-pMHC pairs from naturally occurring sources. We will build datasets of
naturally occurring TCR-pMHC pairs. Our team will use an array of approaches to collect these datasets, from
humans and from mouse models, and in the context of both cancer and immunity more generally.
WP2: Ultra-high throughput TCR-pMHC matching using molecular engineering. Efforts to create general models
will require a broader array of data than feasible to collect from natural TCR systems. We will use an array of
synthetic approaches developed by our team to comprehensively match TCRs with pMHCs to train
computational models.
WP3: Large-scale structural and biochemical analyses of TCR-pMHC interactions. A key to our team’s vision is
to match interaction datasets with high throughput structural and functional insights. A deep understanding of
how the TCR contacts with MHC helices control function and orientation will be essential for training and testing
computational models.
WP4 AI-based prediction and design of TCR-pMHC interactions. We will integrate our data to train next-
generation algorithms capable of generally predicting and designing TCR-pMHC interactions. These predictions
will proceed through a reiterative testing and feedback circuits for further model optimization."
11038250,"Lewy body disorders are a family of neurodegenerative conditions characterized by deposition of the abundant synaptic
protein, α-synuclein, in insoluble cytosolic aggregates. The two brain regions most vulnerable to α-synucleinopathy in early
disease stages are the olfactory bulb/anterior olfactory nucleus (OB/AON) of the rostral telencephalon and the dorsomotor
vagal nuclei of the caudal brainstem. We have infused preformed fibrils (PFFs) synthesized from α-synuclein into the rodent
OB/AON to induce aggregate formation in the limbic forebrain. Limbic α-synucleinopathy in our murine model is associated
with impairments in smell, affect, and spatial reference memory. A large body of experimental evidence supports the view
that α-synucleinopathy is associated with prion-like seeding and cell-to-cell spread of the aggregates through circuitry. Thus,
the intercellular transfer of aggregates may be prevented by engulfment of aggregates from the interstitial fluid or the
efferocytosis of neurons that bear early signs of Lewy-related pathology. Microglia/macrophages (MG/MΦ) are the
professional phagocytes of the brain, but they play complex roles in disease and may suffer phagocytic exhaustion when
faced with excess α-synuclein. Perhaps for these reasons, MG/MΦ are unable to fully prevent Lewy body disease. However,
repopulation of MG/MΦ can be jumpstarted with transient administration of the orally bioavailable CSF1R inhibitor,
PLX5622. In our PFF model, dietary PLX5622 killed ~60% of MG/MΦ, and upon PLX5622 withdrawal, there was vigorous
repopulation of the MG/MΦ niche and an 85% reduction (95% CI 0.02-27.53%) in α-synucleinopathic aggregates in male
mice by 20 months of age. Unexpectedly, transient PLX5622 also increased aggregate sizes in both sexes, and aggregate
sizes were positively correlated with spatial memory. Hence, larger aggregates may be associated with less prion-like
seeding and dispersal. We hypothesize that the probability of successful MG/MΦ engulfment of α-synuclein aggregates is
boosted after a depletion/repopulation event in the PFF model and associated with superior spatial memory. Pilot data
unexpectedly reveal that neurons (and not glia) house the most fluorescent PFFs after OB/AON infusions, while MG/MΦ
engulf neurons housing the PFFs. In Aim 1, we will identify the neural cell type with the highest probability of harboring
PFFs, determine if these cells can, in turn, be engulfed by MG/MΦ, and test if boosting MG/MΦ proliferation boosts their
engulfment capacities. In Aim 2, we will ascertain how transient PLX5622 exposure reduces α-syn aggregate burden in our
PFF model. Changes in the transcriptomes of depleted/repopulated MG/MΦ in the PFF model will be identified by RNAseq
on flow-sorted MG/MΦ, with a focus on genes involved in endocytic/lysosomal processing. The expression of candidate
genes will be suppressed by MG/MΦ cell-targeted AAV6/TM6-shRNA, and we will then test if MG/MΦ engulfment of α-syn
aggregates is lowered when lysosomal processing is impeded in vivo. Impact: If neurons house the most α-syn aggregates
and cannot be engulfed by MG/MΦ in sufficient numbers, this may explain why diseased neurons persist long enough to
propagate Lewy pathologies. This also implies that not all cell loss is detrimental. Further, if depleted/repopulated MG/MΦ
can engulf more α-syn aggregates, this may explain why they are able to alleviate aggregate burden in our PFF model, and
CSF1R blockade with various antagonists should continue to be exploited in the battle against Lewy body disorders."

coordinately facilitate physiological regulation, including hormone responsiveness, of normal and cancer cell

nuclear organization, transcription factor localization and metastasis of breast cancer to bone; 3. Dynamic
modifications of higher-order inter- and intra-chromosomal interactions in breast cancer cells; 4. Coordinate
control of cell growth and phenotype by tissue-specific transcription factors; 5. Epitranscriptomic profiling of
endocrine therapy resistant and advanced breast cancer cells in response to selective estrogen receptor
modulators; and 6. Noncoding RNA-mediated regulation of the aggressive breast cancer phenotype. This
application captures the scientific progress, synergy and momentum of our research team and leverages
powerful new technologies for editing the genome, visualizing cells at super resolution and in real time, and
decoding higher-order genome organization. We will use normal mammary epithelial, subtype-specific and
endocrine resistant breast cancer cell models for discovery, then validate key findings and examine potential
clinical relevance using animal models, public databases and patient tumor specimens and organoids. Emphasis
will be on exploring molecular mechanisms that integrate multiple dimensions of epigenetic control with modified
genome organization in breast cancer. Each of the three projects focuses on a unique aspect of epigenetic
control that is required for fidelity of gene expression and is compromised in breast cancer, including: the pivotal
role of mitotic gene bookmarking in stabilizing the normal mammary epithelial phenotype (Project 1); novel
functions of bromodomain chromatin readers in endocrine therapy resistance (Project 2); and contributions of
the novel long noncoding RNA MANCR to deregulated genome organization in aggressive breast cancer (Project
3). A shared resource core will support integrated bioinformatics and biostatistics analyses; standardized
experimental design; cell, organoid and in vivo models; and resource authentication to ensure scientific rigor and
reproducibility. An administrative core will maximize scientific and programmatic integration, prioritization and
oversight. The impact of this program will be the integration of multiple levels of genome organization and of
epigenetic control to understand how gene regulation is disrupted in breast cancer."
11042626,"Project summary:
The long-term goal of my research program is to understand, in detail, the mechanisms of
mammalian mRNA 3’ processing and its regulation. mRNA 3’-end formation, typically
involving an endonucleolytic cleavage followed by polyadenylation, is an essential step of
eukaryotic gene expression and it significantly impacts many aspects of RNA metabolism,
including mRNA stability, subcellular localization and translation. In addition, the majority
of eukaryotic genes produce multiple mRNA isoforms with distinct 3’ ends through
alternative polyadenylation (APA). Recent studies have revealed that APA is highly
regulated in development and plays an important role in post-transcriptional gene
regulation. Aberrant APA patterns have been associated with a wide range of diseases,
from cancer to neurological disorders. Key outstanding questions in the mRNA 3’
processing field include: 1) what is the structure-function relationship of the mRNA 3’
processing complex; 2) how is mRNA 3’ processing regulated by cell signaling; 3) how is
APA regulated by RNA-binding proteins? We will address these questions by using
biochemical, structural, and genomic analyses. The results of these studies will not only
provide novel insights into this key step in eukaryotic gene expression, but also pave the
way for developing novel therapy for many diseases."
11039008,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Gonorrhea, caused by the Gram-negative bacteria Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NGO), is one of the most prevalent
sexually transmitted infections worldwide. In 2013 and 2019 the CDC’s antibiotic resistance threats reports,
designated a threat level of urgent to NGO, in part due to the alarming rise in the number of highly antibiotic
resistant strains. Resistance to last line antibiotics and treatment failure is now common and there is a critic
need to explore new approaches to develop therapeutic interventions. Small regulatory RNAs (herein called
sRNAs) are an important class of regulatory molecules in bacterial cells. sRNAs control numerous cellular
processes, and for many bacterial pathogens, sRNAs play a critical role during transmission and infection.
Despite their importance sRNAs are extremely understudied (to date, in NGO only 7 sRNA have been studied
in detail). One major impediment to sRNA study is the absence of sRNA genes from annotated genome
reference files. As a consequence, techniques that rely on genome annotation files (such as RNAseq) omit
sRNAs. To address this oversight, and to facilitate improved study of sRNAs in NGO, we have constructed a
genome annotation file containing annotations for 559 previously reported potential sRNAs in NGO strain
FA1090. Using this file, we have reanalyzed publicly available RNAseq data sets and generated a list of 88
prioritized sRNAs which we consider have high potential to be bona fide trans acting sRNAs in NGO. In this
study we propose to construct the first NGO sRNA mutant library in which we generate 88 sRNA mutants by
knocking out 88 previously unstudied sRNA genes. We will go on to phenotypically characterize the newly
created sRNA mutant library to elucidate role(s) for these molecules."
11038894,"We propose to develop a synthetic biological system to manipulate subcellular RNAs and proteins in growth
cones or synapses of subtype- and context-specific neurons. This system has both direct, powerful near-term
experimental-investigative potential and future potential toward novel, uniquely specific forms of therapeutics/
bioactive delivery. The systems enable unique forms of subcellular functional investigation in subtype- and stage-
specific neuronal circuitry, offering generalizable modularity for manipulation of RNA and/or protein localized
to developing growth cones during circuit formation and to presynaptic compartments in maturing and mature
circuitry. Subcellular functions of proteins regulating connectivity and (dys)function of subtype-specific circuitry
are poorly understood. Based on successful preliminary studies, we propose to develop these tools for in vivo
perturbation of molecular abundances by integrating subcellular localization motifs with inducible gene
expression systems. This system will enable discovery of RNAs/proteins that function subcellularly to control
overall organization, precision, and function of distinct neural circuits, and how they are dysregulated in disease.
 We aim to integrate motifs that selectively traffick proteins to GCs and/or presynapses with an inducible
gene expression system, enabling subcellular-specific overexpression via direct motif fusion, and knockdown
via motif fusion to hfCas13d, a refined mRNA degrader. We will use data from recently developed experimental
and analytical approaches purifying subtype-specific GCs or presynapses and their parent somata or nuclei from
developing or mature mouse cortex, and quantitatively “mapping” RNAs and proteins between these subcellular
compartments. This enabled identification of molecules with subcellular localizations specific to subtypes and
stages, and/or to disease, and measuring of local translation. However, such candidates can function in multiple
subcellular domains, at multiple distinct stages/contexts. Current approaches for whole-neuron perturbation of
molecular abundances produce off-target effects, complicating investigation of subcellular-specific RNA/protein
function, thus preventing elucidation of molecular mechanisms regulating circuit formation and (dys)function.
 We aim to develop approaches for subcellular- and stage-/context-specific manipulation of molecular
abundances in developing and mature circuits. In Aim 1, we will develop a system to subcellularly manipulate
RNA/protein abundances in growth cones that regulate distinct developmental stages of circuit construction.
In Aim 2, we will develop a system to subcellularly manipulate presynaptic RNA/protein abundances later in
maturity that regulate synapse function, maintenance, and plasticity, thus are linked to memory, synaptic
weighting, and circuit function. We will employ presynaptic-localizing motifs in mature circuits. These systems
will enable elucidation of subcellular mechanisms controlling circuit formation and function; investigation of
how subcellular dysregulation might cause developmental, degenerative, and neuropsychiatric disorders; and
potentially toward novel therapeutics– circuit- and subcellular domain-specific, to minimize off-target effects."

11043080,"Meiosis is the keystone of reproductive success in sexually reproductive organisms as failure to
successfully complete meiosis results in aneuploidy, a leading cause of developmental diseases and
miscarriages. Successful chromosome segregation is facilitated by using DNA recombination to form
crossovers (COs) between homologous chromosomes. Not all recombination events result in a CO
however and the majority are repaired as noncrossovers (NCOs). Thus, the decision whether to form a CO
or NCO is a critical regulatory point during meiosis that is poorly understood. Despite having a clear
picture of the genetic requirements for a crossover to form, it is completely unknown why some breaks
are chosen to be repaired as crossovers and others as noncrossovers. The parent grant of the current
equipment supplement addresses this critical knowledge gap by using heterozygous chromosome
inversions in Drosophila melanogaster as a model. Heterozygous inversions pose an interesting problem
for the meiotic program. Meiosis requires that homologous chromosomes recognize and use each other
as templates for precise repair during recombination, yet inversions disrupt the synteny between
homologs. There are two downstream effects: COs are suppressed locally on the inversion chromosome,
and a checkpoint is activated, which leads to a genome-wide increase in COs on non-inverted
chromosomes. We have shown that these responses are mediated through changing the CO vs. NCO
decision. In this equipment supplement, we are requesting funds to purchase the Imaris image
analysis software from Oxford Instruments. We currently have the microscopes we need (including a
Leica Stellaris 5 confocal owned by us and housed in our lab, and access to a Leica TCS SP8 gated STED
microscope housed in the CWRU Light Microscopy Core), but we do not have access to Imaris. Along with
the purchase of the software, we are also requesting funds for 3 years of the maintenance plan that will
include unlimited technical training and support for applications specific to our use case. Purchase of this
software will generate data critical for analyzing the structure of the synaptonemal complex at
inversion breakpoints and insight into defects in the structure that alter the CO/NCO decision, a high-
priority goal of the parent grant. Importantly, the methods we are proposing have been successfully
carried out by other Drosophila meiosis labs multiple times; we will be applying those methods to our
own system."
11037745,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cortical taste responses reflect sensory stimulation, perception, and behavioral decisions. These responses
are the result of interactions among several brain areas. Ascending signals from the thalamus provide
information from the periphery, but there are also recurrent interactions among several forebrain areas,
including massive descending feedback connections to thalamus. Using this circuitry, animals must rapidly
decide whether they will consume or expel a substance applied to the tongue. This behavior is natural,
requires no training, and has obvious behavioral correlates that reflect the consumption or expulsion decision.
Understanding how multiple brain areas interact to produce responses, perception, and behavior is a major
goal of systems neuroscience, and the gustatory system is well suited to this pursuit. Recent work from a
number of labs has gone far to characterize the nonlinear population dynamics of cortical taste activity, and
has begun to unravel the inter-regional interactions that generate said dynamics, most notably with regard to
the basolateral amygdala (Lin, et al., 2021; Mahmood, et al., 2023). Thalamo-cortical interactions have been
slower to yield to scrutiny, however, because of the intense difficulty of even recording from taste thalamus in
awake animals—something that has only been done a few times (e.g., Liu and Fontanini, 2015).
We propose to explore the relationship between ensemble activity in the gustatory thalamus and ensemble
activity in the gustatory cortex. There have been few studies of physiological responses in gustatory thalamus,
and no studies where gustatory thalamus neurons have been recorded simultaneously with gustatory cortical
neurons. New methods using high-density silicon electrodes now allow action potentials of afferent neurons
and local neurons to be distinguished, allowing thalamic axons and cortical neurons to be recorded at a single
site in the cortex. We will validate and employ these methods to simultaneously record thalamic and cortical
neurons in the gustatory system of awake behaving rats during taste deliveries followed by consumption or
expulsion. By examining these structures in a system with tight linkages between cortical activity and behavior,
we expect to uncover new principles of interaction between thalamus and cortex."

It is well appreciated that the spatial organization of the biophysical and biochemical cues in the extracellular
matrix (ECM) in concert with the stromal cell organization along the cortical-medullary axis of the developing
kidney is vitally important to nephron development. These insights have been obtained from animal and organoid
models, however, the exact mechanisms behind the tightly regulated spatial and temporal differentiation and cell
specification have not been fully established. Although reductionistic, an in vitro microphysiological system (MPS)
offers a platform that allows recapitulation and control of the developing kidney's critical structural and functional
components. Here, we develop an easy-to-use modular 3D model of the developing nephron in which the
biophysical and biochemical cues of the ECM, soluble factors, and stromal cell identity can be spatially patterned
along the length of an epithelialized tube (Aim 1). In Aim 2, we will create a framework for MPS fabrication and
model establishment to enable wide distribution and technology transfer to other labs that are established experts
in investigating different aspects of nephrogenesis and renal pathology but non-experts in using microfluidic in
vitro models. This easy-to-use system will provide researchers without MPS expertise with a tool to investigate
the role and mechanisms of biochemical, cell-cell, and cell-ECM interactions during nephrogenesis. As such,
this model will be designed to be quickly and easily disseminated to the research community to rapidly increase

Nephron salt reabsorption is essential to salt and water homeostasis and its dysregulation is involved in the
progression of kidney and cardiovascular diseases, including chronic kidney disease, hypertension and those
started by diabetes and obesity. There are only a few methods to measure renal tubular ion transport at the
single cell in live animals that were developed over 40 years ago. Using multi-photon imaging of the live mouse
kidney we recently developed a method to monitor Thick Ascending Limb (TAL)-mediated urine concentration at
the single tubule level. We propose to develop 2 transgenic mice lines expressing a Chloride-sensing genetically
encoded probe that will allow measurement of cortical TAL and Distal Convoluted tubule (DCT) NaCl transport
using 2-photon microcopy. In Specific Aim 1 we will generate inducible Umod-Cre, Slc12a3-Cre-SuperClomelen

the initial rates of Cl entry using SuperClomeleon mice or ClopHensor expression in the distal tubule in vivo. Our
preliminary data demonstrate the use of a ratiometric Cl-sensitive probe to measure intracellular chloride in
epithelial cells and measurement of urinary concentrating capacity and luminal Na via intravital MP microscopy
in mice. Our studies will demonstrate the use of genetically encoded Cl indicators for measurement of nephron
NaCl transport and spur the development of new sensors (K, Na, Mg, cAMP, cGMP, etc) to be used in live mice."

Work-related stressors take a heavy toll on individuals’ health and well-being as made even more evident by the
increased awareness of essential workers during the pandemic and its still lingering impact on workplace settings
that already had the largest structural inequities. Resilience programs have arisen as a promising workplace
strategy to improve mental health and well-being for those at greatest risk; however, emerging programs are
limited by time- and resource-intensive in-person strategies limiting scalability and practicality for the most
marginalized of the workforce. Additionally, the literature on resilience programs are largely from preliminary
studies that lack of a priori sample size calculations, diversity of participants, and long-term maintenance
following the intervention, as well as inadequate control groups, which limits translation prompting calls for more
rigorous designs to evaluate the efficacy of these programs. Consistent with the aim of PAR-24-086 to test a
fully remotely delivered clinical trial with no in-person contact, this team has developed and translated the Stress
Management and Resilience Training (SMART) program for web-based delivery. Our pilot work demonstrates
feasibility, usability, satisfaction, and initial efficacy of the brief self-paced web-based learning sessions (1 hour
per week) with only 5-10 minutes of daily practice suggesting a fully powered study is timely and warranted. An
adequately powered, cluster randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of the web-based SMART program
compared to a matched attention control in a high-need, diverse, and under-resourced and under-studied
segment of essential workers – childcare workers - will be conducted. Participants (640 childcare workers from
80 childcare centers) will be randomly assigned to either SMART or a matched attention control condition with
the primary outcome of mean change in resilience assets and resources (Connor-Davison Resilience Scale).
Measures will be collected at four timepoints: baseline (0 months), post-intervention (3 months), and long-term
maintenance (9 and 15 months). Secondary outcomes will include changes in overall mental health, negative
and positive mental health indicators, social support, and organizational assets and resources. Additionally, we
will explore potential moderators’ (e.g., sociodemographic, social determinants of health) influence on treatment
effects. The RE-AIM Framework will be used to determine reach and representativeness, and potential for
organizational level adoption, implementation, and maintenance of the SMART program. This study fills key
research gaps of previous resilience work in an underserved population in critical need of mental health and
well-being resources with implications for the feasibility and impact of remote programming in other marginalized

11041214,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
There is no change to the proposed work outlined in the parent R35 proposal (R35GM150481).
The integrity of the proteome is constantly being challenged. To maintain protein homeostasis, cells rely heavily
on highly integrated protein networks to provide surveillance and ensure proteins do not become susceptible to
aggregation, a driver of human neurological diseases and cancers. Paramount to these networks are molecular
chaperones and their regulators, which assist in protein folding, transport, and degradation. As the diversity of
proteins that require these chaperones increases, we have gained a broader understanding of the importance
of these regulators across many cellular processes. Recently, we discovered molecular chaperones also
influence cell metabolism by acting on key metabolic enzymes within glycolysis and purine biosynthesis to
efficiently produce the necessary biomolecules critical for their survival and proliferation. However, our
knowledge of how chaperones recognize and act on these enzymes remains largely elusive. The proposed
studies combine super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, biochemical and molecular biology tools, and
proteomic analyses to investigate the how chaperones regulate commonly observed phenomena across
metabolic pathways including the formation of phase separated metabolic enzyme assemblies to facilitate
substrate channeling, the folding of large multi-domain enzymes to drive tightly coupled activities, and the
induced degradation of metabolic enzymes by chaperone-mediated autophagy. These findings will deepen our
fundamental understanding of how cells respond to changes in nutrient availability to meet biomass demand,
provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of dysregulation that drive disease, and inspire new therapeutic
strategies targeting cell metabolism."
11042616,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Multiple lines of clinical and experimental evidence suggest that seizures in early life can be
associated with long lasting cognitive and behavioral deficits. In rodent models, we have showed that early
life seizures (ELS) impair normal synaptic plasticity, critical period plasticity, later life learning and social
behavioral deficits. Improved understanding as to how seizure activity and hyperexcitable networks
dysregulate synaptic plasticity will be required to develop new therapeutic strategies in this clinical space
where no current cure exists.
 We will focus on dysplasticity related to alterations of the excitatory synaptic glutamate receptor and
its related signaling pathways. Tracking alterations of synaptic glutamate receptors in neurons activated by
ELS is a specific challenge given that they occur in the midst of the synaptic critical period, the refinement of
synaptic connections and the dispersion of neurons with development, which makes it difficult to localize
neurons for functional studies later in life, despite the persistence of impaired synaptic plasticity and
cognitive deficits. Similarly, sampling of a neuronal population for gene and protein expression may fail to
show alterations occurring in a small, critical, subset of cells. To address these issues, we have adapted a
method to permanently label cells activated by ELS in mice so that we can measure synaptic responses,
gene and protein expression at a single neuron level, and then differentially label them during subsequent
later life seizure (LLS) events. Using our ELS models, we aim to determine whether neurons activated by
ELS have persistent, life-long, alterations of glutamate receptor function associated with impaired synaptic
plasticity and hyperexcitability compared to neurons from no-seizure control mice (Aim 1). We will correlate
these functional changes with measurements of gene and protein expression related to glutamate receptor
function compared to neurons from no-seizure control mice (Aim 2). Finally, we will determine whether
neurons activated by ELS are differentially affected by a second later life seizure (LLS) in adulthood
compared to control neurons in seizure free mice (Aim 3). The synapse is a convergence point for the
likely many upstream derangements of network function, and therefore an ideal target of study. We
hypothesize that tracking the evolution of changes over time in select neuronal populations following ELS will
allow us to both “stage” the evolution of changes and identify new therapeutic targets for this comorbidity and
consequence of seizures in the immature brain."

The MOLAR study uses a hybrid effectiveness-implementation study to perform a randomized controlled trial
of an intervention to reduce unmet oral health and social needs in the ED, while collecting information to inform
subsequent implementation strategies. In this mixed-methods supplement, we build on the work of the MOLAR
study to understand how geographically-proximate resources and navigational assistance moderate adverse
social determinants of health (aSDoH) and oral health outcomes, and what barriers remain. In particular, we
intend to explore facilitators and barriers at the patient level (Aim 1), system level (Aim 2), and combine this
knowledge with quantitative results to identify the conditions that contribute to successful ED-based oral health
linkage (Aim 3). This work would provide key generalizable insights for how to optimize ED based aSDoH and
oral health interventions. In doing so, we fulfill two of the primary goals of the NIDCR Strategic Plan: (1)
Enabling “precise and personalized oral health care” by developing a model to identify patients at risk in the ED
and facilitating their connection to local, accessible, community oral health care; and (2) Using
“multidisciplinary research approaches to overcome disparities and inequalities” by using the ED to enroll
patients who do not otherwise have access to oral health care and ensure that they are connected to
appropriate community resources for their social needs and oral health care. By doing so, we understand and
address the potential drivers of poor oral health and the challenges around accessibility of oral health care. Our
long-term goal is to reduce the burden of untreated oral disease in vulnerable populations by integrating
screening and referral for oral health and aSDoH into ED care."
11041412,"Stark, Ruth E. Molecular Drivers of FABP-mediated Endocannabinoid Signaling for Appetite Regulation
[unchanged from original proposal submission]
 Metabolic signaling by endogenous cannabinoids (ECs) is essential to the regulation of human
appetite, pain, and neuroprotection. Fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) can either sequester the
hydrophobic ECs or transport them to hydrolytic enzymes; ECs routed to the nucleus also activate the
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). EC levels have been correlated with obesity in
knockout mice for liver (L) FABP that is co-expressed with intestinal (I) FABP in enterocytes and also for
PPARa knockouts, underscoring the regulatory roles of these proteins. We will probe poorly understood
EC-FABP, EC-PPAR, and FABP-EC-PPAR complexes in vitro at near-physiological concentrations,
determining affinities, metabolic fates, molecular binding interfaces, and conformational changes to test
mechanistic hypotheses regarding EC signaling. Trainees at multiple career stages, including those
recruited from underrepresented groups in STEM, will be integrally involved in this research program.
 Specific questions to be addressed are as follows: (1) How do ECs choose between FABP
chaperones to produce obese or lean outcomes? The possibility that ECs are delivered by LFABP to
hydrolytic enzymes for metabolic breakdown rather than sequestered by IFABP in the enterocyte will be
tested enzymatically, whereas the rationale for LFABP’s diminished affinity will be explored using high-
pressure solution-state NMR to identify energetically favored candidate sites for binding. (2) Could
transcriptional activity be driven by EC binding preferences for LFABP vs. PPARa? The PPARa
ligand-binding domain (PPARa_LBD) will be purified, rigorously delipidated, and tested in vitro for EC-
modulated transcriptional activity. EC binding affinities will be compared for PPARa_LBD and FABPs.
(3) Could transcriptional activity be driven by EC-modulated FABP-PPAR collisions that cause
conformational changes? To determine the interactions involved in the proposed FABP-mediated EC
activation of PPARa transcriptional function, we will first use surface plasmon resonance to measure the
binding affinity of LFABP-PPARa_LBD protein complexes, on their own and in the presence of ligands
with a range of known activation efficacies. The site-specific collision-associated impact on the LFABP
partner will be probed by solution-state NMR spectroscopy of the [U-15N]-enriched protein, using chemical
shift perturbations of each backbone NH resonance to define the binding interface with PPARa_LBD, any
allosteric structural changes that occur upon complex formation, and their modulation by EC ligands. Taken
together, these experiments will advance our understanding of (macro)molecular networks that function to
achieve metabolic signaling by ECs involved in appetite and pain regulation, thereby advancing our
understanding of health risks related to obesity and inflammation. This understanding can guide the design
of drugs that modulate these biomedically important ligand-protein and protein-protein interactions.

 The research proposed here will address the following gaps in knowledge: 1) the role of placental
microRNAs in early-childhood growth and metabolism; 2) the genetic and epigenetic dynamics that underlie
microRNA expression in placenta; and 3) the role of placental and extracellular breastmilk microRNAs as
mediators of maternal metabolic status influence on early childhood metabolic status. My research will provide
insight into the contribution of gestational and early-life exposures in the development of early growth and
metabolic status. More broadly, the knowledge gained through this research study has the potential to
contribute to microRNA biology, placental biology, obesity and to the Developmental Origins of Health and

11039382,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Salient signals, like aversive stimulation and reward, should be faithfully detected, and processed by the
nervous system to generate an adaptive action. One of the universal circuit mechanisms linked to salient signal
processing in cortical operation is the activation of dis-inhibitory neurons by subcortical afferents. Aversive
signals and reward delivery profoundly excite cortical GABAergic interneurons expressing vasoactive intestinal
polypeptide (VIP), which selectively inhibit other GABAergic interneurons, leading to the dis-inhibition of
cortical pyramidal cells. In this project, we propose to reveal the functional diversity of VIP interneurons in a
cortical structure. The central idea of our project rests on our earlier anatomical findings that distinct groups of
VIP interneurons innervate different types of GABAergic interneurons, observations that prompted us to
suggest a heterogeneity in their activity during various cortical processes. However, recent imaging studies
reported rather similar activity of VIP interneurons following aversive and appetitive stimuli. In contrast to these
in vivo imaging data, our preliminary experiments obtained in a frontal cortical area of anesthetized mice have
revealed a considerable heterogeneity in VIP interneuron spiking upon delivery of foot shocks. Building on
these preliminary results, our goal is to determine the functional complexity of cortical VIP interneurons,
including their connectivity and operation in awake mice. To achieve these aims, we will combine viral
techniques, neuroanatomical methods, in vivo and in vitro electrophysiology with optogenetics in three different
genetically modified mouse lines. The results of this project will uncover the heterogeneity of spike responses
generated by genetically defined dis-inhibitory VIP interneurons upon salient signal delivery and their
downstream effects on postsynaptic partners within the local microcircuits. Our project will reveal the
complexity of dis-inhibitory circuit motifs in cortical networks, which may be a general phenomenon in a cortex-
wide manner. In addition, our results will help form novel concepts underlying the pathological operation of
cortical circuits linked to deficits in attention and salient signal detection that typifies many malfunctional
cognitive processes, including those observed in schizophrenia, autism, and attention deficit."
11042466,"Project Summary – Restoring Sight to the Blind: Neural Imaging with Retinal Prostheses
 Retinal prostheses restore sight to the blind by electrically stimulating still viable cells in the
retina. These devices consist of a microstimulator array attached to the retina that is driven by video
input from a glasses-mounted camera. Retinal prostheses have been shown to restore basic visual
functions such as the recognition of shapes and rudimentary navigation. However, patients show
significant variability in visual skills, and currently fall short of expected visual capabilities.
 The postdoctoral research proposed in this study focuses on explaining these patient limitations
by investigating the sensory reorganization that occurs during blindness. Neural reorganization during
blindness enables auditory and tactile tasks to be processed in visual brain regions. This type of
reorganization in brain sensory regions was shown to be a key limiting factor in the use of the cochlear
implant for artificial audition. In Aims 1 and 2 of this proposal, Dr. Noelle Stiles will evaluate blindness-
induced cortical reorganization and adaptation with neural imaging in retinal prosthesis patients, which
in turn could allow for better selection of patients for visual restoration.
 Dr. Stiles’ postdoctoral work is also focused on investigating the interaction of artificial vision
with the natural senses, such as audition. Her research has already shown that artificial vision
influences auditory localization in ways similar to natural vision’s influence on audition. In Aim 3, she
will expand this research to determine whether enhanced auditory and tactile perception developed
during blindness are retained or reduced following the restoration of vision. This project will provide a
more complete understanding of blind brain reorganization and the effects of artificial vision.
 Aim 1 will be completed during the K99 phase (pilot data collection is complete). Aims 2 and 3
will continue through the K99 and R00 phases, allowing for fellow training and data piloting.
 The proposed research is designed to prepare Dr. Stiles for successful transition to a tenure-
track faculty position. She will receive training in structural neural imaging data collection, processing,
and visualization from Prof. Yonggang Shi. She will also be trained in ophthalmological retinal imaging
by her principal mentor Prof. Vivek R. Patel at USC, and in biomedical engineering by her co-mentor
Prof. James D. Weiland at the University of Michigan. All of these fields are critical to the study of visual
prostheses. She will be mentored by an advisory committee including Profs. Mark S. Humayun, Arthur
W. Toga, and Yonggang Shi. Both USC and Michigan have retinal prosthesis implantation and
behavioral testing programs involving clinicians, engineers, and visual neuroscientists, in addition to

The goal of this proposal is to investigate the novel role of HAs in healthy cognitive aging and VCI associated
with chronic hypertension. Our preliminary and published data show that HAs were hyperconstricted and had
impaired vasodilatory function in a rat model of chronic hypertension. Further, hippocampal perfusion was
significantly reduced and memory impaired during chronic hypertension that occurred as a function of age.
Importantly, HA dysfunction preceded these changes in perfusion and memory function, suggesting
hypertension-induced memory decline is vascular in nature. Our central hypothesis is that chronic hypertension
progressively decreases the vasodilatory function of HAs that reduces resting and activity-dependent changes
in hippocampal perfusion, resulting in neuronal injury and VCI. Aim 1 will investigate HA endothelial and vascular
smooth muscle function, including vasoconstrictive and vasodilatory pathways, in normotensive and
hypertensive rats by studying isolated and pressurized HAs in vitro. Circulating potent vasoconstrictors (e.g.
angiotensin II, endothelin-1, tumor necrosis factor alpha) that are elevated during chronic hypertension and
cause oxidative stress and damage endothelium will be investigated as underlying mechanisms by which chronic
hypertension causes hyperconstriction and impaired vasodilation of HAs. Aim 2 will investigate progressive
changes in hippocampal perfusion and neurovascular coupling – the innate ability of the brain to increase local
blood flow in response to neuronal activity – as it relates to neuronal function and memory in normotensive and
hypertensive rats across the lifetime. We will determine the role of HAs in age- and hypertension-induced
changes in hippocampal hemodynamics by investigating if therapeutically improving HA function prevents
perfusion deficits, protects hippocampal neurons and slows cognitive decline to be similar to normal aging. This
proposal will use both male and post-menopausal female rats to investigate sex differences in hypertension-
induced HA dysfunction, and whether one sex is more susceptible to age- or hypertension-induced changes in
hippocampal neurovascular function. The outcome of these studies will provide an understanding of the
involvement of the hippocampal vasculature in memory decline associated with normal aging, and how this may
be accelerated during chronic hypertension and contribute to VCI."

In response to the widening rural-urban cancer mortality gap in the US, our parent research project aimed to
improve access to comprehensive cancer care in rural communities by extending the resources and expertise of
a large academic medical center out to a network of rural community cancer centers to improve the quality and
comprehensiveness of care across the cancer continuum, from diagnosis and treatment to survivorship
services. This initiative holds particular significance for Iowa, which, like other rural states, has witnessed a
surge in cancer incidence coupled with rising prevalence of cancer survivors. The primary aim of the parent
grant was to effectively implement an adapted affiliate cancer network model to meet the unique needs of rural
Iowa cancer centers. Building on our progress, this current supplement leverages the mentoring skills of our
Principal Investigator (PI) to promote the sustainability of our network intervention and develop the next
generation of rural cancer researchers. Having already identified the importance of adapting evidence-based
interventions to meet the needs of rural cancer center administrators and providers, our first supplemental
objective is to host a novel cancer survivorship workshop designed specifically for rural providers,
administrators, and policymakers. Under the mentorship of our PI, two early-stage investigators in the fields of
implementation science and disparities research will lead efforts to adapt and implement a rural cancer
survivorship workshop from a model created at the University of Iowa Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center.
This rural cancer survivorship workshop is poised to bolster the capacity of stakeholders within the Iowa
Cancer Affiliate Network (I-CAN) to deliver cancer survivorship services in their rural communities. The
second mentoring aim of this supplemental proposal aims to continue efforts ensuring that rural cancer
survivorship research translates to effective rural policy and practice. To promote effective engagement with
policymakers, the PI will mentor an early-stage rural cancer research trainee and equip him with the skills to
communicate and network with a broader public policymaking audience. The mentee will be integrated into
the PI’s extensive network of academic, healthcare, and policymaking leaders in Iowa, facilitating the creation
and distribution of rural cancer equity products to key decision-making stakeholders. At the end of the
supplemental grant, the mentee will disseminate reports to policy makers in each of Iowa’s 99 counties (78
being rural). By detailing the cancer burden of their specific county, policymakers will be better equipped to
prioritize cancer prevention and control strategies. The parent research project represents a collaborative
effort, featuring a diverse research team committed to addressing the challenges facing rural patients and
cancer centers. This proposal supplements our novel intervention to promote its sustainability and cultivate the
next generation of rural cancer leaders, advancing the NIH’s mission to create a more diverse workforce."
11039116,"The increasing availability and scale of omics data have revolutionized our ability to
understand complex biological processes underlying health and disease. Such
biologically informed insights are aligned with the notion of precision medicine and have
the potential to improve diagnoses, prevention, and treatment. In the oral health domain,
multiple omics data layers (e.g., genomics, metagenomics, transcriptomics,
metabolomics), intended to capture aspects of otherwise unobservable biology, are
increasingly being collected in oral health studies. However, methods for powerful and
informative integration of information gained from these multiple data layers remains
elusive. The focus of this proposal, early childhood caries (ECC), is the most common
non-communicable childhood disease. ECC is defined as dental decay in children under
the age of 6. It remains a clinical and dental public health problem and confers
substantial and multi-level human and economic impacts. The advent of precision oral
health care, based upon a new, microbially-informed understanding of ECC, is expected
to shed light onto mechanistic aspects of the disease processes and reveal new ways to
prevent it. We propose to develop new statistical methods and machine learning (ML)
strategies that handle high dimensionality and excess zeros in comprehensive
integrative analyses of metagenomics (MTG), metatranscriptomics (MTX), and
metabolomics (MTB) and apply them to characterize the ECC-related supragingival
biofilm dysbioses, biochemical activities, and their interactions in a community-based
sample of 300 preschool-age children, enrolled in a large-scale investigation of early
childhood oral health in North Carolina. We propose to develop statistical methods to
jointly identify regulatory modules across MTG, MTX, and MTB associated with ECC.
Furthermore, we seek to develop interpretable machine learning approaches to predict
binary (e.g., case status) or quantitative ECC experience (e.g., dmfs index) using MTG,
MTX, and/or MTB. We anticipate that our study will provide novel insights into the
microbial basis of ECC, identify microbial and biochemical disease biomarkers, highlight
potential targets for prevention and treatment, and establish a powerful research
platform that can be extended to characterize other microbiome-related diseases."
11039520,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Effective mentorship is a critical component for academic and career development, particularly for trainees
underrepresented (UR) in the biomedical workforce. The Mount Sinai Post-Baccalaureate Research Education
Program (PREP) has a long history of successfully training UR scholars for biomedical graduate programs (e.g.,
PhD or Md-PhD). This important work requires dedicated time and effort to adequately support the unique needs
of UR trainees, who may need more support and attention. Substantial data reveals that racial and other biases
persist in biomedical education. For example, a 2022 Pew Research study found that nearly half of all Black
workers in STEM (48%) experienced mistreatment in their STEM education, with over one-third reporting that
someone treated them as if they could not understand scientific concepts (34%) or made them feel as though
they did not belong in STEM (34%). There is growing recognition that higher rates of attrition among racial/ethnic
graduate students will hamper efforts to diversify our biomedical workforce – efforts that are critical to our ability
to conduct high-level science and deliver optimal health care. Cultivating a culture of inclusivity and psychological
safety within the research training environment are important components to developing a diverse biomedical
workforce. Thus, the goal of the proposed supplement is to enhance the Mount Sinai PREP in two ways: 1) well-
being and psychosocial support for trainees and 2) additional anti-racism and -bias training for faculty mentors.
The proposed activities will provide unmet psychosocial support for our PREP trainees by offering opportunities
to discuss their mental and emotional well-being as URM trainees, and mentor training specific to mitigating
racism and racial stereotypes for program faculty. We will accomplish these goals by partnering with faculty from
the Mount Sinai Center for Scientific Diversity (CSD) who will lead monthly group discussions with PREP trainees
on relevant well-being topics including scientific identity, sense of belonging, imposter phenomenon and
resilience. Additionally, PREP faculty mentors will participate in a 5-week mentor training workshop (1.5-hour
sessions) lead by CSD faculty. The workshop curriculum will teach mentors practical strategies for mitigating
racism and racial stereotypes in their research labs as well as within their mentor-mentee relationships.
Outcomes will be evaluated at the individual level (i.e., PREP trainees and faculty mentors) and program level
(e.g., number of participants) for each component (e.g., mentor training and well-being discussion sessions).
Our long-term goal is to impact the research experiences of our PREP trainees and the overall effectiveness of
our PREP program. If proven successful, we will obtain institutional support to sustain the proposed activities in
both Mount PREP and across all research training programs within the institution."
11036803,"Abstract/Summary:
Relapse is a barrier in addiction treatment, and stress is a precipitating stimulus. α2-adrenergic receptor (AR)
agonists can block stress-induced reinstatement of drug-seeking in animal models, particularly through their
actions in a region of the brain known as the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). However, in the
previous funding period we found unexpected pro-reinstatement actions of these receptors which may limit the
clinical effectiveness of α2-AR agonists. Moreover, the finding that pro-reinstatement α2a-ARs exist provides a
potential way to determine neuronal circuits controlling reinstatement. We also found that α2a-ARs in the BNST
induce an unexpected form of neuronal excitation despite coupling to “inhibitory” Gi heterotrimeric G-proteins,
and that this excitation may participate in inducing reinstatement of drug-associated behaviors. Thus, we
hypothesize that a BNST neuronal ensemble is excited by the α2-AR agonist guanfacine to drive reinstatement
of drug-associated behavior. We propose experiments in this application to 1) determine the functional circuitry
of BNST cells activated through this process, 2) test the hypothesis that this excitation occurs by decreased
cyclic AMP signaling to alter the function of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide gated channels in
these cells, and 3) directly test the hypothesis that these cells drive reinstatement of drug-associated
behaviors. The successful completion of these studies will facilitate rational choices regarding therapeutics
likely to reduce stress-induced drug seeking behavior."
11036635,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are at the top of a hierarchy of differentiating progenitor
cells that can reconstitute the entire blood and immune system. Proper regulation of HSC differentiation is critical
during homeostasis and response to stress or infection. Dysregulation of HSCs naturally occurs during aging,
and aberrant differentiation can cause blood cancers and other diseases. Decades of research have been
devoted to understanding and defining the hierarchy of HSC differentiation. However, the limitations of current
biological tools and animal models has left key questions unanswered. Foremost, we have not been able to track
individual HSCs and multipotent progenitors (MPPs), directly and continuously, in their endogenous
microenvironment. Previously, HSCs and MPPs in mouse models could only be identified by dissociation of bone
marrow, labeling with antibodies to detect markers of differentiated lineages (Lin) and at least four other markers;
for example, c-Kit (aka Kit or CD117), Sca-1 (aka Ly6a), CD48, CD150 (aka Slamf1). More recently, single color
transgenic HSC reporter lines have labeled a proportion of HSCs that could be detected by intravital imaging,
but without additional markers for MPPs, the dynamics of HSC fate decisions are lost. We hypothesize that newly
discovered combinations of cell type-specific markers will allow live tracking of HSC/MPP behaviors and key
lineage decisions. The convergence of multiple cutting-edge technologies makes it possible to address this
hypothesis by generating a multi-color, multi-loci mouse reporter system in the following aims. Aim 1) Generate
an HSC/MPP reporter mouse by targeting knock-in 2A fusion reporters to four loci. We will use
CRISPR/Cas9-dependent homology directed repair (HDR) in mouse zygotes, with repair template delivered by
adeno-associated virus (AAV). Each locus will retain functional proteins that cleave to express distinct fluorescent
proteins (e.g., BFP, GFP, tdTomato, iRFP), representing a positive or negative marker for HSCs and/or MPPs.
Aim 2) Characterize the HSC/MPP reporter line using complementary assays to assess faithful labeling
of HSCs and MPPs. After knock-in validation, we will interbreed the lines to generate four color transgenics.
Labeled HSCs and MPPs will be quantified by flow cytometry and functionally validated by limiting dilution
transplantation. Bones will be imaged ex vivo to confirm that spatial maps of endogenously labeled HSCs and
MPPs are consistent with published immunolabeling data. Outstanding questions about the migration of HSCs
and MPPs will be answered by intravital microscopy. Our research proposal fits this funding opportunity because
it represents a significant “improvement of animal models for stem cell-based regenerative medicine.” It
addresses the research interests of multiple NIH Institutes and Centers because the models generated would
apply to the basic biology of the blood system (NHLBI), immune cells (NIAID), aging hematopoiesis (NIA), HSC
biology (NIDDK), and blood cancers (NCI). As blood and immune cells interact with all tissues of the body, our
models will be used to evaluate “processes that impact multiple body or organ systems.”"
11042485,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Craniofacial anomalies account for one third of all birth defects and are a significant cause of infant mortality.
Neural crest cells (NCC) give rise to the majority of craniofacial bone, cartilage, and connective tissue and un-
derstanding their development is crucial for advancing the prevention of craniofacial birth defects. Disruptions
in NCC development are known to underlie several craniofacial disorders including Treacher Collins syndrome,
which is caused by mutations in TCOF1, POLR1B, POLR1C, and POLR1D. POLR1C and POLR1D are subu-
nits of both RNA Polymerases (Pol) I and III and are important for transcription of ribosomal RNA. I previously
demonstrated in polr1c and polr1d zebrafish models that ribosomal RNA transcription is reduced leading to
Tp53-dependent cell death of NCC progenitors which results in craniofacial anomalies. However, how global
disruptions in polr1c and polr1d specifically affect NCC development remains unresolved and the contribution
of Pol III, which transcribes non-coding RNAs including 5S ribosomal RNA and transfer RNAs, to craniofacial
development is not known. I hypothesize that in addition to disruption of Pol I transcription in the pathogenesis
of Treacher Collins syndrome, Pol III transcription is also disrupted and contributes to the tissue-specific phe-
notypes observed. Transcripts produced by Pol III, including tRNAs, have been shown in multiple systems to
be tissue-specifically expressed. To generate a new understanding of the role of Pol III transcription specifically
in NCC, I will receive training in profiling NCC for changes in Pol III transcripts and in evaluating the effect of
these changes on translation. It has been postulated that distinct pathogenic variants in POLR3A, the largest
subunit of Pol III, lead to differential effects on Pol III transcription. In order to test this hypothesis in a NCC-
specific manner, I will use hiPSCs derived from patient fibroblasts with pathogenic variants in POLR3A and
analyze them for proliferation, translation, differentiation, and Pol I and III transcription. Given the prevalence of
dental anomalies in individuals with mutations in POLR3A, I expect to identify Pol III-specific effects in a subset
of NCC derivatives. In the independent phase of this award, I will generate new zebrafish models to under-
stand the role of specific variants in Pol III in a developmental context and assess NCC formation, migration,
differentiation, and proliferation in combination with the effect on Pol I and III transcription. These models will
provide new resources to the research community for the understanding of Pol III transcription. Altogether, I
will receive the training necessary to analyze Pol III transcription and translation and model patient-specific var-
iants in NCC which will form the foundation of my independent research program and further my goal of under-
standing and preventing craniofacial birth defects."

The human body hosts multiple complex microbial ecosystems consisting of bacteria, archaea, viruses, and
fungi — collectively referred to as the microbiota. The microbiota impact human health and are associated with
a wide variety of complex diseases. Therefore, understanding how the microbiota is maintained across the
body is of major importance. My research program focuses on investigating the factors responsible for
microbiota composition in the human host and determining how the microbiome influences human health.
Specifically, I tackle these questions from the perspective of a human geneticist. I treat the microbiome as a
complex trait and use human genetic approaches to understand its genetic underpinnings. Recent work from
myself and others revealed the effect of host genetics in fecal microbiome composition. Major gaps in our
understanding of microbiome heritability remain, however, which I aim to tackle in my lab. For example, we
lack an understanding of whether host genetics impacts microbiota directly adjacent to mucosal surfaces, what
the underlying host physiological mechanisms are, and whether host genetics influences the eukaryotic
viruses, fungi, or other single-cell eukaryotic organisms in the microbiota, as the bacterial and archaeal
components of the microbiota have been the focus to date. Research in my lab seeks to address these gaps
by developing and applying a combination of microbiome and functional genomic research methods to gain a
better understanding of the physiological underpinnings of host-microbiota interactions across the body. Over
the next five years I will lead projects under three broad themes: (1) identify relationships between host genes
and mucosal bacterial and archaeal abundance, (2) identify non-prokaryotic elements of the microbiota
associated with human gene expression, and (3) determine causal relationships between the microbiome and
host traits across two distinct body sites: gut and lung. Specifically, my efforts will focus on physiologically
relevant sampling, including pairing sequencing of the microbiota from lung and gut mucosal surfaces with
single-cell RNA-seq of adjacent host tissues. Using these data, I will identify individual microbial taxa, host cell
types, and host pathways important for maintaining cross-kingdom interactions in healthy individuals. By
examining two distinct organ systems, I will identify components both shared across and unique to the host
tissue type. Application of genetic epidemiological methods and confirmation in vitro will establish direction of
causality: Which aspects of the microbiota drive changes in gene expression in the host, and vice versa?
Results from my research program will provide insights into the physiological mechanisms that underlie
heritability of the microbiota. Ultimately, this will improve our understanding of host control of the microbiome
and provide insight into which elements of the microbiome could be targeted for therapeutic benefit."

11042917,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Almost half of the human genome is composed of repetitive DNA elements, and about three percent of
the genome is composed of microsatellites, short tandem repeats of 1-6 DNA bases. Many repeat sequences
can form alternative DNA structures that interfere with replication and repair. This can lead to disease-causing
repeat expansions, such as the CAG/CTG expansions that cause Huntington’s disease, myotonic dystrophy,
and many spinocerebellar ataxias. Breaks within structure-forming repeats cause chromosome deletions and
rearrangements, which are common in cancer cells undergoing replication stress. The goal of my laboratory is
to study mechanisms of genome instability caused by structure-forming repeats, and to elucidate cellular
pathways that have evolved to prevent these deleterious mutations. We recently discovered that long tracts of
structure-forming CAG repeats relocate to the nuclear periphery to facilitate replication through the tract and
prevent chromosome breakage and repeat expansions. This pathway depends on modification of proteins at
the replication fork by sumoylation, and subsequent interaction of the sumoylated proteins with components of
the nuclear pore complex (NPC) in late S phase, followed by release back into the nuclear interior in G2 phase.
Recent data shows that this pathway is relevant for several types of replication barriers, including protein
blocks and other structure-forming repeats. Therefore, it is vital to better understand the purpose of this
relocation to the NPC and its role in facilitating replication and preventing genome instability, which is our long-
term goal.
 We have developed a system to follow the location of an expanded CAG tract or other structure-
forming repeat in the cell nucleus using microscopy, complemented by biochemical techniques to detect
proteins interacting with the repeat locus. We will use the budding yeast (S. cerevisiae) system which allows us
to combine these approaches with the powerful genetics of the yeast system. Yeast replication and repair
pathways retain a high level of conservation with human cells, but the smaller size of the yeast genome and
proteome and wild-type (non-transformed) state of cells are advantages that will allow us to make significant
scientific progress. We plan to elucidate the purpose of relocation of stalled replication forks to the NPC and
the mechanisms that occur at the NPC to allow restart of replication forks and prevention of chromosome
breaks and repeat instability, using both established and novel approaches. Our goal is to understand NPC-
dependent modification of replisome-associated proteins and fork remodeling that occurs at replication
barriers, and in so doing understand vital cellular processes that maintain genome stability."

Black Emerging Adults (BEA), ages 18-24, in the U.S. experience higher levels of poverty, illness, and
discrimination than White youth. These exposures to harm, coupled with the lack of supportive services to
address and mitigate poverty and structural inequities, result in health inequities. BEA experience high mental
health service needs, but much less service utilization than White youth, have higher rates of STI and less
access to family planning. Disrupting the social determinants of poverty that systematically affects BEA, can
have a transformative impact on a healthy transition into adulthood during a critical time in their development.
Guaranteed basic income (GBI) is an economic strategy that could redress financial inequities and transform
the mental and physical health outcomes of BEA, which has shown tremendous promise in adults populations
and youth in families receiving income, but little is known about how GBI program would work when cash is
transferred unconditionally and directly to Black emerging adults and what critical supports would be needed to
ensure GBI is most effective. We propose a randomized controlled crossover trial in which 300 low-income
BEA are allocated to receive a $500/month GBI either during the first twelve months of follow-up (phase I) or to
receive GBI in the second 12 months of a total of 24 months follow-up (phase II). All participants, regardless of
randomization arm, will be offered enrollment in financial capability programs -- peer learning circles and
financial coaching -- to bolster GBI effectiveness. Participants will also receive a cell phone-based real-time
monitoring and response intervention (RTMR), which will ensure that BEA with unmet health service needs
receive referrals. The RTMR system will simultaneously provide critical, time-sensitive information for
community agencies and policy makers to address documented service gaps. All components will be co-
designed and monitored by our Community Working Group, comprised of representatives from an extensive
network of partnering community agencies, city officials, and youth who have been active in the financial
capability space. Together these intervention components support BEA on the individual-level (GBI, coaching,
RTMR), interpersonal-level (peer learning circles), community-level (GBI & RTMR), and at the societal level
(policy impacts of GBI, RTMR). We will determine the impacts of GBI and GBI+multi-level supports on BEA’s
investment in their future (education, employment training), mental health (depressive symptoms and anxiety),
and unmet mental health and sexual/reproductive health service needs. We will also include a nested
qualitative component to explore mechanisms of impact on financial, mental and physical health. This study
leverages a strong multi-disciplinary community and research partnership; multilevel intervention components
that address the most urgent inequities that impact the trajectory of BEA during their transition to adulthood
and independence; and provides urgent experimental data with findings that could inform service provision and
policy to advance health equity."

Community-based surveillance studies of respiratory viruses provide the opportunity for early viral detection
and situational awareness, and may inform early public health efforts to mitigate the transmission of respiratory
viruses, as was evidenced by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Case-ascertained household transmission studies
are an efficient and epidemiologically rich method to study respiratory virus transmission. Our team of
investigators has deep expertise in community surveillance and case-ascertainment trials of respiratory
viruses. Our group of collaborators include specialists in infectious diseases, epidemiology, biostatistics,
virology, immunology, and infectious disease modeling. In 2018, we developed the infrastructure for a
pandemic preparedness platform in Seattle, Washington, leading to the first identification of SARS-CoV-2
community transmission in the United States. We have developed innovative methods for fully remote
observational studies of respiratory viruses in households, and have built a logistics and laboratory
insfrastructure for rapid delivery and pickup of biospecimens, multiplex testing for a panel of respiratory
pathogens, in-depth immunologic characterization, and whole genome sequencing and visualization. In this
study, we propose to build on these platforms to conduct the following studies. First, we propose a
prospective longitudinal cohort study of 2000 children and adults in the Seattle area, with weekly
symptom screening and collection of nasal swabs for respiratory illness. We will conduct multi-pathogen testing
for respiratory viruses and whole genome sequencing for RSV, SARS-CoV-2, and other respiratory viruses.
We will calculate incidence, assess epidemiology and burden of respiratory viruses, measure participant
knowledge, attitudes and perceptions, and measure the effectiveness of interventions in prevention of disease.
We additionally propose to perform in-depth immunologic assessments by collection of serum samples
longitudinally in a subset of individuals to understand antibody kinetics over the course of multiple seasons,
and the effects of vaccines and infections on antibody titers across age groups. For our second study, we
propose to conduct a case-ascertained household transmission study to understand transmission
dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, RSV, and other viruses. Index cases will be enrolled remotely along with their
household members, for serial self-swab collection for a period of two weeks after enrollment. We propose
collection of environmental samples within a subset of households. Molecular testing and sequencing will be
performed for SARS-CoV-2, RSV, and other viruses, as indicated, allowing for calculation of household attack
rates, serial intervals, and risk factors for within household transmission for known and novel pathogens. These
proposed studies will provide real-time situational awareness of community respiratory epidemiology, and our
team has the experience and expertise to pivot for identification of novel pathogens and pandemic response."

Tendon and ligament injuries are widespread and affect young active to aging individuals. Once
injured, tendons undergo slow and limited healing and never regain their original properties. This
can result in limited mobility, pain associated with movements, and a high propensity for reinjury.
By gaining a mechanistic understanding of the cell types and pathways regulating tendon cells
during their formation, homeostasis, and repair, we hope to identify new potential ways to treat
tendon injuries and improve tendon healing in patients. Studies using mouse genetic approaches
have accelerated tendon research, identifying new tendon cell types and pathways that regulate
formation and healing. Constitutive and inducible tendon recombinase lines, such as Scx-Cre and
Scx-CreERt2, have been instrumental in allowing more tissue-specific gene loss of function
analysis. However, there remain limitations in our ability to target specific subsets of tendon cells
or to target tendons in distinct anatomical regions. Scx-Cre/Scx-CreERt2 as well as other
Cre/CreERt2 lines used to label tendons and ligaments are not specific to these tissues, which
can confound interpretation of cell lineage and functional studies. More specific tools are needed
in order to advance future research and enable studies dissecting specific tendon cell subsets or
anatomical regions. In the neuroscience field, intersectional genetic tools have been used for
more than a decade to target developmentally and molecularly distinct cell networks and dissect
their function. Therefore, we propose to generate new alleles that would enable intersectional
genetic approaches in the tendon and could be applicable to other musculoskeletal tissues. First,
we will generate constitutive and inducible Flp alleles that can be used with a large number of
existing Cre/CreERt2 lines and Flp/Cre indicator alleles for intersectional cell labeling. This would
allow specific targeting of subsets of tendon cells as well as targeting tendons in distinct anatomic
locations. In addition, we propose the generation of two Flp/Cre dual recombinase responsive
alleles for performing functional analysis of the intersecting cell populations via cell ablation or
expression of rtTA, which can be used for functional perturbations when combined with already
available TetO lines. Proper efficiency and specificity of all alleles will be validated using existing
indicator or Cre/Flp lines. Together, the generation of these alleles will permit unprecedented
targeting of specific tendon cell populations for lineage tracing and functional analysis. Their use
by the musculoskeletal community would enable mechanistic studies and advance research with
the goal of impacting the development of future tendon therapies."

Understanding and eliminating TB depends on understanding the host and pathogen dynamics in granulomas,
where the outcomes of M. tuberculosis infection are determined. Despite substantial efforts, the cellular
composition, spatial interactions, and mechanisms that determine outcomes such as pathologic
granuloma necrosis are poorly understood. One explanation for the limited understanding of granulomas is that
most studies are performed in a single experimental system in isolation. We have formed a consortium to
perform and integrate studies of TB granulomas in three systems: humans, rhesus macaques, and new
strains of mice. In these three systems, we will address several major questions in TB granuloma biology:
what is the extent of diversity in cell composition in TB granulomas? What regulates cell trafficking and
spatial interactions in TB granulomas? What are the roles of type I interferons (TIIFN) and interferon
gamma (IFNg) in regulating and determining cell trafficking, differentiation, spatial relationships, and activation
states in TB granulomas? What are the pathogen and host determinants of necrosis, a pathologic outcome,
in TB granulomas? Our primary mode for investigating these and other questions will be high-parameter
multiplex immunostaining of TB granulomas from the three species, as this will provide essential insight into
the spatial relationships between immune cell subsets. Multiplex immunostaining will be complemented by
studies of live imaging of cell dynamics in rhesus macaque granulomas and by strategically-timed transfers
of labeled cells in rhesus macaques and diverse strains of mice. The value of the multiplex immunostaining
studies will be further enhanced by deep characterization of dissociated cell populations at the single-cell
level, using high parameter flow cytometry and single-cell transcriptomics. A uniquely important contribution
of our proposed project is the computational integration of data from humans, rhesus macaques, and new
strains of mice. By integrating multispecies data, we will identify the features of TB granulomas that are
common to all three species, and we will identify factors that are unique to granulomas in each species, to
guide further modifications to improve the utility of studies in animal models. Integration of the data from the
three species will allow studies in rhesus macaques to be compared with those of human samples and
new strains of mice; this will improve the understanding and interpretation of human pathology studies, and
enhance the value of studies that can take advantage of using the unique advantages of mice for mechanistic
studies. Together, our studies will advance the knowledge and understanding of TB biology, and guide
development of interventions to improve treatment outcomes, limit lung damage, and improve lung tissue
repair in people suffering from TB."

Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) is a rare and severe neurocristopathy caused by PHOX2B
gene mutations. CCHS is characterized by profound hypoventilation and autonomic nervous system
dysregulation, necessitating life-long artificial ventilation. Patients may suffer repetitive hypoxemic and
hypercarbic exposure resulting in potential neurocognitive compromise. Autonomic cardiovascular dysfunction
leads to risk of hypertension, blood pressure lability, impaired responses to orthostatic stress, and sinus pauses
often requiring a cardiac pacemaker. Additionally, CCHS is associated with high risk of Hirschsprung’s disease
and tumors of neural crest origin. There is substantial variability in presentation and disease severity and there
is a lack of consensus among expert clinicians on optimal management. Currently, there are no pharmacologic
interventions approved to decrease disease burden in CCHS, and the limited treatment options available are
highly invasive, burdensome and offer only palliative support. Despite promising pre-clinical models, anecdotal
reports of off-label drug successes, and approved drugs and devices in other populations with considerable
potential in CCHS, therapeutic development is hampered by a lack of established measures of disease state
and comprehensive Natural History (NH) data. Factors leading to the wide phenotypic variability in CCHS are
not well understood, and severity stratification criteria are lacking. Importantly, the impact of disease and different
treatment approaches (e.g., tracheostomy vs. mask ventilation) on patient and caregiver quality of life (QOL)
remains unquantified. Addressing these knowledge gaps is critical to advance CCHS treatment and inform
effective therapeutic strategies. Accurate clinical, functional, and quality of life assessments are paramount to
understanding disease progression, stratifying disease severity, formulating effective treatment strategies, and
assessing therapeutic interventions. This proposal assembles preeminent CCHS experts, leading international
CCHS centers of excellence, CCHS patient advocacy groups, and industry partners currently developing
interventions for CCHS to address this gap in the science. Together, this team has identified candidate measures
that reflect the core CCHS phenotype but are lacking validation data. This project will capture extensive,
longitudinal NH data using rigorously defined protocols, common data elements (CDEs), and established
measures reflecting patient and caregiver voices. Ultimately, we will develop a flexible, adaptable data hub of
core measures of CCHS NH which will inform future therapeutic development, intervention trials, research and
clinical care. By merging traditionally siloed CCHS data, expertise, resources and cohorts, this study will enrich
knowledge of CCHS NH, establish measures that best correlate with disease severity, inform therapeutic
development, and accelerate progress toward clinical trials. Recent advances in preclinical models and ongoing
therapeutic development makes this study time-sensitive, and success paramount to advancing toward approved
therapeutics in this underserved population."

 Patients with major mental illness (MMI; major depressive, bipolar, schizophrenia spectrum, other psychotic
disorders; posttraumatic stress disorder) are diagnosed with alcohol use disorder (AUD) at higher rates than the
general population and experience negative consequences and long-term suffering as a result. There are FDA
approved medications for AUD (MAUD) that have demonstrated efficacy. That these medications are underutilized in
MMI patients with comorbid AUD represents a gap in care: evidence-based AUD treatments exist but MMI patients –
many from marginalized racial, ethnic, and SES groups - are largely excluded from benefiting from them. In primary
care and mental health settings, prescribers report that MAUD is best provided in specialty addictions service settings
even though it is hard to connect with these services for MMI patients. However, the psychiatric treatment setting can
easily offer MAUD. Many MMI patients are highly connected to their psychiatry treatment providers. They are taking
psychiatric medications prescribed by their psychiatry treatment team; MAUD could easily be offered and monitored in
this context. APA practice guidelines state that MAUD can have efficacy outside of specialty addictions services.
Services in psychiatry treatment settings are provided by a team in which prescribers focus on medication treatments
in brief monthly appointments and non-prescribing clinicians provide psychosocial interventions in more frequent
appointments. Implementing a process that identifies patients, educates them on MAUD, prescribes MAUD and
monitors use, and integrates MAUD with other psychotherapies offers the best chance for increasing MMI patients’
access to MAUD.
 This project will pilot test an implementation facilitation (IF) intervention to increase MAUD education and
prescribing for MMI/AUD patients in three psychiatry treatment clinics. Guided by the integrated Promoting Action on
Research Implementation in Health Services (i-PARIHS) framework, an external facilitator will work with each clinics’
internal champion to (1) provide clinic level education on MAUD in non-specialty care settings, (2) provide clinic level
training in using a standardized AUD screen, documenting screening results in the EHR, and documenting AUD
diagnosis in the EHR, (3) help internal champions use an audit and feedback system for weekly review of MAUD
education and prescribing, (4) help internal champions do weekly care coordination of MMI/AUD patients, and (5)
make educational materials on MAUD available on site to MMI patients so they are informed about these treatment
options. Internal champions and clinics will have access to consultation from a MAUD clinician expert. These activities
will take place across pre-implementation and implementation phases and will be followed by a post-IF sustainment
period during which clinics and champions continue implementation on their own. Formative Evaluation activities will
take place throughout; at the end of the sustainment phase, MAUD outcomes will be assessed."

Long-lived and directly transmitted parasitic animals are among the most potent agents of natural selection
known from human populations. Yet, there is a fundamental gap in our knowledge of the co-evolutionary
mechanisms producing these patterns. This is, in part, because host-parasite interactions are notoriously difficult
to study. Until remedied, progress toward understanding an elusive process that has profoundly shaped our
biology is impeded. New model host-parasite systems are therefore critical for advancing the field. The long-
term goal of our research is to develop and leverage new model host-parasite models for mechanistic studies of
co-evolution. Over the past nearly four years of ESI MIRA support, we have made considerable progress toward
dissecting the genomic basis of the evolution of parasitism and host specialization, and in determining the extent
to which co-evolutionary interactions maintain genome-wide variation in host and parasite populations. The
rationale is that parasitism evolved repeatedly in the lineage that includes the genetic model animal Drosophila
melanogaster. Conveniently, these parasitic flies complete development in the genetic model plant Arabidopsis
thaliana, facilitating in-depth mechanistic study. In addition to addressing our core objectives, the MIRA’s
transformative flexibility allowed pursuit of risky new leads, resulting in a number of fundamental discoveries of
broad interest to biologists. This included characterization of the first odorant receptors specific to volatile
mustard oil toxins (isothiocyanates or ITCs) known in animals, the first use of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing
technology to fully retrace an adaptive walk in an animal (the mutations sufficient for resistance to cardiac
glycoside toxins in monarch butterflies) using an in vivo knock-in approach, and identification of the first genes
from animals known to encode cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) subunit B proteins, which is our model for the
evolution of toxins used by human immune cells. These discoveries now form the basis of our proposed transition
to EI MIRA support over the next five years. Our specific goal in the next phase of research is to identify the
evolution and mechanistic bases of interactions between hosts and parasites that are mediated by three toxin
classes: ITCs, cardiac glycosides, and CDTs. Three projects already underway that will address this goal are:
(1) the evolution and mechanistic basis of toxin detection by parasites (ITCs), (2) the evolution and mechanistic
basis of toxin resistance by parasites (ITCs and cardiac glycosides), and (3) the evolution and mechanistic basis
of toxin co-option by the immune system (CTDs). This research is expected to inform our understanding of how

11042944,"MECHANISMS OF KINESIN MOTOR PROTEIN INHIBITION
SUMMARY
The spatiotemporal regulation of organelle positioning is critical for proper cellular function, especially as the
cell responds to a changing environment. The kinesin superfamily of motor proteins is responsible for various
cellular processes that range from long-range axonal transport to orchestrating the mitotic spindle during cell
division. The regulation of kinesin motor proteins occurs via inhibitory and activation-based mechanisms,
where kinesin motor proteins are subject to autoinhibition when not bound to a cargo. Recently, the discovery
of kinesin-binding protein (KIFBP) revealed a novel form of kinesin inhibition whereby KIFBP binds to kinesin
motor domains to block microtubule-binding. In this grant, we will determine the molecular basis for
KIFBP-mediated kinesin inhibition in trans and how kinesin light chains in cis-lead to kinesin inhibition. Based
on structural studies of KIFBP bound to two different kinesin motor domains, we developed a model of how
KIFBP remodels kinesin motors and how KIFBP selectively engages motors. We will introduce site-specific
mutagenesis based on crosslinking mass spectrometry and patient-derived mutants to dissect kinesin binding
and remodeling by KIFBP (Aim 1). In parallel, we will determine how light chains regulate full-length kinesin
motor proteins via autoinhibition. Despite decades of work into the regulation of full-length kinesin motor
proteins, there remain conflicting results regarding inhibition of kinesin motor domains. We are poised to
answer this question by exploiting a combination of crosslinking mass spectrometry, protein engineering, and
cryo-EM to determine how kinesin light chains stabilize a compact, inhibited kinesin motor (Aim 2). We will
study both kinesin-1 heterotetramers (KIF5B:KLC1) in addition to kinesin-2 heterotrimers (KIF3A:3B:KAP) to
compare and contrast how these different kinesin motor complexes are autoinhibited. Taken together, this work
will expand our understanding of kinesin regulation, establishing modes of inhibition to provide a complete view
of kinesin activity."

Group 1 CD1 molecules which perform lipid antigen presentation, are expressed in humans but not in mice.
This biological difference leaves a gap in the understanding of the role of lipid antigens role in immunological
homeostasis and disease. The parent award supports a minority scholar in using type 2 diabetes (T2D) as a
model disease to investigate the role of lipid antigen presentation in generating adaptive immune responses
under chronic antigen stimulation. Three research areas explore the hypothesis that lipid antigen presentation
initiates chronic inflammation in T2D. Preliminary data from the parent grant suggest that immune-mediated β-
cell dysfunction, downstream of lipid antigen presentation, may contribute to human T2D development. This
supplement aims to investigate immune cell infiltration and activation in human pancreatic islets from
individuals with and without T2D using imaging mass cytometry. Additionally, it supports ""late bloomer""
undergraduates in gaining research experience, addressing disparities in biomedical sciences. Completion of
this project will provide insights into the immune environment in T2D and pilot a mentorship program for
disadvantaged students."

The cell bodies of vestibular ganglion neurons express a diverse range of ion channels
and neurotransmitter receptors. This diversity provides a rich biophysical substrate for
shaping the intrinsic excitability of individual neurons and expands the populations’
repertoire for sensory signaling. In the vestibular nerve, the temporal precision needed
to code rapid head movements is determined by neurons firing at irregular intervals,
whereas the ability to detect slow head movements sensitively is determined by neurons
firing at regular intervals. Here we test whether the ion channels resident in the
membranes of vestibular neurons produce this important diversity or whether other
specializations of dendritic and synaptic morphology are also needed. The resolution of
this question requires joint characterizations of ion channel composition and dendritic
morphology in individual neurons. To provide this, we will perform patch-clamp
recordings combined with single-cell labeling in semi-intact neuro-epithelium preparations
in which neurons are still connected to their hair cells. Definitive relationships between
ion channel composition and neuronal function cannot be established without considering
the impact of efferent modulation on individual ion channels. Using pharmacology, we
will define the impact of cholinergic efferent signals on two ion channels identified as
being prominent for controlling the firing patterns and excitability of vestibular ganglion
neurons. We will test if some neurons are more receptive to this modulation than others.
Identifying such differences may also reveal opportunities for selectively targeting
therapeutics to specific neuron groups. We will combine the unique joint
characterizations of ion channels and dendritic morphology from our experiments to
create computational models to examine the relative importance of ion channel
composition and dendritic integration on vestibular afferent responses. Overall, our work
integrates powerful computational and experimental approaches to advance our
understanding of a fundamental aspect of vestibular function."

the premier research, data collection, survey, and statistical analysis organizations in the US. This team has
capitalized on our collective experience acquired through successful completion of past and ongoing national
studies addressing blood donor epidemiology and recipient safety using unique access to blood donors’ serial
donation-derived samples, large-scale high throughput blood screening, BCO donor-donation databases,
survey data, and analytics capacity. We will maintain a longitudinal cohort of at least 30,000 donors who are
routinely providing blood samples nationally to support quarterly assessment of ~20,000 samples for antibody
prevalence, median antibody titers, and incidence of infections. We will maintain and enhance our current
nationwide blood donor cohort with sample acquisition, testing, and surveys of ≥2,000 donors in each HHS
region to obtain quarterly estimates for a range of respiratory viruses in each region. The following objectives
will be accomplished for SARS-CoV-2 using established methodologies, with transition to highly multiplexed,
quantitative serology (seroplex) assays to enable additional monitoring of RSV, influenza and other respiratory
viruses: estimate population weighted incidence of infections nationally, by HHS region, and within
demographic subgroups (e.g., by race/ethnicity, sex, age group) including reinfections using seroconversion or
changes in antibody titers in a cohort of repeat blood donors; assess national, regional, and demographic
group-specific immunity and risk of infection through tracking antibody titers; monitor antibody dynamics,
including waning patterns, and measure the ability to neutralize variants with mutations associated with
immune escape; assess demographic and other risk factors for infection in the setting of evolving immunity and
the emergence of newly circulating variants; determine antibody thresholds for protection against infections
and clinical disease including from new variants; use surveys to document vaccinations, symptoms, severe
illness, respiratory virus prevention behaviors, level of exposure to viruses, and attitudes towards respiratory
virus vaccines, prophylactic medications, and/or therapeutics; monitor new and persistent symptoms following
respiratory virus infections to estimate prevalence and clinical significance of post-acute syndromes, stratified
by reported vaccinations and prior infections. This program will expand the established biorepository of
nationally representative samples and enhance seroplex assays enabling investigation of novel respiratory

Recombination is both a means to avoid genome instability and to process that generates genome instability.
In meiosis, DNA double-strand breaks are repaired into crossovers that are essential for accurate
segregation of homologous chromosomes; defects in this process result in sterility or aneuploidy, the major
cause of pregnancy loss and trisomy. Conversely, in mitotically proliferating cells double-strand breaks are a
dangerous class of DNA damage. Repair of breaks in this context is done without making crossovers;
formation of crossovers in mitotic cells can lead to chromosome rearrangements and tumorigenesis.
Research in my laboratory focuses on mechanisms that promote crossovers in meiotic cells and non-
crossover outcomes of repair in mitotic cells. We have made important contributions to understand these
problems for 20 years, during which time I have trained numerous scientists who are active in research and
research-related careers. This proposal sketches out both continued and new directions that will drive the
field forward. These include investigations of how large gaps are repaired (important for designing Cas9
fragment integration experiments and Cas9-based gene drive systems) and how meiotic crossovers are
patterned (important for proper segregation of chromosomes into gametes). We use a combination of
genetics, primarily using Drosophila as a model organism, genomics, biochemistry, cell biology, evolutionary
biology, and mathematical modeling."

11038801,"The Sars-CoV-2 pandemic presented unprecedented challenges in many areas of healthcare.
One important area was accurately forecasting the need for resources such as testing,
vaccinations, and other critical resources that are linked to hospital care. In rural areas, these
issues become even more complex due to increased isolation, health disparities, and social
determinants of health. Rural residents have different social and economic profiles and face
different environmental factors than their urban counterparts. The data collected during the
RADx-Up project provides a unique opportunity to leverage the Common Data Elements (CDE)
to inform and develop the next generation of predictive modeling techniques. West Virginia
(WV), which hosted two unique and highly successful community-based testing, RADx-Up
testing projects, provides a novel testing ground for this development. Furthermore, our RadX
study has unique access to secondary data sources that supplement the two West Virginia
RadX studies, providing the ability to leverage further the RadX Common Data Elements to
develop the next generation of forecasting tools that will be necessary during events like the
Sars-CoV-2 pandemic.
 This study utilizes statewide Sars-CoV-2 testing, vaccination, hospitalization data, and
RadX data from two state-wide West Virginia projects to develop novel behavior-informed multi-
task machine learning frameworks to predict localities for targeted public health interventions.
In the first aim, we utilize the results of the RadX survey data in West Virginia in the context of
the various waves of the pandemic. This will provide insights into behavior changes in how
individuals in various communities sought testing and how it impacted other resources such as
vaccinations. We also view this in the context of the disease severity with access to full-state
testing data and hospitalizations associated with those communities. This will create a
behavioral profile to understand how these behaviors changed over various waves of the
pandemic. In the second aim, we develop novel machine learning frameworks that allow public
health officials and practitioners to include and exploit these insights to create better-targeted
public health interventions. This requires developing new computational and graph-constrained
multi-task machine-learning paradigms that leverage the relationship between outcomes such
as incidence, testing utilization, vaccine uptake, and hospitalization while also considering the
relationships between locations. These methods will generalize beyond Sars-Cov-2 to other
emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases and apply broadly to other public health crises."
11041590,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
 The number of women incarcerated in the United States has increased more than 600% over the past
three decades. At last count, more than 225,000 women – a majority of whom were of reproductive age – were
behind bars. As the number of incarcerated women has risen, so too has the need for prisons to address
women’s health needs, including pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum care. Providing incarcerated pregnant
women with enhanced pregnancy and postpartum supports may improve both maternal and neonatal
outcomes. One promising approach is to use doulas to provide this comprehensive support. As non-medical
companions, doulas provide an array of supports and have been shown to reduce labor length and obstetric
complications, improve maternal satisfaction, and promote breastfeeding initiation among low-income women.
Several state prisons are now partnering with local organizations to offer enhanced pregnancy and postpartum
support; yet, key questions that are critical to successful program expansion remain. The overall objective of
this project is to conduct a multi-state study of enhanced pregnancy and postpartum support programs for
women incarcerated in six geographically-diverse prisons, with the overall goal to provide valuable, practical,
and actionable information to prisons about how to implement pregnancy and postpartum support programs to
promote maternal and neonatal health. We will accomplish this goal by pursuing the three specific aims: 1)
identify facilitators and barriers to implementation of pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum support programs
for women in prison, 2) evaluate the pregnancy and birth outcomes of program participants, and 3) evaluate
the postpartum outcomes of program participants. Results from this study will fundamentally advance our
understanding of pregnancy and postpartum support programs and the maternal and neonatal outcomes
among program participants. Identifying key modifiable factors across prisons that facilitate program
implementation and sustainability and documenting the outcomes of participants across sites will directly
inform ongoing program expansion. Ultimately, this work will yield critical information to address the complex
health needs of pregnant women in prison, reduce health disparities, and promote health equity among justice-
involved women and their infants."
11041277,"Chronic overlapping pain conditions (COPCs) affect over 100 million people, predominantly women. Yet, they
remain ineffectively treated due, in large part, to lack of valid animal models with translational relevance. In
response to FOA PAR-18-763, this proposal seeks to develop a new mouse model of COPCs with improved
external validity to facilitate discovery of neurotherapeutics with analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. Our
model will incorporate key genetic and environmental factors known to contribute to the etiology of COPCs
through enhancing catacholaminergic tone. An estimated 66% of patients with COPCs such as fibromyalgia
have functional variants in the gene encoding catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT; a ubiquitously expressed
enzyme that metabolizes catecholamines), that result in low COMT activity. The effect of COMT genotype on
pain is modified by stress and injury. For example, individuals with the ‘low activity’ COMT genotype report
enhanced pain following stressful events (eg, motor vehicle collision and psychological strain) and injurious
surgical procedures (eg, molar extraction and mastectomy). Low COMT, stress, and injury can produce pain by
increasing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines that sensitize nociceptors. Previously, our lab
employed a pharmacologic approach to study mechanisms and targets driving COMT-dependent pain, yet this
approach does not adequately mimic the complex clinical etiology of COPCs. Thus, the objective of this
proposal is to develop and validate a novel mouse model of COPCS in which genetically predisposed
COMT+/- mice undergo stressful and injurious events. Our central hypothesis is that COMT+/- mice,
especially females, undergoing transient stressful and injurious events will develop chronic pain at multiple
body sites and increased levels of clinically-relevant cytokine biomarkers that will be reduced by existing FDA-
approved analgesics. Preliminary data show that COMT+/- mice, which exhibit normal baseline pain behavior,
undergoing swim stress and molar extraction surgery develop exaggerated long-lasting pain at multiple body
sites (hindpaw, back, and abdomen). Further, COMT+/- mice undergoing swim stress and molar extraction
exhibit increased nociceptor activity. The studies proposed herein will extend this work. During the 1.5-year
R61 phase, we will establish the magnitude and duration of pain at several body sites, sensitization of primary
afferent nociceptors innervating those body sites, and pain-related depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors in
our COPC mouse model. Upon meeting the ‘go milestones’: COMT+/- vs WT mice undergoing stress+injury
exhibit significant increases (effect size >3) in 1) mechanical pain at multiple body sites and 2) nociceptor
activity, we will move to the R33 phase. During the 1.5-year R33 phase, we will evaluate clinically-relevant
cytokine biomarkers to determine construct validity and clinically-used analgesics to determine predictive
validity of our model. If successful, we will develop a novel mouse model of COPCS with improved validity that
will have a significant impact on effective discovery of analgesics with translational relevance."

This work is proposed in response to NOT-AR-23-006 as a mechanistic study of innate and
adaptive immune responses in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). SLE is a systemic rheumatic
disease that disproportionately impacts females and racially and ethnically disenfranchised
groups. Despite advances in treatment, the molecular mechanisms of SLE pathogenesis remain
poorly understood. Cyclic G/AMP (cGAMP) synthetase (cGAS) is a central driver of the cell-
intrinsic interferon (IFN) response which has been linked to SLE pathogenesis. When activated
by cytosolic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), cGAS generates cGAMP, a key second messenger
for downstream IFN signaling. Resting cGAS is a monomer, and dsDNA-dependent activation
entails dimerization and subsequent higher-order oligomer formation, resulting in the generation
of phase-separated cGAS. In preliminary studies, we have identified the presence of
autoantibodies targeting cGAS in SLE patient sera, which are associated with SLE disease
activity. In addition, we have observed that cGAS can bind to and forms condensates on various
nucleic acids, but dsDNA is the only ligand that permits the dimerization required for enzymatic
activity and formation of hyrdo-gel-like condensates. Building upon these novel observations, we
propose to test the hypothesis that biophysical changes triggered by cGAS activation shape the
adaptive immune response that leads to the targeting of cGAS as an autoantigen in a subset of
SLE patients with active disease. In Aim 1, we will test the theory that dsDNA-dependent gel-like
cGAS condensates are preferentially targeted by SLE autoantibodies. To do this, we will develop
assays incorporating purified cGAS (monomer vs dimer) complexed with various nucleic acid
ligands (dsDNA, dsRNA, ssDNA, ssRNA, DNA-RNA hybrid). In Aim 2, we will determine if phase
separation and/or ligand binding alter cGAS uptake and presentation by antigen presenting cells
(APCs). To accomplish this, we will utilize monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) exposed to
the same panel of cGAS-ligand complexes used in Aim 1, and will analyze cGAS uptake and
subsequent moDC activation using confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. Then, we will
examine the effect of nucleic acid binding on cGAS peptide presentation in the context of MHC II
using a natural antigen processing assay (NAPA). We anticipate that this work will reveal interplay
between innate and adaptive immune components that drives aberrant immune phenomena
observed in SLE, providing a conceptual and experimental framework that could be readily
applied to the numerous nucleic acid-binding autoantigens featured in SLE."

 Exacerbations of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) lead to roughly 1.5 million ED visits and
700,000 hospitalizations annually. Recovery is slow, and accompanied by high levels of acute care utilization
and mortality. Pulmonary Rehabilitation (PR) is a structured program of exercise and self-management support
that has been shown to relieve dyspnea and improve quality of life. Clinical guidelines recommend PR for
patients with stable COPD and after an exacerbation. Unfortunately, even when referred by physicians, our
research has shown that few patients who might benefit from PR ever begin treatment. The primary goal of this
project is to identify effective strategies for promoting and sustaining participation in PR.
 Peer Support involves pairing a patient with a trained peer from a similar background, and facing similar
health challenges, who has completed PR. There is a growing body of evidence demonstrating the feasibility,
acceptability, and effectiveness of telephonic peer support for chronic disease management. Narrative
interventions, or `Storytelling', are novel approaches for changing attitudes and behaviors of patients that
involve creating and disseminating videos narrated by individuals with lived experience with the same condition
or facing the same treatment. Storytelling interventions have been shown to help patients achieve better blood
pressure control, and storytelling is being studied in a variety of other clinical contexts.
 In the R61 Phase, we will recruit and train a cohort of peer coaches in behavior change techniques, and will
recruit a diverse group of storytellers, capture their narratives on video, and create a library of 6-8 powerful
stories. We will finalize our protocol, trial infrastructure, and pilot our recruitment strategy. During the R33
Phase, we will recruit 305 adults treated for exacerbation of COPD, and randomize them to 1) Enhanced
“Usual Care” (eUC); 2) eUC + Storytelling; or 3) eUC + Peer Support. We will evaluate the effectiveness of
each strategy compared to eUC, and to each other, at promoting participation in PR at 6 months. Using a
mixed-methods approach, we will evaluate intervention acceptability, sustainability, and cost, from the
perspectives of the patients and peer coaches as well as PR program staff and hospital leadership. We will use
these findings to refine the strategies and to disseminate an implementation package that will enable other PR
programs to adopt these approaches.
 This project engages key stakeholders in study conceptualization, execution, and dissemination, and is
responsive to the NHLBI/CDC COPD National Action Plan that calls for the development of strategies to
increase the number of Americans that benefit from PR."

 Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons degenerate after functional decline in glaucoma, a
circumstance potentially caused, but certainly exacerbated by, energy deficit, indicating
that metabolic dysfunction contributes to glaucomatous degeneration. High intraocular
pressure (IOP) in glaucoma results in hypoxia that promotes glycolysis through
upregulation of glycolysis-associated genes, but also mitochondrial recycling, and
downregulation of genes encoding for oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). A critical
question is whether RGC metabolic reprogramming from OxPhos to glycolysis is
initiated by IOP-associated hypoxia, and whether repeated reprogramming and
development of pseudohypoxia underlies the energy stress and dysfunction observed in
the glaucomatous retina.
 The long-term goal of this work is to leverage our understanding of retinal metabolism
to maintain visual function despite the stressors inherent in glaucomatous
neurodegeneration. The overall objective of this proposal is to determine the impact of
IOP-mediated damage on retinal and optic nerve head metabolic resilience. Our central
hypothesis is that ocular hypertension (OHT)-associated hypoxia transitions into
pseudohypoxia, destabilizing neural and glial metabolism and mitochondrial
homeostasis, with downstream negative impact on RGCs in the retina and ONH. This
hypothesis derives from our recent analysis indicating that mitochondria and availability
of energy substrates, both targets of hypoxia-associated regulation, contribute to the
metabolic challenges of RGCs. The rationale for the work is that investigating metabolic
cooperation and dysfunction in glaucomatous retina will identify new therapeutic targets
for a disease that has no mechanism-based interventions.
 Guided by strong preliminary data, the aims of this proposal will address a critical
element of the retinal energy management in glaucoma by revealing 1) whether OHT is
the impetus for metabolic reprogramming, followed by adaptation as pseudohypoxia, in
the glaucomatous retina; 2) how metabolic coupling is managed among neurons and
glia in the normal and ocular hypertensive retina; 3) how RGCs, Müller glia, and ONH
astrocytes respond to and manage metabolic challenge on a cell-by-cell basis. Overall,
this work will enable us to determine how RGCs, Müller glia, and ONH astrocytes
respond metabolically to IOP increase, whether those changes persist long-term, and
how we might promote metabolic resilience. The approach is innovative by taking the
position that insight will only come from investigating the metabolic dependencies of the
primary cell types impacted during the development of glaucoma pathology. In addition,
we will apply new cutting-edge approaches to the investigation of mitochondria such as
cell-specific mitochondrial isolation followed by metabolomics and co-detection of
protein and gene expression through spatial transcriptomics. This proposal is significant
because we will reveal mitochondrial-specific metabolic dysregulation amenable to
therapeutic intervention."

children aged 1 to 14 years. For more than 4 decades, we have pursued this mission with the support of a Cancer
Center Support Grant from the National Cancer Institute (NCI). We remain the only NCI-designated Cancer
Center that is dedicated solely to the research and treatment of pediatric malignancies. As such, we serve as a
national and international resource for health care providers, children with cancer, and their families. Through
the support of the American Lebanese and Syrian Associated Charities (ALSAC), a separate organization whose
sole purpose is to raise money in support of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH), we receive robust
institutional support. A total of 75% percent of institutional space and annual budget are invested in the SJCCC.
We propose 5 multidisciplinary research Programs that are organized with the specific intent of translating basic
science discoveries into curative therapies for children with cancer, while minimizing long-term side effects: our
Cancer Biology Program (CBP), which embeds basic cancer research within the heart of the SJCCC, facilitating
direct interaction with the disease-oriented Programs and the major laboratory resources in the Center; our 3
disease-oriented Programs, focused on innovative translational and clinical research in Developmental Biology
and Solid Tumors (DBSTP), Hematological Malignancies (HMP), and Neurobiology and Brain Tumors (NBTP);
and our Cancer Control and Survivorship Program (CCSP), which strives to translate discoveries into effective
strategies to avert or mitigate treatment-related complications and improve the quality of life for survivors of
pediatric cancer. Research by our 114 members is supported by 9 Shared Resources, 1 developing Shared
Resource, and an extraordinary clinical research infrastructure. During the previous funding period, a new
Director was recruited and a new 8-goal strategic plan was launched for the SJCCC. A total of 32,522 clinical
trial enrollments occurred at the Center during the current funding period, of which 60% were to SJCCC
investigator-initiated studies. External peer-reviewed trials, many which are SJCCC member-led, accounted for
another 38% of enrollments. In the last 12 months we were supported by $34.3 million (direct cost) in extramural
funding ($30.3.5 million peer-reviewed; $3.9 million non–peer-reviewed). Since the prior renewal, SJCCC
members published more than 2,100 manuscripts, which includes a marked increase in publications in the
highest-level journals. Our campus has grown in size by 23% and SJCRH and ALSAC have committed to more
than $150 million in new investment to support the SJCCC strategic plan. Despite strategically reducing our
membership by 27% to more tightly focus on cancer research and our strategic plan, NCI funding has increased
by 9.3%, other NIH funding by 9.5%, and our other peer-reviewed funding has increased by 34%."
11036963,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Chronic heavy alcohol consumption contributes to high rates of low trauma fractures in middle-aged
and elderly populations, especially men. However, low trauma fracture rates in chronic alcohol abusers
exceed levels predicted by age, sex, and bone mineral density, suggesting that alcohol negatively
impacts bone quality. Without understanding the precise effects of alcohol on bone quality, it will be
difficult to appropriately target interventions.
 Rhesus macaques are a valuable animal model for alcohol studies because of their similar
physiology to humans and because they exhibit drinking behavior that mimics the full range observed in
humans. We have shown that male rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) offered free access to alcohol
for 12 months had lower cancellous bone turnover in lumbar vertebra, where a negative turnover balance
led to bone loss. The alcohol consuming monkeys also had lower initiation of intracortical bone
remodeling (tibia), a process critical for repair of fatigue-induced microdamage. These findings suggest
that excessive alcohol consumption could lower cancellous bone mass due to a negative turnover
balance and decrease bone quality in cortical bone by suppressing repair of microdamage. These
intriguing effects of alcohol in monkeys require verification by comparison to humans.
 The objective of this R03 application is to assess bone response (quantity and quality) to alcohol in
male and female rhesus macaques at a skeletal site (iliac crest) typically biopsied in humans. We
propose to test the hypothesis that chronic alcohol consumption will result in dose, bone compartment
(cancellous versus cortical), and sex-specific changes in bone architecture and remodeling balance, and
that the changes will be similar to those in humans. Specifically, alcohol will reduce cancellous bone
mass and lower cortical porosity in both species. The rationale for this project is that the results will
increase understanding of the actions of alcohol on the skeleton and will rigorously assess translatability
of the nonhuman primate model to humans. To accomplish our objective, we propose two Specific Aims.
 Specific Aim 1: Assess bone mass, density, microarchitecture, and turnover in iliac crest biopsies
from male and female rhesus macaques given free access to alcohol for 7 or 15 months.
 Specific Aim 2: Assess bone mass, density, and microarchitecture in iliac crest biopsies obtained
from sudden death human males and females who chronically abused alcohol for the previous 5 years.
 The proposed studies are important because 1) they will rigorously test our hypothesis that chronic
heavy alcohol consumption alters bone architecture and turnover balance independent of comorbidities,
and 2) validate the translatability of the animal model to humans. Additionally, the results have the
potential to guide treatment to prevent or reverse the detrimental skeletal effects of alcohol abuse.

computational modeling, with training and mentored research experience towards an independent research
career studying disrupted learning processes in anxiety disorders. Training activities will focus on: 1) clinically
informative applications of computational modeling and neuroimaging in anxiety, 2) advanced computational
modeling of uncertainty and exploration, and 3) ecological momentary assessment of behavioral avoidance.
This training will be facilitated by an interdisciplinary team of experts in computational and neural approaches
to understanding psychiatric disorders, neurally-informed computational modeling of uncertainty and
avoidance, and ecological assessment of clinically-relevant behaviors. Training will take place at the
Department of Psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh, which has a long and successful track record of
supporting junior scientists. To fulfill these training goals, the proposed research adapts approaches from basic
neurocomputational studies on uncertainty and exploration to apply to anxiety. Specifically, the proposed
research will test the hypotheses that anxiety, particularly anxious arousal, is related to disrupted learning
about uncertain, aversive outcomes, as measured by neural and behavioral measures; that disrupted
uncertainty learning leads to avoidance of uncertain options in anxiety; and that measures of uncertainty
avoidance relate to real-world behavioral avoidance. Participants (n=85), oversampled for high anxiety, will
complete a task assessing uncertainty learning while undergoing fMRI scanning. They will then report on real-
world avoidance behaviors for two weeks. Participants’ performance on the uncertainty learning task will be fit
to a computational model to measure learning from uncertainty as well as the tendency to explore versus avoid
options based on uncertainty. Measures of uncertainty estimated from the computational model will be
regressed against fMRI BOLD signals and behavioral choices; these effects on neural and behavioral function
will be tested for differences with anxious arousal. Individual variation in uncertainty-dependent exploration will
be tested for concordance with participants’ current real-world reports of behavioral avoidance and if they
predict future real-world behavioral avoidance. The anticipated impact, in line with NIMH’s Strategic Objectives,
will be identification of a) neural mechanisms for a complex behavior, maladaptive behavioral avoidance, b)
objective assessments of anxiety and avoidance, and c) possible novel treatment targets."
11042416,"ABSTRACT
Background
Survival rates for children with solid tumors, including brain, have largely plateaued over the past three decades
making them the most common cause of disease-related mortality in this age group. After decades of optimizing
chemotherapy and radiotherapy protocols, higher cure rates for childhood solid tumors will no longer be achieved
by “more of the same.” Rather, cures will require innovative interventions that specifically target the unique
biology of these tumors, which are often driven by oncogenic fusions and other pediatric-specific oncoproteins
historically considered difficult drug targets. With advances in targeted protein degradation and chemical
interventions to inhibit protein-protein interactions, it has recently become tractable to target these proteins
previously thought to be “undruggable”. Moreover, unbiased functional screening approaches, such as CRISPR-
Cas9, have revealed new pediatric cancer synthetic lethal liabilities in need of targeted inhibitors.
Aims
We aim to lead the transformation of delivering such specific treatments to our young patients harnessing the
power of a highly interdisciplinary and collaborative team of world-leading experts in pediatric oncology, targeted
protein degradation, high-throughput chemical screening, medicinal chemistry, structural biology, tumor biology,
preclinical drug testing, and clinical trials, complemented by a trans-Atlantic group of engaged patient
representatives.
Methods
A bold plan will be pursued with a portfolio of projects that balance very high-risk efforts with others nearing
clinical implementation. We will focus on drivers/targets in the following diseases: Ewing sarcoma,
neuroblastoma, synovial sarcoma, ependymoma and high-grade glioma. We will explore different approaches
to target these as yet undrugged paediatric drivers/dependencies, to overcome resistance to available targeted
inhibitors, and to improve the efficacy and therapeutic window of CAR-T treatments.
How the results will be used
The aspiration of our team is to establish a sustainable platform for repeated developmental cycles of paediatric-
specific drug development for emerging targets including a viable financial model to de-risk such developments
for such rare pediatric tumors to the direct benefit of our patients. Specifically, we anticipate success through (i)
delivering at least one optimised protein degrader for its application in early-phase clinical trials, (ii) enabling the
druggability of previously “undruggable” targets, (iii) providing mechanistic insights into disease, novel targets,
and therapy resistance mechanisms and ways to tackle them."
11035580,"PROJECT SUMMARY.
Immunotherapy has become an emerging standard-of-care (SOC) for many different cancer types. However,
only 15-20% of patients receive durable benefit. Other limitations include the toxicity of systemically-delivered
immunomodulators which may require frequent, high doses and lead to immune-related adverse events (irAEs).
The risk of severe, and potentially fatal, irAEs increases as the field moves towards immune/immune and
immune/SOC combination therapies. As the “front line” of tumor/immune interaction, the tumor immune
microenvironment (TIME) is a critical locus of immunomodulation, where the kinds of immunocytes in the TIME
predict the likelihood of response to diverse immunotherapies. One strategy to favorably modulate the TIME
following standard-of-care surgical resection, is to localize and sustain immunotherapy at the resection site and
tumor-draining lymph nodes, reversing the immunosuppressive post-surgical wound healing immune
microenvironment while promoting anti-tumor effector cell immunity. This in situ therapeutic cancer vaccination
approach can enhance local concentration of potent therapies while minimizing systemic exposure and likelihood
and severity of irAEs. The use of synthetically engineered microbes as platforms for cancer immunotherapy
provides the potential to intelligently direct and modulate immune cells in situ. Our biomaterial-encapsulated
engineered bacteria are at the forefront of this field, with the ability to carry out targeted localization of engineered
non-pathogenic E. coli releasing TIME-modulating therapeutic molecules. This allows for reduced off-target
toxicity, dose-sparing, and targeting of multiple immune pathways to address the heterogeneous nature of
cancers. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that our living in situ vaccination platform EcN-IL12Vax can
achieve localized and controlled delivery of immunostimulatory cytokines, targeting the post-tumor resection
immune microenvironment and tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) to produce robust anti-tumor responses
that eliminate both local tumor recurrence and lymph node metastases. Importantly, we hypothesize that our use
of bacteria will stimulate the innate immune system while their IL-12 secretion will stimulate the adaptive immune
system, thereby leading to enhanced residual tumor killing. We will characterize the immune response and
efficacy of EcN-IL12Vax in two Specific Aims: Aim 1 will develop potent and programmable non-pathogenic E.
coli as part of a biomaterial-encapsulated engineered bacterial in situ vaccination platform capable of secreting
the immunostimulatory cytokine IL-12. Aim 2 will examine how the duration of IL-12 secretion from EcN-IL12Vax
affects both the efficacy and durability of the immunologic response within the immunosuppressive tumor
resection cavity immune microenvironment and tumor-draining lymph nodes. This transformative approach will
provide the field with an invaluable in situ cancer vaccine platform that can be modified and leveraged for other
solid cancers in future studies and could enable further exploration of additional cytokines and therapeutics with
substantial toxicity at narrow concentration windows where they are both safe and effective."
11036052,"Project Summary: Fusobacterium nucleatum is a significant oral pathobiont associated with
periodontal diseases. When it spreads beyond the oral cavity, it is strongly linked to various
conditions, including colorectal cancer, adverse pregnancy outcomes, inflammatory bowel
disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. The current approaches to combat fusobacterial pathogenesis
have primarily involved antibiotic treatments, such as metronidazole. However, while these broad-
spectrum antibiotics are effective against F. nucleatum, they also disrupt the microbial balance,
leading to dysbiosis and further health complications. This underscores the need for more
targeted, narrow-spectrum antimicrobials that specifically inhibit or eradicate F. nucleatum. To
develop such targeted antibiotics, knowledge of the essential genes encoding core proteins
uniquely required for fusobacterial survival is needed. Our preliminary data show that fomA,
encoding the well-studied fusobacterial major outer membrane porin protein, is essential for cell
viability. This unexpected result challenges the previous report of its non-essential nature. Given
the colocalization of fomA with lysine degradation pathway-associated operons and the
substantial butyrate production by F. nucleatum via the lysine degradation pathway, we
hypothesized that FomA is an integral porin responsible for transporting butyrate, a by-product of
lysine degradation, from the periplasm to the cell's exterior. This proposal seeks to answer why
fomA is essential for cell survival and to systematically identify the essential genes in F. nucleatum,
with the long-term goal of developing targeted narrow-spectrum antibiotics against F. nucleatum.
Aim 1 will investigate the molecular basis of FomA's essentiality in F. nucleatum with a
comprehensive approach that includes a liposome swelling assay and a planar lipid biolayer
assay. Aim 2 will systematically identify the essential genes in F. nucleatum by high-density Tn5-
based transposon mutagenesis followed by high-throughput sequencing and create a CRISPRi
mutant library for each identified essential gene or operon. This experiment will define the nature
of fomA in F. nucleatum, along with a comprehensive understanding of its essentiome. Our
findings will pave the way for new, targeted, narrow-spectrum antibiotics to treat F. nucleatum
infections effectively."

11039141,"This project will credential two novel types of broadly applicable mouse models, which we will demonstrate in
the lung. First, we will express genes that drive disease susceptibility on one side of the lungs only, a model we
call a Unilateral Mosaic, creating disease-prone and disease resistant (internal control) lung tissue in a single
animal. The lungs serve as a proof-of-concept organ, but this Unilateral Mosaic model applies to other
asymmetric or paired organ systems such as the liver, and also to the limbs. The second type of engineered
mouse will harbor an allele that installs permanent genetic marks within niche or neighbor cells, for in vivo cellular
contact tracing in mice. Using a secreted and cell-permeant Tat-Cre protein, cells will be targeted for
recombination in vitro using co-culture and media transfer experiments, and in vivo using transplantation of
engineered Tat-Cre expressing cells into loxP-activated fluorescent reporter mice. There is an urgent need for
mouse models that reduce animal to animal variability, and increase the in vivo resolving power for tracking
cellular behavior. The models we present begin to address these challenges, and will appeal to a wide variety of
investigators that employ mice to study complex human diseases. The proposed genetic tools are designed to
address numerous categories of biological problems in living animals, but are not intrinsically confined to a
specific disease state or organ. These studies employ the well-established Cre-LoxP system for targeted in vivo
gene expression, applicable to the numerous floxed alleles in existence. This work will broadly impact the
available applications for tissue- or lineage-specific expression of genes in mice, enabling investigators to track
cells or induce gene expression in neighboring or transacting cells that contact driver cells of a given lineage.
Specific Aim 1. Generate a Unilateral Mosaic model of disease susceptibility.
 a. Test whether human Ace2 excision can restrict SARS-CoV2 infection to one side of the lung.
 b. Determine whether excision of Cox2/Ptgs2 unilaterally in the lungs can compartmentalize metastatic disease
 after intravenous injection of metastatic mouse mammary cancer cells.
Specific Aim 2. Test and deploy a Tat-Cre allele for in vivo lineage contact tracing
We anticipate this project will yield rapid results, as we already have the ASE-Cre Unilateral Mosaic driver mice
in house and have exciting preliminary data to reveal the target organs for its asymmetric expression. We have
performed many SARS-CoV-2 viral challenge studies in human Ace2 knockin/knockout mice with a currently
approved and active animal BSL-3 program in the lab. In addition to our experience in mouse mammary tumor
models and lung developmental and cancer biology in mice, we have established collaborations to ensure the
success of syngeneic mammary tumor transplant studies. For Aim 2, we already have cloned and present
preliminary data to demonstrate the utility of the new Tat-Cre construct. In summary, we have the required
experience and existing preliminary data and materials to bring the proposed studies to a successful completion."
11043505,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Cancer immunotherapy is based on the premise of immune-recognition and targeted
killing of tumor cells, thus possesses the promising power to eradicate aggressive disease. Notably to date,
immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors significantly prolongs the survival of patients. Unfortunately,
recurrent and metastatic disease occurs to a significant portion of patients within 5 years largely due to
resistance to the immune checkpoint inhibitor. This largely stems from the local immunosuppressive tumor
microenvironment (TME), which is enriched with immunosuppressive myeloid cells. To reprogram the TME into
a “hot” environment enriched with functional myeloid cells, we designed a dual action immunostimulatory
nanoparticle (dual-NP) that triggers a highly potent activation of the dysfunctional tumor-resident myeloid cells.
The premise of our strategy is based on three key components: (1) Our previous studies showed that V domain
Immunoglobulin Suppressor of T cell Activation (VISTA) is a novel myeloid cell-intrinsic immune checkpoint
protein, which controls antitumor immunity. We showed VISTA is highly expressed on immunosuppressive
myeloid cells and blocking VISTA can synergize with TLR9 agonist to reprogram the immunosuppressive
myeloid cells to boost antitumor immunity. (2) The dual-NP is co-loaded with a VISTA siRNA and the TLR9
agonist CpG. Upon intratumoral administration, the dual-NP ensures the simultaneous uptake of its synergistic
cargoes by the same tumor-resident myeloid cells and proficient intracellular delivery of each cargo, thus
achieving optimal effects to activate these cells. Our recent studies show that simultaneous silencing of the
VISTA gene and stimulation of TLR9 leads to a synergistic T cell-mediated tumor clearance and curative
responses with protective immunological memory against tumor recurrence. (3) We developed a simple and
controllable method to generate ionizable lipid dual-NPs of different sizes (i.e., 30, 40 or 60 nm) with high
degree of uniformity and consistency. Our studies show that small dual-NPs achieve widespread distribution
and predominant uptake by myeloid cells throughout the tumor volume upon intratumoral administration.
Innovation: To our knowledge, this is the first effort to combine advanced nanoparticle design, simultaneous
delivery of siRNA and a TLR agonist, and silencing of a gene related to an immune checkpoint protein specific
to myeloid cells.
AIM 1: Optimize the design of the dual-NP and test the ex vivo and in vivo efficacy in reprograming
tumorassociated myeloid cells.
AIM 2: Evaluate the short and long-term safety profile of the dual-NP and characterize the mechanism of
antitumor immune responses associated with dosage and frequency of dual-NP administration.
AIM 3: Evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of the dual-NP as a monotherapy and in combination with standard
immune checkpoint inhibitors in murine models of advanced melanoma and metastatic breast cancer."
11043507,"ABSTRACT
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is particularly resistant to therapy and typically presents as
metastatic disease. Characterized by hypoxia, dense stroma, and metabolic rewiring, original approaches and
combination strategies are desperately needed. We propose to investigate inhibition of a redox signaling protein
and drug combinations that selectively kill the tumor by impinging on critical pathways the tumor is using to
survive. Redox factor-1 (Ref-1) regulates the activity of various transcription factors that drive pancreatic cancer
cell proliferation and drug resistance as well as genes involved in cellular metabolism. Under hypoxia, inhibition
of Ref-1 significantly perturbed metabolic pathways (TCA cycle and OXPHOS) and HIF-regulated genes, and
thus slowed the growth of pancreatic cancer co-culture spheroids and xenografts. The first-generation Ref-1
inhibitor (APX3330) completed phase I trial and demonstrated 32% response, predicted PK, and target
engagement with no significant toxicities. There was disease stabilization in six patients with four on treatment
for an extended time (>250 days). Based on encouraging phase I data and a detailed structural-activity
relationship (SAR) program, we have also identified next generation Ref-1 inhibitors that are at lead optimization
stage, a strategy to screen for patients that have sensitivity to Ref-1 inhibition, and molecular targets that are
likely to synergize with Ref-1 inhibition. However, adaptive mechanisms of resistance eventually emerge with
targeted therapy, therefore we will also focus on the development of novel combinations. Our hypothesis is that
targeting the redox function of Ref-1 alone and in mechanistically designed combination therapies will induce
metabolic lethality and inhibit pancreatic cancer growth and metastasis. In Aim 1, identification of metabolic
characteristics of cancer cells/tissues that associate with the outcome of Ref-1 inhibition and prediction of new
metabolic targets to improve the efficacy of Ref-1 inhibition. Our recently developed computational predictor of
cell-wise metabolic flux will be used to study the metabolic changes due to Ref-1 inhibition in PDAC cells at the
single cell level. In Aim 2, NMR to establish direct interactions of Ref-1 and the new analogues, efficacy, toxicity,
and metabolic stability studies will allow us to advance the top lead candidate(s) for in vivo studies for Candidate
Selection (NIH Milestone 4) and IND (Investigational New Drug) submission leading to eventual Phase I trial.
Lastly in Aim 3, evaluation of Ref-1 in preclinical combination therapy will be used to overcome adaptive
resistance. To further predict metabolic nodes that could be perturbed to synergize with Ref-1 inhibition, creating
a metabolic lethality, computational predictor of cell-wise metabolic flux described in Aim1 will be used. The
efficacy of Ref-1 alone and in new combinations will be investigated using organoids in vitro and the mouse trial
design in vivo. In summary, for a precision approach to kill PDAC, we will deliver a potent and selective Ref-1
inhibitor and combine novel metabolic bioinformatics and drug combinations for enhanced efficacy to have a
significant impact on the field and clinical therapeutics."
11043511,"SUMMARY. Kinase inhibitors targeting the catalytic subunit of the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNAPKcs)
are being developed to sensitize tumors to clastogenic (chromosomal-breaking) agents, such as radiotherapy.
The DNAPKcs kinase inhibitor M3814 (EMD Serono) is in clinical trials, and other new potent inhibitors have
been reported. Elucidating the role of DNAPKcs in the repair of chromosomal breaks is significant because it will
enable the identification of the contexts (e.g. tumor genetic background and treatment regimens) in which
DNAPKcs kinase inhibitors are most effective, and thereby develop biomarkers to predict tumor response.
DNAPKcs has long been recognized as important for promoting radioresistance, but its role in chromosomal
break repair has remained elusive. Namely, DNAPKcs associates with factors in the canonical non-homologous
end joining (C-NHEJ) pathway for DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair but is not required for all C-NHEJ
events (e.g. is largely dispensable for V(D)J recombination signal EJ). Furthermore, until recently, specific
assays to detect C-NHEJ of chromosomal DSBs, apart from V(D)J recombination, have not been available, due
to partial redundancy with the alternative EJ (ALT-EJ) pathway. To address this gap in technology, our laboratory
recently identified a specific hallmark of C-NHEJ. Namely, we reported that several C-NHEJ factors (i.e. XLF,
KU70, and XRCC4) are required for EJ between blunt-ended DSBs (induced by the Cas9 nuclease) that are
joined without causing insertion/deletion mutations (indels), i.e. for accurate/No Indel EJ. In preliminary data, we
show that DNAPKcs is partially required for No Indel EJ, but its role is substantially magnified in cells with XLF
reduced-function mutations (hypomorphs), including mutations in an XLF motif important for binding the KU
heterodimer and DNA. Building on these findings, we will define the role of DNAPKcs in chromosomal EJ and
clastogen resistance. In Aim 1, we hypothesize that XLF and DNAPKcs function synergistically to ensure No
Indel EJ, and this synergy is critical for clastogen resistance. We will also examine the interplay between these
two factors in DNA replication, and define the key domains of XLF and DNAPKcs important for each of these
functions. In Aim 2, we investigate the interplay between DNAPKcs and a set of KU-binding factors, as well as
ALT-EJ, on clastogen resistance and genome stability. We test whether DNAPKcs functions synergistically not
only with XLF, but also with each of four KU-binding factors (CYREN/MRI, PAXX, APLF, and WRN), for No Indel
EJ, clastogen resistance, and robust recruitment of KU to DNA damage. These studies will fill a major gap in our
understanding of C-NHEJ mechanisms. Finally, we posit that combined disruption of DNAPKcs and ALT-EJ
causes aberrant DSB end processing, leading to large deletions, and/or persistent, unrepaired DSBs, thereby
causing reduced clonogenic survival and/or clastogen sensitization. In summary, we will test the overall
hypothesis that DNAPKcs promotes accurate EJ (i.e. No Indel EJ), that its role in such EJ is magnified by defects
in a set of KU-binding factors, and that it is critical for genome stability in cells deficient in ALT-EJ."
11045466,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The past decade has witnessed exponential surges in social media use among U.S. adolescents. Meanwhile,
as mental health problems increase for all ages, the adverse trend is particularly striking among adolescents.
Despite vigorous discussion about the contribution of social media to worsening mental health in adolescents,
little objective data exist about how adolescents use social media and how it affects mental health. Few studies
have examined strategies adopted by adolescents to regulate and manage their social media use; few have
used detailed and objective measures of social media use and content exposure; and almost no longitudinal
studies exist incorporating the strategies, social media use, and mental health. To fill these critical gaps, we
propose a 2-year longitudinal mixed-method study with a national sample of 400 adolescents aged 13-17
years. Phase 1 will collect preliminary data from 100 adolescents to establish measure feasibility and optimize
research procedures (Aim 1a). In Phase 2, a full-scale longitudinal data collection will be completed with 300
adolescents. Phase 1 will focus on one 14-day-long epoch where we will (1) collect daily diary reports of social
media management strategies (SMMS; targeted at access, duration, timing, risky content, and risky social
relations) and the social sources and approaches/tools for SMMS implementation, (2) administer baseline and
end-of-epoch surveys on mental health, and (3) conduct semi-structured interviews among a subsample.
During Phase 1, we will also use our existing pilot data of 154 adolescents to establish algorithms for
processing data from Phase 2 (Aim 1b). Phase 2 will involve a baseline survey and 8 14-day epochs (2 years
X4 quarterly epochs/year). During each epoch, in addition to the SMMS daily diary reports and end-of-epoch
mental health survey, we will also use the Screenomics approach to continuously capture screenshots of
adolescents' phone screens every 5 seconds to measure multiple granular objective indicators of social media
use. Screenomics was IRB-approved, implemented, and proven secure and feasible in our pilot study. Annual
semi-structured interviews will also be conducted among a Phase 2 subsample. The Phase 2 design will
enable the examination of daily reciprocities between the multiple SMMS domains and social media use
indicators (Aim 2), and the bidirectional dynamics associating SMMS, social media use, and their reciprocities
with mental health (Aim 3). This highly innovative project will provide urgently needed information regarding
how adolescents manage their social media use on a daily basis, which strategies influence actual social
media use, and how the strategies and social media use captured through objective data influence and are
influenced by mental health. Findings will offer informative solutions for healthier and safer use of social media
to educators, practitioners, parents, policy makers, technology companies, and adolescents themselves. This
work will also directly inform interventions aimed at maximizing the benefits and minimizing the harms of social
media on adolescents' mental health with effective strategies that are well received by adolescents."

PI: Matthew Brichacek; Co-I: William Gramlich, University of Maine
Abstract/Summary
Glycans in the form of glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and glycolipids provide structural support, mediate
intrinsic interactions, and facilitate extrinsic recognition allowing glycans play an integral role in cellular
pathways and disease states. Interactions of the glycans with glycan binding proteins enable these important
and diverse biological functions. However, the multivalent nature of glycan-protein interactions, as well as the
dependence on distance and orientation, have prevented the Glycoscience community from realizing the full
therapeutic potential of glycans. The proposed, customizable glycan-modified material will enable the
identification and characterization of glycans relevant to human health and explore their effects in a controlled
and customizable extracellular environment.
The first component of the customizable 3D matrix is a suite of thiol-functionalized glycans. Homogeneous glycan
substrates can be tagged with a thiol functionality using reductive amination at the reducing-end of commercially
available glycans or those obtained after fractionation of natural samples. Heterogeneous glycan pools can be
similarly prepared after oxidative or enzymatic cleavage of saccharides from biological samples. The thiol-
functionalized glycans produced offer distinct advantages over existing probes in the efficiency and
spatiotemporal control of the conjugation techniques available. These thiol-modified glycans are first validated
using a microarray of the thiol-functionalized glycans attached to a glass surface. Glycan microarrays are a
sensitive and high-throughput tool to evaluate protein-glycan binding by screening glycan binding proteins,
antibodies, whole cells, or viruses. Previous microarray investigations have identified and quantified glycan-
protein interactions using direct or indirect detection of fluorescence. However, the proposed research plan
utilizes a customizable hydrogel matrix that enables the glycan-protein interaction to be meticulously
characterized: 1) three-dimensional environment effects 2) concentration dependent behavior; and 3) synergistic
or antagonistic interactions with other glycans.
The proposed diagnostic material system is a new tool to better understand the roles that glycans play in human
physiology and disease. The identification and characterization of glycan binding proteins will validate new drug
targets and diagnostic markers in disease states and have a profound effect on human health."
11042452,"Title: Nematicidal chalcones: a genetic approach to uncovering the action mechanism
Project Summary/Abstract:
Parasitic Nematodes (PNs) are enemy to both plant and animals (including humans). These parasites have a
tremendous impact on medicine, veterinary medicine, and agriculture, causing human infections and mortality
(see WHO “Soil-transmitted helminth infections” factsheet) and significant annual monetary losses. For example,
there is an estimated loss of $157 billion worldwide (Li et al., 2007) due to infestation by plant parasitic
nematodes. Therefore, developing new nematicidal agents and understanding their mechanism of action is of
paramount importance; it is likely that a solution to nematode control will come from the use of cocktails of
nematicidal agents, which can control nematodes in different ways. Previous work in our lab identified two
organic chalcones (chalcones 17 and 30) as effective nematicidals on Caenorhabditis elegans and the plant
parasitic nematode Meloidogyne incognita (Saeed, et al. 2012, and Calderón-Urrea, et al., unpublished results).
Furthermore, these chalcones have no significant effects on either soil microorganisms or human cells
(Calderón-Urrea, et al., unpublished results). However, the mechanism of action of these chalcones is not known.
It is possible that these chalcones target essential proteins (enzymes), which are rendered infective by the
chalcones. If this is the case, alterations in the binding of the chalcones to said proteins can be a powerful tool
to elucidate the mechanism of action of the chalcones. We hypothesize that “the susceptibility to chalcones is
due to the action of the chalcone on a protein product, perhaps an enzyme, and therefore mutations on the gene
(or genes) encoding that protein will render the chalcone action ineffective”. We are testing this hypothesis by
conducting a forward genetic screen on mutagenized C. elegans nematodes, and characterizing the isolated
mutants. The specific objectives of this project are: 1) To test resistance to chalcones 17 and 30 and identification
of mutants overcoming chalcone effects; 2) Characterization of chalcone resistant mutants; and 3) Identification
of the DNA sequences involved in the chalcone resistant mutants. The PI will use his extensive experience in
recruiting and training students, particularly from underrepresented groups in sciences, to actively engage them
in the execution of this project."
11040267,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Despite the extensive epidemiologic research conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, there remain gaps in
our knowledge about the epidemiology and transmission of priority respiratory viruses. For example, current
surveillance networks in the United States are primarily limited to people who present for medical care and tend
to enroll readily accessible populations like health care workers. The result is that policy makers have had limited
insight into the epidemiology of respiratory viruses at the community-level, outside of medical settings and in
fully representative populations. There is thus a great need for studies that can obtain data on young adults,
children and pregnant women, as well as from diverse populations and socially vulnerable neighborhoods. This
data would include information on the incidence and clinical burden of respiratory illnesses, attitudes towards
preventive interventions, effectiveness of vaccines and antivirals, and duration of immunity following vaccination.
In addition, changing viral characteristics with emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants has made it challenging to remain
up to date with transmission characteristics, such as duration of infectiousness, attack rates, and determinants
of household transmission. There is arguably even less known about these characteristics for influenza and
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which are also major causes of morbidity. Such data are essential to advise on
both protective public health and clinical guidelines to reduce respiratory virus-associated morbidity and
mortality. To fill these knowledge gaps, we propose to conduct a prospective, longitudinal observational study of
respiratory virus epidemiology in the Greater Boston Area, serving as a Pandemic Preparedness Cohort for the
CDC. There are four components to our project, including an observational study with weekly symptom screening
and symptomatic swabbing, an in-depth serologic sub-study, a case-ascertained household transmission study,
and a data hub/analytic support initiative to coordinate the collective CDC Pandemic Preparedness Cohorts
across the country. The overarching goal of our project is to support the US Health and Human Service Strategic
Plan in safeguarding and improving national and global health conditions and outcomes."
11040273,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Current treatment options for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are inadequate, and many patients living with
ALS seek access to experimental therapies with the hope that they will be effective. Since most patients are
excluded from participation in interventional trials based on restrictive inclusion and exclusion criteria, expanded
access programs (EAPs) can bridge an important gap. As such, through an EAP, we are now proposing to offer
a promising drug – ibudilast – that is presently in a phase 2/3 trial for ALS. Ibudilast has a well-established
favorable safety record and has been approved for asthma and post-stroke symptoms in Japan. Most relevant
to our application is the fact that it is able to penetrate the central nervous system and has beneficial
pharmacological effects for ALS, such as phosphodiesterase inhibition, increased autophagy, and amelioration
of TDP-43 pathology. This EAP will offer ibudilast as an experimental treatment to 200 ALS patients for 6 months.
Our project will develop a network of ALS physicians, to be managed by Mayo Clinic and WideTrial, which
features self-activation and streamlined workflows with e-consent and enrollment, home-health visit ordering,
drug supply ordering, and oversight of safety events and outcomes data capture. Evaluations will be done either
in a physician’s office or virtually in the patient’s home to minimize the burden of participation. Safety monitoring
will be conducted by the treating physician and through blood drawn in the patient’s home, processed in a central
laboratory. We will determine the effect of ibudilast on ALS progression using the gold standard primary clinical
trial outcome measure – the ALS functional rating scale revised (ALSFRS-R) – with the emerging biomarker
neurofilament light (NfL) as co-primary outcome. Given the urgent need for reliable biomarkers, we will also test
other candidates (e.g., TDP-43 markers). Furthermore, to aid in differentiating between ibudilast responders and
non-responders, we will use cutting-edge multi-omic sequencing methods. Our usage of long-read whole-
genome sequencing enables us to span the full range of genomic variation, and by generating complementary
transcriptomic data, we can capture RNA signatures and disease-relevant cell populations. Thus, we strongly
believe that our datasets will provide a valuable resource and can possibly assist in patient stratification. In
summary, our EAP will offer a promising drug, bring together novel web-based infrastructures, implement novel
biomarkers, and obtain multi-omic profiles of responders, thereby allowing tailored personalized therapies and
setting the stage for future ALS clinical trials."
11042286,"ABSTRACT
The goal of this Bioengineering Research Grant (BRG) proposal is to develop fluorescent labels for single-cell
classification through imaging of intact three-dimensional tissue. We are focusing on semiconductor quantum
dots (QDs), nanocrystals that exhibit bright fluorescence and unique optical and electronic properties. We
designed new classes of QDs which we propose will allow quantitative, multispectral analysis of 30 or more
distinct molecules so that hyperspectral light sheet microscopy can be used to proteomically profile and
comprehensively map 20 or more distinct cell types throughout an intact tissue after a single staining step. This
technology addresses an outstanding bottleneck in optical microscopy of three-dimensional tissue, for which
only 3 distinct molecular markers can be easily distinguished, limiting the capacity to precisely classify cell types
and to co-localize different cell types. This proposal comes at a time when new light sheet microscopes have
recently become widely available for full-thickness imaging of optically cleared tissues at sub-cellular resolution
such that rapid advances in multiplexing could yield rapid impacts. As an example, the investigators of this project
developed workflows to optically clear, immunolabel, and image intact adipose tissues from lean and obese
rodent models, in addition to software to comprehensively identify cells based on fluorescent immunostains, and
deep learning algorithms to automate microenvironment segmentation. With these advances, we were able to
discover new classes of immune microenvironments in adipose tissue that are believed to promote comorbidities
of obesity, such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease. However key hypotheses regarding the nature of these
microenvironments cannot be readily addressed until we can discretely categorize cells based on their molecular
expression patterns within their contextual microenvironments. In this proposal, our technological goal is to
develop fluorophores for high-content multiplexing in intact tissues. Our biological goal is to use these tools to
understand immune cell microenvironments that regulate adipose tissue in the state of obesity. Our Specific
Aims are to (1) engineer the photophysics of new classes of QD-based labels, (2) conjugate these labels to
antibody fragments and validate their target specificity as molecular probes, (3) quantitatively evaluate cell
labeling and classification accuracy in three-dimensional adipose tissue, and (4) apply probe panels to quantify
adipose immune microenvironments at the cellular level in the lean and obese states. This is a collaborative
proposal between engineers and scientists with expertise in quantum dots and molecular probes (Andrew Smith),
advanced optical microscopy (Paul Selvin), biomedical image computing (Mark Anastasio), cellular immunology
(Erik Nelson), and animal models of obesity (Kelly Swanson)."
11043157,"Abstract: The effect of a novel fish oil supplement enriched in very-long-chain (C≥24)
polyunsaturated fatty acids (VLCPUFAs) on cardiometabolic risk factors and visual function will
be assessed in this bench-to-bedside proposal. VLCPUFAs play important tissue specific roles
that cannot be fulfilled by more abundant shorter-chain FAs. The ELOVL2 enzyme in the liver is
responsible for converting docosapentaenoic acid (DPA: 22:5 n-3) to tetracosapentaenoic acid
(TPA: 24:5 n-3), which is further extended in 2-carbon steps to chain lengths greater than 36
carbons by the ELOVL4 enzyme in the retina, brain and testis. Heterozygous ELOVL4 mutations
lead to Stargardt-like macular dystrophy, a progressive form of macular degeneration that causes
blindness in young adults. Some ELOVL4 mutations lead to spinocerebellar ataxia. VLCPUFAs
are also important in spermatogenesis and have been proposed to be involved in male infertility.
 Fish oil-derived PUFAs (EPA: 20:5 n-3, DHA: 22:6 n-3) exert potent anti-inflammatory and
cardiometabolic benefits, but in clinical trials like AREDS2 they have not consistently slowed the
progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Standard fish oils, however, contain less
than 1% (w:w) VLCPUFAs. Retinal levels of VLCPUFAs decrease with age and are especially low
in AMD patients. Because ELOVL2 expression markedly decreases with aging due to promoter
methylation, we hypothesized that the age-related declined in VLCPUFAs could be ameliorated
with a dietary supplement containing TPA. We recently showed in aged mice that dietary
supplementation with a novel fish oil enriched in VLCPUFAs (C24-C28) not only improved retinal
function, but also had beneficial effects on cardiometabolic risk factors (decreased plasma lipids
and improved insulin-sensitivity). Some of these beneficial effects are possibly due to the ability
of VLCPUFAs to act as PPAR-agonists. We found that TPA was a more potent PPAR (α and γ)
agonist than EPA and DHA. Our results, therefore, suggest that VLCPUFA-rich fish oil could be
more effective than EPA, a currently approved treatment for cardiovascular disease prevention
and could also be a new nutritional therapy for AMD.
 For our basic science aims, we plan to examine in more detail the mechanism of action
of VLCPUFAs. EPA/DHA are known to exert their anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing effects
by G-protein-coupled receptors (GPRs). Drs. Danner and Wang, NHLBI and CC associate
investigators, will identify possible GPR targets for chemically synthesized VLCPUFA and
elucidate their signaling pathways, using specific GPR knockdown and knockout cells expressing
reporter genes. Dr. Bernstein, an extramural co-investigator, will compare chemically synthesized
VLCPUFA versus EPA/DHA, as well as VLCPUFA-rich fish oil versus regular EPA/DHA-rich fish
oil, for their ability to slow retinal degeneration in Elovl4 conditional knockout mice. Dr. Remaley’s
lab at NHLBI will perform a similar study in ApoE-KO mice comparing the ability of the various
fatty acid supplements for reducing plasma lipids and atherosclerosis. Glucose and insulin clamp
studies, as well as hepatic and muscle RNAseq analysis, will also be performed. Dr. Fliesler, an
extramural co-investigator, will examine in cell culture systems the impact of VLCPUFA on lipid
oxidation, a key process in the pathogenesis of AMD and cardiovascular disease.
 Our first clinical aim will involve the use of human samples provided by Dr. Chew, a NEI
co-investigator and PI on the AREDS2 study. She will design a small pilot case-control study from
AREDS2 by identifying patients that appeared to show rapid progression vs. those who did not
progress to late AMD, after adjusting for random assignment to treatment with or without fish oil
supplementation, as well as for fish consumption. Plasma from the two cohorts will then by
analyzed by gas chromatography to test the hypothesis that patients who did not progress while
on a standard fish oil or a high dietary intake of fish may have increased hepatic production of
TPA. In our second clinical aim, Dr. Remaley’s lab will determine the bioavailability and tolerability
of VLCPUFA-rich fish oil produced by Epax, a fish oil manufacturer in Norway. They have almost
completed the necessary studies to obtain Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) status for their
supplement and have agreed to supply it to us for our study. A single-dose escalation study in
healthy volunteers (50, 500, 1000, 2000-mg/day) will be performed. Besides measuring plasma
FAs levels, we will also monitor clinical chemistry and hematology tests to confirm the safety of
the supplement and to determine if there are any acute effects on plasma glucose and lipids.
Results from this study will then be used for planning for future long-term intervention type studies
in patients with AMD and cardiovascular disease."
11046333,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The mortality rates for patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) are 15-40%, depending on the treatment.
Moreover, the quality of life for surviving patients remains severely reduced. Limb revascularization focused on
limb rescue is critical to saving lives and life quality. Cell therapy strategies currently under investigation inject a
variety of progenitor cells into ischemic tissue with varying levels of success. However, no one has examined
the ability of angiogenic tip-specific endothelial cells (ECs) to promote revascularization in an ischemic limb. We
hypothesize that angiogenic ECs that contain tip ECs will more robustly revascularize ischemic limbs compared
with nonangiogenic ECs. The proposed studies will use highly expandable pluripotent stem cells as the starting
cell source and derive tip and non-tip cell-containing ECs from human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. We
will then compare the ability of tip ECs versus non-tip ECs to rescue the muscle in a hind-limb ischemic mouse
model. For delivery, we employ spatially nanopatterned collagen biomaterial scaffolds to enhance cell survival
after transplantation into the ischemic limb. Lastly, we will incorporate placental growth factor (PIGF) mRNA
delivery from aligned nanopatterned collagen biomaterials to support the release of PlGF protein for maintaining
the angiogenic phenotype of tip ECs, and/or directing in vivo the differentiation of stalk-to-tip ECs. We expect
these studies to show that angiogenic tip-specific ECs, not only integrate into and support current vasculature in
the ischemic limb, but also initiate the growth of new blood vessels, faster re-establishment of tissue perfusion,
and reproducibly rescue the ischemic limb."

The current proposal is seeking funding to achieve the fundamental goal of systematically identifying
processes that show promise during HHP activation. A broad range of reactions will be investigated by
theoretical calculations to identify processes that are stimulated by HHP. Then the selected reactions will
be studied experimentally confirm the results, and determined the extent of the pressure effect. Our own
preliminary data indicate that even a serendipitous search of reactions can yield positive results, however
the lack of systematic framework greatly inhibits progress. What makes the identification of such reaction
networks especially worthwhile is the fact that HHP equipments capable of industrial scale syntheses are
already available and commonly used in the food industry. Thus, any reaction identified in our project
could be scaled-up to industrial scale in a short time. We intend to achieve these goals in two major
steps: (1) Scanning a broad range of reactions by theoretical calculations based on the determination of
the V‡ and V values. The first aim will focus on building a reaction network by selecting a broad range
of transformations based on a literature search and carrying out the theoretical calculations to determine
the favorability rating of those reactions, and identify reactions that are being enhanced under high
pressure conditions. The second aim focuses on the experimental testing of the selected reactions as
classified by the in-silico methods to confirm that HHP in fact improves these reactions. The combination
of the data obtained in Aims 1-2, will aid us to make a more reasonable predictions regarding future
applications of HHP. Finally in aim 3 we extend the application of the HHP-based protocol to currently
known active pharmaceutical ingredients, such as pain killers (paracetamol, or Aspirin),
benzodiazepines, pyrazoles, and hydrazones to illustrate the potential usefulness of the high pressure
synthesis to the pharmaceutical industry."
11047183,"Project Summary. Clinical scientists from the University of Mississippi Medical Center and Mississippi State
University in collaboration with Mississippi Center for Clinical and Translational Research and Mississippi Center
of Excellence in Telehealth are leading this “team science” project that seeks to validate immersive virtual reality
(VR)-based tools to enhance neurocognitive and neuromotor control assessment and treatment techniques. In
the future, these types of tools will enhance provision of specialty care through telehealth, increasing access to
care for the rural poor. Neurocognitive and neuromotor management, including assessment and rehabilitative
treatments, are critical components of care for patients with neurological conditions and impairments. Wearable
technology, integrated with telehealth, can enhance the objectivity of tests, and make treatments more
accessible. The overall project has three separate co-projects, each with its own co-project leads, but provides
a collaborative effort from all team members with the goal of combining neuromotor and neurocognitive
assessments through novel approaches in wearable technology. Co-project #1 will attempt to validate immersive
VR delivered neuro-cognitive tests with clinical test correlates through the use of functional near-infrared
spectrometry to measure hemodynamic response in the large hemispheric regions of the brain in young healthy
individuals. This project will also explore subject performance variability on the tests and compare differences
between real-world and virtual environment test delivery. Co-project #2 will attempt to assess the efficacy of a
custom-made immersive VR fall prevention neuromotor training program that provides virtual, visual postural
perturbations compared to real-world treadmill-based physical postural perturbations. This will be completed
among both a young healthy (18-40 years) and older adult (>60 years) population, and quantified through
comprehensive biomechanical, neuromuscular, cognitive, and subjective measures. Co-Project #3 will attempt
to test the efficacy of a custom-made wearable smart sock with stretch and pressure sensors capable of
capturing foot and ankle kinematics and kinetics, to assess postural stability during dual-task neurocognitive
examination tests in VR among older adults (>60 years). This proposed team-science project is in direct
alignment with many new and ongoing strategic initiatives in Mississippi around the concept of innovation and
wearable and/or medical device technologies for potential use with telehealth. In the future, these types of tools
will enhance provision of specialty care through telehealth, increasing access to care for the rural poor."
11043200,"ABSTRACT
Increasing access to and uptake of biomedical prevention (PEP/PrEP) is critical to ending the epidemic in the
United States (US) among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with other men (MSM). This is particularly
true for urban, African-American or Black MSM, who are disproportionately affected by HIV and would thus
benefit from more HIV testing, which is now recommended every 3-6 months for key groups and is the gateway
to treatment and prevention. NYC is the metropolitan area in the US with the largest number of newly diagnosed
HIV infections among MSM and 89-94% of all people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in the US reside in urban
areas. Although such urban areas often have robust testing and PEP/PrEP dissemination programs, consistent
testing and PEP/PrEP uptake is unacceptably low among urban-dwelling Black MSM. There is thus a need for
interventions to support both HIV testing and PEP/PrEP uptake by accelerating existing implementation and
dissemination efforts. Most HIV testing and PEP/PrEP uptake interventions focus on individual-level navigation
of system/structural barriers and/or cognitive antecedents (intentions, motivation, skills) to behavior; few focus
on reducing stigma/discrimination-related barriers to testing/PEP/PrEP via self-testing, empowerment, peer
support and community norms. To fill this gap, we propose to test an intervention composed of evidence-based
and novel intervention components, designed by our study team, that operate at multiple levels and can be
integrated into CBO-delivered HIV prevention programming to support HIV testing and PEP/PrEP uptake. We
will estimate additive and interactive effects of the components, that include a single-session, peer-based HIV
self-testing component, a three-session PEP/PrEP navigation enhancement component, and a social and print
anti-intersectional stigma media campaign, using factorial and quasi-experimental designs. The primary
outcomes are HIV testing (while not on PrEP/PEP) and PrEP uptake. Secondary outcomes include consistent
HIV testing (2+ tests at least 3 months apart in 9 months); PEP uptake; PrEP/PEP adherence (self-report/medical
record/urine test). To achieve the study aims, we will enroll 480 PrEP-eligible Black MSM (aged 18-55) living in
Central Brooklyn into the study and randomize them to one of four study arms and follow them over 18 months.
Our study, which represents a collaboration between a community-based organization currently engaged in
PEP/PrEP uptake programming and an academic research team, is designed to identify the added value of
components that operate at different levels and are designed to increase individual-level HIV testing and
biomedical HIV prevention use among a group highly vulnerable to HIV."
11046113,"PROJECT SUMMARY (PARENT GRANT)
The goals of this proposal are to uncover how pre-mRNA splicing and nuclear speckles are controlled by
the kinase TAO2, and to determine why TAO2 is required for successful Influenza virus (IAV) replication.
Recent work has identified the understudied protein kinase TAO2 as a host factor essential for splicing and
speckle localization of the IAV M RNA. A pool of TAO2 localizes to nuclear speckles and its loss, by
chemical inhibition or protein depletion, alters nuclear speckle composition, splicing and export of IAV M
RNA, and therefore impairs IAV replication. Inhibition of TAO2 also disrupts splicing of a subset of host
mRNAs, without altering bulk host mRNA. These data uncover a new cellular activity for TAO2 and identify
inhibition of TAO2 as a potential approach for controlling IAV infection. Preliminary data suggest that TAO2
interacts with several splicing factors and other RNA binding proteins. The work outlined in this proposal
seeks a comprehensive understanding of the nuclear activities of TAO2 in human cells and the functional
consequence of these activities for host and viral RNA expression. Specifically, a three-pronged approach
will be taken to: (1) characterize functional TAO2 interaction partners and substrates of phosphorylation
amongst nuclear proteins and determine if IAV infection alters these interactions or if TAO2 interacts
directly with any IAV-encoded proteins; (2) define the role of TAO2 in maintaining the integrity of nuclear
speckles and (3) characterize the global impact of TAO2 on the human splicing machinery and the
consequence of this function for alternative splicing. These goals will be achieved through a combination
of genetic manipulation of cells, biochemistry, mass spectrometry and microscopy. Importantly, the
conclusions obtained from these studies will have implications for general mechanisms of RNA splicing
and nuclear speckle formation and function and will further inform the understanding of host requirements
and vulnerabilities for influenza infection."
11046932,"SAMBAI: Societal, Ancestry, Molecular and Biological Analyses of Inequalities
Research Abstract
Background
Prostate, breast, and pancreatic cancers all have a disproportionately higher rate of aggressive tumor
grade and early onset in Black patients, with recent spikes of high incidence in West African nations
compared to other African regions. The genetic background correlations implicate predispositions.
Members of our SAMBAI team of investigators have pioneered genomics in cancer disparities research,
and over the past two decades, we have uncovered compelling evidence of distinct immunological
mechanisms associated with genetic ancestry. Our SAMBAI team members have developed methods to
quantify environmental exposures and interrogate the lived experiences of marginalized populations,
including epigenetic responses to racism.
Aims
We will partner with scientists across the US, Africa, and the UK to build an unprecedented resource, the
SAMBAI Biobank and Data Repository for Cancer Equity Research. We will generate a comprehensive,
accurate, and relevant measurement of social, environmental, genetic, and immunological factors to
complete an integrated set of analyses to define the causal vs. modifier relationships of disparate
outcomes in diverse underserved populations. We will establish a sustainable framework for team science
approaches with under-represented partners and establish best practices for coordinating cancer equity
research on a global scale.
Methods
We propose to utilize multiple methods across our different work packages. Social Determinants include
self-reporting surveys and database abstractions. Exposomes utilize mass spectrometry of plasma.
Genomics will utilize three sequencing methods on germline and tumor tissue, including long read,
short/deep, and ultra-low pass whole genome sequencing. Lastly, immunological profiles will be
measured with spatial transcriptomics and circulating multiplex immunoassays. These data require novel
computational frameworks, including cloud-based virtualization and the use of machine learning
technologies to identify novel associations across the strata of social to spatial data elements and across
our diverse geographic and ancestral SAMBAI cohorts.
Utility and Impact
We will improve research capacity in under-resourced environments for large-scale cancer research and
equitable access to data with equitable feasibility to improve treatment and outcomes. We will define
interactions of environmental exposures, social determinants, and genetic ancestry that determine
immunological landscapes of primary tumors and/or circulating immunological profiles in patients of
African descent. Our project will contribute a data repository with 100K features/patient, for 40,000
patients. The impact on this population includes a novel trial design, in collaboration with our patient
advocacy partners, to ensure that the specific genomic and immunological features we uncover become
part of targeted precision oncology theragnostic options."
11046946,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Expanded GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeats in the C9orf72 gene were recently identified as the most
common genetic cause of Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), two
neurodegenerative disorders with clinical, pathological and genetic overlaps. Proposed disease mechanisms
include loss of C9orf72 protein function and gain of toxicity from the bidirectionally transcribed sense or
antisense repeat-containing RNAs, mediated by sequestration of RNA binding proteins into RNA foci or by
production of at least five different aberrant dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins [GA, GP, GR, PR, and PA] from
the intronic sequence through a nonconventional translation mechanism called repeat-associated non-AUG-
dependent (RAN) translation. Several studies demonstrated that gain of toxicity from C9orf72 repeat containing
RNAs plays a central role in disease pathogenesis. It is yet unknown which specific cell types in the central
nervous system is responsible for the disease pathogenesis from gain of toxicity. C9orf72 loss of function
alone is insufficient to cause FTD/ALS in mice, but our preliminary data showed it exacerbates diseases
together with gain of toxicity. C9orf72 plays an important role in the immune cells as C9orf72 null mice develop
splenomegaly and enlarged cervical lymph nodes. However, the function of C9orf72 in microglia and its
contribution to FTD/ALS is not determined. In this proposal, will determine 1) molecular pathways altered by
C9orf72 loss of function in microglia using genome-wide RNA sequencing and whether such changes in
microglia will lead to neuronal toxicity (Aim 1); 2) Whether C9orf72 loss of function in microglia contributes to
FTD/ALS pathogenesis caused by gain of toxicity from the repeat containing RNAs in mice (Aim 2); and 3)
cell-type-specific toxicity from C9orf72 repeat containing RNAs (Aim 3). If successful, the proposed study will
further help us understand the disease mechanisms of C9orf72 repeat expansions in FTD and ALS and
identify potential therapeutic interventions."
11047475,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The gut microbiome aids in the digestion of complex polysaccharides, the absorption of vitamins, and the
conversion of primary bile acids, drugs, and other bioactive compounds into metabolites that can be absorbed
by the host. Thus, the metabolic activity of commensal microbes is closely intertwined with human physiology
and the nutritional impact of our diet. However, there is limited understanding of how variation in the ecology of
our intestinal flora modulates the biological impact of diet on human health and nutrition. Recent work has shown
that differences in the composition of the gut microbiome can help explain person-to-person heterogeneity in
glycemic responses, blood lipid profiles, and weight loss. In this proposal, we present an innovative platform for
personalized metabolic modeling of the gut microbiome using metagenomic and dietary data as constraints. We
propose the integration of tissue-resolved metabolic models of relevant host tissues, including a cell-type-specific
metabolic reconstruction of the gut epithelium, into our existing microbial community model to improve estimates
of metabolic fluxes between the gut microbiota, the diet, and the host. We will call this host-diet-microbiome
metabolic model ‘CyberGut.’ Using existing multi-omic data from a cohort of >3,000 adults, we will constrain and
validate CyberGut with paired measurements of diet, host blood metabolomes, and gut microbiomes. In addition,
we will generate cross-sectional training and validation data consisting of paired blood and fecal metabolomes,
fecal microbiomes, and detailed 3-day dietary recall data from a new cohort of 100 healthy participants. Using
these data, we will refine and test two novel and independent diet-inference algorithms, which leverage stool
metagenomes and stool untargeted metabolomes, respectively. Furthermore, using samples taken from a subset
of this new cohort (N=40), we will perform ex vivo stool culturing experiments, designed to directly quantify
metabolic fluxes and bacterial growth rates in vitro. These fluxomic data will be used to directly test in silico
CyberGut flux predictions in response to a diverse panel of dietary and host metabolite interventions. In addition
to contributing to the refinement and testing of our CyberGut model, the paired diet, microbiome, and
metabolomic data, including replicate fluxomic assays, generated in this proposal will be an invaluable resource
to the precision nutrition and human microbiome research community. In summary, we will build, refine, and test
a novel platform for tracking dietary intake and predicting personalized nutritional responses to diet, which has
the potential to fundamentally alter how we design and test dietary interventions."

Founded in 1977 by John Mendelsohn, the Cancer Center at University of California San Diego (UCSD) has
been continuously funded by the NCI Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG) since 1978 and has held
Comprehensive status since 2001. As the only NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center in San Diego
County, the mission of Moores Cancer Center (MCC) is to reduce the impact of cancer in the region and beyond
by fostering scientific discovery, research training, and interdisciplinary care. Our goal is to create, translate, and
deliver high-impact discoveries and innovations in cancer prevention and care through a deep understanding of
the needs of the catchment area, and prepare the next generation of cancer researchers. Accordingly, MCC’s
aims are to: 1) Elucidate the biology of cancer and catalyze trans-disciplinary team science across the science
spectrum; 2) Develop and test innovative preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic approaches; 3) Conduct cancer
prevention and control research to reduce cancer disparities in vulnerable populations; 4) Provide
underrepresented minorities with access to cutting edge multi-disciplinary care; 5) Provide training and education
across the trainee continuum; and 6) Develop and implement community-based cancer education and outreach
programs. To this end, MCC brings together 232 members from 5 UCSD Schools (Medicine, Engineering,
Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Physical Sciences and Biological Sciences) and 2 consortium partners
(one existing: San Diego State University, and one new: La Jolla Institute). Furthermore, MCC integrates the
resources of UCSD Health Sciences and its affiliated hospitals in the UCSD Health System for a unified approach
to cancer research and clinical care. MCC fulfills its mission through the activities of its 5 Research Programs
(Cancer Biology and Signaling, Structural and Functional Genomics, Solid Tumor Therapeutics, Hematological
Malignancies, and Cancer Control) that are supported by 7 Shared Resources (Flow Cytometry, Microscopy,
Transgenic Mouse, Biostatistics, Genomics and Computational Biology, Biorepository and Tissue Technology,
and Biobehavioral), and infrastructure provided by Community Outreach, Training and Education, Clinical
Protocol and Data Management, and Protocol Review and Monitoring. Under the leadership of Dr. Scott
Lippman, Center Director and Associate Vice- Chancellor for Cancer Research and Care, MCC has seen
tremendous growth. During the project period, MCC members authored 3931 cancer-relevant research articles,
and in 2017 were supported by $128.2 million (DC) in annual cancer-relevant peer-reviewed funding (8%
increase); and the total annualized cancer-relevant research base was $148.5M, an increase of 11% from the
previous project period by lateral comparison. Collaborative peer-reviewed grant funding also increased from
annual total costs of $65.9M in 2013 to $69.9M in 2017 (6% increase). Importantly, 33 of MCC’s scientific
discoveries were translated to the clinic through 41 investigator-initiated clinical trials, a 14-fold increase from
the previous project period."

Thrombosis is the major underlying pathology that causes many cardiovascular diseases including stroke,
ischemic heart disease, and venous thromboembolism (VTE). VTE, which includes both deep vein throm-
bosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism, is the third most common cause of death in the world, to coronary
heart disease and ischemic stroke and is responsible for more than 500,000 deaths in the US each
year. Imaging methods to diagnose VTE include compression ultrasonography, computed tomography
pulmonary angiography (CTPA), or ventilation-perfusion lung scanning. However, each of these imaging
methods are qualitative and do not offer a method to determine the type or age of the thrombus, only
visualize its presence or absence. Treatment for these conditions varies depending on the thrombus type;
therefore, the development of non-invasive diagnostic tools to characterize clot microstructure is critical to
the selection of proper treatment and clinical pathways.
Photoacoustic imaging, which relies on the acoustic response from tissue after the absorption of pulsed
light, is a promising method to both visualize and characterize thrombi. The photoacoustic signal depends
on the optical absorption properties of the imaged tissue which vary across wavelengths of light, but exist-
ing methods rely on either a single optical wavelength or on differences between the clot and surrounding
blood and do not attempt to fully characterize the clot or understand the underlying microstructure. We
hypothesize that there is rich acoustic and optical information present within blood clots that can be ex-
tracted and quantified using photoacoustic imaging. Therefore, driven by a team of primarily undergrad-
uate researchers, we will characterize the unique optical properties of biological chromophores relevant
in thrombus formation (Aim 1) and develop algorithms to quantitatively measure blood clot composition in
photoacoustic imaging (Aim 2).
These studies will establish a foundation for quantitative photoacoustic characterization of thrombosis
and develop quantitative monitoring tools to non-invasively diagnose and track thrombus composition over
time. With these tools, we envision improved, targeted therapies resulting in faster treatment and improved
patient outcomes. Furthermore, this project will have a significant impact on the undergraduate research
landscape at Oakland University, supporting the involvement of at least five undergraduate researchers
over the project’s duration."

 The overarching goal of this project is to use a novel virtual reality (VR) physical and cognitive
intervention aimed at improving brain health and cognition in older adults with mild cognitive impairment
(MCI), a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is the most common cause of cognitive impairment in
older adults and affects 36 million people worldwide. Results from several large pharmacological trials have been
sobering with no effective treatments for halting, slowing, or preventing the disease. Exercise has emerged as
an exciting, lifestyle intervention to help mitigate cognitive loss or delay the onset of dementia. However, to fully
leverage exercise benefits in this at-risk population, training the brain to learn and engage in a cognitively-
stimulating and physically-demanding environment may be key to effective therapies. Controlled cognitively-
challenging environments created in a VR setting provide an adaptable and safe environment for improving
cognitive dysfunction in older adults at risk for AD. While a large body of literature has found that exercise
enhances cognition, very few studies have coupled physical and cognitive activity in a VR environment,
simultaneously. By engaging and challenging spatial memory during moderate-to-vigorous intensity exercise
over time, memories for newly acquired information may be stronger and longer-lasting than either physical or
cognitive activity alone.
 Therefore, in this project, we aim to use an integrated, ecologically valid, and meaningful physical and
cognitive intervention in VR that targets the hippocampus, a key region of interest in older adults at risk for AD.
We will recruit and randomize 150 older adults to participate in the intervention (combined physical and cognitive
VR program), active control (physical cycling only), or passive control (cognitive VR only) group to investigate
changes in cognition, brain function, blood-based biomarkers, and physical health in old adults (55-80 years old)
with early mild cognitive impairment. Results from this study will provide new evidence for the benefits of a novel
combined VR intervention that target physical and cognitive health, simultaneously."

Rates of gestational diabetes (GDM) are rising nationwide, particularly affecting people of color.
Despite similar rates among non-Hispanic White and Black women, Black women have more
than double the risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2DM) after GDM as compared to White
women. This contributes to disproportionately high maternal morbidity and mortality rates in the
US, especially among Black birthing individuals. Digital health interventions show promise in
improving health, healthcare, and patient satisfaction, but tailored interventions for the Black
community are lacking, highlighting the need for inclusivity. This research project expands upon
the foundation laid by the parent award by building the evidence base for digital health
interventions, particularly for Black birthing people with GDM who face markedly elevated risk
for T2DM. This Diversity Supplement proposal for the candidate, Ijeoma Uche, MPH, focuses on
patient-centered digital interventions in diverse populations at high risk for T2DM with the
following Specific Aims. Aim 1. Conduct a comprehensive narrative review of randomized
clinical trials that have tested digital/mHealth interventions for postpartum populations at risk for
T2DM, with a focus on diverse individuals with prior GDM. Aim 2. Conduct a process evaluation
of the parent trial, including participants' engagement in and acceptability of the digital health
intervention and trial procedures. Aim 3. Convene a Research Advisory Group of Black
postpartum participants from the parent trial and clinical and health system stakeholders to
assess perspectives on the digital intervention and trial procedures, with the goal of informing
future research in this area. These activities are integral to the parent grant goals and will
provide the necessary research training, mentoring, and experience to build the candidate’s
research career as a physician-scientist focused on digital interventions for maternal health
equity."
11046396,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT. Adolescence is a sensitive developmental period in which prevalence
rates of depression sharply increase. Our current first-line treatments are often ineffective in achieving clinical
remission in adolescents with depression. Thus, given the poor mental and physical health outcomes
associated with adolescent-onset depression, new interventions are urgently needed for the treatment of this
debilitating condition. Probiotics, dietary supplements consisting of live beneficial bacteria that can improve
dysbiosis of the gut microbiota, are a promising treatment for adolescent depression. While there is no
consensus in the scientific literature supporting which probiotic to administer since current probiotic
formulations consist of various different bacterial strains and species, research suggests that multi-strain
probiotics may be more efficacious than single-strain probiotics in preventing and treating gut dysbiosis.
Therefore, the primary objective is to study adolescents diagnosed with a clinical depressive disorder
undergoing Visbiome®, a multi-strain probiotic, treatment to determine changes in two biological signatures: (1)
the left hippocampus–precuneus (HP) resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) of the brain and (2)
Lactobacillus abundance of the gut microbiome (bacteria and other microorganisms and their genetic materials
that reside in the gastrointestinal tract). The central hypothesis is based on the gut-brain axis, where the gut
microbiome influences the hippocampus and precuneus, and thus depression. Guided by published literature
and strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by studying changes in the left HP RSFC, gut
microbiome, and depressive symptoms in two randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The R61 phase will consist
of 77 depressed adolescents randomized to either Visbiome® 450 billion CFU bacteria twice daily group or
placebo twice daily group. The R33 phase will consist of 77 depressed adolescents randomized to one of
three groups: (1) Visbiome® 450 billion CFU bacteria twice daily, (2) Visbiome® 900 billion CFU bacteria twice
daily, or (3) placebo twice daily group. “Go/No-Go Criterion”: To advance from the R61 to R33 phase, the
probiotic group vs. placebo group must meet the following effect size threshold for either the left HP RSFC or
Lactobacillus: ηp2 ≥ 0.06 (p<0.05). The R33 phase will also collect data to help determine the optimal dose of
probiotics for a subsequent larger efficacy trial. The proposed research is innovative because it will inform the
design of a future efficacy trial that has the potential to change clinical practice or practice guidelines. The
proposed research is significant since it is expected to greatly advance our knowledge and understanding of
the underlying mechanism by which probiotics improve depressive symptoms in adolescents, which will
ultimately inform the treatment and prevention of adolescent depression."

Title: PROTECT – Harnessing PROTEin degradation for Advanced Childhood Tumors
Abstract:
Background
Survival rates for children with solid tumors, including brain, have largely plateaued over the past three
decades making them the most common cause of disease-related mortality in this age group. After
decades of optimizing chemotherapy and radiotherapy protocols, higher cure rates for childhood solid
tumors will no longer be achieved by “more of the same.” Rather, cures will require innovative
interventions that specifically target the unique biology of these tumors, which are often driven by
oncogenic fusions and other pediatric-specific oncoproteins historically considered difficult drug targets.
With advances in targeted protein degradation and chemical interventions to inhibit protein-protein
interactions, it has recently become tractable to target these proteins previously thought to be
“undruggable”. Moreover, unbiased functional screening approaches, such as CRISPR-Cas9, have revealed
new pediatric cancer synthetic lethal liabilities in need of targeted inhibitors.
Aims
We aim to lead the transformation of delivering such specific treatments to our young patients harnessing
the power of a highly interdisciplinary and collaborative team of world-leading experts in pediatric
oncology, targeted protein degradation, high-throughput chemical screening, medicinal chemistry,
structural biology, tumor biology, preclinical drug testing, and clinical trials, complemented by a trans-
Atlantic group of engaged patient representatives.
Methods
A bold plan will be pursued with a portfolio of projects that balance very high-risk efforts with others
nearing clinical implementation. We will focus on drivers/targets in the following diseases: Ewing
sarcoma, neuroblastoma, synovial sarcoma, ependymoma and high-grade glioma. We will explore
different approaches to target these as yet undrugged paediatric drivers/dependencies, to overcome
resistance to available targeted inhibitors, and to improve the efficacy and therapeutic window of CAR-T
treatments.
How the results will be used
The aspiration of our team is to establish a sustainable platform for repeated developmental cycles of
paediatric-specific drug development for emerging targets including a viable financial model to de-risk
such developments for such rare pediatric tumors to the direct benefit of our patients. Specifically, we
anticipate success through (i) delivering at least one optimised protein degrader for its application in
early-phase clinical trials, (ii) enabling the druggability of previously “undruggable” targets, (iii) providing
mechanistic insights into disease, novel targets, and therapy resistance mechanisms and ways to tackle
them."

Understanding how T cell receptors (TCRs) see tumor antigens presented by MHCs is necessary to fully
understand how the immune system recognizes tumor antigens, and to reap the full potential of antigen-specific
immunotherapy. To achieve this goal, a quantum leap forward is required in which the revolutionary advances in
machine learning are combined with a large volume of structure, function, data on matched TCR-pMHC pairs.
The development of accurate predictors of TCR-antigen recognition will be dependent on the creation and
integration sequencing-based datasets with high-throughput structural and functional insights. Our proposal,
submitted as a CRUK/NCI Grand Challenge team (MATCHMAKERS) will combine researchers with expertise in
immunology, methods development, structural biology, and computation to enable generalized prediction and
design of TCR recognition. This work will be spread across four Work Packages (WPs):
WP1: Large-scale generation of TCR-pMHC pairs from naturally occurring sources. We will build datasets of
naturally occurring TCR-pMHC pairs. Our team will use an array of approaches to collect these datasets, from
humans and from mouse models, and in the context of both cancer and immunity more generally.
WP2: Ultra-high throughput TCR-pMHC matching using molecular engineering. Efforts to create general models
will require a broader array of data than feasible to collect from natural TCR systems. We will use an array of
synthetic approaches developed by our team to comprehensively match TCRs with pMHCs to train
computational models.
WP3: Large-scale structural and biochemical analyses of TCR-pMHC interactions. A key to our team’s vision is
to match interaction datasets with high throughput structural and functional insights. A deep understanding of
how the TCR contacts with MHC helices control function and orientation will be essential for training and testing
computational models.
WP4 AI-based prediction and design of TCR-pMHC interactions. We will integrate our data to train next-
generation algorithms capable of generally predicting and designing TCR-pMHC interactions. These predictions
will proceed through a reiterative testing and feedback circuits for further model optimization."
11045394,"This Administrative Supplement targeting complementary and integrative health (CIH)
practitioners seeks support to enhance the research capabilities of Dr. Wren Burton, MPH, DC.
The proposed award targets a critical phase in Dr. Burton’s career trajectory, aiming to facilitate
her transition to an independent clinician-researcher and to be competitive for a future NIH
career development award to advance her independence. Dr. Burton’s research interests focus on
multimodal chiropractic care (MCC) for older adults with chronic pain, aligning with NCCIH
priorities. This award will support Dr. Burton’s time to serve as a study team member for our
NCCIH-funded R34 trial, which will afford her with essential hands-on training in clinical trial
conduct. The parent award evaluates combined MCC and Tai Chi for chronic nonspecific neck
pain (CNNP). Phase I established treatment regimens through a Delphi process, while Phase II
will investigate feasibility and participant experiences while optimizing data collection
processes. Dr. Burton’s participation in this trial offers a unique opportunity to hone her skills in
clinical trial design, IRB protocols, participant recruitment, outcomes assessment, safety
monitoring, and data management, while addressing a topic central to her research interests.
 In addition to primary hands-on learning in the parent award, she will engage in three
related and complementary training activities with her mentorship team. These include 1)
completing data analyses and publishing multiple peer-reviewed articles related to an
observational study of CNNP and gait health (same study population as parent award), 2)
contributing to the design and initial conduct of an adjunct neuroimaging pilot study employing
the same combined MCC and Tai Chi interventions for CNNP as the parent award, and 3)
drafting a competitive K23 application. The proposed activities will substantially extend Dr.
Burton’s hands-on experience in clinical trial conduct, enrich her data management/analysis
skills, strengthen her writing of peer reviewed manuscripts and grants, and introduce her to the
fundamental neuroimaging research. This training will significantly contribute to the
development of Dr. Burton as an independent clinician researcher and further enhance the CIH

 Infection with Chlamydia trachomatis is responsible for significant morbidity and healthcare costs
throughout the world. Work from our lab has demonstrated that T cells are a key mediator of immune
protection against C. trachomatis. Our long-term goal has been to gain an understanding of how CD8+ T cells
are stimulated in response to C. trachomatis infection. The reagents we have developed have allowed us to
use contemporary approaches in cellular immunology to define how Chlamydia-specific T cells respond to
infection. We have shown that transfer of cultured Chlamydia-specific CD8+ T cells into mice can protect
against infection, yet surprisingly, a protective CD8+ T cell memory response is not stimulated following natural
infection of mice or people. The apparent failure of the adaptive immune system to effectively clear the
organism and/or prevent repeat infection is a hallmark of human infection with C. trachomatis, resulting in
sequelae of infection such as permanent reproductive tract damage. Consistent with these findings in humans,
we have observed that CD8+ T cells respond extremely well to primary infection, yet the memory cells that
result from initial infection have impaired recall during subsequent encounters with the organism.
 Here, our goal is to 1) understand the mechanism by which CD8+ T memory is inhibited during infection
and develop methods to overcome it, and 2) identify vaccine formulations that stimulate protective CD8+ T cells
and test their capacity to enhance vaccine-mediated CD4+ T cell immunity. The vaccine strategies we will use
build on a successful experimental approach using nanoparticles encapsulating an adjuvant and bound to
whole inactivated organisms. Ultimately, we anticipate this work will drive selection of appropriate strategies
for vaccine development that provide robust protection against C. trachomatis."

Our vision is to unravel and ultimately reverse the intricate network of causal factors throughout the life course
that disrupts biological homeostasis to promote colorectal cancer (CRC) among individuals younger than age 50
years. Uniting leading scientific minds in early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC) research and complementary
fields, we have embraced disruptive, transdisciplinary approaches spanning cells to individuals to populations to
address the core Grand Challenge to “Determine why the incidence of early-onset cancers is rising globally”. We
will address specific questions of “the mechanisms linking lifetime exposures with cancer initiation and
promotion” by focusing on EOCRC as an ideal model for early-onset cancer due to the availability of well-
characterized animal models and well-established and prevalent precursor lesion, the adenomatous polyp
(adenoma), offering a unique opportunity for interception and prevention. Our work will transform the field by
directly addressing our overarching goal to “identify and understand the processes through which different
biological and environmental factors cause early-onset cancers”, and reverse the burden in a timely, effective,
feasible, inclusive fashion. Our team, both working independently and in collaboration, has uncovered several
risk factors that are likely to be drivers for the rising incidence for EOCRC. We are now uniquely positioned to
translate etiologic understanding to actionable prevention by identifying novel factors, including environmental
and social determinants, and deepening our understanding into overlooked dimensions of exposure throughout
the life course. The unprecedented scope and scale of our proposal can only be supported through Cancer
Grand Challenges since our “high-risk” disruptive approach requires deep interactions between work packages
(WP)s led by leaders in diverse disciplines. This will enable incorporation of fresh perspectives to move beyond
traditional risk-factor epidemiology toward an integrated, mechanistically-informed model with population scale
and cellular resolution of the multiple and cumulative “hits” that promote EOCRC to inform the development of
actionable prevention. Our innovations intersect epidemiology, small molecule discovery, genomics, stem cell
biology, immunology, and computational biology with these key features: 1) harmonization of diverse cohorts
with data and biospecimens collected across the lifecourse; 2) innovative and reliable analysis of small molecules
to detect novel exposures; 3) high-resolution technologies for analysis of target tissues; 4) model systems
capable of interrogating accumulating exposures across the lifespan and their impact on the cellular ecosystem;
5) prevention through risk assessment and pharmacologic/lifestyle interventions. Collectively, our work will serve
as an exemplar for transforming research into other early-onset cancers."

The ultimate purpose of the COBRE in Stroke Recovery is to improve the recovery of those who have suffered
a stroke such that long-term quality of life is improved. Our primary focus is on developing and testing
mechanism-based interventions to rehabilitate individuals with post-acute or chronic impairments and
disabilities. We seek to accomplish this through the following Overall specific aims: 1) Expand our critical mass
of funded investigators; 2) Strengthen innovative scientific cores that advance stroke recovery research; and 3)
Advance the ongoing development of an independent, sustainable, multidisciplinary thematic research program.
Our COBRE has been developing the skills and infrastructure to address the unique healthcare needs of the
state of South Carolina (SC). Specifically, SC is in the “buckle” of the stroke belt, having one of the highest
incidences of stroke and age-adjusted stroke mortality in the nation.1 Further, it has the 14th largest rural
population2 in the nation, and all 46 SC counties qualify in whole or in part as Health Resources & Services
Administration (HRSA)-designated Medically Underserved Communities. Thus, there is an overarching need to
develop tele-interventions to serve rural communities with limited access to stroke rehabilitation care. Our
COBRE has focused on developing innovative tools, methods, and interventions to address the burden of post-
stroke disability. Additionally, through innovative approaches in psychosocial functioning and novel device
development, our team is invested in ensuring that rehabilitation gains that occur in the clinic translate into lasting
gains in an individual’s lived environment. Our interdisciplinary Team Science project brings together engineers,
occupational therapists, neuropsychologists, cognitive psychologists, neuroscientists, and data scientists.
The research question to be addressed by this COBRE Team Science Supplement is “Can an interdisciplinary
team science research approach successfully improve upper extremity (UE) stroke recovery, especially for rural
populations, by translating innovative interventions to the home setting?” Specifically, our interdisciplinary team
science research project comprises three innovative, synergistic co-projects that use tele-interventions for UE
stroke rehabilitation and test three different ways to improve rehabilitation outcomes in the home. 1) The Seo
Co-Project aims to improve the adherence to and performance of home-based UE stroke recovery interventions.
The project will objectively track and measure the quantity and quality of rehabilitation exercise and use a sensor-
based stepped-care behavioral intervention that monitors adherence, administers ecological momentary
assessments to obtain a reason for non-adherence, and provides relevant resources. 2) The Aghamoosa Co-
Project aims to address the multisystem functional deficits that result from stroke and may pose barriers to UE
recovery. The project will address cognitive deficits at the outset of a behavioral activation participation-based
telerehabilitation program to substantially improve stroke survivors’ ability to benefit from the intervention by
facilitating their learning, planning, organization, and goal management skills and ultimately increasing real-world
arm use. 3) The Badran Co-Project aims to use neuromodulation to increase the neuroplasticity underlying UE
recovery. The project will test the feasibility of translating a COBRE junior investigator project-developed
intervention (transcutaneous auricular nerve stimulation, taVNS) to a home tele-intervention. It proposes lab-
based testing of the feasibility of their stimulation-triggering sensors and at-home testing of the safety, feasibility,
and acceptability of self-administered auricular neurostimulation during telerehabilitation of post-stroke UE motor
deficits in the home setting. Our COBRE has been a leader in developing neuromodulation tools for increasing
neuroplasticity in order to improve rehabilitation gains.3-5 However, few innovative tools have been translated
into the home environment. Together, the co-projects synergistically advance UE stroke rehabilitation tele-
interventions and ultimately can be integrated to maximize the effectiveness of UE interventions and improve
the quality of life for rural South Carolina stroke survivors.
The team science approach is crucial for successfully developing an interdisciplinary approach that will allow our
investigators to improve stroke recovery by translating innovative interventions to the home setting and assuring
that they better translate into functional gains in the real world for stroke survivors. Some of the immediate
synergies that would result are the use of the movement quality and quantity tracking capabilities developed in
the Seo Co-Project being applied to future telerehabilitation interventions such as those in the other Co-Projects.
Similarly, the cognitive priming developed by the Aghamoosa Co-Project and the neuroplasticity priming
developed in the Badran Co-Project both can be used to augment future telerehabilitation interventions. Our
vision is to continue to develop innovative tele-interventions that can be integrated or preferentially selected to
maximize the effectiveness of UE interventions through personalization to the deficits of each individual.
In conclusion, our COBRE is uniquely poised to address serious health deficits faced by SC and other IDeA
states through a team science effort to develop novel tele-interventions designed to produce lasting functional
improvements in the home setting – especially those in rural communities and for those without reliable access
to rehabilitation care."
11046893,"PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT
Annually, liver disease accounts for nearly 2 million deaths worldwide. Immune responses in the liver must
balance elimination of local infection with non-reactivity to benign gut-derived dietary and microbial antigens.
Excessive/dysregulated immune activation in the absence of infection promotes liver tissue damage while
insufficient immunity facilitates the development of chronic infection and hepatocellular carcinoma. Thus, there
is an urgent need to pinpoint immunological pathways that can be modified to control hepatic maladies without
compromising liver function. Our proposal will utilize malaria liver stage infection as a model system to identify
factors that dictate the quality of hepatic CD8 T cell responses. Plasmodium malaria parasites initially infect the
liver and replicate as liver stages within hepatocytes to generate exoerythrocytic merozoites that are released to
infect red blood cells. Liver stages are essential to establish infection but are clinically silent and were only
recently shown to induce a significant innate immune response. We previously demonstrated that Plasmodium
infection induced IFN-I signaling weakens anti-Plasmodium adaptive immunity by promoting the development of
dysfunctional hepatic CD8 T cells. This dysfunctional signature bears striking similarity to the T cell exhaustion
program induced by chronic infection and tumors. Yet, how does a transient, non-chronic infection that is limited
to hepatocytes induce such profound T cell dysfunction? We now report that IFN-I signaling solely in hepatocytes
is a major contributor to the induction of hepatic CD8 T cell dysfunction suggesting that hepatocytes are central
immune platforms that determine the quality of adaptive immunity in the liver. From functional assays and gene
expression analyses of hepatocytes enriched from mice infected with rodent malaria parasites or human-liver
chimeric mice infected with Plasmodium falciparum, we show that this IFN-I response is initiated by hepatocyte
expression of the IRF3 transcription factor. Moreover, we establish that concurrent with IFN-I induction, LS
infection profoundly reshapes the hepatocyte transcriptome and metabolome likely inducing an
immunosuppressive microenvironment around the infected hepatocyte, which we predict impairs an ensuing
hepatic T cell response. In Aim 1, we will use cutting-edge single cell multi-omic studies and functional analyses
to identify hallmark features of Plasmodium infection induced CD8 T cell dysfunction to determine whether it is
distinct from bonafide T cell exhaustion. In Aim 2, we will focus on hepatocytes to characterize how parasite-
induced IFN-I signaling remodels intrahepatocyte transcriptomes and metabolomes to impair hepatic CD8 T cell
responses. In Aim 3, we will generate novel transgenic parasites that deliver viral antagonists of IRF3 into the
infected hepatocyte to compromise Plasmodium-induced IFN-I signaling solely within the infected hepatocyte
and improve anti-Plasmodium adaptive immunity. These aims will broaden and deepen our understanding of the
immune responses to a complex eukaryotic pathogen to improve liver-directed anti-malaria vaccines."

This is a proposal for a Diversity Supplement to fund research training and career development for Dorothy
Lartey, a talented undergraduate student and soon postbaccalaureate researcher in the Kong Lab at the
University of Washington. The parent grant for this proposal is 4R00GM132518-03, which focuses on
understanding the mechanisms that modulate a cell’s sensitivity to morphogens. Dorothy’s research involves
understanding the function of MOSMO, a ciliary tetraspan that establishes a cell’s sensitivity to the morphogen
Sonic Hedgehog (SHH). While we know that MOSMO forms a complex with MEGF8 (a single-pass
transmembrane protein) and MGRN1 (an E3 ubiquitin ligase) to regulate Smoothened (SMO, a core
transducer of the Hedgehog signaling pathway), its role in this process remains unresolved. To address this,
Dorothy will specifically examine the MOSMO/MEGF8 interaction and its ciliary localization, assessing both
their roles in regulating Hedgehog signaling activity. Aim 1 focuses on dissecting the MOSMO/MEGF8
interaction, using predictive models to disrupt the interaction and study subsequent effects on the localization
of SMO and Hedgehog signaling. Aim 2 focuses on MOSMO localization, generating constructs that do not
localize to the cilia and utilizing these to understand its role in regulating SMO. Lastly, Aim 3 examines the role
of cholesterol in regulating the activity of MOSMO. These proposed studies will advance our understanding of
how the MOSMO/MEGF8/MGRN1 (MMM) complex works and how target cells regulate their sensitivity to
extracellular cues. Through this project, Dorothy will learn many new technical skills to prepare her for
graduate school, including signaling assays and cell culture protocols. In addition, Dorothy will learn how to
organize her data and present her work as a poster at multiple meetings. Collectively, this supplement will
prepare Dorothy for success in biochemistry research in the form of graduate school and beyond."

Rates of mental and behavioral health disorders are increasing among adolescents coinciding with in-
creases in overall time spent engaging with social media and other online activities. This trend has led to
a strong media narrative that online engagement is spilling over into offline mental and behavioral health.
However, empirical evidence is relatively weak and mixed between positive, negative, and null effects.
Some evidence suggests there may be benefits from online engagement. For instance, youth who iden-
tify as sexual and/or gender minorities (SGM) may benefit from receiving emotional support in desig-
nated online spaces that support SGM identities. Other research finds negative impacts for girls’ mental
health related to online engagement as well as increased exposure to cyberbullying among SGM youth.
There is a strong potential of high impact interventions that consider adolescents embedded within the
online context but this area of research is limited by cross-sectional, self-report methods and an almost
exclusive focus on time spent online and unidirectional associations rather than bidirectional within-per-
son mechanistic processes and rich assessments of online engagement. Passive assessment of online
engagement and mental health indicators can provide ecologically valid data on naturalistic adolescent
online behaviors and experiences, recognizing that adolescents both shape and are shaped by their
online environments. Informed by the Compensatory Internet Use Theory (CIUT), this study leverages
multiple data streams (e.g., survey data, ecological momentary assessment (EMA), passive digital trace
data from smartphones) to test mechanistic within-person processes that underlie bidirectional links be-
tween offline mental and behavioral health and online behaviors and experiences, identifying potentially
modifiable targets for future prevention and intervention development. We will recruit both a clinical and
non-clinical sample of adolescents age 13-15 (n=450) with an overrepresentation of SGM youth to partic-
ipate in the following research activities: (a) three bursts of a 21-day EMA of moods and motivations for
engaging online; (b) three pre-burst and three post-burst surveys of mental and behavioral health and
online experiences; and (c) passive assessment of digital trace data related to online behavior (e.g., so-
cial networking, messaging, music, typed language) and proximal indicators of mental health (e.g., sleep,
activity). To address study aims, natural language processing will be utilized to detect hidden mental
states in language data and dynamic structural equations modeling will be used to estimate between-
person differences in within-person adaptive and maladaptive mechanistic pathways leveraging all data
streams. These results are a necessary next step in understanding how real world, ecologically valid as-
sessments of online engagement longitudinally and acutely impact mental health and wellbeing as well
as identifying modifiable targets to promote youth mental health and well-being in the digital age."

Enzymes are powerful biocatalysts that may be repurposed for efficient and sustainable
synthesis of industrial and pharmaceutical compounds. Identifying novel enzyme-catalyzed
reactions and understanding their catalytic mechanisms is essential for expanding the
biocatalytic toolbox. We have recently discovered a unique copper-containing antibiotic, fluopsin
C, which is produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a leading cause of multidrug-resistant
nosocomial infections. By studying how P. aeruginosa makes fluopsin C, we identified an
unusual biosynthetic pathway that involves novel enzyme chemistry. For instance, two iron-
dependent enzymes of a new heme-oxygenase-like enzyme family catalyze a carbon excision
and an oxidative decarboxylation and N-hydroxylation respectively. Two lyases of the
adenylosuccinate lyase enzyme family exhibit novel activities of making and breaking carbon-
sulfur bonds respectively. The chemistries we identified have expanded the catalytic capabilities
of these enzyme families. We hypothesize that the fluopsin C biosynthetic enzymes use novel
catalytic mechanisms and can be repurposed or engineered to generate new molecules. To test
this hypothesis, we will use a combination of enzyme kinetics, structural biology, spectroscopy,
and synthetic chemistry tools, with a focus on three enzymes in fluopsin C biosynthesis. Studies
of these distinct enzymes will advance the fundamental understanding of how their respective
enzyme family catalyzes diverse chemistry. Defining the mechanisms and substrate scope of
the enzymes will allow them to be further explored for biocatalytic use."

This underscores the significance of interprofessional networking in the career development of CIRM professionals and reflects ACRM's commitment to fostering a culture of diversity and social health justice. Throughout the R13 grant's one-year duration, fellows will provide feedback at three intervals, contributing to a continuous dialogue and improvement process. This feedback, synthesized into manuscripts, will be presented at the 2025 ACRM annual meeting to highlight the workshop's impact on fostering diversity and innovation in CIRM."
11041696,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The continuous discovery of new biological targets presents opportunities to dramatically improve our
understanding of diseases and normal function and provides new avenues for treatment. In vivo imaging of these
targets via positron-emission tomography (PET) is an especially powerful tool to understand the initiation and
progression of disease and to aid in the development of novel therapeutics. The major benefits of PET are the
very high sensitivity (enabling imaging of scarce biological targets without saturating them), and the ability to
image deep tissues (which provides translatability from preclinical research to later clinical use).
But the development of useful and validated tracers can take years or decades. A significant limiting factor is the
complexity and cost of radiochemistry, and the difficulty in using current technologies to optimize synthesis
conditions – a key step toward achieving reliable production with sufficient yield to support initial imaging studies.
Slow throughput and high reagent and isotope consumption mean that optimization studies are very expensive
and time-consuming, and thus such studies tend to be very limited and are unlikely to find globally optimal
conditions. These limitations also create pressures in other aspects of new probe development, e.g., significant
efforts are made to reduce the number of “hits” so only a very small number of compounds are labeled and
studied via in vitro and ex vivo assays and in vivo imaging. However, this selection process is imperfect as it
sometimes leads to the pursuit of dead-ends while it excludes promising candidates.
To more rapidly leverage preclinical and clinical imaging of new biological targets, the radiochemistry field is in
urgent need of new tools to improve the tracer discovery and development process. Our proposed solution is
the development of high-throughput radiochemistry methods. Arrays of droplet reactions have recently been
introduced as a way to rapidly perform dozens of reactions in parallel from a single batch of radioisotope, with
total reagent consumption of those reactions similar to a single batch on a conventional system. Furthermore,
the droplet reactions can readily be scaled to quantities for preclinical or even clinical imaging. These methods
could be used to efficiently explore a vast reaction parameter space in a matter of days (instead of weeks to
months), or they could be used to label dozens of candidate compounds in parallel to perform screening based
on the most relevant metric: in vivo properties. While these reaction arrays, operated using manual pipetting,
have revealed the benefits and potential of high-throughput radiochemistry, this new technology requires
significant further development and automation to increase safety and speed, and reduce the chance for human
error. We propose to (1) integrate in situ radiation detectors to quantify the radioactivity at various stages of each
reaction, (2) integrate a method to automatically sample the reactions for analysis (radio-TLC or radio-UPLC),
and (3) use high-throughput methods to optimize the synthesis of radiotracers that currently have low yield,
develop at least one novel tracer, and develop best practices for high-throughput optimization in radiochemistry."
11043732,"Project Abstract
We aim to investigate which biomarkers are most useful in identifying increased risk for adverse cardiovascular
(CV) and kidney outcomes in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and with
reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). This is imperative because chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common among
patients with heart failure and associated with adverse outcomes. Up to 56% of patients with heart failure suffer
from kidney function decline, subsequently leading to worse CV outcomes, but biomarkers to accurately identify
which patients are at risk for decline in kidney glomerular filtration rate (GFR) are lacking. This not only limits
prognostication, but makes clinical decisions regarding eligibility of patients with HFrEF for advanced therapies
very challenging. Kidney disease can be assessed using GFR, which can be estimated using serum creatinine
(eGFRcr), cystatin C (eGFRcys), or a weighted average of the two (eGFRcr-cys). It is unknown whether eGFRcr,
eGFRcys, or eGFRcr-cys is better at predicting CV outcomes among patients with HFpEF or HFrEF. Additionally,
soluble suppression of tumorogenicity 2 (ST2), and galectin-3 are easily obtainable blood biomarkers that may
be associated with CKD progression and increased mortality, predominantly in patients with HFrEF, but have
not been tested in patients with HFpEF. These biomarkers will be useful in understanding which patients
are at increased risk of GFR decline and adverse CV events. Moreover, identifying such biomarkers will
pave the way for future studies to better understand kidney disease pathogenesis in the setting of heart
failure. To answer these questions, we plan to obtain specimens from the Treatment of Preserved Cardiac
Function Heart Failure With an Aldosterone Antagonist trial (TOPCAT), a study population with HFpEF available
in BioLINCC. Of 3445 participants, 220 have serum samples available at baseline and one year for analysis. We
plan to measure serum cystatin C, ST2, and galectin-3. Our other biomarker of interest, serum creatinine, is
already available in the dataset. We will use these data to: Aim 1a, test the association between baseline and
increasing levels of serum ST2 and galectin-3 with the composite outcome of aborted cardiac arrest, heart failure
hospitalization, or cardiovascular (CV) death; Aim 1b, test the association between baseline and increasing
levels of serum ST2 and galectin-3 and the outcome of change in eGFRcr-cys from baseline to 1 year; Aim 2,
investigate which GFR estimate is more predictive of the composite outcome; and Aim 3, analyze data from the
Registry Evaluation of Vital Information for Ventricular Assist Devices in Ambulatory Life (REVIVAL), which is
also publicly available in BioLINCC and has baseline serum creatinine and cystatin C measurements available,
to evaluate which GFR estimate is the best predictor of all-cause mortality and a composite of heart failure
hospitalization and CV death in patients with HFrEF. The overarching hypotheses are that (1) serum ST2 and
galectin-3 are biomarkers associated with adverse CV and kidney outcomes in HFpEF patients; (2) eGFRcr-cys
is the best GFR estimate to predict adverse outcomes in patients with HFpEF and HFrEF."
11047263,"PROJECT SUMMARY – TEXAS DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER FOR AIDS RESEARCH
In 2019, the US announced a plan to End the HIV Epidemic by 2030. To be successful, strategies that improve
HIV prevention and HIV treatment outcomes are needed. Only 56% of people with HIV (PWH) were virally
suppressed in 2018, a critical determinant of health outcomes and transmission risk, and 51% of HIV
diagnoses in 2018 were in the US South, despite constituting only 38% of the population in the US. Texas is
the second most populous state in the US, behind California, with about 29 million residents, and is in the US
South as defined by CDC and the Census Bureau. Unfortunately, this large Texas population, coupled with
weaker public health and prevention policies and funding across the US South, has a growing HIV population
that lags in critical health outcomes. There is an urgent need for more research and research infrastructure to
combat the HIV epidemic in the US South and specifically in Texas to both contribute to ending the US HIV
epidemic and to learn how to best do that in resource constrained areas of the US. We therefore will establish
a Texas Developmental Center for AIDS Research (D-CFAR) to support the overall mission of the national
CFAR program by facilitating high-priority HIV research and supporting the effort to end the HIV epidemic in
the US. Three institutions have collaborated to propose this D-CFAR: Baylor College of Medicine in Houston,
The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston and the Texas Biomedical Research Institute in
San Antonio. Based upon the outstanding expertise of its investigators, the Texas D-CFAR will focus its
activities in the five-year funding period on the research theme “Ending HIV and Optimizing HIV Health in
Texas.” To accomplish its goals, the Texas D-CFAR will: 1) Provide organizational and financial management
and facilitate activities and programs that strengthen and enrich the D-CFAR research and intellectual
environment; 2) Support targeted high-priority interdisciplinary pilot research projects, assist in responding to
new HIV-related research initiatives, and facilitate research on ending HIV and improving health of PWH in
Texas; and 3) Provide state-of-the-art expertise, advice, and services to facilitate the range of HIV-related
research for D-CFAR investigators. The Texas D-CFAR will support an Administrative Core, a Developmental
Core, a Basic Science Core and a Clinical and Biostatistics Core to meet investigator needs and catalyze
innovative research. The scientific Cores will build on outstanding strengths in virology, non-human primate
resources, clinical trials research and biostatistics. The D-CFAR will engage a Community Advisory Board and
Internal and External Advisory Boards for guidance. Coupled with outstanding institutional support, the D-
CFAR will stimulate new research and collaborations among basic, translational, clinical, health services and
public health researchers. The D-CFAR will significantly advance knowledge needed to end HIV and improve
the health of PWH in Texas and similar areas, train the next generation of scientists, and grow into a full
CFAR, thereby contributing to ending the HIV epidemic in Texas, the US South, and beyond."
11043516,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The bone marrow niche houses hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), cells that self-renew and differentiate into vital
blood components like white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. HSCs are supported by other marrow
resident cells, like vascular endothelial cells and stromal cells, that nourish the marrow with essential signals.
Unfortunately, radiation and/or chemotherapy used to treat cancer patients injure the bone marrow niche.
Damaged bone marrow function places patients at potentially fatal risks from low blood counts. Because blood
cancers are exquisitely sensitive to radiation, targeted radiation delivery via radioimmunotherapy, or target-
specific antibodies stably linked to radioactive isotopes, has been developed to treat hematologic malignancies,
though some have with slow bone marrow recovery. Despite increasing clinical trials evaluating
radioimmunotherapies, how these delivered radionuclides impact the cellular, molecular, and systemic
mechanisms that regulate the bone marrow niche has yet to be identified. The impact of radioimmunotherapy
on the bone marrow niche must be addressed if radioimmunotherapies are to gain traction, and specifics on
these mechanisms can be leveraged to minimize radiation-induced marrow toxicity. Further complicating the
utility of radioimmunotherapy, radionuclides have distinct payload characteristics with unknown consequences
on the bone marrow niche. This proposal will uncover the differential effects of an alpha-emitter (astatine-211)
and a beta-emitter (yttrium-90) compared to non-targeted X-ray radiation to procure essential knowledge to
advance these technologies clinically. We will report how these radiation types differentially regulate the
abundance and function of HSCs, endothelial and stromal cells, essential regulators of hematologic function. We
will also compare how radiation targeting impacts bone marrow components by comparing how
radioimmunotherapy using a broad hematologic marker (CD45) and more restricted surface marker (CD33)
impacts bone marrow components. Experimentally, we will use in vivo competitive transplantation assays in mice
to assess long-term and short-term HSC potential as a function of radioimmunotherapy. These studies will be
coupled with flow cytometry to quantify how radiation type regulates hematopoietic, vascular, and stromal cell
frequency, death, and proliferation. We will leverage cutting-edge confocal imaging with thick femur sections to
understand how radioimmunotherapy differentially regulates the three-dimensional bone marrow architecture,
critical for vascular niche function and hematologic recovery from irradiation. More importantly, differential gene
expression in the HSC, endothelial and stromal cell compartments, as a response to differential radionuclide
delivery, will also be quantified using RNA sequence analyses. The results from these experiments stand to
identify mechanisms responsible for radiation injury in HSCs, and the endothelial and stromal cell response
systems that can be manipulated to derive a desired clinical outcome, and give providers the tools to accelerate
bone marrow recovery, or inhibit residual hematopoiesis as desired in bone marrow stem cell transplantation."
11047272,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Administrative (Admin) Core (Core A) is the coordinating hub of the Emory CFAR with responsibility for
scientific leadership, effective stewardship of resources, investment in innovative HIV research initiatives, and
support for the recruitment of Early-Stage Investigators. This is accomplished through five science cores and
two Scientific Working Groups. Core services are evaluated annually, and resources leveraged to ensure the
evolving needs of HIV researchers are met. The Admin Core continues funding developmental awards and
promoting training programs moving early-stage investigators to independent funding with a focus on women
and underrepresented minorities. We seek a revision to the Admin Core to include the nationally focused
CFAR Adelante Research Capacity Program (CFAR Adelante). The key tenets of CFAR Adelante are team
science, mentorship, and community engagement with a goal to build long-term community-academic
partnerships. Program participants benefit from multi-level and bidirectional mentorship relationships and
scientific mentorship—goals that perfectly align with those of the Emory CFAR. Through the end of this project
period, we propose to 1) provide funding for the currently awarded AMRP Cohort V Teams to complete their
two-year projects; 2) support one additional cohort of up to four Adelante Teams; and 3) recruit another cohort
of up to four Adelante Teams. The Emory CFAR is Co-Directed by three distinguished HIV investigators
providing complementary expertise across all major areas of HIV research at Emory. Dr. Carlos del Rio is
contact PI and Co-Director for Clinical Science, Dr. Colleen Kelley is MPI and Co-Director for
Prevention Science, and Dr. Ann Chahroudi is MPI and Co-Director for Basic Science. The Admin Core
will continue to provide scientific leadership, effective stewardship of resources, and extensive administrative
support to ensure the success of the Emory Adelante and its integration into the following aims:
Aim 1. Provide scientific leadership and coordinate activities that support CFAR Members as they advance
groundbreaking HIV research across the entire scientific spectrum of NIH-defined priority research areas to
end the epidemic for all and to promote health equity.
Aim 2. Allocate resources effectively and judiciously to support six Cores and two Scientific Working Groups,
providing cutting-edge tools and services to elevate multidisciplinary and translational HIV research.
Aim 3. Develop the next generation of outstanding and diverse HIV investigators through innovative
developmental grant programs, leadership development and mentoring, and promotion of inclusion and
diversity in all aspects of the Emory CFAR.
Aim 4. Utilize intentional communication and dissemination strategies to promote multidirectional stakeholder
engagement between HIV researchers and the communities we seek to serve."
11047290,"Summary: Apoptosis is a type of programmed cell death and has for a long time been appreciated to be a
hallmark of cancer cells. In recent years, drugs targeting the apoptotic pathway, such as the FDA-approved
BCL-2 inhibitor, venetoclax, have revolutionized therapy in cancers which have a particular vulnerability to
targeting this pathway. A different programmed cell death pathway, ferroptosis, has recently been discovered.
Understanding which cancers may be vulnerable to the induction of ferroptosis and which targetable molecules
are involved could lead to a new wave of successful cancer therapy. MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma (NB) is
one of the deadliest subtypes of pediatric cancer. Here in, we demonstrate that amplified MYCN drives an
aberrant iron capture program in NB and increases intracellular cysteine biosynthesis and selenocysteine
dependence through multiple mechanisms to detoxify reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation as a result
of high cellular iron. The consequence of these MYCN-directed changes is a synthetic lethality to genetic or
pharmaceutical targeting of the glutathione/glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) pathway resulting in ferroptotic
cell death. This grant aims to expand our understanding of how MYCN alters cysteine and selenocysteine
production and ferroptotic inducing pathways to sustain an antioxidant defense and how these pathways may
be exploited pharmaceutically to improve therapeutic responses in this recalcitrant tumor type.
Specific Aims:
Aim 1: Characterize the ability of MYCN to suppress ferroptosis in neuroblastoma
Aim 2: Identification of synthetic lethal ferroptosis resistance mechanisms in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma
Aim 3: In MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma mouse models, evaluate novel ferroptotic combination therapies
Study Design: Using well isogenic cell lines and patient-derived xenograft cell cultures, we will mobilize
expertise in selenocysteine biosynthesis (Copeland), pantothenate kinase inhibitors (Rock), and genomic
screening of ferroptotic pathway modifiers (Olzmann) to better define the ferroptotic vulnerability in MYCN-
amplified NB and to uncover novel sensitizers to ferroptotic inducers in MYCN-amplified NB. The goal of these
experiments is to not only better understand how the MYCN oncogene hijacks cysteine for selenocysteine
production to mount a defense against an oxidized phenotype, but to create new therapeutics to create better
anti-ferroptotic approaches in MYCN-amplified NB. To this end, we will work with our preclinical mouse model
expert (Koblinski) and a NB clinical investigator (Glod) to build the preclinical evidence of synthetic lethal new
therapies into the clinic for refractory NB patients. Recently, inhibiting telomerase was demonstrated to induce
ferroptosis. We propose to expand our investigations of inhibiting telomerase with clinically-advanced
telomerase inhibitors in combination with canonical ferroptosis inducers, as this presents an intriguingly new –
and clinically advanced—strategy to take advantage of the ferroptosis vulnerability in MYCN-amplified NB."
11047291,"Project Summary/Abstract
We confirm that the scope of the parent grant (R01AI168163) will remain unchanged.
Malaria parasites infect red blood cells (RBCs), within which they proliferate to cause disease in a continuous
cycle of invasion, growth, and egress from one host RBC to another. Free merozoite parasites use ligand-
receptor interactions to invade RBCs and escape the humoral immune system after egress from an infected
RBC. Plasmodium vivax, a parasite that causes malaria, exclusively invades reticulocytes, the youngest RBCs,
through these ligand-receptor interactions. The Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC) is a blood group
antigen on the RBC surface. DARC was the first identified receptor for P. vivax, binding the parasite protein P.
vivax Duffy Binding Protein (PvDBP). Genetic variations in the DARC gene, which determines the presence or
absence of Duffy antigens, affect malaria control efforts. Duffy-negative populations of African ancestry were
initially thought to resist P. vivax invasion. However, recent studies showed that Duffy-negative cells allow a
low level of DARC expression, primarily on immature reticulocytes, the presumed target of invasion by P. vivax
parasites.
There have been increasing reports of antimalarial drug resistance with P. vivax, which poses a significant
public health concern and impedes malaria control efforts and elimination programs. The mechanisms of drug
resistance in P. vivax are poorly understood, and we hypothesize that drug resistance will be influenced by
invasion into reticulocytes of different ages, cells undergoing dynamic changes to surface receptor
presentation, sub-cellular organelle composition, and metabolic capacity. Given the observation regarding
Duffy-negative invasion into immature reticulocytes, I hypothesize that the invasion of parasites into younger
reticulocytes alters sensitivity to standard antimalarial drugs. Here, I propose to (Aim 1) explore whether P.
vivax invasion into reticulocytes of different ages promotes drug resistance (in reticulocytes with and without
DARC); (Aim 2) identify reticulocyte host receptors for P. vivax using a CRISPR/Cas9-based RBC knockout
screen of candidate membrane receptors. This work is crucial for advancing 1) our knowledge of P. vivax
invasion in Duffy-negative reticulocyte populations and drug resistance mechanisms and 2) identifying novel
reticulocyte-tropic invasion pathways."
11042487,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The COVID-19 pandemic created the greatest infectious threat to global health in 100 years,
and monumental efforts have been made by the scientific community to combat the SARS-CoV-
2 virus. This proposal seeks to extend this effort by investigating a mechanism by which SARS-
CoV-2 hijacks the host cell chaperone system to replicate itself. We have evidence that the
SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase (RdRp) co-opts the cytosolic chaperonin containing TCP-1
(CCT, also called TRiC) to assemble the active polymerase complex. CCT is a large (1 MDa)
protein-folding machine that plays a major role in the cellular chaperone network responsible for
maintaining the proteome in good working condition. It uses ATP hydrolysis-driven
conformational changes to assist cytosolic proteins with multiple domains, complex folding
trajectories, or obligate binding partners to achieve their native state and assemble into
complexes. In addition to folding cellular proteins, CCT has been shown to bind several viral
proteins and contribute to viral replication of HIV, hepatitis C, influenza A, rabies, Zika and
reovirus. These observations show that CCT is a common host chaperone used by diverse
viruses to fold viral proteins, assemble viral complexes, and support viral replication. Based on
these findings, we initiated an investigation of the role of CCT in SARS-CoV-2 replication. Here,
we present robust preliminary evidence indicating that the SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein
12 (Nsp12), the catalytic subunit of the RNA polymerase, is folded by CCT and that CCT
contributes to RdRp complex formation and SARS-CoV-2 replication. In Aim 1, we propose to
thoroughly test this hypothesis using multiple experimental approaches. In Aim 2, we propose to
determine high-resolution structures of the complex between Nsp12 and CCT. We have isolated
an Nsp12 folding intermediate bound to CCT and have determined preliminary structures of the
complex by cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Further cryo-EM analysis will yield a high-
resolution structure of the Nsp12-CCT complex, which will be invaluable in guiding the design of
therapeutics to block Nsp12 folding by CCT, inhibit formation of the RdRp complex, and disrupt
viral replication."
11047094,"SAMBAI: Societal, Ancestry, Molecular and Biological Analyses of Inequalities
Research Abstract
Background
Prostate, breast, and pancreatic cancers all have a disproportionately higher rate of aggressive tumor grade and
early onset in Black patients, with recent spikes of high incidence in West African nations compared to other
African regions. The genetic background correlations implicate predispositions. Members of our SAMBAI team
of investigators have pioneered genomics in cancer disparities research, and over the past two decades, we
have uncovered compelling evidence of distinct immunological mechanisms associated with genetic ancestry.
Our SAMBAI team members have developed methods to quantify environmental exposures and interrogate the
lived experiences of marginalized populations, including epigenetic responses to racism.
Aims
We will partner with scientists across the US, Africa, and the UK to build an unprecedented resource, the SAMBAI
Biobank and Data Repository for Cancer Equity Research. We will generate a comprehensive, accurate, and
relevant measurement of social, environmental, genetic, and immunological factors to complete an integrated
set of analyses to define the causal vs. modifier relationships of disparate outcomes in diverse underserved
populations. We will establish a sustainable framework for team science approaches with under-represented
partners and establish best practices for coordinating cancer equity research on a global scale.
Methods
We propose to utilize multiple methods across our different work packages. Social Determinants include self-
reporting surveys and database abstractions. Exposomes utilize mass spectrometry of plasma. Genomics will
utilize three sequencing methods on germline and tumor tissue, including long read, short/deep, and ultra-low
pass whole genome sequencing. Lastly, immunological profiles will be measured with spatial transcriptomics
and circulating multiplex immunoassays. These data require novel computational frameworks, including cloud-
based virtualization and the use of machine learning technologies to identify novel associations across the strata
of social to spatial data elements and across our diverse geographic and ancestral SAMBAI cohorts.
Utility and Impact
We will improve research capacity in under-resourced environments for large-scale cancer research and
equitable access to data with equitable feasibility to improve treatment and outcomes. We will define interactions
of environmental exposures, social determinants, and genetic ancestry that determine immunological
landscapes of primary tumors and/or circulating immunological profiles in patients of African descent. Our project
will contribute a data repository with 100K features/patient, for 40,000 patients. The impact on this population
includes a novel trial design, in collaboration with our patient advocacy partners, to ensure that the specific
genomic and immunological features we uncover become part of targeted precision oncology theragnostic
options."

This is a competing revision for the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) CFAR to permit continued support for our
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Pathway Initiative (CDEIPI) program, originally funded as a CFAR supplement.
The program leverages the strengths of the JHU CFAR and is in line with the overall CFAR goals with a
specific focus on providing mentoring, support, and pilot funding for the next generation of HIV/AIDS
researchers, and to increase the pipeline of new investigators from groups underrepresented in medicine and
health. This application will primarily support the Generation Tomorrow: Summer Health Disparity Scholars
(GT:SHDS) program which began in 2019 as an expansion of Generation Tomorrow (established in 2013).
The GT:SHDS was initially launched as a 10-week summer program for undergraduate students from across
the United States interested in HIV and/or HCV health disparities and their intersection with substance use
(addiction and overdose), violence, mental health, and the social determinants of health. With CDEIPI FY21-23
funds, the program expanded to include a graduate student training track. The program offers mentorship and
training in HIV/HCV education, testing, and counseling; health disparities, cultural competence, and harm
reduction. The participants also engage in community outreach with community partner, Sisters Together and
Reaching, Inc. The program has a special focus on students that are underrepresented in nursing, public
health, medicine, and science with an emphasis on first generation college students and individuals from
minoritized/disadvantaged backgrounds. The purpose of this proposal is to sustain/grow GT:SHDS, therefore,
our specific aims are: Aim 1. To increase the volume in our pathway to assist individuals from disadvantaged
backgrounds in gaining exposure to mentorship and research in health careers/science professions with a
focus on HIV and HCV health disparities. Aim 2. To enhance cultural competence and humility by promoting
respect for the patient, their values/beliefs, and lived experiences. Aim 3. To promote comprehensive care of
individuals impacted by HIV and HCV infections with a recognition of the importance of the intersection with
substance use (addiction and overdose), violence, mental health, and the social determinants of health. Aim:
4.To support the professional identify formation (PIF) of developing healthcare professionals from diverse
backgrounds. In sum, the GT:SHDS program will support the CFAR goals to help to support a more diverse
and culturally competent HIV medical and scientific workforce which will in turn serve to reduce critical health
disparities with respect to HIV prevention and treatment outcomes."

Investigator R01 is to develop novel, targeted prevention approaches for recurrent CSA, a new research
direction for the PI (Kobulsky). The objectives are to illuminate the etiology of recurrent CSA and to
conceptualize prevention models within child welfare systems.To accomplish this, we propose a mixed

existing partnerships among Temple University researchers,
, and administrators in the
CSA
prevention, data science, geographic spatial analysis, qualitative and mixed methods, and health equity,
positions us to create and analyze a unique linked longitudinal dataset, and to conceptualize prevention that
will integrate research findings and the perspectives of multiple system constituents.
 Aim 1 is to curate a comprehensive longitudinal dataset from 2013-2021 including both CPS and law
enforcement-investigated cases of CSA. We will leverage state-of-the-art data science techniques to create the
dataset through the linkage of the PCA and DHS administrative data (Aim 1a). Natural language processing
will be applied to extract data elements from free text fields, (Aim 1b) and geocoding to link neighborhood-level
information. This unique dataset allows us to conduct a rigorous study of CSA and gain new insights into the
prevalence and contributing risk and protective factors to CSA over time.
 Aim 2 is to illuminate the multilevel etiology of recurrent CSA. The aim will apply shared frailty survival
analyses and spatial survival analysis to the dataset created in Aim 1 in order to identify the most potent
predictors of recurrent CSA over time. It will examine the influences of CSA characteristics (Aim 2a), and social
determinants of health (SDH) at the family (Aim 2b) and neighborhood (Aim 2c) levels on CSA recurrence.
 Aim 3 is to conceptualize prevention models for recurrent CSA. Qualitative interviews with multidisciplinary
workers from the Philadelphia child welfare system, non-offending caregivers, and survivors will elicit
interpretation of Aim 1 and 2 findings to enrich our theoretical model and conceptualize novel recurrent CSA
prevention.
 Using a cutting-edge, mixed-method design, this project will illuminate the etiology of recurrent CSA and
present significant new avenues for CSA prevention embedded within child welfare systems. This grant is an
essential first step in a R34 NIH planning grant to develop novel, targeted CSA prevention, a new research
agenda for the PI that can advance life course health and development for survivors of CSA."
11047824,"ABSTRACT OVERALL
The main goal of our IPCAVD Program grant is to evaluate in humans self-amplifying mRNA
(saRNA) vaccines that express two HIV-1 Env-derived protein immunogens that activate and
initiate the maturation of VRC01-class B cell receptors (BCRs). The first immunogen,
426c.Mod.Core, was specifically designed to bind with high affinity to the unmutated (germline,
gl) forms of those BCRs as they are expressed on the surface of naïve B cells. The second
immunogen, HxB2.WT.Core, although unable to bind germline VRC01-class BCRs, binds the
VRC01-class BCRs that became activated by 426c.Mod.Core and have accumulated some
somatic mutations. As a result, the boost immunization with HxB2.WT.Core furthers the
maturation of the VRC01-class antibodies elicited by the 426c.Mod.Core. These observations
were made with the adjuvanted recombinant (rec) forms of these two immunogens. As mRNA-
based vaccines are less costly and more easily GMP-manufactured that rec proteins, we
believe that they will accelerate the preclinical and clinical evaluation of HIV-1 Env-derived
immunogens. Here, we propose to first compare preclinically the VRC01 B cell and antibody
responses elicited by these two Env immunogens when delivered by saRNA vaccines to those
elicited by the corresponding adjuvanted rec proteins. And then, if the results are promising, the
saRNA vaccines expressing the two immunogens will be GMP-manufactured for clinical
evaluation. As the 426c.Mod.Core adjuvanted rec protein will be evaluated clinically (phase I) in
the spring of 2022 (HVTN301) and the HxB2.WT.Core rec protein is currently being GMP
manufactured for a follow-up phase I clinical evaluation in 2023, we will be in a unique position
to compare the VRC01 B cell and antibody responses elicited by humans immunized with these
two HIV-1 Env-derived immunogens when delivered as adjuvanted rec proteins and as
expressed by saRNA vaccines. To accomplish our goals in this IPCAVD grant we will take
advantage of our expertise in immunogen-design and testing, expertise in the analysis of B cell
and antibody responses elicited by vaccination and during infection, our ability to rapidly
sequence BCR genes using high through put technologies, the availability of appropriate animal
models, our expertise in saRNA vaccine technology, our unique expertise in conducting clinical
testing of HIV-1 vaccines, the existing collaboration among the participating groups and the
documented expertise of the participants to successfully manage complex Programs."
11046201,"Our laboratory will interrogate and/or block function in biological systems with functionalized polymers based on
recent developments from our laboratory that provide insights into how to control binding and activation of
receptors, and into control of ruthenium-catalyzed metathesis copolymerizations. First, cholera is still a life-
threatening illness with an annual incidence of ~2.9 million cases and ~95,000 deaths annually in endemic
countries. Many outbreaks of cholera would be staunched by a therapeutic that reduced cell binding and thus
spreading of V. cholerae, the etiologic agent. Our laboratory and collaborators demonstrated that cholera toxin
B pentamer (CTB) and a norbornyl polymer randomly displaying galactose and fucose self-assemble into cross-
linked CTBn–glycopolymer networks. Larger aggregates result in better inhibition of cholera intoxication.
Synthesis of different fucose/galactose polymer systems, analysis of the dependence of aggregation capture
and kinetics on polymer structure, in combination with toxicity testing will be undertaken to develop simple, oral
therapeutics for cholera disease. Second, about 12% of American males between the ages of 15-44 are infertile
or subfertile, and failure of sperm to undergo acrosomal exocytosis (AE) is responsible for a significant fraction.
Better molecular diagnostics are required to diagnose subfertility. We demonstrated that human and mouse
sperm acrosomal exocytosis (AE) are activated with glycopolymers, although highly cooperative inhibition of AE
is observed at higher concentrations of the dose-response curve. Polymers with different backbones, sugar
densities, and sugars will be utilized to reduce cooperativity in the inhibition arm and to analyze which are best
for activation of human AE. The most effective probes will be used to identify the human AE sperm receptor.
Third, copolymers with well-controlled microstructure display superior morphology and enhanced properties,
such as spatial organization, folding and self-assembly. We demonstrated that precisely alternating AB
copolymers can be prepared from bicyclo[4.2.0]oct-6-ene-7-carboxamides (A) and large unstrained
cycloalkenes (B) with Grubbs III catalyst through alternating ring-opening metathesis polymerization. The A
monomer substituent and the microsequence of the polymer define surface behavior and solution structure
morphologies. Mechanistic structure-activity studies with A monomer varying C7 substituents (ketone, ester,
methenyl) will be undertaken to understand the source of alternating selectivity with an expanded B monomer
repertoire. These SAR studies will allow further exploitation of AROMP for gradient copolymer synthesis to tune
material properties and functions in one-pot polymerization reactions. The underlying chemical synthetic
methodologies proposed for these three discrete projects are highly related through polymer synthesis. We
anticipate synergy and support between project researchers will provide further opportunities for innovation that
cross between projects."
11046220,"The dramatic underrepresentation of Non-English speakers (NES) in clinical trials contributes to health
inequities and compromises the generalizability of research. Barriers to enrollment include factors associated
with patients (mistrust, competing demands, and challenges with follow-up), researchers (extra time and cost
required for translation, enrollment, communication, and regulatory burdens), and system-related factors
(inconsistent IRB interpretations of federal regulations, and interpreter availability and willingness to document
consent). Our recent research regarding local barriers is consistent with prior publications; the system-related
factors identified included staff familiarity with federal regulations, availability of interpreters, willingness of
interpreters to sign as witnesses, time for consent discussions, and translating short- and long-form consent
documents. Although an increasing number of publications have reported these barriers, few have proposed
solutions. Thus, identifying and testing solutions is a key focus area for research. This study uses a modified
Delphi method to reach consensus on best practice to overcome system and regulatory barriers. Stakeholders
involved in the Delphi process include Institutional Review Board (IRB) members, research compliance staff,
principal investigators, research coordinators, interpreters and community representatives from a local
organization serving immigrants and refugees. We will test the resulting process in the Hannaford Center for
Safety, Innovation & Simulation at MaineHealth for two different types of clinical trials: a trial with first-person
patient consent and a trial requiring consent from a legally authorized representative given the patient’s
incapacity at the time of initial enrollment. Simulated consent encounters will include principal investigators,
research staff, interpreters and standardized patients. Simulation participants, community members, IRB
members and compliance staff will evaluate the process through review of recorded simulations and debrief
meetings. The consent process will be varied in subsequent simulations in response to stakeholder
evaluations. A central premise of this study is that it is possible both to achieve the aim of protecting human
research subjects and the health equity aim of including NES in clinical trials. Thus, we seek to study the
development of a culturally appropriate and ethically exemplary informed consent process that is no less
efficient for IRB staff, researchers, and patients than is the pathway for English speaking patients."
11050676,"UCI ADRC Overall
Project Summary/Abstract
The central theme of the University of California, Irvine Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (UCI ADRC) is
to identify, quantify, and validate factors that influence the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) across the lifespan.
Given its diverse and multifactorial nature, it is critical to understand the etiology and progression of this
insidious brain disorder at multiple dimensions, including clinically and neuropathologically, and to employ
novel scientific approaches so that we can advance knowledge and better diagnose, prevent and cure the
disease. The UCI ADRC has a strong history of integrating basic, clinical, and translational science to gain
insights into AD pathogenesis and to help meet some of the goals of the National Alzheimer's Project Act.
First, our Center has a distinguished record of studying the disease in diverse patient cohorts: Uniform Data
Set (UDS) Cohort, which includes cognitively normal individuals and individuals with mild cognitive impairment
(prodromal AD); adults with Down syndrome, representing the largest genetically at-risk population for AD; and
90+, which show great disparity between AD pathology and cognitive loss and are among the oldest group of
individuals to develop AD. Together, these cohorts enable interrogation of important novel questions related to
age, susceptibility and resilience, using innovative outcomes ranging from in vivo biomarker characterization to
modern pathological outcomes such as post-mortem imaging and microglial staining. Second, the UCI ADRC
has a history of innovation that has helped advance the field; the development of the nation's first induced
pluripotent stem cell bank for AD as part of the ADRC network and our recently established Consent-to-
Contact recruitment registry are recent examples of this innovation. Third, our Center continues to evolve.
Given the expertise, productivity, and resources devoted the study of special populations at UCI, we have
initiated two Special Populations Cores, one focused on Down syndrome and one focused on the oldest old
(90+). These Cores will interact with the other cores of the ADRC to produce novel data and resources
available to ADRC investigators, including through our newly established Biomarker Core. Finally, we have
established a new Research and Education Component in this proposal, which harnesses the long-standing
passionate commitment to training the next generation of clinicians and scientists at UCI. In sum, the UCI
ADRC brings energetic and innovative multi-dimensional and multidisciplinary approaches toward addressing
the national epidemic of AD."

This project will continue the delivery of Coast Guard required training for commercial fishermen to reduce the
loss of life due to falls overboard and vessel loss. This project is very relevant to public health in the workplace.
Commercial fishing is usually ranked the first or second highest risk occupation. The Coast Guard requires
monthly emergency drills on most commercial fishing vessels that work offshore. These drills cover the
prevention and emergency response of crew during the emergencies of fall overboard, flooding, fire and
abandon ship. These emergencies caused the majority of deaths from 2000-2015 and over the last three
decades. The drills must be conducted by a formally trained Emergency Drill Conductor (EDC). As the only
provider of Coast Guard Accepted EDC training in Alaska, we intend to use our vast experience and extensive
partnerships in the industry and in rural ports of Alaska to continue the availability of this performance based,
hands on training to a new generation of fishermen.
In this project, we will continue to hold our Coast Guard Accepted Marine Safety Instructor-Training (MSIT)
workshops, to train new port based instructors to deliver EDC training to fishermen in their own or nearby
fishing ports
Having port based instructors eliminates the need to travel to distant rural ports- a difficulty in these times.
Alaska led the nation in fishing fatalities 30 years ago with 30 to 40 fatalities a year- a major public health and
safety issue. However, in part through the past training of fishermen in EDC and other safety courses, Alaska
now has the third lowest number of fatalities out of the four main regions of the nation. Average yearly fatalities
in the last 10 years are in single digits. Over 277 fishermen have survived an emergency at sea who have had
training in our past projects.
This project will also address the main cause of injury in Alaska fisheries, which are chronic Muscular-Skeletal
Disorders (MSDs) of the upper extremities. These injuries have been the leading cause of insurance claims
according to data from the Alaska Fishermen’s Fund, a long established state run insurance pool. We have
experience with delivering in-person ergonomics training to thousands of fish workers. However, we intend to
transfer our commercial fishing training to an on-line optional format, due to present and future travel
restrictions and costs."
11036741,"Classic Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (cEDS) is characterized by skin hyperextensibility and fragility, wound
healing problems, and joint hypermobility. cEDS is caused by genetic defects in genes that encode type V
collagen (COL5A1 and COL5A2). Chronic widespread pain is one of the most common and intractable, yet
barely studied, complaints in all EDS patients, and cEDS patients are in great need of new non-opioid pain
therapies. Research into the characteristics and mechanisms of pain in EDS is exceedingly limited. A unique
collaboration between the Chicago Center on Musculoskeletal Pain (C-COMP) and the Center for Medical
Genetics at Ghent University (Belgium) has uncovered critical, novel observations in cEDS patients and in
Col5a1 haploinsufficient (Col5a1+/-) mice, a validated model of cEDS. Quantitative sensory testing in cEDS
patients revealed mechanical pain hypersensitivity. Likewise, Col5a1+/- mice manifest widespread mechanical
allodynia, accompanied by abnormal skin innervation by nociceptors. Fibroblasts are the principal source of
abnormal type V collagen, and cEDS fibroblasts show transcriptome-wide changes, including genes related to
cell proliferation, migration, wound healing, and axonal guidance. While it has been recognized that fibroblasts
may contribute to peripheral sensitization of nociceptors through secretion of sensitizing molecules, in depth
studies into how fibroblasts communicate with the nociceptive system in peripheral tissues to initiate and/or
potentiate pain are surprisingly scant. Here, we will address this critical knowledge gap; we propose that cEDS
provides an excellent model for investigating how fibroblast-nociceptor interactions drive pain in cEDS and other
pain syndromes. We hypothesize that fibroblast-neuron interactions may cause hyperexcitability and/or
abnormal growth of nociceptors in the skin, two of the defining features of cEDS. We are in an unparalleled
position to examine this idea, owing to the unique, complementary resources and state-of-the-art techniques
present in our groups. In Aim 1, we will determine the innervation and cellular transcriptome in skin tissues of
cEDS vs control patients through immunohistochemistry and Visium. To do this, we will leverage the unique
cohort of molecularly and phenotypically characterized cEDS patients available through the Center for Medical
Genetics in Ghent, Belgium. In Aim 2, we will use a neuron-fibroblast microfluidic co-culture system to assess
the effect of Col5a1 mutant fibroblasts on neuronal excitability and neuronal growth/sprouting. In Subaim 2.1,
we will use murine cells to examine the effects of fibroblasts harboring a type V collagen defect on DRG neurons
in co-cultures. In Subaim 2.2, findings will be validated in human microfluidic co-cultures, using human iPSC-
derived sensory neurons with fibroblasts derived from cEDS patients or controls. We anticipate that the findings
generated from the proposed experiments will advance our knowledge of mechanisms underlying pain in cEDS,
and will generate important new information into mechanisms of more prevalent painful conditions where neuron-
fibroblast interactions play a role in the production of abnormal skin innervation and pain."
11044977,"In the VA system, hearing loss is the second-most common service-connected condition
affecting 933,182 Veterans, exceeded only by tinnitus which affects 1,121,709 Veterans (data
from Veterans Benefit Report for Fiscal Year 2016). In FY 2016, the VA dispensed 750,075
hearing aids at a net procurement of nearly $270 million (report generated from VA Denver
Acquisition and Logistics Center [DALC] Remote Order Entry System [ROES]). Half of the hearing
aids dispensed were to experienced hearing aid users receiving replacement hearing aids
(Dennis, 2014). VA Audiology caseload is significant and Veterans can experience long wait-times
for fitting appointments to obtain new hearing aids (Office of the Inspector General, 2014).
 The purpose of the fitting appointment is to program and verify the hearing aids and orient the
patient to hearing aid use/care. For patients obtaining replacement hearing aids, the orientation
typically is unnecessary, and the programming is simplified; consisting mainly of matching the
individual's real-ear aided response (REAR) and hearing aid output to appropriate target values.
In contrast to adults, REAR measurements are not well-tolerated by children due to the
requirement for placement of a probe tube in the ear canal. Therefore, a hearing aid fitting
procedure that circumvents the need for in situ REAR measurements (real ear coupler difference
or RECD) is the standard-of-care (SoC) for children. Considerable research clearly has shown the
equivalency of in situ REAR and RECD fitting procedures (e.g., Moodie et al., 1994). RECD fitting
procedures rarely are used with adults; however, such an approach could preclude the need for
direct physical contact with the patient at the time of the hearing aid fitting. Three experiments are
proposed. The purpose of the first study is to evaluate coupler-based fitting approach for groups
of experienced users obtaining replacement hearing aids and compare the accuracy of those
fittings to the prescription and their outcomes to norms. The second study aims to develop
correction factors for venting of open-fit hearing aids. The third study will focus on comparing
coupler-based fittings of open-fit hearing aids (using correction factors developed from study two
results) to an SoC (active control) group who will have their open-fit hearing aids fitted in face-to-
face appointment via standard in situ REAR procedures. In Study 1 and 3, both groups will return
for in situ REARs and self-report outcomes assessment one month after the hearing-aid fitting.
The results of this study should determine the efficacy of a RECD-based, hearing-aid fitting
approach for experienced hearing-aid users who are receiving replacement hearing aids
consisting of a variety of styles. If the approaches are equivalent, then this study will provide an
evidence-based, RECD fitting approach that should result in greater patient satisfaction and
reduced costs."

11047264,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The Texas D-CFAR Developmental Core B fosters the development of HIV-related research at Baylor
College of Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, and the Texas Biomedical
Research Institute through investigator-initiated pilot project awards, career development mentoring,
outreach programs targeted to high school students through early career faculty, and support services
for HIV investigators. Pilot project applications are solicited in high-priority areas of HIV research.
Applications undergo rigorous peer review modeled after the NIH system. Pilot grant outcomes are
tracked for a minimum of 5 years. Core B also supports the Substance Use Scientific Working Group
(SU-SWG) that addresses a critical research topic for people with HIV (PWH) in Texas. Core B
facilitates high priority areas of HIV research and SWG-targeted pilot project cycles, supplemented with
generous institutional funds provided by the Texas D-CFAR institutions. Infrastructure provided by Core
B enables the D-CFAR to respond to NIH supplement opportunities. Developmental Core B offers a
comprehensive and proactive mentoring program focused on junior investigators applying for pilot
project funding. A required Letter-of-Intent process links junior investigators with a research mentor
early in the pilot project grant writing process. The mentoring program facilitates the assembly of a
mentor team consisting of three mentors—research, peer, and career—for each junior investigator
applying for pilot project funding. To expand Core B outreach activities, the previous Diversity, Equity,
and Inclusion Pipeline Initiative (CDEIP) program (funded by NIH Supplements) will be expanded. This
expansion will leverage existing career pathway programming at D-CFAR Institutes – from high school
to early career faculty – to provide exposure to career opportunities and HIV science by implementing
age-appropriate interventions to enhance the interest, knowledge, skills and access needed to pursue
HIV research careers. Multifaceted evaluations of these approaches will determine which are most
effective in order to retain those for future iterations of the programs. Core B also sponsor an HIV
Research Forum series and an annual Texas D-CFAR Conference where HIV researchers throughout
Texas will present their research, allowing investigators to receive critical input and establish new
collaborations."
11047270,"Dysregulation of normal tissue repair processes can lead to fibrosis, a pathological feature of many diseases,
including chronic inflammatory conditions, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. Excessive accumulation of
extracellular matrix can occur in all tissues, and if progressive, can be fatal. The long-term goal of our group is
to understand the underlying cellular and molecular interactions that contribute to fibrosis, and to use this insight
to develop effective therapeutics to combat this condition, which accounts for up to 45% of all deaths in the
United States each year. Although long assumed to be irreversible, recent evidence from both preclinical studies
and clinical trials demonstrates that fibrosis can be halted and even reversed in vivo. However, there is a
significant gap in the development of safe and effective therapeutic interventions that directly target the mediators
of fibrotic pathogenesis. To address this gap, we have assembled an interdisciplinary team with distinct expertise
to develop and assess the in vivo efficacy of a novel cellular immunotherapy to combat fibrosis.
Fibrosis drives pathology in the chronic autoimmune disease systemic sclerosis (SSc). SSc has the highest case
fatality rate of any systemic autoimmune disease with no validated biomarkers or curative treatments. Multi-
tissue bioinformatic analyses implicate alternatively activated macrophages (MØs) as key drivers of SSc in
multiple end-target organs, suggesting these cells are a common feature across organs and subsets in SSc
patients. Thus, we hypothesize that targeting these pathogenic MØs directly will reduce fibrosis in SSc patients.
To test this hypothesis, we will engineer chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells to secrete anti-fibrotic mediators
and evaluate their therapeutic efficacy in vivo using multi-omic and spatial transcriptomic technologies developed
by the parent award. The development of this therapy, which will target pro-fibrotic MØs that drive fibrosis and
key secreted mediators of fibroblast activation, has potentially significant therapeutic benefit for patients that
suffer from many fibrotic conditions, including cancer. This proposal integrates the diverse expertise of each co-
Project Leader, with Dr. Pioli contributing MØ, fibrosis and SSc expertise, Dr. Huang contributing CAR T cell
therapy engineering expertise, and Dr. Kolling bringing expertise in the development and application of single
cell multi-omics and spatial transcriptomics approaches."
11046957,"ABSTRACT
Our vision is to unravel and ultimately reverse the intricate network of causal factors throughout the life course
that disrupts biological homeostasis to promote colorectal cancer (CRC) among individuals younger than age 50
years. Uniting leading scientific minds in early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC) research and complementary
fields, we have embraced disruptive, transdisciplinary approaches spanning cells to individuals to populations to
address the core Grand Challenge to “Determine why the incidence of early-onset cancers is rising globally”. We
will address specific questions of “the mechanisms linking lifetime exposures with cancer initiation and
promotion” by focusing on EOCRC as an ideal model for early-onset cancer due to the availability of well-
characterized animal models and well-established and prevalent precursor lesion, the adenomatous polyp
(adenoma), offering a unique opportunity for interception and prevention. Our work will transform the field by
directly addressing our overarching goal to “identify and understand the processes through which different
biological and environmental factors cause early-onset cancers”, and reverse the burden in a timely, effective,
feasible, inclusive fashion. Our team, both working independently and in collaboration, has uncovered several
risk factors that are likely to be drivers for the rising incidence for EOCRC. We are now uniquely positioned to
translate etiologic understanding to actionable prevention by identifying novel factors, including environmental
and social determinants, and deepening our understanding into overlooked dimensions of exposure throughout
the life course. The unprecedented scope and scale of our proposal can only be supported through Cancer
Grand Challenges since our “high-risk” disruptive approach requires deep interactions between work packages
(WP)s led by leaders in diverse disciplines. This will enable incorporation of fresh perspectives to move beyond
traditional risk-factor epidemiology toward an integrated, mechanistically-informed model with population scale
and cellular resolution of the multiple and cumulative “hits” that promote EOCRC to inform the development of
actionable prevention. Our innovations intersect epidemiology, small molecule discovery, genomics, stem cell
biology, immunology, and computational biology with these key features: 1) harmonization of diverse cohorts
with data and biospecimens collected across the lifecourse; 2) innovative and reliable analysis of small molecules
to detect novel exposures; 3) high-resolution technologies for analysis of target tissues; 4) model systems
capable of interrogating accumulating exposures across the lifespan and their impact on the cellular ecosystem;
5) prevention through risk assessment and pharmacologic/lifestyle interventions. Collectively, our work will serve
as an exemplar for transforming research into other early-onset cancers."
11047003,"SAMBAI - Bridging Research Investigations of cancer Disparities and Global Equity (BRIDGE)
Research Abstract
Background
Prostate, breast, and pancreatic cancers all have a disproportionately higher rate of aggressive tumor
grade and early onset in Black patients, with recent spikes of high incidence in West African nations
compared to other African regions. The genetic background correlations implicate predispositions.
Members of our SAMBAI team of investigators have pioneered genomics in cancer disparities research,
and over the past two decades, we have uncovered compelling evidence of distinct immunological
mechanisms associated with genetic ancestry. Our SAMBAI team members have developed methods to
quantify environmental exposures and interrogate the lived experiences of marginalized populations,
including epigenetic responses to racism.
Aims
We will partner with scientists across the US, Africa, and the UK to build an unprecedented resource, the
SAMBAI Biobank and Data Repository for Cancer Equity Research. We will generate a comprehensive,
accurate, and relevant measurement of social, environmental, genetic, and immunological factors to
complete an integrated set of analyses to define the causal vs. modifier relationships of disparate
outcomes in diverse underserved populations. We will establish a sustainable framework for team science
approaches with under-represented partners and establish best practices for coordinating cancer equity
research on a global scale.
Methods
We propose to utilize multiple methods across our different work packages. Social Determinants include
self-reporting surveys and database abstractions. Exposomes utilize mass spectrometry of plasma.
Genomics will utilize three sequencing methods on germline and tumor tissue, including long read,
short/deep, and ultra-low pass whole genome sequencing. Lastly, immunological profiles will be
measured with spatial transcriptomics and circulating multiplex immunoassays. These data require novel
computational frameworks, including cloud-based virtualization and the use of machine learning
technologies to identify novel associations across the strata of social to spatial data elements and across
our diverse geographic and ancestral SAMBAI cohorts.
Utility and Impact
We will improve research capacity in under-resourced environments for large-scale cancer research and
equitable access to data with equitable feasibility to improve treatment and outcomes. We will define
interactions of environmental exposures, social determinants, and genetic ancestry that determine
immunological landscapes of primary tumors and/or circulating immunological profiles in patients of
African descent. Our project will contribute a data repository with 100K features/patient, for 40,000
patients. The impact on this population includes a novel trial design, in collaboration with our patient
advocacy partners, to ensure that the specific genomic and immunological features we uncover become
part of targeted precision oncology theragnostic options."
11042588,"Project Summary
In this project we will construct a powerful new tool to systematically identify infection-relevant genes in the
dental caries pathogen Streptococcus mutans. Sequence-defined arrayed mutant libraries are available for
several medical and model bacterial species. These tools have greatly accelerated the pace of genetic screens
and the identification of important pathogenic genetic determinants. We will construct an arrayed transposon
mutant library in the model laboratory strain UA159 and use a sequencing approach to determine the identity
of each mutant. After constructing the library, we will use it to study genetic determinants of sucrose-mediated
biofilm formation, which is a critical virulence trait of S. mutans. We will also use a comparative transposon
sequencing (Tn-seq) approach to identify genes that provide a selective advantage in biofilms. The results of
this research will include the following: 1) construction of an arrayed and sequence defined transposon mutant
resource for the S. mutans research community, 2) an improved understanding of the genetic determinants of
sucrose-mediated biofilm formation both in monoculture and in complex communities, and 3) we expect this
knowledge to contribute to the development of new approaches to target and reduce S. mutans colonization of
the oral cavity. This project will also provide training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students
from Arkansas, an area that is underrepresented in biomedical research."
11047866,"Project Summary
Hydrogels are widely used in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine due to their ability to
mimic the physical properties of various tissues, host encapsulated cells, and serve as models
for diseased and traumatized tissue. Despite these advantages, they face many limitations that
hinder their utility and impede their adoption. A primary limitation is their inability to support cell
motility and proliferation, the elaboration of extracellular matrix (ECM) components, and the
development of de novo tissue. These limitations are primarily attributed to a lack of
hierarchical structure bridging the macromolecular and tissue length scales. Conventional,
homogeneous polymeric hydrogels, for instance, lack long range architectural features, such as
micron-scale porosity.
Recently, granular hydrogel scaffolds, a new class of materials composed of densely-packed
hydrogel microparticles, has been introduced and rapidly adopted. These scaffolds offer many
advantages over conventional hydrogels for tissue engineering. Leveraging advances in high-
throughput microfluidic emulsion templating, hydrogel particles can be produced in sufficiently
large quantities to enable the assembly of macroscale materials. These granular scaffolds offer
significantly increased porosity, facilitating the infiltration of cells and the rapid diffusional
exchange of nutrients and waste products. Moreover, particles can be designed independently
of macroscale requirements, effectively decoupling material stiffness from porosity. Beyond
these design advantages, granular scaffolds can be injected, 3D printed, or molded into
arbitrary shapes.
This proposal seeks to extend the known advantages of granular gels by incorporating newly
developed microfabrication capabilities. The Oakey lab has recently demonstrated the ability to
fabricate heterogeneous particles with network architecture sculpted on the nanoscale. This
capability offers several unique advantages including tunable rheological properties, controlled
degradation, and quantitatively tailored biofunctional interfaces. We will use these capabilities
to produce granular scaffolds as a medium to study fundamental and poorly understood
questions of cell motility and proliferation within granular scaffolds. This knowledge will then be
applied to develop translational applications for granular scaffolds in cartilage regeneration and
peripheral nerve allografts. Our interdisciplinary team of researchers have a track record of
productive research collaboration and mentoring and each investigator provides a specific and
complementary expertise that will inform the rapid acceleration of granular scaffold
development. The overlapping aims and activities between all projects will ensure that the
findings from each project inform the others. The Specific Aims of this collaborative team
project, described as a co-project and led by one investigator, are:
co-Project 1: To microfabricate hydrogel particles, cell carriers, and granular scaffolds for each
subsequent co-Project. This co-Project will also investigate possible roles for scaffold
architecture and particle biochemistry in the assembly of ECM components in de novo tissue.
co-Project 2: To develop a scalable experimental platform to visualize and quantitatively
assess changes in cell behavior as a response to encapsulation in, with a specific focus upon
understanding cell migration and invasion (outgrowth) within 3D granular scaffolds.
co-Project 3: To tailor granular scaffolds granular scaffolds to promote chondrocyte outgrowth
and thereby cartilage repair by cartilage fragments.
co-Project 4: To develop sacrificial granular scaffolds as cell carriers for immunomodulatory
regulatory T cell delivery and release to peripheral nerve allografts.
The project scope and outcomes connect directly to Wyoming INBRE, an award with research
focus areas in cell biology and chronic disease. This supplementary award will use granular
gels made by a unique particle fabrication strategy to study questions of fundamental and
applied interest to cell biology while informing the technology's translation to address two
chronic diseases: functional and traumatic nerve loss and cartilage injury and degradation."

Title: PROTECT – Harnessing PROTEin degradation for Advanced Childhood
Tumors
Abstract:
Background
Survival rates for children with solid tumors, including brain, have largely
plateaued over the past three decades making them the most common cause of
disease-related mortality in this age group. After decades of optimizing
chemotherapy and radiotherapy protocols, higher cure rates for childhood solid
tumors will no longer be achieved by “more of the same.” Rather, cures will
require innovative interventions that specifically target the unique biology of these
tumors, which are often driven by oncogenic fusions and other pediatric-specific
oncoproteins historically considered difficult drug targets. With advances in
targeted protein degradation and chemical interventions to inhibit protein-protein
interactions, it has recently become tractable to target these proteins previously
thought to be “undruggable”. Moreover, unbiased functional screening approaches,
such as CRISPR-Cas9, have revealed new pediatric cancer synthetic lethal
liabilities in need of targeted inhibitors.
Aims
We aim to lead the transformation of delivering such specific treatments to our
young patients harnessing the power of a highly interdisciplinary and collaborative
team of world-leading experts in pediatric oncology, targeted protein degradation,
high-throughput chemical screening, medicinal chemistry, structural biology,
tumor biology, preclinical drug testing, and clinical trials, complemented by a
trans-Atlantic group of engaged patient representatives.
Methods
A bold plan will be pursued with a portfolio of projects that balance very high-risk
efforts with others nearing clinical implementation. We will focus on
drivers/targets in the following diseases: Ewing sarcoma, neuroblastoma, synovial
sarcoma, ependymoma and high-grade glioma. We will explore different
approaches to target these as yet undrugged paediatric drivers/dependencies, to
overcome resistance to available targeted inhibitors, and to improve the efficacy
and therapeutic window of CAR-T treatments.
How the results will be used
The aspiration of our team is to establish a sustainable platform for repeated
developmental cycles of paediatric-specific drug development for emerging targets
including a viable financial model to de-risk such developments for such rare
pediatric tumors to the direct benefit of our patients. Specifically, we anticipate
success through (i) delivering at least one optimised protein degrader for its
application in early-phase clinical trials, (ii) enabling the druggability of previously
“undruggable” targets, (iii) providing mechanistic insights into disease, novel
targets, and therapy resistance mechanisms and ways to tackle them."
11046075,"Project Summary
Stimulant use disorders, including cocaine and methamphetamine use disorders, impact the lives of millions of
Americans and are associated with significant health and social consequences. There are currently no FDA-
approved medications for treatment of stimulant use disorders. Most of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
to find effective medications have been of short duration, typically lasting 8-12 weeks, and had small sample
sizes. Attaining sustained abstinence from stimulants may require longer treatment and detecting these effects
may require larger samples. However, available trials can provide information on short-term outcomes of
treatment that are achieved earlier and less stringent than abstinence and, thus, help identify candidate
medications for future long-term and larger trials. Drug craving is probably the most promising of such short-
term outcomes. Stimulant use disorders are characterized by periods of heavy use followed by short periods of
abstinence with withdrawal symptoms. These symptoms last a few days and are followed by increasing drug
craving which often leads to relapse. Drug craving is a central phenomenon in these recurring cycles of drug
use. Nevertheless, little research has specifically focused on craving as an outcome of stimulant use disorder
or on reduction of craving as a mediator of abstinence or reduction in drug use. In the proposed project, we
plan to examine craving as an outcome of stimulant use disorder as well as a mediator for other outcomes.
More specifically, in Aim 1, we will compare the effect of 9 medications (in 11 RCTs) on stimulant drug craving.
In Aim 2, we will assess the association of change in craving during trial with change in other outcomes and
the potential mediating role of craving in the effect of treatments on these outcomes. In Aim 3 we will explore
the variations in the effects of medications and in the association of craving with other outcomes in subgroups
of patients. We propose to use individual participant data from 1,845 patients in 11 RCTs conducted in the
context of NIDA’s Clinical Trials Network (CTN) and related trials to accomplish these study Aims. The project
has the potential to significantly contribute to a better understanding of the role of craving in continued
stimulant use disorder and the potential effect of medications on stimulant use disorders as mediated by their
anti-craving qualities. Medications with anti-craving properties are currently used in treatment of nicotine and
alcohol use disorders and have shown promising results in treatment of stimulant use disorders. The project
also represents an efficient use of NIDA’s RCT data to answer new questions that were not addressed in the
original studies. The findings would help identify candidate medications for future adequately powered trials
based on the short-term anti-craving effects of candidate medications and contribute significantly to the
ongoing efforts to find effective medication treatments for stimulant use disorders."
11043483,"A major challenge at the interface of mathematics and molecular and cellular biology remains the
 development of accurate and predictive models of epigenetic mechanisms. While eukaryotic transcription
 is substantially influenced via epigenetic mechanisms, the majority of mathematical models pay little
attention to this crucial regulation modality. Herein we propose a theoretical, computational, and
experimental framework to model epigenetic regulatory networks in single cells. Herein we introduce a
theoretical, computational, and experimental framework to model epigenetic regulatory networks in single
cells. Specifically, we propose to assemble and stably integrate epigenetic regulators and increasingly
 complex circuits in human cells. These stably integrated circuits will serve as biomolecular ""ground truth""
for inference and characterization techniques comprising theory and computational analysis in an iterative
manner. Using theoretical analysis coupled with experimentation, we will comprehensively characterize
 the circuits to identify general principles of epigenetic mechanisms with emphasis on probing their
 dynamic behavior and stability. The transforming quality of our proposal is based on the following notions.
We will establish a methodology to rapidly assemble and stably integrate libraries of CRISPR-based
 epigenetic regulators in human cells. These libraries will cover a wide parameter space providing wealth
 of data for extracting parameters to inform the mathematic models. Our methodology for rapid library
assembly is a significant advance for the mammalian synthetic biology field, where progress is hampered
 by slow experimental timescales. We will study the properties of epigenetic circuits stably integrated in a
 panel of human cell lines. We will test the boundaries of genome editing of safe harbor loci and develop
 new methods for integrating large DNA cassettes. We will develop a theoretical and computational
framework to model single-cell stochastic gene expression kinetics in hybrid gene regulatory networks.
We will validate and calibrate the models using experimental data generated using custom epigenetic
 regulators. We will correlate the effects of network topology and mode of regulation on the stationary and
 dynamic behavior of stochastic gene expression. Validated models of epigenetic regulation will be used to
 predict the conditions capable to produce multistability, critical phase transitions, and oscillations."
11044975,"Current traditional prosthetic chest harnessing worn by women Veterans with limb loss) is less than
optimal due to female anatomy. We know from the sports [1] and seat belt/airbag [2] literature that breast
tissue injuries can disrupt the blood flow to the breast resulting in swelling, significant blood loss,
hematoma, fat necrosis, and oil cyst hematoma. Injury to the mammary ducts can affect the future or
current flow of breast milk [3]. More commonly, smaller superficial arteries along with veins become
injured, leading to more localized injury and less serious bleeding and bruising. While there is no known
research on whether a prosthetic harness can cause injury to breast tissue, we know that frequent
wearing of tight clothing [4] can cause bruising, swelling, and thrombophlebitis. We have designed a bra

experience is judged beyond SPIRE resources/scope of this study. The exclusion criteria are: (1) open
wounds in the upper torso or extremities and (2) body-powered prosthetic users due to the dynamic
requirements of the harness. We will pursue Using Brasthesis with body powered prosthetics in a
subsequent study. Once the patient has provided written informed consent, two bras will be ordered. One
bra the patient will wear. The second bra will be deconstructed and reconstructed for individualized
suspensory harness strapping. At the time of Brasthesis fitting, baseline will be collected,
demographic and clinical data and satisfaction, function, and comfort outcomes
measures. After fitting, the participant will wear Brasthesis for four weeks. Participants
will be contacted weekly to track wearing time in days per week and hours per day (Aim 1). We will also
employ a Jawbone Up 24 activity tracker as a quantitative proxy of prosthesis wear time.
Pre to post ordinal change in wearing time, satisfaction, function, and comfort outcomes will be
analyzed using quantitative descriptive analyses. At the end of the wearing period, PI Winkler will conduct
semi-structured phone interviews with participants and the prosthetist. Interviews will be transcribed
and analyzed using thematic analysis guided by descriptive phenomenology theory. The semi-
structured interview will have three overall discussion points: (1) Describe the barriers
encountered while fitting Brasthesis , (2) How did you manage strap placement based
on the presence and length of the residual limb and the available skin surface area
available for contact with the prosthetic sensor, and (3) How does Brasthesis compare
with your traditional prosthesis? Aim 2 will use pressure mapping technology to compare the
residual limb and intact limb under arm pressure distribution data for Brasthesis and participants’
traditional prostheses. We will create color-coded ‘heat maps’ that directly link pressure
values to the three-dimensional anatomy of each participant."
11044976,"Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a signature disorder of recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, with
over 300,000 service members receiving a first-time mTBI diagnosis since 2000. Though the majority of mTBI
cases do see a return to normal functioning, a so-called “miserable minority” experience persistent symptoms of
post-concussive syndrome (PCS) that can result in prolonged impairment. For these individuals, rehabilitative
interventions are frequently ineffective. Identifying biological factors that might confer risk for persistent
symptoms and/or factors that might predict rehabilitative outcomes would be a critical step towards enhancing
the personalization and optimization of rehabilitative care for mTBI.
 A growing literature suggests that the persistence of PCS symptoms may be linked to factors separate
from the head injury itself, including premorbid/comorbid psychopathology. As such, factors associated with
vulnerability for psychopathology, such as genetics, likely confer risk for sub-optimal recovery following mTBI.
Recent advances in large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have helped characterize genetic
vulnerability for a wide range of disorders. Building off of these advances, we can use GWAS results to calculate
polygenic risk scores (PRSs), which calculate an individual's cumulative genetic risk for a given disorder or trait
by summing the number of risk alleles across the entire genome, weighted by each allele's relative risk. Cross-
disorder validation using PRS (i.e. using PRS from one disorder/trait to predict the prevalence of another
disorder/trait within the same person) has been used to identify shared genetic etiology between putatively-
related conditions. Therefore, PRS scores derived from mTBI-related conditions could pave the way for a more
robust understanding of how genes moderate mTBI recovery.
 The proposed study will collect genome-wide data on veterans with a history of mTBI from two sources.
The first will be local sample of 1000 veterans referred for mTBI treatment through the Minneapolis VA Health
Care System (MVAHCS) Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation service and Polytrauma Rehabilitation Center.
The second will be veterans assessed for mTBI in two large-scale consortia efforts: the Psychiatric Genomics
Consortium-PTSD Working Group (PGC-PTSD) and the Chronic Effects of Neurotrauma Consortium (CENC).
For all participants, we will derive PRSs from GWAS data linked to nine disorders/traits that are theorized to be
related to mTBI outcomes. These disorders/traits fall into the following broad categories: psychological
(posttraumatic stress disorder, major depressive disorder, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, cross-disorder
risk), neurological (Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease), cognitive (educational attainment, childhood
intelligence), and subjective (subjective well-being). Aim 1 of the proposed study will determine the association
between PRSs and the presence of persistent PCS symptoms in local and consortia samples, with an exploratory
follow-up (Aim 1A) using each individual's history of traumatic events as an environmental stressor in a polygenic
gene-by-environment interaction analysis. Aim 2 will use PRSs to predict treatment response in veterans referred
for treatment of mTBI-related symptoms (including management of PCS or PTSD). Exploratory aim 3 will conduct
a phenome-wide association study using a wide variety of phenotypic data extracted from computerized records
(including diagnoses, health factors, and neural indices). This approach can be used to identify plausible
intermediate phenotypes, which would shed light on mechanisms by which genetic risk is conferred.
 The proposed project would be the largest to look at genetic factors associated with PCS and the first to
look at genetic factors associated with mTBI rehabilitation. The results of this project could be directly
interpretable as a personalized genetic profile for mTBI recovery, which could substantially improve the precision
and effectiveness of rehabilitative care for mTBI sequelae."
11045155,"PROJECT SUMMARY (unchanged from currently approved project)
In this project, we will develop and validate clinical polygenic risk scores (PRS) for six common
diseases: coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes mellitus, breast cancer,
colorectal cancer, and prostate cancer. This test will then be used in a point-of-care pragmatic
randomized controlled trial of PRS testing and linked clinical recommendations compared to
usual care (UC). Enrolled patients without a known diagnosis of any of the six target diseases
will undergo clinical PRS genotyping. Patients with at least one PRS indicating high risk (odds
ratio, ORPRS, ≥2.0) will be randomized to have them and their primary care provider receive their
high-PRS results at baseline (PRS arm) or after a 24-month observation period (UC arm),
reported along with evidence-based screening and management recommendations. Patients
will be observed for 24 months for the primary clinical outcome of time-to-diagnosis of any one
of the 6 target diseases. Secondary clinical outcomes will include changes in clinical
management and patient health behaviors. Enrolled patients with all ORPRS<2.0 will be observed
as concurrent controls for the same outcomes. Additional implementation outcomes will be
collected over the course of the study, including provider knowledge and beliefs about PRS,
patient activation, medication adherence, and costs."
11049329,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Human herpesviruses can cause congenital birth defects in neonates and a wide range of disease in humans,
with particularly devastating effects in immunocompromised individuals. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated
herpesvirus (KSHV) is the causative agent of Kaposi's sarcoma and other cancers, with high prevalence in sub-
Saharan Africa. There is no cure for any herpesvirus; most existing antivirals target a single viral process and
can lead to resistance mutations. The recent development of a herpesviral packaging inhibitor highlights the
viral genome packaging machinery as an attractive target for novel antivirals. The herpesviral packaging
machinery is conceptually similar to that of bacteriophages, yet it has additional complexities that include
factors of unknown function. In this proposal, I outline my vision to understand the molecular mechanism of
herpesvirus packaging. I will determine the function of an essential factor in herpesvirus packaging that has
long evaded mechanistic dissection using state-of-the-art proteomics and microscopy approaches. I will also
develop a new strategy to apply deep mutational scanning approaches to herpesviral proteins. In parallel, I will
determine the structure of the KSHV terminase, the viral molecular motor that packages the viral genome into
the nascent capsid. I will then reconstitute the essential components of the KSHV packaging machinery and
use these to develop an in vitro packaging assay. This assay will be leveraged to screen for new antivirals and
determine the molecular underpinnings of existing drugs that target the packaging machinery. The proposed
studies will build a foundation to address long-standing, fundamental questions in DNA virus packaging and
understand the mechanism of anti-herpesvirals."

The landscape of clinical research is in a constant state of evolution as a greater understanding of unmet patient
needs and current clinical trial limitations are exposed, necessitating innovative solutions to address the
challenges encountered by traditional clinical trial paradigms. One of the most pressing issues is the difficulty in
recruiting and retaining diverse patient populations, leading to significant underrepresentation of minority groups,
rural communities, elderly patients, and individuals with limited access to healthcare resources. This lack in
diversity not only skews our understanding of treatment efficacy and safety but also compromises the
generalizability of data generated from traditional trials. In response to these challenges, hybrid decentralized
clinical trials (DCTs) have emerged as a promising alternative. Hybrid DCTs allow for tasks aligned with clinical
practice to be performed by local health care providers (HCPs) with their established patient relationships and
limit clinical trial site visits to those with complex procedures that require extensive knowledge of the
investigational product. By leveraging the capabilities of both local HCPs and academic medical centers,
implementing digital health tools, and minimizing the need for frequent in-person visits, hybrid DCTs prioritize
patient comfort and convenience while breaking down geographic and socioeconomic barriers. Here we outline
a comprehensive plan to establish the Hybrid Operations to Promote Equity (HOPE) at the University of North
Carolina- Chapel Hill Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC). This proposal will address the health
disparities within North Carolina’s diverse patient population where nearly 30% of individuals identify as
belonging to a minority race across vast rural and urban regions. By engaging local healthcare providers in bi-
directional educational efforts and creating use-friendly tools, we aim to facilitate patient referrals and education
on clinical trial opportunities, particularly in underserved communities. Additionally, our approach includes the
development of specialized infrastructure and oversight procedures to streamline internal hybrid DCT
development and optimize clinical and regulatory procedures. Success of these endeavors will create a HOPE
network of healthcare providers across the state of NC with access to clinical trial opportunities for their patients
with most/all assessments occurring locally and will develop HOPE infrastructure to pilot hybrid DCT efforts to
expand awareness of and participation in clinical trials addressing disparities in cancer prevention, treatment,
and control across NC."

 Despite strong consensus that early, specialized intervention for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder
(ASD) can have a dramatic impact on outcomes, the U.S. health system’s capacity to provide such services is
severely challenged by the rapid rise in ASD prevalence. The long-term goal is to improve outcomes for
children with early signs of ASD by increasing the capacity to provide appropriately specialized treatment
within an existing infrastructure: the Part C Early Intervention (EI) service delivery system. Part C is publicly
funded, available in all areas, and serves children under age 3 who have developmental delays or disabilities.
Currently, the effectiveness of EI services is limited by high practice variation and infrequent use of evidence-
based interventions. The study objective is to improve services and outcomes for children with early signs of
ASD by conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) testing the effectiveness of training EI providers to
deliver Reciprocal Imitation Training (RIT). RIT is a naturalistic developmental behavioral intervention (NDBI)
that is ideally suited for EI settings because it is low intensity, play-based, easy to learn and implement, and
can be taught to families for their independent use, thus increasing intervention dosage.
 This RCT will employ a hybrid type 1 effectiveness/implementation design, and will use a unique mixed
methods approach to gather evidence that will be essential for implementing RIT at scale, pending positive trial
results. The sample includes 20 EI agencies across 4 U.S. States and comprises a total of 160 EI providers
and 440 families of children with early symptoms of ASD, which not only provides a robust sample size, but
also affords the opportunity to assess generalizability of this approach across regions that vary in their
implementation of Part C services. EI providers will be randomly assigned to the RIT training group (n=80) or
treatment as usual (TAU; n=80). Providers in both groups will identify 2-5 children in their caseload who are
16-30 months old with early symptoms of ASD (n=220 children per group). Intensive, state-of-the art, multi-
method assessment technology will be used to measure the impact of the intervention on children’s language
and social communication, as well as parents’ self-efficacy and well-being. Importantly, this study will examine
putative mechanisms (i.e., child gains in imitation and joint attention; parent contingent responsiveness)
through which the intervention improves clinically-relevant outcomes. Data regarding provider-initiated
modifications to the intervention and delivery will be analyzed to identify fidelity-consistent vs. fidelity-
inconsistent changes, which will inform refinement of future RIT training and quality assurance procedures. In
sum, this study will generate the evidence necessary to implement RIT at scale, thereby increasing the
capacity of the existing EI system to deliver effective, evidence-based intervention to the rapidly growing
population of children who show early signs of ASD."
11037223,"Craniofacial cartilage differentiation from human neural crest stem cells in 3D cultures
Birth defects and injuries to the head and face require surgical reconstruction and
rehabilitation. It is difficult to reconstruct cartilaginous features (nose, ears) with plastic
surgery techniques, and transplanted tissue is often rejected without
immunosuppressants. The ability to make bona fide craniofacial cartilage – cartilage of
the head and face – from patient-derived induced-pluripotent stem (iPS) cells to repair
these birth defects and injuries has tremendous translational applications, but is not yet
possible because we don't know enough about the mechanisms of differentiation that
form this tissue in human beings. Using stem cells is the key to understanding human-
specific cell signaling mechanisms that drive differentiation of craniofacial chondrocytes,
the cells that make cartilage. We have grown craniofacial cartilage organoids from
human neural crest stem cells (NCSCs) derived from embryonic stem cells (hESCs)
and induced-pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We have initiated detailed characterization
of gene expression at the RNA and protein level in these organoids with an eye towards
generating specific hypotheses about mechanisms of differentiation that may be
manipulated for recellularization of damaged or defective craniofacial cartilage. Our
strategy involves seeding cells in three dimensional (3D) matrices (hydrogels) together
with extracellular matrix (ECM) components that we have identified in organoids. We
focus on cells cultured in 3D scaffolds because we hypothesize that craniofacial
cartilage generation will be more rapid and reproducible in 3D constructed organoids
than in self-organizing organoids. We hypothesize that, in addition to being components
of the structurally resilient matrix that defines cartilage, the ECM components that we
identified play a profound cell signaling role in chondrocyte differentiation. A second
strategy is to target cell signaling pathways that are hypothesized to play a role in
specifying chondrocyte cell fate. We have identified a number of growth factors and
their receptors in two populations of cells that generate cartilage, mesenchyme cells
and nascent chondrocytes. We hypothesize that adding these growth factors will
activate cell signaling pathways to make cartilage differentiation more rapid and
reproducible in 3D cultures. This project will combine NCSC differentiation with 3D
bioprinting with an eye towards scaling up to grow functional, transplantable craniofacial
cartilage in the lab. These studies will considerably advance an innovative approach to
tissue engineering towards the long-term goal of building a nose, ear, or other
cartilaginous structures of the head and face using human stem cells."

The aims of the DC CFAR Pathway Program are designed to increase the diversity in HIV research by
providing an opportunity to high school and undergraduate students to participate in research and developing a
sense of self-efficacy and community that will help to retain these students in HIV research and to incorporate
diversity in all facets of their future academic careers. The DC CFAR Developmental Core promotes and
supports innovative, collaborative, and multidisciplinary HIV research through a dynamic mentoring program
that supports the career progression of early stage, new, and transitioning HIV investigators with an emphasis
on those from gender, racial, and ethnic groups who are underrepresented in the HIV research field. The
current revision proposal to include the CFAR Pathway Program within the Developmental Core, enhances our
existing aims by prioritizing high school (HS), undergraduate (UG) and graduate students in mentored research
and providing a holistic pre-professional approach to build a sense of community by working together within
our CFAR and within our broader community through outreach and volunteer activities. The first phase of our
program is focused on recruiting and supporting high school and undergraduate students in mentored
research. Professional and community development will be an integral part of the training paradigm
with near-peer mentoring lead by graduate students being a focal point of the program. As the program
develops, the graduate students will take more of a leadership role. We have also implemented, in conjunction
with UCSF and Providence Pathway programs a mechanism for Scholar networking on the national level. The
long-term goal of the program is to expand the recruitment and support mechanisms to include graduate and
post-doctoral fellows in ways that complement our current efforts in support of Early-Stage Investigators (ESI)
in HIV research. To achieve our current goal we will address the following Specific Aims:
1. Develop a pathway into HIV research for HS students by providing them research engagement
 opportunities that promote diversity.
2. Provide UG students an HIV research training and mentored support program that promotes diversity so
 that they may transition into doctoral and professional degree programs.
3. Implement a pathway program that adopts a holistic pre-professional approach to develop research and
 leadership skills for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students from groups underrepresented in
 the HIV field.
This program brings together a comprehensive program of research, community and professional development
to introduce and encourage students to pursue HIV research as their academic career. The long-term goal is to
build upon this program on a yearly basis to recruit new cohorts, provide multi-year support to our UG students
and expand financial support to recruit and retain URM graduate and post-doctoral fellows in HIV research."

The District of Columbia Center for AIDS Research (DC CFAR) is one of 19 NIH-funded CFARs across the
United States that have the shared goal of supporting and promoting multi-disciplinary HIV research at their
institutions. In 2021 at the request of NIH, the DC CFAR developed and coordinated the “CFAR Diversity,
Equity and Inclusion Pathway Initiative” (CDEIPI) to widen the pathway to careers in HIV science for young
scholars from groups underrepresented in HIV science and medicine with an emphasis on racial and ethnic
minorities. With supplemental funding from the NIH to support CDEIPI for three consecutive years from 2021-
2023, CDEIPI grew rapidly with CFARs developing a variety of innovative programs including didactic training,
mentored research experiences, and summer residential programs. Over the initial 2.5 years of the program,
there were >1,300 applicants and >600 participants in 39 CDEIPI programs guided by 206 mentors.
In December 2023, the NIH issued a limited competition funding opportunity to enable CFARs to incorporate
pathway programs into the developmental work of the CFAR program rather than through annual supplements.
This proposal then would support the transition of the CDEIPI CC to the “CFAR Pathway Program Coordinating
Center” (CPPCC) which would be incorporated into the DC CFAR Administrative Core. The Specific Aims of
the CPPCC are to coordinate CFAR pathway programs for students from groups underrepresented in the HIV
scientific workforce, support a national network of HIV scientists and educators to develop pathway programs,
and rigorously monitor and evaluate short- and long-term pathway program outcomes to inform best training
and mentoring practices.
The CPPCC will include an Administrative Core for overall coordination and as the point of contact with NIH, a
Program Core to identify best practices and common challenges for CFAR pathway programs, and an
Evaluation Core to coordinate the monitoring and evaluation of CFAR pathway programs. The added value of
CFAR pathway programs is that they provide HIV research and training opportunities to engage the next
generation of diverse students in HIV scientific careers who can then contribute to ending the HIV epidemic in
the United States."

Our vision is to unravel and ultimately reverse the intricate network of causal factors throughout the life course
that disrupts biological homeostasis to promote colorectal cancer (CRC) among individuals younger than age 50
years. Uniting leading scientific minds in early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC) research and complementary
fields, we have embraced disruptive, transdisciplinary approaches spanning cells to individuals to populations to
address the core Grand Challenge to “Determine why the incidence of early-onset cancers is rising globally”. We
will address specific questions of “the mechanisms linking lifetime exposures with cancer initiation and
promotion” by focusing on EOCRC as an ideal model for early-onset cancer due to the availability of well-
characterized animal models and well-established and prevalent precursor lesion, the adenomatous polyp
(adenoma), offering a unique opportunity for interception and prevention. Our work will transform the field by
directly addressing our overarching goal to “identify and understand the processes through which different
biological and environmental factors cause early-onset cancers”, and reverse the burden in a timely, effective,
feasible, inclusive fashion. Our team, both working independently and in collaboration, has uncovered several
risk factors that are likely to be drivers for the rising incidence for EOCRC. We are now uniquely positioned to
translate etiologic understanding to actionable prevention by identifying novel factors, including environmental
and social determinants, and deepening our understanding into overlooked dimensions of exposure throughout
the life course. The unprecedented scope and scale of our proposal can only be supported through Cancer
Grand Challenges since our “high-risk” disruptive approach requires deep interactions between work packages
(WP)s led by leaders in diverse disciplines. This will enable incorporation of fresh perspectives to move beyond
traditional risk-factor epidemiology toward an integrated, mechanistically-informed model with population scale
and cellular resolution of the multiple and cumulative “hits” that promote EOCRC to inform the development of
actionable prevention. Our innovations intersect epidemiology, small molecule discovery, genomics, stem cell
biology, immunology, and computational biology with these key features: 1) harmonization of diverse cohorts
with data and biospecimens collected across the lifecourse; 2) innovative and reliable analysis of small molecules
to detect novel exposures; 3) high-resolution technologies for analysis of target tissues; 4) model systems
capable of interrogating accumulating exposures across the lifespan and their impact on the cellular ecosystem;
5) prevention through risk assessment and pharmacologic/lifestyle interventions. Collectively, our work will serve
as an exemplar for transforming research into other early-onset cancers."

The parent award for this project is the Center for Modeling Complex Interactions (CMCI), which focuses
on an approach that can be used to address many biomedical problems. This approach is team-based
interdisciplinary research with the goal of integrating modeling into biomedical research projects. CMCI
supports modelers by giving them opportunities to integrate into interdisciplinary teams and empiricists
by providing them access to relevant modeling expertise. This creates a community and a culture to
facilitate interdisciplinary research and enhances the rigor of biomedical research. Following the structure
of CMCI, we will build an interdisciplinary team with a shared scientific interest to understand the time
and space-dependent roles of type I interferon (IFN-I) responses in controlling respiratory viral infection
and limiting inflammation.
The proposed research activities include mathematical and computational approaches that will be
informed and validated by data generated from cell culture infection studies and mouse lung tissue
samples from previous infection studies. An innovative 2D spatiotemporal model of the lung will be built
and visualized in virtual reality. By using a tandem mathematical-experimental approach, we will predict
temporal dynamics of IFN-I (Aim 1) and uncover unforeseen spatial connections in an augmented reality
environment of IFN-I during influenza virus infection (Aim 2).
To develop and evaluate the predictive power of these innovative models, we propose forming an
interdisciplinary collaboration between scientists of the Departments of Biology, Mathematics, and Virtual
Technology and Design at the University of Idaho. The combined expertise in virology, immunology,
mathematics, and virtual technology is critical for addressing the complexity of IFN-I roles during
influenza virus infection. The knowledge gained through this project will lead to the development of
immune-based therapeutics for influenza and other respiratory viral infections. Further, this project will
create a community and a culture to facilitate interdisciplinary research at the University of Idaho."

Title: PROTECT – Harnessing PROTEin degradation for Advanced Childhood Tumors
Background
Survival rates for children with solid tumors, including brain, have largely plateaued over the past three
decades making them the most common cause of disease-related mortality in this age group. After decades of
optimizing chemotherapy and radiotherapy protocols, higher cure rates for childhood solid tumors will no
longer be achieved by “more of the same.” Rather, cures will require innovative interventions that specifically
target the unique biology of these tumors, which are often driven by oncogenic fusions and other pediatric-
specific oncoproteins historically considered difficult drug targets. With advances in targeted protein
degradation and chemical interventions to inhibit protein-protein interactions, it has recently become
tractable to target these proteins previously thought to be “undruggable”. Moreover, unbiased functional
screening approaches, such as CRISPR-Cas9, have revealed new pediatric cancer synthetic lethal liabilities in
need of targeted inhibitors.
Aims
We aim to lead the transformation of delivering such specific treatments to our young patients harnessing the
power of a highly interdisciplinary and collaborative team of world-leading experts in pediatric oncology,
targeted protein degradation, high-throughput chemical screening, medicinal chemistry, structural biology,
tumor biology, preclinical drug testing, and clinical trials, complemented by a trans-Atlantic group of engaged
patient representatives.
Methods
A bold plan will be pursued with a portfolio of projects that balance very high?risk efforts with others nearing
clinical implementation. We will focus on drivers/targets in the following diseases: Ewing sarcoma,
neuroblastoma, synovial sarcoma, ependymoma and high-grade glioma. We will explore different approaches
to target these as yet undrugged paediatric drivers/dependencies, to overcome resistance to available
targeted inhibitors, and to improve the efficacy and therapeutic window of CAR-T treatments.
How the results will be used
The aspiration of our team is to establish a sustainable platform for repeated developmental cycles of
paediatric-specific drug development for emerging targets including a viable financial model to de-risk such
developments for such rare pediatric tumors to the direct benefit of our patients. Specifically, we anticipate
success through (i) delivering at least one optimised protein degrader for its application in early-phase clinical
trials, (ii) enabling the druggability of previously “undruggable” targets, (iii) providing mechanistic insights into
disease, novel targets, and therapy resistance mechanisms and ways to tackle them."
11043672,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Lung endothelial barrier integrity at the level of adherens junctions (AJs) is required for lung fluid homeostasis.
A crucial mechanism contributing to the loss of endothelial barrier integrity in conditions such as pulmonary
edema is “stress failure” of pulmonary capillaries in response to high pressure. While it is known that AJs,
comprised of VE-cadherin and associated catenin proteins, restrict endothelial permeability, little is known about
how mechanical forces, specifically vessel wall tension, control endothelial permeability and pulmonary edema.
Our Supporting Data describe the potentially important role of hydrostatic pressure in microvessels in activating
the mechanosensor Piezo1 in endothelial cells (ECs) and in increasing endothelial barrier permeability. We
observed that activation of Piezo1 induced intracellular Ca2+ signaling, which in turn, caused phosphorylation of
VE-cadherin and increased microvascular permeability. These findings have for the first time linked increased
tension to which ECs are exposed to the activation of Piezo1 and disassembly of AJs, leading to the
fundamental question “how does tension sensed at the plasma membrane of ECs by Piezo1 activate VE-
cadherin phosphorylation and thereby disrupt AJs?” In Aim 1, we will determine the role of microvessel
pressure in activating the mechanosensor channel Piezo1 in lung ECs and Piezo1’s role in regulating
endothelial permeability and lung fluid balance. We will determine whether Src dependent phosphorylation
of Piezo1 is required for Piezo1 activated Ca2+ signaling in ECs and whether this thereby mediates increased
endothelial permeability. In Aim 2, we will determine the role of Piezo1 signaling in mediating disassembly
of AJs through phosphorylation of VE-cadherin, and in increasing endothelial permeability. Here, we will
identify the signaling pathway downstream of Piezo1 activation that induces phosphorylation of VE-cadherin and
VE-cadherin endocytosis and thus disassemble the AJs. In Aim 3, we will determine the role of Piezo1 in
mediating lung vascular hyper-permeability (“stress failure”) and edema associated with left heart failure
(LHF). These studies will address the pathophysiological relevance of Piezo1 in the mechanism of pulmonary
edema resulting from LHF-induced increases in lung microvessel pressure. The above studies will be essential
for understanding the role of Piezo1 in increasing lung microvessel permeability, with the goal of identifying new
therapeutic targets for high pressure-induced pulmonary edema."

 The IEEE Medical Imaging Conference (MIC) is the leading international scientific meeting
bringing together a broad community interested in the physics, engineering, and mathematical
aspects of medical imaging, with particular emphasis on nuclear medicine and multi-modal
systems. The MIC runs in conjunction with the IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium (NSS) and the
Workshop on Room Temperature Semiconductor X-ray and Gamma-ray Detectors (RTSD).
 The purpose of the MIC is to disseminate and foster new research in physics and bio-
engineering methods in medical imaging. While the traditional topics of primary interest are
related to nuclear medicine techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) and single
photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT), increasing space will also be given to
recently evolving imaging modalities such as X-ray, CT, optical, MR, with particular emphasis on
their multi-modal combination with nuclear medical imaging. Lately, there has also been additional
interest in employing deep learning and AI to enhance the field of medical imaging. The
conference provides a well-established forum for scientific exchange and dialogue between
researchers in academia, industry, and government, as well as public education. The large
spectrum of educational refresher sessions and short courses reflects its special emphasis on
young generations. One of the primary objectives of the conference is the education of young
investigators. Therefore, this NIH R13 proposal seeks $10,000 in funding for each of the next
three years to provide 50 trainee grants of $200 each to partially cover the costs of MIC
conference registration, housing, or short course fees for graduate students and postdoctoral
fellows.
 We anticipate that the main impact of this grant program will be to increase the attendance
of students and postdocs at the 2023 through 2025 meetings, especially those typically
underrepresented, and to support their participation in educational activities. It is important to
bring young generations, especially women, minorities, and those with disabilities, into the
medical imaging field, where they could become leading players in the coming years. They will
attend plenary and oral presentations given by many world leaders in the nuclear medical imaging
instrumentation, image processing, and quantitative analysis fields. Moreover, they will be given
the unique opportunity of direct personal interaction through short courses and dedicated poster
presentations. Their work will be exposed to the other participants for critical evaluation,
constructive suggestions, and dissemination. Furthermore, many of these trainees will likely
continue in this field, thereby contributing to advancing technology with high societal relevance
as it is being increasingly used in the clinical management of disease and therapeutic
interventions."
11046029,"Project Summary
All eukaryotes use phosphorylation-based signaling networks, composed of protein kinases and
phosphatases, to regulate cellular processes. While global information about kinase signaling has
exploded, knowledge of phosphatases has lagged behind. The lack of systematic, unbiased approaches
to analyze phosphatase signaling leaves a major gap in our understanding of cellular regulatory
networks. For >25 years, my research on calcineurin, the conserved Ca2+/calmodulin-regulated
phosphatase, in S. cerevisiae and humans has directly addressed this issue. Calcineurin is ubiquitously
expressed and plays critical regulatory roles in the cardiovascular, nervous and immune systems (1);
however, only ~70 proteins are currently established as calcineurin substrates (2). Calcineurin
dephosphorylates the Nuclear Factor of Activated T-cells (NFAT) transcription factors to activate the
adaptive immune response (3), and calcineurin inhibitors, FK506 and cyclosporin A, are commonly
prescribed as immunosuppressants (4). However, these drugs cause unwanted effects, including
hypertension, diabetes, and seizures by inhibiting calcineurin in non-immune tissues (5), highlighting the
need to map human calcineurin signaling pathways systematically. My work elucidates calcineurin
signaling through novel approaches based on the discovery of short linear motifs (SLiMs): short
degenerate peptide sequences found within regions of intrinsic disorder that determine specific, low-
affinity interactions that are essential for signaling (6). Using experimental and in silico SLiM-based
methods, we recently defined the human calcineurin signaling network (2). This work uncovered
conserved regulation of nuclear pore complexes by calcineurin and showed unexpected calcineurin
proximity to centrosomes (2). Future efforts will elucidate Ca2+ and calcineurin signaling at these
compartments using a combination of methods that include phosphoproteomics and proximity labeling
with faster-labeling biotin ligases (miniTurbo (33), Split TurboID). Fluorescent sensors will be used to
probe Ca2+ signals at these locations in vivo. Calcineurin functions at membranes will be analyzed by
focusing on CNb1, a little-studied isoform with distinct localization and regulation conferred by its unique,
lipidated C-terminal sequences (10). Regulation of CNb1 activity via dynamic palmitoylation will be
examined, and CNb1-specific signaling pathways, including regulation of PI4P synthesis, will be
established to achieve a comprehensive and mechanistic understanding of this enzyme. Finally, the
novel technology, MRBLE-PEP (Microspheres Ratiometric Barcode Lanthenide Encoding coupled to
PEPtides) (11), will be developed for quantitative analysis and discovery of SLiMs. Overall this research

To date, the studies on tissue fluidity are limited to the epithelial-tissue paradigm, while a variety of tissue
migration and morphogenesis involves cells in the partial epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (pEMT) state,
including abnormal early development, tissue regeneration, and cancer growth. The long-term objective of
the project is to unravel how to control tissue fluidity and flows with cells pocessing the hybrid
epithelial/mesenchymal phenotype along the pEMT spectrum.
Different from epithelial tissues, pEMT cell monolayers present a unique spatial distribution of
force-bearing actin network, and it is not clear how tissue flow and fluidity is facilitated spatiotemporally in
the pEMT tissue. The project aims to investigate the fluidity patterning in the partial EMT state at the
large-scale tissue level and cell-cell aggregate level.
To achieve the goal, we will develop a multiscale theory-experiment framework to elucidate the cell-cell
intercalation and large-scale kinematics regulation in the in vitro tissue monolayer induced by a profound
wounds. To investigate the distinction of the partial EMT state to the epithelial state in the fluidity control,
we will study cell lines with different EMT potential under different treatment conditions that change their
extent of partial EMT state and protocols known to perturb cell intercalations and tissue flow. To describe
the large-scale tissue flow, we will leverage the morphoelasticity theory and develop novel numerical
methods which solve the coupled system of nonlinear elliptic and time-evolution equations by constrained
nonlinear optimizations. To describe the cell-cell intercalations among the tissue flow, we will hybrid the
morphoelasticity theory with cell-cell junctional kinematics and mechanics, and solve the multiscale system
as a nonlinear optimzation problem.

 Bacteria communicate with their environment using a chemical language consisting of
secreted small molecules, also referred to as natural products or secondary metabolites. Nowhere
is this communication more relevant to human health than in the microbiome where hordes of
beneficial microbes and pathogens `talk' and compete amidst a cacophony of small molecule
exchanges. Corynebacteria are commensal residents of the skin and upper respiratory tract and
have recently emerged as opportunistic, multidrug-resistant pathogens. However, virtually
nothing is known about their secondary metabolomes and, thus, how they compete with other
microbes and interact with host cells. In the current application, we propose to characterize the
secondary metabolomes of three corynebacterial strains using high-throughput elicitor screening
(HiTES), a state-of-the-art chemical biology and natural product discovery approach that identifies
the small molecule products of silent or sparingly expressed biosynthetic genes. Specifically, we
plan to uncover the secondary metabolites that the three Corynebacteria use to compete with one
another in intra-genus chemical warfare, to antagonize Staphylococcus aureus in inter-genus
competition, and to modulate cytokine production by host cells in inter-kingdom associations.
Together, the results of this proposal will elucidate intra-genus, inter-genus and inter-kingdom
interactions by important and underexplored bacteria in the body. The feasibility for the proposed
exploratory grant is provided by recent application of the HiTES approach to streptococcal
bacteria in the microbiome. The proposed studies can therefore be completed in the two-year
period and thus shine light on the lifestyles of important microbiome members while at the same
time contributing important knowledge that can be used to develop therapies against
corynebacterial infections."

Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening reduces lung cancer deaths. However, LDCT screening
rates are extremely low in the U.S., particularly among populations experiencing health disparities, such as
Black and low-income Americans. Critics argue that lung cancer screening guidelines do not adequately
identify those who would benefit most from screening. In 2021, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force
(USPSTF) updated its guidelines to respond to these critiques and widen their eligibility criteria. Currently, the
USPSTF recommends LDCT annually for individuals between the ages of 50 and 80 years with at least a 20
pack-year history of smoking, and who currently smoke or have quit smoking within the past 15 years. The
American Cancer Society (ACS) expanded their LDCT screening guidelines in November 2023 to similarly
widen their eligibility criteria. The ACS and USPSTF guidelines base screening eligibility on age and smoking
history. Yet, screening strategies that use risk prediction models may more equitably identify individuals at high
lung cancer risk because they consider more factors (e.g., family cancer history). Some programs are therefore
launching efforts to assess lung cancer risk among all age-eligible individuals who have ever smoked using the
PLCOm2012 risk prediction model. Prior studies suggest USPSTF guidelines and risk prediction models are cost-
effective, but it is unclear whether health benefits are equitably distributed across subpopulations. Cost-
effectiveness analysis (CEA) often guides policy decisions but traditionally does not consider equity. Current
CEAs of lung cancer screening focus on overall health benefits without considering the distribution of benefits
across groups. Many analyses also assume ideal yet unrealistic conditions (e.g., universal screening uptake).
This project will use a novel Distributional Cost-Effectiveness Analyses (DCEA) framework, which adds an
equity dimension to standard CEA, to address limitations of previous work. The study will evaluate the equity
impact and cost-effectiveness of three real-world lung cancer screening strategies: the USPSTF guidelines, the
ACS guidelines, and an approach based on the PLCOm2012 risk prediction model. The study will consider equity
by explicitly modeling disparities in screening eligibility and uptake rates across different subpopulations
experiencing health disparities (e.g., Black Americans). The proposal has three aims. Aim 1 will assess the
equity impact and cost-effectiveness of the three lung cancer screening strategies using DCEA. Aim 2 will
evaluate trade-offs between reducing inequity and maximizing cost-effectiveness in these screening programs.
Aim 3 will create an analytical tool for decision-makers to compare the impact of various interventions on lung
cancer screening uptake, especially among historically disadvantaged groups. Overall, this project will provide
data-driven insights and tools to assist in the development of equitable and efficient lung cancer screening
programs, with a focus on improving access and uptake among populations experiencing health disparities."
11038999,"Project Summary/Abstract
An unprecedented rise in opioid overdose and opioid use disorder (OUD) has become a public health crisis in
the US. In response, health systems, payers, and policy makers have developed or adopted measures and
programs to target individuals at high-risk for overdose or OUD. However, significant gaps exist in the current
approaches to identify individuals at high-risk for overdose or OUD. First, the definition of ‘high-risk’ currently
used by payers and health systems varies widely (ranging from high opioid dose to the number of pharmacies
or prescribers a patient has visited). Second, little is known about how accurately these measures truly identify
patients with overdose or OUD, and there is some evidence showing they perform poorly, missing 70% to 90%
of individuals with an actual OUD diagnosis or overdose. Third, our NIDA-funded work (R01DA044985) using
national Medicare and Pennsylvania Medicaid claims data has shown that machine-learning algorithms can
achieve better performance for risk prediction for opioid overdose and OUD. Thus, the immediate next step is to
expand our algorithms to other data sources (e.g., electronic health records [EHR]), as well as to apply state-of-
the-art longitudinal neural networks and natural language processing (NLP) to further improve prediction
accuracy. In addition, we aim to translate these risk scores into a clinical decision tool to be used by health care
systems to automatically analyze and visualize the relevant information regarding risk prediction and stratification
for opioid overdose or OUD, using either claims data, EHR data, or both in real time.
Leveraging our NIDA-funded work on developing machine-learning algorithms to predict opioid overdose and
OUD, we propose to “develop and evaluate a machine-learning opioid prediction & risk-stratification e-
platform (DEMONSTRATE)” that can be used by health care systems to identify patients at high risk for
opioid overdose and OUD. We have 3 specific aims. Aim 1 will refine and validate prediction algorithms to
identify patients at risk for opioid overdose/OUD using 3 different datasets (i.e., 2011-2020 Florida all-payer EHR,
Florida Medicaid claims, and Florida Medicaid claims linked with EHR data) from the OneFlorida Clinical
Research Consortium. We will expand our current algorithms by applying state-of-the-art methods (e.g., NLP) to
improve prediction. In Aim 2, we will design and prototype a DEMONSTRATE clinical decision support tool to
incorporate the best prediction algorithms to provide automatic warnings to primary care providers of patients at
high risk of overdose/OUD. An iterative user-centered design approach will be used to enhance
DEMONSTRATE’s functionality and usability. In Aim 3, we will integrate DEMONSTRATE into the University of
Florida Health’s EHR system, and deploy and pilot test DEMONSTRATE in three primary care clinics. We will
assess DEMONSTRATE’s usability, acceptability, and feasibility. Our proposed research is highly innovative in
its expansion, translation, and application of a promising NIDA-funded machine-learning opioid prediction and
risk stratification tool into a software platform to better inform clinical practice for improving safety of opioid use."
11043225,"The goal of this application is to investigate the important role of intestinal microbial homeostasis in ALS,
meanwhile investigating a novel approach that can potentially treat ALS by restoring host-microbe relationships
and combining with FDA approved drugs. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neuromuscular disease
characterized by progressive death of motor neurons and muscle atrophy. Most patients die within 5 years
after the disease onset. Currently, treatment with Riluzole and Radicava only extends patient life span for a few
months. Therefore, there are significant needs to develop novel treatments for ALS and improving the life
quality of ALS patients. Emerging evidence has demonstrated that microbiome and intestinal homeostasis
plays essential roles in neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. However,
little is known about the intestinal microbiome in patients with ALS. Our lab is the first to discover the link
between intestinal homeostasis and the disease progression in an ALS mouse model G93A. Our study in
human ALS further reveals the dysbiosis and intestinal inflammation. ALS mice had damaged intestinal
structure and increased intestinal permeability (leaky gut). Remarkably, restoring the intestinal homeostasis by
feeding the ALS model mice with a bacterial product butyrate significantly delayed the disease onset and
prolonged the life span of ALS mice. We hypothesize that targeting gut microbiome and combining with FDA
approved drugs to improve the intestinal barrier function and restore microbiome, thus slowing disease
progression of ALS. The studies are designed to rigorously examine the hypotheses and address two main
objectives. Aim 1 is to determine the mechanisms that contribute to dysbiosis and barrier dysfunction in ALS.
We will define the mechanism for abnormal epithelial junction structure and dysbiosis (e.g. loss of butyrate-
producing bacteria) in ALS mice. We will investigate roles of butyrate and butyrate-producing bacteria, using
novel molecular tools, enteroid cultures, and transgenic animal models (SOD1G93 mice and a novel gut-specific
overexpression of SOD1G93 model). We will determine mechanisms underlying the benefits of bacterial product
butyrate on intestinal permeability and neuroprotection. Aim 2 is to conduct proof-of-principle studies with
restoring gut microbiome and intestinal barrier for preserving neuromuscular function in ALS. ALS mice at
different stages of ALS will be treated with beneficial bacteria (probiotics that promote butyrate production) or
combining with FDA drugs (Riluzole or Radicava). ALS mice will have fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT)
using health wild-type mice as donors. Physiological and molecular biological assessments of intestinal
integrity, microbiome, and neuromuscular performance will be used to evaluate the therapeutic effects.
Histopathology and biochemical evaluations will be used to determine changes at the cellular level of intestinal
and neuromuscular function at different stages of ALS. We will optimize the efficacy of restoring intestinal
microbiome combining with FDA drugs in slowing ALS progression using different ALS mouse models
(SOD1G93A and TDP43). Veterans are twice as likely to be diagnosed with ALS as the general population.
Military veterans, regardless of the branch of service, the era in which they served, or whether they served
during a time of peace or war, are at a greater risk of dying from ALS than if they had not served in the military.
Our study is significant because of the health burden of ALS in VA population and the novel role of the
microbiome on neuromuscular function in health and disease, especially in Veterans' care. Innovation of this
project lies in its: (a) therapeutic potential for ALS, (b) conceptual frame-work to discover early changes
and dysbiosis and the gut barrier effects before onset of ALS, and (c) state-of–the-art experimental models
that allow us to understand novel mechanisms underlying the beneficial effect of probiotics and/or bacterial
products that improve the motor neuron function. It has significant translational implications for developing new
therapeutic strategies for combating this devastating disease and improving the health of veterans."

1 in 500 newborns suffers from genetic hearing loss (HL), and there are no FDA-approved drugs or biological treatments
for any type of HL. Genome editing that disrupts or repairs DNA mutations or modulates RNA levels is being developed
into new therapies for many diseases. Despite the unprecedented progress, the translation of genome editing into therapy
in humans has been challenging due to the obstacles in delivery, safety, and efficacy. This is particularly relevant for in
vivo editing therapy due to the added complexity, including damped editing efficiency, inefficiency in reaching the target
cells, and the lack of evidence of translatability from animal (mouse) into humans. In this proposal, we will develop first-
in-class CRISPR-Cas-based therapeutics for genetic hearing loss by conducting IND-enabling studies of AAV2-mediated
delivery of SaCas9-KKH/gRNA to target two dominant genetic hearing loss, DFNA41 due to a P2RX2 mutation and
DFNA2 due to a KCNQ4 mutation. This project will be conducted by a consortium of five core teams with unique and
complementary expertise and experience in gene and editing treatments for genetic hearing loss, from animal models to
human trials, editing technology, and regulatory processes. We have recently conducted the first successful gene therapy
of OTOF clinical trial by dual adeno-associated virus (AAV) that leads to hearing restoration in children with congenital
genetic hearing loss DFNB9, which included a safety study of AAV in non-human primates (NHPs) and the development
of a minimally invasive surgical procedure for AAV inner ear delivery in humans. We have further developed a large
animal pig model of dominant genetic hearing loss DFNA36 by inserting a mutation into the TMC1 gene and successfully
rescued hearing in the pig model by local AAV delivery of editing complex, demonstrating the cross-species
translatability of editing therapy for genetic hearing loss. For the current proposal, we have obtained the therapeutic
benefit of hearing rescue results by AAV2 delivery of SaCas9-KKH/gRNA to treat DFNA41 and DFNA2 mouse models,
which lays the foundation of an IND-enabling study. Leveraging our unparalleled expertise and experience in human
genetic hearing loss, including efficacious editing treatment in mouse and pig models, AAV safety study in NHP, and the
first successful human gene therapy clinical trial, we will conduct the following studies: 1). Establish off-target editing
profiles in human cells and human inner ear tissues; 2). Efficacy study by escalating doses of AAV2 in DFNA41 and
DFNA2 mouse models; 3). Biodistribution and toxicity study in WT mice by an escalating dose of AAV2; 4).
Biodistribution and toxicity study of GLP grade AAV2 in NHP; 5). Patient natural history study, and 6). Regulatory
Interactions & IND completion. We have assembled a team of experts in each area with a project manager to execute the
plan, develop a streamlined regulatory path for two types of DFNA deafness, and disseminate this regulatory information
to the scientific community. Successful completion of the IND-enabling studies makes our approach applicable to over 20
dominant genetic hearing loss due to hair cell mutations."

 The 70-kilodalton heat shock protein (HSP70) family, universally conserved across prokaryotic and
eukaryotic organisms, serves as essential molecular chaperones for maintaining protein homeostasis. They are
central to the pathology of various diseases, including cancer, infectious diseases, neurodegeneration, and
cardiovascular disorders. Beyond their established intracellular roles, HSP70 proteins also manifest in the
extracellular space, significantly influencing cancer biology by modulating immune responses and facilitating
metastasis. This positions them as vital biomarkers for deciphering and potentially targeting the mechanisms
underlying cancer pathology. The critical involvement of HSP70 in such diverse human pathologies underscores
the potential of therapeutic strategies to modulate HSP70 pathways. Delving into the complex structure-function
relationship of HSP70 is essential for developing novel therapeutic interventions capable of addressing various
pathologies. This project aims to elucidate the intricate roles of the cytosolic HSP70, with a particular emphasis
on its underexplored structural attributes and their ramifications for cellular operations and disease pathogenesis.
The long-term objectives include a deeper understanding of HSP70’s role in maintaining cellular integrity and
stress response, which is crucial for developing innovative therapeutic interventions for various diseases.
Specifically, the research will concentrate on HSP70’s lectin-like capacity to bind O-GlcNAcylated proteins, its
ability to bind calcium/calmodulin, and its extracellular functions. These functionalities are hypothesized to be
pivotal in modulating cellular thermoresistance and stress responses and potentially influencing the onset and
progression of various diseases. The chosen model system for this investigation is Arabidopsis cytosolic HSP70
(AtHSP70), selected for its significant homology to human HSP70 isoforms and its established role in conferring
heat stress resilience in plants. This model provides a robust framework for dissecting the conserved
mechanisms of HSP70 function relevant to human health, thus directly aligning with the mission of improving the
understanding and treatment of human diseases. To achieve these aims, the project will employ cutting-edge
techniques such as proximity labeling with TurboID to identify novel protein interactions in vivo and lectin weak
affinity chromatography to characterize the interaction between HSP70 and glycosylated proteins. Through a
detailed examination of these interactions, the project seeks to expand the current understanding of HSP70’s
intracellular and extracellular functions and uncover potential therapeutic targets within the HSP70 pathway. By
revealing how alterations in HSP70’s interactions with carbohydrates and Ca2+/CaM can influence disease
mechanisms, the research aims to open new avenues for developing therapies that modulate these pathways.
In essence, this project embodies a strategic approach to bridging fundamental biological research with potential
clinical applications, thereby underscoring its relevance to the overarching goal of advancing human health by
targeting the molecular bases of disease."
11043830,"The Coats plus syndrome is a rare and life-threatening genetic disorder characterized by multi-system
developmental defects that lead to bilateral exudative retinopathy, retinal telangiectasias, growth retardation,
intracranial calcifications, bone abnormalities, gastrointestinal vascular ectasias, and common early-aging
pathological features. Like many other developmental disorders, Coats plus is caused by defects in genes
involved in maintaining global genome integrity. Specifically, it is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the
human CTC1/STN1/TEN1 (CST) complex, which is a trimeric complex that preferentially binds to G-rich ssDNA
or ss-ds DNA junctions and is critical for preventing genome instabilities arising from replication perturbation. We
hope to aid in better understanding of disease development and designing of effective therapeutic strategies by
investigating the mechanisms governing genome stability under replication stress. In response to fork stalling,
signaling cascades activate multiple pathways including fork reversal, translesion synthesis, repriming
downstream of stalled sites, and dormant origin firing to rescue stalled replication. Activities of these pathways
need to be tightly regulated to ensure replication fidelity. The objectives of this proposal is to delineate a novel
signaling pathway in response to replication stress, elucidate how it regulates protein interplays and recruitment
at stalled forks, and understand the mechanism regulating the repriming pathway. In Aim 1, we hypothesize that
a calcium-dependent signaling pathway phosphorylates STN1 to activate CST at stalled forks to protect the
stability of stalled forks. We will elucidate this new signaling pathway and determine how this pathway
antagonizes unscheduled nascent strand DNA degradation and regulates fork protection. In Aim 2, we will
investigate how this signaling pathway regulates the interplay of single-strand DNA binding proteins at forks and
other fork binding proteins. In Aim 3, we will investigate the mechanism for restricting excessive repriming to
prevent ssDNA gap formation and genome instability. We will combine highly sensitive cell-based analyses,
single-molecule and powerful biochemical assays to accomplish the goals of the proposed research. We expect
that our efforts will identify new factors and pathways regulating the rescue of stalled replication and the
preservation of genome stability."

This application is to expand the Administrative Core of the Center for AIDS Research at Emory University
(Emory CFAR) to include the Adelante Research Capacity Program. Since first funding in 1997, the Emory
CFAR has risen to preeminence in the HIV research community, through the development and support of its
members. Emory CFAR Members possess broad expertise representing the full scientific spectrum needed to
accelerate HIV science from the bench to the bedside to the communities we serve. Emory CFAR
organizes this expertise into five research focus areas: Basic Research, Pre-Clinical Research, Clinical
Research, Prevention Science, and Public Health. These focus areas are served by an Administrative Core, a
Developmental Core, five Science Cores (Biostatistics and Bioinformatics; Clinical Research; Prevention and
Implementation Sciences; Systems Immunology; and Virology and Molecular Biomarkers); and two Scientific
Working Groups (SWGs) - Health Equity and Next Generation Therapeutics.
The Emory CFAR is uniquely poised—geographically and scientifically—to achieve our mission. We are
located at the epicenter of four high burden counties as defined by Phase I of the Ending the HIV Epidemic
Initiative. These metro-Atlanta counties are home to almost 3.5M persons (54% African American; 5.2%
Hispanic/Latinx), representing one-third of Georgia's population. Our location allows CFAR Members to apply
necessary scientific tools to achieve EHE goals and advance NIH research priorities. Given the high burden of
HIV in our geographical region, coupled with clear inequities in access to healthcare in the communities we
serve, the Emory CFAR is committed to working toward equity in all aspects of research, faculty
development, and community engagement. We will intentionally seek to recruit and develop a cadre of
URM investigators in collaboration with our colleagues at Morehouse School of Medicine, and we will continue
to elevate the role of the CFAR Community Liaison Council, expanding their influence within the CFAR to
guide best practice for the dissemination of HIV research findings and together, we will strive to build
community trust in research through the intentional inclusion of key stakeholders at all stages of the research
pipeline. The Emory CFAR proposes the following Specific Aims:
 Aim 1. Advance groundbreaking HIV research across the entire scientific spectrum of NIH-defined
 priority research areas to end the epidemic for all and to promote health equity.
 Aim 2. Cultivate cutting-edge tools and services to support transdisciplinary research teams.
 Aim 3. Develop and train the next generation of outstanding and diverse HIV investigators.
 Aim 4. Elevate multidirectional community stakeholder engagement to improve the well-being of people
 living with and at risk for HIV across their lifespan."

treatments, including factor VIII (FVIII) replacement and recent novel therapeutics, focus primarily on joint
health. In spite of advancements in treatment options, disabilities remain. People with hemophilia suffer from
increased rates of mental health disorders compared to age and sex matched controls (45% vs. 18.5%). While
significant progress has been made in prevention and treatment of hemophilia-related joint and muscle disease
with current standards of care, there is a paucity of research in hemophilia A to understand, treat, or prevent
brain disease. The long-term goal is to find diagnostic and treatment approaches that address the mechanism
and structure of neurologic disease in hemophilia A. The objective of this proposal is to examine the role of
FVIII deficiency on neurologic function and structure. The central hypothesis is that cerebral microbleeds and
neuroinflammation lead to changes in brain structure, causing behavioral changes in hemophilia A mice. The
rationale underlying this proposal is that completion will identify mechanisms causing poor neurologic
outcomes in hemophilia A. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: Aim 1)
Examine cerebral microbleeds and neuroanatomy phenotypes in hemophilia A mice. Aim 2) Investigate glial
activation and neuroinflammation in hemophilia A mice. Aim 3) Identify the role of FVIII replacement in
neuropsychiatric behavioral phenotypes in hemophilia A mice. We will pursue these aims using innovative
quantitative neuroimaging and gene transfer techniques to evaluate brain structure and function in hemophilia
animal model over time. The proposed research is significant because we will gain insights into the
neuroanatomic changes and neuroinflammatory pathways impacted in a model of FVIII deficiency. The
expected outcome of this work is that lack of FVIII will result in significant neurologic abnormalities. The results
will have an important positive impact because they will establish a better understanding of the developing
brain structure and function in FVIII deficiency, and long-term will improve cognitive, psychiatric, and quality of
life outcomes for people with hemophilia A."

Despite modern efforts to eradicate malaria, the disease continues to threaten the lives of over half the world's
population. The urgency to uncover novel drug targets in the blood and liver stages of Plasmodium parasites,
the causative agents of malaria, is exacerbated by strains resistant to frontline antimalarials. To address this
need, a better understanding of pathogen biology is imperative, particularly relating to essential, druggable
proteins. The Plasmodium falciparum heat shock proteins 90 and 70-1 (PfHsp90 and PfHsp70-1) are molecular
chaperones critical to multiple stages of the parasite's lifecycle. These proteins have N-terminal nucleotide
binding domains (NBD) that hydrolyze ATP and C-terminal domains that are critical for protein binding and
functional dimer formation. We previously identified several molecules that bind to the PfHsp90 NBD that potently
inhibit Plasmodium, but the role of the C-terminus for protein function has not been fully explored. We also
discovered that the PfHsp70-1 C-terminus has a critical role in lipid signaling under heat stress, but we lacked
chemical probes to resolve the function of the NBD in this process. Thus, we need domain-specific small
molecule probes to unravel the role of these protein domains in Plasmodium proteostasis and signaling. Our
goal is to understand mechanisms that support Plasmodium protein homeostasis and signaling by investigating
domain-specific PfHsp90 and PfHsp70-1 functions and to uncover their interactomes. In Aim 1, we plan to
develop domain-specific chemical probes that target PfHsp90 and PfHsp70-1. Candidates discovered through
target-based screening will be assessed for their affinity with biochemical methods and the ligand binding site
will be established with the mass spectrometry approach stability of proteins from rates of oxidation (SPROX).
Our preliminary efforts to date have yielded putative novel N-terminal and C-terminal binders for both chaperones
that we will optimize and employ in biological studies. In Aim 2, we will investigate the PfHsp90 and PfHsp70-1
interactomes using our chemical probes and genetic tools, respectively, in thermal proteome profiling and limited
proteolysis strategies. Prioritized chaperone interactors will be validated with biochemical methods. In Aim 3, we
will leverage our PfHsp90 and PfHsp70-1 chemical probes to link chaperone domains to the transcriptional stress
response, global protein regulation, and digestive vacuole stability in parasites. We will use RNA-sequencing to
assess the transcriptome and develop bioorthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging (BONCAn to label and
track nascent proteins in Plasmodium after chemical probe addition. Digestive vacuole stabilization assays will
be completed after chaperone inhibition using live-cell microscopy. Together, this work will identify and
characterize parasitic molecular networks involving PfHsp90 and PfHsp70-1 to gain insight into their biological
function. Our chemical biology approach offers a route to complete fundamental biological studies throughout

This project seeks to advance equity in clinical trials by identifying and addressing barriers to clinical trial
participation experienced by urban American Indians at a clinical research site embedded within an urban
indian health clinic. Although there are ongoing efforts to make clinical trials more representative of the
population, American Indians have the lowest representation of race/ethnic groups in the United States.
Innovative, novel approaches are needed to address the barriers to participating in clinical research. The
project will engage urban American Indians and will be influenced by Indigenous cultural values of
respect, relationship, responsibility, reciprocity and redistribution. The goal of this exploratory research
project will be to identify barriers to participation in clinical trials of urban American Indians and to identify
solutions to address those barriers through a trusted relationship with a community research worker. The
project will first involve creating a survey to explore barriers to clinical trial participation. Patients who self-
identify as American Indian will be asked if they are willing to participate in the study, provide informed
consent and take the survey. Results from the survey will be analyzed to determine themes and solutions
to these barriers. A main component of this program is the creation of a Community Research Worker
(CRW) role, similar to a Community Health Worker (CHW) or Community Health Representative (CHR).
A CHW is a frontline public health worker who is a trusted member and has an unusually close
understanding of the community served. This trusting relationship enables the worker to serve as a liaison
between health/social services and the community to facilitate access to services and improve the quality
and cultural competence of service delivery. The difference with a CRW is they would serve as a liaison
between clinical trial services and the community to address barriers to clinical trial participation. A
specialized training curriculum for the CRW will be created including, but not limited to topics such as:
American Indian cultural competency, cultural intelligence, unconscious bias, and how to find resources to
address Social Determinants of Health (SDoH). Once the training program has been created, the CRW
will go through this training. Then the CRW will approach patients who self-identify as American Indian,
ask them to be part of the research study, obtain informed consent, and have them take the barrier to
clinical trial participation survey. The CRW will build a trusting relationship with patients by having a
discussion to help determine what SDoH the patient is facing. Patients will then be asked to complete a
post survey to determine if they are more likely to consider enrolling in a clinical trial. The impact of CRW
engagement on improving willingness to consider clinical trial participation will be evaluated with the intent
to determine if further research on the benefits of a CRW is warranted."

The human gut microbiome harbors microbes with the capacity to cause infection or drive pathogenic
inflammation. Immune status often determines risk for microbiome-associated disease, which is typically
attributed to immune impacts on microbial community composition. But pathogenic or commensal lifestyles can
also be dynamically regulated within individual microbes, and there is far less understood about immune
impacts on microbial inherent pathogenic potential. Candida albicans is a morphologically and transcriptionally
dynamic commensal fungus that can cause life-threatening infections and exacerbate pathogenic
inflammation. The ability for C. albicans to cause disease depends on its phenotypic state. Of particular
importance is the formation of hyphae, which are elongated cells specialized for adherence and invasion, and
promote disease in both infection and inflammatory settings. Immune status is crucial for determining risk for
C. albicans-associated disease and both immune deficiencies and active inflammation are linked to C. albicans
pathogenesis. However, the role of immune environment on in vivo C. albicans pathogenic potential is not well
understood. Here, I will investigate the impact of two human relevant immune environments on C. albicans
pathogenic potential. Project 1 will focus on IgA regulation of C. albicans biology. Anti-C. albicans IgA
antibodies are found in the gut of most people, and I previously found that C. albicans hyphae and associated
effectors are heavily targeted by IgA during colonization. In mouse models, IgA targeting is associated with
reduced hyphae and reduced capacity to exacerbate colitis. Here, I will interrogate mechanisms by which IgA
regulates C. albicans biology in vivo using a mouse colonization model that permits investigation of immediate
regulatory impacts of IgA targeting on C. albicans biology. Using this model, I will interrogate IgA impacts on C.
albicans morphology and gene expression, which will include single cell transcriptional profiling to investigate
gene expression in individual IgA-targeted cells. The goal of Project 2 is to define the impacts of inflammation
on C. albicans pathogenic potential. Evidence from human IBD studies and mouse models of colitis suggest
that this fungus exploits inflammation to bloom and perpetuate disease. Here, I will use a mouse model of
intestinal colitis to define inflammation-dependent impacts on C. albicans morphology and transcriptional
profile, with the goal of defining C. albicans pathways responsible for disease exacerbation. This proposal will
reveal fundamental mechanisms by which immune environment regulates C. albicans biology and advance our
understanding of how C. albicans becomes pathogenic in certain people. Broadly, these efforts will provide a
foundation for our long-term goal of identifying targeted therapeutic strategies to prevent commensal C.
albicans reservoirs from causing disease."

Initial evidence suggests that interventions that target neurocircuitry, such as real-time fMRI
neurofeedback (rt-fMRI-NF) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), have promise for AUD
treatment; however, there remains a critical need to leverage rt-fMRI-NF and rTMS neuromodulation
techniques towards a sustained decrease in problem drinking and related antisocial / aggressive
behaviors. Therefore, the overall objective for this R00 project is to identify a neuroscientific intervention
that works to decrease alcohol drinking and antisocial behavior in individuals with AUD. The central
hypothesis is that a rt-fMRI-NF training/ TMS intervention will result in sustained reduction of alcohol
drinking and negative social behaviors. Preliminary data from the K99 portion of the study have shown
that learned control of neural response during rt-fMRI-NF training corresponds to less feelings of craving
after the session, supporting transfer effects of the intervention . Moreover, preliminary evidence suggests
that alcohol attention bias may contribute to the link between alcohol use and antisocial behaviors. Thus,
the R00 portion has the following two specific aims: 1) Develop a TMS protocol that contributes to a
reduction in alcohol craving and alcohol attention bias; and 2) Evaluate the comparative efficacy of
rt-fMRI-NF, TMS, and treatment as usual in reducing drinking and alcohol-related negative social
behaviors. The first study will be a crossover TMS study in which studies will receive rTMS to the right
frontal eye field (FEF), an area involved in attention switching. All subjects will receive inhibitory and
excitatory TMS in separate sessions and will complete MRI scans pre- and post- TMS. We expect to
demonstrate a) impairing attention switching in healthy controls (n = 20) leads to neural patterns
consistent with attention bias in AUD; and b) improving attention switching through TMS attenuates
attention bias in individuals with AUD (n = 20). The second study will follow a RCT design. At each of four
weekly treatment session, individuals seeking treatment for AUD (n = 90) will receive an intervention
consisting of active/sham rt-fMRI-N F/TMS or a treatment as usual ""check in"". Subjects will then be
followed monthly for a year to assess alcohol use, craving, and related negative behaviors. Subjects will
also return for 6 and 12 month MRI follow-ups to assess longitudinal neural changes. We hypothesize that

Suicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents in the US, with rates of suicidal ideation (SI) and behavior
continuing to increase in recent years. Given the simultaneous increase in social media use (SMU), there is
public concern about the relationship between SMU and SI. Methodological limitations in prior research limit our
understanding of this relationship and the development of empirically-based recommendations for best practices
with SMU. Most studies: 1) only focus on SMU patterns (duration/frequency), 2) assess SMU via self-report
methods at a single timepoint, 3) use cross-sectional designs limiting directionality, and 4) do not consider
influences of other media or in-person social experiences. We also do not yet understand the potential
mechanisms linking SMU and SI. This makes it challenging to identify the nuanced, objective, temporal, and
unique relation between SMU and SI, or potential mechanisms. The proposed study will address these limitations
using rigorous, innovative, and youth-centered approaches, including ongoing consultation of the proposed study
with our youth advisory board. We will use intensive monitoring approaches to examine the relationships
between three SMU domains in relation to SI among adolescents recently discharged from psychiatric
hospitalization for suicide-related risk. SMU patterns (duration/frequency) will be objectively captured using
smartphone sensing methods. Negative SMU (i.e., social rejection via social comparison, negative interactions),
positive SMU (i.e., social connection via social support, positive interactions), and SI will be assessed using
ecological momentary assessment (EMA). This approach allows us to examine directional and proximal relations
between SMU and SI (Aim 1), and to identify SMU’s unique effects compared to other screentime and in-person
social experiences. This study also will evaluate sleep disruption as a potential mechanism linking SMU and SI.
Sleep disruption (e.g., shorter duration, poorer quality) is a proximal risk factor for SI and modifiable target for
prevention. While SMU has been linked to sleep disruption, sleep disruption also may influence SMU patterns
and experiences to heighten risk for SI. This study will capture sleep using actigraphy and sleep diaries to
examine the bidirectional relationships between SMU (patterns, negative, positive) and sleep disruption (Aim
2a), and in risk for next-day SI (Aim 2b). Adolescents (N=85, 13-17 years) in the first 3 months after psychiatric
hospitalization will be recruited and participate in an intensive monitoring study over 28 days, leveraging the
infrastructure from an ongoing multi-site R01. Post-hospitalization is a high-risk period for suicide, and these
high-risk youth may be more affected by SMU, making this period critical for suicide prevention. Results from
this innovative, multi-method study will advance our understanding on relationships between SMU, sleep, and
SI among youth at high-risk for suicide. This study will yield high-impact findings to inform scalable and equitable
suicide prevention programs and evidence-based SMU guidelines to improve adolescent mental health."

The purpose of the proposed University of Chicago (UChicago) Center for Healthy Aging Behaviors and
Longitudinal InvestigationS (CHABLIS) is to promote a sustained research and infrastructure development
program that leverages longitudinal data, from both observational and interventional studies, to examine how
demographic and economic factors facilitate or suppress individual healthy aging behaviors (HABs) and, in turn
influence outcomes among older adults over the life course. Spanning five divisions and schools and
partnering with the National Opinion Research Center (NORC), CHABLIS will bring many areas of expertise
and multiple methodologies to bear on the demography and economics of aging. The central thesis of this
proposal is that CHABLIS connects schools, disciplines (e.g., economics, sociology, medicine), and people.
We aim to: 1) enhance and lead innovation in the demography and economics of aging; and 2) cultivate the
next generation of leaders in social science approaches to aging research with attention to demographic
methods and approaches. The Program Development Core focuses on providing research and career
development support to early-career faculty and supporting pilot projects that span the demography and
economics of aging in both medical and social science realms. Our External Innovative Network Core draws on
the infrastructure of the National Social Life, Health and Aging Project (NSHAP), and our local Comprehensive
Care Physician (CCP) Program, to create opportunities for exchange and research synergies between these
two different forms of data collection and research. The External Research Resources Support and
Dissemination Core is a joint effort with the Duke Center for Population Health and Aging (CPHA). Its goal is to
identify, design, conduct and assess innovations in data collection and measurement for use in current and
future data-focused studies of aging, and share those findings immediately. The emphasis in that Core, and
throughout our proposal, is that longitudinal data collection efforts are central to research on aging, whether
they be local (e.g., CCP) or national (e.g., NSHAP); data collection processes must be continually advanced to
ensure that these data are relevant and used. Our Administrative and Research Support Core lays out our
move, both physically and administratively, to the Center for Health and the Social Sciences (CHeSS). This
Core will manage all aspects of the enterprise and will conduct expanded evaluation activities. CHABLIS
enjoys the strengths of a productive and influential set of senior scholars who will effectively mentor its early-
career faculty members."
11046032,"Cognitive and Contextual Factors in Suicide Ideation Persistence in Adolescents. Deaths from suicide continue
to be a major public health concern, particularly among youth for whom suicide ranks as the second leading
cause of death. Recent suicide ideation is reported by almost 20% of high school students, and the majority of
those report persistent ideation of more than one year. If the factors that associate with persistent and remitting
suicide ideation can be identified, then resources can be directed to those most at risk, with a likely impact on
rates of suicide. Depression, hopelessness, and psychiatric diagnoses have been studied as risk factors for
over 50 years, yet they are neither sufficient, nor effective, for understanding suicide risk. It is important to
evaluate cognitive and contextual factors for suicide ideation, which are understudied, particularly for rural
youth. Cognitive factors that may relate to suicide ideation are defeat, entrapment, grit, and self-efficacy.
Contextual factors with potential to make an impact on suicide ideation are socio-economic status, access to
lethal means, social support, food and housing security, and access to health care. The parent grant
(2R15MH113045-02) aims to fill these knowledge gaps through a 12-month longitudinal study of 225 non-
clinical, rural adolescents between the ages of 14 and 18 who report a history of suicide ideation. The parent
grant proposes that cognitive and contextual factors will differentiate adolescents with and without suicide
ideation history in the baseline sample. It is further expected that the cognitive factors defeat and entrapment
will associate with persisting suicide ideation, and self-efficacy and grit will associate with remitting suicide
ideation at follow-ups. Lastly, it is expected that contextual factors will associate with persisting (low SES and
access to lethal means) vs. remitting (social support, food and housing security, access to health care) suicide
ideation at follow-ups. This diversity supplement will augment the parent grant by supporting a second-year
master’s student trainee who will examine how sexual and gender minority (SGM) status associates with these
factors and persistent suicide ideation. Adolescents in 9th-11th grades will be recruited to complete a research
protocol of self-report and behavioral measures at their home schools at baseline (n=700); adolescents with
suicide ideation history (est. n=225) will be recruited into follow-up assessments at 6- and 12-months post
baseline. Teacher reports for the 225 adolescents with suicide ideation history will also be collected. ANOVA
will be used to determine how cognitive and contextual factors and suicide ideation history differ for SGM vs.
cisgender, heterosexual students. To test hypotheses about factors associating with suicide ideation
persistence and remittance and if these associations depend on SGM status, moderation analyses will be
used. SGM status will be tested as a moderator in the relationships between risk factors and suicide ideation
persistence. The supplement will also provide research and career mentoring for the trainee, to assist in
advancing their goals of attending a Clinical Psychology PhD program and establishing a research career."

Neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, are fundamentally characterized
by neuronal damage and cell death. Development of adult and pluripotent stem cells for cellular therapies or
therapeutic screening platforms may enable and accelerate novel treatment options for neuronal diseases.
However, ensuring the precise differentiation of stem cells into functional neurons within 3D culture environments
presents a significant challenge. To overcome this hurdle, this project aims to create novel bioprinting
methodologies for the production of human stem cell-based organoids by developing novel functionally-
optimized bioinks and optimized hydrogel formulations for pharmacological screens. Aim 1 focuses on
developing a customized bioink, which includes water, biopolymers, ions, and cells, to optimize biochemical
activity and mechanobiological responses. This endeavor aims to create a brain-like matrix under 100 μL using
a multi-material approach involving proteins, polysaccharides, and functionalized nanoparticles. The goal is to
reproducibly produce 3D constructs that reduce the variabilities introduced from under-defined commercial
sources. For this research, the bioink formulation incorporates gelatin, collagen, crosslinking enzymes,
photoinitiators, silica nanoparticles, neuron-inducing chemicals, and human stem cells. This formulation aims to
foster the emergence of functional neurons 2-4 weeks after the 3D bioprinting process. Aim 2 focuses on the
high-throughput (HT) assessment of neurotoxic chemicals' effects on the differentiation process of 3D hydrogel-
encapsulated neural stem cells. Utilizing commercial hydrogels for initial tests, this research will explore chemical
differentiation processes and evaluate the influence of neurotoxic chemicals on neuronal differentiation.
Characterization efforts will involve high-throughput imaging analysis methods plus flow cytometry that will allow
drawing correlations among bioink components and differentiation potentials. By comparing the outcomes with
those obtained using custom bioink formulations (from Aim 1) vs. commercial products such as Matrigel and
Geltrex, this project aims to identify a new bioink formulation that has the potential to revolutionize how we
consider and conduct tissue engineering research, including high-throughput molecular screening work. This
would accelerate progress toward the development of screening platforms and new therapies for
neurodegenerative disorders."

The project proposes to continue the work of the Produce Safety Alliance (PSA) to educate
growers, packers, and other stakeholders involved in the U.S. fresh produce supply chain as the
Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) Produce Safety Rule (PSR) continues to evolve. The
PSA develops effective and accurate educational resources to enhance understanding and
implementation of the FSMA PSR requirements and Good Agricultural Practices. The goal of the
PSA since 2010 is to promote the safety of fresh fruits and vegetables by leveraging
partnerships and collaborations to make required training (21 CFR §112.22(c)) available to
covered farms and other stakeholders in the form of high-quality and engaging PSA Grower
Training (GT) Courses. The PSA GT Course is available in three formats (online, remote, and
in-person) and multiple languages. The PSA Train-the-Trainer Course, Lead Trainer Application
review, and Trainer-of-Trainers development process ensures that a sufficient cadre of qualified
PSA Trainers are available to provide covered farm personnel and others with access to the
PSA GT Course domestically and internationally. The PSA supports the current cadre of 3,645
current PSA Trainers, Lead Trainers, and Trainers-of-Trainers in their efforts to stay current with
FSMA PSR changes and scientific understanding. The PSA works to provide growers and
packers with consistent information for implementing produce safety practices at their
operations by making educational materials concise, readable, and accessible on the PSA
websites in many formats (e.g., videos, factsheets, illustrations) to support different learning
styles. As the FSMA PSR and guidance documents are revised, the existing PSA GT Curriculum
also will need to be revised to incorporate regulatory changes, evolving policies, and guidance.
The expanded budget in Years 2 and 3 will allow for the development of an updated PSA GT
Curriculum and supplemental educational materials, in English and Spanish. The PSA will
update past PSA GT Course participants, the PSA Trainer cadre, and other stakeholders
through a coordinated outreach effort that includes update trainings in multiple formats. In
addition, a proposed expansion of the PSA Team will reverse attrition and allow the PSA to
increase efforts to mentor training teams, host continuing education efforts such as monthly
Educators’ Calls, and support diversity and inclusion with enhanced outreach to traditionally
underserved groups and others with limited access to the PSA GT Course and produce safety
educational materials."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, affecting 6.7 million Americans aged 65 and
older. Tau pathology, characterized by the abnormal aggregation of tau protein, is a prominent pathological
hallmark of AD that shows the strongest correlation with cognitive decline compared to other AD pathological
hallmarks. However, current tau models have limitations in replicating tau pathology observed in AD brains, and
most therapies targeting tau developed in animal models have failed in clinical trials, largely due to species
differences. This underscores the urgent need to develop translational human cell-centric tau models capable of
addressing the critical gap in understanding the mechanisms underlying tau pathology, particularly its
spatiotemporal formation and spread, and its relationship with cognitive decline in AD. The long-term goal is to
create tau models in human neurons in vivo to investigate mechanisms of tau pathology and develop therapeutic
interventions for tau pathology in AD and other tauopathies. In a recent study, we successfully generated a
unique human-mouse chimeric brain model that enables the maturation, aging, and survival of human neurons
for over 18 months. Furthermore, human neurons are widely distributed and functionally integrated into the host
brain. Based on these results and the seeding activity of pathological tau, which can induce normal tau misfolding
and form tau pathology, we hypothesize that injecting pathological tau protein isolated from AD postmortem
brain tissues into chimeric mouse brains will result in tau pathology in human neurons in vivo. The objective of
this project is to develop a human-mouse chimera tau seeding model that recapitulates human tau pathology in
human neurons in vivo without introducing MAPT mutations, and that can be used to investigate the
spatiotemporal formation and spread of tau pathology in human neurons and monitor associated cognitive
dysfunction. Additionally, we aim to elucidate transcriptomic signatures of human neurons during tau pathology
progression to gain deeper mechanistic insights. Furthermore, we will compare tau pathological endpoints
between human and mouse neurons within the same brain environment using the chimera model. We propose
the following aims. Aim 1: To characterize a human-mouse chimera tau seeding model in terms of species-
specific spatiotemporal patterns of tau pathology and associated cognitive dysfunction. Aim2: To determine
disrupted cellular pathways and identify species-specific transcriptomic perturbations associated with tau
pathology progression in human neurons using the chimeras. The successful completion of this project will
advance our understanding of tau pathology and lead to a novel human-mouse chimeric brain model for studying
tau pathology in human neurons in vivo. This innovative model will be a valuable pre-clinical tool for
understanding human tau pathology and testing interventions targeting tau pathology in AD and other
tauopathies."

Our research proposes to elucidate local and systemic immune dysregulation in rosacea with the long-term goals
of developing novel preventative and therapeutic targets and improving overall health outcomes for rosacea
patients. Rosacea is a common inflammatory skin disease with unclear etiology affecting over 14 million people
in the United States alone.1 Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) is a microbe-sensing mechanism that maintains immune
homeostasis in the skin through communication with commensal microbes.2-4 Therefore, we suspect that
understanding the skin microbiota-host interaction is critical to elucidating the pathogenesis of rosacea. Moreover,
the immune dysregulation in rosacea does not appear to be localized to the skin. There is a growing body of
epidemiological evidence demonstrating that rosacea is associated with a wide range of systemic co-
morbidities.40-51 Thus, it is also important to elucidate potential systemic immune dysregulation that can explain
the overall disease burden in rosacea patients. Aim 1: We aim to test the hypothesis that skin dysbiosis induces
transcription and expression of the components of the innate immune response implicated in the pathogenesis
of rosacea. To that end, we will perform multi-omics data integration of the microbiome, transcriptome, and
proteome from rosacea skin in order to delineate the microbiota-host interaction. Aim 2: We aim to test the
hypothesis that there is shared immune dysregulation between the skin and systemic circulation that can explain
the burden of systemic co-morbidities in rosacea patients. To that end, we will perform multi-omics data
integration of the transcriptome and proteome from the skin and blood/serum in order to characterize shared
molecular pathways. Dr. McGee’s career goal is to become a physician scientist with the unique expertise to
apply multi-omics, data-driven, personalized strategies to treat inflammatory skin diseases and their associated
systemic co-morbidities. To achieve this goal, she will undertake a combination of formalized coursework,
workshops, and hands-on training in bioinformatics, computational biology, human subjects research, and
clinical trials. She will also engage in career development activities by participating in a grant writing course and
a K-R transition program. Dr. McGee’s research and career development will be guided by a mentoring team
with several decades of combined experience in successfully transitioning their mentees to research
independence. Dr. McGee’s training will take place at two prominent academic institutions: 1) Beth Israel
Deaconess Medical Center, a major teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School which supports ~250 principal

Osteoporosis is a major public health problem affecting 44 million Americans and costing an estimated $17 billion
in 2001. Bone fractures in the elderly in particular can result in significant morbidity and mortality. Understanding
the renal mechanisms that underlie bone loss in aging is the focus of this application. The kidney is responsible
for Vitamin D synthesis and contributes to the control of calcium and phosphate levels. Bone-produced FGF23
and its co-receptor, Klotho help to regulate these processes, and dysregulation in these factors or any of their
downstream signals can lead to bone loss. Aging also impairs kidney function which may also contribute to
aging-related bone loss. However, whether the bone can affect kidney function is not known.
Tryptophan, one of nine essential amino acids, is a potent anti-oxidant but its levels decrease with aging;
however, its stable oxidized metabolite, kynurenine increases with age and inhibits bone marrow stem cell
proliferation. Work from our laboratory has shown that kynurenine feeding in mice results in bone loss. Our
central hypothesis is that augmented kynurenine levels induce an aged phenotype resulting in both bone loss
and kidney dysfunction through the FGF23/αKlotho pathway.
Dr. Irsik will conduct these experiments under the mentorship of Dr. Wendy Bollag, who has expertise in signal
transduction and has been continuously VA Merit-funded for a dozen years. In order to gain knowledge in aging
research, she will work towards a certificate in gerontology and collaborate with the members of her career
advisory committee to gain expertise in experimental design in aging studies. Dr. Isales will provide expertise in
aging and bone research while Dr. Carbone is an expert in bone issues in veterans and Dr. Dong is recognized
for his research in acute kidney injury. Dr. Irsik will expand her current research skills by learning to perform
DXA, CT and bone histology through the collaborative efforts of Drs, Bollag and Isales. Dr. Dong will provide
assistance in her renal studies, and Dr. Carbone will teach her how to work with large datasets available through
the VA. She will interact weekly with all the members of the Bone Group, comprised of both clinicians and basic
scientists from multiple departments and disciplines, presenting her own research twice a year. She will present
her research at a minimum of two international meetings per year (ASBMR, ASN, GSA or Experimental Biology).
Her transition to independence will be enhanced by the mentorship of Dr. Bollag, who has guided many trainees
to successful careers in academic research. She provides the perspective of a successful woman PhD scientist
while Dr. Isales is a clinician who has advocated for under-represented minority researchers for many years.
Together these two investigators, who have a successful track record of collaborating for approximately 30 years,
will help to ensure that Dr. Irsik receives the mentoring necessary to be well-prepared for an independent
research career in aging. This CDA2 award will be leveraged to obtain the preliminary data necessary for her to
apply for her own VA Merit Award, thereby allowing her to obtain her first tenure-track faculty position."
11044990,"Warzone Veterans exposed to morally injurious events frequently experience numerous difficulties in
functioning. These Veterans often report suicidal ideation and behavior, substance abuse, symptoms of
depression and PTSD, and problems in resuming valued living (e.g., spiritual practice, close relationships).1-7
Despite the transdiagnostic nature of moral injury, there are no moral injury-specific transdiagnostic
interventions. Existing interventions tend to be focused on treating moral injury in the context of PTSD.10-11
In addition to an emphasis on PTSD, these interventions target beliefs associated with moral injury as causal
factors in the development and maintenance of suffering.10-12 An emphasis on altering beliefs associated with
moral injury may not optimally facilitate functional recovery as moral pain from moral violations may be
justified. As one third of warzone Veterans endorse exposure to morally injurious events, it is vital to develop
interventions that can be efficiently disseminated in VHA to facilitate functional recovery.8-9 The ideal
intervention must simultaneously address moral emotions and promote values consistent behavior in the face
of these emotions.
 Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for moral injury (ACT-MI) is a recovery-based,
psychosocial treatment ideally suited for Veterans endorsing difficulties in functioning related
to moral injury.15 ACT teaches skills to help Veterans relate differently to painful thoughts, emotions, urges,
and sensations.40 Rather than focusing on symptom reduction, ACT is an evidence-based intervention that
directly targets functional recovery by assisting Veterans in identifying and engaging in values-consistent
behavior even in the presence of distress. In Veteran populations specifically, ACT has been demonstrated
effective in treating suicidal ideation and depression and as a result, has been “rolled-out” as an evidence based
psychotherapy for depression within VHA.59-60 ACT-MI operates on the principles of ACT, with an explicit
focus on the social functions of moral emotions.13-14 ACT-MI is the only intervention for moral injury that is
based on social functionalism which purports that moral emotions (e.g., shame, pride) serve evolutionary
purposes essential to group survival.15 Thus learning to interact with moral emotions differently is crucial to
recovery. In ACT-MI, a group-based intervention is used to facilitate in-vivo exposure to moral emotions in the
context of values. The proposed two arm randomized controlled pilot study will evaluate the
acceptability of ACT-MI and an active control treatment, and determine the feasibility of the
randomized controlled trial design for a future full-scale efficacy study. To accomplish this goal we
will continue to refine ACT-MI. Veterans enrolled will be randomized to: (a) Present Centered Therapy (PCT)
or (b) ACT-MI, both of which will consist of 12, 90-minute group sessions.
 The specific aims of this study are to: (1) Evaluate the acceptability of the ACT-MI intervention for
Veterans experiencing impairment in functioning associated with moral injury, (2) Determine the feasibility
of the efficacy study design, and to (3) Select measures and calculate the necessary sample size for a future
efficacy study. The performance of validated scales will be measured, in addition to selected NIH Patient
Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System modules.78 All participants will complete a baseline
assessment, post treatment, and follow-up assessment one and three months after completion of ACT-MI or
PCT. Participants in both groups will also complete a post-treatment assessment on the acceptability of the
intervention. The proposed study represents a crucial first step in a line of research likely to yield a recovery-
oriented, empirically-supported intervention for moral injury among Veterans. The objectives of ACT-MI
directly align with Rehabilitation Research and Development's goal to improve Veteran functioning, increase
community reintegration, and to facilitate Veteran centered care."

Huntington’s disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant, progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by
abnormal polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) protein. Despite the monogenic nature
of the disease, HD pathogenesis is highly complex. Recent genome-wide association studies implicated strong
connection between DNA repair deficiency and age dependent onset of HD, which is consistent with our earlier
report showing that the loss of DNA repair activity of polynucleotide kinase 3’-phosphatase (PNKP), but not its
protein level, is a key feature in HD patients. PNKP, an essential DNA end processing enzyme with 3’-
phosphatase and 5’-kinase activities, is involved in multiple DNA strand-break repair pathways, including DNA
double strand break repair (DSBR) via Classical-Non-Homologous End-Joining (C-NHEJ), the major DSBR
pathway in postmitotic neurons. While investigating the biological basis of PNKP inactivation in HD, we isolated
a multiprotein complex from chromatin extract of neuronal cells that involves inflammatory kinase IKK2/β, a
glycolytic enzyme, phosphofructokinase fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3) and HTT, along with PNKP
and other C-NHEJ proteins. IKK2 was reported to inhibit PFKFB3 via phosphorylation, and we found that IKK2
also phosphorylates PNKP in vitro at serine 284, inactivating the protein. Surprisingly, an inhibitor of IKK2
restores PNKP activity and integrity of transcribed genome in HD-derived striatal neuronal cells. Moreover, non-
specific (Lambda) phosphatase treatment of HD nuclear extract restored PNKP activity suggesting
phosphorylation-mediated inactivation in HD. Notably, the level of both PFKFB3 and its enzymatic product
fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F2,6BP), a potent allosteric modulator of glycolysis, are remarkably low in the nuclear
extract of HD patients’ brain tissue. Intriguingly, exogenous F2,6BP restored PNKP activity in such extract.
F2,6BP also restores the activity of otherwise inactive phospho-mimic PNKP mutant (S284E). We thus postulate
that loss of PNKP activity in HD patients is due to IKK2-mediated phosphorylation of PNKP at S284. The central
focus of this renewal application is to unravel how specific posttranslational modifications of PNKP and PFKFB3
regulate protective vs. destructive roles under homeostatic vs. pathogenic conditions, respectively. We
hypothesize that functional inactivation of PNKP and degradation of PFKFB3 via IKK2-mediated
phosphorylation at specific residues under neuroinflammatory conditions in HD causes accumulation
of DSBs in the transcribed genome of vulnerable neuronal and glial cells, triggering their death. To
elucidate the causal pathway leading to HD, we will determine how IKK2 modulates PNKP activity in HD (Aim
1); and elucidate the role of PFKFB3 in modulation of PNKP activity in HD patients and animal models (Aim 2).
We will further test, as a proof of principle, whether delivery of F2,6BP+ IKK2 inhibitor can rescue mutant HTT-
induced toxicity. The knowledge gained from our studies will help understand the underlying cause of the HD
and would help develop novel therapeutic interventions in HD and possibly other polyQ diseases."

Reperfusion of cerebral microcirculation after cerebral artery blockage can have dual roles —
neuroprotection if reperfusion is early but adverse events and increased neurological disability if
reperfusion is delayed. Mechanical thrombectomy has revolutionized care in adult stroke and is of proven
benefit in multiple randomized clinical trials with time windows gradually increasing from 4.5 to 24 or more
hours. In children with arterial ischemic stroke, retrospective case series suggest safety and possible
benefit of thrombectomy, however selection bias, lack of non-treated control outcomes and insufficient
knowledge of when it is safe to remove thrombus in childhood arterial ischemic stroke (CAIS) raise
concerns on whether children can safely benefit from endovascular thrombectomy. Knowledge of
mechanisms of adverse effects of late recanalization/thrombectomy in CAIS is essentially inexistent. We
will fill this gap in knowledge using novel CAIS mice models and explore novel therapeutic agent.
Central Hypothesis: TLR4-neutrophil axis mediates injury and hemorrhagic transformation in
childhood arterial ischemic stroke (CAIS).
In a model of late reperfusion/recanalization in juvenile male and female mice, following 8h transient
middle cerebral artery occlusion, we will examine whether pharmacologic neutrophil elastase (NE)
inhibition attenuates the magnitude of hemorrhagic transformation, brain edema, injury, the inflammatory
response, and alters leukocyte phenotypes. Using multimodality MRI, we will examine effects on
secondary hemorrhagic transformation and chronic injury in relation to new vessel formation, vessel
complexity in vivo, myelination and long-term functional outcomes. We will examine efficacy of NE
inhibition in a model of local thrombus formation in the juvenile brain (Aim 1). We will use loss-of-function
experiments to determine if disrupted TLR4 signaling in neutrophils attenuates acute hemorrhagic
transformation and inflammation and improves long-term functional outcomes of CAIS (Aim 2). We will
examine beneficial effects of ApTOLL, a novel TLR4-binding DNA aptamer shown protective in a Ib/IIa
acute adult stroke clinical trial, and determine if ApTOLL protects by disrupting TLR4 signaling in
neutrophils and altering neutrophil phenotypes (Aim 3).
 The proposed studies will serve as proof-of-principle in CAIS models in defining the mechanisms of
hemorrhagic transformation following late recanalization or thrombus formation. The proposal is novel
conceptually, uses novel animal models and state-of-the art methodologies, and examines if ApTOLL, the
first successful neuroprotectant in humans in a long time, can protect children who suffer stroke and
alleviate adverse effects of late recanalization."

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a fundamental learning process that is common across species and essential
for cognitive flexibility and survival. In addition to neuroscience and psychology, RL also has proved valuable in
the field of artificial intelligence (AI), achieving super-human performance in complex tasks. Understanding of
the neural mechanism of RL would facilitate not only the development of diagnosis and treatment for learning
and cognitive disorders but also development of novel deep RL architectures in AI. In this proposal, we aim to
gain insights into how different brain areas work together to support RL.
To tackle this problem, we use a behavioral task that entails two layers of RL at different timescales: fast RL to
solve the task within a session and slow RL to learn the fast RL strategy over weeks/months of training. By
leveraging mouse genetics and cutting-edge technology such as longitudinal two-photon calcium imaging of
neural population activity and dopamine signaling, optogenetics, plasticity perturbation, and modeling with
artificial deep RL networks, we will investigate the neural mechanisms of the fast and slow. In particular, we
hypothesize that synaptic plasticity in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) plays a central role in slow RL. We will
investigate the functions of OFC and its dopamine signaling in RL in Aims 1 and 2. In Aim 3, we will examine
how OFC interacts with other cortical areas in RL. These aims will uncover the large-scale circuit basis of
different aspects of RL and offer a novel conceptual framework to understand how RL is implemented in the
brain."

Research Abstract
Background
Prostate, breast, and pancreatic cancers all have a disproportionately higher rate of aggressive tumor
grade and early onset in Black patients, with recent spikes of high incidence in West African nations
compared to other African regions. The genetic background correlations implicate predispositions.
Members of our SAMBAI team of investigators have pioneered genomics in cancer disparities research,
and over the past two decades, we have uncovered compelling evidence of distinct immunological
mechanisms associated with genetic ancestry. Our SAMBAI team members have developed methods to
quantify environmental exposures and interrogate the lived experiences of marginalized populations,
including epigenetic responses to racism.
Aims
We will partner with scientists across the US, Africa, and the UK to build an unprecedented resource, the
SAMBAI Biobank and Data Repository for Cancer Equity Research. We will generate a comprehensive,
accurate, and relevant measurement of social, environmental, genetic, and immunological factors to
complete an integrated set of analyses to define the causal vs. modifier relationships of disparate
outcomes in diverse underserved populations. We will establish a sustainable framework for team science
approaches with under-represented partners and establish best practices for coordinating cancer equity
research on a global scale.
Methods
We propose to utilize multiple methods across our different work packages. Social Determinants include
self-reporting surveys and database abstractions. Exposomes utilize mass spectrometry of plasma.
Genomics will utilize three sequencing methods on germline and tumor tissue, including long read,
short/deep, and ultra-low pass whole genome sequencing. Lastly, immunological profiles will be
measured with spatial transcriptomics and circulating multiplex immunoassays. These data require novel
computational frameworks, including cloud-based virtualization and the use of machine learning
technologies to identify novel associations across the strata of social to spatial data elements and across
our diverse geographic and ancestral SAMBAI cohorts.
Utility and Impact
We will improve research capacity in under-resourced environments for large-scale cancer research and
equitable access to data with equitable feasibility to improve treatment and outcomes. We will define
interactions of environmental exposures, social determinants, and genetic ancestry that determine
immunological landscapes of primary tumors and/or circulating immunological profiles in patients of
African descent. Our project will contribute a data repository with 100K features/patient, for 40,000
patients. The impact on this population includes a novel trial design, in collaboration with our patient
advocacy partners, to ensure that the specific genomic and immunological features we uncover become
part of targeted precision oncology theragnostic options."
11044920,"Microglial activation and neuro-inflammation regulate disease progression in diverse neurodegenerative di-
seases (NDs), including but not limited to Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and Tauopathies. Under-
standing pathways that regulate neuro-inflammation in NDs is a significant goal. Cellular Prion Protein (PrPC) is
best known as a GPI-anchored membrane protein that, in rare circumstances, undergoes conformational change
to generate a derivative that aggregates in the brain, causing rapid ND and death. Pathogenic PrPC is trans-
missible. Non-pathogenic PrPC is expressed widely, inside and outside the CNS. Numerous studies in diverse
mouse model systems have shown that PrPC attenuates inflammatory responses, including neuro-inflammation.
We contributed to this field by identifying a system of receptors that mediates the anti-inflammatory activity of
PrPC in macrophages when PrPC is released from cells by ADAM family proteases (S-PrP) or in exosomes and
other extracellular vesicles (EVs). This receptor system includes LDL Receptor-related Protein-1 (LRP1) and
the NMDA Receptor (NMDA-R). Binding of PrPC derivatives to the LRP1/NMDA-R receptor assembly in mac-
rophages blocks pro-inflammatory responses initiated by diverse Pattern Recognition Receptors. We now have
data showing that the PrPC-LRP1/NMDA-R interaction initiates anti-inflammatory cell-signaling in microglia. We
also have shown that the anti-inflammatory activity of S-PrP may be harnessed in small synthetic peptides (14-
mers, 4-mer) corresponding to a putative LRP1-binding motif in PrPC that includes Lys100 and Lys103. The major
goal of this research project is to characterize the activity of PrPC and the LRP1/NMDA-R receptor system in
neuro-inflammation in NDs. A second goal is to test whether PrPC derivatives may be administered therapeu-
tically to amplify the activity of the microglial LRP1/NMDA-R system and thereby attenuate neuro-inflammation.
Three specific aims are proposed. In Specific Aim 1, we will test the ability of anti-inflammatory PrPC derivatives
to regulate microglial activation and secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators by microglia and astrocytes in res-
ponse to proteins that accumulate and aggregate in the extracellular spaces of the CNS in various NDs, including
amyloid-β (Aβ), microtubule-associated protein Tau, and α-synuclein. In Specific Aim 2, the effects of PrPC gene
(Prnp) deletion on biomarkers of microglial activation and neuro-inflammation will be studied in three distinct
mouse models of ND, including AppNL-F mice, P301S-Tau transgenic mice, and mice that receive intracerebral
injections of α-synuclein pre-formed fibrils. In Specific Aim 3, we will replicate the studies proposed in Specific
Aim 2, studying tga20 mice, which express 3-4× more PrPC in the CNS compared with wild-type mice. Next, we
will exploit the known ability of LRP1 to serve as a Blood-Brain Barrier Trojan Horse-receptor that transports
proteins into the CNS and test whether systemically administered PrPC-derived proteins and peptides augment
the anti-inflammatory activity of the microglial LRP1/NMDA-R receptor system in the CNS. Collectively, these
studies will elucidate a novel anti-inflammatory system that may be highly significant in diverse NDs."

The objective of this psychological technology SBIR/STTR Fast-Track proposal is to provide an innovative
gamified biofeedback solution (software-only) to improve the effectiveness of functional Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (fMRI) for pediatric pre-neurosurgical planning. Maximal safe resection of an epileptic focus to
optimize outcome is carefully balanced against impact on critical brain regions that could result in
neurodevelopmental deficits. To avoid deficits such as aphasia or paralysis, surgeons rely on pre-surgical
functional brain mapping to define borders for safe resection. Gold standard, invasive functional brain mapping
via electrocortical stimulation (ECS) is complex, time consuming and carries medical risks (e.g. seizures). It is
extremely challenging for children, to tolerate the often-uncomfortable electrical stimulation. FDA cleared non-
invasive fMRI is a safer alternative for functional mapping. Unfortunately, fMRI has yet to reach its full potential
in pediatrics. Motion as low as 0.2 mm causes distortion of the fMRI signal. Clinical fMRI tasks are also
performed covertly (i.e., no overt speech, no recording of button presses). Functional maps are generated
post-hoc, so scan operators and patients cannot know if sufficient usable data were collected, resulting in 50-
90% clinical pediatric fMRI failure rates due to motion and poor task compliance. NOUS Imaging Inc. has
developed FDA 510(k)-cleared Framewise Integrated Real-Time MRI Monitoring (FIRMM) software for tracking
motion and its effects. Use of FIRMM can greatly improve the chances of obtaining usable fMRI maps,
reducing fMRI data loss rates due to motion by >50% in children. FIRMM currently displays brain motion to the
scan operator and patient in real-time, enabling scan operator intervention and patient self-regulation. In this
Fast-Track application, we will extend development from FIRMM to FIRMM Qx with gamified biofeedback and
task compliance tracking, to provide a new, neuro-developmentally appropriate, biofeedback-based quality
improvement solution for pediatric clinical fMRI. In Phase I we will develop and verify FIRMM Qx as a tool to
greatly reduce fMRI mapping failures due to non-compliance, motion or both. In Phase II, we will demonstrate
that FIRMM Qx is superior to fMRI without real-time QC and biofeedback, providing more accurate maps and
lower non-invasive brain mapping fail-rates for pediatric epilepsy surgery planning. NordicNeuroLab (NNL) is
the leading supplier of fMRI hardware and software, used for fMRI at > 2000 institutions worldwide. However,
NNL fMRI fails whenever insufficient quality fMRI data are collected. A new, synergistic partnership between
NOUS and NNL will add FIRMM Qx real-time motion and task compliance improvement to NNL fMRI. NOUS
will be providing developmental psychology know-how, while NNL provides best-in-class fMRI hardware, post-
processing and a large distribution network. Adding FIRMM Qx, to the NOUS portfolio and NNL user base will
make epilepsy surgery for children better and safer."

All eukaryotic cells require cholesterol (Chol) for survival and regulate their steady-state levels by balancing de
novo synthesis, uptake of Chol-containing lipoproteins, and Chol efflux (i.e., “Chol homeostasis”). Hereditary
defects in processes that affect normal Chol homeostasis comprise a family of diseases, some of which have
pathological effects on the retina. Our current understanding of Chol homeostasis in the retina remains
comparatively rudimentary. Other than Chol per se, how other circulating lipids and lipid-soluble molecules
impact retinal Chol homeostasis remains largely unknown and unexplored. This Supplement project piggy-
backs onto an already approved parent project funded under the NIH Bench-to-Bedside initiative (NOT-OD-24-
027; Award #1167401). The overall objective of that project is to assess the effects of a novel fish oil
supplement enriched in very-long-chain (C≥24) polyunsaturated fatty acids (VLCPUFAs) on cardiometabolic
risk factors and visual function. The present Supplement project seeks to test the hypothesis that VLCPUFAs
can alter Chol homeostasis in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Relevance: the RPE, as the cellular
interface between the choroidal blood supply and the neural retina, is a central player in regulating retinal Chol
homeostasis. We will use cultured iPSC-derived RPE cells as a model system to test our hypothesis. We
predict that exogenous VLCPUFAs will have beneficial effects on retinal Chol homeostasis in a manner that is
protective against retinal degeneration. The study outcomes likely will advance our fundamental understanding
of retinal Chol homeostasis and provide useful insights regarding improved therapeutic intervention against
retinal degenerations."
11045562,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Among the 20% of US adults experiencing laryngeal symptoms, 80% are diagnosed with laryngopharyngeal
reflux (LPR) based on symptoms alone and empirically treated with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). However,
laryngeal symptoms respond poorly to PPIs, and patients often seek additional evaluation (on average 10
consultations & 6 diagnostic tests). Despite an arduous journey, patients rarely achieve clarity or relief. This
usual care approach for laryngeal symptoms significantly impairs quality of life, leads to PPI overuse, and
accounts for $50 billion in annual health care costs. The therapeutic dilemma is that varied mechanisms
beyond gastric acid contribute to laryngeal symptoms and, thus, acid suppression with PPI is insufficient as a
sole therapy. Through clinical trials and outcomes research, our team has identified novel mechanism targeted
laryngeal recalibration therapy to address hyper-responsive laryngeal mechanical and cognitive behaviors.
Another critical challenge is in the diagnosis of LPR. Our team has developed and validated an array of novel
metrics with tremendous diagnostic potential including acid exposure time, a risk prediction score and salivary
biomarkers (pepsin, bile acids). These cutting-edge discoveries in light of diagnostic and therapeutic gaps for
LPR indicate that a trial of mechanism guided versus usual care PPI is an urgent, unmet need. We are
uniquely positioned to address these critical gaps as we have assembled a multidisciplinary team with the
requisite expertise in clinical trials, esophageal physiology, laryngology and laryngeal recalibration therapy to
ensure successful design and high-quality execution of the MVP (Mechanism guided vs PPI) trial for LPR. This
randomized controlled trial (n=160) will compare a mechanism guided strategy which will provide laryngeal
recalibration therapy to all subjects as well as PPI to those with elevated esophageal acid versus the usual
care empiric PPI strategy in order to address two overarching aims. Specific Aim #1 will determine efficacy of a
mechanism guided strategy in patients undergoing evaluation for LPR; and, Specific Aim #2 will examine
performance characteristics of esophageal acid exposure, risk prediction score, and salivary biomarkers in
order to identify reliable diagnostic methods for the evaluation of LPR. The"

Project activities:
Communities receive information in diverse formats-- from trusted community health workers,
cultural brokers, local language media, and community leaders. We have learned that cultural
specificity and trust is critical to this work. Many of these immigrant communities of color are
very trust relationship-oriented, and messages are well reserved from the trusted messenger.
Most communities utilizing these products do not refer to government public health websites
or the FDA websites. We propose expanding the culturally responsive content we have been
creating and the community-based education to address skin-lightening practices and chemical
exposures. Grounded in community participatory approaches, we will train and build ethnic-
based media such as community radio, television, and website. To empower and develop the
health literacy of ethnic media leaders and staff as it relates to combating skin-lightening
practices and chemical exposures. In many of the immigrant communities that we serve, their
source of media information is not the mainstream media; rather, their source of information and
media is ethnic media that is culturally and linguistically relevant to them. These ethnic media
understand cultural norms and are positioned to deliver public health messages safely and more
effectively within these communities. Having credible information is so important to most of the
immigrant communities of color that we serve, and the ethnic media is positioned to cover
important information that is beneficial for their communities.
Our primary objective is to continue increasing public awareness and education on the health
dangers associated with skin-lightening creams and products that contain mercury and
hydroquinone that are manufactured in other countries and brought into this country and sold
illegally online or in stores. Through our work, we have seen secondary manufacturing of skin-
lightening products, where individuals are mixing multiple skin-lightening products with the
intent to relabel and sell them as a new product. It is important to continue and expand upon
the public education we have already done. This funding will support us in that process. Our
education and awareness training will not only include increasing the public's understanding of
the toxic chemicals used in skin-lightening products, chemicals like mercury, hydroquinone, and
steroids but also the negative health impacts posed by these chemicals. We will work to
educate communities about this issue, why these products are so prolific within their
community, and their effects on mental health, cultural wellness, and overall well-being."

This application is from the Nebraska Research Network in Functional Genomics (NE-INBRE) in response to
NOT-GM-24-001 regarding the availability of administrative supplements to IDeA Awards to Fund Team Science
Development Projects. We have assembled a team of four Nebraska investigators with diverse and
complementary backgrounds and expertise who will use cutting edge bioinformatic and human organoid
approaches to investigate the molecular mechanisms regulating human hematopoiesis and bone related
disease. Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSCs) are governed by numerous positive and negative feedback signals
within the bone marrow niche. The crosstalk between HSCs and cells in the microenvironment is critical for
efficient production of blood cells and when it is perturbed, as with diseases like cancer, it can have serious
consequences. However, the molecular mechanism regulating this interaction are not well understood and are
difficult to model ex vivo. This project will combine expertise in hematopoiesis and bone marrow biology
with state-of-the-art human bone marrow organoids and cutting edge genomic and bioinformatic
analysis with a team science approach to address one of the main themes of the NE-INBRE.
Goals of the Parent Award: The Nebraska Research Network in Functional Genomics (NE-INBRE) is aimed at
developing the biomedical research capacity at institutions of higher education in Nebraska. The NE-INBRE is
structured around two major components: Primary Undergraduate Institutions (PUIs) and PhD granting Research
Institutions (RIs). Support for each PUI consists of: 1) campus research capacity development through support
for faculty research and infrastructure enhancement, and 2) development of the undergraduate research pipeline
of students through the NE-INBRE Scholars Program. Two features are associated with expanding research
capacity at the RIs: 1) Providing significant support to multi-user core facilities in order to allow investigators from
PUIs and RIs access to cutting-edge technology, and 2) providing support in the form of first-year graduate
assistantships for NE-INBRE scholars who matriculate into PhD programs at the RI campuses. The three
participating RIs in the research network include two campuses of the University of Nebraska system and one
privately supported medical center. Cutting edge multi-user core facilities include cores in genomics,
bioinformatics, and imaging. The three themes reflect the scientific foci of the NE-INBRE: cancer, cell signaling,
and infectious disease. These themes serve to link faculty and students at the separate institutions into
productive networks based on their areas of expertise and interest.
Research Question to be addressed in the Supplement Proposal: Until recently, the major limitation in
dissecting the complex interactions between the HSCs and the microenvironment has been the lack of suitable
models. Traditional ex vivo co-culturing approaches do not replicate the complex architecture of the bone
marrow. Mouse models have important limitations due to species difference between mice and humans. The
primary goal of this proposal is to develop human bone marrow organoids as a tool to dissect the
mechanisms regulating hematopoiesis in both the normal and the disease context. Establishing and
refining this technique in Nebraska will reveal novel discoveries and lead to new research collaborations.
To achieve this goal, we assembled a team of four accomplished investigators with expertise in human
organoid biology, hematopoiesis, leukemogenesis, and bioinformatics. AIM 1 (led Dr. A. Black) will produce
bone human marrow organoids for use in other Aims and develop tools to enhance use of these structures.
AIM 2 (led by Dr. C. Guda) will develop machine learning models to characterize cellular and
transcriptional hematopoiesis with human bone marrow organoids. AIM 3 (led by Dr. K. Hewitt) and AIM 4 (led
by Dr. K. Hyde) will use the tools developed in AIM 1 to test mechanisms regulating human HSC self-renewal
and differentiation under healthy and malignant conditions. Transcriptomic data from these aims will be
incorporated into the models developed in AIM 2.
Benefit of the Team Science Effort: Each sub-project in this proposal uses cutting-edge techniques and could
be performed independently, but will greatly benefit from incorporating the tools, protocols, and advancements
developed by the other projects. For instance, the tools developed in AIM 1 will be incorporated into the
experimental plans for Aims 3 and 4. The computational characterization from AIM 2 will be used as a basis for
comparison with the models of normal and malignant hematopoiesis developed in AIM 3 and 4, but also lead to
new ideas for approaches in AIM 1. In addition, integration of the data from AIMs 3 and 4 has the potential to
reveal the differences and similarities between different causes of hematopoietic dysfunction. The orthogonal
tools and models developed under this award will lead to new insights and advancements that would not be
possible as stand-alone projects.
This project falls well within the scope of the parent NE-INBRE award, and the research questions
proposed here do not duplicate any part of the work funded under the parent award."

The syndrome of delayed anaphylaxis to red meat, i.e. the alpha-gal syndrome (AGS), is found exclusively in
patients who have serum IgE antibody (ab) to the oligosaccharide galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose (alpha-gal).
This form of sensitization is related to bites of the tick Amblyomma americanum, however other ticks appear to
be relevant in other countries. The objective of the parent study is to investigate the epidemiology, etiology,
immunology and clinical features of AGS which is now known to be common in a large area of the USA. In this
supplemental application we propose to build off existing cross-sectional cohort studies to carry out
prospective longitudinal studies on AGS patients. We will also prospectively follow individuals from the
community at-risk for alpha-gal sensitization on the basis of tick bite history. This research will provide
important information about clinical and immunologic aspects of AGS natural history. In addition, we propose to
collaborate with colleagues in Vascular and Cardiovascular surgery to investigate alpha-gal antibody
responses in patients undergoing implantation of biologic grafts or valves. The goal is to determine whether
implantation of porcine or bovine-derived biologics (which contain alpha-gal) can induce IgE and/or IgG
antibodies to alpha-gal. We will also follow these patients over time to determine if graft or valve failure is more
common in patients with high-level antibody responses to alpha-gal."

Viruses that successfully evade clearance without killing the host establish chronic infection.
However, unresolved low-grade inflammation causes morbidity over time, including development
of cancers. How to appropriately modulate immune responses to chronic infection without further
damaging the host represents a major clinical challenge. Type-17 immunity is invoked by
extracellular bacteria and fungi to control resident microbiota and invading pathogens at barrier
surfaces, and to promote tissue repair. Th17 cells have received much attention as drivers of
inflammation in chronic autoimmune diseases. However, there are sparse data regarding the role
of type-17 responses in response to viral infection. Here we have employed the well-characterized
model infection, LCMV clone 13, to test the role of IL-17 during chronic viral infection. IL-17 was
increased systemically during the switch to the chronic phase of infection. Using genetic and
antibody-mediated blockade of IL-17, our data unexpectedly reveal that IL-17 regulates Th1 and
CD8+ T cell activation, exhaustion and immunopathology during LCMV infection. We have
identified lymphoid stromal cells known as fibroblastic reticular cells (FRC) as key intermediaries
of IL-17 effects in secondary lymphoid tissues. Gene expression analysis and antibody-mediated
blockade support a role for excess IFNg in driving T cell exhaustion and immunopathology. These
unexpected findings lead to our central hypothesis that IL-17 has an immunoregulatory role during
chronic infection by limiting antiviral T cell IFNg-mediated exhaustion and immunopathology. This
project is designed to dissect the key elements that we have identified to be required in this
unexplored immunoregulatory pathway in chronic infection by probing the source of critical IL-17
(aim 1), LN stromal cells as targets of IL-17 (aim 2) and IFNg-mediated effects on exhaustion and
immunopathology in absence of IL-17 signaling (aim 3). Together these data will define a novel
and previously unexplored axis operating through IL-17 signaling in stromal cells to regulate IFNg-
mediated pathology, revealing new opportunities for future therapeutic intervention in chronically
infected people."

Antiretroviral therapy has transformed HIV infection into a chronic disease and the population living with HIV
infection (PLWH) is aging. PLWH are twice as likely to develop cardiovascular disease (CVD) and in the past
two decades, the global burden of HIV-associated CVD has tripled. Chronic inflammation and immune activation
persist in the setting of treated HIV and are strongly predictive of CVD events and mortality. In the general
population, acquired mutations in hematopoietic cells (clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential, CHIP)
increase with age and are associated with an increased risk for CVD and premature MI independent of age or
other traditional risk factors. Clonally expanded blood cells contain large scale mosaic chromosomal alterations
(mCAs) which also increase with age and are associated with risk for infectious disease, and mortality but have
not been studied in HIV. While the underlying mechanisms for excess risk of CVD among people with CHIP
mutations is not clear, recent studies suggest the NLRP3/IL-1β/IL-6 pathways play a role. This is critically
important because these pathways represent targets for immunomodulatory therapy and underlying
mechanisms by which PLWH have an excess risk of CVD. Our group has demonstrated that HIV is associated
with a 2-fold increase in CHIP and have a high prevalence of mCA but the relationship between CHIP/mCA and
CVD risk in PLWH has not been evaluated; furthermore, the underlying mechanism for increased CHIP/mCA
among PLWH remains unknown. We plan to study the existing Veterans Aging Cohort Study Biomarkers Cohort
(VACS BC) which is a prospective observational cohort of 1525 HIV+ and 853 HIV- Veterans with extensive
adjudicated outcomes, existing data on biomarkers of inflammation, and immune function. An additional 1000
PLWH in the Center for AIDS Research Network of integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS) and 1002 PLWH in the
Department of Defense (DoD) cohort will also be studied. We hypothesize that HIV is a fertile substrate for
development of CHIP mutations and mCAs and that CHIP activates inflammation to drive HIV-associated
atherosclerosis. We propose the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: To determine if CHIP mutations and mCAs are
more prevalent in PLWH vs. uninfected individuals (Aim 1A). and to determine whether the presence of CHIP
mutations/mCAs are associated with an increased risk of CVD and mortality events in PLWH (Aim 1B); Aim 2:
To elucidate the mechanism underlying CHIP/mCA in HIV by evaluation of markers of inflammation/immune
activation, epigenomics, and HIV viral reservoir size; Aim 3: To investigate whether clonal populations of immune
cells from PLWH with CHIP display altered gene regulatory programs that increase pathologic activation of
specific immune cell types. If our hypotheses are correct, CHIP/mCAs may serve as a novel biomarker for CVD
risk among people aging with HIV infection and help identify those PLWH who may benefit most from
immunomodulatory therapies. With the completion of these specific aims, we will advance our understanding of
the role that CHIP mutations/mCAs play in the development of CVD among PLWH."

Certain invasion-related maternal-fetal diseases (IMFDs) occur due to either insufficient or excessive
placental invasion into the endometrium. These are serious conditions, sometimes requiring surgical
interventions including hysterectomies, and leading to symptoms including fetal growth restriction and
preeclampsia. Previous work from the mentor (Kshitiz, UConn Health) and collaborators (Profs. Levchenko
and Gunter, Yale) studying the evolutionary history of diverse placental phenotypes has established the
central role of the endometrial stromal fibroblasts (ESFs) in controlling the extent of the invasion. The
proposed training and research plan will allow me to study the molecular basis of the endometrial stromal
control of placental invasion, including the effect of ESF-trophoblast signaling on this regulation, as I gain
the training and experience needed to launch my independent research career. During the K99 phase, my
previous training and experience in bioinformatics and computational biology will be augmented by
training from my mentor in the systems biology approach, constituting a closed loop methodology
combining phenotypic assays, theoretical modeling, experimental validation, hypothesis refinement
feeding back into experimental investigations. Exploiting the apposite model of the regulation of placental
invasion in eutherian mammals to understand IMFDs, I have since mathematically mapped and
experimentally validated the genomic basis of this variation in depth of placental invasion through specific
regulatory molecules such as GATA2 and TFDP1. Further, I found evidence that stromal invasability genes
could be conserved across tissue types, with congruent effects between placental invasion in ESFs and
melanoma invasion into skin fibroblasts. This opens avenues for delineating the molecular mechanisms of
ESF-trophoblast signaling effects on the stromal regulation of invasion, with likely parallel mechanisms
underlying dysregulated invasion in IMFDs. Using bioinformatics, bioengineered assays, mathematical
modeling I found and validated the effect of IL11s secreted by extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs) on the
decidual ESF invasability and MMP1 production through SOCS3. I will also explore how different
subpopulations within the human endometrium interact with the invading EVTs, and the downstream
signaling effect of this interaction. All molecular components identified by these methods will be validated
on a bioengineered in-vitro stromal invasion assay, functionally advanced by me, to map the stromal
genotype to specific invasion related sub-characteristics. Another microfabricated technology platform, that
I co-developed with the mentor will be augmented to infer the sequential EVT-ESF paracrine cross-talk .
During my R00 phase I will build informatics-mathematical models to predict IMFD outcomes by
integrating models from my two K99 aims with deep analysis of patient sample ESF sequencing data"

This application is for an administrative supplement to DA058314, Development of practical screening tools to
support targeted prevention of early, high-risk drinking substance use. The purpose of the supplement is to
preserve, generalize, document, and disseminate a unique research material we have developed for the
DA058314 project. Namely, we aim to create an open-source toolkit of bespoke metadata, code, and

ABCD Study poses a major barrier to outside users pursuing the development of screeners or other prediction
instruments. By lowering these barriers, the toolkit we develop will unlock the unprecedented potential of the
ABCD Study for developing accurate, equitable approaches to risk estimation and prediction, in turn improving
the ability of clinicians, policymakers, and scientists to allocate resources efficiently. We will disseminate the

11043752,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Translation initiation establishes the reading frame for protein synthesis and dedicates the translational
machinery to the production of specific mRNAs depending on cellular need. Not surprisingly, translation
initiation is the rate-limiting and most highly regulated phase of translation. Misregulation of translation initiation
is a causative factor in human cancers; altered levels of translation initiation factors are implicated in cancer
development and progression and specific steps of the initiation pathway are altered to enable the rapid
proliferation of cancerous cells. Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF3) is the largest and most complex
of these initiation factors, plays a role in every step of the initiation pathway, and has emerged as a player in
translational regulation. Five essential subunits compose the eIF3 complex in S. cerevisiae, constituting a core
complex conserved across eukaryotes. Altered expression of each of these subunits provokes cancer
development or progression, and several subunits have emerged as proto-oncogenes or therapeutic targets.
However, a mechanistic framework for understanding these causal links to cancer does not yet exist. In fact,
fundamental gaps in our understanding of eIF3 and its mechanistic contributions to translation initiation remain.
In particular, how eIF3 contributes to mRNA recruitment to the ribosome remains a mystery. Recent high-
resolution structures have revealed eIF3 binding to the small ribosomal subunit and projecting arms near the
mRNA-entry and exit channels through which mRNA enters and exits the ribosomal pre-initiation complex
(PIC). These structures also suggest that a dynamic rearrangement of the eIF3 entry-channel arm occurs in
response to mRNA binding by the PIC. However, the mechanistic role of this potential rearrangement remains
unknown, as do the roles of the eIF3 mRNA-entry- and exit-channel arms or their constituent subunits. We are
combining powerful genome-scale technologies with ensemble and single-molecule biochemical approaches
to address these fundamental questions. We have developed a recombinantly-reconstituted eIF3 complex that
recapitulates the in vitro functions of eIF3, enabling for the first time the study of individual subunits or sub-
complexes, as well as lethal eIF3 mutations in vitro. We will leverage this system to dissect the mechanistic
contributions of the mRNA-entry-channel arm subunits (Aim 1) and the communication between this arm and
the mRNA-exit-channel arm (Aim 2). Using multiple complementary genome-scale tools, we will reveal how
specific mutations targeting these two arms affect the translation of specific mRNAs across the transcriptome.
Together, these efforts will shed light on the mechanistic roles of eIF3 and its subunits during mRNA
recruitment, and connect these to the broader biological roles of eIF3 in living cells. This new understanding
will contribute to a framework for interpreting the critical role of eIF3 in cancer development and progression."
11043850,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Viruses are well-established causes of central nervous system (CNS) disease in the most vulnerable
populations, particularly in the young and immunocompromised. During CNS infection, the immune
response can inadvertently cause neuropathology, resulting in neuronal death and demyelination.
Mouse models of viral infection have served as a valuable tool for dissecting mechanisms of
demyelinating disease in the adult brain, and a rich body of literature has revealed a complex role for
the immune response in demyelination. However, we know little about how viruses disrupt myelination
in childhood, when both neurons, oligodendrocytes (OLs), and immune cells are actively maturing.
Thus, true myelin restoration remains an elusive therapeutic goal in demyelinating diseases at all ages.
The long-term goal is to identify mechanisms to support the preservation and repair of brain cells in the
very young. The overall objective of this project is to evaluate the response of oligodendrocyte
precursor cells (OPCs), which ultimately give rise to myelinating OLs, during a viral infection in the
developing brain. Using a juvenile mouse model of neuron-restricted virus infection, where OPCs/OLs
are bystanders to the antiviral immune response, we have found that OPCs expand dramatically during
infection, and infiltrating adaptive immune cells are primary drivers of this OPC response. The general
hypothesis is that OPCs are spurred to proliferate by infiltrating B cells during a juvenile infection, but
that full-fledged OPC differentiation is ultimately impeded by virally-infected neurons. The general
hypothesis will be tested via the following the specific aims: (1) determine the protective role of juvenile
immune cells in promoting OPC proliferation; and (2) define the role of OPC maturation in recovery
from demyelination during a juvenile infection. In Aim 1, we will use genetic and molecular approaches
to define how OPC proliferation and maturation are regulated by subsets of B cells over the course of a
juvenile infection. In aim 2, we will assess how virally-infected neurons regulate the differentiation of
newly-generated OPCs using in vivo and in vitro approaches. The expected outcomes are that we will
define cellular and molecular interactions that direct OPC fate during a juvenile viral infection.
Collectively, these results are expected to have a significant impact by providing a basis for the
development of therapies to preserve or restore myelination in the young brain. This research aligns
with NIND's mission by generating fundamental insights into interactions between the brain and
immune cells, and by applying that new knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological disease in the
most vulnerable populations."

Research Abstract
Background
Prostate, breast, and pancreatic cancers all have a disproportionately higher rate of aggressive tumor
grade and early onset in Black patients, with recent spikes of high incidence in West African nations
compared to other African regions. The genetic background correlations implicate predispositions.
Members of our SAMBAI team of investigators have pioneered genomics in cancer disparities research,
and over the past two decades, we have uncovered compelling evidence of distinct immunological
mechanisms associated with genetic ancestry. Our SAMBAI team members have developed methods to
quantify environmental exposures and interrogate the lived experiences of marginalized populations,
including epigenetic responses to racism.
Aims
We will partner with scientists across the US, Africa, and the UK to build an unprecedented resource, the
SAMBAI Biobank and Data Repository for Cancer Equity Research. We will generate a comprehensive,
accurate, and relevant measurement of social, environmental, genetic, and immunological factors to
complete an integrated set of analyses to define the causal vs. modifier relationships of disparate
outcomes in diverse underserved populations. We will establish a sustainable framework for team science
approaches with under‐represented partners and establish best practices for coordinating cancer equity
research on a global scale.
Methods
We propose to utilize multiple methods across our different work packages. Social Determinants include
self‐reporting surveys and database abstractions. Exposomes utilize mass spectrometry of plasma.
Genomics will utilize three sequencing methods on germline and tumor tissue, including long read,
short/deep, and ultra‐low pass whole genome sequencing. Lastly, immunological profiles will be
measured with spatial transcriptomics and circulating multiplex immunoassays. These data require novel
computational frameworks, including cloud‐based virtualization and the use of machine learning
technologies to identify novel associations across the strata of social to spatial data elements and across
our diverse geographic and ancestral SAMBAI cohorts.
Utility and Impact
We will improve research capacity in under‐resourced environments for large‐scale cancer research and
equitable access to data with equitable feasibility to improve treatment and outcomes. We will define
interactions of environmental exposures, social determinants, and genetic ancestry that determine
immunological landscapes of primary tumors and/or circulating immunological profiles in patients of
African descent. Our project will contribute a data repository with 100K features/patient, for 40,000
patients. The impact on this population includes a novel trial design, in collaboration with our patient
advocacy partners, to ensure that the specific genomic and immunological features we uncover become
part of targeted precision oncology theragnostic options."
11046857,"PROJECT SUMMARY– RUSTBELT CFAR UGANDA CORE C Revision Overall
The RUSTBELT CFAR is the only CFAR to have a robust international core, the Uganda Core C, which runs
advanced virology and immunology laboratories at the Joint Clinical Research Centre (JCRC) in Kampala,
Uganda, and has long been the centerpiece of the CFAR. We have expanded Uganda's highly productive and
unique CFAR activities to include technology transfer of advanced drug resistance, HIV cure, somatic mutation
and DNA methylation assays, and advanced clinical virology tools developed by Pitt. The “RUSTBELT CFAR
Ugandan Faculty Development Program” will be an intensive two-year experience providing start-up funds,
pilot grant awards, salary support, and intensive mentoring in Uganda and through exchange visits to RUSTBELT
CFAR laboratories and Cores. We anticipate sponsoring 3 translational investigators or clinical
investigators during the current iteration of the Rustbelt CFAR, which is funded until 04/30/2027.
Participants’ career development will be fostered by dual mentorship between Ugandan and Rustbelt CFAR
mentors, opportunities for hands-on experiences in clinical studies, and coaching and collaboration in preparing
competitive NIH grant proposals. Support for faculty development in Uganda will not simply be restricted to Core
C activities in Uganda since the entire CFAR clinical and laboratory infrastructure will be used to support
technology transfer and promote research with our Ugandan colleagues. We have included annual working visits
to the US to promote technology transfer, advanced training, and expansion of collaborative activities. The
Clinical Services Core D will provide insights into the maintenance of highly curated clinical specimens and
rigorous sample acquisition for translational studies. Our laboratory-based cores, Viral Pathogenesis &
Persistence Core E and Systems Biology & Biostatistics Core F, draw on research strengths from both
institutions and offer access to cutting-edge emerging technologies for transcriptome and reservoir analyses.
Expertise in HIV prevention (SWG2) and sex-based differences in HIV pathogenesis and cure (SWG1) will add
new dimensions to Core C’s clinical research opportunities in Uganda. USTBELT CFAR investigators have greatly
benefited from attracting talented young investigators from Uganda for advanced training and research in our
laboratories. In addition to exposing us to different perspectives on the challenges of the AIDS epidemic from
people living and working at one of its epicenters, we benefit from their skills and dedication to research. This
new initiative will substantially ameliorate the chronic underrepresentation of translational and clinical
researchers from low- and middle-income countries and enhance the diversity of investigators focusing on HIV-
focused clinical and translational studies throughout the CFAR."
11044940,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This revision application to the UCSF-Bay Area CFAR aims to strengthen our support for diverse HIV
researchers or investigators who study disparities in HIV and foster investigators from the pipeline
(undergraduate/masters’ level students) to early career faculty, all through revisions to our Developmental
Core. Key initiatives include the CFAR Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Pathway Initiative (CDEIPI) Scholars’
program, a mentored summer research internship for undergraduate/masters’ level students from a historically
minority-serving institution in San Francisco (Aim 1); a mentoring training program for underrepresented early
career investigators or those who study health disparities (Aim 2); and a career development award program
for faculty working with diverse populations or from underrepresented minority backgrounds (URM) (Aim 3).
The application’s overarching goal is to formalize and integrate successful diversity initiatives into the
Developmental Core, ensuring our sustained impact on creating a pipeline of investigators who can contribute
to ending the HIV Epidemic.
Our work proposes three aims. The first aim is to sustain and expand the CFAR Scholars Program, providing
mentored research experiences for local minority-serving institution students, particularly from
underrepresented backgrounds. We aim to leverage our mentoring infrastructure and emerging URM mentors
to make this a lasting program within our CFAR. The second aim is to support and train underrepresented
early career investigators in mentoring through the Mentoring the Mentors training program. This program,
specifically targeted to URM postdoctoral fellows and early career faculty, should improve mentor and mentee
outcomes and promote career development. Trainees in this designated mentoring program will be drawn from
our URM Mentoring Program, mentors of our CFAR Scholars (Aim 1), and the Inter-CFAR URM Working
Group we organize. Our final aim is to formalize the CFAR/ARI Career Development Program, supporting early
career faculty from URM backgrounds or working with diverse populations. This program, previously known as
the Diversity Scholar Award, has significantly contributed to the success of past awardees, aiding in grants,
publications, and retention. Each of these programs will be subject to rigorous tracking and evaluation of
outcomes and will be enhanced through repeated feedback cycles detailed in our Plan for Enhancing Diverse
Perspectives. Through these aims, we seek to build a diverse workforce, enhance mentoring capabilities, and
provide critical support for diverse early career faculty. These efforts align with the goals of the funding
announcement by addressing disparities in HIV research, fostering inclusivity, and contributing to improved
health outcomes for individuals living with HIV."
11045416,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Failure to achieve accurate chromosome segregation during meiosis is a leading cause of miscarriages,
infertility, and birth defects such as Down syndrome. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms underlying
accurate meiotic chromosome segregation is of paramount importance to human health. The synaptonemal
complex (SC) is a zipper-like structure present from yeast to humans during meiosis that assembles between
homologous chromosomes, stabilizing homologous pairing interactions and promoting interhomolog crossover
formation. However, despite its importance for achieving accurate meiotic chromosome segregation, the
mechanisms regulating chromosome synapsis and how the SC interfaces with recombination and chromosome
remodeling is not well understood in any organism. Our goal is to identify mechanisms regulating the SC and to
determine how SC regulation is linked to DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair progression and late prophase
I chromosome remodeling to ensure accurate meiotic chromosome segregation. We study this in the nematode
C. elegans because it shares a high degree of gene conservation with humans and affords ease of genetic,
cytological, molecular, and biochemical analysis for germline studies. Our progress during the previous funding
period, coupled with new data and molecular targets, place us in an ideal position to understand the regulation
and roles of chromosome synapsis during meiosis. Here we propose two integrated aims to address these critical
issues. Aim 1 will determine how HIM-22, a protein which shares sequence conservation with yeast Set3 and
human ASH1L, regulates SC formation. HIM-22 promotes protein deacetylation in the germline, interacts with a
structural component of the SC, and is required for regulating SC assembly, crossover levels, and late prophase
I chromosome remodeling; this will define a previously unknown meiotic role for this protein modifier in a
metazoan and a new mode of SC regulation. Aim 2 will determine how NatF-mediated N-terminal acetylation of
meiotic proteins regulates the SC. Our studies show that NatF is required for protein acetylation in the germline,
and regulates SC assembly/disassembly, DSB repair progression, crossover distribution, and late prophase I
chromosome remodeling. We previously found that NatB-mediated N-terminal acetylation of a structural
component of the SC promotes SC assembly. Our past studies on NatB and our current discovery of NatF as a
potential regulator of the SC suggest there is a conserved yet poorly understood regulatory network of different
N-acetyltransferases acting on chromosome synapsis. These studies will shed new light on our understanding
of the mechanisms regulating chromosome synapsis and how these link the SC to DSB repair and late prophase
I chromosome remodeling. Our studies will impact multiple fields of tremendous relevance to human health
including chromosome dynamics, the study of post-translational modifications, and regulation of macromolecular
structures. Taken together, this application will provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms regulating
accurate chromosome segregation during meiosis."

The proposed studies will be done under the auspices of the parent COBRE award (P20GM139763). The goal
of the parent award is to support research project leaders (RPL) to scientific independence in areas of cellular
metabolism by creating and unifying resources under the Center of Cellular Metabolism Research in Oklahoma
(CMRO).
A multitude of complications can arise from type 1 (T1D) and type 2 (T2D) diabetes, which leads to a major
burden on the healthcare system as medical care costs soar from these conditions. One of these complications
occurring among patients with diabetes is non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) that can cause serious liver
damage. NAFLD is a spectrum that ranges from isolated, relatively benign steatosis (NAFL) to the more harmful
non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) associated with liver fibrosis. This liver damage pathogenesis involves a
variety of cell types: in general NAFLD, but especially NASH, is hallmarked by chronic inflammation and
heightened immune cell activity, which can activate hepatic stellate cells and endothelial cells, thereby resulting
in a self-perpetuating pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrogenic network that can eventually progress into liver
cirrhosis. However, the exact cellular contributions, and how these cells orchestrate the propagation of liver
damage are not known, as previous studies mainly focused on the role of individual cell types rather than their
interactions. To fully elucidate disease pathogenesis, it will be important to gain molecular insights into the
reciprocal interactions between the main cell types that drive NAFLD progression, especially since the
pathophysiological complexity of NAFLD has represented a challenge in the development of potential therapeutic
targets, and there are currently no specific pharmacological treatments for NAFLD and/or NASH. Therefore, our
proposal will address these knowledge gaps with regard to the basic mechanisms that promote diabetes-induced
chronic liver disease in an in vivo setting. Herein, we will focus on examining the cell type-specific changes
underlying T1D- and T2D-induced NAFLD/NASH in a cell-dependent manner. The combined expertise of Drs.
Cleuren (endothelial cells), Gorman (immune cells), and Stout (hepatic stellate cells) is unique to this application,
as this forms a highly synergistic approach to study diabetes-induced NAFLD pathogenesis. Elucidating not only
the cell-specific molecular changes but particularly the cellular interactions, which would be lost if individual labs
would only focus on their respective cell type of interest, is likely to uncover novel mechanisms that may lead to
more effective therapies for NAFLD/NASH. Successful completion of this proposal will elucidate cell-specific
differences underlying diabetes-associated complications."

Circadian rhythms are fundamental in sculpting physiology, and their alignment is essential for
optimal health. We have gained deep understanding of the cellular basis as well as the function of the
central circadian clock of the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), but we don’t yet understand how the
SCN interacts with varied peripheral oscillators, and how these peripheral clocks integrate information
from SCN- and non-SCN-inputs to maintain internal alignment as well as entrainment to 24h cycles.
Here we will study two peripheral oscillators, the liver and skin. We will develop an animal model for
study of the role of these peripheral clocks within the circadian system, to determine their entrainment
capabilities.
The central hypothesis of this proposal is that peripheral clocks retain some rhythmic
capabilities when the SCN central clock is impaired, possibly including photic entrainment. The long term
goal of this research is to understand the inter-dynamics of circadian clocks throughout the
mammalian body and, ultimately, discover new tools to lessen the impact of circadian misalignment
on health.
Our research will first aim to characterize our new skin circadian clock reporter line K14 Cre;
DBPKI/+ mice. We will more fully characterize our new mouse line using IVIS imaging, assays, and
histology to rigorously determine sources of the bioluminescence recorded. Second, we will aim to
test photic entrainment of skin and liver circadian rhythms in vivo in mice with or without brain central
clock function. This aim will test the entrainment of skin and liver using methods for long-term
circadian bioluminescent reporting from living animals, first in intact mice and then in mice with
suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) ablation. Third, we will determine if these peripheral tissues show a
wider range of entrainment than the central clock. We will test the ability for circadian rhythms of gene
expression of K14 Cre; DBPKI/+ and Alb Cre; DBPKI/+ mice to entrain to cycles of varied cycle lengths
(“T cycles”), to assess the range of entrainment, as compared with that of locomotor activity, using both
intact and SCN-lesion mice.
Completion of these studies will dramatically alter our understanding of the mammalian
circadian system to include potentially photoreceptive peripheral clocks. The research will be
conducted by diverse and engaged undergraduate women, with structured mentoring to encourage
continued careers in biomedical science."
11042490,"Project Summary
Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a rare hemorrhagic disease in which the bone marrow
cannot make enough red blood cells, possibly due to issues with ribosomes, the translation
machinery essential for protein synthesis. Studying ribosome gene expression will enhance
understanding of DBA, often noticeable in the first year of life, and find better treatments for
young patients. While ribosomes maintain a consistent primary structure and function across
various life forms, they exhibit notable heterogeneity due to variations in ribosomal rRNA and
protein content. This diversity is accentuated in organisms by the presence of numerous
paralogous ribosomal proteins scattered throughout their genomes. Mutations in these paralogs
result in distinct phenotypes, potentially due to the integration of different ribosomal proteins
affecting mRNA translation specificity. This suggests a broader regulatory role for ribosomes in
protein synthesis beyond traditional transcriptional mechanisms. However, the unique
phenotypes observed in paralog mutants could result from generating abnormal or different
amounts of ribosomes rather than truly specialized functions of heterogeneous ribosomes. This
proposed study aims to clarify this ambiguity by investigating the functional divergence of two
critical ribosomal proteins in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (S. pombe): the large subunit protein
27 (Rpl27) and the small subunit protein 19 (Rps19). These proteins, encoded by distinct
paralog genes, exhibit differential expression and regulatory mechanisms. Our preliminary
results show that the absence of Rpl27 paralogs leads to unique cellular phenotypes,
characterized by asymmetric expression and varying mRNA and protein levels under both
normal and stress conditions. Similarly, Rps19 paralogs, despite sharing 97% protein sequence
identity, display divergent regulatory elements and expression patterns, particularly under heat
stress. Our study is designed to test the hypothesis that differences in cellular phenotype
resulting from the absence of ribosomal protein paralogs are due to variations in protein
sequence, abundance, mRNA specificity, or differential functionality under stress. This
investigation, focusing on Rpl27 and Rps19 paralogs, has the potential to transform our
understanding of ribosomal biology and uncover new regulatory mechanisms in the expression
of ribosomal protein paralog genes, which may pave the way for new treatments for conditions
like DBA and improve childcare."
11055960,"The identification of therapeutically actionable genetic lesions in malignancies has transformed patient care. 
However, there remain many individuals who either do not possess these targetable alterations or who relapse 
following therapeutic intervention. Therefore, it is imperative to identify novel mechanisms that control the critical 
biological processes that impact clinical outcomes. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) have emerged as fundamental 
regulators of a plethora of biological processes, and their dysregulation has been established in a variety of solid 
and heme malignancies, making them attractive candidates for study. This application will focus on the role of a 
mutation in an RNA-binding protein, PCBP1, in colorectal cancer initiation and progression. 
Poly-C binding protein 1, PCBP1, is a tumor suppressor that is recurrently mutated in 3% of all colorectal 
cancers. These hotspot missense mutations have been identified as putative cancer drivers in several unbiased 
studies. Critically, a recent study identified PCBP1 mutations as a resistance mechanism to cetuximab therapy 
in colorectal cancer patients. These observations necessitate an in-depth investigation into the pathogenic role 
of PCBP1 mutations. Our preliminary data suggest that the L100Q mutation attenuates the tumor suppressive 
function of PCBP1 and activates oncogenic signaling cascades. 
Our central hypothesis is that the L100Q mutation in the RNA-binding domain of PCBP1 abrogates its tumorsuppressive 
function and promotes malignant phenotypes due to its ability to activate diverse signaling 
cascades. In this proposal we will 1) determine the impact of PCBP1 mutation on the cellular signaling 
landscape, and 2) determine whether the PCBP1 mutants can drive oncogenic transformation and progression. 
Completion of this study will provide insights into the mechanisms by which PCBP1 mutations impact cancer 
signaling pathways, as well as help identify therapeutic vulnerabilities in these pathways. Furthermore, these 
studies will have exciting implications for other structurally-related RBPs implicated in disease. Finally, 
completion of these studies will lend credence to the role of RBPs as therapeutically actionable drivers of 
disease."

Dr. Jonathan Santoro is a clinician-scientist focused on exploring the interface between vascular disease,
cerebrovascular disease (CeVD) and inflammation in persons with Down syndrome (DS). This five-year
mentored career development award will provide him with advanced training and skills in population-based
data analysis, biostatistics, neuroimaging, and clinical trials development to ensure a successful transition to
an independent research career. The outlined proposal builds on previously published work by Dr. Santoro and
leverages a mentorship team of experts in DS, neurodevelopment, vascular disease, and cerebrovascular-
inflammatory disorders in persons with DS at his home institution and other large academic DS centers.
Research Context: Persons with DS have an increased risk of early CeVD, specifically moyamoya syndrome,
and the initial presentation is often irreversible neurologic insult secondary to cerebrovascular accident. For
persons with DS, there exists no validated means of assessing risk for CeVD. This K23 career development
builds on previous work by Dr. Santoro who identified non-invasive ways to screen for CeVD in children with
DS. This study will prospectively asses blood pressure (BP) in persons with DS and subsequently use this to
predict pre-symptomatic CeVD (Aim 1). Next, this study will compare gold standard CeVD neuroimaging
studies to various non-invasive, low-cost, biometric tools such as repeated BP measurements, transcranial
Doppler ultrasound and neurocognitive testing to assess internal and predictive validity of these measures in
the prediction of CeVD (Aim 2). As persons with DS are established to have immune dysregulation and
systemic inflammatory profiles, we will also explore the role of systemic and vascular inflammatory biomarkers
in the development of CeVD with the goal of identifying contributory inflammatory cascades that could be
targeted with therapeutic interventions geared towards preventing CeVD in subsequent studies (Aim 3).
Career Development Plan: Dr. Santoro will complete coursework in healthcare and science communication,
data analysis, epidemiology, clinical trial design and biomedical informatics. This plan also will strengthen his
competence in both bioinformatics and neuroimaging and be supplemented by institutional workshops and
seminars. This experiential learning is designed to promote knowledge and skillset development needed to
both execute his research and ensure that skills are developed for his transition to an independent researcher.
Dr. Santoro’s career development goals will be supported through close mentorship by an experienced and
committed interdisciplinary team and a combination of didactic, experiential, and team-based learning. This
proposal and subsequent R01 proposals seek to improve the neurologic care of young persons with DS."

suppression practices can barely keep up with regional endemicity conditions, despite the fact that New England
has a long history with ticks. With just 4.5% of the U.S. population, New England accounts for 20% of confirmed
Lyme disease cases in the U.S. This project proposes a New England Center of Excellence in Vector-Borne
Diseases (NEWVEC) to make significant progress in combatting ticks and other arthropod disease vectors in
the six New England states through applied research and technical evaluation of methods to prevent vector
bites, suppress disease-causing vectors, and promote public adoption of vector-control measures. To sustain
and amplify this public health imperative, NEWVEC will train students to enter the public health entomology
workforce to address VBD, and will engage stakeholders through a community of practice that can help its
research and training efforts remain relevant, effective, and impactful. The NEWVEC strategy has three
components: Applied research on tick suppression, Training of public health entomologists with expertise in
vector-borne diseases, and Community of Practice to enhance regional effectiveness of evidence-based
methods. Applied research projects will follow four parallel streams: 1) Standardizing and optimizing personal
protection and control products and applications for commercial and residential use; 2) Discovering and
evaluating emerging technologies to suppress ticks and prevent tick biting; 3) Designing and testing habitat and
host-targeted interventions for suppressing tick populations; and 4) Assessing human factors and public health
approaches for tick control. Work in these areas will be conducted by researchers at six New England
universities, supported by two core facilities: a Molecular Analysis lab for pathogen testing and taxonomic bar-
coding at the University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMA), and a Tick rearing and experimental test bed at the
University of Rhode Island. A multi-tiered training program in Public Health Entomology based at UMA will
develop concentrations and certificate programs at both the undergraduate and graduate levels to train highly
competent graduates for employment in the field, while providing a range of high-quality professional
development training experiences for public health professional staff and technical employees of commercial
applicator firms around New England. NEWVEC’s Community of Practice will promote extra-academic
collaboration in its research, promoting two-way transmission of vital knowledge among the center’s researchers,
its students and trainees, the public health stakeholder community, and others concerned with vector-borne
disease prevention in New England. NEWVEC will concentrate on the most important New England vectors,
most challenging barriers to VBD progress, and most promising and impactful vector control interventions and
methods. By being technically credible, NEWVEC will be relied upon by the VBD practice community, thus
influencing adoption of recommendations and promoting scalability to reach all areas in the New England region."

Meditation training is a promising technique that can help improve emotional health of adolescents and facilitate
treatment of adolescent depression. However, there is a fundamental gap in understanding the neural
reorganization that takes place as a result of meditation training. Continued existence of this gap represents an
important problem because, until it is filled, design of more effective interventions is highly unlikely. The longterm
goal is to establish safe and effective methods of promoting emotional health in adolescents. The objective here
is to study adolescents undergoing meditation training by using MRI connectomics to map changes in node
strength (integrated connectivity) of the putamen. The putamen is a region previously associated with meditation
practice and attenuated shrinkage with age in Zen meditators on the one hand, and with love, compassion,
anticipation of pleasure, and responses to increasing intensity of happiness on the other hand. The central
hypothesis is that structural connectivity of the putamen with other brain regions will increase in adolescents with
meditation training and, in turn, positively affect their emotional health. This innovative model is rooted in
preliminary results and previous literature. The rationale for the proposed MRI connectomics approach is that
regular engagement of the putamen is expected to increase myelination of the white matter tracks connecting it
to other regions, which can be probed by using diffusion MRI. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis
will be tested by pursuing two specific aims, which entail studying changes in the putamen node strength and
emotional health measured as internalizing problems and depressive symptoms in 1) a cohort of healthy
adolescents with a 12-week meditation training compared to waitlist controls (R61 phase) and 2) a cohort of
adolescents with mild to moderate depression with a 12-week meditation training compared to waitlist controls
(R33 phase). The “Go/No-Go Criterion” is a medium-large increase of the putamen node strength observed
with meditation training in healthy adolescents in the R61 phase (Cohen’s d>0.6). The optimization strategy for
the R33 phase is based on the fact that anhedonia (diminished ability to experience pleasure) is a key
characteristic of depression and preliminary results show that putamen structural connectivity is lower in
adolescent depression. It is therefore expected that the mechanistic effect in the putamen will be amplified in the
population of depressed adolescents, reflecting normalization of the putamen function. The proposed research
is innovative, because it uses advanced MRI connectomics methods to map changes in brain networks of youth
with meditation training and tests a novel mechanistic model. The proposed research is significant, because it is
expected to greatly advance our understanding of the neural mechanism by which meditation improves
emotional health of adolescents. Ultimately, such knowledge will inform treatment and prevention of adolescent
depression."

 Engaging patients and communities in clinical and translational research improves the impact of research 
because local communities are able to deftly identify the key questions and outcomes that matter most to 
patients and communities. Such an approach requires strong partnerships across a spectrum of community 
stakeholders, where there is clear recognition that the relationship between researcher and community 
stakeholder must be reciprocal, mutually beneficial, cooperative and inclusive. 
 We use the term “community” broadly to include any and all “end users” of research. This includes patients, 
families, neighborhoods, and other physically-defined communities within Delaware, but it also includes other 
communities such as healthcare providers, health system leaders and administrators, public health agents, 
condition-specific advocacy groups, payers, and policy makers--all of whom may benefit from our research. 
Community engaged research (CEnR) is a collaborative process between the researcher and community 
partners with the goal of developing knowledge & strengthening the well-being of communities. 
 The significance and impact of research depends not only on the quality of the research conducted, but also 
on the degree and timeliness of translating findings into clinical, public health, and population health practices. 
Developing approaches to incorporating the input and collaboration of end user communities early in the 
research process through community engagement and outreach is perhaps the most impactful activity we can 
do to significantly reduce the research to practice time gap and reduce health inequities. 
 The ACCEL CTR Community Engagement & Outreach (CEO) Core will make research more significant, 
impactful, and responsive by enhancing and expanding the community engagement work of our earlier funding 
cycles through the accomplishment of the following four specific aims: Aim 1: Assist Delawarean researchers 
working across the translational spectrum (T0-T4) with identifying approaches to including community 
perspectives in their work; Aim 2: Include community voice in all ACCEL CTR activities; Aim 3: Provide

The reprogramming of somatic human cells to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by only four transcription
factors (TFs) Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and cMyc (OSKM) is one of the most striking remodelings of gene regulatory
networks. The remarkable ability of OSKM to reprogram diverse somatic cell types into iPSCs that are
functionally indistinguishable from embryonic stem cells indicates that OSKM leverages a fundamental
mechanism for network remodeling that may be generally applicable to all cell fate transitions. Previous studies
of reprogramming have identified the crucial role of cooperative TF binding in repressing somatic programs and
activating pluripotent ones. However, associating TF binding dynamics and epigenomic remodeling with key
bifurcation events during reprogramming is confounded by the highly heterogeneous nature of the
reprogramming process and the lack of knowledge regarding how the transition from somatic to pluripotent
regulatory programs occurs in individual cells. In this project, we aim to model the regulatory network underlying
the cell fate change of reprogramming using three types of single-cell multi-omic profiles generated from critical
time points during reprogramming. We will interrogate the network leveraging natural perturbation of
reprogramming and pluripotency by genetic variants. Genetic variation is well known to modulate the regulatory
network of pluripotency and contributes to the variability of cellular phenotypes and differentiation capacity of
iPSC lines. We will generate population-scale single-cell joint profiling of RNA and DNA methylation (snmCT-
seq), joint profiling of RNA and chromatin accessibility (scRNA + ATAC-seq) and single-nucleus joint profiling of
chromatin conformation and DNA methylation (sn-m3C-seq), allowing the cell-type-specific determination of
transcriptome, chromatin accessibility and methylation states at regulatory elements, as well as enhancer-gene
looping to connect non-coding variants to their regulatory target. To integrate OSKM binding with the single-cell
transcriptomic and epigenomic dynamics, we will determine the allele-specific binding of TFs and histone
modifications using a pooled-alleles ChIP-seq strategy. We will use Dynamic Regulatory Events Miner (DREM)
to construct predictive models by integrating transcription factor-gene interaction information with time- and
pseudotime-series genomics data. To determine the genetic regulation of the reprogramming network, we will
apply the novel statistical method FastGxE to distinguish cell-type-specific from the shared genetic component
of gene expression regulation, to enhance the sensitivity for identifying cell-type-specific quantitative trait loci
(QTLs). To test the regulatory network, we will experimentally determine the function of network hub genes and
non-coding variants using high-throughput CRISPR interference and precise variant replacement experiments.
Our proposed project integrates diverse approaches including single-cell multi-omics, computational modeling,
and genetic engineering, and will likely provide new insights into the mechanism by which TFs remodel regulatory
networks of cell type identity and serve as a model for similar analyses in other systems."

Opioid dependence is a global public health issue for which more effective treatments are urgently needed.
Opioid dependence is characterized by exacerbated brain stress signaling that drives an anxious, dysphoric,
and irritable state that contributes to the intensity of opioid-seeking and opioid-taking in opioid use disorder
(OUD). Neuropeptide S (NPS) administration, through interaction with its cognate receptor Neuropeptide S
Receptor 1 (NPSR1), has an anxiolytic profile of action that is opposite to the anxious phenotype observed in
withdrawal during OUD in both rodents and humans. The current proposal hypothesizes that agonism of the
NPSR1 can alleviate the anxious phenotype observed during OUD and thereby ameliorate the intensified
motivation to seek and consume opioids that is observed in OUD. A unique strength of this approach is that NPS
agonism of NPSR1 is able to generate an anxiolytic profile of action without producing the sedative-hypnotic
effects which are a common, major limitation of currently available anxiolytic compounds. We present novel data
using a model of alcohol dependence demonstrating the potential for the anxiolytic action of NPS to curb the
motivation to seek drugs of abuse. However, to date, NPS has not been evaluated for its ability to curb opioid
self-administration. The few pieces of data available suggest that NPS and NPSR1 are implicated in opioid
reward, and that brain levels of NPS and NPSR1 are dysregulated by repeated opioid exposure. Successful
demonstration of the therapeutic potential of NPS-NPSR1 manipulations would fill this obvious gap in our
collective scientific knowledge and provide strong justification for a future effort to develop a novel OUD
medication based on manipulating NPS-NPSR1 interaction.
 The present R21 proposal seeks to identify a new neurobiological modulator in the context of opioid
consumption, dependence, and relapse, and is therefore inherently high-risk in nature. Nevertheless, we propose
a multi-faceted approach built on solid logic that has the potential to reveal a completely novel target in our
collective efforts to develop effective OUD treatments. The proposed research team is ideally suited to
completing this short-term research project, possessing all necessary expertise, equipment, and materials
required to start the project. Specifically, we plan to leverage the best-available pharmacological tools for
agonism and antagonism of the NPSR1 and use well validated preclinical models for testing therapeutic
relevance for distinct features critical to the progression of OUD. By completing this short-term project, we will
rapidly characterize the therapeutic potential of NPSR1 in the context of OUD, testing three compounds (each
of which could potentially be leveraged in developing OUD treatments in the future) for their therapeutic efficacy
against OUD in preclinical animal models. It is our firm belief that this project will be successful in these short-
term goals. In the big picture, completion of this project will provide the necessary justification for a future R01-
level application to support a large-scale, collaborative effort to develop novel NPSR1 ligands."

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a heritable disorder affecting 1.3 million individuals in the United States.
Eighty percent of people with FH have not yet been diagnosed, and this gap is even more robust for people from
minoritized populations, including Black or African American people. Family cascade screening is an evidence-
based practice that includes contacting and screening family members of people diagnosed with FH, but it is
rarely implemented representing a care gap in all populations, and particularly in Black or African American
people. The proposed work aims to use multi-methods to elucidate factors related to implementation of cascade
screening in Black or African American people in pursuit of identifying targets for future strategies to mitigate this
inequity. The parent grant supporting this Diversity Supplement is a hybrid effectiveness-implementation type III
randomized controlled trial testing the comparative effectiveness of two strategies to implement family cascade
screening with individuals with FH. Closing inequities in minoritized groups including African American or Black
people, Asian or Asian American people, and women across racial groups is a focus of the parent grant,
specifically by exploring equitable reach by sub-population, and in conducting interviews and centering diverse
voices. Under the primary mentorship of Dr. Rinad Beidas, the candidate, Ms. Chynna Mills, will extend the aims
of the parent grant using an established framework for health behavior to examine understudied multi-level
factors using multi-methods that may be related to reach of family cascade screening for Black or African
American people. In Aim 1, Ms. Mills will examine the relationship between a set of theoretically informed multi-
level candidate variables and the primary outcome (reach) in 100 Black or African American probands. In Aim 2,
Ms. Mills will explore mechanistic pathways of cascade screening reach via qualitative interviews. Ms. Mills has
prior experience examining multi-level factors impacting Black or African American people’s participation in
health interventions and is committed to a career as an independent investigator focused on improving
implementation of and engagement with evidence-based practices for Black or African American populations.
This Diversity Supplement will support the candidate’s development of an independent program of research
through mentored training. Results will offer insights on how to close inequitable gaps in implementation of
cascade screening with Black or African American populations and has the potential to lessen disparities in reach
of family cascade screening for Black or African American people with FH and other heritable genetic disorders."
11045959,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Research Question to be Addressed:
 The application of immunotherapies, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), in the treatment of
cancer has led to significant improvements in long-term patient outcomes. However, existing therapies are not
effective in all patients, and our knowledge of the immunological factors that contribute to positive treatment
responses and resistance remains limited. This demands targeted research efforts to more comprehensively
characterize immune profiles in patients receiving immunotherapies, as a means to uncover biological
mechanisms of action and identify more effective biomarkers of treatment response or resistance. Novel tumor-
infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapies hold great promise in the clinic for cancer patients that have proven
refractory to other treatment strategies. This proposal will take a multi-omic and data-driven approach to deeply
characterize immunological signatures in blood and tumor tissues obtained from melanoma patients participating
in a clinical trial testing the efficacy of a novel TIL therapy. Our goal is to identify specific biomarkers that
associate with treatment outcomes. This effort will result in unique and rich immunological datasets and novel
tools and models for clinical outcome prediction and will drive the design of next-generation immunotherapies.
Impact of Proposed Team Science:
 To effectively address the research questions posed, we have assembled a team of researchers with
diverse expertise and skill sets. Our team builds from our parent COBRE, drawing on the extensive expertise of
MPIs Chesney and Yan, who are world leaders in cancer immunology and clinical research. Both will make
critical contributions through administrative oversight. Our research team includes three independent
investigators with established research programs in cancer immunology (Yaddanapudi; Aim 1), genomics and
immunogenetics (Watson; Aim 2), and bioinformatics and data science (Park; Aim 3). Studies proposed in Aims
1 and 2 are focused on the deep characterization of immunological profiles of melanoma patient tumors, TILs,
and blood collected pre- and post-treatment using multi-omics approaches. These aims will delineate
immunological variables that vary between tissues and patients in the context of TIL therapy. Given the complex
nature of the high-dimensional datasets to be generated in Aims 1 and 2, the activities planned for Aim 3 will be
critical to advancing the overall objectives of the proposal. Specifically, studies proposed in Aim 3 will focus on
building more streamlined pipelines and tools for processing and analysis of data generated in Aims 1 and 2. In
addition, the second major activity of Aim 3 will include the construction of novel machine learning models for
predicting therapy outcomes, via the integration of datasets (from Aims 1 and 2) with the rich de-identified clinical
data that will be collected as part of the trial. Critically, the completion of the Aims outlined here will lead to a
foundational compilation of integrated datasets and accompanying models that can be extended into the later
phases of this clinical trial and future efforts. These deliverables will also serve as key preliminary data for
pursuing hypothesis-driven multi-PI R01 applications and advancing efforts for obtaining an NIH SPORE award
focused on the treatment of melanoma.
Goals of Parent COBRE Award:
 The overarching objective of the parent COBRE award was to establish the Center for Cancer
Immunology and Immunotherapy (CCII), a multidisciplinary research center of excellence, focused on advancing
discoveries in cancer immunology to improve the development of novel immunotherapies. The motivation for
this program was built around the 10-year successes of the UofL-Health-Brown Cancer Center in leading clinical
trials of immunotherapeutic agents. Leveraging this long-term track record, the CCII COBRE has focused on
more effectively integrating clinical and basic research endeavors across the School of Medicine. The CCII is a
unique program, being the only COBRE program exclusively focused on cancer immunology and immunotherapy
development. This is evidenced by the fact that, in the initial funding period, all scientific/research objectives led
by Junior Faculty and their mentors were centered around applying novel approaches to identifying
immunological factors linked to cancer progression and/or treatment outcomes. Through these efforts, our
Center Investigators have been able to establish the infrastructure and resources, including critical tools and
methodologies, needed for generating large-scale genomic and immunological data in human and animal model
systems. This success has laid a foundation for us to orient our research capabilities toward solving key
questions in the clinic. Specifically, this Team Science Development Project proposal will be focused on
enhancing discoveries from a unique immunotherapy clinical trial currently being conducted at our Cancer Center
and seeks to capitalize on our successes by establishing a critically needed research team, composed of COBRE
graduates (Drs. Yaddanapudi and Watson) and additional faculty across the School of Medicine (Drs. Park,
Rouchka, and Smith)."

Research Abstract
Background
Prostate, breast, and pancreatic cancers all have a disproportionately higher rate of aggressive tumor
grade and early onset in Black patients, with recent spikes of high incidence in West African nations
compared to other African regions. The genetic background correlations implicate predispositions.
Members of our SAMBAI team of investigators have pioneered genomics in cancer disparities research,
and over the past two decades, we have uncovered compelling evidence of distinct immunological
mechanisms associated with genetic ancestry. Our SAMBAI team members have developed methods to
quantify environmental exposures and interrogate the lived experiences of marginalized populations,
including epigenetic responses to racism.
Aims
We will partner with scientists across the US, Africa, and the UK to build an unprecedented resource, the
SAMBAI Biobank and Data Repository for Cancer Equity Research. We will generate a comprehensive,
accurate, and relevant measurement of social, environmental, genetic, and immunological factors to
complete an integrated set of analyses to define the causal vs. modifier relationships of disparate
outcomes in diverse underserved populations. We will establish a sustainable framework for team science
approaches with under-represented partners and establish best practices for coordinating cancer equity
research on a global scale.
Methods
We propose to utilize multiple methods across our different work packages. Social Determinants include
self-reporting surveys and database abstractions. Exposomes utilize mass spectrometry of plasma.
Genomics will utilize three sequencing methods on germline and tumor tissue, including long read,
short/deep, and ultra-low pass whole genome sequencing. Lastly, immunological profiles will be
measured with spatial transcriptomics and circulating multiplex immunoassays. These data require novel
computational frameworks, including cloud-based virtualization and the use of machine learning
technologies to identify novel associations across the strata of social to spatial data elements and across
our diverse geographic and ancestral SAMBAI cohorts.
Utility and Impact
We will improve research capacity in under-resourced environments for large-scale cancer research and
equitable access to data with equitable feasibility to improve treatment and outcomes. We will define
interactions of environmental exposures, social determinants, and genetic ancestry that determine
immunological landscapes of primary tumors and/or circulating immunological profiles in patients of
African descent. Our project will contribute a data repository with 100K features/patient, for 40,000
patients. The impact on this population includes a novel trial design, in collaboration with our patient
advocacy partners, to ensure that the specific genomic and immunological features we uncover become
part of targeted precision oncology theragnostic options."

11045438,"PROPOSAL SUMMARY
 Deficits in social interaction are characteristic of several neuropsychiatric disorders, including Autism
Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The cellular, molecular, and circuit mechanisms of social deficits in ASD are largely
unknown and warrants further research. One of the most consistent etiological findings in ASD is a complete
deletion of the SHANK3 gene, which encodes a postsynaptic scaffold protein in neurons. Our lab developed the
first Shank3 complete knockout model by deleting exons 4-22 (Shank3∆e4-22). Shank3∆e4-22 mice show decreased
social and reward-seeking behavior and blunted response of the Nucleus Accumbens (NAc) to social cues.
 The NAc is a well-established regulator of social behavior. Yet, the characteristics of neurons in the NAc
that are active during social behavior, or social ensembles, are not well defined. ~95% of neurons in the NAc are
medium-spiny neurons (MSNs) that express either dopamine receptor D1 (D1+), which encode reward
reinforcement, or D2 (D2+), which encode aversive responses. NAc MSNs express high levels of SHANK3, and
Shank3 deletion induces profound changes in D2+ MSN function. Taken together, this indicates a potential
mechanism of action for social behavior deficits in Shank3∆e4-22 mice.
 SHANK3 scaffolds HOMER1b/c and metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) to the postsynaptic
density (PSD). HOMER1b/c and mGluR5 function in the NAc is crucial for regulating social and reward-seeking
behaviors in WT mice. To study the role of SHANK3-HOMER1b/c interaction, our lab generated the first
SHANK3-HOMER1b/c mutant mouse, Shank3PL. Since joining the Jiang lab, I have collected pilot data showing
that Shank3PL mice have significantly decreased social and reward-seeking behavior. Pilot data also indicate
Shank3PL mice have decreased HOMER1b/c expression in the PSD of the NAc.
 The specific objective of this proposal is to delineate how SHANK3 deficiency causes cellular and
molecular malfunctions that underlie abnormal circuit and social behavior using our two novel mouse models:
Shank3∆e4-22 and Shank3PL. First, I hypothesize that NAc social ensembles in Shank3∆e4-22 mice are primarily
composed of D2+ MSNs and encode aversion and negative sociability; in contrast, I predict WT social
ensembles are predominantly D1+ MSNs and encode reinforcement and positive social behavior. Second, I
hypothesize that SHANK3-HOMER1b/c scaffolds are crucial for social and reward behavior. We will test these
hypotheses using comprehensive methodologies.
 This study will be the first to characterize social ensembles in a well-validated genetic ASD model and
the first to investigate the role of SHANK3-HOMER1b/c scaffolds on behaviors and NAc activity. Importantly,
these studies may lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets for treating social and reward deficits in
ASD and other neuropsychiatric disorders."

11044019,"Despite a wide-ranging interest in performing clinical research for bioelectronic medicine applications, there are
no available open-architecture and open-source implantable systems for autonomic nerve stimulation and
recording. As a result, clinical researchers face significant technical, regulatory, and financial hurdles in getting
access to the implantable neuromodulation technologies that are required for performing these clinical studies.
There are several clinical closed-loop implantable neuromodulation systems presently available and they have
been helpful in supporting clinical research. However, in their current form, none are suitable for the bioelectronic
medicine applications, as they lack key modules for accessing the autonomic nerves; moreover, many of them
use closed architectures and proprietary software.
 To address this challenge, we propose to develop the PCBA and firmware for the implantable pulse generator

In this proposal, we will define the effects of epigenetic dysregulation via Stag2 loss on three-dimensional
chromatin structure and transcriptional regulation. We will define key lineage-specific chromatin features and
validate their hierarchy in differentiation in contrast to stem cell self-renewal. In Aim 1, we will perform low-input
Hi-ChIP assay on Ctcf (loop/TAD-boundary), Rad21 (pan-cohesin loop), ChIP assay for H3K27Ac (enhancer)
and RNA-seq (gene expression) on phenotypically defined mouse and human stem and progenitors to define
population-specific looping events. Using our novel ‘on-off-on’ dual recombinase (Stag2GL) allele, we will first
determine if the restoration of Stag2 can reverse the effects on self-renewal/differentiation and define chromatin
loops 1) perturbed during Stag2 loss and 2) restored after Stag2 reversion. Locus-specific functional assays will
determine the key events required for self-renewal through in vitro studies to phenocopy in ‘Stag2-on' or prevent
reversion in ‘Stag2-off’. In Aim 2, using our low cell input Hi-C and Hi-ChIP techniques to assess chromatin loops
alterations identified in our fully penetrant Stag2/Npm1c and Stag2/Flt3 co-mutant AML models in combination
with the Stag2GL allele. Using a multi-omics approach, we will define the chromatin landscape of Flt3 and Npm1
with and without the antecedent Stag2 mutation. We have created a well-annotated MDS and AML patient
biorepository, as well as a biorepository of healthy bone marrow from hip arthroplasty patients. Using these
primary patient samples, we will map chromatin loops and transcriptional output in stem and progenitor
populations and intersect lineage-specific interactions in human and mouse. Functional validation of chromatin
loops lost or gained in the co-mutant models will be assessed in vitro, prioritizing loci identified in primary AML
patient samples. These models will constitute the system to assess the effects of Stag2 loss on therapeutic
response to standard chemotherapeutic regimens ad well as to emerging targeted therapies such as Menin
inhibition in Npm1c-mutant AML (DSP5536) and FLT3 inhibition in FLT3-ITD mutant AML (gilteritinib). Finally,
Stag2 reversion in this system will definitively determine whether Stag2 is required for the maintenance of AML,
hereby representing a genetic dependency in Stag2-mutant AML. Taken together, the results of this proposal
will elucidate the molecular pathology of Stag2, thus leading to a deeper understanding of chromatin-related

Our long-term objective is to determine how thalamic networks contribute to memory consolidation. The goal of
this project is to investigate the basic mechanisms by which the dynamics of spike activity in cognitive thalamic
networks contribute to memory consolidation. During non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, spindle
oscillations in thalamocortical networks and ripple oscillations in the hippocampus facilitate memory
consolidation. However, the precise role of thalamic spindle activation dynamics in memory consolidation
remains unclear. We aim to answer two basic questions. First, we will use optogenetics and electrophysiology
to induce spindle-like activity in the thalamus of rats after training them in a memory task to understand how
different patterns of thalamocortical activation facilitate sleep-dependent consolidation. Complementary
computational modeling will help us understand the impact of spindle-like thalamic activation on cortical circuits
and spindles. Second, we aim to determine how the thalamus facilitates hippocampal ripple oscillations and
memory consolidation. We will use behavioral testing, extracellular recordings, and closed-loop optogenetics, to
control thalamic spiking activity after detection of ripple oscillations in the hippocampus. This approach will
enable us to assess the causal contribution of the thalamus to the fundamental NREM sleep oscillations that
facilitate hippocampal-neocortical interactions and sleep-dependent memory consolidation. Understanding the
role of thalamocortical neural dynamics in memory consolidation is clinically relevant for developing new

11044912,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Mucin glycoproteins are the essential component of mucus and the epithelial cellular glycocalyx. Mucins are
essential for life in creatures from jellyfish to humans and play roles in hydration, lubrication, nutrient absorption,
and host defense against pathogens. Mucin glycosylation is regulated by complex enzymatic pathways subject
to flux, resulting in heterogeneous and variable glycan patterns that vary between tissues and species, and that
evolve in response to diet and disease. The Kramer Lab is developing synthetic mucins, or synMUCs, that
harness the chemical and biophysical properties of native mucins but have molecularly tunable structures.
Polymerization of glycosylated amino acid N-carboxyanhydrides affords high molecular weight polypeptides with
the native peptide and glycan linkages. Compared to short peptides, polysaccharides, or traditional polymers
bearing attached sugars, synMUCs are the most authentic mucin mimics to date. The synMUCs will be applied
in engineered models of the glycocalyx and secreted mucus. These models will find broad future application in
studies of epithelial biology with application in cancer, drug delivery, immunity, and infection. Since mucins are
on the front lines of cellular defense, diverse viruses have evolved strategies to adhere to their glycans, alter
them, and even use them to enter host cells for replication. Virus-mucin binding can have outcomes on viral
diffusion, tissue specificity, and replication but molecular details are lacking due to mucin heterogeneity. We will
chemoenzymatically modify our synMUCs to display virus-binding sialic acid glycans. Viral binding preferences
for various sialic acid structures in different densities and from varied peptide backbone compositions will be
defined. The sialic-acid-bearing-synMUCs will be utilized to probe how mucins in the glycocalyx vs mucus
regulate adhesion, cell entry and replication, tissue tropism and viral gene evolution. This knowledge will shed
light on fundamental aspects of the viral life cycle and may assist in improving human health though development
of new antiviral therapeutics and disease transmission prevention strategies. Additionally, scientific citizenship
and mentoring are a priority and active involvement in supporting equity, diversity and inclusion of
underrepresented groups in STEM will be a focus for the duration of the project and beyond."
11043486,"Conducting an accurate yet simple mathematical description of large-scale dynamical networks, such as
biological networks, is an essential yet challenging step toward enabling design and control of such
complex systems. The extraordinary growth of data-rich biology further calls for discovery of transformative
mathematical techniques to facilitate data-driven research on dynamical systems. For example, daily
rhythms in physiology allow organisms to anticipate reliable environmental events and adapt to changing
environmental cues. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) generating these precise circadian oscillations
and adapting to environmental changes is comprised of thousands of circadian neurons in the brain. The
long-term goals of this research are to: 1) create a rigorous kernel method that generates a simple yet
accurate representation for modeling complex nonlinear dynamical processes; 2) leverage this method to
design interpretable and principled data-driven techniques for system control and learning of dynamic
networks; 3) resolve longstanding biological questions about deciphering the underlying dynamics of
coupled circadian clocks; and 4) identify enhanced environmental cues to produce desired behavior
patterns such as chronotype setting and sleep consolidation. This proposal aims to overcome the
significant mathematical challenges to solve important problems in circadian biology. In Aim 1, we will
establish the moment kernel machine (MKM) that generates lossless compression models equivalent to the
first-principles state-space models of dynamic network systems. In Aim 2, we will use the predictive power
of MKM modeling to design signals that create desired synchronization patterns in oscillator networks. In
Aim 3, we will demonstrate the versatility of the MKM technique with applications to circadian biology. This
will involve dynamic learning of the SCN gene expression from measurements; and learning and shaping
the output of SCN networks by designing dynamic light protocols for enforced biphasic sleep in young
animals and consolidation of sleep fragmentation in aged animals, and assigning phases of entrainment
(e.g., onset of daily activities) to animals of different genotypes and chronobiological properties. The
integration of novel mathematical and biological tools will provide insight and guidelines for the theory-
inspired experimental designs and lead to a comprehensive understanding of complex network behaviors

and growth can lead to developmental defects, i.e., organ dysfunction, reduced reproduction, and disease.
While some regulatory pathways have been uncovered in different species, the quantitative prediction of
cell behavior at single-cell resolution in multicellular organisms—though critical—is incomplete. This project
will address this gap by combining experiments, predictive modeling, and data-driven methods in
Ceratopteris (fern) gametophytes. Ceratopteris gametophytes comprise a single layer of cells that grows
from 1 to nearly 500 cells in 12 days, transforming from round to heart-shaped and developing pluripotent
meristems (stem cells). Ceratopteris gametophytes are highly suited for an interdisciplinary approach to
understanding cell dynamics. They allow for non-invasive time-lapse confocal imaging to trace every cell
and are efficient for perturbations. With the long-term goal of determining stem cell behavior using
Ceratopteris gametophytes as a model, this 3-year project will uncover the cellular and molecular
interactions at work during tissue growth and meristem notch formation, and develop a data-driven
approach to associate vertex models with efficient particle models. This project has 3 aims: Aim 1 will
develop the first mathematical models of cell behavior in Ceratopteris gametophytes and establish a cycle
of testing empirical hypotheses in silico and model-generated predictions in vivo. It will uncover how
spatiotemporal differences in cell division and growth drive meristem formation and organ morphology
through mechanical perturbation experiments, quantitative time-lapse imaging, and vertex modeling. Aim 2
will elucidate the signaling molecules behind these spatiotemporal differences through a close coupling of
new chemical and genetic perturbation experiments and hybrid modeling. Aim 3 will tailor a recent method
for learning equations to account for changes in cell number, multi-scale dynamics, and the connected
structure of cells in plant tissue. This research will use this approach to associate vertex models with
simplified—more efficient—particle models and discover equations of motion directly from in vivo nucleus
trajectories. Together this work will shed light on how cell division, growth, and differentiation are controlled
to maintain meristems and define gametophyte shape, and it will increase the applicability of data-driven
methods to collective cell dynamics more broadly."
11043535,"We propose to develop flexible Bayesian statistical methods to gain a comprehensive understanding of
microbial community dynamics using high-throughput sequencing data. The emergence of large-scale
microbiome studies provides new opportunities for understanding how various microbial communities
function and relate to their environment. However, the analytical methodology required to model complex
microbiome data is still lacking. One of the key objectives is to develop a general method for inferring
microbial community dynamics that vary with host and environmental factors. We also aim to extend this
method to complex scenarios, such as longitudinal microbiome studies, which investigate the evolution of
microbial communities, and multi-omics microbiome studies that integrate various types of omics data. Our
proposed methods rigorously address the unique challenges of microbiome data analysis and achieve
more accurate inferences about the underlying biological processes with honest uncertainty quantification.
The proposed methods will provide an opportunity to attain a deeper understanding of the microbiome’s
role, potentially paving the way for intervention strategies that enhance health and disease management.
The proposed research involves synthesizing innovative concepts to tackle statistical challenges in
microbiome data analysis within complex study settings, with a particular focus on multivariate count data
presenting unique statistical complexities. The research agenda is broad and widely applicable, consisting
of methodological development and theoretical examination of model properties, along with a challenging
computational component aimed at achieving computational feasibility for big data. Our semiparametric
methods offer significantly improved accuracy compared to existing methods. Our innovative approach to
imposing a joint sparsity structure on the covariance matrix enhances the ability to infer microbial
interactions. This approach improves robustness against large signals and reduces noise in complex high-
dimensional data.
These models are developed in close collaboration with biologists at UC Los Angeles and UC Santa Cruz,
incorporating domain-specific biological knowledge from microbiome research, and consequently, they
yield biologically interpretable inferences. Our findings, integrated into microbiome research through
collaboration, will advance our understanding of how microbes are functionally related to the host, the
environment, and other microbes. This understanding can ultimately lead to improvements in human health
or the environment through microbiome monitoring or manipulation. Another key aspect of the project
involves disseminating the proposed methods through user-friendly software for public use."

Understanding how T cell receptors (TCRs) see tumor antigens presented by MHCs is necessary to fully
understand how the immune system recognizes tumor antigens, and to reap the full potential of antigen-specific
immunotherapy. To achieve this goal, a quantum leap forward is required in which the revolutionary advances in
machine learning are combined with a large volume of structure, function, data on matched TCR-pMHC pairs.
The development of accurate predictors of TCR-antigen recognition will be dependent on the creation and
integration sequencing-based datasets with high-throughput structural and functional insights. Our proposal,
submitted as a CRUK/NCI Grand Challenge team (MATCHMAKERS) will combine researchers with expertise in
immunology, methods development, structural biology, and computation to enable generalized prediction and
design of TCR recognition. This work will be spread across four Work Packages (WPs):
WP1: Large-scale generation of TCR-pMHC pairs from naturally occurring sources. We will build datasets of
naturally occurring TCR-pMHC pairs. Our team will use an array of approaches to collect these datasets, from
humans and from mouse models, and in the context of both cancer and immunity more generally.
WP2: Ultra-high throughput TCR-pMHC matching using molecular engineering. Efforts to create general models
will require a broader array of data than feasible to collect from natural TCR systems. We will use an array of
synthetic approaches developed by our team to comprehensively match TCRs with pMHCs to train
computational models.
WP3: Large-scale structural and biochemical analyses of TCR-pMHC interactions. A key to our team’s vision is
to match interaction datasets with high throughput structural and functional insights. A deep understanding of
how the TCR contacts with MHC helices control function and orientation will be essential for training and testing
computational models.
WP4 AI-based prediction and design of TCR-pMHC interactions. We will integrate our data to train next-
generation algorithms capable of generally predicting and designing TCR-pMHC interactions. These predictions
will proceed through a reiterative testing and feedback circuits for further model optimization."

 Selective Functionalization of Aliphatic Amines and Derivatives
Aliphatic amines are ubiquitous among pharmaceutical compounds, driving significant research into the
synthesis and functionalization of molecules bearing nitrogen atoms. Traditional strategies use functional group
handles to synthesize amines. We have been engaged in a research program that uses resident C-H bonds
and transforms them directly into the functionality of interest. The central challenge to derivatizing amines,
thus, was one of positional selectivity. A number of strategies were advanced in the previous funding period
with broad success.
In the next funding period, we will expand the repertoire of reactions, the positions of activation and the
complementarity to existing methods. We will develop methods to arylate C-H bonds in aliphatic amines, to
difunctionalize vicinal C-H bonds in analogy to olefin difunctionalization, again with complete positional
selectivity and to use earth abundant metal salts to activate distal C-H bonds of amines. Complementary
approaches will be aimed at providing a method to functionalize inaccessible C-H bonds on tertiary amines,
common components of many FDA approved drugs. These will allow structural diversification of complex
molecules as well as a structural editing approach to provide homologous scaffolds to bioactive molecules.
Lastly, primary amines are surprisingly widely available, far more so than alkyl halides or even carboxylic
acids, no doubt due to the ubiquity and importance of amide bond constructions. We will develop a
complementary strategy that will use the C-N bond as a functional group handle in cross-coupling chemistry.
All of these methods are designed to facilitate drug design and discovery in the pursuit of more efficacious
treatments for human diseases.
The specific goals of this research are as follows:
 1) Site-Selective Remote Functionalization of Aliphatic Amines
 2) Selective α-Functionalization of Tertiary Alkylamines
 3) Deaminative Functionalization of Primary Amines

11042908,"The centromere is a unique chromosomal region that is essential for high-fidelity chromosome transmission
during cell division. In mitosis, microtubules attached to the kinetochore help ensure the faithful segregation of
sister chromatids into daughter cells. Our goal is to understand the mechanisms that govern centromere function.
Centromere identity relies on the deposition of the centromere-specific histone H3 variant, CENP-A but not on
specific DNA sequences. After DNA replication, “old” centromeric nucleosomes are transferred onto the newly
replicated chromatids. In mammals, deposition of CENP-A occurs in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. The
mechanisms of CENP-A deposition and maintenance are crucial for proper centromere inheritance and function
but remain to be delineated. We recently found that EWSR1 (Ewing Sarcoma Breakpoint Region 1) is required
for CENP-A deposition and maintenance at the centromere. We show that EWSR1 and EWSR1-FLI1 (the
oncogenic fusion protein in Ewing sarcoma) bind to CENP-A through the SYGQ2 region within its prion-like
domain known to be important for phase separation. We found that EWSR1 is required for CENP-A deposition
at the centromere. CENP-A is associated with centromeric RNA, which is important for centromere function. We
demonstrate that EWSR1 plays a key role in promoting this association. We also have biochemical evidence
that EWSR1 binds R-loops, a three-stranded RNA-DNA hybrid, through its RNA-recognition motif. Based on
these findings, we hypothesize that EWSR1 plays crucial roles in maintaining centromere structure and function
by binding RNA and anchoring CENP-A in centromeric chromatin. We will test this hypothesis. Aim 1: To
determine the function of EWSR1 and RNA/R-loops in centromere maintenance. We generated EWSR1
conditional KO cells using an AID (auxin-inducible degron) system, which allows us to remove EWSR1 upon
auxin addition. We will test if auxin-induced degradation of EWSR1 abolishes CENP-A signals at the centromere
at different cell cycle stages. We will induce the expression of SETX, which clears RNA-DNA hybrids, at different
cell cycle stages to ask whether centromeric RNA/R-loops are required for CENP-A maintenance at the
centromere. Aim 2: To investigate the function of EWSR1-CENP-A interaction. We will generate EWSR1 mutants
defective in binding to CENP-A by introducing mutations into the SYGQ2 region of EWSR1. We will examine the
phenotypes of the EWSR1 KO cells expressing CENP-A binding deficient mutants. We will also identify the
EWSR1-binding domain of CENP-A. We will then isolate CENP-A mutants impaired for EWSR1 binding. We will
express Flag-tagged mutants in CENP-A KO cells to examine the localization of CENP-A and the phenotypes of
the mutant cells. We will investigate if EWSR1 association with CENP-A is unique for interphase. We will
investigate the mechanism that regulates cell cycle specificity of EWSR1-CENP-A interaction. Aim 3: To test if
EWSR1 anchors CENP-A at the centromere via RNA binding. To test this model, we will directly examine this
model by constructing and testing CENP-A and EWSR1 variants with engineered functional domains."
11039297,"Project Summary
In this R34 application, we propose to conduct an early phase clinical trial of a mind-body intervention to promote whole person health—specifically, to develop and evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a tailored progressive muscle relaxation and walking intervention to reduce fatigue for adults with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Fatigue is an extremely concerning and debilitating symptom that affects the majority of adults with ESKD. Fatigue has a profound negative impact on whole person health for adults with ESKD through its influence on morbidity, quality of life, social relationships, and functional independence. There are no standard-of-care therapies available to alleviate fatigue in ESKD. There is strong evidence, from rigorous randomized controlled trials, that progressive muscle relaxation can reduce fatigue, yet this approach has been understudied in the diverse population of adults with ESKD in the U.S. Physical activity in the form of walking can also reduce fatigue, but again has been understudied as a way to reduce fatigue in adults with ESKD. There has also been minimal investigation into the feasibility and acceptability of multicomponent mind-body interventions to reduce fatigue in adults with ESKD, with an absence of any studies utilizing both progressive muscle relaxation and walking, or utilizing text messaging as a low-demand method of delivering mind-body intervention content. Our objective is to fill these research gaps by developing and evaluating such an intervention. In Aim 1, we will use content from two established evidence-based interventions—a progressive muscle relaxation intervention and a fatigue-reducing walking intervention—and work with a patient advisory board to develop a mind-body intervention tailored for adults with ESKD and fatigue. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the new Fight Fatigue intervention using a two-arm design (n=40 participants, randomized to either the combined progressive muscle relaxation and walking intervention or ESKD education/attention control). The 12-week intervention will be delivered with brief in-person training followed by text messages. Findings from this study will provide the necessary data to design and test a large- scale efficacy trial to reduce fatigue for adults with ESKD and thus promote whole person health for this at-risk population."
11043921,"Project Summary / Abstract
 Pattern formation, the spatial organization of cells of different types, is central to the development
and function of metazoans. Pattern formation also occurs in microbial communities such as biofilms and
colonies. For example, pattern formation is manifested by localization of different cell types to different
regions of a microbial community. Formation of these patterns requires communication between individual
cells, and so the first organisms to communicate were likely microorganisms within communities. From this
perspective, the most ancient and fundamental mechanisms of communication on earth evolved, and still
exist, in simple microorganisms. Here we propose that in the model genetic organism, Saccharomyces
cerevisiae, this communication involves secreted metabolites that serve as cell-cell signals. A variety of
evidence suggests that this type of communication is important in healthy and diseased human tissues.
 Yeast colonies are ideal for investigating pattern formation and the cell-cell signals that underlie
these patterns. Two advantages of this organism are its facile genetics and the depth of knowledge we
have regarding this particular species. Yeast colonies contain a thick layer of meiotic cells at the top of the
colony supported by an underlying layer of feeder cells. Feeder cells are so named because they provide
metabolites to the upper colony layer. A sharp boundary forms between these two layers.
 The focus of the proposed research is the mechanism of differential partitioning-- a change in the
relative allocation of the colony, the ratio of meiotic cells: feeder cells, in response to environment (food,
temperature, etc.). We propose that communities adapt to their environment by differential partitioning.
 Our specific aims are to determine: 1) the role of signaling pathways and their target transcription
factors in regulating differential partitioning in response to environmental cues, 2) the role of secreted
metabolites as a type of cell-cell communication that controls this partitioning.
 To achieve these aims, we will utilize several approaches. First, we will use flow cytometry to
distinguish different colony subpopulations, corresponding to different cell fates, and how environmental
cues and genetic mutations drive the relative allocation of these subpopulation. Second, we will determine
the temporal/spatial expression of genes within colonies using fluorescent-tagged proteins and colony
sectioning. Third, we will identify and characterize metabolites serving as cell-cell signals that control
colony organization.
 The proposed research has potential connections to broader biological topics that are difficult to
study in other organisms. These include biofilm pattern formation, which contributes to the pathogenicity of
some yeast species, the effects of environment on development, and the role of secreted metabolites in
regulating multicellular functions."

Research Abstract
Background
Prostate, breast, and pancreatic cancers all have a disproportionately higher rate of aggressive
tumor grade and early onset in Black patients, with recent spikes of high incidence in West African
nations compared to other African regions. The genetic background correlations implicate
predispositions. Members of our SAMBAI team of investigators have pioneered genomics in
cancer disparities research, and over the past two decades, we have uncovered compelling
evidence of distinct immunological mechanisms associated with genetic ancestry. Our SAMBAI
team members have developed methods to quantify environmental exposures and interrogate the
lived experiences of marginalized populations, including epigenetic responses to racism.
Aims
We will partner with scientists across the US, Africa, and the UK to build an unprecedented
resource, the SAMBAI Biobank and Data Repository for Cancer Equity Research. We will
generate a comprehensive, accurate, and relevant measurement of social, environmental,
genetic, and immunological factors to complete an integrated set of analyses to define the causal
vs. modifier relationships of disparate outcomes in diverse underserved populations. We will
establish a sustainable framework for team science approaches with under-represented partners
and establish best practices for coordinating cancer equity research on a global scale.
Methods
We propose to utilize multiple methods across our different work packages. Social Determinants
include self-reporting surveys and database abstractions. Exposomes utilize mass spectrometry
of plasma. Genomics will utilize three sequencing methods on germline and tumor tissue,
including long read, short/deep, and ultra-low pass whole genome sequencing. Lastly,
immunological profiles will be measured with spatial transcriptomics and circulating multiplex
immunoassays. These data require novel computational frameworks, including cloud-based
virtualization and the use of machine learning technologies to identify novel associations across
the strata of social to spatial data elements and across our diverse geographic and ancestral
SAMBAI cohorts.
Utility and Impact
We will improve research capacity in under-resourced environments for large-scale cancer
research and equitable access to data with equitable feasibility to improve treatment and
outcomes. We will define interactions of environmental exposures, social determinants, and
genetic ancestry that determine immunological landscapes of primary tumors and/or circulating
immunological profiles in patients of African descent. Our project will contribute a data repository
with 100K features/patient, for 40,000 patients. The impact on this population includes a novel
trial design, in collaboration with our patient advocacy partners, to ensure that the specific
genomic and immunological features we uncover become part of targeted precision oncology

RUSTBELT CFAR Uganda Core C is a state-of-the-art laboratory with cutting-edge technology that meets the
demands of modern-day HIV research into cures, pathogenesis, co-morbidities, and co-infections. The Core is
central to the research collaboration between Makerere University (MU), located in Kampala Uganda, the
RUSTBELT CFAR and its partner hospitals and institutions. Through the ""Microbiology and Immunology
Training for HIV and HIV-Related Research in Uganda” (MITHU, D43 TW010319, PI: Boom), we have
established a robust pipeline of Ugandan Ph.D. students at CWRU. Historically, our Ph.D. graduates have moved
on to become faculty members at MU or have research positions at JCRC. Unfortunately, many of our
outstanding students have uncertain futures because of a lack of resources in Uganda. To address this
challenge, the “RUSTBELT CFAR Ugandan Faculty Development Program” will engage the infrastructure and
outstanding laboratory facilities available through the RUSTBELT CFAR to support and mentor Ugandan
investigators returning to the country. We have modeled this effort on the NIH “Path to Independence” awards
but include enhanced mentorship and travel to tailor the program to conditions in Uganda. We will also support
Clinical Fellows entering HIV clinical research. Each “RUSTBELT CFAR Ugandan Faculty Development
Program” participant will have joint Ugandan and CFAR mentors. The mentoring relationship will be specified
in a written mentoring agreement that clearly defines the responsibilities of each party. Typically, there will be
focused monthly meetings with the primary mentors and semi-annual meetings with the Steering Committee to
monitor progress. For translational investigators, topics will focus primarily on HIV cure, HIV drug resistance,
and HIV-associated co-morbidities. For clinical investigators, the focus is to gain expertise in designing and
conducting clinical trials by inclusion in the operations of the Case and Pitt Clinical Trials Units (CTU) and JCRC
Clinical Research Site (CRS), and International AIDS Clinical Trials Unit in Kampala (AI 069501, PIs
Jacobson (CWRU, Core D co-Director) Kityo (JCRC)). Support for faculty development in Uganda will not
simply be restricted to Core C activities in Uganda since the entire CFAR clinical and laboratory infrastructure
will be used to support technology transfer and promote research with our Ugandan colleagues. We have
included annual working visits to the US to promote technology transfer, advanced training, and expansion of
collaborative activities. By leveraging the resources available through the RUSTBELT CFAR, this unique initiative
will substantially ameliorate the chronic underrepresentation of translational and clinical researchers from low-
and middle-income countries and enhance the diversity of investigators focusing on HIV-focused clinical and
translational studies."
11043879,"ABSTRACT
During a recent single cell RNA sequencing analysis of the developing human lung, we identified a cell
population characterized by a unique gene expression profile that has not previously been reported in the
human or mouse lung. These cells express SCGB3A2/SFTPB/CFTR, but lack markers for other well
characterized cell types such as club cells (SCGB1A1) or ionocytes (FOXI1). We refer to these as Fetal Airway
Secretory (FAS) cells given the expression of several secretory genes within the transcriptional signature.
Since nothing is known about FAS cells, and there is no analogous population in the murine lung, the
overarching goal of this proposal is to both describe these cells in detail, to interrogate their differentiation
potential, and to determine how these cells are regulated. By using an in vitro model of the developing human
lung epithelium called human Bud Tip Progenitor (BTP)-organoids, preliminary data shows that BTP-organoids
can give rise to both TP63+ progenitors and FAS cells during airway differentiation, and that this differentiation
can be modulated by TGFb/BMP/SMAD signaling. Single cell barcode-based lineage tracing during the
transition from BTP-to-airway suggest that clones of FAS cells or basal cells give rise to distinct subsets of
airway cells, with FAS cells giving rise to pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs) and a subset of C6+
multiciliated (MC) cells, while TP63+ progenitor cells give rise to secretory cells and MUC16+ MC cells. Based
on this data, we will test the overarching hypothesis that FAS cells differentiate distinct airway progenitor cell
that give rise to a subset of airway cell types. Given the novelty of this cell type, and the unique tools that we
have developed to assess the differentiating human epithelium in vitro, understanding this cell population will
provide foundational descriptive and mechanistic insights into human lung biology."
11044020,"Despite a wide-ranging interest in performing clinical research for bioelectronic medicine applications, there are
no available open-architecture and open-source implantable systems for autonomic nerve stimulation and
recording. As a result, clinical researchers face significant technical, regulatory, and financial hurdles in getting
access to the implantable neuromodulation technologies that are required for performing these clinical studies.
There are several clinical closed-loop implantable neuromodulation systems presently available and they have
been helpful in supporting clinical research. However, in their current form, none are suitable for the bioelectronic
medicine applications, as they lack key modules for accessing the autonomic nerves; moreover, many of them
use closed architectures.
 To address this challenge, we propose to develop the implantable leads for the implantable pulse generator
(IPG) platform, which will be based on a flexible, open-architecture, and modular approach. A large selection of
stimulation and sensing leads will be developed for interfacing with the IPG header. Specifically, we will develop
a polydimethylsiloxane-based cuff for stimulation of autonomic nerves with the diameter of 1 mm and larger. We
will also develop a lead for sacral nerve stimulation. For enabling closed-loop neuromodulation, we will develop
the leads for electrocardiographic, electromyographic, electroneurographic, and accelerometer-based motility
sensing. Such flexibility and modularity will allow a significant degree of customization for different clinical
indications, including open-loop and closed-loop IPG operation. Once the implantable leads are developed, they
will be subjected to the benchtop testing."
11048013,"The primary goal of our parent study, the Adolescent Suicide Prevention in Routine clinical Encounters
(ASPIRE) trial, is to compare the effectiveness of an electronic health record (EHR) nudge alone to an EHR
nudge plus facilitation with respect to delivery of a secure firearm storage program during pediatric well-child
visits. We captured clinician-reported reach in the EHR for the entire patient population (~45,000 visits) and
obtained fidelity (i.e., parent-reported receipt of the program) from a subset of parents with whom we engaged
in an intensive sampling approach to collect a post-visit survey. Reach was documented by clinicians for a
large sample of patients and therefore does not suffer from the potential non-response bias that may affect
parent-reported fidelity. However, reach may suffer from measurement error if clinicians incorrectly reported
program delivery or exited out of the EHR prompt without responding to the questions. The proposed aims of
this supplement will develop statistical methods to combine information contained in each outcome (reach,
fidelity), effectively mitigating their respective limitations. The proposed methods will offer a powerful statistical
analysis tool for comparing the effectiveness of the implementation strategies using multiple sources of data
from a cluster randomized trial like ASPIRE. In Aim 1, we will derive a statistical estimator for comparing
interventions in a two-arm cluster randomized trial to addresses non-response bias in survey-based fidelity by
leveraging the large, complete sample provided by EHR-based reach, the latter of which may be subject to
measurement error. We will also propose methods to obtain p-values and confidence intervals for the
comparison of study arms. The methods will account for correlation due to inherent clustering of outcomes
(patients within providers within clinics) while controlling Type I error and maximizing power to detect a
difference between study arms. In Aim 2, we will use simulation studies to assess the statistical properties of
the proposed estimator and inferential methods (i.e., p-values, confidence intervals). We will study bias,
variability, Type I error, power, and coverage of 95% confidence intervals using simulations across a range of
design factors such as the level of parent non-response in fidelity, amount of measurement error in reach,
magnitude of the treatment effect, and intra-cluster correlation. In Aim 3, we will apply the proposed methods to
data from ASPIRE. We will apply our methodology to jointly analyze parent-reported fidelity and EHR-based
reach from the active implementation period of the ASPIRE trial. The methodology developed within our
supplemental work will provide increased accuracy and precision in analyses of important implementation
outcomes collected as part of the ASPIRE trial and will offer a new analytic framework for future cluster
randomized trials in implementation science."

After accounting for potential confounders such as age, sex, and smoking, HIV has been identified as an independent risk
factor for lung cancer. Lung cancer (adenocarcinoma) emerging as the primary cause of cancer-related deaths in
individuals with HIV. HIV+ individuals diagnosed with lung cancer typically exhibit limited survival and disease-free survival,
and poor quality of life with additional clinical complications associated with chem/radio therapies. Therefore, research
endeavors to discover mechanisms responsible for worse prognosis of lung cancer in HIV+ individuals, will significantly
impact patient lives. A common belief is that HIV patients have damage specifically to immune cells in the
microenvironments. Within the TME from HIV+ tumors, there is a comparable level of infiltration of lymphocytes and
tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) compared to non-HIV tumors. A comprehensive examination of data reveals
distinctive features of a modified tumor microenvironment (TME) in HIV-positive lung cancer patients, exhibiting
compromised anti-tumor responses. We aim to identify the cellular, transcriptomic, and mechanistic changes in tumor
microenvironment (TME) cells of the HIV+ lung cancer (LC) affected individuals. We have collected unique set of non-HIV
and HIV+ LC samples from patients and their normal lung tissue samples. These samples are distributed for males and
females, less than 60 and more than 60 years of age, and matched for comorbidities, which helps us understand
mechanistic differences in the transcriptome of TME cells in relation with HIV+ and non-HIV status. Our lab published a
seminal article with Nature, which demonstrated that competitive and non-cell autonomous interactions between the
cancer cells and the various cell types in the TME is a key process which defines oncogenic fate during early and late stages
of cancer, including the metastatic probabilities. Our high impact demonstrates the role of competitive and non-cell
autonomous interactions on cellular fate of tumor microenvironment cells in lung cancer. And there is evidence of
competitive interactions and Flower Win and Lose system is found in the TME of LC samples. We propose key role of non-
cell autonomous and competitive interactions in the formation of non-responsive and immunosuppressive TME in HIV+
LC patients. Our aims are to perform ultra-high resolution spatial transcriptomics on non-HIV and HIV+ lung cancer samples
with age <60 and >60 years. And to use ultra-high resolution spatial transcriptomics to decipher competitive and non-cell
autonomous mechanisms which regulate the fate of the tumor microenvironment and cancer cells in HIV+ lung cancer
samples."
11045158,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Age-related heart valve disease is the 3rd leading cause of cardiovascular disease and is especially prevalent
among the elderly. Studies have shown that degenerative aortic valve disease affects over 25% of people over
65 years of age, and eventually leads to calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD). There is no effective medical
therapy that modifies the progression of CAVD. CAVD is believed to be primarily driven by the valve interstitial
cells (VICs). Briefly, when these normally quiescent VICs become ‘activated’ via unknown mechanisms, they
become myofibroblasts and express smooth muscle α–actin and cadherin-11 (CDH11). We have generated
robust evidence over the past decade to advance CDH11 as a prime candidate for CAVD therapy. Our
hypothesis is that CDH11 is the mechanobiological driver of the majority of cases of CAVD and that targeting it
can halt the progression and possibly reverse CAVD. Therefore, we propose three aims to advance targeting of
CDH11 for treatment of CAVD. Aim 1: Clarify the cell-cell-specific mechanism of CDH11 engagement that leads
to CAVD. Aim 2: Determine if targeting CDH11 can halt or reverse AS progression. Aim 3: Evaluate circulating
CDH11 as a biomarker to identify interventional timing in AS patients. At the conclusion of these aims, we will
have clarified the precise cell-cell interaction by which CDH11 drives CAVD, established if targeting CDH11 after
the development of CAVD can halt or reverse the pathology, and determined if circulating CDH11 can be used
as a biomarker in the progression of AS to guide a future clinical trial."
11043819,"Chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP) is a major healthcare burden, affecting nearly 20% of patients undergoing major surgery. CPSP is associated with diminished quality of life, mood disturbances, functional impairment, and increases the risk of opioid use disorder. Considerable research suggests that a combination of somatosensory, immune, affective and cognitive mechanisms contribute to CPSP, and that CPSP phenotypes are highly heterogeneous, even after identical surgical procedures. However, most prior research has explored peripheral or central mechanisms in isolation, preventing an integrated insight into underlying biological factors that drive these distinct clinical phenotypes. Preclinical models of CSPS have also failed to capture this phenotypic heterogeneity or meaningful clinical outcome measures, significantly limiting forward translation of basic discoveries. As a result, current strategies for predicting, preventing and treating CPSP are extremely limited. To address this need, we have developed the IMPETUS program that draws expertise from pain neurobiology, clinical pain research, clinical psychology, cognitive neuroscience, immunology, proteomics, genomics, transcriptomics, bioinformatics, machine learning, and pain medicine. Our goal is to gain integrated mechanistic insights into peripheral and central biological processes that contribute to CPSP, and to understand how these processes contribute to CPSP heterogeneity. Aim 1. Characterize peripheral neural and immune mechanisms contributing to CPSP. In patients with CPSP subsequent to abdominal or genitourinary surgery (n=220) and contemporaneous controls (n=100), we will characterize somatosensory profiles of mechanical and thermal sensitivity, the neural and immune milieu at the cutaneous site of injury, and circulating immune host profiles, and compare them with correlates across the same domains in a mouse model of laparotomy. Aim 2. Characterize cognitive and affective mechanisms contributing to CPSP. In patients with CPSP and controls, we will use granular longitudinal data collection methods to characterize affective, cognitive, and activity/sleep measures of CPSP, and compare them with animal model correlates across these domains, using translational outputs of amotivation, punishment-sensitivity, reversal learning task, and actigraphy. Aim 3. Identify and back-translate mechanism-based CPSP phenotypes. Using state-of-the-art machine learning approaches applied to multidimensional data generated in Aims 1 and 2, we will identify discrete CPSP phenotypes, and recapitulate them in animal models for improved translatability. We expect the IMPETUS program to 1) identify distinct somatosensory, neural, immune, affective and cognitive mechanisms that contribute to distinct CPSP phenotypes and explain inter-patient heterogeneity, with cross-species validation; 2) Characterize distinct phenotypic clusters within CPSP to inform personalized patient care and stratified clinical trials for CPSP interventions; and 3) Develop animal models that recapitulate specific clinical phenotypes of CPSP to accelerate for mechanistic exploration and novel therapeutic development."

11040422,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Low back pain (LBP) is a leading cause of disability worldwide with an estimated 40% of LBP attributed to
degenerating intervertebral discs (IVD), frequently referred to as discogenic LBP. Many of the current
preclinical models of discogenic LBP impose focal injury with rapid onset and are typically limited to 1 or 2
IVDs. In contrast, in clinical discogenic LBP, IVDs degenerate over a long period of time creating pain-
generating tissue states during this progressive process. The overall objective for this application is to develop
a clinically representative preclinical model of discogenic LBP that recapitulates the human discogenic LBP
biological processes, making it more likely to aid in the development of novel therapies to reduce or stop the
pain. In our prior work with a mouse lacking the SPARC gene (a structural protein in IVDs and other tissues),
we demonstrated that this preclinical model leads to IVD degeneration replicating human discogenic LBP.
While these mice demonstrate healthy behavior, removing the SPARC gene from the entire body leads to off-
target effects. As an example, the eyes and brains have atypical features. We therefore propose to develop
and validate an inducible, disc-specific SPARC deletion model using Cre/LoxP which would retain the clinical
discogenic LBP phenotype while also ensuring normal development of all of the other tissues in the body.
Aim 1 (R61, Year 1&2): Optimize the crossbreeding protocol(s) and induction timing to reproduce the
behavioral, radiographic, and cellular/molecular facets of clinical discogenic LBP. Our working
hypothesis is that crossing SPARC-floxed mice with tamoxifen‐inducible cytokeratin 19 mice (Krt19-CreERT;
targets nucleus pulposus (NP) cells) and/or with tamoxifen-inducible aggrecan mice (Agc1-CreERT2; targets
all components of IVDs) will lead to a clinically representative discogenic LBP model. We will induce
recombination in utero and at skeletal maturity to initiate IVD degeneration and test for signs of low back pain.
Milestones: Demonstration of IVD degeneration and pain phenotype. If multiple models meet the criteria, the
model with the latest induction time and the most favorable off-site recombination profile will be selected.
Aim 2 (R33, Year 3): Validate the behavioral phenotype and determine responsiveness to
pharmacological intervention. Our working hypothesis is that axial pain will be sensitive to morphine,
pregabalin and ibuprofen while radiating pain will only respond to pregabalin.
Aim 3 (R33, Year 3): Independent replication. Concurrent to Aim 2, an independent lab at University of New
England will perform the same procedures as described in Aim 2.
These results will have an important positive impact because there is a need for a clinically representative
discogenic LBP preclinical model for the discovery and validation of novel non-addictive therapeutics."

The overarching goal of this supplement request for R35 GM128618 is to support Jasmine Walsh, a promising
PhD candidate from an under-represented group, in her research training in the PI’s laboratory. Specifically,
Jasmine is studying gut bacterial metabolism of endogenous steroid hormones. The Devlin lab has been studying
gut bacterial conversion of glucocorticoids, metabolites that regulate immune function and metabolism, into
progestins, metabolites that are neurosteroids and sex hormones. Jasmine will contribute to these efforts by
identifying gut bacteria and bacterial enzymes that produce progesterone (P4), tetrahydroprogesterones (THPs),
and 11β-hydroxy tetrahydroprogesterones (11β-OH THPs). She will also investigate the in vivo relevance of
these findings by exploring whether gut bacteria produce these compounds in specific pathogen-free and
gnotobiotic pregnant and non-pregnant female mice. Finally, she will characterize the effects of progestin
metabolites on progesterone receptor (PR) signaling in vitro. This supplement will provide Jasmine with rigorous
training in biochemistry, analytical chemistry, microbiology, cell culture, and mouse studies in the context of the
microbiome field. In addition, the career development plan supported by this supplement will act as a springboard
for Jasmine to progress to the next stage of her scientific career and will help her advance toward her ultimate
goal, which is running her own laboratory. The proposed supplement will enhance the goals of the parent R35
while advancing the NIH mission for enhancing diversity."

Rural outcomes following high acuity, low occurrence (HALO) conditions are suboptimal. During
resuscitation of neonates, a HALO event, rapid access to appropriately equipped and trained medical
personnel capable of delivering time-sensitive medical interventions is essential, or the consequences
are dire, including mortality and significant morbidity. The Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP®), a
national guideline and training program, designed to standardize care and improve adherence to care
algorithms, is delivered every two years. However, knowledge and technical skills involved in
adherence to best practices typically degrade over two to three months if the skills are not used
clinically. For high-volume, urban teaching hospitals, there is sufficient volume to maintain skills. For
lower volume rural and community hospitals, there is a lack of opportunities to maintain skills,
including Maine, where neonatal resuscitation is a true HALO event with the vast majority of hospitals
delivering less than one infant a day and very few newborns needing any resuscitation. High volume
centers across various populations have better outcomes, and in emergencies, patients in lower
volume centers experience higher rates of medication errorsand differences in adherence to care
algorithms. Studies estimate that 20-40% of neonatal lives could be saved with proper neonatal
resuscitation and are dependent upon a rapid, knowledgeable, and skillful response. There is an
urgent need to increase rural community hospital readiness and solutions to improve neonatal HALO
related care delivery. The overall goal of the parent grant, the NIH COBRE in Acute Care Research
and Rural Disparities, is to support and develop strategies to reduce health disparities due to rurality.
This supplement grant proposal seeks to decrease the healthcare disparities experienced by rural
patients by targeting team-based performance training for neonatal resuscitation. We aim to conduct
a pilot crossover study comparing team performance in NRP®, teamwork, and communication skills
with HoloBabyTM (a novel mixed reality neonatal manikin prototype) and HiFi manikin simulation. We
will compare team performance in simulations using HoloBabyTM and HiFi training. Simulations will be
video recorded and investigators will rate NRP® adherence, teamwork, and communication using
standardized scoring tools. We hypothesize teams’ performance with the different simulation
technologies will be equivalent. We also aim to evaluate the psychometric properties of the modified
NRP® adherence assessment tool. We will use data collected in Aim 1, in addition to existing
assessment data, to examine estimates of reliability and validity for the NRP® assessment tool. We
hypothesize the modified NRP® assessment tool is a sufficiently valid and reliable tool for measuring
team performance in the simulated environment and will not differ according to simulator type.
To achieve our proposed aims, a diverse skill set, expertise, and team approach will be essential.
This project aims to leverage simulation expertise, including the neonatal simulation expertise of Drs.
Zanno and Melendi and the pediatric simulation experience of Dr. Mallory. The project will utilize
simulation expertise through the Hannaford Center for Safety, Innovation, and Simulation (HCSIS), a
high throughput simulation center for MaineHealth that reaches approximately 5,000 clinicians per
year across Maine. Dr. Strout has extensive training and experience in the conduct of clinical and
educational research across the lifespan, which includes qualitative, quantitative, and mixed
methodologies as well as psychometrics and measure development and evaluation. Together, this
team is poised to successfully achieve the aims proposed here, advancing scientific understanding in
this area and improving neonatal care delivery in rural communities."

11045352,"PROJECT SUMMARY (Parent R01)
Building comprehensive accounts of human brain development from childhood to early
adulthood is crucial to our understanding of both healthy neurodevelopment and the
mechanisms underlying threats to youths’ mental health. Brain development unfolds on multiple
levels, but the field lacks a comprehensive understanding of whether the trajectories of
development are fundamentally similar or different across modalities (e.g., structure and
function), and how they reflect developmental mechanisms associated with puberty or age (or
both). The proposed research aims to generate a systematic and comprehensive multimodal
account of typical neurodevelopment from ages 5 to 21, with a particular focus on a) identifying
age versus pubertal- and hormonal-based mechanisms that undergird development in childhood
and adolescence; b) systematic analyses across brain structure, function, and connectivity
using state-of-the-art acquisition and analysis approaches; and c) evaluation of maturational
variation in multimodal coupling across brain systems/modalities as a function of development.
Once established, this multimodal model of typical neurodevelopment will be used to test a
conceptual model proposing that early pubertal timing leads to intensification of internalizing
symptoms due to disruptions in brain development, including alterations in multimodal coupling.
Specifically, models of the impact of early pubertal timing predict either further enhanced
coupling with early puberty (neurodevelopmental acceleration) or disruptions in coupling due to
neurodevelopmental delays. To compare these competing models and advance our
understanding of the neurodevelopmental pathways by which early pubertal timing contributes
to the rise of internalizing symptoms during adolescence, the research will use both hypothesis-
driven methods and novel validated analysis pipelines for data-driven exploration of
developmental changes in coupling, with careful attention to robustness and replication. The
primary dataset will be the Human Connectome Project in Development (HCPD), a large, NIH
funded, multimodal brain imaging dataset that includes a comprehensive assessment of brain
structure, function, and connectivity paired with pubertal and hormonal measures and extensive
behavioral and clinical measures in both a cross-sectional cohort of N=1300+ youth ages 5 to
21, and a longitudinal cohort (N=252) spanning ages 9 to 17 capturing the pubertal transition.
This sample is purposefully strong diversity in race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Key
findings will be replicated to ensure robustness and generalizability in the Adolescent Brain and
Cognitive Development (ABCD) longitudinal study. Our Specific Aims are to: A1) Establish a
comprehensive, systematic account of age-and pubertal-linked pathways of brain development
across multiple modalities of brain structure and function; A2) Test hypotheses about the
relations of age and pubertal development to coupling across brain modalities; and A3) Test
hypotheses about the neurodevelopmental mechanisms contributing to the rise in internalizing
symptoms during the pubertal transition."

 For the first phase of our CoBRE award, we are aiming to develop infrastructure and expertise base, as
well as to build a critical mass of funded investigators for translational auditory and vestibular research.
Towards these goals, three groups led by Drs. Litao Tao, Justine Renauld, and Jun Xia respectively, will
collaborate to conduct a preliminary study of Ménière’s Disease, one debilitating disease affecting millions of
people.
 Ménière’s Disease (MD), characterized by fluctuating hearing loss and vertigo, is a poorly understood
disease for which the etiology is still unknown. While the pathophysiology of MD remains to be discovered, it is
believed that this disorder arises from endolymph homeostasis imbalance. Endolymphatic hydrops, an
enlargement of the membranous labyrinth in the inner ear, is a hallmark of the disease. To gain better
understanding of this complex disease, this collaborative effort aims to look at 3 synergic ways to uncover the
development of MD and endolymphatic hydrops. In this project, we will (1) Identify and validate genetic
variants associated with MD from the whole genome sequencing data of more than 1300 patients suffering
from MD; (2) characterize the transcriptional changes of an endolymphatic hydrops mouse model’s lateral wall,
which is essential for endolymph production and regulation; and (3) identify the distal enhancers by epigenetic
study to correlate potential non-coding hot spots from the genetic variant highlighted in Aim 1 with the
functional genes affected in the lateral wall discovered in Aim 2. We believe this project with multiple
approaches will not only provide new insight into the pathogenesis of MD, but also improve our understanding
of lateral wall function and regulation which will have a significant impact for the development of future targeted
treatments for MD therapy but also other strial disorders.
 This supplemental award project aligns with the goal of our CoBRE award. Through collaborations,
three teams can learn from each other and will gain new expertise together for studies of strial functions and
disorders. Results from this preliminary study will lay the foundation to further investigate the molecular
mechanisms of MD and to explore potential treatment options. As junior faculties, Drs. Tao, Renauld and Xia
will seek funding through NIH or private foundations to support their future studies on MD."
11044021,"Implanted leads are critical for direct interfaces to the peripheral nervous system and have been used clinically
since the 1960s. Even so, no open-architecture or open-source leads are available for autonomic nerve
stimulation and recording. This is especially a problem for interfacing with soft, small diameter nerves measuring
1 mm or less. Since these are of great interest as targets in bioelectronic medicine, NEST 4 will introduce a new
open-architecture nerve interface based on a helical cuff format. This cuff addresses the limitations of
downscaling traditional materials and fabrication methods for polydimethylsiloxane-based cuffs and instead
adopts a different scheme to achieve practical nerve cuffs using a composite Parylene C-PDMS structure.
 The CARSS helical microfabricated cuff uses soft polymers and thin film electrodes to achieve a miniaturized
cuff form factor. The contra-rotational helical cuff design is achieved by post-processing the Parylene electrode
array using a thermoforming process to achieve the final three-dimensional shape. The helical design is self-
sizing and self-closing which avoids the need for sutures. The cuff is accompanied by a minimally invasive,
custom endoscopic tool that will simplify surgery and allow access to deeper autonomic nerve branches.
 In NEST 4, the Parylene helical cuff will be developed, benchtop tested, and demonstrated with the surgical
placement tool, paving the way for a widely accessible cuff for smaller nerves in clinical bioelectronic medicine
research."
11045293,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Sarcoidosis is a multi-organ, immune-mediated inflammatory disease with a highly variable clinical presentation
and disease course. Additionally, the mortality rate from sarcoidosis appears to be rising over the past decades.
A significant challenge in the management of sarcoidosis is the lack of reliable diagnostic and prognostic
biomarkers. The objective of this project is to define microRNAs (miRNAs) that can be used as diagnostic
biomarkers and to associate miRNA expression with clinical characteristics in sarcoidosis for the development
of prognostic biomarkers.
A genomic approach to biomarker development is well suited for complex, polygenetic diseases such as
sarcoidosis and will be the focus of this project. miRNAs have significant potential as biomarkers in sarcoidosis
given their role as epigenetic modifiers and immune response regulators. Prior to this grant, we performed
miRNA sequencing on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cell samples in a discovery cohort comprised of sarcoidosis
cases and healthy controls; this process identified 7 differentially expressed miRNAs, which we will use in all the
aims of this current proposal. In Aim 1, we will validate the 7 differentially expressed miRNAs in a validation
cohort comprised of cases, healthy controls, and interstitial lung disease controls. The miRNAs that are validated
will then be tested as a diagnostic biomarker for sarcoidosis. In Aim 2, we determine if the expression levels of
the 7 differentially expressed miRNAs at the time of BAL reflect clinical manifestations of sarcoidosis. We will
also determine if the miRNA expression levels at the time of BAL can predict changes in clinical manifestations
over two years. Finally, in Aim 3, we will characterize the stability of the 7 differentially expressed miRNAs over
two years in a subset of sarcoidosis cases. This finding, along with the results from Aim 2, will help in the
development of prognostic biomarkers in a future grant.
This proposal will provide a strong foundation for Dr. Lin’s long-term goal of becoming an independently funded
physician-scientist in the field of translational sarcoidosis and environmental/occupational pulmonary research.
Specifically, this proposal will continue to build her expertise in genomic biomarker development, longitudinal
study design, and statistical analyses specific to sarcoidosis research. This proposal will also generate
preliminary data for her future R01 grant submissions."

11042329,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) are rare, devasting disorders arising from pathogenic variants in genes
encoding enzymes of key biochemical pathways. The liver plays an important role in the pathogenesis of over
150 IEMs, often failing to metabolize a toxic metabolite that can injure secondary organs, such as brain. Liver
transplantation is employed in some IEMs; however, its utility is limited by scarcity of donors and lifelong risk of
post-transplant complications. To address the unmet medical need of IEM patients, we aim to develop a master
protocol for the rapid development of personalized prime-editing therapies for severe, rare hepatic IEMs.
We envision a platform regulatory framework where IND-enabling studies for a “leader” hepatic IEM prime-editing
therapy also support programs for varied “follower” indications. The leader and follower therapies will differ only
in patient-variant-specific guide RNA sequences. For our leader indication, we have selected phenylketonuria
(PKU). In PKU, an autosomal recessive disorder, impaired phenylalanine (Phe) catabolism in the liver induces
neurotoxic Phe accumulation. In our proof-of-concept studies, a single dose of an AAV8-based, R408W prime-
editing therapy completely and durably normalized Phe levels in humanized PKU R408W mice.
We will leverage our PKU R408W IND-enabling studies to accelerate development for our follower indications:
ultra-rare, severe, neonatal urea cycle disorders (UCDs) and organic acidemias (OAs) that affect ≈1:20,000
births. Neonates with UCDs or OAs present with severe toxic accumulation of ammonia and/or organic acids.
While liver transplantation can improve metabolic control, patients must grow to an appropriate size to receive a
transplant. During this wait, most patients experience irreversible neurologic damage and episodes of life-
threatening metabolic decompensation. We seek to develop just-in-time, personalized, liver-directed prime-
editing therapies addressing the pathogenic variants identified through newborn screening at our large referral
center. A platform regulatory approach is essential to develop therapies in time to meaningfully improve
outcomes in this patient cohort who typically suffer significant early morbidity and mortality.
Our primary objectives are to (1) establish a therapeutic platform, comprising a single prime editor and AAV
delivery system, for numerous hepatic IEMs, and (2) streamline approvals through regulatory innovation,
informed by stakeholder input and disseminated to the scientific community."
11045859,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Social media (SM) has played an increasingly prominent role in adolescents’ daily lives over the past decade, notably
coinciding with increased population prevalence of major depressive disorder and eating disorders among adolescents.
Correlational research consistently links greater time spent on SM with depressive symptoms and body dissatisfaction,
which are prevalent and distressing mental health symptoms that can develop into psychopathology. Social comparison
may be one central mechanism explaining associations of SM use with depressive symptoms and body dissatisfaction.
Adolescents may compare themselves to idealized versions of others on SM, ruminate (i.e., perseverate on self-relevant
thoughts) on the discrepancy between their real and ideal selves, and feel dissatisfied with their lives and bodies as a
result. Previous research has been mostly limited to cross-sectional investigations of social comparison on a single SM
platform, with SM use measured simply in terms of time spent using SM. While SM use may cause depressive
symptoms and body dissatisfaction, experiencing mental health symptoms may also cause specific SM activities known
to decrease well-being, such as passive scrolling and comparison to distant acquaintances or strangers. Individual
characteristics (e.g., personality traits, sociodemographic characteristics) may be risk or protective factors influencing
reciprocal relationships between SM use and mental health symptoms. Nuanced measures of SM use and correlates
of use that move beyond “time spent on SM” are needed to understand which specific SM activities (e.g., active vs.
passive use, viewing content from friends vs. strangers) put adolescents at greatest risk for mental health symptoms,
so that these factors can be targeted in future prevention and intervention campaigns. This proposal will examine
bidirectional influences of adolescents’ SM activity and individual characteristics on depressive symptoms and body
dissatisfaction through the lens of social comparison theory. In this longitudinal observational study, N=120 U.S.
adolescents aged 13-18 who report daily SM use will be recruited for an ecological momentary assessment (EMA)
study with two 14-day EMA bursts over 2 months. Using a smartphone app, participants will be prompted to complete
2 randomly scheduled surveys each day to: a) send screenshots depicting recent SM activity that prompted social
comparison, b) respond to survey items to provide context for the screenshots, and c) report recent social comparisons,
depressive symptoms, and body dissatisfaction. Specific aims are to: 1) characterize SM activity that prompts social
comparison among adolescents; 2) examine within-day and day-to-day associations between SM activity, social
comparison intensity, and mental health symptoms, and 3) identify individual characteristics most strongly associated
with SM activity and mental health symptoms. This proposal will identify risk and protective factors linking SM use to
mental health symptoms, which may serve as modifiable targets in future intervention development. This research is
urgently needed to understand how the modern SM environment affects adolescents’ mental health and who is most at
risk."
11043520,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):
In this proposal, we develop new interpretable statistical methodology to advance medical genetic, which
seeks to understand the genetic basis of complex diseases and to identify disease-causing gene
mutations. Since genes typically act through modules and pathways in modulating cellular functions, a
standard approach in medical genetics is to follow candidate gene identification from patient data with an
analysis of the network formed by interactions of these candidate genes. The question of how to best
utililize gene-gene interaction (GGI) network information to uncover disease genes constitutes an urgent
bottleneck in medical genetics research, and our goal is to provide a statistical approach to this problem.
Our proposed research is to model gene-gene interactions as a Markovian network, which takes into
account the latent growth process of a network. Markovian models are especially suitable for GGI
networks because new gene interactions arise through evolution over time. We propose four distinct but
highly inter-related projects: (1) we propose a general Markovian network model for GGI networks that
encompass various existing models as special cases; (2) we propose a flexible method based on the repro
samples framework to construct confidence sets for the central root nodes of a Markovian network, which
can be used to identify disease genes on GGI networks with rigorous frequentist significance guarantees,
a task that was not possible or easily achieved in the past; (3) We propose an innovative development to
incorporate community/module structure into Markovian networks and devise novel methods to estimate
the functional modules and hidden gene nodes of a given GGI network; and (4) we give concrete plans to
validate our methods and any empirical findings we obtain using criteria common in bioinformatics and
laboratory experiments. Our research agenda has the potential to transform both medical genetics and
foundational statistical research. The Pl team comprises statisticians and geneticist with expertise in
network analysis, statistical inference, medical genetics, machine learning and it is ideally suitted to
conduct the proposed research. Successful completion of this research is expected to introduce and
validate a new and powerful strategy for understanding the genetic etiology of complex diseases. The
proposed work will also greatly expand the reach of statistical inference and uncertainty quantification, and
fundamentally impact our approach of making inference for many problems in data science."
11044247,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Neonatal hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is the most common cause of cerebral palsy in children born
at term. Affected children are also at significantly increased risk of learning disorders, intellectual disability,
ADHD and Autism and these neurodevelopmental impairments can result in lifelong disability. HIE can be
caused by any condition that impairs blood or oxygen delivery to the fetal brain around the time of birth,
including maternal infection or inflammation, placental insufficiency/abruption, chorioamnionitis, among other
factors. Therapeutic hypothermia is currently the only effective therapy for HIE, however, 40-50% of infants die
or have moderate to severe neurodevelopmental disability despite undergoing this therapy. Furthermore, many
affected infants are not offered this therapy due to the narrow time window to initiate this treatment after birth.
Therefore, it is critical to develop a complete understanding of the mechanisms of injury to develop novel or
augmentative therapeutic agents.
Many infants with neonatal encephalopathy, the clinical indicator of cerebral insult that allows infants to
undergo therapeutic hypothermia, are born to mothers with evidence of systemic inflammation (i.e., maternal
fever, chorioamnionitis, viral infection), or they themselves have signs of inflammation (i.e. fever, elevated
WBC count) at the time of birth. This systemic inflammation is not recapitulated in current rodent models of HIE
that rely solely on hypoxic or ischemic insults. Therefore, we developed a novel mouse model of HIE (dual hit
HIE model) that incorporates maternal immune activation (MIA) with deep hypoxia at term equivalence.
Preliminary data demonstrate reduced motor coordination, time to find escape route (Barnes maze) and
reduced grip strength in adult mice. We propose to leverage this promising novel mouse model of HIE for
further investigation of the mechanisms of maternal immune activation and modulation of neonatal
neuroinflammation. Moreover, the model lends itself well to investigating a variety of questions related to brain-
immune function, necessary to understand how the brain and microglia respond to immune activation, how the
brain communicates with peripheral immune molecules and pathogens, and identify novel approaches that
might allow for the selective immunomodulation of microglia in the brain or periphery that could very easily
apply to a variety of neurological disorders or disease states."

Right ventricular remodeling leads to serious complications in congenital heart disease. Congenital
heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect. Due to improved diagnostics and surgery, 1 million
patients live in the US with CHD, many of whom develop right ventricular (RV) heart failure. Our understanding
of the underlying pathobiology and therapies are very limited, creating a pressing research need. Patients with
Tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary stenosis (ToF/PS), the most common form of cyanotic CHD and the form
most available for research, develop adverse RV remodeling, leading to heart failure and arrhythmias. It has
been thought that the RV remodeling is a consequence of surgical repair. However, we have recently shown
that ToF/PS patients have decreased heart muscle cell (cardiomyocyte) division, indicating the possibility of
developing a new mechanistic paradigm of RV heart failure development in CHD.
Increased β-adrenergic receptor signaling decreases cardiomyocyte proliferation in ToF/PS. We have
taken an innovative research approach, using administration of thymidine labeled with a stable isotope tag
(15N-thymidine). Proliferating cells incorporate 15N-thymidine into their DNA, which we visualize with Multi-
isotope Imaging Mass Spectrometry (MIMS) analysis of pieces of RV myocardium. By detecting
cardiomyocytes labeled with 15N-thymidine, MIMS revealed decreased cardiomyocyte division in ToF/PS. Our
mechanistic investigations showed that overactive β-adrenergic receptor signaling inhibits cardiomyocyte
division. Our pre-clinical studies in neonatal mice and cardiomyocytes from ToF/PS infants demonstrate that
administration of the β-adrenergic receptor blocker propranolol increases cardiomyocyte division. β-blockers
have been used in ToF/PS, but this use has been limited to preventing hypercyanotic spells. We propose a
randomized, placebo-controlled (1:1), double-blinded, single-center clinical trial of 40 ToF/PS infants to test
the mechanistic hypothesis that β-blocker administration in ToF/PS infants increases cardiomyocyte
division and decreases RV hypertrophy. The recent success of propranolol administration in infantile
hemangiomas and American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines provide the necessary pharmacokinetics and
safety experience to support these studies in infants. As primary outcome, we will quantify cardiomyocyte
division using our innovative 15N-thymidine labeling approach with MIMS readout. As a secondary outcome, we
will characterize changes in RV and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. This initial single-center trial will provide the
foundation for future multi-center randomized controlled trials of propranolol administration in infants with
ToF/PS and other types of CHD at risk for RV remodeling, such as hypoplastic left heart syndrome, with the
long-term goal of preventing RV failure.
The Heart Institute at Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh is ideal for this research. We have achieved the
lowest mortality of infant cardiac surgery and have the research infrastructure to carry out the proposed work."

Infectious diarrhea remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children and immunocompromised
patients worldwide. However, the lack of neonatal and immunodeficient animal models that closely mirror human
infection in these highly susceptible patient groups has limited our understanding of the disease. Therefore, we
propose here the use of novel neonatal and immunodeficient mouse models of disease to study the mechanisms
of pathogenesis and host immunity during enteric and systemic infection by the pathogens Citrobacter rodentium
and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium.
Our first hypothesis is that C. rodentium employs different virulence factors to induce lethal systemic infection
in neonatal mice compared to those required for initial intestinal colonization. Specific Aim 1 was designed to
identify and characterize significant pathogen factors required for the establishment of bacteremia in neonates
using genome-wide screens and functional studies in vivo (1A-C). Specific Aim 2 will address our second
hypothesis regarding the protective role of IgG against enteric disease both in the neonatal and adult gut, and
the existence of compensatory or alternative mechanisms of pathogen eradication in the absence of IgG (2A-C).
Findings obtained with C. rodentium will be tested in the human pathogen S. Typhimurium to allow a broader
understanding of the general and specific aspects of microbial pathogenesis and host immunity during infection
in susceptible individuals (1D & 2D). These studies have high clinical significance as they may provide novel
insight into the pathogenesis of enteric and systemic disease both in children and patients with impaired adaptive
immunity, which aligns well with the goals of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).
Additionally, we have also developed a robust and comprehensive career development and training plan that
will provide scientific training in alternative models of infection, mucosal and adaptive immunity, pathology and
disease progression, high-throughput data analysis, and state-of-the-art technologies to assess cell state and
inflammatory environment in the gut. This plan will also develop and strengthen key professional skills essential
to successfully lead an independent research program, including training in mentoring and teaching, scientific
communication, networking, grant preparation, and laboratory management. A group of highly qualified and
renowned scientists will guide and evaluate the applicant’s efforts to achieve his scientific and career goals.
Altogether, the research and career development activities outlined in this proposal, along with the outstanding
institutional environment at the University of Michigan, will fully prepare the PI to pursue an independent career
in health-oriented research, positioning him as a strong junior faculty in the fields of bacterial pathogenesis, host
immunity and host-pathogen interactions."
11045128,"ABSTRACT / PROJECT SUMMARY
Despite the wide availability of the antidote naloxone, fatal opioid overdoses still occur at a rate of ~50-70,000 /
year in the US. The problem is that naloxone requires a bystander to find and diagnose the overdose, find
someone who has naloxone, and then properly administer it. Unfortunately, if this does not occur within 5
minutes, the patient will suffer from brain damage, which is often considered the “hidden epidemic” underneath
the opioid death epidemic. Additionally, ~52% of opioid overdose deaths occur when the patient is totally
alone, without nearby bystanders around.
To solve these problems, here we introduce the DOVE device, which is an armband that detects an opioid
overdose via pulse oximetry and accelerometry, and then automatically injects an antidote. Our collaboration
between industry and academia has already moved forward the DOVE technology significantly: We published
a paper showing 76% of persons who use opioids (PWUOs) (n=97) expressed a strong desire for a device like
DOVE, and showed a strong preference for an armband over many other device designs. We next
preliminarily validated the other technical challenges of DOVE: we showed our sensor’s accuracy was high on
healthy volunteers with induced hypoventilation; and our autoinjector injected reproducibly into bench-top
models of skin/fat/muscle. Additionally we validated the market, reimbursement, sales channels,
freedom-to-operate, and regulatory path.
In this STTR grant, we will optimize & test the 3 major components of DOVE (harness, sensor, and injector): In
Aim 1, we will optimize and validate the harness which keeps the device position on the deltoid muscle. We
will do this with structured interviews and observations of PWUOs interacting with each of 6 harness
prototypes. In Aim 2 we will test if the DOVE sensor can accurately detect hypoxemia in sleeping patients.
Overdose events are relatively rare, so to increase the probability of detecting hypoxia using the DOVE’s pulse
oximeter, we will apply 2 DOVE pulse-oximeter prototypes (a finger-ring, and one placed on the shoulder skin)
to 20 obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients already undergoing sleep studies. We will compare the DOVE’s
pulse oximeter and accelerometry traces vs. those of FDA-approved devices. Finally, in Aim 3 we will optimize
the DOVE auto-injector to meet the size & shape constraints specified by PWUOs, and to accurately inject into
fresh, cadaveric pigs."

Intestinal immune responses are linked to the trillions of microorganisms that colonize the gastrointestinal tract.
Thus, inter-individual variations in the gut microbiome could contribute to altered immune responses that impact
immune driven diseases such as autoimmunity. Activation of T helper 17 (Th17) cells by members of the gut
microbiota can contribute to autoimmunity. Further, evidence is emerging that the diet influences both the
immune system and the microbiome. While the pairwise interactions between dietary factors, the microbiota,
and immunity have been broadly characterized, the field is just beginning to investigate the mechanistic interplay
between diet, microbiome, and immunity and the downstream consequences on autoimmunity. The goals of this
work are to investigate microbial mechanisms of Th17 cell activation, their diet-responsiveness, and the
functional consequences of these interactions on autoimmune diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease
(IBD) and multiple sclerosis (MS). Our preliminary studies reveal mechanistic insights into specific diet-
dependent factors that counteract specific pro-inflammatory gut bacterial species. Two prevalent human gut
species associated with human autoimmune diseases, Eggerthella lenta and Bifidobacterium adolescentis,
induce Th17 cells in the intestine in a diet-dependent manner. Dietary arginine and ketogenic diets (KDs) prevent
Th17 induction by E. lenta and B. adolescentis respectively. Further, a specific bacterial gene in E. lenta, cgr2,
is sufficient to activate Th17 cells. We aim to determine diet-dependent mechanisms of Th17 activation by E.
lenta metabolites and functional consequences IBD and MS mouse models. By combining immunological and
microbiome techniques with metabolomics and translational research expertise of our collaborators we aim to
identify a small molecule metabolized by E. lenta responsible for Th17 activation and assess the disease
relevance of dietary modulation of this metabolism. Secondly, we aim to examine the mechanism and disease
relevance of ketone bodies for limiting gut bacterial Th17 induction. A KD-associated gut microbiota reduces
intestinal Th17 cells via selective inhibition of bifidobacterial growth by the ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate (βHB).
Therefore, we hypothesize that the ketone body βHB selectively inhibits B. adolescentis-mediated Th17 induction
resulting in functional consequences for MS disease models. To address this hypothesis and elucidate the
mechanism by which βHB impacts the Th17 induction capacity of B. adolescentis, we will use bacterial genetic
manipulation and disease models. The proposed aims will leverage the candidate’s expertise in immunology and
microbiome studies with new training in metabolomics, bacterial genetics, and translational research studies.
UCSF’s institutional focus on the microbiome, metabolomics, immunology and translational research and close
collaboration with experts in these areas will provide an ideal environment for the proposed scientific and
professional development leading to the creation of an independent research program."
11042906,"Project Summary
Pain is complex and consists of three dimensions: sensory-discriminative, affective-motivational, and cognitive-
evaluative, yet the EEG profile of the cortical activity that underlies the cognitive processing of the pain
dimensions is not known. Pain questionnaires such as the widely utilized McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ)
contain sections that assess the sensory and affective dimensions of pain, and it is well known that these pain
dimensions are associated with activity in select cortical areas. However, the pain literature lacks a
comprehensive and methodologically robust profile of the EEG cortical activity that underlies cognitive
processing of the multidimensional pain experience, particularly in osteoarthritis. Further, recent systematic
reviews suggested that there is a need for significant advancement in methodological robustness in EEG pain
studies. The primary objective of this basic/ disease-related research, is to provide a methodologically robust,
cortex-wide, full-frequency band profile of cortical EEG activity associated with the cognitive processing of the
sensory-discriminative and affective-motivational dimensions of osteoarthritis knee pain. We will record cortical
activity using EEG in participants without and with chronic knee pain (osteoarthritis) at both baseline resting-
state and during experimentally-induced pain (cold pressor task) with simultaneous presentation of previously
validated sensory dimension and affective dimension questions from the MPQ. Aim 1 is to elucidate the
cortical EEG response that underlies the cognitive processing of the sensory-discriminative dimensions of pain
by presenting sensory stimuli during an acute pain stimulus in participants both with and without chronic
osteoarthritis knee pain. Aim 2 is to investigate the cortical EEG response that underlies the cognitive
processing of the affective-motivational dimension of pain by presenting affective stimuli during an acute pain
stimulus in participants both with and without chronic osteoarthritis knee pain. Aim 3 is to use a new approach
to overcome barriers to progress in the field that occur due to narrow reporting of EEG outcomes and lack of
rigor. We used recent systematic reviews to identify key barriers to advancement in the field due to rigor. At the
conclusion of this work we will provide a comprehensive EEG profile including full-frequency band activities
from all electrodes, with coherence, absolute, and overall power, to be conducted in a robust sample of
participants with sex-matched controls, a large number of experimental trials, and statistical adjustments for
multiple comparisons. Due to the robust methodological and statistical design that sets this study apart,
findings will be meaningful even if the hypotheses are not supported. These data will provide novel insights into
the cortical EEG profile of the cognitive processing of the multidimensional pain experience in knee
osteoarthritis. Imaging of cortical activity during pain can reveal mechanisms of pain processing which is
indispensable for knowledge of pain physiology as well as development of novel treatment targets."
11046071,"Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death from infection globally. Our knowledge of the cellular and
molecular events that link inhalation of the causative bacterium, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), with either
clearance or productive infection remains limited. The type I interferon (IFN) response is among the first innate
immune responses triggered in Mtb-infected macrophages. Growing evidence suggests that type I IFNs, and
specifically cross-talk between the type I IFN response and the IL-1 axis, drive pathogenesis in TB. However,
our understanding of the cascade of events that initiate the type I IFN response in Mtb-infected host cells is
incomplete. The literature increasingly supports a model in which mitochondrial damage is a key driver of type I
IFN production in Mtb-infected macrophages. In preliminary work, we have uncovered a set of previously
unappreciated additional cellular pathways that contribute to Mtb-induced type I IFNs, including the ER stress
response (ESR), lipid droplet (LD) formation, and eicosanoid production. In the proposed work, we will build
upon our preliminary results to define molecular relationships between ER stress, LD formation, eicosanoid
production, and mitochondrial damage in type I IFN response to Mtb. We will then use a murine model of
infection to test the impact of modulating the ESR on infection outcomes. In Aim 1, we will use CRISPR
technology to build genetic tools to study the pathways of interest. Using these tools and small molecule
inhibitors, we will then test links between arms of the ESR, LD formation, eicosanoid production, and type I
IFNs. To more completely characterize the role of the ESR and individual response pathways in the
macrophage response to Mtb, we will additionally perform multiplexed cytokine analysis, transcriptional
profiling, and metabolomics using our genetic and small molecule tools that perturb the ESR. In Aim 2, we will
test which of the identified contributors to type I IFNs drive mitochondrial damage. In Aim 3, we will use small
molecule inhibitors in two murine models of TB infection to determine how modulating the ESR in the context
of TB infection changes bacterial burden, immune cell recruitment to the lung compartment, histopathology,
cytokine responses, and the transcriptional response. Upon achieving our aims, we anticipate having
developed a new, more complex model for induction of type I IFNs in Mtb-infected macrophages. Further, we
anticipate having determined how the ESR shapes the macrophage response to Mtb infection and contributes
to infection outcomes in vivo. We anticipate these results will ultimately inform the development of novel host
directed therapies for TB."

11043597,"Project Summary
In 2022 approximately 61.2 million people aged 12 and older reported binge alcohol use in the past month and
young adults ages 18 to 25 represent the highest proportion of binge drinkers. Binge drinking puts the user at
risk for a multitude of acute (e.g., blackouts, risky sex, motor vehicle accidents, etc.) and chronic (e.g., alcohol
use disorder, liver disease) negative health outcomes. Despite the variety of interventions that have been
developed, very few have shown high levels of effectiveness. There remains a need to improve strategies to
slow the progression from risky drinking to alcohol use disorder. Cue exposure therapy has been proposed as a
potential treatment and intervention for problematic alcohol use, yet recent meta-analytic work has suggested
limited effectiveness for cue exposure interventions. A challenge in this area is that most research has failed to
capture the multisensory nature of cues. Recent work has demonstrated that multisensory aspects of craving
and cue reactivity are associated with addictive behaviors. These findings emphasize the importance of
addressing the multisensory nature of cue reactivity as an intervention component. Moreover, the response to
multisensory alcohol cues may also depend on the level of realistic appearance. Virtual reality technology has
been used to explore cue reactivity in relation to addictive behavior, but few studies have adequately examined
the multisensory aspects in conjunction with degree of realism specifically for alcohol cues. The proposed study
will examine behavioral and electrophysiological cue reactivity by comparing responses to uni- and multisensory
alcohol and neutral cues varying in degree of realistic appearance. We will also explore the effects of
multisensory congruence as a factor to modulate cue responses. Young adults will be recruited into two groups
(binge or social drinkers) based on their alcohol consumption. Participants will complete a passive viewing task
involving presentation of visual unisensory and multisensory (visuo-olfactory, and visuo-olfactory-tactile) neutral
and individualized alcohol cues that vary in degree of realism (two–dimensional images vs. three dimensional
simulations in virtual reality vs. real physical objects). Participants will also perform a cross-modal Stroop-like
task in which they respond to alcohol and neutral cues that differ in terms of multisensory congruence. Self-
reported craving, alcohol consumption, and related behaviors will also be assessed. The proposed study
provides an ideal framework for undergraduate students to acquire research experience on a scientific project
that is directly relevant for young adults and has potential for broader public health significance."
11043087,"The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) refers to a connected infrastructure of medical devices, healthcare
software, and digital health services. This infrastructure transports health data to the cloud or internal servers
through healthcare provider networks. The recent increase in IoMT has rapidly changed the healthcare industry.
Its use in hospitals, however, has also raised severe security and privacy concerns. In October 2018, the FDA
highlighted the vulnerability of numerous implantable cardioverter defibrillators to malicious attacks. This
emphasizes that real-world attacks on IoMT can cause life-threatening risks to patients. Existing security
solutions, primarily prevention-based, are insufficient due to constraints on power consumption, costly resources,
and patient safety. Integrating machine learning algorithms for predicting and identifying potential cyber threats
represents a promising advancement. They, however, were not widely accepted in medical practice because of
their inherent complexity and lack of explainability. These constraints make implementing robust security
systems challenging. Our research proposes a novel explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) based hybrid
intrusion detection system to enhance the security of IoMT devices. It aims to develop an integrated security
framework for detecting malicious attacks by providing understandable explanations of their decisions to
healthcare administrators. In particular, the proposed research has three specific aims. First, we will create a
formal threat analysis model to examine known vulnerabilities by executing attacks on targeted devices. This is
known as misuse detection. Then, advanced machine learning algorithms will be developed to model normal
behavior and detect anomalies representing unknown malicious activities. This is known as anomaly detection.
Subsequently, we will construct an explainable hybrid detection model to combine both misuse and anomaly
detectors effectively and efficiently. To our knowledge, the proposed research is pioneering in integrating formal
threat analysis model based misuse and machine learning-based anomaly detection in an XAI framework. The
study is significant because it comprehensively addresses known and unknown threats against medical devices.
Its outcomes will improve healthcare delivery, reduce treatment errors, and improve patient trust."

Protein ubiquitination is a posttranslational modification that is essential for nervous system function. UB requires
the utilization of a series of enzymes called E1, E2, and E3 that enable the covalent addition of ubiquitin (UB) to
to its cellular targets. Protein ubiquitination is also a highly reversible process which is handled by enzymes
called deubiquitinases (DUBs) that cut and/or edit UB chains on substrates. While numerous neurological
disorders are associated with mutations in the UB enzyme machinery, the role of protein ubiquitination under
non-diseased states and the intricate mechanisms by which proteins become ubiquitinated and deubiquitinated
in the nervous system remain vastly uncharacterized. Using an unbiased proteomics screen for substrates of
the E3 UB ligase RNF216, we identified the DUB OTUD4 and proteins within the OTUD4 interaction network as
substrates. Remarkably, mutations in OTUD4 and RNF216 have been identified in Gordon Holmes syndrome
(GHS), where patients have neuroendocrine dysfunction, neurodegeneration, and dementia. Increases in
OTUD4 mRNA and protein were also identified in individuals with frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Our
preliminary data show that RNF216 regulates OTUD4 ubiquitination, which is reduced in the OTUD4 GHS-
associated mutation. Moreover, OTUD4 was found to de-ubiquitinate RNF216, which was increased in the GHS-
associated mutation. In the proposed work, we will test the hypothesis that excessive OTUD4 DUB activity is a
driving factor in neurodegenerative disease. In Aim 1, we will determine if RNF216 ubiquitination of OTUD4 is
destabilizing and if the OTUD4 GHS mutation has enhanced stability. In Aim 2, we will determine if the interaction
between OTUD4 and RNF216 would enable OTUD4 to function as a direct DUB of RNF216 and affect its stability
and catalytic activity for conjugating UB to substrate proteins. In Aim 3, we will determine if OTUD4 gain-of-
function increases neuroinflammation and leads to reproductive impairments, and if reductions in its activity can
restore these deficiencies in GHS models. Completion of these aims will increase our understanding on how E3s
and DUBs are coordinated in the nervous system. Our work will also outline a mechanism to explain how
mutations and increased activity of OTUD4 drive GHS pathologies, and will identify new therapeutic targets for
the treatment of GHS and other related disorders."

Hispanic/Latinx people are disproportionately affected by HIV: In 2021, according to the
Centers for Disease Control, Hispanic/Latinx persons made up 18% of the population of the United
States but accounted for 29% of new HIV diagnoses. Hispanic/Latinx men who have sex with men
(MSM) accounted for 33% of diagnoses among all MSM. In Puerto Rico (PR), there are currently
15,801 people living with HIV. San Juan, the capital of PR, is a Phase 1 Priority Jurisdiction identified in the
Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) Initiative. Latinx people in PR have an estimated lifetime risk for HIV
infection of 2.08% (1 in 48), higher than the lifetime risk for HIV diagnosis among Latinx people in the
continental United States (1.92%;1 in 52). Furthermore, the estimated HIV prevalence in the general adult
population in PR is nearly 1.1%, and 7.3% among sexual minority men. PR also has one of the highest
levels of HIV status unawareness among sexual minority men, and the lowest pre-exposure prophylaxis
uptake reported in the United States. Greater diversity in the healthcare workforce is an important strategy to
address racial and ethnic healthcare disparities. The Rustbelt CFAR proposed to develop education and training
pathways for Puerto Rican students to become scientists or physician-scientists engaged in HIV/AIDS research.
The Rustbelt Investigators for the Next Generation (RING) Program was first developed and funded in
2022/23 in response to the NIH supplement request for CFAR Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Pathway Initiatives
(CDEIPI). The objectives of the RING Program are (a) to provide a 10-week summer mentored research-training
experience in HIV/AIDS for 10 undergraduate and/or masters students from the University of PR (UPR) at Case
Western Reserve University (CWRU) or the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt); (b) to provide career development
activities, including weekly seminars led by outstanding faculty leaders and training in techniques in the Rustbelt
CFAR laboratories and core facilities that lead to research careers in HIV; and (c) to evaluate the scholars’
attitudes about engaging in a research career in HIV before and after participation in the RING Program. The
goal of the new Rustbelt CFAR-PREP is to enhance the pool of PR students who complete PhD degrees in
HIV/AIDS. Considerations driving the development of the Rustbelt CFAR PREP included: (a) while research
opportunities exist in the UPR system, they often lack the depth, breadth and rigor of those on the mainland,
leaving students under-prepared for graduate school; and (b) many UPR students already take “gap” years to
prepare for graduate school, but are pressured into and distracted by part-time employment for financial reasons.
We will recruit students from UPR campuses in Rίo Piedras (a populous district of San Juan), Mayagüez, Cayey,
Humacao, and the Medical Sciences campus in San Juan for the RING and CFAR-PREP programs. The third
program in this continuous pipeline of student researchers in HIV is to develop and implement the Rustbelt
CFAR/UPR PhD Training Program for graduate students engaged in HIV research at the UPR Medical
Sciences Campus. The Rustbelt CFAR is committed to developing scientists in PR that have the expertise to
address the local HIV epidemic."

Understanding how T cell receptors (TCRs) see tumor antigens presented by MHCs is necessary to fully
understand how the immune system recognizes tumor antigens, and to reap the full potential of antigen-specific
immunotherapy. To achieve this goal, a quantum leap forward is required in which the revolutionary advances
in machine learning are combined with a large volume of structure, function, data on matched TCR-pMHC pairs.
The development of accurate predictors of TCR-antigen recognition will be dependent on the creation and
integration sequencing-based datasets with high-throughput structural and functional insights. Our proposal,
submitted as a CRUK/NCI Grand Challenge team (MATCHMAKERS) will combine researchers with expertise in
immunology, methods development, structural biology, and computation to enable generalized prediction and
design of TCR recognition. This work will be spread across four Work Packages (WPs):
WP1: Large-scale generation of TCR-pMHC pairs from naturally occurring sources. We will build datasets of
naturally occurring TCR-pMHC pairs. Our team will use an array of approaches to collect these datasets, from
humans and from mouse models, and in the context of both cancer and immunity more generally.
WP2: Ultra-high throughput TCR-pMHC matching using molecular engineering. Efforts to create general models
will require a broader array of data than feasible to collect from natural TCR systems. We will use an array of
synthetic approaches developed by our team to comprehensively match TCRs with pMHCs to train
computational models.
WP3: Large-scale structural and biochemical analyses of TCR-pMHC interactions. A key to our team's vision is
to match interaction datasets with high throughput structural and functional insights. A deep understanding of
how the TCR contacts with MHC helices control function and orientation will be essential for training and testing
computational models.
WP4 AI-based prediction and design of TCR-pMHC interactions. We will integrate our data to train next-
generation algorithms capable of generally predicting and designing TCR-pMHC interactions. These predictions
will proceed through a reiterative testing and feedback circuits for further model optimization."

The 8q24 genomic locus, containing the gene Tribbles pseudokinase 1 (TRIB1) has been repeatedly linked via
human genome-wide association study with multiple cardiometabolic parameters. This includes plasma total
cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, coronary artery disease (CAD), circulating liver
enzymes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), circulating adiponectin, and HbA1c. Despite the genetic
evidence supporting a role for this gene in human disease and early observations underscoring the importance
of hepatic Trib1, mechanistic studies of this gene have lagged. In the parent application, we presented
preliminary data demonstrating that hepatic TRIB1 promotes COP1-dependent ubiquitination of the transcription
factor C/EBPα, and this process requires a novel interaction with a different pseudokinase, STK40. Additionally,
we established multiple in vivo animal models to test the therapeutic potential of increased hepatic Trib1 activity
in animal models of metabolic disease. Finally, we utilized whole exome sequencing in a highly novel
consanguineous population to identify predicted loss-of-function (pLoF) variants in TRIB1 that can help
determine its function in humans. This parent award experimental plan aims to address the following specific
aims: 1) To determine how hepatic TRIB1-mediated ubiquitination of target proteins is regulated by STK40; 2)
To determine the therapeutic benefit of Trib1 overexpression in animal models of CAD and NAFLD, and the
requirement for C/EBPα for such benefits; and 3) To determine the direction of effect and therapeutic potential
for TRIB1 through the identification and metabolic phenotyping of subjects harboring TRIB1 pLoF variants. This
diversity supplement expands the scope of aim 3 from the parent award by investigating pLoF variants identified
in CEBPA. As this is the major downstream target of TRIB1, the identification of pLoF C/EBPα proteins can help
elucidate the function of the TRIB1-C/EBPα hepatic regulatory axis in human physiology and disease. During
this diversity supplement, the candidate will test the functional effects of pLoF CEBPA variants via the following
in vitro and in vivo techniques: 1) generate recombinant mutant CEBPA cDNA constructs containing rare pLoF
mutations and test their ability to activate a custom C/EBPα-responsive luciferase reporter, and 2) generate AAV
plasmid constructs of mutant CEBPA to test the ability of these to induce steatosis in wild-type mice and rescue
the phenotype of mice with hepatic Cebpa deletion. The completion of these studies will add to our understanding
of the role of the TRIB1-C/EBPα regulatory axis in human hepatic metabolism and help elucidate the therapeutic
potential of TRIB1. These studies will also further our understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of the
myriad genetic associations with the TRIB1 gene in humans. Our ultimate goal is an in depth understanding of
the functions of hepatic TRIB1 with the hope that this can inform therapeutic strategies targeting dyslipidemia
and resultant CAD, steatosis and NAFLD, and metabolic syndrome in humans."

Older persons with HIV (PWH) experience high rates of non-infectious, aging-related
comorbidities including frailty, diabetes (DM), and cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared to the
general population. Geroscience approaches focus on therapeutically targeting fundamental
aging processes to delay onset of or alleviate aging-related comorbidities. Cellular senescence is
a fundamental aging process for which targeted compounds have recently been identified. This
process is characterized by stable growth arrest and chronic inflammation, measurable markers
of which are known as the Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP). Senescent cell
burden and SASP-related factors have been associated with frailty, diabetes, and cardiovascular
disease in persons without HIV. Compared to tissue markers of cellular senescence, soluble
SASP biomarkers are easier to obtain, allowing their application more diverse clinical settings
However, associations between soluble SASP biomarkers and frailty, DM, and CVD have not
been well-characterized among PWH. The proposed study will examine the longitudinal
associations between levels of soluble SASP biomarkers and frailty, CM, and CVD in older PWH
in the AIDS Clinical Trial Group (ACTG) A5322/ HIV Infection, Aging, and Immune Function Long-
term Observational Study (HAILO). This study will extend the work of our currently funded cross-
sectional analysis of SASP biomarkers and frailty, DM, and CVD among HAILO participants and
be the first to characterize the longitudinal associations between SASP biomarkers and these
conditions of interest among PWH. The findings from this study will provide pilot data for potential
biomarkers to be targeted in future interventional trials using senotherapeutic agents to prevent
or alleviate frailty, DM, or CVD among older PWH."

 Access to healthcare is a persistent public policy concern, particularly for Marshallese Compact of Free
Association (COFA) migrants in the United States. This research addresses the impact of Medicaid policy
changes, prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic, on healthcare access for Marshallese COFA migrants
residing in Northwest Arkansas, where the largest settlement of this population (~15,000) exists. Despite their
eligibility for Medicaid under the 1986 RMI-US COFA agreement, subsequent legislative changes, notably the
1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA), resulted in a significant
portion (approximately 50%) of the Marshallese population being devoid of healthcare coverage.
 Even after the enactment of the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid expansion in 2014, which did not
reinstate Medicaid coverage for COFA migrants, these disparities persisted. The Consolidated Appropriations
Act of December 2020 reinstated Medicaid access after a 25-year gap. However, the effectiveness of this
policy change in ensuring enrollment and optimizing healthcare service utilization remains unknown.
 The overall objective of this study is to determine the effect of Medicaid policy changes enacted in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic for Marshallese COFA migrants. We will leverage our long-standing
community-engaged relationship with the Marshallese community in Arkansas to collect primary data to
generate important data on the barriers and facilitators to Medicaid enrollment for Marshallese COFA migrants,
and to inform effective community-based interventions. Our Specific Aims are: Aim 1: Examine the Medicaid
enrollment process and identify barriers and facilitators to healthcare for Marshallese newly eligible
under Medicaid policy changes. We will conduct four focus groups with 50 Marshallese to qualitatively
explore barriers and facilitators to Medicaid enrollment and accessing healthcare services. Aim 2: Conduct a
needs assessment to assess barriers and facilitators to inform community-based interventions to
improve Medicaid enrollment and use of primary and preventative healthcare services. We will develop
and administer a survey to 750 Marshallese to assess the need for community-based interventions to increase
enrollment and the use of healthcare services. The survey will focus on barriers and facilitators to Medicaid
enrollment and primary/preventative healthcare utilization, and use the themes that emerge in Aim 1 to direct
the selection of additional existing validated survey measures. The study's findings will contribute essential
information for the development of community-based interventions tailored to enhance Medicaid enrollment
and healthcare service utilization among COFA migrants and other underserved populations. The established
rapport with the Marshallese community uniquely positions us to implement and evaluate these interventions,
fostering equitable healthcare delivery."
11043719,"SUMMARY
Proper development of gametes is crucial for the continuation of sexually reproducing species. To succeed,
germline stem cells that populate the gonads must complete a long developmental process that yields highly
differentiated cells: the sperm and egg. These can come together to form a totipotent zygote capable of
developing into an individual. Thus far, genetic screens in mice, flies, and nematodes, have identified
numerous genes required development of the germline. However, voids remain to be filled in our
understanding of the genetic mechanisms that secure the production of functional gametes. To fill some of
these voids, the proposed line of research will explore a new avenue for discovery of genes involved in
germline development. The planarian flatworm Schmidtea mediterranea is an increasingly popular organism
for stem cell research, which holds great promise as a model for reproductive biology. Planarians have an
unmatched ability to completely regenerate their entire reproductive system, including germline stem cells,
throughout their lifetime. This allows experimental analysis of the entire process of gametogenesis without
being confined to a specific developmental window or limited by potential secondary effects on embryogenesis.
Also relevant is the fact that planarians specify their germline through inductive signals that originate from the
soma, which is also true of mammals but not of fly or nematode research models. Experiments performed as
part of this proposal are expected to reveal conserved pathways that control germ cell development by: 1)
Elucidating the mechanisms that lead to use of alternative cleavage and polyadenylation sites during pre-
mRNA 3’end processing in germ cells compared to soma; 2) Uncovering the connection between nuclear
3’end processing and cytoplasmic polyadenylation in germ cells; and 3) Identifying subtle differences in gene
expression and function between germline stem cells in male and female gonads. Due to availability of
optimized protocols for assessing distribution of gene expression in planarians, ease of maintenance and
induction of systemic specific gene knockdown, as well as availability of molecular markers for virtually every
stage in germline development (and somatic tissues), the expression and function of dozens of genes can be
determined during the award period by research performed in large by undergraduate students. Completion of
this project is important because it will reveal conserved processes involved in development of functional
gametes. Additionally, this work will expose dozens of undergraduate students to meritorious research and
strengthen the research environment at the University of Massachusetts Boston, which are specific goals of
the AREA program."
11046141,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A major challenge in organ transplantation is the shortage of human organs. The Sykes lab has focused on
investigating and developing new methods for inducing tolerance to prevent graft rejection. A method to address
organ shortages is through the development and increased use of xenotransplantation, such as pig to human
organ transplants. A major barrier of xenotransplantation is the necessity for long-term, high levels of
immunosuppression due to increased polymorphisms compared to human to human organ transplantation.
Although we have demonstrated the ability to achieve human T cell development in pig thymus grafts, we have
also identified defects in positive and negative selection on a pig thymic epithelium of human T cells that must
interact with human APCs in the periphery following transplantation. Our lab has been able to construct a hybrid
porcine thymus that showed improved immunological functions. Thus, the objective of Project 3 in the parent
proposal is to investigate the possibility of tolerance induction in humans through the use of mixed xenogeneic
chimerism and two types of porcine thymic transplantation in HIS mice. Specific AIM #1 of Project 3 of the parent
grant is to achieve optimal tolerance and immune function by combining mixed chimerism with either hybrid
thymic transplantation or pig plus human thymic transplantation. Specific Aim #2 is to determine the mechanisms
of T and B cell tolerance of this mixed chimerism and thymic transplantation in HIS mice. The proposed studies
for this supplement relate to the investigation proposed for Specific Aim #2 of the parent grant, in which we will
determine the mechanisms of T cell tolerance through mixed chimerism and thymic transplantation. This
supplemental proposal aims to develop a method of clarifying the role of Treg mechanisms in xenotolerance.
The supplement focuses on generating and understanding the human anti-pig Treg repertoire and the role of
direct and indirect Treg responses in tolerance modeled by our two approaches in the parent grant. The proposed
studies will establish a clear method for investigating the role of Tregs with direct and indirect specificity in
induced human T cell tolerance to porcine xenografts These studies will also be of considerable relevance to
studies in Project 2, in which expanded baboon Tregs are used to promote mixed chimerism from porcine donors."

This goal of this proposal is to revise the District of Columbia Center for AIDS Research (DC CFAR)
Administrative Core to include the CFAR Pathway Programs Coordinating Center (CPPCC). The CPPCC will
include three Cores:
The Administrative Core will be led by the DC CFAR Director Dr. Alan Greenberg and Administrative Director
Ms. Brandi Robinson. The CPPCC will be responsible for fiscal oversight of CPPCC resources, maintenance of
the CPPCC website, developing and disseminating the quarterly CPPCC e-newsletter, and coordinating cross-
CFAR scientific publication efforts. The Administrative Core will schedule quarterly meetings with the CFAR
pathway program leads and with the NIH CFAR Program Office.
The Program Core will be led by Dr. Anthony Wutoh, Howard University Provost and DC CFAR Developmental
Core Co-Director, and Dr. Lisa Bowleg, DC CFAR Social and Behavioral Science Core Co-Director. The
Program Core will convene quarterly meetings of the CFAR pathway program leads which will be the principal
forum for exchanging programmatic ideas, identifying best practices and common challenges, and providing
high-level feedback to the NIH. The Program Core will also develop cross-CFAR activities such as facilitating
access to didactic sessions across CFAR sites, cross-CFAR exchange of information about mentored research
experiences, and national meetings of CDEIPI scholars and mentors.
The Evaluation Core will be led by the DC CFAR Co-Director Dr. Manya Magnus and Senior Research
Program Manager Ms. Lorena Segarra. The Evaluation Core will convene quarterly meetings of the CFAR
pathway program evaluation leads to coordinate the monitoring and evaluation components of CFAR pathway
programs; chronicle the development of the program approaches; develop, harmonize, and assess short- and
long-term process and outcome measures; and conduct qualitative and quantitative research about the overall
delivery and impacts of the program. The three primary activities will be building and implementing a
consensus-based evaluation strategy with CFAR pathway programs; collecting, managing and analyzing
individual- and aggregate-level characteristics to inform our understanding of the challenges and successes
encountered by newly and previously funded CFAR pathway programs; and leading innovative approaches to
describe the impact of the CFAR pathway programs."
11046163,"PROJECT SUMMARY (Revised July 15, 2021) – NO CHANGES FROM PARENT GRANT
Aqueous-deficient dry eye is among the most common and debilitating clinical manifestations of systemic
autoimmune diseases such as Sjögren's, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. While it is well established that
chronic inflammation of the ocular surface and exocrine glands (e.g., lacrimal gland) represents the
predominant driving force in dry eye disease, pathological alterations in the cornea are among the most
common and debilitating clinical manifestations of autoimmune-mediated dry eye. With the cornea providing
approximately two-thirds of the eye's focusing power and protecting the anterior eye from environmental,
inflammatory and microbial insult, disease-mediated corruption of tissue function and homeostasis has a vast
array of pathological outcomes. Indeed, a multitude of studies in both human patients and mouse models of
aqueous-deficient dry eye illustrate late-stage disease encompasses epithelial barrier disruption, epithelial
hyperplasia, reduced corneal innervation and inflammatory cell infiltration. Thus, dry eye disease induces
pathological changes along multiple levels. However, due to the limited understanding of the cellular makeup
of the cornea, including the lineage relationships of specific cell types, the impact of dry eye on cell
heterogeneity and lineage outcomes is unknown. To help solve this significant problem, we have begun to
define the cellular diversity and differentiation trajectories of corneal cells and how these are perturbed by dry
eye disease using single cell nuclei RNAsequencing in combination with the autoimmune regulatory (Aire)-
deficient mouse model. Using this model, we have also begun to identify novel changes in corneal cell
composition at late disease stages that may underlie disease progression. Based on these data we
hypothesize that disease progression is promoted by an alteration in corneal cell fate that compromises the
repair and cellular replenishment of the tissue. We propose to explore this hypothesis by first defining epithelial
and stromal cell heterogeneity, differentiation trajectories and stem cells in the homeostatic cornea. We will
then seek to elucidate the impact of dry eye on the identity of the corneal cell lineages at late stage disease.
Outcomes from these studies will aid in the development of therapeutics to halt disease progression, as well as
the generation of diagnostic targets for early intervention."

This is an initial submission of a K23 application by Dr. Marciana Laster from the University of California, Los
Angeles (UCLA). Candidate: Dr. Laster’s training objectives in this proposal include to: 1) develop expertise in
the physiology and genetics of the PTH-Vitamin D axis, 2) gain further skills in the management of
epidemiologic data, principles of genetic association studies and advanced bio-statistical approaches and 3)
develop expertise in the assessment of bone turnover by bone histomorphometry. Dr. Laster will accomplish
these activities through mentorship, coursework and participation in workshops. She has assembled a team of
scientists including her primary mentor Dr. Isidro Salusky, an expert in pediatric CKD-MBD and co-mentor Dr.
Ravi Thadhani, an expert in Vitamin D metabolism. Research: Pediatric CKD-MBD affects nearly all pediatric
patients with CKD by the time they reach dialysis. Despite years of treatment with active Vitamin D sterols,
skeletal morbidity and cardiovascular mortality remain unacceptably high. Dr. Laster’s long-term goal is to
individualize the treatment of pediatric CKD-MBD in order to improve the health and quality of life of pediatric
CKD patients. The first step toward accomplishing this goal involves the identification of genetic variants that
predict PTH levels and skeletal response to PTH levels. Dr. Laster hypothesizes that the risk of secondary
hyperparathyroidism and the degree of PTH responsiveness in CKD are predicted by genetic variation in the
Vitamin D Receptor (VDR) gene, which mediates PTH release and osteoclast activity, and the Vitamin D
Binding Protein (VDBP) gene, which mediates vitamin D transport and osteoclast activity. In Dr. Laster’s
preliminary work she demonstrated clinical outcomes suggestive of underlying PTH resistance amongst
African-Americans. A genetic basis of this PTH resistance is supported by studies demonstrating select genetic
variants found frequently amongst African-Americans which are associated with a clinical picture suggestive of
PTH resistance. In Aim 1, Dr. Laster will identify SNPs within the VDR and VDBP genes that explain variation
in PTH levels using a pre-dialysis CKD cohort of 1076 patients and a dialysis cohort of 100 patients. This aim
will establish how SNPs in the VDR and VDBP associate with serum PTH levels in the pediatric CKD
population. In Aim 2, Dr. Laster will identify SNPs in the VDR and VDBP that explain variation in PTH-adjusted
bone turnover. This aim will establish SNPs that are associated with a variable response of bone to elevations
in PTH (i.e. PTH resistance). In Aim 3, Dr. Laster will perform a genome wide association study in the 1076
pediatric pre-dialysis CKD patients in order to identify novel SNPs that explain variation in PTH levels. Dr.
Laster’s aims will help to establish a phenotype of skeletal response that can then be used to individualize the
intensity of pediatric CKD-MBD therapy."
11047207,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The Arkansas Integrative Metabolic Research Center (AIMRC) is a Phase I COBRE at the University of Arkansas
at Fayetteville (04/01/2021-02/28/2026; PI: Dr. Kyle P. Quinn). The scientific theme of the AIMRC is to understand
the role of cell and tissue metabolism in disease through biomedical research involving advanced imaging,
bioenergetics, and data science. The long-term objective of the AIMRC is to establish a sustainable
interdisciplinary research center that can support biomedical research at the U of A, grow the emerging strength
in metabolic research on campus, and collaborate with other COBRE centers, such as the MaineHealth Institute
for Research. The overall goal of this administrative supplement is to characterize the impact of a chimeric
superFGF1-FGF21 protein on dysregulated metabolism diseases as it is now well accepted that there are
numerous factors contributing to a patient being considered at high risk for cancer development, with
dysregulated metabolism being the most prominent. Modulating an individual's metabolic condition presents a
potential treatment option to mitigate the risk of cancer development. The proposed study introduces a chimeric
Fibroblast Growth Factor hyperstable non-heparin binding FGF 1 (superFGF1) and the C-terminal terminal tail
of FGF21, named superFGF1-FGF21 C-terminal tail, harnessing the metabolic modulation properties of both
FGF21 and the FGF receptor binding capabilities of FGF1 and FGF21. The metabolic cytokine, FGF21, a non-
heparin binding cytokine, modulates lipid and glucose oxidation activates mTOR signaling, and requires
alpha/beta Klotho co-receptors for FGF receptor binding. FGF1, on the other hand, is known for its ability to
modulate metabolism and interact with all known isoforms of FGFR, which complements FGF21. The
hypothesis is that combining the metabolic stimulatory activity of FGF21 with the FGFR binding capacity
of FGF1 in a hyper-stable superFGF1-FGF21 chimera can yield a potent regulator of metabolic condition.
The development of this recombinant chimera, confirmed through successful overexpression and purification
with superior stability in preliminary data, is positioned to diffuse through the heparin-rich extracellular matrix,
reaching distant organs in a hormone-like manner. The proposed study outlines two main objectives: 1) Refine
the superFGF1-FGF21 chimeric protein and characterize its therapeutic capabilities to regulate adipogenic
differentiation and lypolysis; 2) Assess the therapeutic potential of the FGF1-FGF21 chimera in a model of
Diamond Blackfan Anemia (DBA), a ribosomopathy characterized by dysregulated protein metabolism and
predisposition to cancer growth. A multidisciplinary team with expertise in structural biology, FGF biology,
adipose metabolism, protein synthesis, and two-photon microscopy has been assembled. We expect that the
results of this pilot study will lay the foundation for future multi-PI R01 submissions and active collaborative
research between the two teams to successfully decipher the correlation between metabolic dysfunction and
cancer."
11045203,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Tobacco use remains a leading cause of premature disease and death in the United States, including those
attributable to cancer. In a landmark racketeering lawsuit filed by the US Department of Justice in 1999,
several major tobacco manufacturers were found guilty of consumer fraud, which included deceptive tactics
such as lying to consumers about the deadly effects of cigarettes, manipulating cigarettes to make them more
addictive, and marketing their products to young people. To help remedy these actions, the court ordered the
manufacturers to run a series of “corrective statements” in several communication channels in the US,
including television, newspapers, and signage displays in stores at the point-of-sale. After nearly two decades
of tobacco industry litigation to delay the corrective statement requirement in retail settings – one of the
industry’s most valuable marketing channels – a 2022 court order finally mandated that the signs be posted
from October 1, 2023 through June 30, 2025, a 21-month period. More than 200,000 retailers that have
marketing agreements with the affected manufacturers – approximately 2 in 3 retailers nationwide – are
required to display these large, eye-catching signs that inform consumers about the health risks of tobacco and
the tobacco industry’s history of deception. While this historic retail-based intervention has the potential to
positively impact public health, critical questions remain about the nature of its implementation, reach, and
effects on consumers, including impacts on health equity. For example, it is unknown how implementation
features of the signage (e.g., presence, number, placement) may vary by store type and neighborhood; if, and
to what extent, consumers notice and retain the corrective messages; and whether exposure impacts tobacco
knowledge, beliefs, intentions and behaviors (e.g., quit attempts). The finite window of intervention delivery
offers a unique and time-sensitive opportunity to answer these questions, which may inform future large-scale
tobacco information dissemination efforts, as well as identify subpopulations who may benefit from
supplemental health education programs or other services. The specific aims of the study are to: (1)
Characterize both implementation and reach by collecting detailed information about corrective statement
implementation features through a retailer audit study. Supplemental analyses will calculate the
prevalence/density of retailers required to display the statements across the United States. (2) Use eye-
tracking methodologies to explore attention to the corrective statements (i.e., reach and impact) in the context
of real-world exposures. (3) Field longitudinal surveys of adults and youth to examine reach and impact of the
statements among a nationally representative sample, including reported exposures, message perceptions,
and impact on tobacco knowledge, attitudes, intentions and behaviors."

Cerebral malaria (CM), even with effective anti-malarial drugs, results in >450,000 deaths annually, with
pediatric case fatality rates ranging from 15-30%. This equates to >1300 dead children on any given day.
Long-term neurologic sequelae are identified in 30-50% of survivors. The neuropathogenesis of CM is
unclear and under-investigated, but an improved understanding is necessary to develop efficacious
therapies that improve outcomes. We have, in two different populations of African children with CM,
identified five distinct patterns of abnormal Transcranial Doppler Ultrasound (TCD) cerebral blood flow
velocities and waveforms, each with differing risks of neurologic morbidity or mortality. In a small cohort
of children with CM, we have also determined that multiple different types of disrupted flow-
metabolism coupling and cerebral metabolic dysfunction (luxury perfusion, misery perfusion, ischemia,
mitochondrial dysfunction) occurred in 85% of patients with CM. We hypothesize that in children with
CM, due to parasite and/or host factors, altered bioavailability of various vasoactive peptides results in
altered cerebrovascular tone/cerebral blood flow, flow metabolism uncoupling, and cerebral metabolic
dysfunction, with different combinations of abnormalities inherently associated with differing kinds and
risk of neurologic injury. This project will establish altered cerebral blood flow (CBF) and metabolism as
mechanistic contributors to neurologic injury in CM for the first time. Using non-targeted metabolomics,
we will also determine putative peptides contributing to the different categories of abnormal CBF and
metabolism. These peptides may then act as biomarkers of underlying mechanisms of injury or as
therapeutic targets. Using the large amounts of data that will be captured in the proposed work,
machine learning/cluster analysis will, also for the first time, determine endotypes of CM. This work is
innovative in that we will establish new mechanisms of neurologic injury in CM, identify associated
vasoactive peptides, and develop a novel framework that is a necessary step towards the delivery of
precision medicine in CM. Additionally, the work is innovative in that we will further develop and
validate a portable, non-invasive approach to measure CBF, cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen
consumption, and oxygen extraction fraction, an approach that may have widespread implications for
patient neuromonitoring during any acute neurocritical illness across all settings."
11045099,"SAMBAI: Societal, Ancestry, Molecular and Biological Analyses of Inequalities
Research Abstract
Background
Prostate, breast, and pancreatic cancers all have a disproportionately higher rate of aggressive tumor
grade and early onset in Black patients, with recent spikes of high incidence in West African nations
compared to other African regions. The genetic background correlations implicate predispositions.
Members of our SAMBAI team of investigators have pioneered genomics in cancer disparities research,
and over the past two decades, we have uncovered compelling evidence of distinct immunological
mechanisms associated with genetic ancestry. Our SAMBAI team members have developed methods to
quantify environmental exposures and interrogate the lived experiences of marginalized populations,
including epigenetic responses to racism.
Aims
We will partner with scientists across the US, Africa, and the UK to build an unprecedented resource, the
SAMBAI Biobank and Data Repository for Cancer Equity Research. We will generate a comprehensive,
accurate, and relevant measurement of social, environmental, genetic, and immunological factors to
complete an integrated set of analyses to define the causal vs. modifier relationships of disparate
outcomes in diverse underserved populations. We will establish a sustainable framework for team science
approaches with under-represented partners and establish best practices for coordinating cancer equity
research on a global scale.
Methods
We propose to utilize multiple methods across our different work packages. Social Determinants include
self-reporting surveys and database abstractions. Exposomes utilize mass spectrometry of plasma.
Genomics will utilize three sequencing methods on germline and tumor tissue, including long read,
short/deep, and ultra-low pass whole genome sequencing. Lastly, immunological profiles will be
measured with spatial transcriptomics and circulating multiplex immunoassays. These data require novel
computational frameworks, including cloud-based virtualization and the use of machine learning
technologies to identify novel associations across the strata of social to spatial data elements and across
our diverse geographic and ancestral SAMBAI cohorts.
Utility and Impact
We will improve research capacity in under-resourced environments for large-scale cancer research and
equitable access to data with equitable feasibility to improve treatment and outcomes. We will define
interactions of environmental exposures, social determinants, and genetic ancestry that determine
immunological landscapes of primary tumors and/or circulating immunological profiles in patients of
African descent. Our project will contribute a data repository with 100K features/patient, for 40,000
patients. The impact on this population includes a novel trial design, in collaboration with our patient
advocacy partners, to ensure that the specific genomic and immunological features we uncover become
part of targeted precision oncology theragnostic options."
11045111,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Synovial joints are essential for full range of motion and quality of life. Unfortunately, the joints -and articular
cartilage in particular- are highly susceptible to congenital-, injury- and age-related diseases that lead to
degeneration, a reflection of poor intrinsic cartilage repair capacity. Current clinical interventions do not meet
the wide range of demands on articular cartilage due, in large part, to lack of crucial knowledge on the cellular
mechanisms that govern normal functions of articular cartilage such as lubrication and tissue maintenance
growing adolescents and young adults. In order to advance these strategies, more information is needed on
basic mechanisms of articular cartilage development and adaptation/response to environmental changes in
vivo. The superficial most layer of articular cartilage is responsible for secreting proteoglycans (lubricants) into
the joint capsule that allow for frictionless movement. Many studies have focused on this as their primary
function, and increasing lubrication has shown promise for disease treatment. This project will take a broader
approach to clearly define unique characteristics and other potential functions for these cells that could be
targeted for therapeutic approaches. In particular, this study will focus on interactions of superficial zone cells
with underlying articular chondrocytes. Developmental studies by my sponsor's lab and preliminary data I have
gathered from adult mice provide strong evidence that the superficial zone does not function as a progenitor
population for underlying articular chondrocytes, and instead suggests that superficial cells are unique from
articular chondrocytes. Thus, I hypothesize that superficial zone cells are maintained distinctly in articular
cartilage, but that their coordinated functions with underlying articular chondrocytes promote sustained,
functional organization of articular cartilage. To test this hypothesis, in Aim 1 I will characterize the unique
properties of superficial zone cells during growth and during their response to damage compared to articular
chondrocytes. In Aim 2, I will directly test the requirement of the superficial zone cells in adult animals. In Aim
3, I will explore mechanisms of coordinated functions between superficial cells and articular chondrocytes to
maintain mature articular cartilage structure. I will use multiple analytical tools including histomorphometry,
confocal imaging, and nano-scale mechanical testing in combination with RNA sequencing and in situ
hybridization. Conditional mouse models, including our transgenic Prg4CreER allele to target superficial zone
cells, will be examined at adult stages and following a traumatic injury (DMM-model) that significantly alters
mechanical loading in the joint. The proposed studies will provide essential knowledge on mechanisms that
underlie superficial zone cell functions and responses to damage/altered mechanical load. The data and
insights from the project will prove essential to envision and test future therapeutic joint strategies that target
superficial zone cells, providing broad relevance and importance to the project and offering a solid platform on
which to establish my independent career in biomedical and translational medicine research."
11045519,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
While combination antiretroviral therapy has improved life expectancy for persons with HIV (PWH), cognitive
impairment persists in at least 30% of this population. However, it remains unclear whether brain aging is
accelerated, i.e. whether PWH have neurophenotypes resembling older uninfected (HIV-) controls. It is also
unclear how structural and functional brain aging relate to cognitive decline or preservation in PWH.
 To enable the applicant to address these questions, this revised proposal includes a training plan focused
on further education in HIV clinical problems and practices, infectious disease biology, data analytics, and
scientific professional development. This plan includes mentored learning, clinical shadowing, didactic
coursework, and continuous engagement with an experienced, multi-disciplinary mentorship team. The
applicant’s long-term goals are to better characterize structure-function relationships in brain aging and
neurological infectious disease as an independent investigator performing clinically relevant neuroimaging.
 In the Research Strategy, a multimodal MRI approach is proposed, incorporating both brain structure and
function. This approach will focus on two key neural biomarkers: white matter health and network connectivity.
White matter integrity will be measured with diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) from a large group of de-identified
PWH (n=440) and HIV- controls (n=255). Brain connectivity will be profiled using resting-state functional MRI
(rs-fMRI). DW-MRI and rs-fMRI will be used to generate brain-predicted age, a summary metric representing
systemic degeneration or dysfunction. Brain-predicted age will be calculated using machine learning regression
models, trained to predict participant ages from MRI. Brain-age gap (BAG), the difference between predicted
and chronological age, will be obtained for all participants.
 The central hypothesis is that brain aging, including loss of structural integrity and network connectivity,
is accelerated in PWH, represented by elevated BAG among older PWH vs. HIV- controls. Aim 1 will test whether
age-like white matter degeneration is increased in PWH, while Aim 2 will investigate whether network functional
connectivity is decreased. As this population is at elevated risk for both clinical co-morbidities such as
cardiovascular disease and likely to experience socioeconomic disadvantages, it is critical to quantify the
contribution of such factors to brain aging. Aging with HIV is heterogenous, and many individuals present with
typical or even resilient cognition, so factors predicting successful brain aging should also be identified, especially
modifiable factors. Exploratory Aim 3 will model variability in brain aging among PWH as a function of clinical
variables, demographic and socioeconomic factors, and neuropsychological performance.
 This research plan will provide insights into the origins of HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment, a
major clinical problem that reduces quality-of-life for millions of PWH. Together with the proposed training goals,
it will enable the applicant to obtain skills and knowledge vital for an independent neuroimaging research career."

The project will develop and pilot test a personalized medicine mobile health application, KeepCalm, that
incorporates physiological stress measurement to support evidence-based practices for reducing challenging
behavior in children on the autism spectrum. As much as 80% of children on the autism spectrum exhibit
challenging behaviors that can have a devastating impact on personal and family well-being, contribute to
teacher burnout and require frequent hospitalization. Evidence-based practices for reducing these behaviors
emphasize uncovering triggers, yet parents and teachers often report that challenging behaviors surface without
warning. Challenging behaviors caused by emotion dysregulation can be the most difficult to predict, as children
on the autism spectrum often have difficulty communicating their distress before it results in challenging behavior.
Exciting recent advances in digital technology now allow measurement of momentary emotion dysregulation,
using physiological indices. Our pilot data from four separate samples demonstrate that increased heart rate
predicts onset of challenging behavior in children on the autism spectrum. In order to tailor KeepCalm to end
users and avoid potential barriers to its adoption, in Aim 1, we will evaluate the acceptability, feasibility, and
appropriateness of app, and the needs of educational teams in managing stress in children on the autism
spectrum and challenging behaviors, by conducting interviews with teachers of children on the autism spectrum,
parents of children on the autism spectrum and school administrators, and conducting structured in-class
observations with teachers. Through the activities of Aim 2, we will improve KeepCalm, building on our initial
app prototype, in collaboration with our established technology partner, Alevio, and our established community
partner, the School District of Philadelphia. We will do this through 1) exploratory work on the specificity of heart
rate increase to challenging behavior, on app clinical decision support timing, and on the association of app false
positives and negatives to movement or child factors; 2) monthly advisory board meetings with expert
stakeholders for app development guidance, and; 3) rapid-cycle prototyping of the app with 10 educational teams
(i.e. 1-2 children on the autism spectrum, and their teacher and classroom aide, if they have one). This will allow
for iterative improvement based on each user’s experience. Through Aim 3, we will test the app for usability,
acceptability, feasibility and appropriateness, as well as preliminary effectiveness with 20 educational teams in
a randomized waitlist field trial over a 3-month period. Successful completion of these aims will result in a novel
m-health app designed to help teachers support emotion regulation, and reduce or prevent challenging behavior
in children on the autism spectrum, using evidence-based strategies. These activities will lay the foundation for
an R01 to evaluate the effectiveness of KeepCalm in a full-scale randomized field trial. Our proposal aligns with
the strategic plan of the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee, to maximize the potential for technology-
based interventions to improve the lives of people on the autism spectrum."
11046440,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of the diarrheal
disease cholera, forms biofilm aggregates in the host
intestinal crypts that are critical to disease pathogenesis.
One factor that affects V. cholerae virulence and biofilm
formation is the sensing of nitric oxide (NO), an important
mediator of host immune defense. Intestinal infection with
V. cholerae causes upregulation of inducible NO synthase
in the intestinal epithelium and in intestinal macrophages.
This in turn leads to elevated NO levels in the intestinal
lumen where V. cholerae resides. A better understanding
of the mechanisms involved in V. cholerae's response to
NO is important, since common therapeutics used in
cholera treatment alter host production of NO. V. cholerae
can sense and respond to NO through two major NO-
sensing proteins: Heme nitric oxide/oxygen binding protein Fig. 1. Overview of the project and the collaborative team.
(H-NOX) and NO-sensing protein (NosP). Intriguingly, H-
NOX is thought to promote biofilm formation through indirect inhibition of a phosphodiesterase (PDE), while
NosP is thought to favor biofilm dissolution by inhibition of the quorum sensing histidine kinase (HK) VpsS.
How the two V. cholerae NO-sensors (H-NOX and NosP) in combination affect biofilm formation and
virulence during infection of the host intestinal epithelium is unclear.
 Addressing the complex interplay between host NO production, V. cholerae NO-sensing, NO signaling
pathways, biofilm formation, and the resulting host response requires complementary expertise in mucosal
immunobiology, bacterial signaling pathways, and biofilms. We have assembled a multi-disciplinary team of
mid-career PIs from three INBRE states to undertake this work. The focus of our project on NO-sensing and
biofilm formation in V. cholerae will enable all three PIs to apply their expertise to a new area of investigation
while developing a highly synergistic collaborative project. Dr. Tseng at the University of Nevada Las Vegas
(UNLV) will contribute biofilm expertise that she has gained in studies on Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Dr.
Bimczok at Montana State University (MSU) will contribute her expertise in organoid-immune cell co-culture
models of infection that she has gained in her research on gastric H. pylori infection. Dr. Yukl at New Mexico
State University (NMSU) will contribute his expertise on bacterial NO sensing systems and extend his work to
define relevant signaling pathways downstream of the NO sensors (Fig. 1).
 For this team development project, we aim to, first, establish and validate our experimental model systems,
second, generate preliminary data, and third, strengthen our collaborative interactions. With our proposed
experiments, we will (1) assess in vitro biofilm formation phenotypes of V. cholerae NO-sensing mutants
(Tseng); (2) elucidate how sensing of epithelial and macrophage-derived NO by V. cholerae impacts biofilm
formation and virulence in the context of host cells (Bimczok); and (3) define H-NOX and NosP signaling
pathways in planktonic cultures and biofilms of V. cholerae (Yukl). The proposed studies include discovery-
focused omics approaches (i.e., bacterial and host RNASeq, bacterial proteomics and phosphoproteomics).
This strategy will enable us to identify potential target molecules and pathways in both bacteria and host cells
that we can further explore in hypothesis-driven follow-up studies and proposals. The data to be generated will
enable us to publish a collaborative manuscript and will position us for a successful multi-PI R01 or a
Collaborative Program RM1 application.
 The three PIs are committed to sharing their expertise across the groups, which will benefit both the project
and the breadth of research in all three laboratories. The proposed tri-state collaboration is expected to
generate unique insight into mechanisms of V. cholerae pathogenesis from the perspective of both pathogen
and host. In addition, the project will provide excellent opportunities for training the biomedical workforce at the
undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels. Overall, the proposed work is highly suitable for funding
opportunity NOT-GM-24-001 for Team Science Development Projects. Our project and its future directions are
a clear fit to three out of four thematic focus areas for New Mexico INBRE, specifically Pathogens, Cell and
Organism, and Structure and Function of Biomolecules. It also furthers the stated goals of the New Mexico
INBRE parent award, which are to support multi-disciplinary collaborative research, build and enhance the
biomedical research base through faculty development, and provide student-focused training and research
experiences. Finally, the proteomics and transcriptomics experiments proposed herein will leverage the
relevant core facilities at NV and MT INBRE and the IDeA National Resource for Quantitative Proteomics."

involving three separate but integrated proposals that together investigate the mechanisms by which TBI
enhances impulsivity and suicidal behavior in Veterans. The rationale for the collaborative project is to
combine human biomarker analysis, with human imaging studies, and with neurobiological mechanistic
studies in animals, to understand the manner in which TBI influences impulsivity and suicidal behavior.
Preventing suicide is a major priority for the VA. The overarching hypothesis is that TBI enhances impulsivity, a
risk factor for suicide, particularly in response to stress, through inflammation and dysfunction of the serotonin
system and frontal lobe circuitry.
 At the Indianapolis VA (INDVA) site, in order first to test our overarching hypothesis, and second to gain a
more comprehensive understanding, we propose to translationally integrate human studies of subjects with TBI
and suicidality with animal model studies of TBI, using blood biomarkers as a bridge. This will be accomplished
via the following Aims: Aim 1 is Human biomarker studies. Aim 1.1. will focus on state aspects, by conducting
transcriptomic analyses on blood samples collected in Indianapolis. We will have two groups: suicidality with TBI
(n= 70) and suicidality without TBI (n= 70). We will not be conducting imaging studies, but rather use a
longitudinal design, by testing the subjects first during an acute inpatient psychiatric hospitalization for suicidality
(severe ideation, plan, attempt), and then 3-6 months later for a follow-up visit in a low suicidality state. We
hypothesize that inflammatory and serotonin related transcripts will be decrease between acute inpatient and
non-acute follow-up testing, but less so in suicidality with TBI compared to suicidality without TBI. Aim 1.2. will
focus on trait aspects, by conducting transcriptomic analyses on samples from the Bronx VA (JJPVA) (n=140).
We hypothesize that inflammatory and serotonin related transcripts will be increased most in suicidality with TBI
compared to suicidality without TBI, TBI without suicidality, and non-TBI, non- suicidality. Aim 2 is Animal model
brain and blood biomarkers convergence studies. We will conduct transcriptomic analyses of brain and blood
samples from the animal model studies (n= 160) at the New Jersey VA (VANJHCS), a more experimentally
tractable way of studying TBI and impulsivity. We hypothesize that we will identify biomarkers that are co-
directionally changed in brain and blood. Aim 3 is Translational convergence of human and animal model
biomarker data, using Convergent Functional Genomics analyses. We hypothesize that the candidate state and
trait biomarkers that track suicidality (ideation, attempts) related to TBI (TBI-S) in the human studies will cross-
validate with the brain-blood biomarkers from the animal model studies. We will also test hypothesis driven a
series of known biomarkers related to inflammation (IL6, IFNG), serotonin (5HT2A, SLC6A4), and TBI (UCH-L1,
GFAP- FDA approved in 2018). Exploratory Aim 4 will focus on convergence of biomarkers and phenomic
data (neurobehavioral testing, imaging). We hypothesize that we can link different biomarkers to different
behavioral aspects in the same individual and across individuals, resulting in a better understanding of the
pathophysiological links between TBI, impulsivity, and suicidality. We will use a PhenoChipping approach
(Niculescu et al. 2006)6, that clusters phenomics and genomics data.
 The number of new traumatic brain injury (TBI) cases for U.S. Military forces has more than doubled in the
last five years and will continue to grow. TBI is a risk factor for suicidality. Moreover, increased impulsivity is
one of the most prevalent symptoms following TBI, and is itself a risk factor for suicide, depression and drug
abuse. Thus, finding objective biomarkers of increased risk of suicide and understanding the
mechanisms responsible for high impulsivity following TBI are key to severing the link between TBI and
suicide."
11043201,"Project Summary/Abstract
Human inosine triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase (ITPA) is a protective enzyme that is essential for life. ITPA
hydrolyzes inosine triphosphate (ITP) to the monophosphate form (IMP) to keep the nucleoside triphosphate
from interfering with normal cellular processes and/or incorporation into nucleic acids. The P32T variant of the
enzyme can modulate the results of certain treatments for life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, while the
R178C variant can cause a fatal infantile encephalopathy (DEE 35). Our long-term goal is to develop a drug
that can address this orphan disease (DEE 35) and provide better outcomes for P32T individuals. Experiments
and computer simulations from our previous NIH R15 funding demonstrated that the stability of P32T and R178C
proteins is reduced, catalysis is severely compromised for R178C, and that both mutations disrupted the
structural dynamics of lower lobe helix 2 of the enzyme. These results suggest that a small drug-like molecule
could bind to clinically relevant variants of ITPA to help stabilize the protein. Our specific aims are geared
towards identifying molecules that can reverse these ITPA variants defects. In collaboration with the Molecular
Screening Shared Resource (MSSR) lab at UCLA, we plan to perform molecular docking-based virtual screening
of 300,000 small drug-like molecules of the MSSR library. Our hypothesis is that stabilization of the R178C ITPA
by a library molecule will increase enzyme activity, indicating restored activity. Specific Aim 1 will include in silico
and biochemical chemical library screens. The in silico screening will be performed at Eastern Washington
University (EWU) and the compounds will be ranked based on the binding affinity estimation score. At UCLA, we
will perform high throughput screening (HTS) experiments using a standard biochemical assay to test the
enzymatic activity of R178C ITPA in presence of the top-ranked compounds obtained from the in silico virtual
screening approaches. Data generated from reactions containing library molecules will be statistically evaluated
and those that significantly increase ITPA activity will be considered a “hit” molecule and will be further studied
at EWU using biochemical methods (Specific Aim 2) and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations (Specific Aim
3). The confirmatory biochemistry experiments will include an HPLC-based enzyme assay with wild-type, P32T
and R178C ITPA enzymes. These experiments will provide kinetic parameters and EC50 values, which will help
evaluate each hit molecule and gain insight into how the hit molecule affects enzyme activity. The MD simulations
will confirm the stability of the binding and elucidate the dynamic of the interaction of the hit compounds with the
variants binding site. Undergraduate researchers will take part in every step of the project and participate in
computational and biochemical experiments at EWU and HTS experiments at UCLA. This proposal is innovative
because it explores a new avenue for addressing health issues for patients with ITPA variation. The project is
significant because it will provide a platform for drug discovery to address ITPA defects."
11043961,"Project Summary
 New methods for the formation of carbon-carbon bonds are always at the forefront of organic reaction
development. Of particular interest are those that utilize benign reagents, are atom-economical, and have low
energy input. The projects detailed herein will develop new umpolung carbon-carbon bond forming reactions
with visible-light mediated photocatalysis. Specifically, the projects seek to generate radical species by electron
transfer with ketone-containing functional groups. This reactivity will be enabled by photocatalytic electron
transfer either to or from an activated carbonyl species. Two specific goals will be approached: 1) Initial work will
extend preliminary experimental results that have shown that ketyl radicals can be generated by the combined
activity of photocatalysts and titanium complexes to react unactivated ketones and enones; and 2) electron
transfer from 1,3-dicarbonyls is proposed to generate electrophilic radicals for carbon-carbon bond formation
with nucleophiles. A variety of carbon-carbon bond forming reactions that involve ketyl and 1,3-dicarbonyl
radicals are proposed, including homoaldol additions, enantioselective hydroalkylation, and oxidative enolate
heterocoupling. In total, these new catalytic processes will provide highly efficient methods for the use of visible
light to construct carbon-carbon bonds in complex and biologically relevant molecular settings. The achievement
of the designed umpolung reactivity of carbonyl-containing compounds by single electron reduction or oxidation
would broaden the scope of reactivity for these widely available reagents. As a result, this proposal will contribute
to the general toolbox of carbon-carbon bond forming reactions with new methods that are able to simultaneously
build molecular complexity and adjust oxidation state. The projects are specifically tailored to be carried out by
a research team composed entirely of undergraduates and are therefore divided into discrete individual projects.
This proposal would enhance the research training and outcomes of a diverse group of undergraduates pursuing
careers in the biomedical sciences."
11045184,"Abstract
 On average, a human genome harbors ~27,000 structural variations (SVs), including deletions,
duplications, and other genomic changes over 50 bp in size, which contribute significantly to phenotypic
variations. Recent studies have shown that SVs can disrupt local genome organization known as topologically
associating domains (TADs), resulting in misexpression of neighboring genes and causing developmental
disorders and other diseases. In this project, we study genomic disruptions associated with frontonasal
dysplasia (FND), a congenital craniofacial disorder that profoundly affects the structure and function of the
orofacial complex, as a model for understanding genome organization and molecular mechanisms underlying
craniofacial development and malformations. Several independent studies have associated FND with partly
overlapping heterozygous microdeletions at Chromosome 2p21 in which SIX2 is the only protein-coding gene.
SIX2 is a member of the SIX- and homeo-domain containing DNA-binding transcription factors. In all
vertebrate genomes, Six2 is physically linked to Six3 in a tail-to-tail configuration, with these two genes
organized into separate TADs flanking a conserved TAD boundary. Six2, but not Six3, is abundantly
expressed in the cranial neural crest cell (CNCC) derived frontonasal mesenchyme and in nephrogenic
mesenchyme during mouse embryogenesis. Whereas Six2+/- mice are phenotypically normal and Six2-/- mice
exhibit kidney hypoplasia with normal frontonasal structures, our preliminary study found that deleting Six2
together with part of the Six2/Six3 intergenic region, but not including the Six3 gene or Six2 distal enhancers,
caused midline facial clefting in heterozygous mice. On the other hand, mice carrying a heterozygous deletion
including Six2, Six3, and their intergenic region in between, could survive with no frontonasal defects. We
hypothesize that SIX2-related FND is caused by gain of SIX3 expression in developing frontonasal
mesenchyme due to TAD boundary disruption and enhancer adoption rather than by SIX2 haploinsufficiency
as previously believed. This project will test this novel hypothesis and unravel the genomic and molecular
developmental mechanisms underlying SIX2-related FND. Data from these studies will provide novel insights
into mechanisms of craniofacial development and functional divergence of the SIX family transcription factors,
and lead to improvements in molecular diagnosis, medical assessment and interpretation of clinical genomics
data, and treatment/care of SV-associated developmental disorders."

Background
Survival rates for children with solid tumors, including brain, have largely plateaued
over the past three decades making them the most common cause of disease-related
mortality in this age group. After decades of optimizing chemotherapy and
radiotherapy protocols, higher cure rates for childhood solid tumors will no longer be
achieved by “more of the same.” Rather, cures will require innovative interventions
that specifically target the unique biology of these tumors, which are often driven by
oncogenic fusions and other pediatric-specific oncoproteins historically considered
difficult drug targets. With advances in targeted protein degradation and chemical
interventions to inhibit protein-protein interactions, it has recently become tractable to
target these proteins previously thought to be “undruggable”. Moreover, unbiased
functional screening approaches, such as CRISPR-Cas9, have revealed new
pediatric cancer synthetic lethal liabilities in need of targeted inhibitors.
Aims
We aim to lead the transformation of delivering such specific treatments to our young
patients harnessing the power of a highly interdisciplinary and collaborative team of
world-leading experts in pediatric oncology, targeted protein degradation, high-
throughput chemical screening, medicinal chemistry, structural biology, tumor
biology, preclinical drug testing, and clinical trials, complemented by a trans-Atlantic
group of engaged patient representatives.
Methods
A bold plan will be pursued with a portfolio of projects that balance very high-risk
efforts with others nearing clinical implementation. We will focus on drivers/targets in
the following diseases: Ewing sarcoma, neuroblastoma, synovial sarcoma,
ependymoma and high-grade glioma. We will explore different approaches to target
these as yet undrugged paediatric drivers/dependencies, to overcome resistance to
available targeted inhibitors, and to improve the efficacy and therapeutic window of
CAR-T treatments.
How the results will be used
The aspiration of our team is to establish a sustainable platform for repeated
developmental cycles of paediatric-specific drug development for emerging targets
including a viable financial model to de-risk such developments for such rare
pediatric tumors to the direct benefit of our patients. Specifically, we anticipate
success through (i) delivering at least one optimised protein degrader for its
application in early-phase clinical trials, (ii) enabling the druggability of previously
“undruggable” targets, (iii) providing mechanistic insights into disease, novel targets,
and therapy resistance mechanisms and ways to tackle them."
11047032,"Stark, Ruth E. Molecular Drivers of FABP-mediated Endocannabinoid Signaling for Appetite Regulation
[unchanged from original proposal submission]
 Metabolic signaling by endogenous cannabinoids (ECs) is essential to the regulation of human
appetite, pain, and neuroprotection. Fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) can either sequester the
hydrophobic ECs or transport them to hydrolytic enzymes; ECs routed to the nucleus also activate the
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). EC levels have been correlated with obesity in
knockout mice for liver (L) FABP that is co-expressed with intestinal (I) FABP in enterocytes and also for
PPARa knockouts, underscoring the regulatory roles of these proteins. We will probe poorly understood
EC-FABP, EC-PPAR, and FABP-EC-PPAR complexes in vitro at near-physiological concentrations,
determining affinities, metabolic fates, molecular binding interfaces, and conformational changes to test
mechanistic hypotheses regarding EC signaling. Trainees at multiple career stages, including those
recruited from underrepresented groups in STEM, will be integrally involved in this research program.
 Specific questions to be addressed are as follows: (1) How do ECs choose between FABP
chaperones to produce obese or lean outcomes? The possibility that ECs are delivered by LFABP to
hydrolytic enzymes for metabolic breakdown rather than sequestered by IFABP in the enterocyte will be
tested enzymatically, whereas the rationale for LFABP’s diminished affinity will be explored using high-
pressure solution-state NMR to identify energetically favored candidate sites for binding. (2) Could
transcriptional activity be driven by EC binding preferences for LFABP vs. PPARa? The PPARa
ligand-binding domain (PPARa_LBD) will be purified, rigorously delipidated, and tested in vitro for EC-
modulated transcriptional activity. EC binding affinities will be compared for PPARa_LBD and FABPs.
(3) Could transcriptional activity be driven by EC-modulated FABP-PPAR collisions that cause
conformational changes? To determine the interactions involved in the proposed FABP-mediated EC
activation of PPARa transcriptional function, we will first use surface plasmon resonance to measure the
binding affinity of LFABP-PPARa_LBD protein complexes, on their own and in the presence of ligands
with a range of known activation efficacies. The site-specific collision-associated impact on the LFABP
partner will be probed by solution-state NMR spectroscopy of the [U-15N]-enriched protein, using chemical
shift perturbations of each backbone NH resonance to define the binding interface with PPARa_LBD, any
allosteric structural changes that occur upon complex formation, and their modulation by EC ligands. Taken
together, these experiments will advance our understanding of (macro)molecular networks that function to
achieve metabolic signaling by ECs involved in appetite and pain regulation, thereby advancing our
understanding of health risks related to obesity and inflammation. This understanding can guide the design
of drugs that modulate these biomedically important ligand-protein and protein-protein interactions.

11047413,"SAMBAI: Societal, Ancestry, Molecular and Biological Analyses of Inequalities
Research Abstract
Background
Prostate, breast, and pancreatic cancers all have a disproportionately higher rate of aggressive tumor
grade and early onset in Black patients, with recent spikes of high incidence in West African nations
compared to other African regions. The genetic background correlations implicate predispositions.
Members of our SAMBAI team of investigators have pioneered genomics in cancer disparities research,
and over the past two decades, we have uncovered compelling evidence of distinct immunological
mechanisms associated with genetic ancestry. Our SAMBAI team members have developed methods to
quantify environmental exposures and interrogate the lived experiences of marginalized populations,
including epigenetic responses to racism.
Aims
We will partner with scientists across the US, Africa, and the UK to build an unprecedented resource, the
SAMBAI Biobank and Data Repository for Cancer Equity Research. We will generate a comprehensive,
accurate, and relevant measurement of social, environmental, genetic, and immunological factors to
complete an integrated set of analyses to define the causal vs. modifier relationships of disparate
outcomes in diverse underserved populations. We will establish a sustainable framework for team science
approaches with under-represented partners and establish best practices for coordinating cancer equity
research on a global scale.
Methods
We propose to utilize multiple methods across our different work packages. Social Determinants include
self-reporting surveys and database abstractions. Exposomes utilize mass spectrometry of plasma.
Genomics will utilize three sequencing methods on germline and tumor tissue, including long read,
short/deep, and ultra-low pass whole genome sequencing. Lastly, immunological profiles will be
measured with spatial transcriptomics and circulating multiplex immunoassays. These data require novel
computational frameworks, including cloud-based virtualization and the use of machine learning
technologies to identify novel associations across the strata of social to spatial data elements and across
our diverse geographic and ancestral SAMBAI cohorts.
Utility and Impact
We will improve research capacity in under-resourced environments for large-scale cancer research and
equitable access to data with equitable feasibility to improve treatment and outcomes. We will define
interactions of environmental exposures, social determinants, and genetic ancestry that determine
immunological landscapes of primary tumors and/or circulating immunological profiles in patients of
African descent. Our project will contribute a data repository with 100K features/patient, for 40,000
patients. The impact on this population includes a novel trial design, in collaboration with our patient
advocacy partners, to ensure that the specific genomic and immunological features we uncover become
part of targeted precision oncology theragnostic options."
11048292,"Project Summary/Abstract
Voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels are associated with cardiovascular, neurological, and psychiatric
disorders and are the molecular targets of widely used antiarrhythmic, anticonvulsant drugs. Our project aims
to study the structural dynamics of the human Nav1.5 channel, which generates action potentials in
cardiomyocytes and is associated with life-threatening arrhythmias. High-resolution structures of many voltage-
gated sodium channels, including Nav1.5, have revealed the molecular details of selectivity filter pores, voltage
sensors, and drug-binding sites. Recently, NavAb structures chemically locked at the resting and activating
states were obtained by cryo-EM, providing a molecular framework to understand the structural basis of
voltage sensing and gating. Based on these high-resolution structures, my project proposed investigating the
dynamic behaviors of Nav channel structures using the cutting-edge single-molecule fluorescence resonance
energy transfer (smFRET) technique. We aim to uncover the conformational changes and kinetics of Nav
channels at critical sites, including selectivity filters, voltage sensors, and drug binding sites, which are vital to
understanding how Nav channels select Na+ over other cations, how membrane voltages alter the
conformational landscape of voltage sensors to gate channel pores, and how drug molecules alter Nav
structures to modulate their function. SmFRET measurements on Nav channels, proposed as key studies in
my project, are currently performed on a customized total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscope in
my lab. This proposal seeks support to acquire the Nano-imager (Oxford Nano-Imaging Inc), an automatic
microscope that integrates hardware, control, and analysis software to perform more robust smFRET studies.
The autofocus system, the piezo stage, and the temperature controller built into the Nanoimager will allow us
to resolve conformational dynamics as fast as 1 millisecond, obtain accurate FRET efficiency measurements
for structural modeling, and even examine conformational dynamics of voltage-gated ion channels in living
cells. Moreover, the Nano-imager eliminates complex hardware alignments and software settings required by
my customized TIRF microscope, so even fresh undergraduate students can be trained to work on it within 2
days. In summary, acquiring the Nanoimager will significantly boost our research productivity in the following 3
project years and broadly impact UMKC students by providing them with hands-on experience with this cutting-
edge research equipment."
11049568,"ABSTRACT
Our vision is to unravel and ultimately reverse the intricate network of causal factors throughout the life course
that disrupts biological homeostasis to promote colorectal cancer (CRC) among individuals younger than age 50
years. Uniting leading scientific minds in early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC) research and complementary
fields, we have embraced disruptive, transdisciplinary approaches spanning cells to individuals to populations to
address the core Grand Challenge to “Determine why the incidence of early-onset cancers is rising globally”. We
will address specific questions of “the mechanisms linking lifetime exposures with cancer initiation and
promotion” by focusing on EOCRC as an ideal model for early-onset cancer due to the availability of well-
characterized animal models and well-established and prevalent precursor lesion, the adenomatous polyp
(adenoma), offering a unique opportunity for interception and prevention. Our work will transform the field by
directly addressing our overarching goal to “identify and understand the processes through which different
biological and environmental factors cause early-onset cancers”, and reverse the burden in a timely, effective,
feasible, inclusive fashion. Our team, both working independently and in collaboration, has uncovered several
risk factors that are likely to be drivers for the rising incidence for EOCRC. We are now uniquely positioned to
translate etiologic understanding to actionable prevention by identifying novel factors, including environmental
and social determinants, and deepening our understanding into overlooked dimensions of exposure throughout
the life course. The unprecedented scope and scale of our proposal can only be supported through Cancer
Grand Challenges since our “high-risk” disruptive approach requires deep interactions between work packages
(WP)s led by leaders in diverse disciplines. This will enable incorporation of fresh perspectives to move beyond
traditional risk-factor epidemiology toward an integrated, mechanistically-informed model with population scale
and cellular resolution of the multiple and cumulative “hits” that promote EOCRC to inform the development of
actionable prevention. Our innovations intersect epidemiology, small molecule discovery, genomics, stem cell
biology, immunology, and computational biology with these key features: 1) harmonization of diverse cohorts
with data and biospecimens collected across the lifecourse; 2) innovative and reliable analysis of small molecules
to detect novel exposures; 3) high-resolution technologies for analysis of target tissues; 4) model systems
capable of interrogating accumulating exposures across the lifespan and their impact on the cellular ecosystem;
5) prevention through risk assessment and pharmacologic/lifestyle interventions. Collectively, our work will serve
as an exemplar for transforming research into other early-onset cancers."

11044973,"The long-term goal of this project is to improve mobility, functional independence, and quality of life in
patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) by using specially designed assistive shoes. PAD is a
manifestation of systemic atherosclerosis producing blockages in the leg arteries, resulting in insufficient blood
flow to the lower extremities. Limb ischemia from PAD is the most common disorder treated within the vascular
surgical service of the Omaha Veterans Affairs Medical Center. PAD also accounts for one-third of the operations
performed nationwide in the VA. Walking induced muscle pain known as intermittent claudication is the most
common PAD symptom. Claudicating patients with PAD walk slower, have reduced quality of life and lose
independence in performing activities of daily living. We have identified consistent deficits of the ankle
plantarflexors to effectively push-off during walking. Currently, there is a critical treatment gap for patients whose
disease presentation does not warrant an operative approach, but who desire to restore their functional
independence and walking ability. Specially designed assistive shoes (carbon fiber: CF; spring-loaded: SL) with
specific mechanical properties to absorb and release energy, have been shown to promote push-off efficiency
in walkers and runners. These shoes may lead to improved push-off in populations with reduced ankle push-off
capacity, but this has not been tested yet. This work proposes to evaluate patient preferences in terms of using
assistive shoes and whether these shoes improve walking performance in claudicating patients with PAD. We
hypothesize that assistive shoes (CF and SL) will lead to improved walking performance in patients with PAD as
compared to standard shoes. We also hypothesize that subject reported preference of assistive shoes (CF and
SL) will be positive based on comfort, fatigue, ease of walking, and feasibility. These hypotheses will be tested
by the following three specific aims:
Aim 1: Determine the acute improvement in walking performance (claudication walking distances,
vertical ground reaction force, and muscle oxygenation) in patients with PAD while using their standard
shoes versus the assistive shoes.
Aim 2: Determine the subject-reported preference of assistive shoes.
Aim 3: Determine the progressive improvements in physical activity, quality of life, and walking distance
after a three-month assistive shoe intervention.
Twenty patients with PAD will be recruited for Aims 1 and 2. For Aim 1, each subject will walk on a pressure
instrumented treadmill while performing a progressive treadmill test with a near infrared spectroscopy sensor on
the calf for each shoe condition: i) standard, ii) CF, and iii) SL. Walking performance will be evaluated in terms
of claudication walking distances, vertical ground reaction force, and muscle oxygenation. All outcomes will be
compared across these three types of shoes. Aim 2 will primarily focus on qualitative measurements of subject
reported preference to identify whether assistive shoes are feasible for patients with PAD to use. Visual-analog
scales, rate of perceived exertion, and interviews will be used to assess comfort, fatigue, intensity, and feasibility
after each condition of Aim 1. Five patients from Aims 1 and 2 who are satisfied with CL and another five who
are satisfied with SL, will be recruited for Aim 3. Patients will wear the assistive shoes of their choice for regular
daily use for three months as a conservative intervention. Physical activity, quality of life, and walking distances
will be assessed prior to the start of the intervention and after three months of intervention. Overall, our aims will
demonstrate feasibility and acceptability of assistive shoes in patients with PAD. Results will support a full clinical
trial, and guide necessary intervention length and potential rehabilitation recommendations."
11044974,"Background: Fall-related hospitalizations and consequent morbidity and mortality continue to rise despite the
availability for over two decades of evidence-based fall-prevention programs. This is a major problem since
more than 2.5 million older adults are treated annually for fall-related injuries in the US. Fall-prevention
programs focusing on strength and balance exercises have been successful in facility settings but exercise
programs are ineffective at home due to lack of adherence. Estimates indicate that only 1 in 5 individuals
adhere to home exercise programs for fall prevention. Thus, there is an urgent need to improve adherence to
exercise performed at home by older adults seeking to improve balance for the sake of fall prevention.
Behavioral interventions have failed to consistently improve adherence to exercise. Biological reasons for poor
exercise adherence, such as executive dysfunction, have not been explored. Adherence to long-term exercise
is dependent on executive function (EF), which is controlled by the [dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)] of
the brain. EF influences choices in scheduling, forgoing competing activities, enduring subtle costs of time and
inconvenience, and the ability to delay gratification. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a
non-invasive neuromodulation increasingly used for neural network specific interventions. rTMS of the DLPFC
improves EF, memory, motivation, and mental flexibility. rTMS studies to date have stimulated the motor cortex
for gait and balance improvements. The role of DLPFC in exercise adherence has not been explored. The
proposed study will be the first to test DLPFC stimulation for improving exercise adherence.
Objective: The study objective is to determine the effects of rTMS treatment of the dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex compared to sham on: [1. Short-term (2-wk) changes in executive function;] 2. Long-term (24-wk)
adherence to a home-based exercise program; 3. Long-term (24-wk) changes in balance and gait; and [4.
Short-term (2-wk) changes in self-efficacy and delay discounting.]
Methods: Sedentary community-dwelling older Veterans (age ≥ 65 years, [N=106]) will participate in a double-
blind randomized sham-controlled three-phase study. The proposed study will use Nintendo Wii-Fit exercises.
Phase I will include two weeks of facility-based exercise for safety assessment and learning the program,
followed by 12 weeks of home-based exercises. [Subjects with poor adherence and those with good
adherence with low EF] will then be randomized to rTMS or sham treatments. Phase II will include ten
consecutive weekdays of rTMS or sham treatment along with exercise training for subjects with poor
adherence [and for those with good adherence and low EF] and continuation of home-based exercises for
those with good adherence and EF. Phase III includes 24-weeks of a home-based exercise program. All
subjects will exercise for 45 minutes five days/week. [Objective measure of adherence collected from Wii-Fit
console and Conner’s continuous performance test for EF will be the primary outcome measures.] Balance
and gait will be assessed. [Self-efficacy, delay discounting along with fear of falls, and falls incidence will be
assessed. Outcome measures will be assessed at baseline, and at 14, 16, and 40 weeks.]
Significance: This project will have a major impact in improving adherence to an exercise program and in turn,
improve balance in sedentary community-dwelling older Veterans. At the end of the proposed project, we will
gain knowledge about the efficacy of rTMS in improving EF and exercise adherence. Knowledge gained about
the adherence to home-based exercises would be applicable to multiple conditions such as diabetes. Since
Wii-Fit and rTMS are readily available, translation of the study results to clinical practice would be expeditious."
11045205,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections (intestinal worms) affect 1.5 billion individuals
globally. Recent evidence from trials and modeling studies suggests that community-wide mass
drug administration (cMDA) of deworming medication with sufficient coverage and adherence
can eliminate STH transmission. However, in settings with ongoing environmental transmission
and low coverage of networked sanitation, persistent environmental reservoirs of STH eggs
result in high reinfection rates, and hinder progress towards elimination.
 STH control programs use human stool-based methods to assess STH prevalence and
intensity in endemic settings. However, individual stool sampling is expensive and logistically
difficult, particularly when human infection prevalence is low. If collecting and analyzing soil from
locations in communities with high human activity (e.g. home entrances, water collection points,
schools) were established to be equally or more sensitive than human stool diagnostics, this
approach may represent a less invasive and more cost-effective surveillance tool for MDA
program monitoring and evaluation.
 This study will leverage a multi-country cluster-randomized controlled trial delivering
three-years of biannual cMDA in Benin and India (DeWorm3). The trial will collect and analyze
by qPCR, human stool samples 24 months (n=80,000 in total) after the final round of cMDA,
which will yield highly accurate human STH infection prevalence estimates in the study areas.
Through extensive laboratory studies and field testing in India and Benin, our team has
developed a sensitive and specific molecular method for detecting STH environmental DNA
(eDNA) in large volumes of soil. We will nest soil sampling within the trial at the same time point
as human stool collection and one year later with the specific aims to: 1) Quantify the effect of a
biannual cMDA intervention on the soil STH reservoir; 2) Determine whether soil STH eDNA
levels can predict community-level human STH infection prevalence; and 3) Develop the optimal
soil sampling strategy and compare costs to human stool-based surveillance.
 Pairing soil STH eDNA assessments with human infection prevalence data already
being collected by the DeWorm3 trial is a unique and time sensitive opportunity to validate and
test the utility of environmental STH surveillance. Our findings will also contribute to
understanding the conditions under which MDA program integration with improved sanitation
interventions is needed for achieving sustained reductions in STH infection prevalence."
11042914,"African American (AA) women presents with aggressive metastatic subtype of triple negative breast cancer
(TNBC) compared to other ethnicities and experience greater mortality rates. Although health care disparities
contribute to poor prognosis in AA women but a race-specific genetic component to TNBC disparity cannot be
ruled out. Thus, racially-segregated genetic determinant underlying TNBC disparity remains an unmet clinical
need. This project is built upon our novel findings suggesting that an oncogenic tripartite motif-containing
protein 37 (TRIM37) protein predisposes AA women to highly aggressive TNBC. We demonstrate that 1)
TRIM37 associates with metastatic phenotype and overall survival in TNBC patients, 2) TRIM37 is expressed
at higher level in the breast and TNBC tumor tissue of AA women relative to other races, 3) TRIM37-
associated single nucleotide polymorphism correlates with high TRIM37 expression in AA women, 4) TRIM37
regulates genes and pathways involved in metastasis cascade, such as promoting survival in circulation, 5) AA
TNBC cells showed increased dependency on oncogenic TRIM37 compared to non-AA TNBC cell lines in vitro
and in vivo, 6) TRIM37 depletion reduces distant infiltration and growth in metastasis murine model 7) TRIM37
inhibition using targeted nanoparticles-based delivery of TRIM37-specific antisense oligonucleotides reduces
TNBC tumor growth. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that higher TRIM37 levels in AA women gives a
would-be cancer cell a “head start” by creating a pre-metastatic niche. This hypothesis will be tested in three
specific aims. In aim 1, we will evaluate TRIM37-allelic variants, that we have already identified, through small-
scale phenotypic screen based on anoikis resistance. We will also determine the mechanism of TRIM37-allelic
variants by comparing the biological activity of TRIM37 risk and reference alleles. In aim 2, we will compare
and contrast the relative contribution of TRIM37 to TNBC metastatic potential in race-dependent manner. We
will also track association between TRIM37 and its transcriptional signatures with race, metastasis incidence,
and patient's survival using disease-free and tumor tissue from TNBC patients. In aim 3, we will compare the
metastatic potential of TRIM37-depleted and TRIM37 overexpressing race-specific breast and TNBC cells
using spontaneous metastasis murine models. Finally, we will test newly engineered TNBC selective
therapeutic platform to inhibit TRIM37 using spontaneous metastasis, race-specific patient-derived xenografts
and humanized murine models. Together, the proposed studies will demonstrate that TRIM37 is a genetic
variant associated with high TNBC risk in AA women and proof-of-concept results will establish the clinical
relevance of inhibiting TRIM37 for TNBC treatment."

Understanding how T cell receptors (TCRs) see tumor antigens presented by MHCs is necessary to fully
understand how the immune system recognizes tumor antigens, and to reap the full potential of antigen-specific
immunotherapy. To achieve this goal, a quantum leap forward is required in which the revolutionary advances in
machine learning are combined with a large volume of structure, function, data on matched TCR-pMHC pairs.
The development of accurate predictors of TCR-antigen recognition will be dependent on the creation and
integration sequencing-based datasets with high-throughput structural and functional insights. Our proposal,
submitted as a CRUK/NCI Grand Challenge team (MATCHMAKERS) will combine researchers with expertise in
immunology, methods development, structural biology, and computation to enable generalized prediction and
design of TCR recognition. This work will be spread across four Work Packages (WPs):
WP1: Large-scale generation of TCR-pMHC pairs from naturally occurring sources. We will build datasets of
naturally occurring TCR-pMHC pairs. Our team will use an array of approaches to collect these datasets, from
humans and from mouse models, and in the context of both cancer and immunity more generally.
WP2: Ultra-high throughput TCR-pMHC matching using molecular engineering. Efforts to create general models
will require a broader array of data than feasible to collect from natural TCR systems. We will use an array of
synthetic approaches developed by our team to comprehensively match TCRs with pMHCs to train
computational models.
WP3: Large-scale structural and biochemical analyses of TCR-pMHC interactions. A key to our team’s vision is
to match interaction datasets with high throughput structural and functional insights. A deep understanding of
how the TCR contacts with MHC helices control function and orientation will be essential for training and testing
computational models.
WP4 AI-based prediction and design of TCR-pMHC interactions. We will integrate our data to train next-
generation algorithms capable of generally predicting and designing TCR-pMHC interactions. These predictions
will proceed through a reiterative testing and feedback circuits for further model optimization."

The goal of this proposal is to extend my training as an independent scientist in the field of hepatic manifestations
of Sickle cell disease (SCD). To this end, I have selected the division of Hematology-Oncology at University of
Pittsburgh to continue my transition to become an independent investigator at an academic institution. This
proposal outlines an extensive Research Strategy that is complemented by several areas of training, which
includes several courses directly related to my studies in Specific Aims, meeting with my junior faculty research
committee, and attendance and participation of multiple seminars throughout the University Of Pittsburgh
Medical School. My Research Strategy will determine the molecular mechanisms of SCD induced hepatic crisis.
SCD is an autosomal-recessive monogenic disorder that affects approximately 100,000 Americans and millions
of people worldwide. Sinusoidal vaso-occlusion and hemolysis are considered as chief contributors of sickle
hepatic crisis. Hepatic crisis affects 10-40% of hospitalized SCD patients which is characterized by liver injury
and sickle cell intrahepatic cholestasis (SCIC) that can progress to fatal liver failure. The current treatment for
hepatic crisis is primarily supportive, and the molecular mechanism is unknown, suggesting that preventive
therapies based on the improved understanding of the molecular pathways that enable SCIC are needed.
In this study, we have used a transgenic, humanized mouse model of SCD that exclusively expresses sickle
human hemoglobin. Preliminary findings reveal that SCD mice developed chronic liver injury with age, which
was manifested by sustained inflammation, hyperbilirubinemia and cholestasis. Using our recently developed
real-time in vivo imaging of the intact liver of live mice, we discovered the presence of sinusoidal ischemia and
impaired bile transport across the apical membrane of hepatocytes in SCD mice. The impaired bile transport
was associated with loss of apical bile transporters (BSEP, ABCG5 and ABCG8) from hepatocytes. RNA-seq
analysis identified dysregulation of genes encoding proteins responsible for inflammation and bile secretion in
the liver of SCD mice. Furthermore, we observed NF-κB activation in the liver of SCD mice inhibited FXR
signaling and its downstream targets, leading to impaired bile secretion. These findings form the basis for my
overarching hypothesis that ischemia and hemolysis induced inflammation, tissue injury and oxidative stress
promotes NF-kB activation in sickle hepatocytes which inhibits FXR signaling leading to impaired bile secretion
in SCD, and activating FXR or rescuing bile secretion can ameliorate SCIC. This hypothesis will be tested in the
following aims: 1) To determine whether ischemia-reperfusion injury and hemolysis promotes hepatocyte specific
activation of NF-kB in SCD and 2) To determine whether hepatocyte-specific activation of NF-kB promotes loss
of FXR-signaling leading to impaired bile secretion and cholestasis in SCD. The successful completion of this
NIH-K01 training award will set the stage for an RO1 proposal aimed at elucidating how the manipulation of
inflammatory pathways, FXR signalling and bile secretion can rescue SCIC and progressive liver injury in SCD."
11047178,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This is a competing revision for the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) CFAR to permit continued support for
our AFRICURE program, originally funded as a CFAR supplement in 2023. The AFRICURE program draws
upon three major strengths of the CFAR: mentorship of new investigators, HIV cure research, and HIV studies
based in sub-Saharan Africa. Despite years of antiretroviral therapy, viral reservoirs persist in individuals living
with HIV-1, resulting in viral rebound if treatment is interrupted. Difficulties of sustained life‐long treatment in
the millions of people living with HIV worldwide, with a significant burden in sub-Saharan Africa, necessitates
research that moves us closer to a sterilizing or functional cure for HIV. Sub-Saharan Africa shoulders a
disproportionate burden of the HIV epidemic globally, making it an important region in which to conduct HIV
cure research. Yet most potential therapeutic strategies are not being designed or tested with most people
living with HIV in mind. There is an urgent need to bring novel insights and approaches rooted in Africa into
HIV cure research to address African HIV subtypes, the unique biologic characteristics of African female and
male populations, and other pressing, but neglected, research areas. The goal of this proposal is to expand the
capacity of the AFRICURE program to recruit, mentor, and support early- and mid-career African investigators
to address Africa-specific biologic, therapeutic, and implementation issues in HIV cure research. The
AFRICURE program will be integrated into the JHU CFAR Development Core and coordinated through the
Inter-CFAR Sub-Saharan Africa Working Group. The program will award one-year, mentored developmental
awards to promising early- and mid-career African investigators to conduct HIV cure research projects. The
specific aims are to: 1) identify and recruit early- and mid-career African investigators to conduct innovative
HIV cure research in Africa; 2) provide mentorship and career development for African HIV cure investigators;
and 3) evaluate the impact of the AFRICURE program. We will identify and recruit exceptional early- and mid-
career African investigators, with a focus on individuals representing diverse backgrounds, experiences, and
geographical locations within the region. The program will foster mentorship collaborations between the
selected African investigators and established HIV cure researchers across CFARs in the United States and
research institutions in Africa, facilitating knowledge exchange and skill development. We will evaluate the
impact of the program on the careers of early- and mid-career African investigators, institutional capacities and
infrastructure to conduct HIV cure research, and contributions to scientific advancement and the integration of
African perspectives in HIV cure research strategies. The AFRICURE program addresses the critical need for
inclusivity and diversity in HIV cure research by fostering a new generation of African investigators. Through
collaborative efforts, this program aims to contribute to advancing HIV cure strategies that are contextually
relevant to the diverse populations most affected by the epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa."
11042592,"Stem cells are responsible for homeostasis and repair of many tissues in the body, and stem cell exhaustion
is one of the hallmarks of aging. In recent years, work from our group and others has drawn attention to the
mechanisms by which the resilience of muscle stem cells (MuSCs) declines with age at the population level and
at the single cell level. As one example, we have shown that a signaling pathway involving Notch activation and
increased p53 activity prevents MuSCs from undergoing a form of cell death, mitotic catastrophe, as they
activated out of quiescence and enter the cell cycle. This Notch/p53 axis declines with age and leads to an
increased propensity of aged MuSCs to undergo mitotic catastrophe, leading to a decline in MuSCs over time.
Furthermore, in preliminary studies, we have found that quiescent MuSCs exhibit evidence of replicative stress
and that an ATR response to that stress prevents cell cycle entry and preserves the MuSC population. We have
also found that dietary interventions, in particular fasting and a ketogenic diet, enhance MuSC resilience, perhaps
mediated by HDAC activity and p53 acetylation. Together, these observations highlight robust processes to
maintain MuSC resilience and prevent stem cell depletion, processes that go awry during the aging process.
The primary goals of this proposal are to explore these processes in more detail, to identify the molecular
mediators of each, to use unbiased screens to identify as yet unknown mediators, and to pursue rejuvenating
interventions that restore resiliency to aged MuSCs.
 To address these issues, this proposal is divided into three Specific Aims. Aim 1: To examine changes of
the Notch/p53 axis as a cause of the age-related reduction of MuSC resilience. We will use novel genetic models
to modulate Notch signaling in MuSCs and test for resilience signatures of cells protected against mitotic
catastrophe. We will also assess resilient cells for evidence of mediators downstream of p53 using single cell
RNA-seq. Aim 2: To examine replicative stress and the ATR response in young and old MuSCs. We will examine
a potential downstream mediator of ATR, CDK12, identified in a phosphoproteomic screen, in preserving
resilience of the population. We will also test whether this replicate stress response pathway changes with age
and protect MuSCs from undergoing mitotic catastrophe when they activate out of quiescence. Aim 3: To
elucidate the mechanisms by which ketosis promotes MuSC resilience. We will test for enhancement of resilience
using three different ketosis-inducing interventions, and we will test for mechanisms of action based on the well-
documented role of the major circulating ketone body, beta-hydroxybutyrate (βHB), as an inhibitor of histone
deacetylases (HDACs). We will also test whether ketosis enhances MuSC resilience, at least in part, by
promoting p53 activity and preventing mitotic catastrophe. Together, these studies will advance our
understanding of the mechanisms of stem cell resiliency and how to enhance the resilience of aged stem cells
to promote tissue homeostasis and repair across the lifespan."

independent mental health services researcher focused on improving services for parents with mental illness. I
am a PhD-trained clinical social worker and tenure-track Assistant Professor at Portland State University, with
a background in providing mental health services to parents and families. I am completing an Institutional K12
Award to study the mental health needs of parents in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). This K08 Award
will build off my qualitative research and advance my research career by providing protected time, mentorship,
and structured support to 1) learn implementation science methods, 2) increase my understanding of
integrated mental health services, 3) obtain skills to conduct rigorous randomized control trials, including
statistical methods necessary to analyze results, and 4) gain the skills necessary to become a leader in the
field of parent mental health services research. My multidisciplinary mentorship team brings expertise in
deployment-focused and participatory methods, health services research, implementation science, parent
mental health research, randomized control trials, health economics, health informatics, rural health, and
biostatistics. Parents of NICU-hospitalized preterm infants are at extremely high risk for mental health
conditions with potentially devastating consequences. Yet, perinatal systems of care do not systematically
support NICU parent mental health. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and state-level Maternal
Mortality Review Committees have called upon perinatal systems of care to prioritize parent mental health. The
objectives of this proposal are to develop and pilot test a telehealth-based mental health screening and
engagement program that supports parents as they transition from the NICU to home. The program will use a
stepped-care approach to screen parents for depression, anxiety, and PTSD; provide a brief behavioral
intervention to those who screen as having at least a low risk of these conditions; and provide a warm hand-off
to community mental health services for those at medium to high risk. We will achieve the study objectives by
meeting 3 specific aims: 1) to use a RE-AIM framework to develop the program in collaboration with former
NICU parents and NICU and primary care stakeholders; 2) to conduct an iterative case series to work out
practical implementation details and logistics, refine the mental health screening and engagement program,
and qualitatively assess purported mechanisms of action; and 3) to conduct a pilot randomized control trial to
assess the program's acceptability and feasibility; to test its preliminary efficacy in targeting mental health self-
efficacy and other potential mechanisms of action; and to better understand facilitators to adoption,
implementation, and maintenance. The proposed activities will provide preliminary data and allow for the
refinement of data collection procedures necessary for an R01 application to conduct a Type 1 hybrid
effectiveness/implementation trial in multiple NICUs across the U.S."
11046871,"Title: PROTECT – Harnessing PROTEin degradation for Advanced Childhood Tumors
Abstract:
Background
Survival rates for children with solid tumors, including brain, have largely plateaued over the past three
decades making them the most common cause of disease-related mortality in this age group. After
decades of optimizing chemotherapy and radiotherapy protocols, higher cure rates for childhood solid
tumors will no longer be achieved by “more of the same.” Rather, cures will require innovative
interventions that specifically target the unique biology of these tumors, which are often driven by
oncogenic fusions and other pediatric-specific oncoproteins historically considered difficult drug targets.
With advances in targeted protein degradation and chemical interventions to inhibit protein-protein
interactions, it has recently become tractable to target these proteins previously thought to be
“undruggable”. Moreover, unbiased functional screening approaches, such as CRISPR-Cas9, have revealed
new pediatric cancer synthetic lethal liabilities in need of targeted inhibitors.
Aims
We aim to lead the transformation of delivering such specific treatments to our young patients harnessing
the power of a highly interdisciplinary and collaborative team of world-leading experts in pediatric
oncology, targeted protein degradation, high-throughput chemical screening, medicinal chemistry,
structural biology, tumor biology, preclinical drug testing, and clinical trials, complemented by a trans-
Atlantic group of engaged patient representatives.
Methods
A bold plan will be pursued with a portfolio of projects that balance very high-risk efforts with others
nearing clinical implementation. We will focus on drivers/targets in the following diseases: Ewing
sarcoma, neuroblastoma, synovial sarcoma, ependymoma and high-grade glioma. We will explore
different approaches to target these as yet undrugged paediatric drivers/dependencies, to overcome
resistance to available targeted inhibitors, and to improve the efficacy and therapeutic window of CAR-T
treatments.
How the results will be used
The aspiration of our team is to establish a sustainable platform for repeated developmental cycles of
paediatric-specific drug development for emerging targets including a viable financial model to de-risk
such developments for such rare pediatric tumors to the direct benefit of our patients. Specifically, we
anticipate success through (i) delivering at least one optimised protein degrader for its application in
early-phase clinical trials, (ii) enabling the druggability of previously “undruggable” targets, (iii) providing
mechanistic insights into disease, novel targets, and therapy resistance mechanisms and ways to tackle
them."
11043500,"Priming of antitumor immunity relies on a specialized subset of conventional Dendritic Cells (cDC1s), CD103+
DCs, that have unique capabilities of trafficking tumor antigens to lymph nodes for cross-presentation. The critical
role of cDC1s in cancer immune surveillance make them highly coveted targets for immunotherapy; however,
their scarcity, the difficulty of specifically engaging DCs, and the suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME)
pose severe obstacles. We are investigating immunotherapy with attenuated, recombinant poliovirus (PV),
PVSRIPO, because of the naturally evolved tropism of PV for DCs. In humans or chimpanzees, oral PV infection
leads to remarkably effective targeting of CD11c+DCs in peripheral (gastrointestinal) and lymphoid tissues.
PVSRIPO, engineered with an IRES from human rhinovirus type 2, lacks cytopathogenicity in normal cells, eg.
DCs. Rather, DC infection yields ‘sustained’ type-I interferon (IFN) responses elicited by specific viral dsRNA
patterns that engage the PV pattern recognition receptor (PRR) MDA5. Mechanistic investigations of PVSRIPO
treatment in ex vivo human tumor slices revealed that: (i) the main outcome is sustained type-I IFN release from
myeloid cell subsets in the non-malignant TME; (ii) PVSRIPO’s unique innate imprint provides optimal DC
activation stimuli for CD4+T cell TH1-polarization and CD8+T cell priming; (iii) PVSRIPO’s ‘PRR-contextualized’
IFN response induces polyfunctional GzmB+, IFNg+, T-bet+ antitumor CD8+T cells that control tumor growth after
adoptive transfer. We reported very promising Ph1 clinical trial results with PVSRIPO in challenging
indications: recurrent glioblastoma and recurrent, nonresectable melanoma. Our premise is that PVSRIPO
therapy recruits cDC1s, leads to local infection of these cells, induces migration to lymph nodes/spleen,
and stimulates tumor antigen cross-presentation via the intrinsic innate inflammatory signature it elicits.
We propose mechanistic and translational studies to gain insight into targeting of DCs by PVSRIPO, the way
sublethal infection of distinct myeloid subsets activates tumor antigen cross-presentation, and rational means of
enhancing DC engagement by intranodal virus administration. We propose the following Specific Aims: (1)
Unravel mechanisms of cDC1 recruitment, activation, and lymph node migration upon PVSRIPO infection of the
TME. (2) Determine the mononuclear phagocyte compartment(s) that mediate PVSRIPO antitumor effects; test
the roles of T cell-intrinsic IFN signaling and chemotaxis. (3) Reinforce cDC1 engagement by perinodal delivery
or upon infection of the PVSRIPO-reactive glioma myeloid infiltrate.
Significance: these studies explore a unique opportunity for effectively engaging CD103+DCs in tumor antigen
cross-presentation and CD8+T cell priming, based on the natural tropism for DCs and unique innate inflammatory
imprint of PVSRIPO. The long-term objective of this research is to provide means for re-instating effective cancer
immune surveillance in patients by overcoming tumor-associated deficits in DC function and CD8+T cell priming."

Title: Optimizing Screening of Early-Onset Colorectal Cancer
Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) constitutes a significant source of morbidity and mortality,
with screening playing a pivotal role in alleviating this burden. The routine incorporation of
screening colonoscopy for individuals aged 50 or older, who are at average risk, has contributed
to a notable reduction in CRC incidence and mortality, by 35% and 37% respectively.
Nevertheless, a substantial proportion of eligible individuals do not undergo screening,
contributing to 28-44% of CRC-related deaths. In the United States, disparities are evident
among Black individuals, who are more prone to being diagnosed at younger ages and in
advanced disease stages. Timely detection of CRC can significantly enhance survival by enabling
curative colonoscopy procedures. Innovative, targeted strategies for CRC prevention hold
promise for improving overall population health and mitigating CRC disparities in the U.S.
Goal: The overarching objective is to enhance the effectiveness of cancer surveillance for
individuals at risk of early-onset colorectal cancer by tailoring the surveillance approach to each
person's estimated risk of CRC incidence and mortality. This goal aims to improve the overall
well-being of patients, optimize resource allocation, and foster greater acceptance of
surveillance among both patients and healthcare providers."

Recent nationally representative data show that 76% of adolescents experience digital dating abuse. Digital
dating abuse is the use of technology to threaten, harass, monitor, control, pressure, or coerce a romantic
partner. It is a cause for serious concern; adolescents who experience digital dating abuse are more likely to
experience mental health problems (depressive symptoms, anxiety, and suicidal ideation). Yet, the reciprocal
nature between digital dating abuse and mental health problems is unclear due to a lack of longitudinal research.
Adolescents are prolific technology users and constantly connect with romantic partners via texting and social
media. Furthermore, characteristics of media, such as the lack of non-verbal cues, publicness, and permanence
of communication, make for an easily accessible yet harmful context that possibly amplifies the adverse effects
of digital dating abuse on adolescents' mental health. Therefore, it is timely to investigate the relational and digital
mechanisms that underlie the reciprocal influences of digital interactions between romantic partners and mental
health problems. First, we will identify how adolescents with mental health problems experience increased daily
relationship threats and negative mood, leading to digital dating abuse among couples. Second, we will
investigate whether daily supportive parent and peer relationships are protective factors for the emergence of
digital dating abuse and mental health problems. At the same time, certain media characteristics (lack of non-
verbal cues, publicness, permanence) are likely to exacerbate the effects of digital dating abuse on adolescents'
mental health problems. Third, we will examine the long-term bidirectional impact of digital dating abuse and
mental health problems. Despite a higher risk for in-person dating abuse and mental health problems for Latinx
adolescents, research has yet to examine the impact of the sociocultural context on digital dating abuse.
Therefore, we will include a primary sample of Latinx adolescents and investigate how Latinx adolescents'
cultural competencies will protect against the long-term consequences of DDA on mental health problems. We
propose to follow 300 couples (N = 600 adolescents) in a dyadic, observational, and longitudinal study. In
addition to adolescents' daily self-reports, we will objectively code for digital dating abuse from screenshot
uploads of their digital relationship interactions. We will also measure negative mood and mental health problems
with passive sensing of sentiment derived from mobile phone text input. Following couples day-to-day and
longitudinally will capture the full range of digital interactions, varying from minor conflicts to digital dating abuse.
This approach will allow us to examine how, in which contexts, and when adolescents with mental health
problems engage in digital dating abuse and, in turn, investigate its long-term consequences on mental health
problems. Findings have real-world implications by identifying intervention points to break the vicious cycle
between digital dating abuse and adolescents' depressive symptoms, anxiety, and suicidal ideation."

Young black men who have sex with men (BMSM) experience a disproportionate burden of HIV
infection despite advances in HIV treatment and prevention, and their HIV risk often involves illicit
substance use. These individuals are frequently part of sexual networks with HIV transmission risk. HIV
interventions have the potential for substantial impact beyond the treated individual. This is known as
spillover (i.e., interference), and occurs when one participant's exposure affects another's health
outcome. Although spillover has been evaluated for therapies like vaccines, there is preliminary
evidence that HIV interventions result in meaningful spillover, such as treatment as prevention and pre-
exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). However, there have been limited evaluations of spillover in this
marginalized population. Important methodological work remains in the context of studies to evaluate
the spillover of HIV interventions among populations that use illicit substances. The objective of this
application is to evaluate the spillover of HIV interventions among marginalized populations
using both secondary data analyses of existing data and simulation approaches. This project will
provide new insights about spillover in the following network studies in Chicago, Illinois: uConnect,
PrEP Chicago, and Neighborhood and Networks Cohort Study. The development of sample size and
power formulas to evaluate spillover in sociometric network-based studies will facilitate post hoc
evaluations of power in the motivating studies. This will also allow investigators to conduct adequately
powered future studies of spillover to determine the most effective HIV interventions among young
BMSM. Network dependence and missing data in network-based studies are common and largely
unaddressed in the assessment of spillover. We will develop causal methods addressing both these
threats to valid inference. We will conduct a pre-deployment evaluation of spillover for HIV
interventions, including a PrEP peer change intervention and PrEP delivery focused on substance-
using agents in a calibrated agent-based network model of young BMSM in Chicago, Illinois. We have
assembled a transdisciplinary, expert team of leading methodologists, modelers, substance use
clinicians, and HIV prevention scientists, who also hold key leadership roles in the three motivating
network studies and agent-based network model. Resources at the University of Rhode Island will
provide a centrally-located environment to facilitate research, including collaborative opportunities with
leading HIV and substance use researchers. This project will advance modeling and statistical
methodology for HIV prevention among marginalized populations to assess spillover and contribute
important substantive studies of spillover in both secondary data analysis and agent-based modeling,
providing novel insights to advance HIV prevention and treatment among young BMSM."

Adolescent mental health has worsened over the last decade and increased time spent on social media is often
cited as a contributing factor. Parents, policymakers, and educators are being told to curb social media use.
However, whether restricting or changing exposure to social media use will impact mental health is largely
unknown. This research builds on our previous prospective, longitudinal, and intensive study of a population
representative sample of young adolescents. Mental health symptoms and social media use will be captured at
the daily, weekly, and yearly levels via ecological momentary assessment (EMA), passive sensing, wearable
technologies, and a new youth co-created open application program interface (API) toolkit. Social media
engagement will be captured via real time assessments alongside the extraction of social media histories via a
youth co-created API toolkit. A large representative sample of 2500 11- to 15-year-olds will be followed over four
years, with a subset of 750 adolescents followed intensively via EMA to experimentally test whether social media
restriction versus scaffolding (a) modifies social media engagement and (b) impacts mental health symptoms in
the moment, across days, and over years. Early adolescence is a key period for testing bi-directional associations
between social media use and mental health given the onset of common and costly mental disorders like anxiety
and depression, evidence of heightened response to interventions, and the fact that young people begin to
navigate online spaces independently at this time. The study is positioned to impact on science, practice, and
policy by (1) advancing discovery related to differential bi-directional influences between social media and mental
health, (2) testing whether experimental modifications to social media-engagement impact same day and future
mental health symptoms, (3) identifying subgroups of adolescents for which bi-directional linkages and/or
intervention impacts may be amplified, and (4) creating a novel resource for the field that will allow adolescents
to access, control, and share their digital trace data to advance research, interventions, and policy."
11050984,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness worldwide. Emerging evidence suggests that glia-
neuroinflammation is a critical element driving retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death and optic nerve
degeneration in the pathogenesis of glaucoma. Gene polymorphisms in toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4,
inflammatory receptor) and ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1, cellular cholesterol
transporter) are linked to the risk of primary open-angle glaucoma. Our studies demonstrated increased
TLR4 and reduced ABCA1 expression in RGCs and glia in the human glaucomatous retina. We identified
the secreted apoA-I binding protein (AIBP) as a key regulator of cellular cholesterol metabolism, which
controls TLR4 activation via ABCA1-dependent cholesterol depletion from TLR4-occupied lipid rafts in
inflammatory and activated cells. Similar to ABCA1, AIBP expression was reduced, while cholesterol
levels and inflammatory markers increased in human and mouse glaucomatous retinas. Apoa1bp-/- mice
had compromised visual acuity and compared to the wild type, had increased retinal TLR4 and IL-1β
expression, augmented microglial activation, and increased RGC death in response to elevated
intraocular pressure (IOP). These findings support the rationale for the restoration of AIBP expression in
the retina to provide sustained neuroprotection in patients with glaucoma. In preliminary studies, adeno-
associated virus (AAV)-AIBP protected RGCs and ameliorated visual dysfunction in experimental mouse
models of glaucoma. In addition, recombinant AIBP protein promoted mitochondrial function as well as
inhibited inflammatory responses in cultured Müller glia and microglia in response to elevated hydrostatic
pressure. Based on our findings we proposed the development of AAV2-hAIBP-based therapy to reduce
retinal neuroinflammation and provide effective neuroprotection to glaucoma patients receiving standard-
of-care IOP-lowering treatment. This work is currently funded by the 1UG3NS129684-01A1 grant award.
The overall goal of the UG3/UH3 project is to conduct preclinical studies of an AAV-AIBP for the treatment
of glaucoma. The current lead construct encodes a secreted form of AIBP-His in which the C-terminal
6xHis augments the biological activity of AIBP. The goal of this supplemental proposal is to assess the
relative risk of immunogenicity between the two test samples, an AIBP-His recombinant protein, and
tagless AIBP, and in comparison, them with the clinically relevant controls with known immunogenicity.
These results will provide necessary data for an assessment of the risk of clinical immunogenicity for
AIBP-His and the selection of the final candidate for the development of the AAV-AIBP construct for
neuroprotection in glaucoma. It would also provide the flexibility needed to undertake the high-impact
1UG3NS129684-01A1 project and its on-schedule progression to the UH3 phase."

Difficulties with social communication are among the core impairments of autism spectrum disorders (ASD)
and pose significant challenges for the one in 44 American children diagnosed with ASD. Early disruptions in
social interaction, especially the establishment of episodes of joint attention between children and their
parents, are believed to be at the root of the language impairment that is often comorbid with ASD.
Deaf parents have significant advantages over hearing parents in their ability to obtain, maintain, and direct the
visual attention of their children. Yet the behavior of Deaf parents of children with ASD – hearing or deaf – has
never before been studied.
This project aims to compare the attention-regulating strategies of Deaf and hearing caregivers of children with
ASD. First, we aim to study dyadic interaction between Deaf and hearing caregivers and their children with
ASD in order to determine if Deaf caregivers differ from hearing caregivers in the modalities and strategies
employed to obtain and maintain their children’s visual attention. Second, we seek to determine if specific
attention-regulating strategies result in more and longer episodes of joint attention, setting the stage for a more
favorable environment for language development.
Overall, the project aims to leverage the benefits of Deaf adaptiveness in the visual modality over the social-
cognitive challenges of ASD. The results will advance our understanding of the impact that parent behavior has
on language and cognitive development, and will inform the development of training interventions for parents of
children with ASD."

Tracheomalacia is the most common structural abnormality in the lower airway. The estimated incidence in
children ranges from 1 in 1,500 to 1 in 2,500. Tracheomalacia is very often associated with congenital
syndromic disorders and congenital tracheomalacia associated with impaired cartilage integrity often
represents the ones with severe symptoms, less regression percentage and higher mortality rate. Currently,
surgical intervention is the only option, which requires disproportionately high allocation of health care
resources. The lack of knowledge on the tracheal cartilage development and the pathophysiological
mechanisms lead to impaired tracheal cartilage integrity prevent searching for alternative interventions for
congenital tracheomalacia. BMP signaling has been demonstrated as a critical growth factor necessary for
chondrogenesis and cartilage development, however, how BMP signaling is regulated during tracheal cartilage
development has not been investigated. EvC syndrome (OMIM 225500) is an autosomal recessive
chondrodysplasia. Neonatal death subsequent to airway collapse has been documented in patients with EvC
syndrome. Our preliminary studies using Evc2 mutant mice uncover the potential novel mechanisms on the
regulated BMP signaling both in foregut mesenchyme and in tracheal mesenchyme. We have demonstrated
that well-orchestrated BMP signaling in foregut and tracheal mesenchyme is necessary for tracheal cartilage
developing into correct shape. Our preliminary studies lead us hypothesize that: Hedgehog-BMP axis at
foregut mesenchyme determines the BMP signaling levels in tracheal mesenchyme and the subsequent
chondrogenesis; after trachea and esophagus separation, extracellularly stored BMP ligands play a critical role
in inducing BMP signaling in tracheal mesenchyme for subsequent chondrogenesis; and that administration of
FK506 has the potential to correct the congenital defective tracheal cartilage in Evc2 mutant mice. During 2
years of the funding period of the parent grant, we have made substantial progresses on the Aim 1 and Aim 3.
We are currently putting more efforts towards Aim 2 experiments, which require intensive mouse breeding and
subsequent tissue isolation and molecular assessments. Addition of Mr. Sher Khehra will further accelerate our
team efforts to propel our progress and enhance the diversity of our interdisciplinary team, while providing his
meaningful career development opportunity."

Our vision is to unravel and ultimately reverse the intricate network of causal factors throughout the life course
that disrupts biological homeostasis to promote colorectal cancer (CRC) among individuals younger than age
50 years. Uniting leading scientific minds in early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC) research and
complementary fields, we have embraced disruptive, transdisciplinary approaches spanning cells to individuals
to populations to address the core Grand Challenge to “Determine why the incidence of early-onset cancers is
rising globally”. We will address specific questions of “the mechanisms linking lifetime exposures with cancer
initiation and promotion” by focusing on EOCRC as an ideal model for early-onset cancer due to the availability
of well-characterized animal models and well-established and prevalent precursor lesion, the adenomatous
polyp (adenoma), offering a unique opportunity for interception and prevention. Our work will transform the field
by directly addressing our overarching goal to “identify and understand the processes through which different
biological and environmental factors cause early-onset cancers”, and reverse the burden in a timely, effective,
feasible, inclusive fashion. Our team, both working independently and in collaboration, has uncovered several
risk factors that are likely to be drivers for the rising incidence for EOCRC. We are now uniquely positioned to
translate etiologic understanding to actionable prevention by identifying novel factors, including environmental
and social determinants, and deepening our understanding into overlooked dimensions of exposure throughout
the life course. The unprecedented scope and scale of our proposal can only be supported through Cancer
Grand Challenges since our “high-risk” disruptive approach requires deep interactions between work packages
(WP)s led by leaders in diverse disciplines. This will enable incorporation of fresh perspectives to move beyond
traditional risk-factor epidemiology toward an integrated, mechanistically-informed model with population scale
and cellular resolution of the multiple and cumulative “hits” that promote EOCRC to inform the development of
actionable prevention. Our innovations intersect epidemiology, small molecule discovery, genomics, stem cell
biology, immunology, and computational biology with these key features: 1) harmonization of diverse cohorts
with data and biospecimens collected across the lifecourse; 2) innovative and reliable analysis of small
molecules to detect novel exposures; 3) high-resolution technologies for analysis of target tissues; 4) model
systems capable of interrogating accumulating exposures across the lifespan and their impact on the cellular
ecosystem; 5) prevention through risk assessment and pharmacologic/lifestyle interventions. Collectively, our

Only 13% of the 780,000 adults living with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have normal cognitive function. We
found that 14.0% of ESRD patients aged 35-49 experience severe cognitive impairment and 2.9% have a co-
occurring functional dependence suggestive of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (AD/ADRD). After
dialysis initiation older (≥65) patients experience a 21-25% lifetime risk of AD/ADRD. Younger ESRD patients
experience premature cognitive aging requiring the study of cognition and AD/ADRD across the lifespan. Black
ESRD patients are more than twice as likely to develop cognitive impairment and 70%-78% more likely to be
diagnosed with AD/ADRD; this disparity is comparable to a 10 year increase in age. While systemic racism is a
known contributor to health disparities in community-dwelling older adults, its impact on cognitive aging among
ESRD patients is understudied. Measurement of systemic racism (i.e., structural, institutional, and
interpersonal) is crucial to identifying ESRD patients who are at risk of premature cognitive aging and those
who are resilient in the face of racism. Elucidating mechanisms by which systemic racism impacts cognitive
aging will lead to interventions and policies that may prevent the devastation of AD/ADRD for 234,000 Black
ESRD patients. We seek to address a National Institute on Aging (NIA) goal (RFA-MD-21-004): “To elucidate
whether and how mechanisms connecting structural racism to aging-relevant outcomes, including cognition
and AD/ADRD, operate on multiple levels.” ESRD patients are the ideal population to elucidate these
mechanisms: 1) 30% of patients are Black; 2) 87% experience premature cognitive aging; 3) all enroll in a
national registry and 65% in Medicare for measurement of institutional racism. For all adult ESRD patients in
the national registry/Medicare database, we will glean 23 indicators of structural racism from publicly available
data and identify 3 indicators of institutional racism. Then, we will link these data to our ongoing, NIA-funded,
multi-center, prospective cohort study (FAIR, n=5,275) of aging and ESRD to fully characterize systemic
racism (lifecourse structural racism, institutional racism, and interpersonal racism). This is the oldest (>12
years) ESRD cohort study that includes longitudinal measures global and domain specific cognitive function.
The National Kidney Foundation, Alzheimer’s Association, and a local community advisory board will guide the
design and interpretation of the following aims: 1) To estimate the impact of structural and institutional racism
on incident AD/ADRD; 2) To quantify the contributions of lifecourse systemic racism on cognitive impairment
and decline; and 3) To test whether resilience to systemic racism protects against cognitive impairment and
decline. By taking a lifecourse approach and engaging community, family, and patient stakeholders in all
phases of our study, we will identify feasible targets for improving resilience in the face of systemic racism.
These potential targets for interventions and policies to counter structural racism will likely generalize to other
populations with chronic diseases."

Prostate, breast and pancreatic cancers all have a disproportionately higher rate of aggressive
tumor grade and early onset in Black patients, with recent spikes of high incidence in west African
nations compared to other African regions. The genetic background correlations implicate
predispositions. Members of our SAMBAI team of investigators have pioneered genomics in
cancer disparities research and over the past two decades we have uncovered compelling
evidence of distinct immunological mechanisms associated with genetic ancestry. Our SAMBAI
team members have developed methods to quantify environmental exposures and interrogate
lived experiences of marginalized populations including epigenetic responses racism. Aims We
will partner with scientists across the US, Africa and the UK to build an unprecedented resource,
the SAMBAI Biobank and Data Repository for Cancer Equity Research. We will generate a
comprehensive, accurate and relevant measurement of social, environmental, genetic and
immunological factors to complete an integrated set of analyses to define the causal vs. modifier
relationships of disparate outcomes in diverse underserved populations. We will establish a
sustainable framework for team science approaches with under- represented partners and
establish best practices for coordinating cancer equity research on a global scale. Methods We
propose to utilize multiple methods across our different work packages. Social Determinants
includes self- reporting surveys and database abstractions. Exposomes utilize mass spectrometry
of plasma. Genomics will utilize three sequencing methods on germline and tumor tissue,
including long-read, short/deep and ultra-low pass whole genome sequencing. Lastly,
immunological profiles will be measured with spatial transcriptomics and circulating multiplex
immunoassays. These data require novel computational frameworks, including cloud- based
virtualization and use of machine learning technologies to identify novel associations across the
strata of social to spatial data elements and across our diverse geographic and ancestral SAMBAI
cohorts. Utility and Impact We will improve research capacity in under-resourced environments
for large scale cancer research and equitable access to data with equitable feasibility to improve
treatment and outcomes. We will define interactions of environmental exposures, social
determinants, and genetic ancestry that determine immunological landscapes of primary tumors
and/or circulating immunological profiles in patients of African descent. Our project will contribute
a data repository with 100K features/patient, for 40,000 patients. The impact to this population
includes a novel trial design, in collaboration with our patient advocacy partners, to ensure that
the specific genomic and immunological features we uncover become part of targeted precision

11044428,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Assisted living (AL) is a growing long-term care industry providing housing and supportive services to
800,000+ frail and functionally impaired older adults - over 40% of whom are living with Alzheimer's disease or
a related dementia (ADRD). Demographic projections of increased demand for AL, and especially dementia
care (also referred to as “memory care”), has attracted notice from private equity (PE) firms. PE ownership
advocates argue that PE firms bring much needed capital, allowing providers to update facilities, invest in new
technology, and gain economies of scale to enhance efficiency, increase profitability, and improve care quality.
However, the growing concern is that some PE firms' focus on short-term profits may compromise the quality
of care of AL residents, particularly those living with dementia. Research findings on the effects of PE
acquisitions of nursing homes are mixed: while some studies found negative effects (e.g., decreased staffing,
increased mortality) others have found no change in staffing or quality outcomes. However, unlike nursing
homes, AL is most often paid for privately; and, there is no national framework of regulations, payment policies,
or public reporting of care quality to work as “guardrails” against the possible negative impacts of PE
acquisitions as there are in nursing homes. Therefore, the objective of this application is to understand the
types of AL that PE firms invest in and how PE acquisitions impact the composition of residents with ADRD
and residents' outcomes. Our working hypotheses are: 1) ALs that are part of a large chain, located in markets
with more demand, and operating under licenses with less regulatory stringency are more likely to be
purchased by PE firms; and 2) acquired ALs respond to changes in ownership by restructuring operations in
ways that influence the composition of residents and ultimately residents' outcomes. These hypotheses will be
tested in an exploratory/explanatory sequential mixed methods study with three specific aims: 1) Explore
stakeholders' perceptions of PE firms' motives and the impact of PE investment on AL communities; 2)
Compare ALs that were acquired or divested by PE firms between 2010 and 2019 to those that were not; 3)
Estimate the causal effect of PE acquisitions on the prevalence of residents with ADRD in AL and residents'
outcomes over a 10-year period. Under the first aim, the research team will leverage their existing networks
and interview stakeholders to elicit different perspectives on the motives and impacts of PE acquisitions. Under
the second aim, the team will apply the methods they developed and data they previously collected to
understand which ALs are PE targets. The third aim will examine the welfare effects of PE acquisition on
residents with and without ADRD applying an instrumental variable method. The results from this study will be
the first to investigate PE acquisitions of AL. As policymakers are urged to consider ownership reporting and
monitoring in other sectors, it is important to have insight into the less regulated AL industry that provides
supportive services to vulnerable older and disabled adults, almost half of whom are living with dementia."

Despite years of antiretroviral therapy, viral reservoirs persist in individuals living with HIV-1, resulting in viral
rebound if treatment is interrupted. Difficulties of sustained life ‐long treatment in the millions of people living
with HIV worldwide, with a significant burden in sub-Saharan Africa, necessitates research that moves us
closer to a sterilizing or functional cure for HIV. Sub-Saharan Africa shoulders a disproportionate burden of
the HIV epidemic globally, making it an important region in which to conduct HIV cure research. Yet most
potential therapeutic strategies are not being designed or tested with most people living with HIV in mind .
There is an urgent need to bring novel insights and approaches rooted in Africa into HIV cure research to
address African HIV subtypes, the unique biologic characteristics of African female and male populations, and
other pressing, but neglected, research areas. The goal of this proposal is to expand the capacity of the
AFRICURE program to recruit, mentor, and support early- and mid-career African investigators to address
Africa-specific biologic, therapeutic, and implementation issues in HIV cure research. The AFRICURE program
will be integrated into the JHU CFAR Development Core and coordinated through the Inter-CFAR Sub-
Saharan Africa Working Group. The program will award one-year, mentored developmental awards to
promising early- and mid-career African investigators to conduct HIV cure research projects. The specific aims
are to: 1) identify and recruit early- and mid-career African investigators to conduct innovative HIV cure
research in Africa; 2) provide mentorship and career development for African HIV cure investigators ; and 3)
evaluate the impact of the AFRICURE program. We will identify and recruit exceptional early- and mid-career
African investigators, with a focus on individuals representing diverse backgrounds, experiences, and
geographical locations within the region. The program will foster mentorship collaborations between the
selected African investigators and established HIV cure researchers across CFARs in the United States and
research institutions in Africa, facilitating knowledge exchange and skill development. We will evaluate the
impact of the program on the careers of early- and mid-career African investigators, institutional capacities and
infrastructure to conduct HIV cure research, and contributions to scientific advancement and the integration of
African perspectives in HIV cure research strategies. The AFRICURE program addresses the critical need for
inclusivity and diversity in HIV cure research by fostering a new generation of African investigators. Through
collaborative efforts, this program aims to contribute to advancing HIV cure strategies that are contextu ally
relevant to the diverse populations most affected by the epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa."

Approximately 34.1 million (13%) adults in the US have type 2 diabetes (T2D). The prevalence of T2D is 17%
higher in rural dwellers compared to their urban counterparts, and the prevalence of T2D increases with age,
with an estimated 25% of older adults (≥ 65 years) diagnosed. Appropriate self-care is necessary for optimal
clinical outcomes, and variability in self-care accounts for 90% of the variance in glycemic control. Overall, T2D
self-care is consistently poor among the general population but is even worse in rural-dwellers and older adults.
This is particularly true in rural Kentucky, where up to 23% of adults in Appalachian communities have been
diagnosed with T2D and, of those, 26.8% are older adults. To attain optimal clinical outcomes, social
environmental factors, including social support, are integral when promoting T2D self-care. Specifically, peer
support has shown to be efficacious in improving T2D self-care behaviors; it provides emotional support,
instrumental support, and education while also helping individuals develop new skills. Similarly, peer support has
also been shown to improve clinical and psychosocial outcomes related to T2D; however, there is literature that
also suggests self-selected social support can be obstructive when trying to engage in healthful activities.
Currently available evidence-based interventions (EBIs) using peer support have not been used specifically to
prioritize older adults, especially those living in rural communities. To address this gap in research, we have
conducted formative research with regional practitioners, leaders of service organizations in Appalachia, and
residents, and through that process, we collaboratively identified an acceptable and feasible peer support EBI—
peer health coaching (PHC)—that has resulted in improved clinical and psychosocial T2D-related outcomes
among participants who did not reside in rural communities nor were ≥65 years. Through these community
conversations, we also determined necessary a priori adaptations to the EBI to ensure its cultural and contextual
relevance to regional needs and values. Because PHC is a community-based and low-cost intervention, it holds
promise to be a sustainable and scalable model across Appalachian Kentucky where resources are often scant,
but community bonds are valued. Informed by literature and feedback from stakeholders, the goal of the
proposed study is to use a 2x2 factorial design to test the adapted PHC components and determine their
preliminary effectiveness to promote self-care behaviors and improve glycemic control among older adults living
in Appalachian Kentucky. The main components of the factorial design will be how peer coaches are selected
for participants (self-selected vs matched) and frequency of contact with coach (once per week vs every 2
weeks). To achieve this goal, we will (1) determine which EBI components are associated with improved T2D-
related outcomes in older adults living in Appalachia Kentucky and (2) evaluate the pragmatic implementability
of the adapted EBI."

Robust and tightly regulated DNA repair is critical to maintain genome stability and prevent disease development.
Eukaryotic DNA is packaged into chromatin that has a profound, yet not well understood regulatory influence on
DNA repair, replication and genome maintenance. There is a fundamental gap in understanding how DNA repair
pathways are regulated and coordinated within structurally diverse chromatin, and across the heterogeneous
genomic landscape. The HELLS (Helicase Lymphoid Specific) is a poorly understood chromatin-associated
protein, with an emerging new role in genome maintenance. Mouse HELLS is essential for gametogenesis and
proper development of the immune system. Mutations in human HELLS cause severe immunodeficiency
syndrome ICF (Immunodeficiency Centromeric Instability Facial anomalies). Despite substantial progress in
understanding the molecular functions of the mammalian HELLS in DNA methylation and chromatin remodeling,
its role in DNA repair and genome maintenance is poorly understood and remains elusive. The unresolved
questions remain whether HELLS regulates multiple DNA repair pathways, and whether it has specialized roles
in the repair and maintenance of a distinct genomic loci or domains. We have established and validated fungal
model, Neurospora crassa to advance the fundamental understanding of HELLS-mediated mechanisms of
genome stability. Our studies reveal a new, previously unrecognized link between HELLS proteins and cellular
responses to DNA alkylation damage in fungal and human cells. We hypothesize that HELLS protects cells form
alkylation-induced toxicity and plays important roles in the repair and stability of the constitutive heterochromatin
domains. This hypothesis is founded based on a strong preliminary data in the fungal model Neurospora and in
human cells demonstrating that cells deficient in HELLS exhibit sensitivity to DNA alkylation damage and are
deficient in the repair of the constitutive heterochromatin. In addition, we discovered that loss of fungal WDR76
protein in HELLS mutant cells leads to the synthetic rescue of the alkylation sensitivity phenotype, implying that
WDR76 acts as genetic suppressor of HELLS deficiency. In Aim 1 we will determine the role of fungal and human
HELLS remodelers in the repair of alkylation DNA damage. In Aim 2 we will define precise genomic and
chromatin contexts that depend on HELLS for genome maintenance. In Aim 3 we will determine the functional
relationship between HELLS and WDR76, a WD40 protein implicated in response to DNA alkylation. Successful
completion of the proposed research will define HELLS-mediated mechanisms of genome maintenance, and
identify additional regulators and pathways cooperating with HELLS in protecting the cells from detrimental
consequences of genotoxic stress. These studies will provide important insights into the origin of the disease-
causing chromosomal rearrangements and breaks found in many human diseases, including the ICF syndrome."

Globally, more than half of the world's 37 million people living with HIV are on antiretroviral therapy (ART)
representing immense and encouraging success with access to HIV care. ART prevents disease, death and HIV
transmission and HIV-positive persons can expect to live as long as their HIV-negative peers when their viral
load is undetectable. However, treatment success still lags behind goals. In South Africa alone, 8 million HIV-
positive persons require ART for life and only 4.5 million are currently on ART. Patient barriers to care, such as
missed wages, transport costs, and long wait times for clinic visits and ART refills, are associated with detectable
viral load, the hallmark of struggling to access and take ART. HIV differentiated service delivery (DSD) has
simplified ART delivery: incentives, multi-month scripts, fast-track ART, and community or home ART delivery
motivate clients, reduce the frequency of clinic visits, and decongest clinics. DSD is standard for clients who
achieve viral suppression and engage in care; however, DSD needs adaptation to serve clients who are not
succeeding. Indeed, persons who are not engaged in care arguably need simplified, client-centered
approaches even more than those who can successfully engage.
A suite of adaptive DSD strategies, including community-based ART, have been tested among stable clients
with viral suppression. Lottery incentives effectively change short-term behavior, increasing ART initiation.
Community and home ART delivery increases ART coverage and simplify ART access overcoming clinic
barriers. For stable clients, these DSD activities are as effective as clinic-based care in terms of achieving and
maintaining viral suppression, although among stable clients they have not shown superiority in viral suppression
or cost savings. In contrast, DSD has the potential to improve rates of viral suppression and retention in care
and save costs among more hard-to-reach groups. There is great potential that DSD systems can be client-
responsive and system-efficient for subgroups requiring additional services, matching services with client needs.
A sequential, comprehensive package of DSD approaches, with each step increasing the intensity of service
provision – adaptive DSD – has not been tested to determine the proportion and characteristics of persons who
would achieve viral suppression and retention in care and to estimate the cost-effectiveness and budget impact.
To increase population level viral suppression, persons with detectable viral load need responsive DSD
interventions. A Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) design facilitates evaluation of a
stepped, adaptive approach to achieving viral suppression with `right-sized' interventions. We are an experienced
team and propose to build on our strong partnerships to sequentially test adaptive DSD strategies for persons
with detectable viral load: lottery incentives, community-based ART, and home ART delivery. Our aim is to
identify the most effective and efficient HIV care delivery strategies for South Africa."

 Mammalian taste buds are a cluster of specialized epithelial cells residing primarily in the epithelium of the
lingual taste papilla which covers a core of connective tissue. Like other epithelial cells, taste bud cells have a
short lifespan and undergo continuous renewal. Therefore, the homeostasis of taste buds and taste sensation
requires constant taste bud cell differentiation from progenitors. Thorough information of the regulation in taste
cell differentiation from progenitors is essential to understanding taste disorders and finding effective therapeutic
treatments. Prior studies on the molecular regulation in taste cell differentiation have focused on the signals
within epithelium. Little is known regarding the roles of the underlying connective tissue.
 Recently, for the first time in the field, our findings demonstrated the requirement of signals from neural crest-
derived tongue mesenchyme in taste papilla differentiation during embryonic development. This leads us to ask
whether the underlying connective tissue regulates the cell renewal of mature taste buds in adult animals. Our
preliminary data revealed that delivery of extracted proteins from the genetically modified embryonic tongue
mesenchyme into adult mouse tongue resulted in an alteration of taste buds in the injection-surrounding tongue
region. Moreover, selected signaling proteins (i.e., Noggin and Pleiotrophin) secreted by embryonic tongue
mesenchyme were also detected in the neural crest-derived connective tissue cells from adult mouse tongue,
suggesting a mesenchymal regulation in the homeostasis of taste buds in adult mice.
 We hypothesize that in adult animals the neural crest derived connective tissue cells in the core of taste
papillae send signals to the overlying epithelium and regulates cell renewal of mature taste buds. In this proposal,
we will use both in vivo and ex vivo systems to examine the effects of cell products from connective tissue cells
on taste cell differentiation. Neural crest-derived connective tissue cells in fungiform and circumvallate papilla
region will be sorted from adult Sox10-Cre/tdTomato (tdT) mice. The tdT+ (neural crest-derived) cells will be
cultured for isolation of protein fractions (>100 kDa, 10-100 kDa, <10 kDa) from conditioned medium. The effects
of cell products on taste cell differentiation will be tested in adult Krt5-CreER/nTnG and Shh-CreER/nTnG mice
in which taste bud progenitors (Krt5+) and precursors [sonic hedgehog (Shh)+], and derived taste cells are traced.
 In Aim 1, we will test in vivo whether homeostasis of mature fungiform taste buds is regulated by the products
of neural crest-derived connective tissue cells using hydrogel to deliver the fractions of connective tissue cell
products and two individual proteins (Noggin and Pleiotrophin) into the subepithelial space of tongue tip. In Aim
2, we will test whether circumvallate taste cell differentiation is regulated by the underlying connective tissue
cells ex vivo using a 3-D organoid culture system. Thorough analysis of taste bud progenitors and their derived
taste cells will generate data to fill the significant knowledge gaps of whether the underlying connective tissue

RASopathies encompass a spectrum of genetic disorders caused by germline gain-of-function variants in genes
encoding critical components of the RAS/MAPK pathway, leading to dysregulation and hyperactivation of the
pathway in cells. The RASopathies, including Noonan, Cardio-facio-cutaneous, and Costello syndrome, are
characterized by overlapping clinical features, such as delayed growth, cardiovascular abnormalities,
developmental challenges, tumor predisposition and many others. Although individually rare, when combined,
RASopathies represent one of the most common congenital disorder. Despite their high prevalence and pathway
identification, therapeutic options remain limited, and novel treatment strategies are urgently needed. Emerging
preclinical and clinical evidence suggest that RASopathies often lead to metabolic and bioenergetic
abnormalities. In addition, our preliminary research supports the critical role of mitochondrial disfunction and
metabolite alteration in the pathophysiology of a RASopathy preclinical model. Therefore, this project aims to
elucidate the role of mitochondrial function in RASopathies. Specifically, in Aim1 we will analyze mitochondrial
morphology and function, including enzymatic activities and oxygen consumption, in tissues from a RASopathy
mouse model that highly recapitulates the clinical features of these syndromes. In Aim 2 we will focus on
identifying the signaling pathways and/or metabolites that contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction in the
RASopathies. By leveraging advanced techniques and models, our research aims to gain further insights into
the understanding of RASopathy pathogenesis. Ultimately, findings from this study hold promise for informing
the development of targeted therapies to address the metabolic phenotype associated with RASopathies, thus
improving outcomes for affected individuals."

PROGRAM PROJECT SUMMARY 
The Cancer Immunology and Immunotherapy (CII) Program is a longstanding basic and translational sciences 
program within the Mayo Clinic Cancer Center (MCCC). In 2016, this program was officially endowed by the 
David F. and Margaret T. Grohne Family. The Program continues to work toward better understanding the 
mechanisms of immunity, the relationship between inflammation and cancer, and the development of 
innovative solutions to combat cancer through immune therapy. The CII Program has contributed significantly 
to checkpoint blockade therapy, which has resulted in a major change in the standard of care of several 
different cancers. It is now poised to make additional major contributions such as using antibody-targeted 
chemotherapeutics, effectively targeting melanoma and ovarian cancers, which have proven nonresponsive to 
established therapies. The Program includes 35 members, representing 14 different departments in the Mayo 
Clinic College of Medicine and Science. The current membership is a historically highly productive team with a 
total publication record in excess of 5000 papers that has garnered over 245,000 citations. The main goal of 
the Program is to provide an interactive, supportive, and durable scientific environment to foster our four 
principal cutting-edge Specific Aims: (1) To develop new knowledge about how the immune system functions, 
(2) To develop novel antibody-based therapies for the treatment of cancers (3) To identify and develop vaccine 
approaches that can be implemented to protect against cancer recurrence and improve the efficacy of immune 
modulation with checkpoint inhibitors, and (4) To develop innovative strategies to redirect non-tumor antigen- 
specific T cells to attack cancer. The CII Program has been consistently well-funded and currently is supported 
by extramural peer-reviewed grants totaling $3.6M in direct costs of which ~35% are from NCI. Direct funding 
from non-peer-reviewed grants is $8.4M resulting in an overall total of $12M. This is a 20% increase over the 
last funding period. In the 2013-2017 timeframe, Program members published 650 cancer-related publications, 
of which 19% were intraprogrammatic, 57% were interprogrammatic, and 124 were published in journals with 
impact factors ≥10, reflecting the quality of the work and illustrating the high degree of interaction the CII 
Program members have with members of other MCCC Programs."

Speech deficits are among the most prevalent and impairing of symptoms for people with Autism Spectrum
Disorder (ASD). In fact, 25% of people with ASD have little to no speech. The reasons many people with ASD
struggle to speak are still poorly understood, which means that our treatments don’t target the source of the
problem. Our preliminary work has demonstrated that altering auditory feedback can influence speech in
individuals with ASD. However, the ability to translate these findings to the development of novel treatments for
speech deficits in ASD is impeded by our limited understanding of how auditory feedback interacts with speech
motor control in individuals with ASD. In the proposed study, we will use behavioral tasks and multiple methods
of advanced brain imaging to understand how brain chemicals and brain function impact a child’s ability to speak
in order to identify the specific barriers to speech production for people with ASD.
Specifically, we will first characterize psychophysical and neural markers of speech motor control in children and
adolescents with and without ASD (Aim 1). We will then identify the mechanisms of speech motor control that
are associated with clinical symptoms of speech impairment (Aim 2). Using magnetoencephalography, functional
MRI and MR spectroscopy, we will then examine the relations between clinical speech abilities and brain
metabolites and connectivity in the speech motor network (Aim 3). The results of the project will not only help
explain why some people with ASD struggle to speak but will also open doors for development of targeted
treatments to address the source of the problem for the first time, which could dramatically extend the impact of
current speech therapies and even fundamentally change the prognosis for minimally verbal children with autism."
11042527,"Human tissues are highly organized structures with specific collagen matrix arrangements and the
resulting mechanical properties varying from point to point. The effects of such heterogeneity play an
important role for tissue function and failure. However, fundamental challenges present in understanding
how heterogeneity affects the growth and remodeling of various tissues and the related mechanical
performance of these tissues, due to limited knowledge on understanding of the multi-scale interactions
between cell signaling and heterogeneous matrix remodeling and their roles in tissue function.
The central theme of this proposal is to develop a novel bio-mathematical framework that dynamically
integrates physics-based and d ata-driven modeling approaches with experimental measurements, to
capture cell-matrix interactions in tissue multi-scale behavior and function. We aim to improve the
fundamental understanding of the underlying biological and mechanical implications o f matrix
heterogeneity, and advance towards our ultimate goal of providing a digital twin model for in-vivo tissue
degeneration on aneurysm growth. The team, formed by three Pl/Co-ls with complementary expertise on
scientific machine learning, experimental tissue biomechanics, and biological tissue modeling, plans to
ad vance on theoretical, computational, and experimental as pects towards the knowledge of
fi broblast-medi ated extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling via three specific aims: (i) A multi-scale
data-driven model will be developed to concu rrently couple our intra-cellular signaling network model, a
novel agent-based cell population model, and a peridynamics model of tissue mechanics; (ii)
E
nriched by
advanced multi-task/multi-modal operator learning techniques, an information-theory based model
adaptation-experimental design integration pipeline will be developed; and (iii) New quantitative
knowledge on long-term fibroblast-mediated ECM remodeling will be obtained and validated through both
in-vitro and ex-vivo experiments. As a result, our combined in-vitro/ex-vivo experiments and multi-scale
model will help identify for the first time how heterogeneity affects tissue remodeling and the related
mechanical behaviors of tissue. The identified key features and optimized model forms enable the
learning from small data regime, providing a step-stone towards the digital twin modeling f or in-vivo
aneurysm growth. The proposed model will have significant impacts on transforming our understanding of
the roles of cell functi ons for determining tissue structures/mechanics, and thereby enabling model-based
virtual screening to identify and optimize therapeutic interventions. Our multi-scale model will of fer a
powerful prediction tool to the multi-scale biological mechanisms in many other bio-tissue systems, such
as blast-induced traumatic brain injury, aging of cartilage tissue, and bone reconstruction."
11049233,"ABSTRACT
 The body maintains an adequate balance between citrate availability and elimination, depending on
physiological needs and determined by diet, renal clearance, cell metabolism and bone remodeling. Citrate is
used by all aerobic organisms to produce usable chemical energy and is present in bone at strikingly high
concentrations (1-5 wt%). In fact, two independent studies using high resolution NMR to model the citrate
molecule within the apatite crystal suggest that the degree of citrate incorporation, as well as its spatial orientation
within the mineral structure, is critical for maintaining favorable biomechanical properties. These observations
prompt several fundamental questions that form the basis for this proposal: 1) What is the mechanism for citrate
delivery to bone?; 2) How does the partitioning of citrate in bone influence global citrate handling?; and 3) how
is this partitioning regulated?
 In preliminary studies, we demonstrate functional expression of a membranous extracellular Na+/citrate
cotransporter, Solute Carrier Family 13 Member 5 (Slc13a5), in mineralizing osteoblasts. Interference of
SLC13A5-mediated citrate transport, either genetically or pharmacologically, disrupts osteoblast mediated
mineral nucleation. Mice lacking Slc13a5 show increased serum and urinary citrate levels, reduced bone volume
and quality, and defects in tooth enamel, pathological features similar to those seen in humans with mutations
in SLC13A5. Intriguingly, metabolic flux analysis revealed striking elevations in 13C-Glucose-derived 13C-Citrate
(m+2) in apatite deposited by Slc13a5 null osteoblasts which was allocated to increased mitochondrial citrate
production and export. Moreover, we found that Slc13a5 expression was strongly regulated by the calciotropic
parathyroid hormone (PTH). These findings suggest the existence of an osteoblast specific mechanism that
controls both the production and delivery of citrate to bone as well as systemic citrate availability. Specifically,
we postulate that the membrane citrate transporter SLC13A5 senses extracellular citrate concentrations
and enables the osteoblast to adjust its endogenous citrate production when extracellular citrate levels
drop or in response to calcium regulating hormones such as PTH.
 Three aims were developed to assess our new metabolic pathway downstream of SLC13A5 in a human
disease model using hiPSCs and primary teeth derived from patients with SLC13A5 disease and to define the
role of SLC13A5 in citrate partitioning between blood and bone in physiological conditions or in response to PTH.
As a young scientist, my ultimate goal is to conduct productive research that provides scientific insights into
skeletal mineralization and the integration of these mechanisms in general physiology. My career development
plan has been tailored toward this goal with solid mentorship, collaborations, and training opportunities. In
conjunction with institutional support, I am confident that the studies/activities outlined in my application will help
build upon my existing skillset and facilitate my transition into an independent investigator."
11049287,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of this grant is to understand how bystander infections with intestinal parasites alter chronic
infection with γ-herpesviruses. This is important because herpesviruses infect virtually all people and
approximately a quarter of the world’s population is simultaneously infected with a parasite. Herpesvirus
infections are chronic, but these viruses do not persistently replicate in a healthy host. Instead, they
establish a quiescent infection, termed latency. We discovered previously that co-infection with an
intestinal helminth parasite after infection with γ-herpesvirus led to increased virus reactivation from
latency. We detailed a mechanism whereby reactivation of the virus depended on sensing host cytokines
produced in response to the parasite. A remaining question is whether the timing of the dual infections is
important. In this grant we propose to address this question by changing the order of virus-parasite co-
infection to determine whether reactivation of the virus is increased by parasite infection when the
parasite infection occurs before the γ-herpesvirus infection. We have data to indicate that prior infection
with an intestinal parasite increases γ-herpesvirus reactivation, but that the mechanism is different than
what we discovered previously when parasite infection occurs after the herpesvirus infection. We find
that parasite infected animals have increased resident peritoneal macrophages. We also find that when
retinoic acid, which is required for maintenance of resident peritoneal macrophages, is depleted in mice,
parasite infection no longer increases virus reactivation. Our hypothesis is that parasite infection, in a
retinoic acid dependent manner, alters the tissue composition of resident macrophages. This promotes
retention of a population of infected macrophages with enhanced γ-herpesvirus reactivation. In this
proposal, we aim to examine the role of resident macrophages and retinoic acid in parasite-induced
herpesvirus reactivation. These studies will deliver insight into the mechanisms that drive herpesvirus
reactivation during co-infection and will increase our understanding of parasite modulation of tissue
resident macrophages. Harnessing the power of mouse model pathogens, these studies will advance our
understanding of pathogen co-infection."
11046024,"Project Summary/Abstract
The proposed effort is focused on integrating community voices into existing organizational efforts to advance
linguistic inclusion in clinical research. Census data indicate that close to 1 in 5 people in the United States
(US) speak a language other than English at home. This number is significantly higher in urban areas, but rural
areas and midsized communities are also seeing a growing increase in the number of people who speak
languages other than English. Despite the growth in linguistic diversity in the US, linguistic diversity in clinical
trial and research participation overall remains limited. Linguistic inclusion is paramount to bringing more
treatments to all people more quickly. Inclusive samples reduce the ever-present bias towards English-
speaking individuals that inhibits generalizability to the broader population; whilst failure to include, fuels
homogeneity in trial participation and further stymies translation. Through our work with the Boston University
Clinical Translational Science Institute we have launched efforts to advance organizational changes to support
linguistic inclusion. This study builds on those efforts and is specifically designed to increase participation
Spanish-speaking patient participation in the design of our linguistic inclusion efforts. Through participatory
planning, we will engage patients with staff and researcher champions in the development of patient-informed
culturally and linguistically appropriate outreach and educational materials and researcher education.
Participatory planning can facilitate engagement and ensure that services reflect the needs of those on the
receiving end. As such, our specific aims are threefold. We will 1) Explore Spanish-speaking patients’
perspectives, preferences, unmet needs when considering joining clinical trials, and barriers to participation; 2)
employ a participatory planning process to design a) a messaging for a campaign focused on clinical trials
participation for Spanish-speaking patients; b) a patient-informed educational manual; and c) a “From Their
Voices” video for investigators that will be available in the IRB website; and 3) disseminate campaign
messaging and educational manual and video among Spanish-speaking patients, BUMC researchers and
more broadly. Solutions that lead to diverse linguistic representation among research participants are critical
for identifying and increasing access to specialized novel treatments that are effective for diverse racial, ethnic,
and cultural groups, and may, thus, serve to help reduce health disparities."

Tissue engineering provides a strategy for developing better biomaterials for use in congenital heart surgery.
Results of our clinical trials evaluating the use of tissue engineered vascular grafts (TEVGs) in congenital heart
surgery have demonstrated the growth capacity of the TEVG making it the first man made graft with growth
potential. However, results of these trials have also revealed that stenosis is the most common graft-related
complication and the principle hurdle preventing its widespread clinical use. Recently, we have identified a novel
immune-regulatory protein encoded by the LYST gene. Mutations of the LYST gene dramatically reduce the
incidence of TEVG stenosis in murine models. In this proposal, we will investigate the cellular and molecular
mechanisms underlying the formation of LYST-mediated TEVG stenosis. We will use a on-demand inducible
LYST-mutant mouse to determine the critical temporal factors underling this process. Next, we will use a
conditional LYST-mutant model to elucidate the roles of macrophages and determine the critical cell type(s)
responsible for driving LYST-mediated TEVG stenosis. Finally, we will evaluate the role of extracellular vesicle-
dependent intercellular signaling on the formation of LYST-mediated TEVG stenosis. Successful completion of
these studies would open the door to rationally designing strategies to inhibit the formation of TEVG stenosis
based on modulating LYST function. The development of an improved TEVG with growth capacity has the
potential to improve outcomes for children born with congenital heart disease."

11044582,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a type of non-invasive brain stimulation that applies constant,
low levels of direct electrical current to the scalp to modulate brain excitability. While tDCS is used in
neurorehabilitation to augment motor learning, the evidence supporting this use is somewhat inconclusive, with
many reports of null findings. Current study designs do not adequately control for participants’ expectations
about tDCS, which may exert a powerful placebo effect on motor learning (as well as cognition, pain, or
anxiety). The long-term goal is to maximize motor learning by considering person-centered perceptions of brain
stimulation in addition to the effects of electrical stimulation itself. The overall objectives in this R21 application
are to demonstrate that expectations about tDCS (i) play a significant role in enhancing motor learning,
independent of any real stimulation (i.e., an expectancy effect vs. a treatment effect of tDCS) and (ii) can be
leveraged to maximize the benefits of tDCS in enhancing motor learning. The central hypothesis is that higher
expectations about the efficacy of tDCS are associated with more skill improvement following motor practice,
even in placebo conditions (sham tDCS). The rationale for this project is that considering people’s expectations
about tDCS will not only improve the reproducibility and rigor of future tDCS research, but will also maximize
the overall benefit of tDCS for improving and restoring health. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing
two specific aims: 1) Determine the extent to which priming expectations of tDCS will modulate motor skill
learning and 2) Determine the extent to which sham tDCS improves motor skill learning. For the primary aim,
suggestive information will be used to prime participants’ expectations to be more positive or more negative
prior to motor training with sham stimulation. For the secondary aim, the effects of unprimed tDCS during
motor training will be compared to a control group with no exposure to the tDCS device at all (motor training
only). The research proposed in this application in innovative, in the applicant’s opinion, because it is a major
departure from the status quo of tDCS research by considering and measuring how participants’ expectations
of tDCS affect motor learning and rehabilitation, independent from any effect of the stimulation itself. The
proposed research is significant because it is expected to shift current research and clinical practice paradigms
that use tDCS for treatment. Ultimately, adopting an integrative health approach that considers how people’s
perceptions and expectations of tDCS (and other non-invasive brain stimulation techniques) will have a greater
impact on health and health care than simply focusing on parameters of the electrical stimulation itself."
11044600,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Laminopathies, or LMNA mutations, are hereditary diseases that alter the integrity of the cellular
biomechanics and they are associated with a wide range of diseases including neuromuscular, cardiac,
metabolic disorders and premature aging syndromes. Laminopathies are caused by mutations in the
LMNA gene, which encodes for the nuclear envelope proteins, lamin A and C. Most LMNA mutations
affect skeletal and cardiac muscle by mechanisms that remain incompletely understood. However,
since the lamins stabilize mechanically the nucleus, LMNA mutations alter the integrity of the cellular
biomechanics. It is believed that mutated A-type lamins disrupt the integrity of the cell nuclear
membrane, resulting in nuclear breakage and cell death in tissues exposed to mechanical stress. In
addition, LMNA mutations alter the interaction between the nucleus and the cytoskeleton, “perturbing
cellular force transmission” and preventing nuclear movement of proteins that are needed for healthy
cell function. During the past three years we have investigated the biomechanics of LMNA mutations in
cardiac cells using atomic force microscopy (AFM). LMNA mutations perturb cardiomyocyte gene
expression and biomechanical properties and are the #2 cause of DCMs, leading to heart failure (HF),
arrhythmias, transplantation, and premature death. DCMs are heart muscle diseases that account for
60% of cardiomyopathy cases, are frequently genetic, and are the #1 and #3 causes of heart
transplantation and heart failure. Tragically, DCM strikes young people causing disproportionately high
morbidity (medically, socially, economically, etc.). There exists a clear need for better DCM treatments
for the nearly 1M affected US adults (~1:250). ~50% of cases of DCM are genetic due to >50 DCM
genes, including LMNA. LMNA mutations cause 8% of DCM with a malignant arrhythmia-prone
phenotype, prompting defibrillator implantation (ACC/AHA/HFSA 2017 Guidelines). Since DCM is a
disease characterized by biomechanical impairment of the heart, it is pivotal to understand the cellular
biomechanics and biophysics of this pathology which may bring novel insights that would benefit patient
treatments. In this work we propose to assess how mechanical stresses affect cardiac spheroids
carrying the LMNA mutation. We hypothesis that mechanobiological pathways have the key to find
novel therapeutics for LMNA mutations."

11036084,"People with HIV (PWH) who use stimulants experience profound intersectional stigma and discrimination
that can cause considerable psychosocial stress. An overactive, unresolved stress response fuels systemic
inflammation, which may be a common pathway linking psychosocial stressors to complex neuropathology in
HIV. Chronic stress can disrupt central nervous system functions that regulate reward processing. Our team
and others have shown that these pathophysiologic alterations are amplified by stimulant use and potentiate
neuropsychiatric symptoms. However, the inflammatory mechanisms through which stress affects brain
networks that subserve substance use and psychiatric multi-morbidity in HIV remain unknown. The
overarching goal of this proposal is to identify neuroimmune mechanisms that underlie the intersection of social
stigma, anhedonia, and altered reward processing in PWH who use stimulants (e.g., cocaine,
methamphetamine). Embracing the experimental rigor of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design, we will
leverage an evidence-based positive affect intervention (ARTEMIS) as a mechanistic probe to elucidate the
neural and immunologic substrates linking psychosocial stress to substance use and depression in PWH. With
this translational approach, we aim to: (1) Investigate the causal link between ARTEMIS-induced
improvements in anhedonia and neural functioning in reward circuitry using resting-state and task-based
functional MRI; (2) Evaluate the effects of ARTEMIS on transcriptional control pathways and downstream
markers of peripheral inflammation; and (3) Test whether reductions in proinflammatory markers have positive
feedback on reward functioning and stimulant use. To achieve these specific aims, we will enroll 189 PWH who
currently use stimulants and have suppressed HIV viral load. Participants will be randomly assigned on a 2:1
ratio to receive ARTEMIS or a wait-list control. To support durable HIV viral suppression throughout the trial, all
participants will receive smartphone-based contingency management for ART adherence. Assessments at 3-
and 6-month follow-ups will characterize changes in neural functioning and leukocyte signaling as plausible
mediators of ARTEMIS effects on behavioral outcomes. Our innovative and clinically important proposal is
highly responsive to RFA-DA-24-005 and will advance our basic understanding of the neuroimmune pathways
underlying psychological resilience to social stress that may mitigate substance use and depression in PWH.
This proposal provides a scientifically rigorous model for examining the causal associations amongst these
prevalent comorbidities in a population that is critical to ending the HIV epidemic, while also providing
participants with the benefit of an evidence-based intervention with a transdiagnostic target. The results of this
mechanistic trial will identify preclinical targets for novel pharmacotherapies linked to reward circuitry."
11039910,"Project Summary:
 Obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus accelerate aging shortening the duration of healthspan. Conversely,
chronic calorie restriction extends healthspan. Most research aimed at understanding the mechanism by which
calorie restriction slows aging has focused on insulin and downstream signaling cascades. Similarly, the
accelerated aging in type 2 diabetes is largely attributed to dysfunctional insulin signaling. Glucagon, a hormone
that counter-regulates insulin, is commonly affected by these same interventions.
 We have shown that glucagon receptor deletion decreases median lifespan by 35% in normal weight mice.
Glucagon receptor deletion shortens lifespan to a greater degree in diet induced obese mice and prevents the
extension in lifespan resulting from calorie restriction. This proposes that the hyperglucagonemia in obesity may
be protective against obesity accelerated aging and that glucagon is essential for calorie restriction to extend
lifespan.
 Although the role of glucagon receptor signaling in aging has not been heavily investigated, the rigor of this
work is supported by known effects of glucagon on downstream messengers that extend healthspan. Both
AMPK activity and cyclic AMP are established mediators that extend healthspan. Glucagon activates AMPK
and increases cAMP.
 Highlighting the significance of this proposal, Glucagon receptor agonists are entering the market for the
treatment of diabetes and obesity. To understand the potential impact of these agonists, we propose to study
the role of glucagon receptor signaling in normal aging, the accelerated aging in obesity, and the slowed aging
resulting from calorie restriction.
 We propose 2 aims that focus on genetic (Aim 1) and pharmacological (Aim 2) manipulation to increase
glucagon receptor signaling. We will combine these models with dietary models of obesity and calorie restriction
and with genetic models of normal glucagon receptor signaling and glucagon receptor knockout to better
understand the role of glucagon receptor signaling in normal aging, obesity accelerated aging, and the slowed
aging resulting from calorie restriction.
 We have established that glucagon is integral in extending lifespan in calorie restriction and maintaining
lifespan in obesity. We appreciate that insulin plays a key role in aging, but also recognize that pharmacologically
targeting insulin signaling is limited because of the key role of insulin in glucose homeostasis. Conversely,
glucagon receptor agonists are safe. In turn, this research provides a unique opportunity to identify a new,
therapeutically viable target to extend healthspan and lifespan."

Key words: eNOS, Vascular Dementia, α5β1 integrin, exercise, therapeutics
Abstract:
One common element between VaD and COVID-19 is the involvement of α5β1 integrin: a viable
receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and whose expression levels increase with age in the bilateral carotid
artery stenosis (BCAS) model of VaD. While the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to enter and alter brain
function is still being debated, VaD associated cognitive decline is better understood as a result
of chronic failure and disruption of the cerebrovasculature. As VaD is a progressive disease, of
which both physiology and symptoms worsen over time, the age-associated increase in α5β1
expression may be contributing to the ultimate development of cognitive dysfunction. Moreover,
if the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to α5β1 leads to overactivation or increase in expression of the
integrin, then COVID-19-associated cognitive decline may occur in a similar manner to that of
VaD. Exercise has been shown to improve VaD associated cognitive dysfunction, but the
mechanism and whether α5β1 integrin is involved is unknown. Thus, α5β1 integrin’s relationship
to cognitive decline and its potential to enhance exercise induced benefits through the following
project aims will be explored: using eNOS-deficient mice as a model of VaD, I will correlate
integrin α5β1 expression to age-related pathology (Aim 1) and determine if the combined
treatment of ATN-161 and exercise provides synergistic improvements to VaD outcome (Aim 2)."

Motor cortex historically has been viewed as a relatively stable region of the brain, with static cortical dynamics mapping to
particular movements. Recent work has questioned these assumptions, asserting that the brain’s internal map of the external
world drifts over time. This phenomena, known as representational drift, may provide insight into how the brain adapts to
learn new behavior. Modeling representational drift and establishing its connection to motor learning are the primary aims
of this proposal.
Currently, there is no standardized metric to track representational drift over time. Leveraging our repository of motor and
premotor neuronal recordings, we look to establish a common framework for calculating the rate at which this drift occurs.
To do this, we will apply unbiased, probabilistic methods (e.g., continuous-time hidden Markov models, switching linear
dynamical systems) that extract discrete latent states to the neural data. Models will be evaluated based on ofﬂine decoding
performance, and drift will be calculated by the transition rate across latent states.
After establishing a common modeling framework, we will analyze how drift rates change across various motor tasks and
levels of exertion. To accomplish this, we will employ our novel, unconstrained recording platform, which allows for the
simultaneous capture of markerless kinematics and wirelessly transmitted neural data. By analyzing the neural data collected
during diverse movements, we can assess how both overall levels activity and different types of behavior impact rates of
representational drift.
By determining how physical activity impacts representational drift, we can better understand the relationship between drift
and rates of motor learning. To do this we will study to cohorts recovering from motor deﬁcit. One cohort will integrate drift-
enhancing activities during recovery and another will not. By monitoring rates of representational drift and motor recovery,
we can evaluate the effect that drift has on motor learning. This knowledge can then be leveraged to improve treatments for
those recovering from brain-related movement disorders, like stroke and Parkinson’s."

 Anxiety and anxiety-related disorders (AARD) are notable risk factors for alcohol use problems (AUP) and
their co-occurrence (AARD-AUP) results in tremendous health costs and societal burden. The self-medication
model states that those with AARD use alcohol to numb or cope with arousing and distressing negative
emotional states; however, longitudinal evidence for self-medication is mixed and psychological treatments
integrate cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) skills for substance use disorders with CBT interventions for
AARD have demonstrated modest success. The heterogeneity in these findings is likely influenced by dynamic
and person-specific factors. We hypothesize that results from person-specific analyses can improve our
understanding of this heterogeneity and can be harnessed to personalize interventions for AUP. Personalized
interventions have the potential to increase symptom reduction and rate of change, as well as therapy retention
and alliance. Modeling person-specific patterns of psychopathology has been challenging due to historical
limitations with data collection and statistical analyses. However, increasing access to digital phenotyping –
an innovative method for collecting single-subject intensive ecological momentary assessment (EMA)
integrated with passive sensing smartphone data streams (e.g., GPS data, accelerometer, Bluetooth/call/SMS
data) – offers a compelling solution for the development and evaluation of truly personalized psychological
interventions. Such data can be used to generate statistical models of a single individual’s pattern of behavior
over time. Previous data-driven (i.e., feedback-based) interventions have demonstrated success; however, it is
unclear whether using person-specific models to adapt an active intervention reduces symptoms or improves
therapeutic efficiency (i.e., rate of change), therapeutic retention, or therapeutic alliance.
 This K99R00 award will provide training in passive sensing data collection methods and conduct of clinical
trials, as well as continued training in alcohol research. In the K99 phase, I will build on previous expertise
constructing person-specific models and identifying person-specific factors testing self-medication models of
AARD-AUP, developing a method for personalizing a CBT skills-based intervention. In the R00 phase, the
feasibility of this intervention will be tested in a pilot three-group parallel randomized clinical trial (RCT), which
will test the feasibility of a personalized CBT skills-based interventions compared to two control conditions
testing the relative efficacy of personalization and personalization method, respectively. In the personalized
condition, the therapist will review identified influential factors from the person-specific model, treat these
factors using CBT skills, and track them using the mindLAMP digital phenotyping platforms – testing a data-
driven method for personalizing and adapting the content of each session. Findings will inform future
R01 applications testing personalized interventions for problematic alcohol use."
11040503,"ABSTRACT PROJECT SUMMARY
Muscular Dystrophy (MD) is a family of genetic disorders characterized by progressive muscle wasting, loss of
muscle function, and premature death. MD pathology is driven by sarcolemma instability resulting in membrane
rupture, necrosis, and myofiber death. Research has demonstrated that MD myofibers have increased cellular
Ca2+ levels and that mitochondrial membrane permeability pore (MPTP) dependent myofiber death contributes
to MD. There is evidence that MD myofiber mitochondria have elevated Ca2+ levels, but isolated MD mitochondria
also have reduced Ca2+ uptake rates and increased expression of MCUb, a negative regulator of Ca2+ uptake.
In the heart limiting mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake protects from MPTP-dependent cell death, while genetically
promoting Ca2+ overload leads to increased MPTP-activation and cell death. We will therefore test the role of
mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis in MD (Aim #1). We will disrupt the main mitochondrial Ca2+ efflux
mechanism by deleting the myofiber mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (Nclx) in the Mdx model of MD to test
the hypothesis that Ca2+ overload promotes MPTP-dependent myofiber death and pathology in MD. We will also
disrupt the acute mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake mechanism by deleting the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (Mcu) in
myofbers in the Mdx model of MD to test the hypothesis that inhibiting Ca2+ uptake will reduce MPTP-dependent
myofiber death pathology in MD. We will delete myofiber Mcub in the Mdx model of MD to test the hypothesis
that increased MCUb expression in MD myofibers is protective in MD disease. To better understand the role of
MPTP in MD disease we will directly target the MPTP genetically. We have recently demonstrated that adenine
nucleotide translocator (ANT) proteins represent one of at least two protein species that comprise the MPTP. It
has recently been observed that isolated MD myofiber mitochondria have increased sensitivity to MPTP-
activation as well as a specific increase in ANT2 expression. We will therefore test the role of ANT-dependent
MPTP activation in MD (Aim #2). We will study Ant1 knockout mice in the Sgcd-/- model of MD, which lack the
main muscle ANT isoform, to test the hypothesis that ANT-dependent MPTP (MPTPANT) contributes to MD
pathology. We will delete myofiber Ant2 in the Sgcd-/- model of MD to test the hypothesis that ANT2 upreglation
in MD mitochondria specifically promotes MPTP activation and pathology in MD. Additionally, we will generate
mice lacking all murine isoforms of ANT in the Sgcd-/- model of MD to measure the total contribution of MPTPANT
to MD. Since we have demonstrated that inhibition of cyclophilin D (CypD) in the context of total ANT knockout
is sufficient to completely inhibit MPTP, we will treat Sgcd-/- mice lacking all ANT isoforms with the CypD inhibitor
Debio-025 to test what proportion of total myofiber death and MD pathology is dependent on MPTP-activation.
This research will be the first test of the role of mitochondrial Ca2+ in MD pathobiology and the first study of the
ANT model of MPTP in a physiological system. This research may uncover novel strategies to treat MD, for
which there is currently no cure or effective treatment."

Critical social and vascular risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) occur in
childhood, early adulthood, or midlife, decades before ADRD is typically diagnosed. Most cohorts dedicated to
the study of aging are initiated in mid to late life, and are therefore not ideal for evaluating the effects of early
life risk factors. Synthetic cohorts, which pool multiple data sources that in combination span early to late life,
provide an unparalleled opportunity to rigorously evaluate lifecourse mechanisms of ADRD. Lifecourse
research, especially when based on synthetic cohorts, faces several methodological challenges related to
survival, enrollment and attrition that are differential across the pooled studies, and reverse causation from
incipient dementia. The long-term goal of our research is to pinpoint how and when we can intervene to
prevent or delay the onset of ADRD. Yet, the differential selection forces in a synthetic cohort can make it
impossible to identify protective factors, can spuriously make harmful factors appear innocuous, and can
provide incorrect guidance on prevention priorities. In this study, we propose to pool eight data sources
comprising children, young, middle-aged, and older adults to create a SYNthetic Birth cohort for research on
ADRD (SynBAD), correcting for differential survival, enrollment or attrition, and reverse causation, allowing us
to rigorously evaluate the effects of lifecourse social and vascular risk factors. SynBAD will include the
Bogalusa Heart Study, the Muscatine study, the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979, The National
Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, the Coronary Artery Risk in Development in Young Adults,
the Health and Retirement Study, the REasons for Geographic And Racial Disparities in Stroke, and the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Studies. SynBAD will be large (N=304,171) and exceptionally
diverse, facilitating research on the drivers of ADRD among women (56%) and Black individuals (25%).
Specifically, we propose to (Aim 1) create a diverse synthetic birth cohort (age 0 to 90) for the study of social
and vascular risk factors for ADRD, incorporating corrections for differential survival, enrollment, and attrition;
(Aim 2), evaluate and correct for reverse causation -- in which incipient dementia induces changes in risk
factors -- by using a reverse Mendelian Randomization approach based on identifying the age-specific effects
of a genetic risk score for ADRD on risk factors; (Aim 3), rigorously estimate the causal effects of social and
vascular factors on ADRD risk using the synthetic cohort corrected for selection and reverse causation biases;
and (Aim 4), quantify reduction in lifetime ADRD cases and ADRD racial disparities that could be achieved with
a variety of hypothetical interventions on social or vascular risk factors at different ages. Given the role of
biological sex with social and vascular risk factors and dementia risk, we will allow for distinct risk models for
men and women. This study will improve the validity of lifecourse research using synthetic cohorts and provide
more valid and public health relevant estimates of the effects of social and vascular determinants of ADRD."

We propose to determine how the dynamic mechanical environment of the valve regulates the
attachment, invasion, and differentiation of host cells into “off-the-shelf” decellularized tissue
engineered heart valves (TEHVs). We hypothesize that dynamic mechanical stretch and fluid
shear stress regulate repopulation of the TEHV matrix by enhancing and aligning 3D matrix
adhesions and activating latent TGF-beta from the matrix. To test our hypothesis, biopolymer
scaffolds seeded with fibroblasts will be cast in stretchable wells and microfluidic chambers until
remodeled into isotropic or aligned neo-tissues and then decellularized in situ. We will then
quantify the extent to which vascular and circulating cells adhere to and invade the matrix under
cyclic stretch or dynamic flow conditions relevant to in vivo implantation. Cell attachment,
infiltration, proliferation, apoptosis, phenotype, and endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition
markers will be quantitatively monitored over time. TGF-beta activation and 3D matrix adhesion
protein content and alignment will be examined, and associated signal transduction pathways
will be interrogated to determine the mechanisms governing the cell responses. The results
from this systematic study will have a direct impact on TEHV development by determining the
signals that aid (or hinder) host cell repopulation of the valve matrix with the goal of optimizing
valve design for adaptive remodeling under complex in vivo conditions. This diversity
supplement will enable additional studies within the scope of the parent grant in addition to
mentoring activities to support a student from a marginalized community."

11035400,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is increasingly used to enhance perceptual and cognitive
performance in healthy individuals and in individuals with neurological and psychiatric disorders. But even after
>8000 publications and strong evidence suggesting positive effects, clinical applications of tACS to improve
language outcomes in stroke survivors with aphasia (SWA) are few and far between. Little guidance is available
from the existing literature to effectively plan tACS treatment protocols in SWA.
The selection of tACS parameters is complicated by large underlying anatomical and functional heterogeneity
after stroke. Given this heterogeneity, our overarching hypothesis is that tACS efficacy will depend on stimulation
target selection, frequency and effectiveness of electric field coverage at individual patient level. Our proposed
project seeks to examine the effects of individualized selection of tACS targets and frequency (Aim 1), based
on detailed analyses of lesion location, residual functional activity, and residual brain oscillatory activity on
phonological short-term memory (pSTM) performance in chronic SWA. We hypothesize that individualized tACS
will enhance the size and reliability of tACS response. This project is motivated by individual variability that we
observed in our preliminary data from 9 SWA. Independent of Aim 1, we will also explore how stroke
characteristics influence residual functional and oscillatory brain activity underlying pSTM (Aim 2).
Our project fits perfectly within the scope of the R21 Exploratory/Developmental grant because it is at “early and
conceptual stages” and is within one of NIDCD’s scientific foci—treating “disorders of human communication”.
Notable innovations of the proposed project are our novel use of (1) multimodal structural, functional and
electrophysiological techniques to optimize tACS parameters in individual SWA, and (2) individualized electric
field models to optimize tACS electrode arrangements, both in service to increase the efficacy of tACS.
While ideally aphasia therapy would be ecologically valid and would enhance functional communication
outcomes, the proposed use of a lab-based controlled task and focus on pSTM is needed at this stage to gain a
better understanding of the effects of tACS in SWA. This knowledge will facilitate future use of tACS as an
adjunctive treatment to boost functional outcomes. Presently, a proof-of-concept study is crucial to establish a
sound methodological basis for developing effective neurorehabilitation strategies using tACS in SWA."

GOAL OF THE PARENT AWARD. This administrative supplement is submitted by the Nebraska Center for the
Prevention of Obesity Diseases Through Dietary Molecules (NPOD), currently in Phase 2 COBRE funding at the
University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL). NPOD's mission is to prevent, treat, and cure obesity and co-morbidities
by harnessing the power of bioactive food compounds to ameliorate the adverse health effects of obesity. NPOD
Phase 2 is guided by four specific aims: 1) Increase NPOD's critical mass of researchers by hiring five early
career investigators, recruiting new early stage and senior investigators using pilot and seed grant funding, and
continuing to develop strategic alliances with complementary programs; 2) acquire additional equipment for the
research core and formalize experimental design services offered through the administrative core; 3) enhance
the center's mentoring structure and collaborative, multidisciplinary environment; and 4) implement hiring and
recruitment approaches to expand integration of fundamental nutrition and obesity research with clinical,
translational, and community research.
RESEARCH QUESTION FOR THE SUPPLEMENT AWARD. The proposed research will explore whether the selection
of genomic variants in gut bacteria by milk extracellular vesicles (MEVs) alters energy homeostasis in
infants. We have pioneered a novel line of discovery by demonstrating that small extracellular vesicles (sEVs)
and their regulatory cargo do not originate exclusively in endogenous synthesis but may also be absorbed from
milk (milk sEVs, MEVs). Human milk is a rich source of MEVs, and breastfed infants consume approximately
176 trillion MEVs per day. In contrast, formula is essentially free of MEVs and 90% of MEVs are degraded in milk
that was frozen in milk banks or at home due to ice crystal formation. The oral bioavailability of MEVs is
approximately 50% and the portion of MEVs that escapes absorption interacts with the gut microbiome. MEVs
do not only alter bacterial communities, but they also select genomic variants in bacteria where the variants are
transcribed into mRNA and clustered in pathways of energy metabolism (purines, glucose). Other studies are
consistent with these observations and reveal an up to 120-fold increase in purine metabolites in formula-fed
infants and an up to 12.5-fold increase in glucose metabolites in bacteria cultured in media containing a
nutritionally relevant concentration of MEVs compared to MEV-free cultures.
Motivated by these discoveries, we hypothesize that the dietary intake of MEVs alters energy homeostasis in
infants. We will leverage our complementary expertise in bacterial evolution, advanced computational biology,
and the development of innovative “energy sensor” mice to complete three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will assess
the selection of genomic variants in MEV-defined cultures of infant feces. Specifically, we will assess the selection
of genomic variants by MEVs using metagenomics analysis, their transcription using RNA-sequencing analysis,
and the effects on pathways implicated in energy homeostasis using metabolomics analysis. In Aim 2, we will
assess the effect of MEV selection on a host-adapted infant gut symbiont (Bifidobacterium infantis) in infants.
Specifically, we will leverage existing fecal metagenomic data to characterize how MEVs select genetic variants
in a host-adapted infant gut symbiont by comparing variants from infants fed frozen pasteurized milk or fresh
milk and test the effects of these variants on enteric inflammatory responses. In Aim 3, we will develop NAD(H),
NADPH, and ATP sensor mice in collaboration with the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences' Genetic
Models Core and assess if MEV-defined diet consumption alters energy homeostasis in neonate mice.
HOW THIS PROJECT BENEFITS FROM A TEAM SCIENCE APPROACH. This research will benefit the IDeA community
by supporting three project leaders and four research cores across Nebraska, Nevada, and Arkansas, and two
veteran scientist consultants in Kansas and Nevada. A team science approach is essential to project success
because the combined expertise required is not currently co-located in one of the participating IDeA states. Only
together do we have the necessary expertise and instrumentation to conduct the proposed research. Our team
comprises Drs. Qiuming Yao (UNL; NPOD project leader in Phase 2), Steven Frese (University of Nevada, Reno;
not supported by NPOD), Jingjie Hao (director of NPOD's Biomedical and Obesity Research Core (BORC)), and
leverages the Genomics Core Facility and Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics Core Facilities at the University
of Nebraska Medical Center, the Genetic Models Core at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, and
UNL's BORC. The parent COBRE grant's principal investigator (PI), Dr. Janos Zempleni, will contribute expertise
in milk extracellular vesicles and share archived samples.
Ultimately, this project promises to benefit the six million infants annually who consume formula and frozen milk
in the United State, e.g., recommending new milk storage protocols that preserve MEVs through economically
and technologically feasible approaches that will not raise regulatory agency concerns. This research aligns with
NPOD's mission, and we have identified a path to future funding from NIDDK and NCHID (NOT-DK-19-007).
NPOD's administrative core will support the team through reciprocal visits by project leaders and an in-person
workshop prior to project initiation attended by PI, project leaders and their staff, consultants, and two speakers."

In 2020, an estimated 77,240 people in the US will be diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and
19,940 will die from this cancer. NHL incidence rates increased over the last half of the 20th century and only
recently stabilized. In parallel, NHL survival rates began improving in the mid-1990s with the advent of
improved treatment strategies, leading to the current 5-year survival rate of 74%. These trends have led to a
growth in the number of NHL survivors, estimated at over 757,000 in 2019. To address the unmet health
needs of this patient population, we established the Lymphoma Epidemiology of Outcomes (LEO) cohort study,
which by June 2020 will have enrolled over 13,000 NHL patients and have <1% lost to follow-up. The LEO
cohort supports multiple grants and has generated novel and high impact findings on NHL prognosis and
survivorship. To continue and expand the key contributions of LEO, in this renewal we propose to: 1) Extend
recruitment at all 8 LEO centers, with a goal of recruiting 3400 newly diagnosed NHL patients focused on
Hispanic (N=900), African American (N=580), and Asian (N=200) participants (doubling the current sample
size for these groups) and adolescent and young adult (AYA) participants age 18-39 years (N=870; 87%
increase), and non-metro and rural patients of all ages and race/ethnicities (N=1,208, 72% increase), for a total
cohort of 16,500 patients; 2) Review all pathology diagnoses and maintain a NHL tumor bank that includes an
H&E slide, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples in a tissue microarray, and extracted tumor DNA
and RNA; 3) Collect a peripheral blood sample and maintain a central biorepository of DNA, serum, plasma
and buffy coat; 4) Annotate and harmonize all cases with clinical, epidemiologic, pathology and treatment data,
including development of new informatics enhancements to capture clinical data from electronic health records,
digital pathology images and linkage to public databases to enhance data on environmental exposures and
socioeconomic factors; 5) Prospectively follow patients in the cohort to ascertain disease progression/relapse,
retreatment, transformation, second cancers, survival (including cause of death), updated exposures, patient-
reported outcomes (PROs), and other long-term health outcomes; and 6) Facilitate research projects that use
this infrastructure, promote interactions with NCI-supported clinical trials networks, patient advocacy groups,
and other collaborators. The goal of this Early-Stage Investigator Diversity Supplement is to improve
treatment decision-making and reduce the burden of treatment for older adults with indolent
lymphoma. We will achieve these aims through close coordination of each of the participating centers,
supported by four cores (Administration; Clinical; Pathology & Biospecimens; and Biostatistics & Informatics).
The LEO cohort is an exceptional resource that supports a broad research agenda aimed at identifying novel
clinical, epidemiologic, germline genetic, tumor, and treatment factors that influence NHL prognosis and
survivorship focusing on NCI research priorities in AYA, minority, and rural populations. LEO is led by
international experts in clinical and epidemiologic research on NHL, thereby driving the translation of new
findings to the clinic and the population."

Background: Increased arterial stiffness has been associated with indicators of damage to the brain including
presence of white matter hyperintensity, infarctions, and brain atrophy as assessed with magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI). When vessels lose their ability to mechanically absorb the effects of pulsatile flow, that
pulsatility is transmitted to the vasculature in the brain leading to deleterious changes in the brain tissue.
Understanding the effect of ultrasound measured viscoelastic mechanical properties of central conduit (e.g.,
carotid) arteries relative to MRI measured brain health indicators could result in a very important tool for
predicting and managing changes in brain function. This research project aims to address these unmet and
critical needs to develop techniques for the accurate and translatable ultrasound measurement of
viscoelastic arterial mechanical properties and evaluate associations with structural changes in the brain.
Methods: Ultrasound is a first-line imaging modality for vascular evaluation, but most clinical scanners do not
have the ability to evaluate the elastic or viscoelastic mechanical properties of vessels in an accurate,
quantitative manner with high temporal resolution. In the first cycle of this grant, we developed an ultrasound-
based method called arterial dispersion ultrasound vibrometry (ADUV) that utilizes acoustic radiation force to
stimulate high-frequency (200-1500 Hz) waves in the arterial wall, followed by high frame rate ultrasound to
measure the wave motion, which is used to characterize arterial viscoelastic mechanical properties.
However, our research revealed that several aspects of ADUV could be further improved before being used on
a daily basis in the clinic. Among these improvements are increasing the wave motion signal-to-noise ratio,
making precise measurements of the vessel geometry with ultrasound, and improving our inversion and
classification frameworks. With these improved ADUV methods, we will evaluate how the viscoelastic
properties of the carotid artery are associated with the health of the brain as judged using MRI brain
morphology data. With the strong collaborative team including expertise in cardiovascular medicine, radiology,
ultrasound engineering, waveguide modeling, inverse problems, data reduction and classification, we will bring
ADUV closer to widespread translation with the following Specific Aims:
Aim 1) Optimize ADUV to enhance motion measurement quality for more accurate and precise
 mechanical property estimation.
Aim 2) Develop advanced mathematical models for estimation of arterial mechanical properties and
 classification of disease state.
Aim 3) Correlate ADUV measurements of carotid artery viscoelasticity with MRI indicators of brain
health in patients."

 Despite efforts to prevent suicide, US rates are climbing, and suicide is the second leading cause of death
amongst youth. Although promising approaches are available for preventative interventions with youth at-risk
for suicide, they demonstrate modest benefit, and recent reviews have concluded that new developments are
required that facilitate not only greater effectiveness, but also enhance treatment engagement, adherence, and
continuity of care amongst these young people. Digital tools, especially personal smartphones, are promising
avenues to address these issues and can be used to provide a unique understanding of proximal risk factors,
including psychological distress, anhedonia and behavioral withdrawal, and sleep disturbance amongst high-
risk individuals. Furthermore, digital methods can provide ongoing supportive patient contact to support the
reduction of suicide risk. The overall aim of this Fast-track SBIR proposal is to enhance the effectiveness of
selective and indicated prevention for youth who are received outpatient mental health care by developing and
testing a comprehensive digital platform that allows practitioners to integrate objective mobile sensing and
HIPAA compliant client communication tools into their management of these young people. We have
developed an initial MVP version of these products, and in Phase I will utilize user-centered design principles
to enhance the product fit with typical service delivery systems found in healthcare organizations working with
high-risk individuals (i.e., intensive outpatient services). The aim of Phase II is to further optimize these
products and conduct a pragmatic clinical trial of the effectiveness, feasibility, and acceptability of the products
in a real world intensive outpatient clinical service. We will utilize the data generated by this trial to improve
adoption, implementation fidelity, and sustained use of these tools, guided by an implementation science

Kinases, a class of proteins with more than 500 members in the human proteome, are important regulators of
biological processes in health and disease. Kinases have proven to be excellent drug targets with more than 70
FDA approved medicines that target kinases. Despite this success, most kinases are understudied, and details
of their functions are poorly understood. The NEK family of 11 kinases (NEK1 through NEK11) is a particularly
understudied set of kinases that play roles in key biological processes like the cell cycle, ciliogenesis, and the
DNA damage response (DDR), all with relevance to cancer and human health. These kinases have emerging
links to numerous cancers, diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, ciliopathies, and ALS. In this project we will
use an efficient kinase systems-based approach to create an enabling suite of chemical probes, assays,
reagents, and molecular tools to identify NEK family members that have key roles in cancer. These high-quality
compounds and reagents we generate, which we will freely share, will allow scientists to build a deep
understanding of the physiological and pathological roles members of the NEK family play. In Aim 1 we will
create potent and selective inhibitors of each NEK using iterative medicinal chemistry and state of the art in cell
target engagement assays. In a complementary effort for this aim we will also create inducible NEK knockdown
cell lines. In Aim 2, using compounds and the NEK knockdown lines, we will evaluate the role and importance of
each NEK in a suite of NEK and oncology-relevant cell health and cell biology signaling assays, measuring
effects on proliferation, migration, the cell-cycle, DNA replication, and ciliogenesis. In Aim 3 we will
experimentally determine the substrates of each NEK, locate the NEKs in broader kinase-dependent signaling
pathways, and develop genetically targetable kinase activity reporters for tracking NEK activity within the
endogenous cellular environment. Output from this project will include potent and selective NEK inhibitors, NEK
family-wide assays, details on the impact of NEK inhibition and knockdown on key cancer processes, molecular
tools, and NEK substrate and pathway information. Successful completion will provide a framework and the
resources needed to validate individual NEKs as high quality, druggable targets for the treatment of cancer."

The aim of this proposal is to elucidate how ESCRT (Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport)
machinery is regulated and deployed in neurons. ESCRT is a set of conserved and sequentially-acting protein
complexes that play crucial roles in cellular processes such as endosomal traffic, cytokinesis, and membrane
repair. One important function of ESCRT in neurons is the formation of multivesicular endosomes, which are
critical for proteostasis, signaling, and the formation of extracellular vesicles that carry cargoes critical for
signaling and disease. Despite their central importance, the regulation of neuronal ESCRT complexes remains
poorly understood for two main reasons: First, we lack the tools to visualize their activities in vivo at high
resolution. Second, chronic disruption of ESCRT causes many pleiotropic and secondary phenotypes in
membrane traffic, making it difficult to decipher its mechanisms of action and to test the physiological importance
of ESCRT-dependent events. As a result, it remains unclear how cellular processes like extracellular vesicle
cargo traffic are spatially and temporally regulated within the polarized and complex morphology of neurons. Our
research seeks to fill this gap by developing new visualization and manipulation tools specifically tailored for
studying ESCRT dynamics, using Drosophila neurons as a model. In Aim 1, we will investigate the dynamics of
synaptic ESCRT machinery at endosomes, and explore how neuronal activity influences ESCRT dynamics.
Utilizing quantitative analyses of high-resolution microscopy, we aim to measure ESCRT recruitment to neuronal
endosomes and examine its relation to endosomal and extracellular vesicle cargoes. Aim 2 focuses on devising
new tools for temporal and spatial control of ESCRT and testing the kinetics and spatial organization of
multivesicular endosome biogenesis and the resultant release of extracellular vesicles. These tools will enable
us to engineer inducible systems for controlling ESCRT activities, investigate the temporal sequence of chronic
ESCRT phenotypes, and answer questions about the dynamics and regulation of extracellular vesicle release.
Overall, our research aims to provide mechanistic insights into synapse-specific regulation of ESCRT machinery,
shedding light on its role in synaptic function and disease. Furthermore, our tools will have broad applicability to
the field for studying ESCRT-related questions across different experimental systems, offering opportunities for
manipulating extracellular vesicle release and other ESCRT-dependent processes in diverse cell types or
organisms."
11036168,"Project Summary. Ferroptosis is a regulated form of cell death that is dependent on iron and driven by lipid
peroxidation. Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) plays a central role in inhibiting ferroptosis as it reduces lipid
peroxides to alcohols, which prevents the initiation of lipid peroxidation via iron-mediated Fenton chemistry.
Oxidizable polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have been found to sensitize cells to ferroptosis. Endogenous
PUFAs in the human body only contain nonconjugated double bonds and undergo lipid peroxidation primarily
through the “hydrogen-atom transfer” (HAT) mechanism. On the other hand, we recently discovered that PUFAs
with conjugated double bonds display much higher reactivity toward lipid peroxidation than nonconjugated
PUFAs, and their oxidation proceeds primarily via a “peroxyl radical addition” (PRA) mechanism. Specifically,
conjugated linoleic acid (CLA 18:2) is twice as reactive as nonconjugated linoleic acid (NLA 18:2), while
conjugated linolenic acid (CLA 18:3) is over 8 times more reactive than nonconjugated linolenic acid (NLA 18:3).
CLA 18:2 and CLA 18:3 are found in the diet that includes meat and dairy products from ruminants and some
edible plants. Significantly, it was recently found that CLA 18:3 induces ferroptosis by itself through a mechanism
distinct from canonical ferroptosis inducers, such as GPX4 inhibitors. Furthermore, we found that CLA 18:2 is
much more potent in enhancing ferroptosis in cancer cell lines than any nonconjugated PUFAs. However, the
mechanism of ferroptosis induction or potentiation by CLAs remains to be elucidated. The goal of this project is
to elucidate how the different oxidation mechanisms between NLAs and CLAs lead to their different potency in
inducing ferroptosis. The unique oxidation mechanism of CLAs is expected to lead to the truncation of the fatty
acids and subsequent formation of high levels of aldehydes, which are reactive electrophiles that can form
adducts with nucleophiles, such as proteins, in a biological system. We hypothesize that the PRA peroxidation
mechanism and the resulting high levels of reactive electrophilic products are underlying the mechanism of
ferroptosis induction by conjugated PUFAs. In Aim 1, we will determine the spatial distribution and progression
of lipid peroxidation in cells treated with NLAs or CLAs using stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy
and lipidomics. In Aim 2, we will reveal the protein targets of the electrophilic products of conjugated PUFAs
using protein pulldown with alkynylated probes and determine the gene targets of these products using RNA
sequencing. This project is significant because it will reveal the detailed steps between lipid peroxidation and the
eventual cell death, including the location and progression of lipid peroxidation and protein and gene targets of
lipid electrophiles, all of which could lead to new ways to modulate ferroptosis for the prevention and treatment
of cancer or degenerative diseases. The innovation lies in the concept that the high levels of electrophilic
products of CLAs contribute to the induction of ferroptosis through its high reactivity toward nucleophiles, in situ
imaging of chemical bond changes by SRS microscopy, and the “click” chemistry-based pulldown proteomics."

through the National Research Mentoring Network (NRMN). Aim 1 of the proposal is dedicated to the creation
of a comprehensive five-module course designed to equip more than 300 researchers across all career stages
with the skills necessary for effective mentorship and network building. These modules will cover foundational
concepts of mentorship, strategies for self-assessment and goal setting, practical approaches for forming and
sustaining mentorship networks, and insights into becoming impactful mentors themselves. Aim 2 focuses on
evaluating the shift in participants' perceptions regarding the importance of mentorship and diverse mentorship
networks, utilizing pre- and post-course surveys to measure impact. Aim 3 will assess how the course
influences the development and enhancement of mentorship networks, tracking the formation of new
connections and the improvement of existing ones, thereby facilitating a more inclusive and equitable
biomedical research environment for potentially thousands of researchers. Through this supplement, we aim to
address critical gaps in mentorship practices, fostering a culture of supportive, productive mentorship networks
within the NRMN and beyond."

Bacteria and the viruses that infect them, termed bacteriophages or simply phages, are locked
in a never-ending evolutionary battle. To protect themselves against phages, bacteria have
evolved numerous anti-phage defense systems. Some, like restriction-modification systems or
CRISPR, have been well characterized and harnessed for biotechnological and therapeutic
applications. Recently it has become apparent that there exist many other anti-phage defense
systems and that most of them remain poorly understood. Some newly discovered anti-phage
defense systems use Overcoming Lysogenization Defect (OLD) proteins, which possess a
Toprim domain that can cleave DNA and an ABC-family ATPase domain that can hydrolyze
nucleotide. Our long-term goal is to conduct basic research on OLD proteins to
determine how they interact with DNA and elucidate the molecular mechanisms by
which they contribute to anti-phage defense. OLD proteins can be classified by their
surrounding genetic context, in which Class 1 OLD proteins exist in isolation in the genome
while Class 2 OLD proteins are found immediately proximal to a predicted helicase gene and
form a defense system called the Gabija system. The primary goal of the proposed research is
to test hypotheses about the molecular mechanisms of both Class 1 and Class 2 OLD
proteins, as well as the molecular interactions between Class 2 OLD proteins and their
associated helicases. We will do so through a combination of biochemical assays
characterizing DNA cleavage and nucleotide hydrolysis, and genetic plaque assays and
mutational analysis for phage defense. These experiments will determine whether Class 1
OLD proteins provide anti-phage defense on their own, determine whether predicted Gabija
helicases demonstrate helicase activity, and identify OLD protein amino acids that play
functional roles in phage defense. In addition to the biotechnological opportunities studying
anti-phage defense systems has brought, deepening our understanding of such systems
could, in principle, also help set the stage for the development of potential therapeutic
interventions such as phage therapy."

deaf children who are learning a sign language to communicate. This is important because it makes theories of
language acquisition more inclusive and because deaf children face systemic barriers in accessing and
learning language. The aims of the proposed supplement are threefold. First, it offers the PI of the grant
training in supporting scientists from diverse background. The training would cover topics including: setting
goals and expectations, culturally aware and inclusive mentoring, giving feedback and navigating difficult
conversations, and interrupting interpersonal violence. The second aim is to create professional development
materials for scientists in ASL. There are many resources to support professional development available for
scientists who use a spoken or written language, but very few resources exist in ASL. The PI has developed a
host of trainings on a variety of subjects that have been offered in house. The proposed supplement would
support filming and publishing these materials in ways that scientists across the country could easily access at
any time. The third aim of the proposal is to support postdoctoral training for Kaj Kraus, a queer deaf scientist,
who would help carry out Aim 3 Study 6 from the parent grant."
11042912,"We extend our structural mechanistic studies into eukaryotic transcription to determine the
functions of the conserved and essential Mediator complex during assembly and
disassembly of the RNA polymerase II (pol II) transcription pre-initiation complex (PIC)
and in the divergent transcription that arises from pol II promoters. Building on our recent
success in developing highly efficient in vitro reconstituted transcription system, we will
leverage this system to isolate and dissect a series of PIC-Mediator complexes
representing a range of states, from initiation, to early elongation, to complexes that might
function on divergent promoters. We will address the molecular mechanisms underlying
transitions between these states through structural and biochemical means involving cryo-
EM, cross-linking and mass spectrometry (XL-MS), and multi-wavelength analytical
ultracentrifugation."
11045902,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
There has been much interest in the potential role of social media (SM) use in driving a current mental health
crisis among teens, with a dire need for evidence that goes beyond self-report. One important avenue is to
understand the role of the brain in mediating or moderating the effects of SM use on emotional health and vice
versa. However, there is almost no research addressing these questions, largely due to a lack of fMRI tasks
that can probe the neural correlates of modern SM use. Existing tasks measure neural response to simulated
threat and reward from fictitious peers but are out of date and do a poor job of simulating the SM experience of
today’s youth. We developed a preliminary version of the TeenBrainOnline (TBO) Task, an fMRI task that
mimics key features of SM that are posited to enhance the salience of social feedback, such as quantifiable,
public, and dynamic indicators of peer status. The goal of this project is to further develop and validate this new
developmentally-salient and ecologically-valid task. In Phase 1 (months 1-8), we will program the task for
eyetracking and create stimuli for boys (as we previously only created stimuli for girls) and gender and
racially/ethnically diverse youth to add to the task. We will also use a co-design participatory action approach
with a Youth Research Advisory Board (YRAB) comprised of teens ages 13-17 to add comments to the task,
and to obtain other feedback on potential task improvements. We will then conduct 10 pilot scans, with iterative
improvements to the task based on scan results and YRAB feedback. In Phase 2 (months 9-24), 50 teens
(ages 13-17) with depressive symptoms will complete the final version of TBO during fMRI with eye-tracking,
the older Chatroom Interact (CHAT-I) Task, ecological momentary assessment (EMA) of daily SM use, and
measures of depressive symptoms. In addition to computing split-half reliability, twenty youth will complete the
task again after three months for test-retest reliability. We will evaluate construct validity by testing whether the
task activates brain regions that typically respond to social evaluation (e.g., amygdala, anterior insula, dorsal
and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, and ventral striatum) and elicits visual attention biases using eye-
tracking. Predictive validity will be assessed by attempting to show that ASN activity and attention biases on
TBO predict variability in depressive symptoms at baseline and three months later, and are more predictive
than similar indices from CHAT-I. Convergent validity will be tested by examining whether TBO neural and
eyetracking indices converge with EMA indices of SM use, focusing on indicators of a social evaluation
orientation toward SM (e.g. social comparison orientation, fear of missing out, digital status-seeking). We
expect that these associations will be stronger for TBO compared to CHAT-I indices. We will also explore
whether ASN activity on the TBO Task interacts with SM experiences to predict symptoms of depression. The
task will be disseminated to facilitate future longitudinal and bidirectional studies of SM use, brain activity, and
emotional health, consistent with the goals of this RFA."

The overarching aim of this proposal is to test the efficacy and safety of a highly efficient and personalized
repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) method, termed Stanford Accelerated Intelligent
Neuromodulation Therapy (SAINT). In this proposal, we will utilize SAINT as a rapid-acting intervention for the
reduction of explicit and implicit suicidal cognition within the context of an emergency psychiatric admission for
suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Although rTMS is FDA approved for treatment-resistant depression (TRD),
the average required treatment application is 6 weeks before signs of symptomatic improvement, which is not
an optimal strategy for symptomatic treatment of an acute suicidal crisis. This application is motivated by three
recent findings in the neuromodulation field. First is a sham-controlled pilot study evaluating an accelerated
conventional rTMS protocol, where multiple stimulation sessions were safely delivered to the left dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC) across three days in patients with suicidal ideation. This study demonstrated that
conventional rTMS can be ‘accelerated’ as well as demonstrated a signal of reductions in explicit suicidal
cognition. Second, there are two notable randomized trials of intermittent theta-burst stimulation applied to the
L-DLPFC that demonstrated the efficacy of intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) as a treatment for TRD, a
condition commonly associated with suicidal cognition. iTBS has been demonstrated to have 5X the pulse
potency of conventional rTMS, which allows for a much-reduced stimulation session time in comparison to
traditional rTMS and therefore makes multiple treatments per day a feasible intervention. The final innovation is
that rTMS targeting utilizing resting state functional connectivity improves antidepressant outcomes of rTMS.
We designed an approach, which we termed SAINT, which utilizes numerous applications of iTBS per day, as
per principles of spaced learning theory (optimized intersession-intervals), within a functional connectivity
derived target (L-DLPFC-sgACC). In TRD, we have observed dramatic changes in mood and associated
explicit suicidal cognition using SAINT. We propose utilizing SAINT to modulate the neural circuitry that
underlies explicit and implicit suicidal cognition along with moderators/mediators (hopelessness, anhedonia,
and depression). We will conduct a randomized, controlled trial of SAINT applied to the L-DLPFC-sgACC to
assess efficacy of the approach in reducing suicidal cognition in hospitalized psychiatric inpatients."
11040762,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Dysregulated sleep and circadian disruption are common among adults in the United States. An estimated 30-50% of
adults endorse some form of sleep-related problem, such as short sleep duration (<6 hours/night), poor sleep quality,
presence of insomnia symptoms, or an early or late chronotype (i.e., preference for certain sleep and wake time) that is
at odds with the dominant societal social clock. These sleep problems are being increasingly implicated as significant
contributors to lower cardiovascular health (CVH) and thus subsequently higher cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity
and mortality. For example, short sleep duration, insomnia symptoms, and evening chronotype are associated with a
number of components to CVH, including obesity, diabetes, and lower diet quality. Consequently, these same sleep-
related factors are associated with a higher risk for new-onset CVD, including coronary heart disease and heart failure.
There are significant health disparities for sleep health, CVH, and CVD. Dysregulated sleep, poorer CVH, and higher CVD
morbidity and mortality are disproportionately distributed across populations, with individuals of non-white
racial/ethnic groups and those overly burdened by socio-, economic-, and environmental disadvantage faring the worst.
Despite these parallel problems among the same populations and the significant extant literature on the sleep-CVD
association, there is a dearth of research on potential ways in which sleep disparities contribute to CVH and CVD
disparities and how to simultaneously address both of these connected problems.
Therefore, the overall research-related goal of this two-year Diversity Supplement proposal is to address the current
need for research on the intersection of sleep and CVD disparities in diverse populations through the following aims: 1)
determine associations of sleep factors, chronotype, and chronotype-sleep timing alignment with left ventricular mass
index, 2) determine associations of sleep factors, chronotype, and chronotype-sleep timing alignment with potential
behavioral (physical activity, diet quality, alcohol use, smoking) and biological (cortisol) mechanisms, and 3) determine
whether these associations differ by individual- and geocoded, community-level social determinants of health. In parallel
to this research, the overall training-related goal of this Supplement is to support Dr. Brittanny Polanka, PhD in receiving
necessary mentorship and career development guidance to become an independent, extramurally-funded principal
investigator in the field of cardiovascular behavioral medicine. In collaboration with a mentorship team including the
expertise of Drs. S. Justin Thomas, Marwah Abdalla, and Mercedes Carnethon, an individualized career development
plan has been created to address mentee training gaps in measurement and processing of objective sleep and circadian
data, use of subclinical assessment markers derived from echocardiography, and methodological and statistical
approaches in sleep and CVD disparities research. Completion of the proposed research aims and training objectives will
serve as the foundation upon which Dr. Polanka will prepare a K career development application to further her career
trajectory towards independence."
11040776,"Project Summary of Parent Grant
Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a common, life threatening disease that affects
1/400-1/1000. ADPKD is caused by mutations in PKD1 and PKD2, which encode polycystin-1 and
polycystin-2 (PC1 and PC2). Remarkably, the function of the polycystins remains enigmatic almost 30
years after their cloning and 20 years after their discovery on renal primary cilia. Besides cilia, PC1 and
PC2 are also found in other subcellular locations including extracellular vesicles (EVs). Urinary EVs can
be used as biomarkers of renal disease including ADPKD. Whether these polycystin-carrying EVs are of
ciliary origin and what role EVs play in healthy and diseased kidneys remains unknown. In the model
organism C. elegans and mammals, the polycystins LOV-1/PC1 and PKD-2/PC2 are architecturally
similar, act in the same genetic pathway, function in a sensory capacity, localize to primary/sensory cilia,
and are shed in EVs, suggesting ancient conservation. We will use our established C. elegans model and
fluorescently labeled ciliary EV cargoes PC1 (LOV-1) and PC2 (PKD-2) to study ciliary EV shedding,
bioactivity, and targeting in living animals. Super resolution, real time imaging reveals that LOV-1 and
PKD-2 co-localize on ciliary EVs and that cilia shed polycystin-carrying EVs from two distinct sites - the
ciliary tip and the ciliary base. Ciliary tip EVs shedding is triggered by mechanical stimulation and functions
in animal-to-animal communication. For example, males deposit PKD-2-carrying EVs onto the vulva of the
hermaphrodite during mating. We also used PKD-2::GFP to enrich and profile the C. elegans EV
proteome, and, more specifically, the polycystin EV signalosome. We hypothesize that polycystin-carrying
EVs act as discrete signaling units and carry specific cargo for biogenesis, cargo sorting, signaling, and
targeting. In Aim 1, we will define the relationships between polycystins and the components of polycystin-
carrying EVs. In Aim 2, we will ascertain the function of polycystin-associated EV cargo and test the
hypotheses that the polycystins and associated proteins function as a signalosome in ciliary EVs and in
ciliated sensory neurons. This competing renewal application will uncover the fundamentals of ciliary EV
biology and the functions of the polycystins on cilia and EVs. Our studies will provide insight about the
biology of normal and pathological processes that require or are modulated by EVs including ciliopathies."
11034219,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) is a rare disease, affecting ~1,500 children and young
adults in the U.S. In severely affected patients, ARPKD can present in the neonatal period with massively
enlarged kidneys and pulmonary hypoplasia, but the clinical spectrum of ARPKD is highly variable. We now
recognize that just ~50% of patients present perinatally, and many present later in childhood or even adulthood.
ARPKD causes progressive chronic kidney disease leading to kidney failure, as well as congenital hepatic
fibrosis, which can lead to intrahepatic bile duct dilatation, periportal fibrosis, and portal hypertension. Despite
this high burden of morbidity, there are currently no FDA-approved disease-modifying therapies for ARPKD.
Several drugs appear promising in animal studies, but only one small Phase 1 clinical trial has been completed.
Barriers to conducting clinical trials in ARPKD include: (1) limited natural history data; (2) lack of defined clinical
outcomes to serve as trial endpoints; (3) lack of validated prognostic biomarkers to identify patients at highest
risk of progression; and (4) difficulty in recruiting sufficient numbers of patients who are eligible, able, and willing
to participate in trials. The overall objective of this proposal is to accelerate clinical trials for ARPKD by creating
PKDnet, a robust data resource to identify a research-ready cohort of children with ARPKD and efficiently collect
high quality, large-scale natural history data and identify suitable endpoints and prognostic biomarkers to inform
clinical trial design. Data will come from PEDSnet, a National Pediatric Learning Health System with >14 years
of electronic health record data for >13 million children at 11 U.S. academic pediatric centers. To inform future
trial design, we will also leverage the PEDSnet infrastructure to administer patient and family surveys to identify
priorities for patient-reported and clinical outcomes and understand factors affecting willingness to participate in
clinical trials. Once established, PKDnet will serve as a sustainable resource for ARPKD research that will allow
ongoing analysis of longitudinal natural history data, provide valuable data to inform future clinical trial design,
and facilitate future recruitment of patients into high-priority studies."

This supplementary award aims to provide extensive research training in neuroimmunology for a gap-year
researcher. The proposed project explores the complex landscape of age-associated neutrophil alterations in
the brain after cortical brain injuries and clarifies their unique contributions to neuroinflammation and cognitive
effects. This investigation focuses on understanding the role of aging-associated neutrophil subpopulations
post-injury within the thalamus, leveraging single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from our parental
R01 award. We aim to identify specific age-associated indicators within the brain using refined analysis
techniques and advanced clustering algorithms. Validation of the presence and activation status of these
markers in the injured brain will be pursued through immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry, providing
crucial insights into the nuanced age-specific neutrophil responses. We aim to elucidate the intricate interplay
between age-specific neutrophil subpopulations, their activation dynamics, and the evolving neuroinflammatory
and cognitive consequences following traumatic brain injury. We will also examine how neuroinflammation and
cognitive recovery after injuries are affected by age-associated neutrophil suppression. We will use methods
established in our parental R01, particularly antibody-based cell depletion, to assess the impact of age-
associated neutrophil infiltration on neuroinflammatory markers, microglial activation, and cognitive recovery
after injuries. These studies will be conducted in parallel to hands-on experiments and data analysis training,
which will enhance the researcher’s skills and prepare the researcher for graduate studies."

Recombination between chromosomes is required to generate genetic variation, maintain genome integrity,
and ensure proper chromosome segregation during meiosis, the specialized cell division program that
generates haploid gametes such as sperm and eggs. Perturbations in recombination can compromise these
basic cellular functions, ultimately leading to cancer, infertility, or birth defects. Meiotic recombination is
initiated by programmed double strand DNA breaks (DSBs), which are repaired using meiosis-specific
mechanisms that 1) favor utilization of the homologous chromosome (instead of the sister chromatid) as the
repair partner; and, 2) promote a crossover outcome of the DSB repair process, which is required for proper
chromosome segregation during meiosis. Although repair of DSBs with the appropriate template (homologous
chromosome) is necessary for proper chromosome segregation and genome integrity, our knowledge of how
germ cells achieve this critical template preference in the presence of nearly identical sequences (sister
chromatids) is limited due to assay limitations in metazoans. The goal of our research program is to
understand how chromosomes are able to access distinct recombination pathways and partners to ensure
faithful genome inheritance. Using in vivo assays we developed in the model system Caenorhabditis elegans,
we have directly detected and analyzed use of the sister chromatid as a repair template during metazoan
meiotic prophase I progression. Building upon our published work, we are defining and establishing how
specific chromosome structures, proteins, and cellular contexts regulate recombination pathway and repair
partner choices to maintain meiotic genome integrity. As articulated in the PEDP of the parent award, the PI is
firmly dedicated to mentoring and diversifying science with deliberate and purposeful efforts to promote
inclusive excellence within science within the planned research program. With this administrative supplement,
we will expand our mentoring and research studies in the parent award to define the factors that impact the
sexually dimorphic crossover recombination landscape, and to determine the role of actin polymerization in
DSB repair during meiotic prophase I. Overall, these studies will reveal how recombination pathway and
partner choices ensure that chromosomes form the connections necessary for chromosome segregation and
repair DSBs for maintaining genomic integrity during sperm and egg development."
11049005,"Background: Chronic insomnia, one of the most common health problems among Veterans increases risk for
medical and psychiatric disorders, higher rates of accidents and injuries, and functional impairment. The most
common forms of treatment are prescription sedative-hypnotic medications and cognitive behavioral therapy
for insomnia (CBT-I), a multi-component psychotherapy. Despite strong evidence in support for CBT-I as the
first line treatment, sedative-hypnotics remain the most common. Sedative-hypnotic use is linked to potential
tolerance, dependence, and abuse as well as risk for daytime fatigue and cognitive and physical impairment.
Furthermore, sedative-hypnotics treat symptoms while CBT-I focuses on the cognitive/behavioral causal
factors. Notably, deprescribing sedative-hypnotics, which may help to reduce associated risk and improve
Veteran function and quality of life, is often accompanied by the return or worsening of insomnia symptoms.
Thus, to improve Veteran sleep outcomes, deprescribing and CBT-I should occur simultaneously. Furthermore,
a telehealth-based intervention that combines CBT-I with deprescribing could result in improved Veteran sleep,
function, and quality of life while also increasing access to care in an efficient and scalable manner.
Significance/Impact: Both deprescribing and CBT-I are evidence-based interventions regularly delivered
within VA; however, a combined intervention that can streamline care and optimize Veteran outcomes is not
readily available. The Clinician Operated Assistive Sleep Technology (COAST) is an evidence-based, digital
sleep platform that combines aspects of in-person CBT-I (personalized care) with the benefits of telehealth (in
home care, flexible scheduling). COAST’s unique approach utilizes artificial intelligence to develop tailored
recommendations and integrates provider expertise and personalized deprescribing in an easy to use, efficient,
and scalable package. The proposed intervention has potential to significantly impact, and improve, Veteran
health and the delivery of sedative-hypnotic deprescribing and CBT-I in VA. This proposal is consistent with VA
RR&D’s scope to translate research into clinical practice in order to maximize Veterans’ functional
independence, quality of life, and participation in their lives and community.
Innovativeness: This pilot study is pragmatic and unique. There are currently no funded studies that combine
deprescribing and CBT-I, delivered by a scalable and efficient digital platform like COAST. Focusing on sleep
and functional outcomes will also ensure that this intervention can improve Veterans’ functional capabilities
and quality of life in addition to the reduction of clinical symptoms and improvement of care delivery.
Specific Aims: Aim 1 will assess the feasibility of recruiting Veterans with chronic sedative-hypnotic use and
their participation in a dual deprescribing and insomnia intervention, delivered through a digital health platform.
Aim 2 will assess Veterans’ acceptability and usability of the COAST platform. Aim 3 will assess change in
Veteran insomnia, sedative-hypnotic use, and clinical and functional outcomes pre- to post-intervention.
Methodology: This single-arm, 12-week intervention will recruit and enroll 50 Veterans with chronic sedative-
hypnotic medication use, a desire to reduce these medications, and ability to participate in a digital health
intervention. Feasibility will be based on recruitment and participation. Assessments of acceptability/usability,
and clinical and functional outcomes will occur at baseline, post-treatment, and 3-months post-treatment.
Next Steps: Findings will be used to inform the development of a larger, appropriately powered clinical trial to
test the effectiveness of COAST to deliver CBT-I and integrated pharmacist-led deprescribing to improve
Veteran sleep and function and reduced use of sedative-hypnotic medications. Also, next steps will include
efforts to better understand the factors that help or hinder Veterans’ use of digital interventions. Future
research efforts will involve VA operations partners (e.g., Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention,
Telehealth Services) and Veteran advisory groups to ensure the needs of Veterans and VA are met."

Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a severe mental illness with the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric disorder, with
suicide as the second leading cause of death. Despite extremely high rates of suicide, risk factors for suicidal
ideation (SI) and behaviors/attempts (SA) in this high-risk population are not well understood. While there is
evidence that threat reactivity, stress-response, over-arousal, emotion dysregulation, and agitation contribute
to suicide risk, the dynamic relations among these processes have not been characterized on a
comprehensive, momentary basis. Our scientific premise, developed from our past work, is that the application
of ideation-to-action and network theories will enable the identification of dynamic longitudinal interactions
among core dimensions (e.g., arousal, threat), AN symptoms, and SI/SA both between and within individuals.
Our study goals are to (1) identify symptom and dimension risk interactions of co-occurring AN and SI/SA
between and within persons, (2) differentiate which risk factors predict SI vs SA and (3) test if these risk factors
predict onset of SI/SA. These goals will ultimately identify which factors should be targeted in novel prevention
and treatment efforts. We will use a multiple units of analysis approach, combined with novel, cutting-edge
advances in suicide and network science. We will collect intensive real-time data on AN and suicide behaviors,
anxiety, over-arousal, emotion regulation, and agitation using mobile technology, as well as
psychophysiological assessment of emotion regulation (via heart-rate variability) and arousal (via
electrodermal activity characterizing over-arousal and acceleration characterizing the sleep-wake cycle), from
230 individuals with a diagnosis of AN/Atypical AN (AAN). At 1-month, 6-month, and one year follow-up we will
test if individual risk factors predict SI/SA. We expect 35-58 participants will have SA across our study period.
The purpose of this supplement is to provide staff support for our research operations and cover additional
costs for sensor bands to collect real-time objective physiological data during the 3-week period that
participants complete ecological momentary assessment data. This supplement will ensure that we reach our
recruitment milestones and collect physiological data in a timely fashion. In turn, this work will help to identify
risk factors for the overlap between eating disorders and suicide, which will lead directly to novel prevention
and treatment efforts."

The parent award (R01NR021156) focuses on the mental health trajectories of two groups of adult renters who
were threaten with eviction: (1) those who received an eviction filing and (2) those who were at-risk for eviction
but did not receive a court-ordered eviction filing. Household that receive an eviction filing are at risk for a hard
displacement. Households that are at-risk for an eviction but did not receive a court-ordered eviction filing are in
a tenuous housing status and feel a “pressure to move” to avoid hard displacement. Among households that feel
pressure to move, there are some that 1) move (i.e. soft displacement), while 2) others stay yet continue to feel
the pressure to move (i.e. potential displacement). These 2 groups of marginalized renters cannot be tracked
through the court systems, and less is known about them. Thus, an important supplement to the parent award's
efforts is to conduct a closer examination at tenants who felt the pressure to move and experienced soft or
potential displacement. The proposed supplement employs a mixed methods sequential explanatory design, just
like the parent award. For aim 1, the baseline and time 2 survey from the parent award will be used to examine
the direct and indirect associations between (soft vs. potential) displacement, economic hardship, psychosocial
stressors, and mental health. The goal of aim 2 will be to gain new data that will inform how and why the positive
associations in aim 1 exists, along with pinpoint barriers and facilitators not identified in survey through focus
group and photo elicitation interviews with a subset of tenants (n=40). The supplement also provides a wonderful
opportunity to concurrently provide training to first-generation early-career scholars to strengthen their research
skills. The PI, a first-generation Latina college graduate, has a strong track record of recruiting and mentoring
first-generation college graduates that includes being the PI of $1.2 million in training grants and opportunities.
Through this supplement, two trainees will engage in a series of online webinars and didactic courses to facilitate
content and methodological expertise, a professional development seminar, and applied research experiences
through the proposed research study. The trainees will also disseminate the findings associated with this
supplement through conference presentations, publications, and a photography exhibit. Last, trainees will
provide mentorship to first-generation undergraduate students. The short-term outcomes of the training program
include, but not limited, to trainees increasing their research self-efficacy and serving as role models to first-
generation undergraduate students. Building on the NINR-funded research occurring at the Cizik School of
Nursing (CSON), the long-term outcomes includes establishing CSON as having a strong training program
focused on the social and structural determinants of health across communities affected by homelessness and
displacement. The program's impact contributes to a more diverse workforce in behavioral research and an
increased accrual of health disparities research studies. These studies have the potential to improve housing
policies and social services designed to reduce displacement pressures and poor mental health."
11038051,"Low-value care (LVC), defined as care for which the likely degree of benefit is outweighed by harms or 
costs, is a critical domain of healthcare waste. Efforts to reduce LVC have intensified as literature has 
elucidated the magnitude of associated patient- and system-level harms. In the pediatric hospital setting 
(inclusive of inpatient and emergency departments (ED)), describing the impact of LVC has been identified 
as a research priority. LVC persists for many conditions commonly cared for in this environment despite 
increasing evidence of their ineffectiveness. While a growing body of literature describes the prevalence of 
pediatric hospital-based LVC, research on this topic in the United States (US) to date has focused largely 
on freestanding children’s hospitals, all of which are located in urban regions. Little is known about the 
prevalence and impact of pediatric LVC in rural hospitals, which provide the majority of hospital care for the 
one-in-five US children who reside in rural regions. This is particularly relevant because rural-residing 
children are under-represented in research and have poorer health outcomes and child mortality than their 
urban-residing peers. Additionally, the downstream implications of hospital-based LVC, including health 
outcomes and additional healthcare utilization, have not been well-characterized in children. Our research 
group previously utilized a framework endorsed by the National Quality Forum to develop the Pediatric 
Health Information System (PHIS) LVC Calculator, a tool measuring 30 low-value pediatric inpatient and 
ED services. The current proposal seeks to apply the content and methodology employed by the PHIS LVC 
Calculator to develop and implement a similar tool applicable to Medicaid data from eight states. Through 
application of this tool, we specifically aim to: 1) measure urban-rural disparities in pediatric hospital-based 
LVC delivery and determine if these disparities are moderated by hospital type and setting; 2) characterize 
downstream healthcare utilization (hospital revisits, imaging studies and prescription fills) and Medicaid 
spending associated with LVC delivery; and 3) using qualitative methods, identify deimplementation 
considerations in rural regions from the perspectives of rural hospital stakeholders."
11038053,"Individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who live in rural areas of the United States 
have worse health outcomes compared with their non-rural counterparts, outcomes not completely 
explained by higher rates of cigarette smoking. Both ongoing cigarette exposure and environmental 
exposures other than cigarettes, including particulate matter (PM) air pollution, are associated with worse 
COPD morbidity. Use of solid fuels (e.g. wood and pellet) for heating is common in rural areas and can 
generate high concentration of indoor PM. However, there is a common belief is that rural areas are free 
from air pollution, and rural residents are often not aware of pollution sources within their own homes and 
communities. There are few studies that assess environmental exposures, their association with COPD 
morbidity, and the risk perceptions of such exposures in rural areas of the United States. There is thus a 
critical need to examine prevalence, predictors, and perceptions of environmental exposures in rural areas 
in order to inform development of targeted, rural-relevant interventions designed to mitigate exposure. Our 
long-term goal is to identify potentially modifiable environmental risk factors that contribute to greater 
COPD morbidity in rural US, leading to future targeted interventions designed to improve outcomes. Our 
overall objective for this application is to determine the association of environmental exposures with 
respiratory morbidity in individuals with COPD living in rural areas, and to explore the risk perceptions of 
such exposures. Our central hypothesis is that rural COPD patients are at increased risk of adverse 
respiratory outcomes due to environmental characteristics both inside and outside of the home, exposures 
which are influenced by social and economic factors that are common in rural areas. The rationale for this 
project is that identifying the sources, health effects, and risk perceptions of environmental exposures will 
inform development of a future comprehensive intervention that is sensitive to the needs and priorities in a 
population where continued inhalational exposures are associated with disease progression and death. We 
will recruit 75 individuals with COPD living in northern New England (NNE), and comprehensive 
environmental exposure assessment will be paired with extensive clinical outcomes to address the 
following aims: 1) To identify individual and community characteristics that are associated with 
environmental exposures (e.g. solid fuel use, tobacco use, PM concentration) among those with COPD 
living in NNE; 2) To quantify the relationship between environmental exposures (e.g. solid fuel use, tobacco 
use, PM concentration) and morbidity in individuals with COPD living in NNE; and 3) To use semistructured 
interviews and focus groups to explore risk perceptions, knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors 
surrounding environmental risk factors and potential strategies to mitigate such exposures among 
individuals with COPD living in NNE. The proposed research will generate crucial information on the 
associations between environmental exposures and respiratory morbidity as well as the predictors of such 
exposures in NNE residents with COPD. Results from this study will lead to future trials designed to 
mitigate environmental exposures and improve health outcomes for individuals living with COPD in the 
rural US."
11043452,"Despite recent advances in neuroimaging, approximately 2/3 of intractable epilepsy patients that undergo
surgical evaluation continue to require intracranial EEG (IEEG), arguably the most invasive diagnostic test in
medicine. We currently lack methods to quantitatively map noninvasive imaging measures of structure and
function to IEEG. Specifically, there is a critical need to validate whole-brain noninvasive neuroimaging network-
based biomarkers to guide precise placement of electrodes and translate noninvasive network neuroimaging to
change the paradigms of clinical care. The long-term goal of this proposal is to predict IEEG functional dynamics
and surgical outcomes using noninvasive MRI-based measures of structure and function. Our overall objective,
which is the next step toward attaining our long-term goal, is to develop open-source noninvasive imaging tools
that map epileptic networks by integrating MRI and IEEG data. Our central hypothesis is that noninvasive
measures of structure and function relate to and can predict the intricate functional dynamics captured on IEEG.
The central hypothesis will be tested in patients undergoing IEEG targeting the temporal lobe network by
pursuing three specific aims: 1) To map the patient specific structural connectome to IEEG seizure onset and
propagation, 2) To correlate seizure onset and propagation on IEEG with network measures derived from resting
state functional MRI (rsfMRI), and 3) To integrate the structural (Aim 1) and functional (Aim 2) connectome with
standard qualitative clinical data to predict IEEG network dynamics and surgical outcomes. Under the first aim
patients will undergo diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) prior to stereotactic IEEG, an IEEG method that inherently
samples long range networks. The functional IEEG network will be mapped to DTI thus defining how seizures
are constrained by the underlying structural connectome as they propagate. Under the second aim patients with
temporal lobe epilepsy will undergo rsfMRI on 7T MRI prior to stereotactic IEEG. Functional network measures
from rsfMRI and IEEG will be coregistered and rsfMRI will be used to predict functional EEG ictal and interictal
networks. In the third aim two models predicting IEEG network dynamics and epilepsy surgical outcomes will be
created building off of methods developed in Aims 1 and 2. The proposed research is innovative because it
represents a substantive departure from the status quo by directly connecting noninvasive multimodal imaging
with measures of functional network dynamics in IEEG. The proposed research is significant because it is
expected that successful completion of these aims will yield personalized strategies for IEEG targeting based on
noninvasive neuroimaging."

This proposal will explore the role of structural racism and discrimination (SRD) in the Native American (NA)
chronic pain disparity. NAs experience higher rates of chronic pain than the general U.S. population and we
have shown that pain-free NAs are ~3x more likely than non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs) to prospectively develop
chronic pain. Our work over the past decade has identified several factors (discrimination, psychological stress,
somatic threat sensitivity, cardiometabolic allostatic load) that work collectively to promote a unique NA pain risk
phenotype we call “silent” spinal sensitization (sensitization of spinal pain neurons without sensitization of pain
experience). This discovery represents a paradigm shift in how NA pain risk is conceptualized because it is not
detectible by pain self-report. NAs have suffered generations of SRD due to colonization (eg, genocide, cultural
oppression), including forced removal from sacred lands and policies that lead to desecration of their
environment. The traditional NA worldview involves an intimate relationship with the environment in which all of
nature is interconnected. Within this worldview, environmental desecration is akin to desecration of the
body/soul. This proposal will demonstrate the impact of environmental SRD (racialized distribution of
environmental pollutions/hazards) on mechanisms of the NA pain disparity (Aim 1). The EPA's 11 environmental
(in)justice variables will be leveraged to form a societal-level latent variable representing Racialized
Environmental Desecration that will be linked to participants via geocoding. Our preliminary work shows this
variable: a) explains 87% of the variance in the original 11 variables, b) correlates with the proportion of NAs
within a census region suggesting it assesses racialized NA exposure to pollution, and c) promotes silent spinal
sensitization in NAs, but not NHWs. However, these pilot data must be replicated to address limitations. Our
study will model silent spinal sensitization using state-of-the art methods to assess central sensitization,
endogenous pain inhibition, and subjective pain experience. Physiological markers of spinal (nociceptive flexion
reflex) and supraspinal (pain-evoked cortical potentials) pain processing will be used to verify the level of the
neuraxis where sensitization occurs. Allostatic load will be comprehensively assessed from multiple systems,
including neuroendocrine and cardiovascular responses to psychosocial stress. To address the lack of research
on NA pain resiliency, we will determine if a NA-specific resource (ie, cultural connectedness) buffers against
SRD and its negative consequences (Aim2). Results will a) address an understudied health disparity in an
underserved population, b) help guide policy decisions to reduce the NA pain disparity, c) support a paradigm
shift in how NA pain risk is conceptualized, d) identify targetable mechanisms to inform a precision medicine
approach to prevent NA pain and disability, and e) identify resiliency factors to reduce the impact of SRD on NA
chronic pain risk mechanisms. This community engaged research involves input from NA community partners
(Indigenous Advisory Council, tribal IRBs) in the design, execution, and dissemination of the work."
11034310,"Pediatric intestinal failure (IF) is a rare condition that affects under 25,000 individuals in the United States.
Children with IF require parenteral nutrition to provide enough calories at a critical period of life, for growth and
development. IF is associated with high morbidity and mortality and transplant-free survival has been
estimated to be 70% at 5 years. IF can be classified into two broad categories. In short bowel syndrome (SBS-
IF), children have insufficient intestinal length to absorb enough nutrients for growth. The remaining functioning
intestine may adapt over time to accommodate this diminished length, but only half of these children reach
enteral autonomy, the state of no longer requiring any parenteral nutrition. To augment the adaptation process,
hormonal therapy has been tried. The lone approved hormonal therapy carries a high cost with only a small
fraction of children reaching enteral autonomy. The second category, functional IF, results from defects in either
absorption of nutrients into enterocytes or intestinal motility. No medical therapy exists to treat functional IF
disorders, resulting in lifelong parenteral nutrition dependence. The lack of adequate therapies in pediatric
IF results in large part due to the extreme rarity of this condition and the associated dearth of available
high-quality natural history data to be utilized in drug development and clinical trials. Moreover, study
endpoints have focused on freedom from parenteral nutrition and survival without consideration of quality of life
and additional meaningful disease specific outcome measures. This study will utilize the infrastructure of
the existing International Intestinal Failure Registry (IIFR) to overcome these gaps and support new
drug development in IF. The IIFR completed a successful pilot phase (N=204) in 2021 and currently
prospectively follows nearly 400 children with IF. Participating study sites account for 170 current patients with
an annual estimate of 183 new patients per year. In Aim 1, we will audit the ongoing prospective data collection
on demographics, clinical characteristics, nutrition, genotype, and outcomes in children with both SBS-IF (Aim
1a) and functional IF (Aim 1b) to verify data quality. In Aim 2, in collaboration with our stakeholder team, we will
incorporate a novel IF community-derived patient-reported outcome measure into the registry. In Aim 3, we will
utilize an IF community-derived set of core outcomes to develop a classification method for risk stratification
using machine learning methods. The result will be a longitudinal registry of high-quality patient data that
can be used to support therapeutic development with built-in tools to assess patient-reported
outcomes and risk stratify patients for future trials. In SBS-IF, this will provide the necessary standard of
care comparison for several products currently being evaluated. In functional IF, this will provide novel
genotype-phenotype correlation data to support the initial stages of drug discovery. In both SBS-IF and
functional IF, the longitudinal measurement of patient-reported outcomes in conjunction with disease specific
outcome measures will ensure that future therapeutics truly have a positive impact on patients’ lives."

 Chronic pain ranks among the top reasons for seeking medical attention. Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) has
been a traditional approach for managing chronic neuropathic pain in the back and legs. This method, however,
involves an invasive procedure that requires the patient to live with an implant. In contrast, Low-Intensity Focused
Ultrasound (LIFU) presents a non-invasive alternative explored in clinical trials for modifying central nervous
system activity, promising quicker neuromodulation for pain relief. Our research shows that a brief, three-minute
LIFU treatment targeting the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) can suppress pain responses in small and large animal
models for extended periods. Yet, targeting other crucial spinal areas for pain management, like the dorsal
columns, remains a challenge due to anatomical constraints.
 Building on the development of an advanced miniaturized Transcranial Stimulation (TMS) system, our project
aims to create a groundbreaking High Frequency (HF) Trans-Spinal Magnetic Stimulation (TSMS) tool. This new
system draws upon previous successes in dorsal column stimulation research and numerical simulations, setting
the stage for the first non-invasive dorsal spinal cord stimulation to address back pain. Utilizing a novel 10kHz
magnetic pulse, the HF-TSMS system mirrors the frequency used in invasive SCS treatments, which have been
effective in managing sciatica and significantly reducing opioid use among patients.
 We aim to refine HF-TSMS to target neural pathways involved in neuropathic back and leg pain. To achieve
this, we plan to conduct experimental studies using rodent models at Massachusetts General Hospital, assessing
pain responses via fMRI. Further efficacy and safety evaluations will be conducted in larger animal models at
the University of Arizona. Following these studies, we aim to secure an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE)
and initiate a preclinical pilot trial in humans suffering from neuropathic pain. The introduction of HF-TSMS as a
non-invasive, drug-free treatment option could significantly impact the management of chronic neuropathic pain,
offering new hope for patients with sciatica."
11043491,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Despite significant advances in cancer care, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains the third leading
cause of cancer death in the United States with a 5-year survival rate of ~10%. Obesity and high fat diet (HFD)
consumption increase PDAC risk in human cohorts and accelerate PDAC progression in mice, but the
mechanistic basis for these relationships is not well understood. Given the rapid rise in both the worldwide
prevalence of obesity and consumption of dietary fat, deciphering mechanisms of obesity-driven PDAC could
broadly impact human health. The translational relevance of prior diet research, however, has been limited by
uncontrolled variations in fat source and intake across human populations and mouse experiments. Therefore,
whether and how specific dietary fats promote pancreatic tumorigenesis remain critical unanswered questions
of great societal importance. Leveraging a unique isocaloric panel of HFDs differing only in fat source, we
identified a correlation between consumption of diets high in oleic acid – a monounsaturated fatty acid typically
associated with good health – and enhanced tumor development in a genetic model of PDAC that faithfully
mimics the genetic and histologic progression of the human disease. We further observed that tumorigenesis
correlated with increased incorporation of oleic acid into specific phospholipids in tissues, including the pancreas.
In this proposal, we aim to test the hypothesis that excess dietary oleic acid directly incorporates into cellular
lipids in the pancreas to drive PDAC development. The studies in Aim 1 utilize sophisticated genetic,
pharmacologic, and dietary approaches to modulate systemic oleic acid levels and establish whether excess
oleic acid is necessary and sufficient to promote pancreatic tumorigenesis. The proposed work in Aim 2 uses
lipidomic analyses to clarify the relationship between dietary fatty acids and pancreatic lipid composition during
PDAC progression and tests whether specific resultant unsaturated lysophospholipids drive tumorigenesis.
Finally, the experiments in Aim 3 combine metabolic and radioactive isotope tracer analyses with conditional
knockout models to decipher the mechanisms by which dietary oleic acid is directly taken up by the pancreas
and whether inhibition of fatty acid uptake pathways in pancreatic cells blocks the pro-tumorigenic effects of oleic
acid. Together, these studies will link fatty acid consumption to specific changes in pancreatic lipid composition
as driving forces in PDAC progression. Results from this work have transformative potential to identify novel
targeted dietary and pharmacologic strategies for the prevention of a largely incurable cancer."

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a genetically complex and heterogeneous set of diseases characterized by a
diverse set of mutations. Although many patients initially respond to treatment, many end up relapsing. Over the
last decade, an appreciation of the genetic diversity and clonal hierarchy in AML has opened the door to novel
therapeutic targets and therapeutic approaches to specific AML subtypes. Moreover, AML has been found to
bear unique metabolic features with therapeutic implications. Most importantly, mutations in the enzymes
isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1/2) have led to clinically approved drugs. However, many patients become
resistant to this therapy as well, further underscoring the need for new strategies to target dysregulated
metabolism in leukemia. Through the development of novel microcoil platforms to explore leukemia metabolism
with HP MR (Jeong et al. Science Advances 2017) we have identified a new metabolic vulnerability in the
glycolytic metabolism of leukemia (Jeong et al. Cell Metabolism 2021). This reliance on glycolytic metabolism
alters not only glucose flux to lactate, but also one-carbon flux through the serine pathway, which facilitates the
metabolism of glutamine. Moreover, we found that genetically targeting or pharmacologically inhibiting the
enzyme that mediates flux through this pathway (PHGDH) capitalizes on a new vulnerability in these cells.
Importantly, this targeting does not affect normal hematopoietic cell growth. Thus, building upon extensive
collaboration between our labs and ample preliminary data, we aim to employ innovative approaches to study
metabolism (Keshari Lab), including by developing non-invasive probes to measure changes in glycolysis and
oxidative stress with hyperpolarized magnetic resonance imaging. This metabolism will be characterized in well-
defined models of AML (Kharas Lab), with both genetic and pharmacological modulation, in order to develop a
strategy to assess leukemia-stem-cell-driven AML metabolism and the inhibition of serine metabolism.
Altogether, these studies will result in new mechanistic insights and novel cancer therapies."

Project Summary: Tissue necrosis is a form of cell death caused by a wide variety of diseases and injuries. Current methods of detecting tissue necrosis to guide surgical decision making are limited. In burn injury, clinical visualization of tissue necrosis is the standard of care; however, it is an imprecise method that can result in delays in care, unnecessary surgery, and removal of viable tissue. There is a critical need to identify novel methods to improve the detection of necrosis in burn injury to aid perioperative clinical decision making. While Indocyanine Green Angiography (ICGA) has been shown to identify burn depth using perfusion as a surrogate marker for necrosis, it has not been widely adopted for clinical decision making. Recently, clinical trials using delayed imaging of high dose ICG (Second Window Indocyanine Green - SWIG) have shown promise in image-guided surgical resection of tumors. We propose that combined imaging with ICGA and SWIG can be employed to enhance surgical decision-making in burn injury as well as in many disease processes involving necrosis. The knowledge gained from this project will fill the critical need to prevent unnecessary surgery, improve surgical precision, and provide insight into ICG localization in inflamed and necrotic tissue. The goal of this project is to characterize the ICGA and SWIG fluorescence in burn inflammation and necrosis on a macroscopic and microscopic level. Specific Aim 1 will characterize fluorescent signals from ICGA and SWIG in the healing potential of indeterminate depth burns in humans. Specific Aim 2 will evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of intraoperative fluorescence-guided surgical resection of necrotic tissue in humans. Specific Aim 3 will characterize ICG fluorescence quantification in inflamed, necrotic, and healthy tissues and determine substrate localization using cell culture and animal models. To attain our goal, we will use a team science approach including a burn surgeon scientist who has extensive experience in human thermal injury models and clinical expertise in the surgical care of burn patients along with imaging experts who have a track record for developing advanced fluorescence-based technologies for in vivo imaging, including a surgical imaging technology called “transient lighting” that allows simultaneous white light and low-level fluorescence visualization in ambient lighting conditions. Transient lighting is especially critical in burn surgery to augment the visualization of the wound with ICG fluorescence under full white lighting. This project will result in preclinical and clinical data testing the use of ICG for direct detection of necrotic tissue using a fluorescence imaging device optimized for burn surgery, while developing a platform for quantification of tissue necrosis and characterization of ICG-avid necrosis. These studies will provide necessary data to inform the design of a larger clinical trial to determine the efficacy and validity of ICG fluorescence-guided clinical decision making to improve outcomes for burn patients."

The development of a prophylactic vaccine for HIV would benefit from the generation of immunogens and vaccine delivery modalities that can induce a combination of highly functional CD8+ T cell responses towards mutation constrained epitopes and broadly neutralizing antibody responses to the HIV envelope trimer. Thus, in this proposal, we plan to leverage several components towards this goal: an approach known as structure-based network analysis that was used to identify a set of protective epitopes preferentially targeted by CD8+ T cell responses in spontaneous HIV controllers, 2) an envelope trimer that is capable of eliciting heterologous neutralizing antibody responses and 3) and a heterologous vaccine delivery platform of a replication-incompetent chimpanzee adenoviral (ChAd) vector and lipid-nanoparticle encapsulated messenger RNA (LNP-mRNA) that can elicit both robust CD8+ T cell and humoral immunity. Having applied structure-based network analysis to SIV protein structures, we have already identified a set of mutation-constrained (‘highly networked’) SIV epitopes restricted by an array of Mamu class I alleles. In addition, we have also produced compelling data demonstrating the ability of ChAd vector and LNP-mRNA to induce CD8+ T cell responses to highly networked SIV epitopes and strong trimer-specific antibody responses in rhesus macaques. What remains to be determined is whether functional CD8+ T cell responses towards highly networked SIV epitopes have a protective benefit against heterologous challenge, either individually or in tandem with antibodies. Thus, in Aim 1 of this proposal, we will assess the protective efficacy of heterologous ChAd and LNP-mRNA vaccines encoding highly networked SIV epitopes in a group of 20 rhesus macaques. These immunized macaques will be divided equally between those receiving mock immunization or highly networked SIV epitope immunization (10 per group). Following immunization, vaccine-induced CD8+ T cell responses directed against highly networked SIV epitopes will be assessed, and vaccinated animals will then be subjected to repeated low-dose SHIV.BG505 challenge. These SHIV-challenged macaques will have viral load, CD4 count, and CD8+ T cell phenotype assessments every 2 weeks during the challenge period and for 20 weeks following the challenge period as well. Go/No-Go criteria regarding T cell immunogenicity and the effects of vaccination on SHIV viral loads will be established and evaluated at the end of year 2. In Aim 2, we will assess the immunogenicity and efficacy of a combined ChAd highly networked SIV epitope immunogen and LNP-mRNA HIV Env trimer immunogen. These immunized macaques received either mock immunization, HIV Env trimer + mock immunization or both HIV Env Trimer and highly networked SIV epitope immunogens (10 per group). These studies will help determine whether vaccine-induced highly networked CD8+ T cell responses can provide a protective benefit either individually or in combination with antibody-based vaccination, within the heterologous ChAd and LNP-mRNA vaccine delivery platform."
11044366,"Project Summary: The primary goal of this R21/R33 Translational Aging Research Identification award
is develop, optimize, and validate a novel gene therapy-based treatment approach for refractory pain in
older individuals. Pain is a major socioeconomic problem, affecting more than 25% of adults in the US.
The lack of effective treatments for pain has fueled the opioid epidemic. In elderly patients, treatment
options are even more limited, on account of medical conditions that prevent specific drug use as well
as increased risks of side effects due to polypharmacy. Evidence from human genetics and mouse
models suggests that reducing firing in primary pain-sensing neurons, nociceptors, is sufficient to
abrogate pain. We first design new mechanisms for delivering to AAVs specifically to nociceptors. We
then develop novel approaches to decrease nociceptor firing, and we validate this reduction using
whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology in both primary mouse nociceptors and nociceptors derived
from human induced pluripotent stem cells. We validate pain models in aged animals, and obtain proof-
of-concept efficacy for the AAV-based treatment strategy using the pain models in aged animals. The
successful completion of the project sets the stage for continued preclinical development of AAV-based
therapy for refractory pain in older individuals."

Substantial theoretical work suggests that mental health disorders have their roots in early childhood
development, and that symptoms of psychopathology are in part the result of breakdowns in self-regulatory
skills that emerge early in life. Yet early predictors of emergent psychopathology, and/or trans-diagnostic
phenotypes such as self-regulation, are poorly understood. Utilizing prospective data from a large sample
(N=270) of mothers and their children, the current study aims to address this gap by: a) testing the hypothesis
that infant negative affect (NA) undermines children's emerging executive functioning (EF), and that NA-
associated deficits in EF are one mechanism through which early emotion-regulatory difficulties convey risk for
psychopathology at 3 years of age (Aim 1); b) examining whether prenatal stress moderates associations
among NA, EF, and psychopathology at age 3 (Aim 2); c) testing whether maternal immune activation during
pregnancy and/or child immune activation in infancy mediate the association between maternal prenatal stress
and child symptomatology (Aim 3). The results of this research will inform early identification and intervention.
The execution of this research plan, in conjunction with the training activities described, will provide the
applicant with the skills for an independent, innovative research program aimed at understanding the earliest
origins of psychopathology. The training plan assists in enriching her strong background in development with
more independence and more training in assessment and observation of psychopathology in childhood.
Additionally, it includes strong training in psychoneuroimmunology, including the role of the immune system in
psychopathology (in both the mother and child) as well as the mechanisms through which maternal immune
activation during pregnancy may influence child risk for psychopathology. Thetraining objectives include:a)
learning theory and methods related to the etiology, nosology, and pathogenesis of childhood
psychopathology, b) becoming acquainted with clinical assessment issues and diagnostic assignment as it
pertains to research application throughout childhood, c) translating her developmental expertise to clinical
populations including conceptualizing developmental findings in relation to psychopathology theory and
practice, d) gaining hands-on experience conducting research with clinical measures and clinically at risk
populations, e) learning theory and methods related to studying the immune system and inflammation-
psychopathology associations, f) better understanding the mechanisms through which maternal immune
activation during pregnancy may influence the developing brain and, by extension, child risk for
psychopathology, g) gaining hands-on experience collecting and analyzing relevant biological samples and
learning about contemporary molecular and immunological methods for analyzing inflammatory signaling
networks, and h) further training in the responsible conduct of research, including ethical considerations
specific to clinical populations, and in i) research writing and dissemination as it pertains to the field of

11045553,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Inflammation is a major driver of disorders such as temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis (TMJ-OA) has been
implicated in a significant cohort of patients with temporomandibular disorders (TMDs), a collective group of
conditions that can lead to debilitating pain, persistent headaches, and impaired range-of-motion. Recent clinical
and animal studies suggest that inflammation can perpetuate further TMJ harm, sprouting of sensory axons
innervating the joint, and altered excitability of sensory neurons resulting in the formation of chronic neuropathic
pain. Further, OA’s wide-ranging etiologies are further complicated by understudied sexually dimorphic
elements that increase the risk of joint degeneration and hypersensitivity to pain in women. Thus, there is an
urgent need for comprehensive evaluation of TMJ and innervating sensory neurons across sex in OA to
determine the mechanisms that underlie sensory and neuropathic OA pain, and the associated sexual
dimorphisms create significant barriers for developing targeted, mechanism-specific therapies for OA and OA
pain. To fill this knowledge gap, we propose a team science proposal that will take a multidisciplinary and
multi-omics approach. Taking advantage of the team’s complementary expertise in OA mouse models, single-
cell transcriptomics, and musculoskeletal biology (Lim; Co-PL#1) and neural tracers, single-cell spatial
proteomics, and neurobiology (Keeler; Co-PI#2), our objective is to use a multi-omic approach to identify novel
target cell populations and molecular mechanisms that drive sexually dimorphic TMJ-OA pathophysiology.
Ultimately, the imaging mass cytometry-based proteomic analysis of the sensory neurons that innervate joint-
associate tissues will enhance our understanding of how chronic exposure to inflammatory and degenerative
conditions, such as those observed in patients with osteoarthritis, impact the nature and functionality of joint-
innervation neurons. In addition, understanding which transcriptomic alterations translate into changes at the
protein-level will help us identify general and sex-specific therapeutic candidates to treat chronic joint pain.
Alignment with the Parent Project: These cutting-edge molecular profiling technologies are distinct, yet highly
complementary to the research aims proposed in the parent grant (P20GM139760; Delaware Center for
Musculoskeletal Research). Future plans: We are excited to have the opportunity to build collaboration among
two labs and obtain key pilot data. The completion of the supplement will lead to a larger co-PI R01 project that
will determine the molecular and cellular mechanisms that drive chronic and neuropathic pain in TMJ-OA. We
will leverage the resources and expertise through the parent COBRE and the existing INBRE at UD."
11045595,"Clinical reports suggest a link between noise-induced hearing loss and balance disorders in Veterans (Akin et
al., 2012), but the structural and physiological basis for this linkage is not well understood. Furthermore, animal
models which provide a mechanistic basis connecting noise-induced vestibular dysfunction and fall risk are
limited. The vestibular system plays a critical role in detection of head movements and orientation with respect
to gravity and is essential for normal postural control. Due to their anatomical proximity to the cochlea, the
otolith organs are exposed to sound pressure and are at risk for noise overstimulation, which may contribute to
vestibular dysfunction. Recent studies have linked noise overstimulation to decreased vestibular nerve activity
and loss of a specialized class of irregularly firing vestibular afferents which exhibit enhanced sensitivity to
acceleration (Stewart et al., 2018). It is likely that these afferents play an important role initiating postural
compensation for abrupt changes in head or body position due to their physiological characteristics and it has
been established that these afferents project to secondary vestibular neurons that project to the spinal cord
(e.g., Boyle et al., 1992). Although deficits in control of head and body posture may not be obvious during
sustained movements, deficits may become apparent when sudden perturbations require rapid resets of center
of gravity or head position in space. Such perturbations may naturally occur to avoid obstacles in one’s path or
regain postural stability after a slip, abrupt turn, or unexpected change in heading direction. The goal of this
proposal is to characterize fall risk in rodents with noise induced vestibular insults that preferentially impact
irregularly firing afferents, and to test the potential for restorative therapies that have been effective in cochlear
noise-induced injury models. Development of restorative therapies may hold significant clinical relevance for
Veterans, who often experience delayed effects of intense battlefield noise and may not seek treatment for an
extended period of time. Based on available evidence and our preliminary data, I propose that noise exposure
preferentially damages irregular vestibular afferents, resulting in reduced ability to react to abrupt perturbations
of the head in space.
The underlying hypothesis of the proposed studies is that noise will induce both immediate and long-term
vestibular dysfunction resulting in a balance disorder with components that can be “hidden” until challenged by
an abrupt motion which requires rapid compensation to maintain center of gravity. This will be tested in rats at
different times after exposure to noise. Changes in sensory cell synapses and vestibular nerve activity will be
correlated with fall risk in a balance beam task that measures postural stability and center of gravity. I then
predict that repairing the synapses by delivery of re-innervation inducing neurotrophic factor(s) (NTF) to the
inner ear will produce a functional recovery in balance and rehabilitation.
The first aim will follow the time course of noise-induced changes from both our previous noise exposure
condition and a military relevant small arms fire-like noise. I hypothesize that loss of sensory cell synaptic
connections and vestibular nerve activity will result in a balance disorder evidenced by slower crossing times,
altered crossing strategy, and increased falls on the balance beam, and that this dysfunction will persist over
time. The second aim will test a treatment that induces reconnection of lost synapses and I hypothesize that
the re-innervation will improve balance function and provide rehabilitation. Based on the literature suggesting
vestibular neurons persist well after ototoxicity induced de-innervation, I predict NTF treatment induced
reconnection and recovery will remain possible well after the noise induced de-innervation (corresponding to
many years in people) providing potential for rehabilitation in Veterans with noise-induced balance disorder."

Research Abstract
Background
Prostate, breast, and pancreatic cancers all have a disproportionately higher rate of aggressive tumor
grade and early onset in Black patients, with recent spikes of high incidence in West African nations
compared to other African regions. The genetic background correlations implicate predispositions.
Members of our SAMBAI team of investigators have pioneered genomics in cancer disparities research,
and over the past two decades, we have uncovered compelling evidence of distinct immunological
mechanisms associated with genetic ancestry. Our SAMBAI team members have developed methods to
quantify environmental exposures and interrogate the lived experiences of marginalized populations,
including epigenetic responses to racism.
Aims
We will partner with scientists across the US, Africa, and the UK to build an unprecedented resource, the
SAMBAI Biobank and Data Repository for Cancer Equity Research. We will generate a comprehensive,
accurate, and relevant measurement of social, environmental, genetic, and immunological factors to
complete an integrated set of analyses to define the causal vs. modifier relationships of disparate
outcomes in diverse underserved populations. We will establish a sustainable framework for team science
approaches with under-represented partners and establish best practices for coordinating cancer equity
research on a global scale.
Methods
We propose to utilize multiple methods across our different work packages. Social Determinants include
self-reporting surveys and database abstractions. Exposomes utilize mass spectrometry of plasma.
Genomics will utilize three sequencing methods on germline and tumor tissue, including long read,
short/deep, and ultra-low pass whole genome sequencing. Lastly, immunological profiles will be
measured with spatial transcriptomics and circulating multiplex immunoassays. These data require novel
computational frameworks, including cloud-based virtualization and the use of machine learning
technologies to identify novel associations across the strata of social to spatial data elements and across
our diverse geographic and ancestral SAMBAI cohorts.
Utility and Impact
We will improve research capacity in under-resourced environments for large-scale cancer research and
equitable access to data with equitable feasibility to improve treatment and outcomes. We will define
interactions of environmental exposures, social determinants, and genetic ancestry that determine
immunological landscapes of primary tumors and/or circulating immunological profiles in patients of
African descent. Our project will contribute a data repository with 100K features/patient, for 40,000
patients. The impact on this population includes a novel trial design, in collaboration with our patient
advocacy partners, to ensure that the specific genomic and immunological features we uncover become
part of targeted precision oncology theragnostic options."

unique or specialized model for research on many human diseases and developmental processes, as well as
for comparative biology and comparative genomics purposes. The PI maintains by far the largest breeding and
research colony of this species in the world. The most critical barrier to fulfilling the research potential of the
laboratory opossum is the lack of success of anyone in the US in establishing gene-editing procedures for this
species. A Japanese group recently overcame the technological impediments to gene editing of this species,
and succeeded in knocking out the tyrosinase (Tyr) gene in random-bred opossums. The implementation and
optimization of their methods at the PI’s laboratory will pave the way for achieving the long-term objective,
which is to establish a national research resource that will efficiently and economically create gene-
edited opossums required by US investigators to address important biomedical questions that this
laboratory animal is uniquely suited to address. While the volume of research with this species at any single
institution cannot justify the cost of establishing a large colony and gene editing technologies, a centralized
resource will be capable of serving all of the national needs at minimal cost. The specific aims are 1) to
establish expertise and proof-of-principle in our laboratory by targeted disruption of Tyr in a fully inbred
strain of laboratory opossums, and 2) to conduct targeted disruption of the phosphatase and tensin
homolog gene (Pten) in opossums of the same inbred strain. Knockout opossums will be created by applying
CRISPR-Cas9 technology to opossum embryos collected 30 - 34 hours after copulation, after which the egg
shell becomes too hard to penetrate. Penetration will be enhanced via the use of a piezoelectric actuator.
Confirmation of knockout genotype will be established by genomic DNA analysis of progeny weaned from the
treated embryos, and from subsequent generations of animals produced from those progeny. Pten -/-
homozygotes are expected to embryonic lethal, but heterozygotes are expected to serve as new model
in comparative medicine research on Autism Spectrum Disorder. We plan to establish a research project
on that topic beyond the 2-year project period, after a sufficient number of +/- animals have been produced.
Some examples of other research programs that will be made possible or highly enhanced by the creation of
specific knockouts are provided in the letters of support from investigators who are eager to collaborate.
Examples include the use of Pten +/- opossums in conjunction with Pten knockout opossum iPSCs (+/- and -/-)
from the same inbred strain for comparative research on in vivo and ex vivo neurodevelopmental processes
(Whitworth), the use of Pten +/- opossums to investigate mechanisms involved in auditory function and
regeneration (Walters), identification of genes that confer remarkable resistance of opossums to snake venom
(Sanchez), and function of T cell subsets, of which marsupials have one that is not found in eutherians (Miller)."
11046195,"SAMBAI: Societal, Ancestry, Molecular and Biological Analyses of Inequalities
Research Abstract
Background
Prostate, breast, and pancreatic cancers all have a disproportionately higher rate of aggressive
tumor grade and early onset in Black patients, with recent spikes of high incidence in West African
nations compared to other African regions. The genetic background correlations implicate
predispositions. Members of our SAMBAI team of investigators have pioneered genomics in
cancer disparities research, and over the past two decades, we have uncovered compelling
evidence of distinct immunological mechanisms associated with genetic ancestry. Our SAMBAI
team members have developed methods to quantify environmental exposures and interrogate the
lived experiences of marginalized populations, including epigenetic responses to racism.
Aims
We will partner with scientists across the US, Africa, and the UK to build an unprecedented
resource, the SAMBAI Biobank and Data Repository for Cancer Equity Research. We will
generate a comprehensive, accurate, and relevant measurement of social, environmental,
genetic, and immunological factors to complete an integrated set of analyses to define the causal
vs. modifier relationships of disparate outcomes in diverse underserved populations. We will
establish a sustainable framework for team science approaches with under-represented partners
and establish best practices for coordinating cancer equity research on a global scale.
Methods
We propose to utilize multiple methods across our different work packages. Social Determinants
include self-reporting surveys and database abstractions. Exposomes utilize mass spectrometry
of plasma. Genomics will utilize three sequencing methods on germline and tumor tissue,
including long read, short/deep, and ultra-low pass whole genome sequencing. Lastly,
immunological profiles will be measured with spatial transcriptomics and circulating multiplex
immunoassays. These data require novel computational frameworks, including cloud-based
virtualization and the use of machine learning technologies to identify novel associations across
the strata of social to spatial data elements and across our diverse geographic and ancestral
SAMBAI cohorts.
Utility and Impact
We will improve research capacity in under-resourced environments for large-scale cancer
research and equitable access to data with equitable feasibility to improve treatment and
outcomes. We will define interactions of environmental exposures, social determinants, and
genetic ancestry that determine immunological landscapes of primary tumors and/or circulating
immunological profiles in patients of African descent. Our project will contribute a data repository
with 100K features/patient, for 40,000 patients. The impact on this population includes a novel
trial design, in collaboration with our patient advocacy partners, to ensure that the specific
genomic and immunological features we uncover become part of targeted precision oncology
theragnostic options."
11035524,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 An unprecedented number of new policies across the US threaten the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual,
and transgender (LGBT) populations. In 2023, >500 discriminatory LGBT bills were introduced in state legisla-
tures—four-times more than in recent years. Such bills include those banning access to healthcare for trans-
gender individuals and those criminalizing teachers for discussing the existence of LGBT people. Emerging
data reveal that 70% of LGBT people report discriminatory bills adversely impact their mental health, even
when the bills do not become law. Before this rapid increase in discriminatory policies, LGBT people were dis-
proportionally burdened by adverse health outcomes, particularly mental health outcomes. The growing threat
and enactment of discriminatory LGBT policies will likely widen these disparities. However, little is known about
how the recent onslaught of discriminatory LGBT bills collectively influences mental health, particularly in ado-
lescence and young adulthood when mental health problems typically onset and when health service use tra-
jectories are often established. Without this time-sensitive research, we cannot evaluate the impact of real-
world policy environments and address the potential health effects of these discriminatory policies. Informed by
the Minority Stress Model, the proposed project's objective is to elucidate how mental health during the critical
years of late adolescence and early adulthood (ages 18–24 years) is influenced by four types of LGBT-target-
ed policies: 1) religious exemptions, 2) gender-affirming healthcare bans, 3) LGBT-restrictive school curricula,
and 4) LGBT-supportive school curricula. To substantiate the link between policies and mental health, we will
use a multi-method approach. In the R61 phase, we will collect time-sensitive survey data in the national
Healthy Minds Study—the largest ongoing survey of mental health in US colleges and universities—to quantify
associations among these policies, enacted stigma (e.g., discrimination, bullying, harassment), and mental
health among young adult college students (predicted N=80,850 students at 105 institutions, including four-
year schools, community colleges, and minority-serving institutions). In the R33 phase, we will use our newly
collected Healthy Minds Study data to identify individuals directly impacted by these policies, with whom we will
conduct in-depth qualitative interviews (n=120). To understand the population-level impact of these policies
and their mechanisms, we will then use nationally representative data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveil-
lance System (BRFSS, N=89,493 young adults) to evaluate the impact of LGBT-targeted policies. We will lev-
erage quasi-experimental methods (i.e., difference-in-differences analyses) to quantify the causal effect of
LGBT-targeted policies as well as causal mediation analyses informed by multi-method results from Aims 1
and 2. This project will produce robust and time-sensitive new evidence of how discriminatory and supportive
LGBT policies affect mental health. This work will have a positive impact by informing healthcare providers,
school leaders, and policymakers about the necessary actions to reduce entrenched mental health disparities."
10877663,"Project Summary/Abstract
Pennsylvania is the 5th largest state in the United States and has more than 6.1 million workers in a wide
range of industries such as education and health services, manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade, leisure
and hospitality, and mining and construction. As of 2018, Pennsylvania had 135,400 cases of nonfatal work-
related injuries and illnesses, the 4th highest number among the 41 states participating in the Bureau of Labor
Statistics (BLS) Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses (SOII). Occupational blood lead poisoning has
been a major concern in Pennsylvania and case counts rank among the highest in the nation. A
comprehensive, state-wide occupational health surveillance program needed to address the burden of work-
related morbidity and mortality is non-existent in Pennsylvania. As part of its mission to promote healthy
behaviors and prevent injury and disease among its residents, the Pennsylvania Department of Health (PA DOH)
proposes to establish a fundamental Occupational Safety and Health Surveillance (PennOSHS) program. The
program seeks to build sustainable public health infrastructure in Pennsylvania to reduce occupational
morbidity and mortality and eliminate occupational health disparities that contribute to overall health disparities.
PennOSHS aims to (1) collect, compile, and analyze occupational health data to identify areas that require
targeted actions by public health practitioners and other stakeholders and (2) disseminate relevant information
to these stakeholders to improve health outcomes. Specifically, PennOSHS will develop, analyze and interpret
the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)/Council of State and Territorial
Epidemiologists (CSTE) occupational health indicators (OHI), including the statewide employment profile;
improve data collection for occupational lead exposure, analyze and interpret the resulting data; promote the
importance of collecting work-related variables, such as industry and occupation (I/O); and identify potentially
new sources of data to support total worker health in Pennsylvania. PennOSHS will also develop education
and training materials and other outreach efforts based on the analysis of OHIs to prevent/minimize
occupationally linked morbidity and mortality especially those related to occupational lead exposure. These
efforts will be supported by developing partnerships with a diverse group of occupational safety and health
stakeholders (academic, governmental and community entities) and establishment of an advisory committee
which will guide and monitor program implementation and progress."

program that leverages longitudinal data, from both observational and interventional studies, to examine how
demographic and economic factors facilitate or suppress individual healthy aging behaviors (HABs) and, in turn
influence outcomes among older adults over the life course. Spanning five divisions and schools and
partnering with the National Opinion Research Center (NORC), CHABLIS will bring many areas of expertise

future data-focused studies of aging, and share those findings immediately. The emphasis in that Core, and
throughout our proposal, is that longitudinal data collection efforts are central to research on aging, whether
they be local (e.g., CCP) or national (e.g., NSHAP); data collection processes must be continually advanced to
ensure that these data are relevant and used. Our Administrative and Research Support Core lays out our

11039039,"SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Leveraging our deep experience with conducting community-engaged research, the goal of the Building Access
to Food through Systems and Solidarity (BASIS) Study is to improve diet by providing culturally appropriate food
access and attending to drivers that limit the ability to achieve nutrition securit y in Sunset Park – a community of
Mexican and Chinese American families in Brooklyn, NY that has been hard-hit during the COVID-19 pandemic,
has lagged in economic recovery, and where residents are disconnected from government supports.
Significance. Latinx and Asian American communities face unique, yet similar structural and social inequities
contributing to poor diet quality, which have contributed to the increased burden of diabetes and non -alcoholic
fatty liver disease in these groups. The past two years has exacerbated these barriers due to overt anti-immigrant
and anti-Asian sentiment during the pandemic, invoking fear, cultural shame, and loss of a sense of security for
these groups – factors which have fueled challenges towards accessing food and economic stability.
Approach. Working collaboratively with four farming/gardening organizations, one elementary school and three
community-based organizations, our aims are:
Aim 1: To implement a whole-of-community intervention in Sunset Park for improving diet and the social/built
environments for low-income Mexican and Chinese American immigrants. The BASIS program will include in-
language navigation for food business owners/residents to government assistanc e / workforce development
programs; a subsidized fresh produce box program; gardening and nutrition education; and a social marketing
campaign to promote healthy eating behavior changes and cultural awareness. Materials will be culturally
appropriate and specific to each community, yet also highlight similarities across both groups .
Aim 2: To evaluate the BASIS program impact at the community, interpersonal and individual levels . The
evaluation plan will employ administrative data sources and mixed methods to assess outcomes at multiple
levels. Outcomes will be assessed in Sunset Park and in 4 comparison communities that are predominantly
Mexican and Chinese American (Corona, East Harlem; Chinatown, Elmhurst, respectively). We hypothesize that
stability in the food retail sector and improvements in neighborhood social cohesion, diet, ethnic pride and sense
of belonging will be observed in Sunset Park vs. comparison communities.
Aim 3: To co-develop a multi-faceted sustainability strategy with multi-sector stakeholders. Sustainability is a
central priority of the BASIS program and is driven by commitment to community priorities; investment in
infrastructure and workforce development; and engagement in the local food policy dialogue.
Impact. BASIS presents a powerful model to improve diet in immigrant communities by addressing determinants
of food access in a community-centered, culturally competent way, and by fortifying community empowerment."
11035309,"Heart failure (HF) is the fastest-growing cardiovascular disorder and a leading cause of urgent healthcare
utilization in the U.S. Effective HF physical self-care (i.e. behaviors that maintain physiologic stability (self-care
maintenance), monitor for changes in signs and symptoms (self-care monitoring), and respond to symptoms
when they occur (self-care management)) has been linked with better patient-reported, biological and clinical
outcomes. However relatively little is known about mental health self-care in HF. In addition, a growing body of
research includes informal care partners (e.g. family members who engage in an unpaid shared partnership in
care) increasing the need for a critical examination of the differential impact of physical and mental health of both
care partners on HF management; but, this is an emerging area of science. As managing HF at home has
increased in intensity/complexity, the mental health impact is of growing importance. Similarly, there are well-
known inequities and major advocacy calls to study social determinants of health in HF (i.e. race, ethnicity,
gender, economic resources, education, occupation and discrimination). Before we can intervene effectively,
however, we need to learn more from people with HF and their care partners about what they do to manage HF,
and how they maintain, monitor and manage their mental health. The proposed study addresses identified gaps
in both precision (mental health) and population (social determinants) health sciences. Accordingly, the goals of
this prospective, dyadic- and social determinants of health theory-informed study of 100 dyads are to gain insight
into the role that social determinants of health play as the root causes of some of the inequities about which we
know, and additional inequities we are likely to discover in this study. Specifically, we will quantify the
relationships between both symptoms and social determinants of health and contributions to care in people with
HF and their care partners (Aim 1), and then characterize people with HF and care partner contributions to the
maintenance, monitoring and management of mental health (Aim 2). Importantly, each aim is strongly rooted
with hypotheses of social determinants of health or preliminary data that suggest we will be successful in
achieving these aims. The results of this study will have an important and enduring influence on future theoretical
modification (embedding the dyad and mental health in “self”-care theory), measurement (centering the dyad),
and interventional development to promote optimal physical and mental health among HF dyads. Our long-term
goal is greater parity between physical and mental health in theoretical, measurement, and interventional
domains of HF management."
11034811,"Project Abstract
End-stage heart failure is a leading cause of death worldwide and costs the United States over $30 billion
annually. Heart transplant remains the only curative therapy but its success is threatened when the donor
heart does not work properly. Current immunosuppressive treatments focus on targeting immune cells in the
recipient's heart. These therapies confer a significant risk of infections and malignancy and are only modestly
effective. Targeting the donor-recipient interaction may provide a novel therapeutic pathway.
Several distinct immune cell types reside within the donor heart with macrophages comprising the majority of
myeloid cells. The mouse and human heart contain at least two populations of macrophages that can be
distinguished based on the expression of C-C chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2). CCR2+ macrophages participate
in inflammatory responses whereas CCR2- macrophages promote tissue repair. The PI has established that
donor CCR2- and donor CCR2+ macrophages have opposing roles after heart transplant. Depletion of donor
CCR2- macrophages accelerates rejection while depletion of donor CCR2+ macrophages prolong allograft
survival. In this proposal, the PI will decipher the mechanisms by which donor CCR2- macrophages
prevent rejection through their modulation of other immune cell populations and signaling pathways.
The scientific goals of this research award are to identify novel immune populations that can be exploited
to understand the mechanisms of rejection and can be therapeutically targeted to improve outcomes.
By the end of the award period, the PI will understand how donor CCR2- macrophages effect donor CCR2+
macrophage activation and whether this activation is necessary for allograft rejection (SA1). The PI will
investigate how CCR2- macrophages become activated and whether this activation is required for allograft
protection (SA2). In completing these aims, the PI will gain technical expertise in flow cytometry, intravital
imaging, bulk and single cell RNA sequencing, antigen presentation, phagocytosis, and alloreactivity assays.
The career development goal of this proposal is to develop the PI into an independent physician-scientist in the
field of cardiovascular research. The PI has previously obtained a PhD training in biology and has obtained
additional training in basic and translational cardiovascular research during his post-doctoral fellowship. The PI
has completed clinical training in Internal Medicine, Clinical Cardiology, and Advanced Heart Failure and
Cardiac Transplantation Fellowship. The proposed 5-year career development plan will provide the PI with
formal training in immunology and bioinformatics and ongoing laboratory training in the study of cardiac
transplantation and macrophage biology. The PI will meet regularly with his mentors and advisory committee
which is composed of senior scientists who are experts in immunology, transplantation, cellular imaging,
bioinformatics, and career development. At the conclusion of this award period, the PI will have acquired the
skills necessary to become an independent and successful physician-scientist."

The Innovative Mentoring and Professional Advancement through Cultural Training (IMPACT) program is a
multi-dimensional, inter-institutional, collaborative mentoring program for students who identify with historically
underrepresented groups and who are interested in communication sciences and disorders (CSD). This
program is a collaboration between Case Western Reserve University, a top US research university, and
Hampton University, a top-ranked Historically Black College and University (HBCU). Currently, the program
supports 21 undergraduate students in CSD and clinical speech-language pathology graduate students. This
supplement has two aims. The first is to further enhance the students’ self-sufficiency and prospects for
success by adding group and individual coaching sessions that foster the development of robust professional
identities and life skills (including time management, organization, and stress management). This supplement
will support a carefully structured approach to cultivating these identities and skills in our current target
population. The second aim is to enhance the knowledge, self-efficacy, and sense of belonging of
underrepresented Doctor of Audiology (AuD) students. Because AuD programs tend to be small (an average of
10 students), underrepresented AuD students often find themselves in cohorts where none of their peers share
their background. Through this supplement, AuD students will have access to the entire IMPACT curriculum
and will participate in clinical case discussions, grand rounds, and journal groups, activities that will help build a
sense of community and social belonging. They will also have the opportunity to practice and enrich their
academic skills. Both coaching and mentoring will be delivered by program faculty who identify with historically
underrepresented groups. The supplement will enable us to assess the benefits of coaching paired with our
robust mentoring program for the students we currently serve as well as the effectiveness of our expanded
model for an online cohort of AuD students."

The UNC CFAR, a consortium comprising UNC Chapel Hill, Research Triangle Institute (RTI)
and Family Health International (FHI), has actively partnered with the North Carolina (NC)
Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) since its inception 27 years ago. CFAR
outreach has focused primarily on four NC HBCUs (Winston-Salem State University [WSSU],
NC A & T State University [NC A&T], NC Central University [NCCU], St. Augustine University
[SAU]). Our outreach is based on the basic tenet that to achieve equity in HIV research and
care we must ensure greater representation of communities of color in the relevant scientific
and medical disciplines.
Engagement of these HBCUs has been multilayered and includes: providing developmental
awards to HBCU faculty; facilitating HBCU and underrepresented community engagement at
the regional and national level by sponsoring attendance at national meetings; funding and
conducting workshops in research writing for HBCU faculty; offering access to academic
journals at the UNC library system by making HBCU faculty UNC affiliates.
In 2021, with funding made available from the initial CFAR Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
Pipeline Initiative we established the NC Program for Inclusive Excellence (NC PIE), a yearlong
paid internship for graduate and undergraduate students with two partner HBCUs-NCA&T and
NCCU. NC-PIE, refunded in 2022 and 2023, has enrolled 10 interns to-date, six of whom have
completed the internship. Of these six interns, three intend to apply to medical school, one to a
physician associate program, one to a masters of public health program and one is completing
her doctoral program and working at UNC for the NC Translational and Clinical Sciences
Institute.
In this application we propose to 1) Continue with NC-PIE and increase number of interns from
3 to 4. 2) Add a new immersive on-campus 10 week summer research program by partnering
with the UNC Department of Microbiology and Immunology 3) Introduce NCCU undergraduate
students to infectious diseases specifically HIV by developing and implementing a six part
lecture series as part of the Public Health curriculum."

 Over the past two decades, the UNC CFAR Administrative Core has developed and
maintained synergistic partnerships with faculty and students at local Historically Black College
and Universities (HBCUs) in North Carolina. This engagement is based on two fundamental
beliefs: (1) faculty at HBCUs have unique and important contributions to make in understanding
the HIV epidemic, and (2) providing formative experiences in research for students at HBCUs is
an important contribution to the next generation of investigators. Building upon these principles,
we have collaborated with North Carolina Central University (NCCU) and North Carolina Agricultural
and Technical State University (NC A&T) through internship programs, development awards, and
administrative supplements.
With initial funding (2021-22) from the CFAR Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Pipeline Initiative
(CDEIPI), coordinated by the DC CFAR we created the North Carolina Pathway for Inclusive
Excellence (NC-PIE) in collaboration with NCCU and NC A&T. NC-PIE is a sustainable, yearlong
graduate and undergraduate student pathway program designed to enhance inclusion in the
biomedical sciences. This funding was successfully renewed through CFAR Administrative
supplements for 2022-23 and 2023-24.
In this application we build on lessons learned to further optimize the NC-PIE student experience
and provide additional opportunities for exposure. In addition, we have created two new
opportunities: 1) we will partner with UNC Dept. of Microbiology and Immunology to enhance an
immersive summer research experience the HBCU Bridge Summer Research Opportunity
Program (HBCU-Bridge-SROP) and 2) we will develop a new undergraduate lecture series
“Principles of HIV” that will be offered as part of the Public Health education curriculum at
NCCU.
This revision application housed within the Administrative core, will afford novel professional
learning experiences, catalyze partnerships to create new research, training and mentoring
opportunities and advance knowledge of infectious diseases especially HIV and allied health
careers. CFAR Administrative infrastructure is in place to support the aims of this revision
application."

Liver Center consists of four Core Facilities: 1) An Administrative Core; 2) A Cellular and Molecular Physiology
Core; 3) A Morphology Core and 4) A Clinical-Translational Core. The research base focuses on three major
basic/translational themes: (1) Hepatic metabolism, (2) Immunobiology and inflammation, and (3) Epithelial
biology/pathobiology. The research programs range from fundamental studies of liver biology to translational
studies of immediate clinical relevance. Major areas of liver disease examined within these themes include
autoimmune diseases, cholestasis, fibrosis/cirrhosis, genetic diseases, infections, liver cancer, and
MASLD/AALD. The major goals of the Center are: (1) to stimulate multidisciplinary interactions between basic
and clinical faculty and departments, (2) to provide an in-depth training environment, (3) to efficiently organize
time consuming, often costly techniques and procedures in Core Facilities for use by multiple investigators, (4)
to stimulate basic scientists to direct their focus to areas of interest to the Center, (5) to stimulate translational
research from bench to bedside, (6) to promote new research and training opportunities with a pilot feasibility

outside the institution through its enrichment program. As part of the Center’s enrichment program, we plan to
host a scientific symposium for early-stage investigators pursuing digestive disease research concurrently with
hosting the 2024 Annual DDRCC meeting. This program format will be like recent past meetings, including Univ.
Penn (2018), UCSF (2020), MUSC (2022), and most recently Cincinnati (2023). Because the DDRCC program
is dedicated to fostering the growth of early-stage investigators, these scientists will be a targeted audience of
the symposium. Thirty-two early career scientists (two from each of the other 16 DDRCCs) will be subsidized to
attend the event and participate by presenting their liver/digestive disease work as either an oral or poster
presentation. Six investigators or approximately 20% will be selected based on their submitted abstracts to
present their work as an oral presentation. The symposium will include opportunities for career development,
mentoring and networking opportunities for the early-stage investigators. The DDRCC meeting also will focus on
fostering collaborations among centers, sharing best practices for leading a successful center, and enhancing
diversity and inclusion. All attendees will have an opportunity to learn about the cutting-edge liver/digestive
disease scientific programs and research core technology services that are available at the Yale DDRCC as well
as the other 16 centers. We are requesting an administrative supplement to project number P30 DK034989 to
organize and host the meeting/symposium. Funds will be used to secure a venue, organize the meeting and
offset travel expenses for invited speakers and early-stage investigators."
11034805,"Project Summary
Somatic mosaicism results from the accumulation of mutations over time, leading to a unique genotype in every
cell. These mutations can be as small as a single base pair or as large as an entire chromosome – affecting
hundreds or even thousands of genes. Mosaic chromosomal alterations (mCA) are one type of somatic
mosaicism characterized by large chromosomal gains or losses and are associated with aging, heart disease,
kidney disease and cancer. The role of mCA has been best characterized in blood, but recently we used single-
cell sequencing to show that mCA are also common in the kidney and are associated with disease progression.
Kidney and blood are hotspots for mCA, but these data raise the possibility that mCA are present in other organs
where they exert tissue-specific effects. Existing algorithms for mCA detection are tailored to cancer and rely on
the assumption that cancer cells are clonal and carry the same variants. This is a significant limitation because
mCA in non-neoplastic tissue are not clonal and may only be present in a small fraction of cells. Moreover, mCA
that do not affect copy number or transcript abundance and do not reside in open chromatin regions are all
undetectable with current methods. This proposal aims to develop methods to improve detection of mCA that
will enable novel lines of inquiry in kidney, blood and other non-neoplastic tissues. Our single-cell methods will
be complemented by algorithms to localize mCA in spatial transcriptomics datasets, which may provide insight
into how mCA affect disease progression via interaction with neighboring cells. In addition, we will design high-
throughput assays that can be used to evaluate mCA burden at low cost in a wide variety of sample types. All
methods will be released as open-source protocols and software packages that researchers can tailor to their
tissue of interest and may lead to novel therapies that aim to eliminate cells with mCA."

 Excellent mentorship is critical to the career success of clinical and translational scientists. As such, the
CTSA K12 program is aptly named the Mentored Research Career Development Award Program in Clinical and
Translational Science. K12 Scholars generally have a team of mentors comprised of content experts,
methodologists, and career development advisors. The new CTSA K12 funding opportunity announcement
(PAR-21-336) also requires each Scholar’s mentoring team to include a clinician, and for Scholars planning to
lead or gain experience in clinical trials, a clinical trialist mentor. As with the other components of the CTSA
grant, the K12 also emphasizes diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA). Evidence-based mentor
training for clinical and translational scientists is available and widely used, including at our University of Texas
Health Science Center at San Antonio (UTHSCSA) CTSA hub, yet no such training exists for non-researcher
clinicians interested in co-mentoring researchers.
 The aim of this administrative supplement is to 1) develop, 2) implement, and 3) evaluate a short mentor
training workshop for clinicians and clinical trialists at UTHSCSA and its CTSA partner, UT Austin, and then to
disseminate the training program throughout the CTSA Consortium. Experts in mentorship training from the
University of Wisconsin (UW) and experienced clinician-investigators from our hub will co-develop a mentor
training curriculum for 24-30 clinician/clinical trialist mentors. The anticipated 4-hour curriculum will cover 6
standard core competencies along with elements from the Enhancing Cultural Awareness curriculum and a
newly developed workshop on team mentoring, and will be offered in-person at one study site and virtually at
the other so as to enable comparing modalities. Clinicians completing the mentor training will then be matched
to current K12 Scholars and join their mentorship teams. The clinician mentor will advise the Scholar regarding
feasibility of conducting clinical research projects, translating research findings into clinical practice, and other
matters as they arise. A mixed-methods evaluation will assess the experiences of clinician mentors and K12
Scholars once they have worked together. To sustain the program beyond the grant award period, using their
train-the-trainer model, the UW team will train a UTHSCSA CTSA hub co-investigator to administer the training.
We will disseminate the curriculum through the national KL2/K12 PI Directors Consortium Group; the recently
launched CTSA Mentorship Community of Practice led by UW; conference presentations; and publications.
 Although the proposed clinician mentor training is designed to fill the needs of K12 Scholars locally and
nationally, other trainees, such as predoctoral and postdoctoral T32 trainees, and junior faculty conducting CTS
stand to benefit as well."
11051516,"The overarching goal of this supplement proposal is to support a graduate student
from an underrepresented population to determine the role of TDP43 proteinopathy and
endogenous retroviruses in the pathology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/frontotemporal
dementia and Alzheimer’s and related dementia, using the established approaches and
strategies from the parent grant.
 In the Drosophila system, it has been established that ERVs and DNA damage play
a causal role in cell-autonomous glial cell death and in non-autonomous toxicity to nearby
neurons. Although the impacts of ERVs/RTEs have been described in Drosophila and
increased levels of ERVs/RTEs have been measured in human tissues, there are yet no tests
of this hypothesis in the initiation and progression of disease during development and aging
in a mammalian model of ALS or FTD. Here we propose essential tests of our novel
hypothesis to establish the temporal, spatial, and cell-specific impacts of TDP-43 pathology
on ERV/RTE expression and on disease progression and spread within the CNS. In addition,
we will provide a PLATFORM that will enable the field to uncover cellular mechanisms by
which RTEs/ERVs may contribute, and to do so in a vertebrate model.
 We are investigating a novel integrative in vivo experimental approach with the power
to provide insights into RTE biology, neurodegenerative phenotypes, and focal and
longitudinal perturbations in a vertebrate model of TDP-43-ALS/ADRD. The low-expressing
TDP-43 mouse strains in Aim 1 of the parent grant are mostly completed under another PhD
student, but Ariel Nieves will continue and complete these experiments. The main work for
Ariel will be to incorporate tools that we have established in our laboratory for sparse
expression (Adeno-associated viruses, AAV) in the rodent system, enabling us to manipulate
gene function in specific and focally initiated populations of cells (neurons, glia), and to
delineate effects on nearby, unperturbed cells or tissues."

 Among people living with HIV (PLHIV), stigma and mental illness (MI), such as depression, bar access to
care and worsen health outcomes, particularly in countries like Malawi where 10% of adults are living with HIV
and up to a 25% of PLHIV have co-morbid depression. As depression treatment is increasingly integrated into
HIV care, interventions helping to reduce stigma for patients facing multiple and intersecting stigmas— HIV,
MI, and intersectional stigma— are crucial for engagement in care and improvement of health outcomes. Yet,
most individual-level stigma-reduction interventions address only one type of stigma. As such, there is a
missed opportunity to address multiple stigmas at once to serve patients. The overall aim of this proposal is to
consolidate an evidence-based HIV-MI stigma-reduction intervention with depression treatment for PLHIV and
conduct a hybrid effectiveness-implementation pilot to evaluate its implementation and impact on patient
outcomes in Malawi. My long-term career goal is to become a leading researcher on implementing and
evaluating intersectional interventions that address stigma and meet the mental health (MH) needs of PLHIV.
This K01 award will enable me to build upon my strong foundations in epidemiology, qualitive methods, and
implementation science to address gaps in my training and develop the necessary expertise to transition into
an independent investigator. My training goals are to obtain: 1) substantive knowledge in intersectional stigma
and individual-level stigma-reduction interventions; 2) theoretical and methodological skills to combine and
consolidate multiple evidence-based interventions using a participatory community-based research approach;
and 3) expertise in designing and executing hybrid effectiveness-implementation studies to evaluate both
implementation and clinical (e.g., HIV and MH) outcomes. These goals will be achieved through a combination
of direct mentorship, coursework, seminars, directed readings, workshops, conferences and hands-on
experience. In my proposed research, I will first combine interventions that address HIV, MI and intersectional
stigma, consolidate with depression care for PLHIV and develop plans for implementation drawing from focus
groups and interviews (Aim 1). I will then evaluate the implementation of the consolidated HIV-MI stigma-
reduction intervention and its impact on patient stigma, depression, and HIV care engagement in a two-site
pilot hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial (Aim 2). This innovative research will (a) address HIV, MI and
intersectional stigma while leveraging existing MH services, (b) prepare for multi-level stigma-reduction
intervention packages, and c) yield detailed insights into barriers and facilitators of implementing stigma-
reduction interventions in low-resource settings. Ultimately, the proposed study and training will provide me
with the skills and preliminary data for an R01 proposal to conduct a full hybrid effectiveness-implementation
trial to implement and evaluate a multi-level stigma-reduction intervention in Malawi."
11051277,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor and is incurable,
invariably recuring after standard therapy with surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. GBM cell heterogeneity
allows it to thrive in varying adverse conditions in the tumor microenvironment (TME), including therapeutic
insults, hypoxic stress, and immune attack. Interactions with cells in the TME—including neurons, glia,
endothelium, and immune cells—support this heterogeneity and plasticity, contributing to the tumorigenicity,
resistance, and recurrence of this deadly disease. Given the limited efficacy of standard treatment approaches
in GBM, there is an urgent need to decipher and therapeutically target protumorigenic interactions in the TME.
There is evidence that glioma cells form an interconnected network that facilitates the exchange of mitochondria,
which are the main energy-producing organelle and regulate metabolism, proliferation, and epigenetics. There
is also early evidence that mitochondria can be transferred from non-malignant cells to cancer cells. However,
there is limited understanding of mitochondrial transfer dynamics from the TME to GBM; the
mechanisms that govern this transfer; and the downstream effects of transfer on recipient GBM cells.
Addressing this knowledge gap is vital for designing therapeutics that target this interaction. I hypothesize that
mitochondria are transferred from neural cells in the TME to GBM by the action of fusogenic proteins, and that
this transfer drives tumorigenicity by metabolic and epigenetic reprogramming. Specific Aim 1 will test the
hypothesis that astrocytes are the predominant mitochondrial donors, and that transfer is mediated by fusogenic
proteins termed syncytins. I will investigate mitochondrial donor identity using transgenic mice and cell models
expressing lineage-specific mitochondrial fluorophores. I will test how knockdown and overexpression of
syncytins affects rate and protumorigenic effects of transfer from astrocytes to GBM cells. Specific Aim 2 will
test the hypothesis that mitochondrial transfer from astrocytes drives GBM proliferation and tumorigenicity by
metabolic and epigenetic reprogramming. I will investigate how transfer of ATP-synthase with mitochondria
drives tumorigenicity; how mitochondrial transfer results in plasticity of GBM heterogeneity by global metabolic
reprogramming; and how mitochondrial transfer drives proliferation by epigenetic reprogramming and increased
chromatin accessibility. Career development and long-term objectives: I will receive training in cancer
metabolism and brain tumor research, and interact with a mentorship committee of experts from both fields. This
training and the proposed studies are invaluable for my career goal of establishing an independent research
program with the following long-term objectives: (a) elucidate molecular mechanisms of how mitochondrial
transfer reprograms metabolism and epigenetics, (b) develop therapeutics targeting mitochondrial transfer and
its downstream effects, (c) investigate how metabolic interactions in the TME impact other treatment modalities,
including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy in GBM and other cancers."
11039507,"Dissociation is a transdiagnostic, and disabling phenomenon that involves detachment
from the self or surroundings. It occurs in the context of many trauma and stress-related
disorders, and is a barrier to recovery in first-line treatments. Dissociation is characterized by
disruptions in attention and interoception, and has been frequently observed in Black
communities as a response to racial stressors. Mindfulness meditation, including breath-focused
mindfulness meditation (BFM), is designed to enhance interoceptive awareness to physiological
signals (breath), but is often a difficult task for dissociative people, who experience disruptions
in attention and interoception. Exteroceptive feedback enhances interoceptive awareness and
attention in experimental studies and may similarly facilitate changes in brain oscillatory
patterns, including alpha and theta power measured via electroencephalography (EEG) which
correspond with attention and interoceptive awareness. EEG studies have largely excluded
Black populations due to data quality challenges related to use with Black hair; however, there
are strategies to address these issues. As such, the goal of this project is to 1) use EEG in a
sample of trauma-exposed dissociative Black individuals to examine potential changes in alpha
and theta power during BFM augmented with exteroceptive feedback. This is delivered by a
unique device that vibrates in concert with respiration, which may enhance body agency and
efficiently engage attention and interoception networks; 2) provide didactic and experiential
training on the use of EEG in clinical neuroscience research for a diverse group of trainees at
different stages of professional development. We will recruit 36 trauma-exposed Black
individuals with clinically significant dissociation, divided in 4 equal groups to yield a 2x2 (BFM
or non-judgmental awareness x with or without vibroacoustic stimulation) design. All participants
attend 8 sessions of their assigned intervention. We will use EEG to examine potential change
in alpha and theta power with changes in attention and interoception from pre- and post-
intervention. We will examine, in Aim 1, whether changes in alpha and theta power correspond
with change in attention, interoception and clinical changes, and whether BFM with vibration
feedback significantly moderates these changes. For Aim 2, we will provide hands-on training
on the use of EEG in clinical neuroscience research settings, with a particular focus on
optimizing EEG data collection and quality control with Black populations. Our ultimate goal is to
create a sustainable program of psychiatric EEG research at Emory University School of
Medicine that is optimized for use with Black participants"
11047380,"Project Summary
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is the most under-recognized public health issue in the US affecting more
than 35 million adults and it is projected that 47% of 30-year-olds will develop CKD in their lifetime. CKD is also
one of the strongest risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Treatments to slow progression are limited and
clinical trials to develop new therapies lag many other fields, partly due to limitations of existing clinical endpoints.
Progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) may take decades making trials expensive and slow, while
biomarkers like serum creatinine lack sensitivity and predictive value. ESKD requires kidney replacement therapy
either by transplantation or dialysis. Kidney biopsy is the only diagnostic tool to differentiate active and potentially
reversible tissue pathology from chronic irreversible one, and is also used for surveillance in transplant patients
to rule out allograft dysfunction. Renal fibrosis is the final common pathway in nearly all CKD cases, and
presence of fibrosis predicts progression to kidney replacement therapy. The presence of interstitial fibrosis in
transplant predicts chronic allograft nephropathy and can be prevented if detected early. However kidney biopsy
is invasive, carries risk, and is prone to sampling error because only a small fraction of the kidney is sampled.
There is an urgent unmet need to non-invasively quantify renal fibrosis throughout the entire kidney tool to
evaluate donor tissue, to predict clinical outcomes in transplantation and high-risk CKD patients, and to monitor
response to novel therapeutics.
Allysine is post translational amino acid formed on collagens by the action of lysyl oxidase enzymes that are
upregulated during fibrogenesis to crosslink newly formed collagen matrix. Recently, we reported allysine-
targeted magnetic resonance probes that could noninvasively detect and stage renal fibrogenesis in mouse
models of nephrotoxic nephritis, Alport syndrome, and renal ischemia-reperfusion injury. To accelerate clinical
translation of this technology, we adapted the probes for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging since
PET probes require only small amounts of material and an abbreviated safety/toxicology program compared to
MR probes. Also, unlike MRI which requires a scan before injecting the probe and another scan afterwards, PET
only requires a single scan. The overall goal of this project is to develop an optimized allysine-targeted PET
probe and validate it in animal models and with human renal biopsy samples. We will perform additional IND-
enabling studies such as radiation dosimetry estimation in nonhuman primates, GLP toxicology, and develop a
GMP manufacturing process. Success in this project will have us poised for subsequent human clinical trials."
11045160,"Abstract
Understanding how T cell receptors (TCRs) see tumor antigens presented by MHCs is necessary to fully
understand how the immune system recognizes tumor antigens, and to reap the full potential of antigen-specific
immunotherapy. To achieve this goal, a quantum leap forward is required in which the revolutionary advances in
machine learning are combined with a large volume of structure, function, data on matched TCR-pMHC pairs.
The development of accurate predictors of TCR-antigen recognition will be dependent on the creation and
integration sequencing-based datasets with high-throughput structural and functional insights. Our proposal,
submitted as a CRUK/NCI Grand Challenge team (MATCHMAKERS) will combine researchers with expertise in
immunology, methods development, structural biology, and computation to enable generalized prediction and
design of TCR recognition. This work will be spread across four Work Packages (WPs):
WP1: Large-scale generation of TCR-pMHC pairs from naturally occurring sources. We will build datasets of
naturally occurring TCR-pMHC pairs. Our team will use an array of approaches to collect these datasets, from
humans and from mouse models, and in the context of both cancer and immunity more generally.
WP2: Ultra-high throughput TCR-pMHC matching using molecular engineering. Efforts to create general models
will require a broader array of data than feasible to collect from natural TCR systems. We will use an array of
synthetic approaches developed by our team to comprehensively match TCRs with pMHCs to train
computational models.
WP3: Large-scale structural and biochemical analyses of TCR-pMHC interactions. A key to our team’s vision is
to match interaction datasets with high throughput structural and functional insights. A deep understanding of
how the TCR contacts with MHC helices control function and orientation will be essential for training and testing
computational models.
WP4 AI-based prediction and design of TCR-pMHC interactions. We will integrate our data to train next-
generation algorithms capable of generally predicting and designing TCR-pMHC interactions. These predictions
will proceed through a reiterative testing and feedback circuits for further model optimization."

 The proposed research is a longitudinal study in adolescents aged 13-20 years old (N = 1,000) triangulating
(1) ecological momentary assessment (EMA) with (2) concurrent data/meta-data text collected from adolescents’
smartphones using the Effortless Assessment Research System (EARS). The project aims to model the
bidirectional association between the language used on social media and internalizing symptoms. This study
builds on our prior work, the Studies of Online Cohorts for Internalizing symptoms And Language (SOCIAL),
which have focused on (1) adults (21+; SOCIAL-I: N=1,123), (2) late adolescents (SOCIAL-II: N = 6,105),
and (3) individuals with internalizing symptoms being treated with internet based cognitive-behavioral therapy
(CBT, SOCIAL-III: N= 421). The SOCIAL data suggest that language that is cognitively distorted (CD), unduly
negative, rigid, or absolutist, can be detected from passively-acquired social media text. Moreover, CD language
is associated with internalizing symptoms and more likely to be used by late adolescents than their adult
counterparts. Thus, CD language may partly account for observations that social media use are associated with
internalizing symptoms in adolescents.
 SOCIAL-IV extends on SOCIAL I-III by (a) including 13-16 olds to study a more variable (i.e., 13-20) year age
range, (b) with a more diverse sample, (c) using intensive longitudinal self-report data derived from EMA, and (d)
studying all text adolescents produce on their smartphones, including social media content and non-social media
content. The SOCIAL cohorts are based on the idea that by curating large samples that triangulate self-report
with natural language and meta-data from social media, we can improve our understanding of the effects of
social media on mental health, paving the way for future interventions. SOCIAL-IV will help us uncover how CD
language is linked to internalizing symptoms, to study how CD language propagates on social media, and to
explore individual differences in the susceptibility to CD language.
Aim 1 uses dynamic structural equation modeling (DSEM) to triangulate the intensive longitudinal data derived
from EARS with the intensive longitudinal data derived from EMA. We hypothesize a bidirectional relationship
between CD language and internalizing symptoms. Aim 2 will sample public social posts from SOCIAL-IV
participants to establish whether CD content is more contagious on social media than non-CD content. We
hypothesize that, consistent with our prior data, CD language will yield more engagement than non-CD language.
Aim 3 seeks to explore whether individual differences, including sociodemographics (e.g., being LGBTQ+),
psychiatric symptoms (e.g., co-morbid externalizing symptoms), self-reported social media use (e.g., perceived
impairment), and data and meta-data collected from social media (e.g., follower count), moderate the bidirectional
association between CD language and internalizing symptoms. We hypothesize that adolescents from minoritized
groups and with more severe psychopathology will exhibit a stronger CD language-internalizing symptoms link."
11043271,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Brachial plexus birth injury (BPBI) is a traumatic perinatal neuromuscular injury causing muscle paralysis and
lifelong arm impairment. Muscle paralysis in these children also leads to bone and joint consequences, including
deformed growth of the scapula and humerus. BPBI occurs during a critical period of rapid musculoskeletal
growth, but the parallel postnatal interactions of muscle and bone that drive these persistent deformities are not
understood. Clinical reports and preliminary work suggest that short, contracted muscles after injury can alter
mechanical loading of the shoulder consistent with observed bone deformity at macro- and microstructural levels.
Altered active limb function with reduced range of motion and load bearing is also present; disuse is known to
alter tissue growth and maturation. Finally, nerve injury in other conditions also affects bone growth directly, and
direct effects in the postnatal period are not clear. Identifying appropriate targets for future treatment requires
understanding which factors associated with altered bone and muscle development are most critical for driving
altered growth. Almost nothing is known about the timing and progression of changes in underlying bone and
muscle structure or metabolism following nerve injury occurring at birth to provide a foundation for clinical
decision-making. Our primary hypothesis is that the bone deformity following BPBI is driven primarily by the
mechanical environment, derived from impaired longitudinal growth of paralyzed muscle and altered active
functional loading beginning shortly after injury. We will apply our unique rodent and computational models of
BPBI that probe the separate contributions of nerve injury and muscle contracture to perform complementary
assessments of the relative contributions of nerve injury, passive muscle loading, and active functional loading
following BPBI to bone deformity. We will do so using 1) previously validated rat neurectomy models of brachial
plexus injury and our unique disarticulation model of altered loading and 2) an integrated computational model
to determine which specific features of bone deformity following BPBI are driven primarily by each potential
driver. This R01 project, conducted by a multidisciplinary team with expertise in orthopedic surgery and
biomechanical engineering, has high potential to elucidate the role of denervation in the parallel development of
bone and muscle that occurs postnatally. Our innovative study design permits us to isolate both direct neural
effects and indirect effects from altered passive and active mechanical loading on bone development in a way
that has not previously been possible. Ultimately, this work has the potential to shift current research and
treatment paradigms from an isolated focus on muscle as a treatment target to an integrated muscle and bone
approach based on driving factors of deformity and loss of function. We anticipate our results will provide new
candidates for improved treatment of BPBI and other neuromuscular injuries."

In 2019, Hispanic/Latinx individuals were awarded 8.6% of the 187,568 doctoral degrees awarded in the US
despite accounting for 18.5% of the US population, while African American graduates were awarded 9.2% of
doctoral degrees despite accounting for 12.5% of the population. One reason for this disparity may be that
doctoral training including training of substance use researchers tends to take place at large Research 1 (R1;
Carnegie very high research activity designation) institutions, yet the majority of underrepresented minority
(URM) students who attend college in the US are not doing so at an R1 institution. For example, 67% of
Hispanic/Latinx college students attend Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) with only 10 of the 646 HSIs in the
US designated as R1 institutions. Students who attend HSIs, because they have had less access to research
opportunity and have fewer people in their peer networks who seek graduate training, may not have had the
chance to envision a post-baccalaureate life that involves graduate training. As a result, a significant
prospective pool of exceptional students do not make their way to doctoral training programs thereby greatly
delimiting diversity among, for example, substance use researchers. To bridge the divide between HSIs and
research-intensive environments we propose to recruit URM undergraduates from HSIs in their sophomore
year to participate in a two year program at New York University (NYU) with the goal of strengthening research
capacity and supporting application to an R1 graduate school. Recruitment sites include Mercy College and
five HSIs located across NYC that participate in the City University of New York (CUNY) Macaulay Honors
College. NYU faculty and mentors include over 20 NIDA-funded investigators from diverse racial/ethnic
backgrounds. Among DDIS scholars, we aim to build skills in foundational and implementation science
research methods and knowledge of substance use research through coursework and seminars (Aim 1). DDIS
scholars will complete in-person Research Methods Weekend Workshops at NYU (monthly; academic Year 1);
online modules in substance use research (~monthly; academic Year 1); in-person/teleconferenced seminars
at NYU for ongoing skills training (weekly) and Mercy College for career development (biweekly) over the
course of the two year program. We also aim to build capacity in conducting research, completing scientific
deliverables, and applying to graduate school through a sustained, intensive mentored research experience
(Aim 2). During the junior year DDIS scholars will be matched with a NIDA-funded research mentor at NYU
and will become integrated into the lab. In the summer between the junior and senior year, DDIS scholars will
work onsite at NYU and participate in an intensive mentored research experience. Through the senior year,
mentors will support student presentations, publications, and application to graduate training. Providing
rigorous and sustained training to support completion of scientific deliverables will increase competitive entry
into a doctoral program at an R1 institution among URM scholars, thereby paving their path to independence."

This Idaho INBRE team science administrative supplement titled, “Establishing a developmentally inspired
biomaterial platform to direct stem cell tenogenesis” fits the Idaho INBRE-4 parent grant scientific theme of
Cell Signaling. Tendons are strong, collagenous musculoskeletal tissues that transfer mechanical forces from
muscle to bone. There is a clinical need for novel regenerative therapies to treat tendon injuries as healing is
limited and injuries are associated with long-term loss of function. Three interdisciplinary investigators will work
as a team to leverage their individual expertise to design a biomaterial polymer platform to control tenogenesis.
Our team includes experts in the areas of tendon development and mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)
differentiation (Dr. Schiele – Biomedical Engineering), polymeric hydrogels and biomaterials (Dr. Bernards –
Chemical Engineering), and peptide synthesis and organic chemistry (Dr. Waynant – Chemistry). There is a
limited understanding of the biochemical and mechanical factors that regulate tenogenesis. Normal embryonic
and postnatal tendon development will inform our tenogenic strategy. By leveraging the strengths of the team,
we will advance a novel hydrogel platform and knowledge of tenogenic regulators. We will determine the
combination of developmentally identified biochemical and mechanical factors that regulate tenogenesis and
deliver those factors with a novel biomaterial platform. We hypothesize that developmental factors can be
rationally designed into a new class of zwitterionic cross-linked polyampholyte hydrogels to direct MSC into
functional tendon cells. The project has two specific aims. Specific Aim 1 develops our team and defines the
roles that peptides mimicking the developmentally identified cell-cell junction proteins (cadherin-11 and N-
cadherin) and extracellular matrix proteins (fibronection and collagen) have on the induction of stem cell
tenogenesis. These signals will be delivered from polyampholyte hydrogels synthesized with novel zwitterionic
cross-linkers, which are designed to control the presentation of the desired cell signaling peptides. Specific Aim
2 expands this family of zwitterionic cross-linkers to finetune the mechanical properties of the polyampholyte
hydrogels to match specific stages of tendon development. This will determine how the tissue elastic modulus
and biochemical signaling together control tenogenesis. To meet Idaho INBRE goals, this team science project
also provides opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to design and test this biomaterial
platform, which further enhances the pipeline of well-trained biomedical researchers. The combined results
from this team effort will be a family of tunable zwitterionic cross-linker species that are incorporated into
polyampholyte hydrogels designed to deliver biochemical and mechanical developmental factors that regulate
tenogenesis. We anticipate this will represent a significant breakthrough in modeling and understanding tendon
development to guide effective regeneration strategies. These results will be the preliminary data for a
collaborative NIH funding application."
11044576,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a type of non-invasive brain stimulation that applies constant,
low levels of direct electrical current to the scalp to modulate brain excitability. While tDCS is used in
neurorehabilitation to augment motor learning, the evidence supporting this use is somewhat inconclusive, with
many reports of null findings. Current study designs do not adequately control for participants’ expectations
about tDCS, which may exert a powerful placebo effect on motor learning (as well as cognition, pain, or
anxiety). The long-term goal is to maximize motor learning by considering person-centered perceptions of brain
stimulation in addition to the effects of electrical stimulation itself. The overall objectives in this R21 application
are to demonstrate that expectations about tDCS (i) play a significant role in enhancing motor learning,
independent of any real stimulation (i.e., an expectancy effect vs. a treatment effect of tDCS) and (ii) can be
leveraged to maximize the benefits of tDCS in enhancing motor learning. The central hypothesis is that higher
expectations about the efficacy of tDCS are associated with more skill improvement following motor practice,
even in placebo conditions (sham tDCS). The rationale for this project is that considering people’s expectations
about tDCS will not only improve the reproducibility and rigor of future tDCS research, but will also maximize
the overall benefit of tDCS for improving and restoring health. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing
two specific aims: 1) Determine the extent to which priming expectations of tDCS will modulate motor skill
learning and 2) Determine the extent to which sham tDCS improves motor skill learning. For the primary aim,
suggestive information will be used to prime participants’ expectations to be more positive or more negative
prior to motor training with sham stimulation. For the secondary aim, the effects of unprimed tDCS during
motor training will be compared to a control group with no exposure to the tDCS device at all (motor training
only). The research proposed in this application in innovative, in the applicant’s opinion, because it is a major
departure from the status quo of tDCS research by considering and measuring how participants’ expectations
of tDCS affect motor learning and rehabilitation, independent from any effect of the stimulation itself. The
proposed research is significant because it is expected to shift current research and clinical practice paradigms
that use tDCS for treatment. Ultimately, adopting an integrative health approach that considers how people’s
perceptions and expectations of tDCS (and other non-invasive brain stimulation techniques) will have a greater
impact on health and health care than simply focusing on parameters of the electrical stimulation itself."

Candidate: The PI is a Research Assistant Professor and nutritional epidemiologist whose primary career goal
is to apply epigenetic approaches to improve the understanding of the interplay of sleep/circadian rhythms and
nutrition on long-term cardiometabolic health risk. The proposed award includes a 5-year plan of training and
research centered on circadian rhythms, epigenetics, study design, and skills required to lead a research team.
Research context: Insufficient and mistimed sleep is recognized as a risk for adverse cardiometabolic
outcomes. Adolescents are especially vulnerable as they have high prevalence of both short sleep duration
and misaligned sleep timing. Yet, the unique contributions of sleep duration and circadian misalignment to
cardiometabolic risk is unclear. Uncovering the epigenetic mechanisms behind these relationships is a highly
promising avenue for this public health issue. Recent cross-sectional evidence shows that epigenetic
alterations of metabolic and circadian genes might play an intermediary role in the relationships between
sleep/circadian rhythms and cardiometabolic health, yet longitudinal investigations are scarce. The application
of epigenetic approaches to identify potential mechanisms that link sleep to cardiometabolic health is novel.
Research Objectives: The aims are two-fold: 1) to evaluate the independent associations of sleep duration
and timing with cardiometabolic health among adolescents and 2) to examine epigenetic associations between
insufficient/mistimed sleep and cardiometabolic health.
Research Plan: The PI will analyze existing data from an NIH-funded established cohort study of adolescents
in Mexico City with highly variable sleep patterns (some participants' sleep patterns are constrained by
morning school shifts while others have more flexibility due to an afternoon school shift). Associations between
objectively collected sleep data (7-days of actigraphy) and cardiometabolic biomarkers (adiposity, blood
pressure, and insulin resistance collected at two time points 24 months apart) will be analyzed. Stored
leukocytes will be used to measure gene expression and epigenome-wide DNA methylation. Longitudinal and
epigenome-wide statistical analyses will be conducted.
Career Goals and Development: The PI will gain expertise in assessment of circadian rhythms, epigenetics
laboratory investigation, and epidemiological study design through didactic and hands-on experiences. She will
also advance in her leadership, mentorship, and grantsmanship skills, and by the end of the training period will
apply for an R01 centered on sleep/circadian rhythms, nutrition, and epigenetics.
Environment: Resources available to the PI include a well-rounded and supportive team of mentors
representing the fields of sleep/circadian rhythms, epigenetics, nutrition and cardiometabolic health; and the
excellent research infrastructure at the University of Michigan School of Public Health where the PI has been
guaranteed 80% of time devoted to the research goals delineated in the proposal."
11047155,"Project Summary:
Since the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization Supreme Court decision in June 2022, multiple
states have implemented abortion bans. While not the intended target of abortion restrictions, care for
pregnancy loss often overlaps with abortion care and can be affected by abortion policy. Given the dynamic
ongoing state policy changes, the lack of baseline monitoring of pregnancy loss and treatment trends, and the
known socioeconomic and racial variation in pregnancy loss care, it is imperative to document clinician and
patient experiences of navigating pregnancy loss care and to develop data collection systems that can be used
to monitor changes in practices and outcomes over time. The goals of the proposed study are to assess: 1) the
extent to which pregnancy loss management practices are influenced by newly-enacted policies related to the
Dobbs ruling; 2) the implications of these new policies and practice changes for patient-centered quality care;
and 3) which institutional factors may be influential in supporting patient-centered care despite restrictions. We
will conduct an exploratory sequential mixed methods study with the following three aims: AIM 1 – Characterize
clinician attitudes, knowledge, and decision-making related to clinical management protocols for pregnancy
loss in states with new abortion restrictions following the Dobbs decision. Using a combination of rapid
qualitative analysis (RQA) and traditional thematic qualitative methods, we will conduct in-depth interviews with
diverse clinicians (n=30-40) providing pregnancy loss care, recruiting across practice settings and state
abortion policy. In this analysis we will document real-time decision-making and understand practice changes
and the barriers to and facilitators of evidence-based patient-centered care. AIM 2 – Document patient
experiences with pregnancy loss management practices in states with and without new abortion restrictions
following the Dobbs decision. We will conduct in-depth qualitative interviews with patients (n=40-50)
experiencing pregnancy loss, with representation across first and second trimester, state abortion policy, and
demographic characteristics. Using a similar approach to Aim 1, we will explore patient understanding and
effects of policy changes and the barriers and facilitators of high-quality care. AIM 3 – Monitor and evaluate the
impact of restrictive abortion policies implemented post-Dobbs on first and second trimester pregnancy loss
management practices using EPIC and EPIC Cosmos electronic medical record data. We will first develop and
internally-validate a set of search filters to identify pregnancy losses, treatments, complications, and delays in
care (Aim 3a).We will then validate filters externally at other institutions to confirm fidelity (Aim 3b), and then
will use filters to collect data at four case study institutions in most and least restrictive policy environments to
assess changes in care related to state policy using a differences-in-differences analysis, and assess impact
on disparities in care using a triple-differences analysis (Aim 3c). We will then apply filters to aggregate data in
EPIC Cosmos to assess national trends and the impact of the Dobbs decision nationwide (Aim 3d)."

In response to RFA-DA-21-012, “Elucidation of mechanisms underlying complex morbidities of SUD and other
mental Illnesses in people living with HIV/AIDS” (PLWH), we propose to investigate reward and pain circuitry in
cannabis use and depression comorbidity, two highly prevalent conditions in PLWH. We will focus on young
adults (ages 18-34) to minimize HIV neuronal chronicity effects and in light of the high rates of substance use
and reduced adherence to HIV treatment in this age group. Our proposed model is: 1) Both reward dysfunction
(deficits in reward learning, expectancy, attainment, positive prediction errors) and pain hypersensitivity (pain
sensitivity, aversion, negative prediction errors) contribute to cannabis use and depression comorbidity in young
PLWH. 2) The habenula (Hb), a small limbic hub, plays a pivotal regulatory role in these processes by inhibiting
ventral tegmental area (VTA) reward signals to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) following pain and loss. 3) THC,
a major component of cannabis, exerts its psychoactive analgesic effects by binding to cannabinoid 1 receptors
in the reward and pain systems, including the anterior cingulate (ACC), periaqueductal gray (PAG), thalamus,
amygdala, VTA, NAc, and Hb, creating temporary relief of mood and pain symptoms but resulting in long-term
alterations in reward circuitry that exacerbate depression and substance use. 4) Capitalizing on improvements
in fMRI resolution, our novel imaging methods overcome prior technical constraints to study the Hb and other
small structures critical to reward and pain processing. Supporting data from PLWH ages 18-34 in our health
system show that 43% have depression, 21% have cannabis use disorders, and only 68% had undetectable HIV
viral load (VL). Using the reward flanker (RFT) and reward prediction error (RPET) fMRI tasks, we documented
distinct brain activity during reward anticipation, attainment and prediction error, which predicted future
depression severity. Further, we detected Hb activation during RPET and a pain task, and mapped Hb intrinsic
functional connectivity (iFC) with regions critical to reward (VTA), pain (insula, PAG), or both circuits (NAc, ACC).
Distinct Hb iFC were documented in relation to depression, anhedonia and cannabis use. We hypothesize that
cannabis use and depression in young PLWH have an additive effect, inducing both reward deficits and pain
hypersensitivity and that this pattern will predict worse outcomes at 1 year follow-up. We will utilize a 2×2 factorial
design: 1) 70 depressed cannabis users; 2) 70 depressed cannabis non-users; 3) 70 non-depressed cannabis
users; and 4) 70 non-depressed cannabis non-users. Participants will have comprehensive evaluations at
baseline, 6- and 12-months including depression, substance, reward, pain, anxiety, trauma, HIV treatment, CD4+
count, and VL. Baseline cognitive testing and fMRI (resting-state, RFT, RPET, pain) will be performed. Analytical
approaches will include machine learning classifications."
11047485,"The Department of Veterans Affairs is the largest single provider of medical care to people with HIV in the United
States. With the advances achieved in antiretroviral therapy (ART), Veterans with HIV now survive decades.
However, this success is tempered by the rising burden of obesity now affecting 78% of Veterans. Defects in
adipose tissue lipid storage and regulation are hallmarks of both treated HIV and obesity, which leads to a high
degree of ectopic fat infiltrating organs and tissues such as skeletal muscle. The condition of excess lipid within
and around muscle, termed myosteatosis, predisposes Veterans to physical function decline, frailty, disability,
and cardiometabolic diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. In our current Merit supported
cohort, we found that 36% of Veterans with treated HIV have myosteatotic type obesity. Further, we found that
high ectopic fat accumulation in muscle (quantified by CT imaging of skeletal muscle density) is associated with
reduced mitochondrial oxidative capacity, greater inflammation, and impaired muscle glucose tolerance and
insulin sensitivity. Hence the quality of muscle is just as important as the quantity of muscle. However, this
important phenomenon has received little attention, especially in Veterans with HIV. Indeed, the need to target
mobilizing and metabolizing skeletal muscle ectopic fat while preserving/increasing the total amount of skeletal
muscle is most often overlooked and represents a major research gap and unmet clinical need. From our current
Merit Award funded study, we have an established collaboration of experienced VA researchers with expertise
in HIV and immunology, human nutrition and metabolism, endocrinology, radiology and imaging science, and
muscle physiology. Based on our findings, we have designed a multipronged integrated intervention that
combines: 1) dietary replacement of saturated with unsaturated fats; 2) coadministration of L-carnitine and
omega-3 fatty acid supplementation; and 3) targeted resistance exercise training. This evidence-based
intervention is designed to: a) increase lipid flux by facilitating the transfer of long-chain fatty acids into muscle
mitochondria for β-oxidation; b) decrease muscle proteolysis; and c) lessen insulin resistance and inflammation.
Using a randomized crossover placebo-matched trial design in a cohort of 47 Veterans who have HIV and
obesity, this study will determine the effects of the multi-pronged integrated intervention on: skeletal muscle
density, mitochondrial oxidative capacity, and fatty acid oxidation (Aim 1); glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity,
and inflammation (Aim 2); and cardiopulmonary exercise tolerance and physical function (Aim 3). Obesity in
Veterans with treated HIV is a heterogeneous condition. Our current Merit research shows myosteatotic obesity
is a distinct condition from visceral or sarcopenic obesity, affected by different clinical factors. Our findings to
date provide the foundation for a novel evidence-based intervention that has the potential for significant clinical
impact on Veterans, including and beyond those with HIV. This proposal meets VA-ORD priorities to improve
health behaviors, focus on underserved Veterans, and provide precision care."

The sharp increase in mental health symptoms among adolescents has triggered alarm regarding possible
sources for this increase, with much public concern focused on the high consumption of social media by youth.
Although numerous studies have examined linkages between adolescent social media use and mental health
outcomes, much of this research uses self-report assessments and cross-sectional designs, which are limited
by inaccuracy and inability to determine temporality in associations. Moreover, less research attention is
dedicated to the early adolescent period (ages 10–12). This developmental period marks the first entry into the
digital world for many youth and is a critical window during which to understand the effects of social media.
Body image concerns is an element of mental health that is especially relevant for social media use, and early
adolescents are developmentally at risk for negative body image perceptions and subsequent mental health
challenges. This study will examine how early adolescents use social media with a focus on how this use
relates to body image concerns, as well as how visual attention biases to highly visual self-focused digital
content relates to both social media use and body image concerns. We will also examine the role that parents
play in these associations. Parents are known sources of influence on adolescents’ body image concerns and
can also shape how adolescents select, interact with, and interpret social media content. For example, a
parent who demonstrates visual attention biases to appearance-oriented stimuli may intergenerationally
transmit these biases to their adolescent. This longitudinal study will examine an early adolescent sample (N =
200) at two time points: first, when adolescents are entering the 6th grade, and second, when adolescents are
entering the 7th grade. Adolescents and their parents will complete measures of their social media experiences,
as well as their body image concerns, at both time points. Self-reports will be supplemented with objective
measures of adolescent social media use via a) recordings of smartphone app usage, and b) recordings of
accounts followed on major social media platforms, with public accounts coded for appearance-oriented
content. Adolescents and their parents will also complete an eye-tracking task assessing self-focused visual
attention during a video chatting task. By collecting these data over time, we can examine how body image
concerns and visual attention to digital stimuli may change in concert with changes in social media use, with a
special focus on appearance-oriented social media use. Specifically, we can examine bidirectional
associations between early adolescent social media use, visual attention biases to self-focused digital content,
and body image concerns, with an additional focus on how parent body image concerns and self-focused
visual attention biases may predict these attitudes and behaviors. The information gained can inform
prevention and intervention efforts targeting unhealthy social media use during adolescence, such as by
testing parents as a source of influence and identifying visual attention biases as a risk factor."

Children’s early vocabulary skills cast a powerful predictive spell over their subsequent language48,96,97 and
educational36,83,143 outcomes. At the same time, bilingual children’s language-specific vocabulary skills lag behind
those of their same-age monolingual peers14,15,49,58,62,87,88,93,97,146,156,160,161,162,164. This lag in language-specific
vocabulary is seen as inevitable and persistent because of distributed exposure of bilingual input across two
languages109,113. The crucial gap in the literature is that the effect of distributed exposure on bilingual
children’s word-learning has not been tested experimentally. The overarching goal of the proposed work
therefore is to test how distributed exposure affects word learning in bilingual children. To this end, we
situate the proposed study within the Cross-Situational Statistical Word Learning (CSWL) framework, where the
formation of links between words and their referents relies on the ability to aggregate statistical information
across multiple exposures to ambiguous mappings between multiple words and referents46,142. Rather than
framing our inquiry in terms of bilingual / monolingual comparisons, we instead harness the CSWL paradigm,
and focus on experimentally manipulating the exposure parameters within the bilingual participants. Our
participants are Spanish-English bilingual toddlers with typical language and who are late to talk, as well
as Spanish-English bilingual children with Developmental Language Disorder (DLD). Specific Aim 1 is to
test the effect of distributed exposure on CSWL in samples of 2-year-old bilingual toddlers enriched for history
of late-talking. In a series of four experiments, we will systematically manipulate exposure parameters, and test
specific, mechanistic hypotheses regarding the effects of these manipulations on children’s CSWL. Specific
Aim 2 is to test the developmental trajectory of distributed-exposure effects and language outcomes in bilingual
children with a history of late-talking. The same children recruited under Specific Aim 1 will be tested again at
age 4, enabling us to examine how learning from distributed exposure changes over time, and identify factors
that predict recovery of expressive language skills in bilingual late-talkers. Specific Aim 3 is to test the effect of
distributed exposure on word learning in 4-year-old bilingual children with DLD. The prediction stemming from
bilingual/monolingual comparisons literature is that distributed exposure will interfere with learning (vs. single-
language exposure). The alternative prediction stemming from theories of CSWL172,174 and from the limited
experimental studies of bilingual learning73,119 is that effects of distributed exposure may be limited, or even
facilitative for bilingual children. Proposed studies will move theories of bilingualism and of CSWL forward by
identifying the specific mechanisms by which distributed exposure does (or do not) impact word learning in
bilingual children. In practical terms, the proposed studies will reveal whether there is an optimal
exposure/intervention strategy for successful acquisition of two languages, and whether it works equally well for
children with typical language skills and for children who are at risk for language impairment."

11046820,"Many neuropsychiatric disorders involve compulsive behavior, including obsessive-compulsive behavior,
obesity, eating disorders, alcoholism, and addiction. Compulsive behavior appears to arise from impaired top-
down control of striatal learning mechanisms, particularly involving circuits between the orbitofrontal cortex
(OFC) and the caudate nucleus (CN). Theories of decision-making have emphasized a complex relationship
between fast, automatic, habitual processes and slower, deliberative, goal-directed choices. These distinct
processes are thought to map on to distinct frontostriatal circuits with automatic processes and goal-directed
choices linked to different striatal regions. Theoretical accounts of OFC control have argued that it is
responsible for providing state information to CN, ensuring that the valuation of reward outcomes is
contextually appropriate. Recent psychophysics results have shown that habitual responses are prepared
simultaneous with goal-directed responses, but are inhibited to allow the slower, goal-directed response to
occur. This raises the possibility that OFC may have a gating function, similar to that which has been posited
for more dorsolateral frontal regions, whereby it inhibits habitual responses to allow goal-directed behaviors.
In the current grant, we will test the hypothesis that OFC is responsible for inhibiting habitual responses in the
striatum when top-down control and more deliberative decision-making is required. We will use a novel
behavioral task that enables us to manipulate the amount of top-down control required for a decision using two
conflicting reward contingencies. This is manifest as an increase in the amount of time necessary to make the
decision as well as the number of saccades that the animals make to either option. In addition, we have spent
the last year developing methods to lower the new primate Neuropixels probes into deep targets within the
brain, including OFC and CN, and for managing the large amounts of data that these probes generate allowing
us to use population-level decoding to investigate the dynamics of these cognitive processes with high
temporal and single-trial resolution.
In addition, we will test a second hypothesis that OFC accomplishes striatal inhibition via coherence in the
alpha band. We have previously shown, via closed-loop microstimulation, that reward-based learning depends
on theta coherence between OFC and the hippocampus. However, recent work has emphasized the role of the
alpha band in mediating inhibitory processes, both in the frontal cortex and in posterior sensory cortex. We will
use our expertise with closed-loop microstimulation to test whether OFC inhibits CN via alpha coherence
during top-down control.
Understanding the dynamics of OFC-CN interactions will lay the groundwork for building devices that can
meaningfully interact with these circuits."

The placenta performs important functions to ensure proper development of the fetus, including oxygen and
nutrients exchange, waste product removal and hormone secretion. It also acts as a barrier to protect the fetus
from harmful substances and pathogens that might be present in the maternal circulation. Despite its short
lifespan, the placenta plays a critical role in the survival and growth of the fetus. Implantation failure and
inadequate placental development can lead to pregnancy complications, such as preeclampsia, miscarriage,
and fetal growth restriction. However, our understanding of human placenta development is quite limited due to
scarcity of fetal tissues, ethical restrictions and lack of practical experimental tools.
 Our preliminary studies show that human trophoblast stem cells (hTSCs) possess an intrinsic self-
organization property. When a colony of hTSCs starts to cluster, they spontaneously form an organoid with
cavities resembling trophoblastic lacunae, and can continuously develop into a multicellular tissue resembling
first-trimester placental villi under a neuregulin 1 (NRG1) stimulation. In this proposed research, we will
undertake an exploratory, high-risk but high-reward study to generate a microfluidic human placenta model.
Specifically, we will derive hTSCs from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) through a naïve
pluripotency stage. We will then use these hTSCs to generate microfluidic placenta organoids. The role of YAP
signaling in regulating spontaneous syncytiotrophoblast (STB) differentiation will be examined. We will further
induce the development of placental villus-like tissue by modulating timing and concentration of NRG1, and
examine morphologies and cell composition of the resultant placenta organoids. Important, we will conduct
single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis on the resultant placental villus-like tissue at different times
and perform transcriptome-wide comparisons with published in vivo human placenta scRNA-seq datasets.
 This hTSC- derived human placenta organoid system will offer the first-of-its-kind experimental platform
for studying previously elusive stages of human placental development. This research, if successful, will lead
to innovative technologies and methodologies for controllable, reproducible, and scalable manufacturing of in
vitro stem cell-derived tissues with molecular and cellular characteristics consistent with the early/mid-gestation
placenta. This platform can also serve as a screening tool to investigate the potential negative effects of
pathogens, drugs or toxic substances on human placental development, which will accelerate research efforts
towards early diagnosis, prevention and treatment of pregnancy complications associated with insufficient or
abnormal placentation."
11047631,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Overweight/obesity is strongly linked to mortality from multiple chronic diseases, including obesity-related
cancers. For health disparity-facing populations, including racial/ethnic minority and/or low income individuals,
who have both high prevalence of obesity and cancer, interventions promoting behavioral change for nutrition,
physical activity, and weight are a national health priority. A growing knowledge base documents the efficacy of
community health worker supported interventions for improving behavioral change due, at least in part, to their
unique insights into how an intervention should be adapted to social and environmental contexts. While there
has been a rapid expansion in the use of digital technologies for delivering health interventions, there has been
little study of the potential use of these technologies in the U.S. by non-professional health workers, including
community health workers. Yet, it is not yet clear if digital technologies alone are efficacious for weight loss,
particularly among health disparity-facing populations, or if a more intense intervention consisting of a
combination of community health workers plus digital technologies will be needed to successfully promote
weight loss among health disparity-facing populations. In the proposed research study, we will target weight
management among obese residents of Boston's public housing developments who are low-income and
predominately from racial/ethnic minority groups. This R01 proposal seeks to examine the efficacy of an
intervention approach that combines mHealth technology plus website-driven behavioral counseling from
community health workers. Our hypothesis is that in a 12-month cluster-randomized trial (n=504) comparing 3
public housing developments (n=168 participants) who receive community health worker motivational
interviewing behavioral counseling plus mHealth self-monitoring/text message feedback (mHealth+CHW),
versus 3 developments (n=168) who receive the mHealth self-monitoring/text message feedback only
(mHealth only), versus 3 developments (n=168) who receive assessment only (control group), both
mHealth+CHW and mHealth only will outperform assessment only control and mHealth+CHW will outperform
mHealth only in terms of weight loss at 12 months. For secondary outcomes, we will examine intervention
effects on diet and physical activity behaviors. We will also examine mediating effects of Social Cognitive
Theory constructs and moderating effects of participant characteristics and social contextual variables on the
effect of the intervention. Finally, we will conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis. Our results will enable a better
understanding of efficacious approaches to weight management among health disparity-facing populations,
which may be applied to other modifiable cancer risk behaviors and be extended into the larger federal network
of public housing administrations."
11046830,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
 Cardiac fibrosis is regulated by the activation and phenotypic switching of quiescent cardiac fibroblasts
(CFs) to active myofibroblasts (MFs) which have extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and contractile
functions which play a central role in cardiac remodeling in response to injury. As such, there is consensus
effort in the field to manipulate fibroblast activity for therapeutic gain. However, a more complete understanding
of the signaling pathways and mechanisms that regulate MF activity in cardiac remodeling remains an unmet
need.
We previously demonstrated that the RNA binding protein Human antigen R (HuR) directly mediates
hypertrophic signaling in cardiac myocytes (CMs), and that CM-specific genetic deletion or pharmacological
inhibition of HuR reduces pathological remodeling and preserves cardiac function following transverse aortic
constriction (TAC)-induced pressure overload in part through a reduction in pro-fibrotic gene expression. New
preliminary data suggests that HuR activity in cardiac fibroblasts may play an equally important role in cardiac
remodeling. Our new data demonstrates a necessary role for HuR in MF activation and the ECM-remodeling
capacity of cardiac fibroblasts. Furthermore, we have identified Wisp1 (Ccn4) as a downstream HuR-
dependent mediator of MF activation, and show that exogenous addition of recombinant Wisp1 partially
restores MF activity upon HuR inhibition.
 The primary goal of this proposal is to determine the functional role that HuR-Wisp1 signaling plays on MF
activity and whether functional inhibition of these pathways in fibroblasts will provide therapeutic benefit during
pathological cardiac remodeling. Our central hypothesis is that HuR-Wisp1 signaling in cardiac
fibroblasts is necessary for myofibroblast activity and promotes pathological cardiac remodeling. The
specific Aims of this proposal are to:
 (1) Determine the functional role of HuR in CFs in vivo and define its pleiotropic role across cell types
 during pathological cardiac remodeling.
 (2) Identify the functional and mechanistic role of HuR-dependent control of Wisp1 expression on MF
 activity and pathological cardiac remodeling.
 The expected results of this proposal will provide a deeper understanding of the functional impact of the
HuR-Wisp1 signaling axis across cardiac cell types during pathological cardiac remodeling that is necessary
for potential therapeutic manipulation of HuR or HuR-dependent gene expression in cardiac remodeling as
suggested by our previous work."
11046837,"Obesity has been widely associated with increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) extending beyond
common co-morbidities, such as dyslipidemia and diabetes, as evidenced by increased CVD risk in
‘metabolically healthy obese’ individuals. However, a full understanding of the mechanisms that drive this
association remains an unmet need. Adipose tissue serves a broad role as an endocrine organ and has been
shown to have a multitude of effects on cardiac physiology depending on metabolic state, adipose depot
location (e.g visceral vs. subcutaneous), and primary cell type (e.g. brown vs. white). As such, the long-term
goals of my laboratory are to increase our mechanistic understanding of adipose tissue-derived endocrine
signaling to the myocardium and specifically how it is impacted by (1) brown adipose tissue (BAT)-mediated
energy expenditure and (2) changes in adipose tissue homeostasis.
 To this end, we have recently identified the RNA binding protein HuR as a novel mediator of the adipose-
cardiac signaling axis and have shown decreased HuR expression in subcutaneous WAT (scWAT) from obese
mice and humans corresponds with decreased cardiac function. Specifically, we recently showed that
adipocyte-specific deletion of HuR in mice (Adipo-HuR-/-) leads to a deficiency of BAT-mediated thermogenic
metabolism, which is strongly associated with cardiovascular health, and is sufficient to induce cardiac
hypertrophy and fibrosis. Preliminary data suggests that this cardiac pathology is driven by HuR-dependent
adipose-derived extracellular vesicles (Ad-EVs).
 Our central hypothesis is that decreased HuR expression in adipose tissue contributes to cardiac
pathology through disruption of adaptive thermogenesis and Ad-EV mediated endocrine signaling.
 Aim 1 will elucidate the mechanisms by which HuR mediates calcium cycling in BAT and the functional
contribution of these HuR-dependent pathways to thermogenic metabolism. The working hypothesis is that
HuR mediates thermogenesis in BAT through regulation of calcium (Ca2+) cycling. Aim 2 will delineate the
functional role of HuR-dependent Ad-EVs on cardiac hypertrophy and identify the translational link between
HuR activity and gene expression in human adipose tissue and cardiac function. The working hypothesis is
that the loss of HuR expression in adipose tissue, either through genetic deletion or obesity, mediates a pro-
hypertrophic endocrine signaling to the myocardium via Ad-EVs.
 This work is timely and innovative given our recent publications, the association of BAT activity with
cardiovascular health in humans, and findings from Scherer and colleagues showing that large circulating EVs
from adipocytes directly impact cardiomycotyes in vivo. Our results will increase our mechanistic
understanding of (1) HuR as a mediator of thermogenesis via Ca2+ cycling, (2) adipose tissue signaling to the
myocardium, and (3) the translational link between adipose tissue gene expression and cardiac function."
10912728,"SUMMARY – PROJECT 1: Molecular response to base-modifying chemotherapeutic agents Repair of base damage on DNA is critical because such damage is both genotoxic and mutagenic. Many chemotherapeutic agents used for cancer therapy, such as cisplatin and alkylating agents, induce this type of damage and are one of the most commonly used modalities for treatment, underscoring their clinical significance. While much is known about how cells respond to DNA containing base damage, the importance of RNA damage has become increasingly appreciated only recently. Indeed, alkylated RNA is estimated to comprise the vast majority of the damaged nucleic acid in cells treated with such agents. It is not surprising then that cells have evolved a number of mechanisms to cope with damaged RNA. We have discovered that the ALKBH3-ASCC repair complex mediates the cellular response to DNA as well RNA base damage. Our work implicates RNA damage recognition and signaling as a critical node in the cellular response to base damage, an underexplored area, which we seek to understand in this renewal application. We will use structural biology methods, including crystallography, SAXS, and molecular modeling, to determine the mechanism of ALKBH3 and ASCC1, both of which are either known to harbor or are predicted to act on RNA substrates. Furthermore, we will use a combination of structural methods and biochemistry to reveal the mechanistic basis of the enzymatic activities within the ALKBH3-ASCC complex. Together, the proposed work will reveal important insights into the contribution of base damage responses and its relevance to tumor cell eradication."

Enzymes are crucial biological catalysts that expedite challenging reactions across all domains
of life. While the development of structural biology methods over the past century has enabled
visualization of these fascinating systems, our understanding of the dynamic processes that
facilitate enzyme reactivity remains limited due to the timescales on which they occur. The
overarching goal in my research group is to develop and apply time-resolved methods capable of
visualizing these processes to elucidate the mechanisms of metal-containing enzymes important
for human health and medicine. Heme-dependent enzymes are of particular interest due to their
role in aerobic metabolism ranging from signal transduction, antibiotic biosynthesis and immune
response. Despite sharing similar structural motifs and catalytic intermediates, heme-dependent
enzymes are capable of catalyzing a wide range of reactions beyond their archetypal
hydroxylation outcomes. This project aims to investigate the structural features and dynamic
behavior that enables this atypical reactivity from dioxygenation to nitration and beyond. In
particular, we plan to repurpose biochemical tools capable of pausing turnover, such as
substrate/cofactor analogs and site-directed mutagenesis, as well as apply state-of-the-art time-
resolved methods that my group is currently developing, to visualize short-lived catalytic
intermediates via a combination of X-ray crystallographic and spectroscopic approaches.
Although applied to specific systems herein, the proposed methodologies may have utility in the
study of heme-enzymes more broadly, as well as other metalloenzymes. Likewise, the anticipated
results have the potential to impact both biocatalysis and the downstream development of
biotechnologies and therapeutics in the treatment of cancers and infectious diseases."

Social media has a complex influence on mental health. It can contribute to bullying and harassment, which
may result in loneliness, depression, and suicidality, but it can also be helpful, by fostering social connections
and offering resources; these influences may both harm and benefit the same individuals. Transgender youth
is a highly vulnerable group, who is often subjected to bullying and are far higher risk for self-harm and
suicidality than cisgender youth. An increasing number of trans adolescents are using social media. In this
proposed study, we intend to understand the effect of emotionally laden social media content consumed by
trans and gender non-binary adolescents (TGNB) (ages 15 - 20) and its connection to suicidality. We focus on
high schoolers and emerging adults, as suicidality rates in this group of social media users is higher than
among middle-schooler social media users. Existing research is largely cross-sectional, correlational,
retrospective, and focuses on “posts” (content individuals produce themselves), which limits its utility in
understanding fully the impact of social media on adolescents, for three reasons. First, most social media use
consists of passive consumption, not active posting. Second, it is important to gain in-the-moment information
about emotions individuals experience when a particularly salient social media content is consumed. Finally,
retrospective and correlational designs lack the capacity to generate or test predictive models. To address
these gaps, our study will be prospective and longitudinal, focusing on passive social media consumption, and
deeply individualized and person-centered. We will adapt `Photovoice' (PV), a commonly-used community-
based participatory research method that is considered an excellent method for understanding the
perspectives of individuals, including those from underrepresented populations. We will use a previously
piloted S.T.A.R (Screen Tag and React) app, with which participants will be able to capture screenshots of
anything they see on any social media platform, indicate their emotional reaction to that content, and upload
these on a secure cloud server. Participants will be recruited largely from social media groups for TGNB
populations and their parents. Participants will use the S.T.A.R. app for 8 weeks, undergo an interview to better
understand the images they capture, and then use it for another 8 weeks so that prediction models we develop
could be evaluated. Thus, with this study, we will be able to understand whether, for each TGNB adolescent,
the unique patterns of positive/negative emotions elicited by social media are associated with patterns in
weekly assessment of suicidality. We will also be able to determine whether specific types of social media
content are associated with changes in suicidality scores for transgender adolescents. Finally, we will be able
to create a prediction model to map social media content types and related emotions to predict suicidality."

Molar hypomineralization (MH) is a prevalent enamel defect affecting 15% of children worldwide and is
characterized by soft and porous demarcated opacities on the enamel surfaces of primary and permanent
dentition. These soft spots on enamel have elevated protein content, hindering restorative success. This
defective enamel's unique structure and composition facilitate the continuous transmission of oral stimuli to the
dentin-pulp complex underneath the enamel. Therefore, children with MH suffer greatly from longstanding
hypersensitivity associated with an underlying pulpal inflammation called pulpitis. However, the mechanisms of
bacterial-induced pulpitis fail to explain the MH-associated pulpitis, hindering effective diagnosis and treatment.
This project aims to dissect the role of sensory neuron-driven and bacterial-driven activation of pulpitis in MH
using in vivo and ex vivo approaches by studying the innate immune responses of the dentin-pulp complex.
Finally, we aim to test the effect of enamel remineralization on bacterial colonization and bacterial-driven immune
response of the dental pulp organ. We hypothesize that continuous activation of the sensory neurons and
bacterial infection contribute to the development of pulpitis in MH in tandem, and treatment of the soft enamel
will reduce the pulpal response. Two specific aims are proposed to test this hypothesis: Aim1) The role of sensory
neuron activation in pulpal inflammation will be examined using a hypomineralized KLK4-KO mouse model and
WT mice. Sensory afferents will be activated with repetitive noxious stimuli, and the innate immune responses
in dental pulp tissue will be assessed by flow cytometry, cytokine analysis, and immunofluorescence imaging.
Aim 2.1) The role of bacterial infection in MH-associated pulpal inflammation will be investigated by quantifying
bacterial colonization and activity on enamel surfaces and assessing the therapeutic impact of silver diamine
fluoride. Aim 2.2) The bacteria-induced pulpal immune response will be assessed. Topical SDF application will
aim to remineralize the soft enamel, reduce bacterial colonization on the surface, and improve the barrier function
of enamel against bacterial infection, ultimately reducing inflammatory responses. This research project will shed
light on the mechanistic components of pulpitis in MH patients and facilitate the researcher's transition towards
an independent clinician-scientist career track. During this 5-year K08 Mentored Career Development Award
(PA-20-203), Dr. Karaaslan will receive training and test the proposed two aims under a multidisciplinary team
of mentors and experts in hard tissue biology, microbiology, immunology, and pulp biology. Ultimately, the results
of this study will guide translational and clinical studies to develop targeted therapeutics to prevent and treat
pulpitis in MH patients and the general population."

In response to NOT-OD-24-031 Notice of Special Interest (NOSI, we propose to conduct research on bioethical
issues in the return of individual research results (IRR) that would support the development of an evidence
base to inform future policy directions. We intend to capitalize on a unique opportunity to assess the views of a
large number of research participants at Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC) who constitute an
unusual sample in two critical ways: 1) they are highly diverse; and 2) all will already have received IRR as part
of the NHGRI-sponsored eMERGE-IV study. We will use this sample to explore the experiences and
preferences of people with lived experience of receiving their own research results. A consensus has evolved
that IRR should be offered for return to research participants, as summarized in a 2018 report by the National
Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine. Most of the extant studies address the return of
genetic/genomic results and show a strong desire to receive individual results and largely benign responses to
those results. Although outside the realm of genetics the body of literature on return of research results is much
smaller (e.g., for receipt of disease-associated biomarkers), similar albeit somewhat more variable findings
have been demonstrated. Participants’ consistent preferences to receive individual research results have led to
calls to focus future research on the major outstanding questions involved in return of results: which results
should be offered for return, when should results be returned, how should results be returned, and what
participant characteristics may help to identify and satisfy participant preferences? Ascertaining experienced
participants’ views on these issues is the key focus of this proposal, expanding the focus to a broader range of
research results (e.g., biomedical markers of health, behavior, and environmental exposures) and analyzed
through four Specific Aims exploring: 1) How do research participants’ preferences for return of individual
research results vary by type of result? 2) How are participants’ preferences affected by their demographic
characteristics, including race/ethnicity, education, income, and health insurance status? 3) To what extent are
participants’ preferences for return of individual research results affected by their perceptions of the potential
benefits and risks of their receipt? 4) What are participants’ preferences for the means of IRR and the
information and support that should accompany them? Our results will inform future studies, policies and
practices for the return of study results at Columbia, within the CTSA consortium, and across the larger
biomedical community."

Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting technologies (including extrusion-, droplet-, and laser-based 3D bioprinting)
have been accelerating at a rapid pace and could be revolutionary for precision medicine. The development
and refinement of these bioprinting techniques offer potential for the precise manufacturing cells, tissues, and
organs to be used in clinical care (such as organ transplantations) and for use in important biomedical
research (such as in-vitro tissue models for drug screening and disease modeling). Despite the remarkable
progress and improvements in 3D bioprinting technologies, they are not without challenges (including
vascularization challenges that impede biofabrication of complex structures, such as bone tissue and
bronchopulmonary segments). It is essential for the safe, effective, and equitable design, development, and
ultimate use of 3D bioprinting technologies that the ethical, legal, and social issues (ELSI) are addressed
proactively and concurrently with the scientific challenges. For this reason, bioethics research capacity building
initiatives are urgently needed. To begin to address this need, the proposed project launches a new
interdisciplinary collaboration—involving engineering, bioethics, anthropological, and legal expertise—to create
high-quality, profoundly integrative educational resources and opportunities specifically for current and future
scientists and engineers in the field of 3D bioprinting. In this one-year supplemental project, we will inspire
intellectual curiosity and expand awareness in ELSI among regenerative medicine faculty and students by
hosting a new webinar series on bioethics and bioprinting (Aim 1); creating novel educational modules and
resources for an integrated and adaptable approach to bioethics and bioprinting training (Aim 2); and offer
unique educational opportunities while evaluating the educational modules and resources (Aim 3). By
leveraging the unique strengths of Penn State University (including, notably, the Huck Institutes of the Life
Sciences; the Rock Ethics Institute; and the Law, Policy and Engineering Initiative) and by strategically bridging
an ongoing ELSI research project with an ongoing bioprinting research project, this proposed one-year
supplemental project is intended to produce tools that support instructors in the larger bioethics community and
to encourage other scholars to transcend siloed research practices and dismantle structural obstacles that
hinder much needed multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary collaborations."
11064390,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The primary objective of this application is to investigate siderophore-based immunization and antibiotic
delivery strategies designed to inhibit the growth of Escherichia coli and non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS). These
Gram-negative facultative anaerobic bacteria are major causes of infections in diverse patient populations. E.
coli includes commensal organisms, pathogens, and pathobionts (organisms that are usually harmless but are
pathogenic in some settings) and cause infections that include urinary tract infections (UTI), bacteremia,
meningitis, and sepsis. Moreover, a pathovar known as adherent-invasive E. coli (AIEC) is commonly isolated
from patients with Crohn’s disease, a form of inflammatory bowel disease. NTS, including Salmonella enterica
serovar Typhimurium (STm), are major causes of inflammatory diarrhea. The primary site of E. coli and NTS
colonization is the gastrointestinal tract, where these organisms thrive during colitis and disseminate to other
body sites. Recent studies, including work from our laboratories, demonstrate that iron (Fe) availability is a key
factor for the progression of E. coli and NTS colonization in the gut, motivating the research proposed in this
grant application. Our central hypothesis is that targeting siderophores and their uptake machineries can limit
enteric pathogen growth in vitro and in vivo. Both E. coli and NTS deploy the catecholate siderophores
enterobactin (Ent) and salmochelin (DGE, diglucosylated enterobactin) in the gut to scavenge Fe3+ from the host.
We propose that blocking Ent&DGE-mediated Fe3+ acquisition by bacterial pathogens or targeting Ent&DGE
transport systems to deliver antibiotics will provide a means to inhibit the growth of STm and AIEC in the inflamed
gut. In support of this notion, we developed a siderophore-based immunization based on Ent that inhibits STm
and AIEC growth in the murine gut, and we synthesized and evaluated siderophore-antibiotic conjugates (SACs)
based on the Ent&DGE scaffold that target E. coli and STm. In Aim 1, we will use mutants in Fe acquisition
genes in STm and AIEC to test whether CTB-Ent immunization results in specific inhibition of pathogen growth
and association with the gut mucosa when the pathogen produces Ent&DGE; determine the effect of CTB-Ent
immunization on the mucosal-associated versus luminal microbiota; and ascertain whether neutralizing anti-
Ent&DGE Ig mediate protection by limiting pathogen association with the mucosa. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the
antimicrobial activity of three Ent&DGE-based SACs. Studies in vitro will largely focus on how key environmental
variables that characterize diverse host environments affect the antimicrobial activity of SACs, whereas studies
in vivo will evaluate the consequences of SAC administration on the gut microbiome composition as well as on
inhibiting mucosal expansion of STm and AIEC during colitis. This work may lead to future development of
siderophore-binding antibodies and SACs as therapeutics to limit colonization of enteric pathogens and
pathobionts in the inflamed gut."
11064391,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
About 10-20% of breast cancers are triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC), which have a poorer prognosis and
worse clinical outcome than other types of BC. Due to the lack of target therapies, chemotherapy remains the
mainstay of treatment of TNBC, but acquired resistance often develops followed by metastasis and mortality.
This supplemental project is closely relevant to the ongoing research proposed in the parent grant R01CA260357
and significantly extends the scope of the current project. Our recent study demonstrated that LSD1 depletion
significantly reduced the incidence of BRCA1-deficiency induced mouse mammary gland tumors. Based on this
finding, we hypothesize that LSD1 overexpression is essential for breast cancer initiation and development due
to BRCA1 loss. In Aim 1, we will validate our preliminary findings and characterize the functional role of LSD1 in
BRCA1 mutation mediated TNBC progression. We will also investigate if LSD1 overexpression contributes to
PARPi resistance. Furthermore, we will explore the in vivo roles of LSD1 in tumor progression using xenograft
and mammary gland BRCA1 deficient TNBC mouse models. Cumulative evidence has suggested that epigenetic
silencing of a subset of cytotoxic T-cell lymphocyte (CTL) attracting chemokines (e.g. Th1-type CXCL9 and
CXCL10) plays an important role in shaping the tumor-promoting immune environment. However, the exact
epigenetic mechanisms underlying chemokine silencing are still unclear. Our recent studies showed that LSD1-
mediated silencing of CTL chemokines is associated with H3K4 demethylation at proximal promoter regions.
Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor 2 (TFPI2), a tumor suppressor gene, was identified as a key LSD1 targeted
gene. Induction of TFPI2 by LSD1 inhibition downregulates activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and
promotes stability of chemokines, leading to enhanced CD8+ T-cell infiltration in tumors. Based on these new
findings, we hypothesize that overexpression of LSD1 facilities TNBC progression through promoting immune
suppressive environment. In Aim 2, we will characterize the crosstalk between epigenetic changes and TNBC
immune environment and further elucidate the molecular basis of LSD1-medicated chemokine silencing in
promoting TNBC progression. The proposed studies are expected to provide key preclinical data, novel
mechanistic insight, and rationales to address mechanistic and clinical associations between epigenetic defects
and TNBC tumor environment and tackles a significant clinical problem. Thus, this project has high scientific
significance and clinical relevance."

 Ensuring accurate predictions of the transport and deposition of orally inhaled drug products (OIDPs)
within dry powder inhaler (DPI) flow channels to the human respiratory system is crucial. This is particularly
important given the diverse variabilities such as inhaler design, drug formulation, and user-specific factors (e.g.,
disease-specific lung conditions and patient-device coordination). Such accuracy is essential for demonstrating
comparability and bioequivalence (BE) between generic and reference listed drug (RLD) inhalers, quantifying
their performances' uncertainties. Although CFPD models and discrete element method (DEM) can provide high-
fidelity spatiotemporal distributions of variables of interest (i.e., emitted APSDs, emitted doses, regional lung
deposition fractions) using 3D physiologically realistic human airway geometries, there is a drawback due to the
high computational cost for using such models to investigate how numerous user-specific factors can influence
the comparability and BE. To address such a drawback, the overall goal of this project is to develop advanced
CFD-DEM trained machine learning (ML) models, i.e., AI-empowered reduced order models (ROMs), to
improve the understanding of variability in generic OIDPs, enhance comparability, and demonstrate BE more
efficiently. Our central approach is based on the state-of-the-art CFD-DEM, elastic airway model, and self-
supervised learning (SSL), ensuring a significant contribution to accurately assessing generic inhaler
comparability and performance with the reliable fast-running ROMs as new open-source in silico tool. Limited by
the 2-year time period, the research will pursue three specific aims focusing on inhaled Tiotropium Bromide
laden lactose particles emitted from SpirivaTM HandihalerTM based DPIs in human respiratory systems with
different COPD severities: (1) Aim 1: Quantify variability of inhaler geometric design, drug formulation, and user-
inhaler coordination on emitted APSDs and doses from DPIs using CFD-DEM and develop an AI-empowered
ROM to predict emitted APSDs and doses, (2) Aim 2: Quantify variability of COPD severity on transport and
deposition of inhaled OIDPs in the human respiratory system, and develop another ROM to predict regional lung
deposition, and (3) Aim 3: Integrate the two ROMs into an “All-in-One” ROM for uncertainty quantification. In
both years, we will prepare and submit co-authored manuscripts with FDA OGD, transfer data and codes with
other deliverables, and provide technical training and tutorials to them on using and further refining the ROMs.
The proposed research is significant because the proposed ROMs will address the computational challenges
of current CFD-based models in uncertainty quantification of in silico inhaler comparability and BE studies. The
proposed research is innovative since it will integrate the state-of-the-art CFD-DEM, elastic airway, and SSL for
ROM training and testing. It will create a paradigm shift in regulatory evaluations and advance regulatory
approaches to support innovation, ultimately facilitating the development and approval of generic DPIs."

Strict glycemic control is critical for optimal type 1 diabetes (T1D) outcomes but remains challenging for youth 
from historically marginalized ethnic groups, in whom hemoglobin A1c (A1c) levels are consistently the highest 
in the nation. In California, Latinx youth are the largest marginalized ethnic group with T1D, but they 
experience less optimal glycemic control than their White counterparts. Continuous glucose monitoring, insulin 
pumps, and automated insulin delivery systems can assist with achievement of target A1c levels, but Latinx 
youth have lower rates of diabetes device use compared to White youth. Virtual peer groups (VPGs) can 
improve patient engagement and diabetes self-care in Latinx youth, and preliminary data suggest that VPGs 
may increase the use of diabetes technology in this population. Jenise Wong, MD PhD, and Jennifer 
Raymond, MD MCR, propose this project grant with the objective to increase the adoption and sustained use 
of diabetes devices in Latinx adolescents with T1D by engaging them and their families in the development 
and evaluation of a VPG intervention designed to improve technology use. This project will engage multiple 
stakeholders (patients, families, health care workers) from three clinic populations in California (Children’s 
Hospital of Los Angeles, University of California Davis, and University of California San Francisco) and result in 
the DREAM (Device use Reimagined through Education And Mentorship) program. In collaboration with a 
multidisciplinary team of pediatric endocrinologists, psychologists, and public health experts, the researchers 
propose a project with the following aims: (1) partner with stakeholders to adapt a virtual peer group model to 
promote the initiation and continued use of diabetes technology among Latinx adolescents with T1D, (2) 
evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of DREAM in a single arm, pragmatic trial, and (3) assess the effect of 
DREAM on clinical and patient-centered outcomes. These aims will be addressed in a formative phase and a 
clinical trial phase. In Phase 1, the research team will address Aim 1 by engaging stakeholders in focus groups 
and semi-structured interviews to obtain qualitative data that will directly inform the design of the DREAM 
VPGs and the clinical trial. A subset of stakeholders will form Advisory Councils who will provide longitudinal 
input during the clinical trial. In Phase 2, the research team will conduct a single arm, pragmatic trial of the 
DREAM intervention in 120 Latinx youth aged 13 to <18 years with T1D, recruited from three pediatric diabetes 
clinic populations in California. To address Aim 2, the researchers will collect qualitative feedback from focus 
groups and quantitative data on VPG feasibility, appropriateness, and acceptability as primary outcomes. 
Preliminary data on clinical outcomes of A1c and hospital utilization, and patient-centered outcomes will be 
assessed to address Aim 3. The results of this study will result in a novel, culturally appropriate, VPG model to 
increase use of diabetes technology for Latinx youth with T1D that may be further adapted and disseminated 
for other age groups, geographic settings, or racial/ethnic populations."

It is estimated that fixing problems related to preventable errors costs the U.S. healthcare system $400 billion
annually. In the field of surgery, the most basic element of quality care begins in the operating room (OR), and
>50% of preventable errors that lead to patient harm happen there. The suboptimal performance of OR teams
often lead to adverse events such as wrong site surgery, foreign object retention, and delays that greatly
increase morbidity, mortality, and costs. Though using a surgical safety checklist can prevent errors and reduce
patient harm, measurement of improve critical intraoperative processes has traditionally required putting
observers inside the OR to record and analyze team performance. Since this process is labor-intensive and
costly, it has been limited to a few large academic centers conducting funded research in quality improvement.
The operating room Black Box® (ORBB) is an innovative technological and analytical platform, that
synchronously captures the performance of the operating surgeon and the OR team while simultaneously
recording patients’ vitals and postoperative outcomes. The ORBB uses machine learning to analyze
performance and outcomes, making the program scalable and unlocking the potential for widespread
monitoring and improvement of intraoperative team performance. However, large-scale adoption of the ORBB
is limited by a lack of training programs that incorporate the data into an actionable form and by the absence of
high-quality data on how to implement the ORBB in diverse hospitals. We hypothesize that addressing these
barriers will lead to significant improvement in outcomes for surgical patients and propose three specific aims
to test these hypotheses. In aim 1, a high fidelity immersive multi-player virtual simulator will be developed for
training the OR teams in performing the surgical safety checklist.
In aim 2, the validity and effectiveness of the
virtual simulator in improving the quality of safety will be studied using the ORBB data.
In aim 3, a study of
ORBB implementation will be conducted to identify barriers and facilitators to adoption of the ORBB across the
US healthcare system."

Alcohol (ethanol) exposure during pregnancy is the leading environmental cause of birth defects and central
nervous system dysfunction. While the effects of ethanol on the brain and face have been explored quite
extensively, there is a considerable lack of knowledge regarding the pathogenic mechanisms of developmental
ethanol exposure. A significant amount of work over the years, including from our lab, has demonstrated that
apoptosis is associated with prenatal ethanol exposure. However, apoptosis cannot account for all of the effects
associated with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Previous work on this project has demonstrated that
one non-apoptotic pathogenic mechanism involves the primary cilia. Primary cilia are small hair-like organelles
that are present on almost every cell and are critical for normal development and cellular homeostasis. Genetic
disruptions in primary cilia function have been increasingly explored over the last several years and are classified
under the term ciliopathies. Recent work from our lab has demonstrated that prenatal ethanol exposure can also
temporarily disrupt primary cilia function resulting in a “transient ciliopathy” with a particularly devastating effect
on the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway. However, the cellular mechanism by which ethanol acts at the cilium is
unclear. In this current proposal, we will further explore these mechanisms using a variety of tools and cross-
sectional approaches. In Aim 1, we will test whether ethanol is affecting transport along the microtubule axoneme
within the primary cilium or transport into or out of the primary cilia compartment. Both of these ciliary functions
are vital to normal cilia function and will be probed using a variety of in vitro and in vivo techniques in wild type
and transgenic mouse lines. In Aim 2, we will take advantage of the convergent effects of ethanol and
cannabinoids on primary cilia to explore the role of ethanol in modulating G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR)
signaling. Several GPCRs, including those in the Shh and cannabinoid pathways signal through primary cilia
and this aim will test how ethanol affects these key receptors. Aim 3 will leverage targeted small molecule
screens to identify novel pathways of ethanol's pathogenic mechanisms. Using a combination of high-throughput
in vitro assays and in vivo confirmation, we will identify novel targets of developmental ethanol exposure.
Collectively, these experiments will greatly increase our knowledge of ethanol's mechanisms of actions in the
developing embryo, with important implications for informing clinical research studies and prevention and
intervention strategies as well."

The afferent neurons of the eighth cranial nerve transmit information from the cochlea and vestibular organs to
the brainstem. These neurons can be lost following damaging noise exposure, ototoxic injury, or as a
consequence of normal aging. Once lost, afferent neurons do not regenerate, and their depletion can result in
permanent hearing and balance deficits. In the case of hearing, clinical strategies to restore sensory function,
such as cochlear implants, require survival of a sufficient number of spiral ganglion neurons. Unfortunately,
there is currently no practicable method for replacing lost spiral ganglion neurons. Although the mammalian
cochlea lacks the ability to regenerate neurons, the spiral ganglion contains a population of cells that express
Nestin, which is widely regarded as a marker for neural stem cells. Studies conducted in mice have
demonstrated that these Nestin-expressing cells do not divide once the cochlea has matured, and the signaling
molecules that regulate their proliferation are not known. One factor that hinders the study of neurogenesis in
the cochlea is that the cell bodies of cochlear afferents and Nestin-expressing cells are housed within bone in
the inner ear and are not visually or experimentally accessible in living mammals. The task of developing
methods for neuronal replacement in the inner ear would be greatly facilitated by the introduction of an
appropriate model system to identify the basic cellular signals that permit ongoing addition and spontaneous
regeneration of afferent neurons. The objective of the present proposal is to establish the posterior lateral line
(pLL) ganglion of larval zebrafish as a model system for the study of neuronal repair and replacement. The pLL
ganglion is comprised of ~50 neurons, which can be easily visualized in living animals. Current data indicate
that about five new neurons/day are added to the pLL ganglion, but the identities of neural precursor cells and
the factors that regulate their proliferation are not known. We have found that cells in larval pLL ganglion
express two markers for neural precursors: Nestin and NeuroD. Moreover, expression of these two markers
occurs in spatially distinct regions, suggesting two domains within the pLL ganglion that possess progenitor
cells. Our studies will determine the contributions of each population to the process of ongoing neurogenesis in
the pLL ganglion and reveal whether proliferation of either (or both) cell types is enhanced following ablation of
a subset of afferent neurons. We will also quantify expression levels of Nestin and NeuroD within the ganglion
as function of age to define the contribution of each cell type to the process of neuronal addition and
regeneration. Finally, we will evaluate the function of macrophages in neurogenesis and regeneration of pLL
ganglion neurons. Experiments will determine whether macrophages are activated by neuronal injury and will
resolve whether they help promote the proliferation of progenitor cells. The data generated by this project will
identify the factors that regulate production of sensory afferents and may reveal potential strategies for
inducing proliferation of resident progenitors and differentiation of new neurons in the mammalian inner ear."

In response to the burgeoning worldwide obesity pandemic, the rate of obesity-associated colorectal cancer
(CRC) remains an enormous public health burden. The metabolic determinants of CRC are complex and
remain under debate. Ceramides are pathogenic lipids that signal a state of nutrition excess and accumulate in
organs that are not suited for fat storage, driving insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. Our preliminary data also
demonstrate that ceramides are critical intermediates linking nutritional inputs like fatty acids to intestinal stem
cell proliferation. Our long-term goal is to understand the role of ceramide metabolism in the development of
CRC and to identify pharmacologic and dietary strategies to intervene upon ceramide metabolism for cancer
prevention. Our central hypothesis is that ceramide metabolism is a key component of metabolic
dysregulation underlying CRC. We propose a transdisciplinary collaboration, utilizing epidemiologic and clinical
cohorts and animal experiments, to conduct synergistic analyses and interventions to address our hypothesis.
In Aim 1a, using a rigorous discovery-replication design, we will characterize a ceramide-based CRC risk
score in serum from participants in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)
(n=1260cases/1260 controls), and the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) cancer cohort (n=1234
cases/1234 controls), and identify a dietary pattern strongly linked to ceramides. In Aim 1b, we will determine
the effects of medical and surgical weight loss and changes in body composition on the ceramide CRC risk
score in our ongoing Utah Bariatric Surgery Cohort. In Aim 1c, we will measure the association of genetically
predicted levels of circulating ceramides with risk of CRC using data from 57,873 CRC cases and 67,087
controls in the Genetics and Epidemiology of CRC Consortium (GECCO), and test for gene by dietary pattern
interaction. In Aim 2, we will determine whether systemic or tissue-specific reduction of ceramides affects CRC
development. We will impede ceramide synthesis by inhibiting dihydroceramide desaturase-1 (DES1) action
genetically (Aim 2a) and pharmacologically (Aim 2b), and via a serine or time restricted dietary pattern (Aim
2c), to test for effects on gut, liver and adipose depots and colorectal tumor incidence in an azoxymethane
mouse model of CRC. The study leverages a new class of DES1 inhibitors that lower tissue ceramides and
ameliorate the pathogenic consequences of obesity. The proposed study fills a major gap in evidence for
understanding how ceramides contribute to the metabolic dysregulation underlying CRC. We propose a fully
translational approach integrating epidemiologic associations between ceramides and colorectal malignancies
and preclinical studies testing the utility of ceramide-lowering interventions on cancer endpoints. Findings will
have important implications for understanding the biologic mechanisms underpinning obesity-associated
metabolic dysregulation in CRC and for identifying new targets for CRC prevention.

11063376,"Acute exacerbations, bouts of disease worsening, are common in many chronic conditions like chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). These exacerbations have drastic impacts on whole person
 health, and with prompt treatment and intervention can reduce morbidity and mortality. However,
determining between an acute exacerbation versus daily variation in disease symptomology is
 problematic. In COPD acute exacerbations can be objectively detected using patient-reported outcome
questionnaires that are completed daily. However, due to daily variation, these tools require 2-3 days to
 establish a diagnosis. Moreover, daily questionnaires burden patients, making this approach impractical
for routine monitoring. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to provide a complementary
 objective diagnostic measure to facilitate analysis of multicomponent interventions effects on the
 interconnected physiological systems of the whole person within diverse social and environmental
 contexts. The research objective is to create and validate a multimodal physiologically-based passive
 monitoring system and analytic approach based on biorhythm interconnectivity using three specific aims:
 1) integrate heterogeneous sensing modalities and extract key features from high-dimensional data; 2)
 integrate an electronic nose sensor with the wearable device to improve diagnostic accuracy and
 specificity; and 3) test the hypothesis that biorhythm interconnectivity can distinguish changes in health
 status as identified by validated patient-reported outcomes (i.e. EXACT-RS and CAT). Complementary
 and integrative digital innovations designed for remote monitoring of whole person health can improve
 clinical outcomes by stratifying the risk of exacerbation and offer many advantages, including continuous
 collection of whole person data, remote monitoring of data by clinicians, and the opportunity to guide
 multimodality management to improve whole person health. Our technical platform has been designed to
 be flexible with reconfiguration and integration of additional sensors. This enables utilization of study
findings across diverse chronic health conditions including asthma, heart disease, and other inflammatory

 includes a physician, engineer, statistician, bioinformatician, machine learning/artificial intelligence expert,
and human movement scientist, is uniquely positioned to successfully complete this research."

Excess redox-active iron, and consequent oxidative stress, contribute to the morbidity and mortality
associated with β-thalassemia. Iron overload develops due to low hepcidin and excessive intestinal iron
absorption, and from blood transfusions. Anemia and tissue hypoxia, due to ineffective erythropoiesis,
also typify β-thalassemia. Pregnancy in β-thalassemia is becoming more common but is considered
high risk. The relative contributions of iron overload/oxidative stress and anemia/hypoxia to adverse
fetal outcomes are, however, unknown. Given this gap in clinical knowledge, investigation in this area
of scientific pursuit is warranted. We utilized a pre-clinical model of β-thalassemia, Th3/+ mice, to test
the hypothesis that thalassemic pregnancy disrupts maternal, placental, and fetal oxygen and iron
balance. Indeed, several pathophysiological perturbations were observed in Th3/+ dams (iron overload,
anemia), placentas (placentomegaly, iron loading, hypoxia), and fetuses (growth restriction, iron
loading, oxidative stress, hypoxia and global hypomethylation of DNA in brain), all as compared to WT
pregnancies. Notably, abnormalities were seen even in WT fetuses (and pups) from Th3/+ dams.
Elucidating how these in utero physiological disturbances impact fetal and postnatal development is an
overarching goal of this proposal. In three specific aims, we will expand our experimental analyses of
thalassemic pregnancies to define molecular pathways mediating adverse fetal and postnatal effects.
In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that iron loading exacerbates pathological fetal outcomes in Th3/+
dams. We postulate that high fetal iron increases the risk for oxidative stress, which can cause
molecular, cellular, tissue and organ damage. The rationale is that Th3/+ dams have elevated plasma
iron throughout pregnancy, which contributes to iron loading of Th3/+ and WT fetuses. We also predict
that exposure of developing tissues to oxidative stress in utero increases the risk for postnatal
pathologies. In Aim 2, the hypothesis that hypoxia exacerbates pathological fetal outcomes in Th3/+
dams will be tested. We postulate that hypoxia plays an important role in the development of postnatal
pathologies in mice born to Th3/+ dams, either by itself or in synergy with iron loading/oxidative stress.
The rationale is that ineffective erythropoiesis and anemia lead to fetal tissue hypoxia, which would be
predicted to lead to a shift in energy metabolism and cause other metabolic disturbances. Aim 3 will
test the hypothesis that lowering plasma iron in Th3/+ dams will prevent fetal iron overload. The
rationale is that hyperferremia in Th3/+ dams precipitates fetal iron loading. The approach entails in
vivo inhibition of intestinal iron absorption and iron release from stores. The overarching goal of this
investigation is to define the pathophysiological perturbations associated with thalassemic pregnancy,
which may reveal novel molecular pathways that could be targeted in the future to improve outcomes."
11054873,"Project Summary: As exemplified by the Haber-Bosch reaction, which sustains half the human
population, and enantioselective hydrogenation, which (beyond resolution of racemates) is the
foremost chemical method used to create chiral pharmaceutical and agrochemical ingredients,
catalytic hydrogenation has had a greater impact on humanity than any other chemical process.
Prior to our work, the sole example of a “C-C bond forming hydrogenation” was hydroformylation,
which is now the largest application of homogenous metal catalysis. My laboratory has
pioneered a broad, new family of metal-catalyzed carbonyl reductive couplings that exploit
feedstock pronucleophiles in combination with safe, inexpensive feedstock reductants (H2, 2-
PrOH, HCO2H), and related H2-autotransfer processes (ROH = reductant & proelectrophile) that
directly convert lower alcohols to higher alcohols. These transformations bypass stoichiometric
organometallic reagents and the issues of safety, selectivity, and waste associated with their
use, offering a byproduct-free alternative to a range of classical carbonyl or imine additions. In
the proposed funding period, this reactivity pattern will be extended to couplings of α-olefins and
C-X pronucleophiles, the use of amine proelectrophiles, the formation of quaternary
stereocenters and use of base metal catalysts. Our ultimate objective is to develop
environmentally benign methods for the conversion of inexpensive chemical feedstocks to value-
added building blocks for use in the manufacture of pharmaceutical and agrochemical
ingredients."

Late-life Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) are devastating multifactorial conditions and the

individuals are at the great risk of these conditions, thus permitting accurate prognosis and timely preventative
interventions to reduce the burden. Yet, while several risk factors have been identified for these conditions, sex
differences in these associations have rarely been considered. Furthermore, exciting recent advances in blood
amyloid, tau and neurodegeneration (AT(N)) biomarkers for ADRD means that they could soon be used as
powerful clinical diagnostic and prognostic tools in a personalized medicine approach. However, critical multiple
knowledge gaps remain. Importantly, 1) these biomarkers have not been sufficiently examined in longitudinal
studies of older community- based populations without diagnosed dementia; 2) it is unclear how participant
characteristics such as comorbidities affect the clinical interpretation of these biomarkers; and 3) how their
interpretation may differ between men and women. Together, these large knowledge gaps highlight a crucial
need to develop the first sex-specific risk score for ADRD that incorporates blood AT(N) biomarkers and ADRD
risk factors. Our overarching hypothesis is that AT(N) plasma biomarkers will be predictive of ADRD in initially
healthy community-dwelling older individuals, beyond known risk factors (including age, education, living alone,
diabetes, hypertension, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity), and that these associations will vary
by sex. This project provides an unprecedented opportunity to address this important question within the
context of a rigorous, large-scale study of initially healthy individuals aged 65-98 years from the US and Australia
(12,716 whites, 412 blacks, 339 other minorities) with comprehensive annual in-person cognitive assessments,
adjudicated clinical outcomes, detailed data on socio-economic status, lifestyle and health factors collected over
a median 9+ years, and existing genetic data (APOE4, dementia polygenic risk scores). Leveraging unique blood
samples available at two time-points (n=13,435 at baseline, and ~8000 at 7 to 10 years), AT(N) biomarkers will
be measured longitudinally. This proposal is a unique, highly cost-efficient opportunity to address gaps in our
ability to accurately determine who is at the greatest risk of ADRD, individually for women and men. We will
address critical gaps in identifying which factors influence blood biomarker levels and must be considered when
establishing their clinical reference ranges. The sex-specific risk score resulting from this project will provide a
powerful new tool for practitioners to predict risk of cognitive decline and ADRD that considers common
comorbidities, social, lifestyle, and genomic risk factors, together with the unique predictive strength of the
plasma AT(N) biomarkers."

The overarching scientific premise of our parent grant is to thoroughly investigate the impact of BRCA2 and DNA
damage repair (DDR) gene alterations on the progression of lethal, untreatable prostate cancer. Our aim is to
identify and develop innovative combination treatments, such as targeted immunotherapy and radiotherapy for
BRCA2 deficient prostate cancer patients. However, the impact of alterations in non-BRCA2 HRR genes on
mCRPC progression is not well understood. In the proposed supplemental project, we aim to elucidate the
molecular mechanisms underlying the impact of non-BRCA2 DDR alteration on mCRPC progression.
We will use CRISPR to generate isogenic pairs of prostate cells and organoids by individually eliminating 14
non-BRCA2 DDR genes. We will perform knockout efficiency and assess the impact of individual non-BRCA2
DDR genes on HRR alteration using Sanger sequencing and DNA damage assays, respectively. Using these
models, we will evaluate whether the loss or elimination of any of these non-BRCA2 DDR genes can effectively
promote castration-resistant prostate cancer progression. Transcriptomic analysis from the isogenic pairs of cells
will help us discover targetable signaling pathways and develop novel therapeutics for lethal prostate cancer.
Recent studies have also highlighted that inhibiting the androgen receptor (AR), such as with enzalutamide,
increases the risk of DNA damage by disrupting the protective effects of androgens on genomic stability. Our
team presented the first report of the loss of KDM5D, a chromosome Y histone demethylase and androgen
receptor (AR) interacting protein, which augments prostate tumor growth and castration resistance. We also
showed that the loss of KDM5D leads to replication stress due to impaired DNA damage repair. We aim to
investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the AR-KDM5D pathway-mediated DNA damage repair, which
contributes to the progression of prostate cancer to a lethal state.
Our research has identified that the loss of KDM5D leads to the activation of ATR, a pivotal DNA damage sensor
gene. Based on this finding, our study aims to explore the effects of combining AR inhibitors with ATR inhibitors
on the progression of prostate cancer, particularly in cases where KDM5D is lost.
This proposal presents a unique opportunity for mentorship and training in functional genomics, molecular
biology, and prostate cancer research. It offers the candidate valuable career development prospects.
Additionally, the project allows the candidate to utilize extensive experimental model systems and access unique
resources from the parent grant. These resources are essential for addressing the significant research gap
regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying DDR deficiency-induced lethal therapy resistance in the
progression of prostate cancer. Ultimately, this research aims to identify novel therapeutic targets for combatting
this deadly disease."
11063382,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):
Declines in cognitive and motor function are early harbingers of pending Alzheimer's Disease and related
dementia (AD/ADRD). New technologies for characterizing mobility and cognition have made significant
inroads within the younger, healthier population segments but have not permeated all demographics,
especially among older adults. Additionally, current approaches for monitoring cognition and mobility are
limited to periodic assessments in laboratory and clinical settings, which fail to capture the subtle
gradation and continuous deterioration of these domains. To address this gap, we propose a multi-modal
system of wearable sensors that will provide data to enable breakthroughs in statistical machine learning
and health informatics, allowing for a nuanced, continuous assessment of mobility and cognition.
Critically, our combined hardware/software system will address the unique challenges of an aging
population including the need for a health monitoring system which is both comfortable and easy to use.
In Aim 1, we will develop a system of wearable eutectogel sensor patches that are flexible and breathable,
transparent, and inconspicuous. These individual sensor devices, designed for long-term wear, will
provide direct, continuous, real-time monitoring of eight biophysical domains (gait, posture, head motion,
heart rate variability, respiration, location, orientation, and movement). In Aim 2, building on
state-of-the-art methods for the modeling and analysis of multiple time series, we will develop statistical
machine learning algorithms and models for the estimation of cognitive function and mobility over time
given data from the gel-biosensors. To validate the resulting engineered system, we undertake a
feasibility study to determine the potential of the analytics-enhanced, integrated biosensor system and
machine learning algorithms to predict cognitive function and mobility in 20 older men and women,
starting in a controlled laboratory setting and extending into real-world scenarios. We anticipate our
gel-based biosensor system and machine learning models will advance personalized sensing and health
informatics with long term, direct application to detecting and predicting early development and
progression of AD/ADRD that increasing numbers of older adults are now facing."
11063398,"Stroke is a leading cause of mortality and chronic disability, which predominately occurs due to blood clots
 or plaques impeding the blood flow in the brain (ischemic stroke) or a rupture in brain arteries
 (hemorrhagic stroke). Minimally invasive endovascular procedures, e.g., thrombectomy (removing clots to
 restore blood flow) and neurovascular embolization (deploying coils in aneurysms to obstruct blood flow),
 are employed to treat these two strokes but also pose risks for X-ray radiation exposure. Robots were
 introduced to safeguard operators from radiation and increase precision via teleoperated control several
 meters away from the patient. However, these robots are bulky capital equipment and only mechanically
 compatible with a few instruments. To tackle these limitations, we developed a versatile 4-DOF robot with
 a significantly smaller size than state-of-the-art robots and is compatible with a wide variety of
 instruments. To further improve effectiveness and usability of endovascular robots, we identify three key
 limitations to the widespread adoption of robotic systems: 1) prolonged procedure time due to frequent
 robotic to manual conversions due to lack of full actuation of instruments; 2) steep learning curve and long
 training time for clinicians to implement complex surgical manipulation with robots to perform interventions
 due to the lack of coordinated control and pre-operative training of robot-assisted procedure; 3) elevated
 risks of vessel or aneurysm ruptures due to lack of haptic feedback for instrument-vessel interaction force.
 Our interdisciplinary team, consisting of experts in robotics (Su), mechanics (Jawed), interventional
 neuroradiology (Tateshima, M.D.), anatomy (Hartstone-Rose), human-robot interaction (Joo) will: 1)
 develop full actuation (avoid manual loading/unloading of instruments), coordinated control paradigms,
 and patient-side haptic module for our robot; 2) establish a machine learning-assisted physics-based
 simulation framework for pre-operative training and intra-operative situational awareness; 3) study
 human-robot interaction to evaluate multiple metrics about manual, partial actuation, and full actuation
procedures.
 Our goal is to design intelligent robots in concert with pre-operative virtual training and intra-operative
 virtual fixtures (safety zone) to improve effectiveness and usability, thus ultimately enhancing safety and
 clinical outcome of neurovascular interventions.
RELEVANCE (See instructions):
 Our project entails transformative methods that span design, simulation, and medicine for an in-depth
 understanding of human-robot interaction for a surgery that saves the lives of millions of humans. Our
 work will advance two fundamental science disciplines: Robotics and Mechanics, and will make scientific
 contributions to computer sciences and engineering to improve fundamental understanding of medicine."
11063429,"This project seeks to address the pressing issue of vision morbidity and vision impairment caused by
glaucoma. Glaucoma, a complex and multifactorial disease that develops over extended periods, presents
significant challenges in terms of early diagnosis and effective treatment within the existing healthcare
infrastructure. The research aims to harness the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to not only enhance
our understanding of the disease but also to develop a clinical decision support tool that can significantly
improve glaucoma diagnosis and treatment.
The research seeks to innovate by tackling three specific challenges. The first challenge involves the
development of multi-modal approaches for robust glaucoma detection assessment and vision field loss
prediction. To accurately diagnose a patient, clinicians collect many types of data from several patient
visits. This research recognizes the critical importance of leveraging multiple sources of data to improve the
robustness and performance of glaucoma detection models. By integrating various data types, including
various retinal imaging and vision field measurement data, across different points in time, the proposed
clinical decision support tool is expected to provide a more comprehensive and accurate analysis of the
disease, leading to better treatment outcomes. The second challenge is how to promote trust and improve
adoption of AI-based decision support by clinicians and patients. The human-AI interface should provide
information about the performance and limitations of the model predictions to enable users to make safe
and effective decisions. Recent work has shown that uncertainty quantification can be effective in fostering
trust in AI systems. However, these methods need to be extended to be integrated with our proposed multi-
modal prediction pipeline to ensure robustness across multiple modalities with varying levels of reliability
and correlation structures. The third challenge focuses on mitigating bias and improving fairness in
glaucoma detection. By incorporating multi-modal information, the research aims to address these biases
and improve fairness in glaucoma diagnosis."
11066155,"Project Summary
 There is huge potential benefit for peripheral neuromodulation to treat lower urinary tract (LUT) dysfunction
through highly targeted interventions. But development and optimization of therapies have been slow, we
believe, because we lack the ability to predict the system level, functional response of the LUT to different types
and parameterizations of nerve stimulation. Without such an ability, the only recourse is to explore the vast space
of possible neuromodulation therapies in animal models, which is slow and expensive. The goal of this project
is to invent a predictive model that can assess orders of magnitude more parameterizations through computer
simulation, so we can then focus costly experimental efforts on the most promising computationally identified
candidates.
 To achieve this, we will create a framework that unites two powerful modeling approaches: first-principal
biophysics models and data-driven deep learning. The biophysics models let us precisely and powerfully
represent all the physiology that we understand quantitatively in a way that is both generalizable and
understandable. The problem with only using this approach, however, are the many parts of the LUT that we do
not understand with this level of confidence and detail. We will insert deep neural networks into the model
structure to statistically approximate the less well-understood LUT physiology. We will integrate both approaches
together in a single unified hybrid model, and train (tune parameter weights) the entire hybrid model at once with
data from cystometry experiments. In this way, we retain the power of biophysics-based models while
simultaneously reducing the size (and therefore data requirements) of the neural networks that need to be
trained. The neural networks will also be constrained by our LUT physiology knowledge, because they are linked
directly with biophysics-based models during simulation and training. We call the framework biomechanistic
learning augmentation of deep differential equation representations, or BLADDER.
 In this project we will first design and validate the BLADDER modeling framework using existing biophysics-
based models of LUT organs and training the neural network approximations on data from physiologically
nominal cystometry studies. We will then expand the hybrid model’s generalizability and robustness by
manipulating the biophysics-based models to allow us to train on data from a wide array of experimental contexts.
Finally, we will use the expanded-context model to make predictions about the contributing physiological factors
and optimal neuromodulation therapies for underactive bladder syndrome, a highly prevalent LUT dysfunction
without adequate treatment options. Our project goal is to develop and validate the BLADDER framework, then
use it to make clinically useful predictions for underactive bladder treatment. Our long term goals are to apply
the BLADDER approach to many LUT dysfunctions that could benefit from neuromodulation treatments, as well
as to other physiological systems."
11050788,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a major and growing public health problem that negatively impacts quality
of life. The prevalence of painful arthritis in the U.S. likely approaches ~90 million adults and
clinical sequela of OA-associated pain include decreased mobility and compromised activity.
Importantly, the chronic pain experience in humans frequently includes profound and
debilitating effects on the emotional state, with significant negative impacts on quality of life and
function. Consequences also include impaired performance on cognitive tasks, particularly those
requiring working memory or attentional switching. These effects compound the clinical picture,
contributing to the pain-related depression, anxiety, and emotional distress (the `experience' of
chronic pain). Research relying on rodent models is not translating into new, effective treatments.
One reason for the lack of translational success is that despite the clear importance of emotion
and cognition in the human chronic pain experience, current models of chronic pain in animals
frequently ignore these critical domains. The major goal of the proposed studies is to
bridge this `model gap' and significantly advance translational research capability
by developing and rigorously validating a battery of assays for assessment of
emotions and cognitive function in the pet dog model of persistent OA pain. Pet dogs
with naturally occurring persistent OA pain are already considered a good model of the sensory-
discriminative aspects of OA pain in humans; enhancing the capability of this model will allow
researchers, for the first time, to access a clinically relevant full biopsychosocial
animal model of persistent pain. We will achieve this through developing, refining and
rigorously validating (test-retest, structural, discriminative, responsiveness, and criterion
validity) a battery of emotional and cognitive domain tests, benchmarking against validated
measures of pain and the impact of pain. Applying advanced statistical techniques, we will create
a concise battery that can be feasibly performed in clinical research settings. We bring together
diverse expertise with proven track records of collaboration and established facility resources to
successfully address this critical gap in modeling the pain experience of humans. Successful
completion of this proposed work will validate a highly clinically relevant
biopsychosocial animal model of persistent musculoskeletal pain that has the
potential to radically increase the translation of pre-clinical knowledge into
effective, non-addictive analgesic treatments for humans suffering from persistent
musculoskeletal pain."
11051315,"Project Summary
Historically, osteoarthritis (OA) pathology is defined by the breakdown of articular cartilage. While cartilage loss
remains a hallmark of OA, the pathology of OA is now widely recognized to be a disease of the entire joint,
including cartilage, bone, ligaments, menisci, and synovium. This definition of OA pathology provides a whole
joint perspective; however, there is another problem with this definition of OA – the discordance between OA
pathology and symptoms. Simply put, more degeneration of the joint does not necessarily mean more pain. This
issue markedly complicates the development of pain-relieving therapies for OA, as the collection of all people
with joint degeneration is far larger than the people with OA pathology and painful symptoms. Then, within the
collection of people with OA pathology and symptoms, the etiology of OA is typically unknown and joint pathology
tends to be a poor predictor of symptomatic progression. Thus, when focusing on the development of therapies
for OA pain, the question becomes: Is a model of OA pathology sufficient to model the heterogeneity and
complexity of OA pain? Clearly, disease models are needed for drug discovery, mechanistic testing, and the
translation of new therapies from the laboratory to the clinic. For OA pain, a good model should also reflect the
heterogeneity of the clinical OA pain experience described above. Thus, we propose that the best model of OA
pain is a veterinary clinical population that replicates the breadth of OA cases and heterogeneity of OA
symptoms. In fact, equine OA patients capture the years-long cascade of OA disease progression, model the
heterogeneity of human OA pain reports, and provide unique behavioral parallels for the deep phenotyping
assays currently being used in humans. However, a critical technological gap needs to be closed for studies in
equine OA populations. While detailed behavioral protocols to evaluate pain-related experiences have been
developed and validated for human patient populations, these assessments of behavioral assay reliability and
validity have never been conducted for the horse. This is not to say that pain has not been studied in horses;
gait analysis, sensory function, activity, and heart rate monitoring (among other assays) have all been conducted
in horses with OA. However, pain-related behaviors are typically studied in isolation, and these assays are rarely
assessed for their reliability or validity across studies. A goal of RFA-NS-22-070 is to recapitulate the behavioral
aspects of human pain disorders in large animal models, and thereby provide well-validated measures that
facilitate the development of non-opioid analgesic therapies with little or no addiction liability in the future. In
response to this program, we propose to rigorously test the reliability and validity of pain-related behavioral
metrics in the horse through psychometric analyses, including assessments of quantitative sensory tests (Aim
1), locomotion (Aim 2), and activity and spontaneous behavior (Aim 3). In doing so, we aim to close gaps between
pain assessments in the horse and the human, while providing a thorough assessment of behavioral metrics that
are translatable across the translational pipeline for emerging pain therapies."
11055654,"Multi-organ culture and pumping systems for ex vivo models of immunity in hybrid tissue-chips
A better understanding of cellular and molecular communication between the lymph node (LN) and the organs it
drains is imperative for public health. These events determine how well we fight infections and respond to
vaccines, whether a nascent tumor is recognized and destroyed, and whether our own tissues remain safe from
autoimmunity. However, the dynamic interactions of the lymph node with peripheral organs have been difficult
to study in vivo or in vitro, making it difficult to predict immune responses, understand disease mechanisms, or
design vaccines and immunotherapies. Here, we will develop a microfluidic culture and pumping system
specifically designed to model communication between the lymph node and surrounding organs, to model multi-
tissue immunity. This model will build on our prior establishment of a microfluidic system for co-culture of two
slices under a recirculating loop of media, which showed promise in capturing tumor-induced
immunosuppression of the lymph node (Shim, Lab Chip 2019). We will build on this concept to create the first
tissue slice co-culture system that is specifically designed for use by immunologists and other biomedical
researchers in terms of ease of use for precise flow control and circulation of white blood cells between tissues.
First, we will develop a series of 3D printed multi-organ microdevices for culture of intact tissue slices under
transverse or lateral perfusion, with or without an air/liquid interface (e.g. for brain and skin slices), and supporting
recirculation of white blood cells through multiple tissues. In parallel, we will refine the fluidic control system for
robust and user-friendly multi-slice co-cocultures and lymphocyte recirculation, with scale up to dozens of slice
cultures. We will start from our recent prototype on-chip magnetic impeller-based pump, which is compatible with
cell culture incubators and cell recirculation (Cook, Lab Chip 2022). Combining advanced fluid dynamic
simulations with experimental tests, we will miniaturize the pump to reduce dead volume, ensure consistency of
flow control, and preserve viability of circulating white blood cells. User tests in other laboratories will further
refine the design. Making use of the available flow control, we will test the hypothesis that lymph node tissue
function is sensitive to fluid flow rate, and determine the optimal flow mode for multi-organ lymph node culture.
Finally, we will build on our strong team’s expertise in vaccine immunology to generate a simple model of vaccine
drainage and response of the lymph node to vaccination, as a proof-of-principle for the system. Ultimately, the
user-friendly platform developed here to model multi-organ immune function will enable the biomedical research
community to better predict the response to vaccination and immunotherapy, onset of tumor immunity, and
engagement of brain, gut, or arthritic joints with the lymph node during autoimmunity."

Anxiety symptoms are one of the most prevalent and earliest forms of psychopathology in childhood and have
been linked with lasting effects on socioemotional wellbeing, reduce life satisfaction, and increase chance of
more severe psychopathology developing into adolescence and adulthood. Latinx children and adolescents
experience alarmingly high rates of anxiety and related internalizing disorders compared to other ethnic
groups, with some studies finding rates as high as 40%. Yet, we know little about risk and protective factors for
the emergence of symptoms in these children. Consistent with NIMH’s Strategic Objective 2 “to examine
mental illness trajectories across the lifespan” this K01 proposal will investigate early predictors of emerging
anxious behaviors, including neural biomarkers (Aim 1) and caregiver-child factors (Aim 2), while also
considering how broader cultural processes may influence risk trajectories for Latinx youth (Aim 3) from the
toddlerhood to preschool period. Knowledge from the proposed project could have a substantial impact on our
ability to identify which Latinx children are most likely to start trajectories towards anxiety early in life and could
help generate culturally-tailored interventions to modify developmental trajectories away from increased
symptoms in these children. This proposal leverages the opportunity to add measures to an ongoing 5-year
longitudinal study with children from a primarily Latinx area of Central Texas. This K01 proposal will add an in-
lab visit with neural and caregiver-child observational measures. The proposal will use EEG-based resting-
state measures (i.e., alpha asymmetry, beta-delta coupling) to assess general emotional processing and
regulatory tendencies (Aim 1), and observational measures of caregiver-child interactions to assess caregiver-
child emotion socialization (Aim 2). Additionally, the proposed K01 project will leverage caregiver and child
anxiety symptom and cultural socialization data (Aim 3) already being collected as part of the larger study.
Through this Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) the applicant will get needed training and
expertise on 1) EEG biomarkers in young children; 2) anxiety from a developmental psychopathology
perspective; 3) dyadic and longitudinal data analysis; and 4) cultural approaches. A rich training environment
with a multidisciplinary team of mentors and consultants in each of these areas has been assembled to meet
these goals. Findings from this study will offer the opportunity to map anxious trajectories as well as risk and
protective factors at a younger age than typically studied in Latinx youth development, and when dysregulation
patterns start to become noticeable but are still highly malleable. The proposed research and training plan will
enable the candidate to succeed in their long-term goal of launching a fully independent and unique research
program using multi-modal approaches to study biological and dyadic emotion-related processes, as well as
resilience mechanisms that may shape anxiety trajectories in young, particularly Latinx, children."
11055734,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Despite the hostile environment of the bloodstream where the host immune system is highly active, schistosomes,
parasitic flatworms that cause schistosomiasis that affects over 200 million individuals globally, have a
remarkable ability to thrive inside the vasculature for over several decades. While the tegument (outer skin) has
been shown to play an important role in parasite immune evasion, what remains a mystery is the mechanism by
which parasites neutralize large amounts of immune components that they ingest from the host blood. Our
recently published work reveals that the esophageal gland, an anterior accessory organ of parasite’s digestive
tract, is essential for schistosomes to survive inside the bloodstream. It operates by lysing ingested immune cells
before passing them into the gut, preventing them from accessing the inner parasite tissues. Such observations
lead us to hypothesize that specific esophageal gland proteins block and/or degrade host immune components,
thereby ensuring parasite survival. The main questions that we are interested in are: What are the roles of
esophageal gland factors in degrading and/or blocking host immune components and how do such functions
contribute to parasite survival? What is the mechanism of specific esophageal gland factors in parasite immune
evasion? These will be investigated under three specific aims: 1) Define the esophageal gland cell types and
genes; 2) Determine the role of specific esophageal gland factors in immune cell lysis and parasite survival; and
3) Determine the mechanism of specific esophageal gland factors in host-parasite interaction. In the first aim,
we will systematically identify esophageal gland genes by comparing RNA-seq data between parasites with and
without the esophageal gland tissue. In the second aim, we will functionally interrogate identified genes using
RNAi coupled with an in vitro feeding assay, and determine the viability of candidate gene-deficient parasites
inside the mammalian host. Preliminary results from these aims reveal dozens of esophageal gland factors, two
of which appear to be essential for degrading host immune cells. Thus, in the third aim, we will determine the
activity of the two candidate proteins, identify their binding partners, and decipher the mechanism of host-parasite
interaction. Together, we expect to bring new insights to schistosomes’ esophageal gland-mediated immune
evasion mechanism by identifying essential esophageal gland factors and their mode of action. The proposed
study is innovative since our findings will likely shift the paradigm of schistosome immune evasion, which has
been thought to be driven primarily by its tegument. Our study is significant since it bridges parasite
developmental and translational biology by identifying essential esophageal gland molecules and understanding
how they operate. These candidates may be exploited in the future as potential therapeutic targets that can
complement praziquantel in its limitations and collectively contribute to the fight against schistosomiasis."

Mucins are heavily glycosylated proteins that have been known to play roles in inflammation
and cancer with potential to be therapeutic targets for future treatments1. Probing the mucinome
is something that the Bertozzi lab has worked towards since 2002 in the form of mucin-type
O-glycoproteomics technology development. To build upon these accomplishments, I will work
towards the development of a new mucin-selective enrichment strategy for mass spectrometry
analysis of the “mucinome” by utilizing a novel proximity labeling approach6. To do this, I will
develop a StcE[E447D] mucinase with an iridium photocatalyst conjugate which will catalyze the
labeling of mucin domain containing proteins with a biotin probe which can then be enriched.
The conjugated StcE[E447D] mucinase will be validated utilizing mass spectrometry
glycoproteomics in prostate cancer cell models. Finally, I will also expand upon the existing

High-grade gliomas (HGGs), such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), are notably aggressive,
heterogeneous, and infiltrating brain tumors, presenting significant challenges in surgical
resection and leading to poor survival rates. Despite advancements in surgical techniques,
radiation, and chemotherapy, the invasive nature and high recurrence rate of HGGs limit
treatment effectiveness. Fluorescence-guided surgery with 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) offers
high specificity and sensitivity in tumor margin delineation but is hindered by limitations such as
false negatives due to photobleaching, obstruction by other tissues, low tumor cell density, and
non-efficient dosage timing. These challenges can leave active tumor regions after surgery that
could lead to recurrence and complicate subsequent treatments. Additionally, T1-weighted
imaging with gadolinium-based contrast (T1Gd) often underestimates the tumor burden,
particularly in non-enhancing regions, leading to residual disease. Addressing these challenges,
our study aims to identify MRI features correlating with 5-ALA positive and negative areas in
HGGs to develop a radiomics model predicting 5-ALA fluorescence on preoperative MRI scans.
Our central hypothesis is that a radiomics model can predict 5-ALA fluorescence from MRI
features in glioblastoma patients, and when considering sex differences, further refine its
accuracy. With the proposed model, we intend to improve preoperative planning and surgical
outcomes by accurately identifying tumor margins. Furthermore, we will evaluate the model's
prognostic utility by linking 5-ALA fluorescence predictions to the extent of tumor resection and
survival rates. Given the emerging evidence of HGGs as a sexually dimorphic disease, our
study will also explore sex differences in model development, anticipating significant impacts on
predictive accuracy and survival outcomes. The project aims to provide surgeons with objective
evidence to assess tumor burden, plan surgeries more effectively, and improve survival
outcomes across glioma patient groups. The project proposed here will be an extension of
existing work by the Mathematical Neuro-Oncology (MNO) Lab (Parent Project PI: Dr. Kristin
Swanson), utilizing ongoing research in image-localized biopsies, MRI-based invasion mapping,
and image-based model development."

This proposal is a supplement to our existing Ola Hawaii grant, building upon the foundational
work previously established under this award. Recent advancements in biomedical and health
science underscore the important role of data science in deciphering complex health
phenomena, facilitating access to vast datasets and uncovering underlying patterns. However,
this progress also necessitates a concerted effort to bolster institutional capacity in data science
to fully harness its potential. The proposed data science supplement aims to strengthen
research capacity and cultivate expertise in Hawaii's biomedical and health sciences sector.
Aligned with Ola HAWAII's mission, our supplement focuses on RCMI-related projects to boost
their impact on health disparities research. By integrating data science into these projects, we
aim to gain insights into the health challenges faced by Hawaii's diverse populations. This
approach leverages the RCMI network to enhance research outcomes and understanding of
health disparities. In addition to supporting ongoing research, we also seek to nurture future
talent through educational and training programs with more advanced topics in data science.
These efforts will include developing a comprehensive curriculum, organizing workshops,
summer bootcamps, and inviting external experts to share insights with our research
community. These training programs are continuous efforts based on our experiences and will
cover more diverse and advanced data science topics, such as programming basics, omics data
analysis, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, statistical inference, and data ethics. In
summary, the proposed data science supplement represents a strategic effort to enhance
research capacity, address health disparities, and foster data science expertise in Hawaii's
biomedical landscape. By integrating data science support, education, and collaboration, we
aim to empower researchers, drive innovation, and make significant progress in understanding
and addressing health challenges in the state of Hawaii and beyond."

actualized its original aims to advance the conduct of ePCTs, develop and disseminate knowledge, build
investigator capacity, and catalyze stakeholder collaboration. IMPACT’s accomplishments and challenges over
its initial 5 years inform its next steps and provide rationale for its continuation. A one-year “bridge” supplement
between the current award end date of June 30, 2024 and an anticipated competitive renewal start date is
requested from July 1, 2024 thru June 30, 2025. The objective of the ""bridge"" is to maintain the essential
administrative services necessary to supervise and support 36 ongoing projects across IMPACT’s five funding
mechanisms (Pilots, Demonstration Projects, Health Care System Scholars, Real World Data Scholars, and
Career Development Awards). The administrative services to be maintained during the “bridge” year include:
tracking project performance, sustaining IMPACT’s knowledge repository and website, monitoring essential
financial functions, maintaining regulatory compliance with the centralized IRB, DSMB, clinical trials.gov, and
CROMs. Additionally, for the Long-Term Care Data Cooperative, created under a COVID related IMPACT
supplemental project, but now serving investigators conducting nursing home based clinical trials, as well as,
observational comparative effectiveness studies, the bridge is essential to keep this initiative operational.
IMPACT: IMPACT’s bold vision is to transform the delivery, quality, and outcomes of care provided to Americans
living with dementia and their CPs by accelerating the testing and adoption of evidence-based interventions
within HCS. Its accomplishments to date provide a strong foundation for this vision, but realizing it will require
more time, investment, and innovative approaches. Support for a bridge year, with an anticipated 5-year renewal
period to follow, is necessary to maintain essential functions for 36 projects in process and the Long-Term Care
Data Cooperative, and ultimately, achieve the full potential of this remarkable national infrastructure and

immunodeficiency, is one proposed mechanism driving this excess risk, and the significantly worse outcomes
observed following a cancer diagnosis compared to individuals without HIV. The immune milieu is likely a major
factor contributing to these cancer disparities among people living with HIV (PWH). However, few studies have
examined the anal tumor immune landscape by HIV status and the associated with cancer outcomes.
Chemoradiation therapy is the standard treatment for anal cancer; however, ~30% of anal cancer cases recur
and this is similar for people with and without HIV. Further, treating anal cancer recurrence comes with
detrimental side effects and morbidity. The persistence of chemoradiation therapy as the standard of care is due
the rarity of anal cancer and the difficulty of completing large, randomized clinical trials. Identification of
biomarkers that can predict at-risk individuals with unfavorable treatment outcomes is urgently needed. It is likely
that additional molecular events besides HPV are required for anal cancer development and these molecular
events are likely associated with disease recurrence. Overall, not much is known about the transcriptomic and
immunologic signatures of anal cancer treatment differences. Thus, evaluating the full transcriptomic and
immunologic profile of anal cancer tissue would be a logical first step to help elucidate when, where, and to what
extent biological aberrations facilitate treatment outcomes for anal cancer. To address the gap in the field, we
have established a clinical cohort at Vanderbilt University Medical Center that links to all electronic health record
data and tissue biorepository to maximize sample utility with enriched clinical data for this rare cancer. We will
conduct the following specific aims using pre-treatment tissues from anal cancer patients with and without HIV:
(1) examining differences in the transcriptomic profiling of anal cancer tissue by HIV status identify clinical
biomarkers for cancer outcomes using RNA-seq; (2) evaluate differences in tumor immune profiles by HIV status
and cancer outcomes using spatial transcriptomics; (3) assess transcriptomic and immunologic biomarkers in
longitudinal samples from patients who had recurrent anal cancer. Building upon our preliminary studies in PWH,
the proposed innovative study is the first to investigate the immune and transcriptomic landscape of anal cancer
recurrence. Results from this study have high translational implications as it will a) will identify at-risk individuals
who may require alternate treatment or close monitoring and care management and b) understand the biology
of anal cancer and pathogenesis. The biomarkers identified could help to improve cancer treatment targets to
inform development of future, more efficacious treatment strategies tailored to anal cancer."

This is supplemental application of an established program to investigate the regulation of the development
and homeostasis of the spine. During the first funding period, our studies demonstrated that the gene
Adgrg6, implicated in a common human spine disorder called adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, has an
essential role in maintaining spine alignment in mice. We showed that the G-protein coupled rector Adgrg6
regulates gene expression and biomechanical properties of the intervertebral discs and dense connective
tissue of the spine. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Adgrg6 stimulates cAMP signaling regulate factors
essential for homeostasis of fibrocartilaginous tissue of the spine. Our findings suggest a new hypothesis
that stimulation of cAMP signaling can decrease the onset and severity of scoliosis caused by the
loss of Adgrg6 signaling. In addition, human genetics analysis of scoliosis identified a novel variant
located in the transcriptional activation domain of the transcription factor SOX9. Significantly, targeted
disruption of this domain of Sox9 in mice caused scoliosis and dysregulation of gene expression in
fibrocartilaginous tissues of the spine. Here, we will test the hypothesis that Adgrg6 and Sox9 are
functionally linked for regulation homeostasis and alignment of the spine.
 To add breadth to our program goals, we continued a forward genetic screen to isolate a collection of spine
disorder mutant zebrafish. We recently identified two zebrafish mutants that fail to complement a novel
thoracic scoliosis phenotype, suggesting a new pathway controlling spine morphogenesis.The characterization
of this unique thoracic scoliosis phenotype will expand our knowledge into the cellular and molecular
heterogeneity of spine disorders. Here, we will test the hypothesis that thoracic scoliosis in zebrafish is
caused by a disruption of phosphatidylinositol signaling leading to defects in notochord biogenesis.
 We will test these hypotheses via studies divided into three Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1 will deepen our
mechanistic understanding of effectors of Adgrg6 signaling in the spine and test whether stimulation of cAMP
can restore homeostasis to fibrocartilaginous tissues of the spine and halt the onset and progression of
scoliosis. Specific Aim 2 will characterize the cellular and molecular causes of scoliosis in a novel Sox9
mutant mouse and use this model to test whether genetic interactions between Adgrg6 and Sox9 variants
increase the susceptibility to scoliosis. Specific Aim 3 will characterize novel thoracic scoliosis mutant
zebrafish and test a model that phosphatidylinositol signaling is essential for notochord biogenesis and spine
morphogenesis in zebrafish. Our results will provide new insights into the molecular genetics and biological
processes necessary for the development and homeostasis of the spine. These studies may provide
fundamental insights into the biological processes and pathways associated with human skeletal dysplasia
and scoliosis."
11067438,"We accrue somatic mosaicism with age in many tissues. In the blood system, this is called clonal hematopoiesis
(CH). CH is a premalignant condition in which hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) accrue 1-2 mutations among
~20 genes such as DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1. The CH clone size and the rate at which clones expand, which
are promoted by external factors such as inflammation, are strong predictors of malignant transformation of CH
into hematologic malignancies. Consistently, inflammation has been shown to promote the progression of CH to
hematologic malignancies. HIV-infected patients exhibit signatures of enhanced inflammation, such as activated
immune cells and cytokine expression, even when the patients are treated with antiretroviral therapies (ART).
Indeed, people living with HIV (PLWH) have higher incidence of CH, particularly those with ASXL1 mutations,
than HIV negative population. Notably, PLWH have a higher risk of developing hematologic malignancies such
as non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), suggesting an association between
the elevated CH prevalence among PLWH and its malignant transformation. The fact that PLWH treated with
ART have high incidence of CH raises a possibility that HIV infection promotes CH independently of viral load or
inflammation. HIV-infected human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have been found in PLWH, further
supporting the possibility that HIV infection may alter HSC function cell intrinsically to confer competitive
advantages to mutant HSCs. The objective of this project is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underpinning
the increased prevalence of CH and its transformation to malignancies among PLWH. In Aim 1, we will study
whether Asxl1 mutant HSCs expands upon HIV infection. In Aim 2, we will examine whether HIV infection
transforms Asxl1 mutant HSCs to myeloid neoplasms. Completion of this study will provide novel insights into
the effects of HIV infection on clonal expansion and subsequent transformation of Asxl1 mutant HSCs."
11065766,"Project Summary/Abstract
 The dynamic assembly of biomolecules within a living cell is vital for the spatial and temporal organization
of biological function. In forming RNA granule membraneless organelles and intermediate filaments in the cell
cytoskeleton, cells leverage the self-assembly properties of protein sequences with reduced amino acid
diversity. These low complexity protein domains have only recently come to light as essential players in these
processes. Thirty percent of the proteins coded by the human genome contain a domain of this type,
highlighting the central importance of these sequences for life. In humans, pathogenic genetic mutations and
altered expression levels, in addition to functional post-translational modifications and protein-protein
interactions, modulate the assembly processes of these proteins. Linked by the common involvement of low
complexity domain proteins, this proposal outlines two lines of research focused on a fundamental mechanistic
understanding of how the proteins that compose RNA granules and intermediate filament networks assemble
to achieve the macroscopic behavior observed in living cells. A multifaceted biophysical approach employing
cutting-edge nuclear magnetic resonance and cryo-electron microscopy will allow characterization of the
molecular structure and conformational dynamics of these proteins in biologically relevant assemblies. These
biophysical studies will be coupled with other spectroscopies, biochemical assays, and protein engineering to
form more comprehensive models of how low complexity domain proteins assemble temporally and spatially.
The results of these efforts will provide a mechanistic description of how these assembly processes and their
associated control mechanisms are modulated by point mutations and altered protein expression levels linked
to motor neuron disease, dementia, muscular dystrophy, and cancer. The in vitro work proposed here will
provide detailed and testable models regarding the function of in vivo biological assemblies involved in RNA
metabolism and the cell cytoskeleton. In the broader context of human health, the molecular characterizations
of disease-relevant low complexity domain proteins and their interacting molecular partners will provide a base
of knowledge useful for the exploration of these systems as clinical biomarkers and will also facilitate the
development of antibody and small molecule therapeutics. Beyond the specific biological systems discussed in
this proposal, the tools and methodologies employed here are expected to have applicability and impact on
investigations of the thirty percent of the proteins in the human genome that contain a low complexity domain."
11080116,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Research: Lupus nephritis (LN) is a serious complication occurring in more than 50% of patients with systemic
lupus erythematosus (SLE) and dramatically worsens the mortality in this population. Despite the significant
morbidity associated with LN, we lack biomarkers, specific medications, and a clear understanding of its
pathogenesis. The ability to accurately identify SLE patients likely to develop LN could shift the current
management paradigm from treatment to prevention and facilitate consideration of aggressive therapy to
attenuate autoimmunity prior to kidney involvement. My preliminary data show that IgG from patients with LN is
glycosylated differently from SLE patients without nephritis and when it enters podocytes it binds a lectin to
initiate signaling processes which involves the upregulation of calcium/calmodulin kinase IV (CaMK4) leading
to injury. Inhibiting CaMK4 in podocytes only, prevents immune complex deposition and nephritis in lupus
prone mice. The objective of this research proposal is to test the hypothesis that aberrantly glycosylated IgG
injures podocytes by upregulating CaMK4 in patients with LN through binding to the lectin CLEC7A in three
sets of complementary experiments. In the first the glycosylation pattern of IgG will be characterized in
patients with LN and control subjects including SLE patients without LN. In the second the signaling cascade
that is triggered by IgG in podocytes will be defined. In the third, a pilot prospective study will be performed to
determine whether measurement of CaMK4 levels in urine podocytes and in cultured podocytes exposed to
serum IgG can reliably identify patients with LN. Successful completion of the proposed work will reveal new
treatment and diagnostic tools to identify individuals with SLE destined to develop LN and follow response to
treatment.
Candidate Career Goals: My career goal is to become a successful academic physician-scientist leading a
translational research program on the pathophysiology of immune complex-mediated kidney disease with a
focus on lupus nephritis. To achieve this, I will work with experts in glycomics, immunology, pathology, SLE,
nephrology and scientific innovation. The studies outlined in this application will be critical to obtain the training,
knowledge, and expertise needed to successfully establish an independent translational research program
integrating glycomics and immunology with kidney pathology and hold a tenure-track physician-scientist
position in academic nephrology. The K99 phase will be performed under the mentorship of Dr. George Tsokos
who is a known leader in the field of SLE, with guidance from an interdisciplinary Scientific Advisory Committee
composed of experts in each of these areas specifically geared towards training in functional glycomics and
advanced immunology. With this training in hand, the proposed R00 phase research will then establish lectin-
glycan recognition systems and their signaling in lupus nephritis."
11080118,"Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) pose a significant risk to public health. Infections with MDRO are
associated with high mortality rates and healthcare costs, particularly related to hospital-acquired pneumonia.
Current approaches to control and prevent transmission of these pathogens focus primarily on clinical testing
of infectious patient isolates. This is costly, labor-intensive, and fails to account for asymptomatic carriage.
Wastewater testing can overcome many of the limitations posed by patient-based surveillance by enabling
cost-effective population-level data acquisition, which can subsequently be used to model and forecast
infectious outbreaks. To date, wastewater-based testing has been successfully used for surveillance of
pathogenic viruses, but barriers remain in applying this approach to MDRO. While pathogenic bacteria and
antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) have been detected in wastewater treatment plants, several factors
currently limit the utility and accuracy of wastewater as a marker for overall burden and diversity of antibiotic
resistance. Here, we aim to better operationalize metagenomic wastewater-based epidemiology by
understanding the dynamics of multidrug-resistant bacteria during wastewater flow, as well as the relationship
between wastewater and clinical detection of MDRO. First, we will design wastewater MDRO model systems
by constructing plug-flow reactors and testing the effects of flow parameters such as hydraulic retention time,
pH, and temperature, as well as antibiotic pressure, on the prevalence and diversity of MDRO and ARG
genotypes. This will account for dynamics in growth rates and potential ARG exchange across species along
the wastewater flow, which could significantly affect the accuracy of wastewater-based surveillance models.
These bioreactor model systems will enable future experiments testing conditions relevant to specific MDRO
species or wastewater streams. In Aim 2, we will take advantage of our ongoing longitudinal wastewater
sampling at a major hospital center and the surrounding community to correlate MDRO in wastewater with
clinical MDRO and existing patient surveillance cohorts. Through chromatin-linked metagenomics and long-
read sequencing we will elucidate phylogenetic links between MDRO in hospital and community wastewater
with infectious patient isolates, and potential differences in evolutionary patterns of MDRO in patient versus
wastewater collections. Lastly, in Aim 3 we will interrogate different approaches to wastewater-based
epidemiological modeling to estimate MDRO burden in a given community. We will contrast linear and
nonlinear additive regression models with dynamic mathematical modeling approaches. We will incorporate
wastewater flow parameters and community sociodemographics as well as molecular biomarker data, as
normalization factors to improve model accuracy. Risk assessment techniques will be applied to these
wastewater models to inform development of future public health decision making tools. If successful, the
results of this study would enable wastewater surveillance as a tool to inform targeted mitigation strategies to
prevent the spread of antibiotic multidrug-resistance."
11078028,"Advanced alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), which includes severe alcohol-associated hepatitis (sAH)
and decompensated alcohol-associated cirrhosis (DeAC), is primarily driven by alcohol use disorder and is a
significant contributor to liver-related morbidity and mortality. Presently, there are no FDA-approved therapies
for sAH or DeAC. This Data Coordinating Center (DCC) application is a part of a coordinated submission of the
Integrated Therapies for Alcohol use in Alcohol-associated Liver Disease (ITAALD) network. The network is a
continuation of the Alcoholic Hepatitis Network (AlcHepNet) funded by NIAAA. Collectively, the network will
synergize efforts and expertise to develop effective and safe therapies for advanced ALD. The ITAALD network
proposes to conduct two proof-of-concept randomized controlled trials: one targeting patients with sAH eligible
for steroid treatment and the other focusing on patients with DeAC ineligible for steroids. The DCC will serve
as a vital infrastructure facilitating the execution of these trials. Its application encompasses four overarching
objectives: (1) providing integrated administrative, clinical, and research support for the ITAALD trials; (2)
providing efficient and high-quality data management and analytical support; (3) establishing and maintaining
the network's biosample repository; and (4) expanding a research data commons established during the
previous funding cycle and enhancing its analytical capabilities. By ensuring the faithful implementation of the
ITAALD trials, the Indiana University DCC will safeguard the scientific integrity and reproducibility of the trials
outcomes. Furthermore, its biorepository and data commons will facilitate the analysis of biospecimens
generated by the network, fostering data dissemination within and beyond the ITAALD consortium."
11064635,"PROJECT SUMMARY
COVID-19 remains an ongoing global health crisis, in part due to emerging variants. Fundamental questions
remain about the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 infection drives inflammation in the lower lung, in part
due to the lack of in vitro infection models. Better understanding of variant biology and the immune pathways
involved in early SARS-CoV-2 infection could offer insights for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.
The antiviral cytokines type I interferons and their downstream effects have been implicated in COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 may inhibit or promote interferon effects in some cell types in the lung, and this may differ
between viral variants. My preliminary work shows that organoids and lung slice cultures can be used to study
these early events in SARS-CoV-2 infection and identifies macrophages as a cell type that activates the
interferon pathway in infected cultures. Thus, I propose using quantitative PCR, single-cell RNA sequencing,
and flow cytometry to study viral variants and to deeply profile the changes to viral and host gene and protein
expression during infection. I will study highly relevant cell types that can interact with each other in a similar
fashion to the in vivo lung. I will study the interferon stimulated gene response and identify the cell types in
which it is being modulated or would be good targets for therapeutic intervention. This knowledge will be critical
to our efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.
I am currently a fellow in Dr. Catherine Blish’s lab in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Stanford University
and I am in the process of being promoted to a full time Instructor position. Stanford University offers an
outstanding scientific environment, where all the resources necessary to the success of this project are made
available to me. My long-term goal is to become an independent physician-scientist, with a research focus in
respiratory viral pathogenesis. I aim to establish a research program focused on modeling established and
emerging infections in primary lung tissue with a goal of developing new treatments.
To achieve this goal, I have designed a tailored career development plan that comprises both formal and
informal training. This training will enhance my expertise in lung biology, immunology, and sequencing
analysis. Informal training in these topics will be provided by my mentor, Dr. Catherine Blish, and by the rest of
my advisory committee, Dr. Calvin Kuo, Dr. Mark Krasnow, Dr. Susan Holmes, and Dr. Ben Pinsky. With their
guidance, I will complete the proposed project, submit research manuscripts, obtain further funding, and obtain
an independent research position."
11053125,"This proposal describes the mission and strategic plans for of a Biomedical Technology Development and
Dissemination Center (RM1) entitled Center on Macromolecular Dynamics by NMR Spectroscopy
(CoMD/NMR). Located at the New York Structural Biology Center, CoMD/NMR has developed new
experimental and computational techniques in NMR spectroscopy, including both structure and dynamics
methods for both solution and solid state NMR. Here we focus mainly on spin relaxation methods, which have
already had great impact for characterizing protein and nucleic acid conformational dynamics during biological
processes including ligand recognition, allosterism, oligomerization, catalysis, and folding. The central
challenge addressed by CoMD/NMR is to break down the high activation barrier for new users to apply
advanced NMR spectroscopic and computational methods and thereby make sophisticated NMR approaches
available to a wide biological research community. To do so, CoMD/NMR addresses four primary obstacles.
(i) Because dynamics problems for biopolymers are frequently underdetermined, we develop incisive new
 experiments, pulse sequences and computational methods.
(ii) Because access to advanced NMR instruments can be a limitation for many users, we provide access
 to a range of enabling NMR instrumentation, including NMR spectrometers at multiple static magnetic
 fields, a range of modern probes, dynamic nuclear polarization, rapid-freeze-quench, high-pressure
 equipment, and field cycling relaxometry, all in a well maintained, staff supported, and multiuser
environment.
(iii) Because transfer of technology to biologists (and even to NMR spectroscopists) has been hindered by
 the complexity of the methods, and since time efficient use of the instruments is crucial, we develop
 robust efficient pipelines to facilitate experimental planning, data acquisition and analysis by non-
specialists.
(iv) Because biologists with research programs that would benefit from these methods are unaware of the
 potential, we engage in community outreach and education.
A unique strength of our program is the integration of forefront solid state NMR, solution NMR and
computational experts, and this proposal highlights synergy across these approaches. Additionally, being
situated within the NYSBC, we have excellent partnerships with X-ray diffraction, Cryo EM, and membrane
protein production technologies. Given the demanding nature of the three Technology Development Projects
(TDPs) proposed herein, we have identified a number of Technology Partnership Projects (TPPs), engaging
world leaders in aspects of NMR who have indicated their eagerness to partner with us. Technology
development proceeds most effectively when driven by exciting and challenging applications; accordingly,
CoMD/NMR will work closely with outstanding local and national investigators through Collaborative and
Service Projects (CSP), Driving Biomedical Projects (DBB) and Community Engagement (CE) activities,
including extensive training and dissemination programs. Through its various components, CoMD/NMR will
impact a diverse range of biological research with human health relatedness, including degenerative diseases,
metabolic disorders, and cancer.

The opioid crisis has touched every state in America, with 109,000 Americans dying of opioid overdose in 2022.
According to the National Center for Drug Abuse Statistics, drug overdose deaths are up 30% year-over-year
and opioids are a factor in 7 out of 10 of those overdose deaths. Naloxone is an opioid antagonist, that has
persistently served as a critical frontline countermeasure since its approval by the FDA in 1971. When
administered properly and in a timely fashion, Naloxone reverses respiratory depression caused by an opioid
overdose; it’s saved countless lives and is the most important countermeasure and effective means to combating
opioid overdoses globally. Ambulances and hospitals have Naloxone on hand, and medical staff trained to
administer it; however, a call for help or trip to the ER is often too late. At least 40% of the time, life-saving
treatment for opioid overdose is administered by an untrained bystander, often in situations of extreme stress.
The benefits of Naloxone for reversing the effects of opioid overdose have been demonstrated conclusively. The
most pressing question today then is what method of administration of Naloxone is most efficacious for untrained
bystanders. Studies show that Naloxone Auto-Injectors (NAIs) offer the best combination of pharmacokinetics,
safety, reliability, ergonomic design, and most of all rapid fail-safe injection of Naloxone. Towards this end,
Pirouette Medical has developed a novel, affordable, and proprietary NAI, based on our auto-injector platform
that can be adapted to safely deliver intramuscular Naloxone injections correctly and easily. Our NAI, REZQGO,
is a low-profile, disk-shaped, injection device with a patient-centric focus on affordability, portability, and usability.
Its intuitive design aims to allow individuals with no training to easily administer an injection to others. The NAI’s
physical design allows for simple and stress-free administration, minimizing the risk of accidental injections,
lacerations, needle sticks, or other injuries.
Pirouette is requesting an administrative supplement to address FDA feedback from our Type B pre-submission
meeting with the FDA. Pirouette has refined the project objectives, adding additional research studies. Pirouette
will add three Essential Performance Requirements to our testing regimen, conduct an in-vitro comparator study,
and evaluate drug efficacy under cold and freezing temperatures which has received little attention in the counter-
opioid market. Pirouette will also conduct an additional label development study for Human Factors. This will
inform user compliance regarding emergency services notification – a critical aspect that the FDA has been
unable to achieve with their DFL template for OTC devices. Achieving these additional milestones in Phase I will
further de-risk the project for Phase II. The additional funds will help bring to market a novel, low-cost, OTC
device that anyone could use to safely and rapidly deliver lifesaving Naloxone intramuscularly to reverse an
opioid overdose."
11063601,"Project Summary
Radiation therapy delivered at ultra-high dose rates may be becoming a breakthrough treatment option for cancer
patients. Targeting cancers with ultra-high radiation dose rates produces a FLASH effect, wherein control of
tumor growth is maintained similarly to conventional (CONV) radiation dose rates, but normal tissue toxicity is
significantly reduced. Although FLASH irradiation has been shown to evoke strong, reproducible responses
across many different organ systems (e.g., brain, lungs, gastrointestinal [GI] tract, skin) across multiple species,
some studies have shown that ultra-high-dose rate irradiation to have either no effect or detrimental effects on
normal tissue. This discrepancy is not clear; however, it likely stems from inconsistency in the physical radiation
beam and fractionation parameters. Furthermore, although previous studies have shown either no change in or
improved tumor responses from FLASH irradiation as compared with CONV dose rate irradiation, no studies
have looked beyond simple tumor growth delay when evaluating tumor responses. A more relevant analysis for
preclinical tumor responses to radiotherapy is the Tumor Control (TCD50) assay, and to date, no comparisons
between FLASH and CONV dose rate irradiation on the dose required to cure 50% of tumors (TCD50) have been
performed. The lack of comparisons of radiation types, the lack of consistency between physical radiation beam
parameters and fractionation, and the lack of accurate measurements of tumor control in previous FLASH
irradiation studies provides impetus to conduct this rigorous, high throughput, multi-institutional study to provide
confirmatory evidence of the reproducibility of FLASH effects. This proposed project will test the hypothesis that
there is an optimal set of physical beam parameters that will maximize the FLASH effect, and that under the
same dose parameters and the same physical dose, the FLASH effect dose response will be the same between
different radiation types. In order to test the hypothesis, Aim 1 will focus on determining whether radiation type
(e.g., electrons, photons, and photons) alters abdominal FLASH-mediated normal tissue-sparing effects, with
the expectation of similar responses to the different radiation types. In order to optimize the physical beam and
fractionation parameters to maximally reduce normal tissue toxicity, physical beam parameters (e.g., mean dose
rate, dose per pulse, pulse duration, overall delivery time, priming dose, and oxygen tension) as well as
fractionation will be systematically changed and tested (Aim 2). Aim 3 will focus on establishing the therapeutic
effects of FLASH dose rate irradiation mediate similar control of syngeneic, heterotopic tumors of three different
cancer cell lines using the more relevant TCD50 assay. The overarching goal of this project is to minimize side
effects for all cancer patients receiving radiation therapy, which will inevitably improve quality of life. Preventing
the post-treatment effects of radiation therapy in cancer patients so that individuals can live longer, and more
fulfilling lives is in direct alignment with the mission of the National Cancer Institute."
11131347,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Breast cancer brain metastasis (BCBM) is a major clinical challenge due to their poor response to therapeutic
options. Although the survival rate of breast cancer (BC) patients has improved, the incidence of BCBM is
increasing with recent advance in diagnostic imaging and systemic therapy, and long-term survival rates for
these patients are unacceptably low, urgently calling for new interventions. Oncolytic herpes simplex virus-1
(oHSV) therapy is the most advanced virotherapy as approved by FDA for melanoma in the U.S. and
conditionally for glioblastoma in Japan. However, accumulating clinical data is revealing that oHSV treatment
very weakly induces a systemic anti-tumor immune response which is often offset by the immunosuppressive
tumor microenvironment (TME). Thus, mechanistic identification of the anti-viral resistance is a key to maximize
its therapeutic efficacy. In BCBM, we observed that oHSV therapy induces insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2)
expression and secretion, sustaining pro-inflammatory neutrophils in the TME and polarization change to pro-
tumoral neutrophils, hampering the virus propagation and discouraging the development of a strong adaptive
anti-tumoral immune response. Additionally, we found that infiltrated neutrophils by oHSV therapy induces
neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation (also called “NETosis”), hampering the therapeutic efficiency of
Viro-Immunotherapy. The overarching goal of this application is to identify the ultimate cause of the poor clinical
response of cancer patients to oHSV therapy, and develop a more effective novel viral immunotherapy for
incurable BCBM. We aim to achieve our goal by deciphering anti-viral resistance mechanism behind oHSV-
induced IGF2/microglia/neutrophil axis, and evaluating therapeutic benefit of IGF2 inhibition and NET
degradation on oHSV therapy. To compromise oHSV-induced IGF2 and its signaling pathways, we generated a
novel IGF2-scavanging oHSV (oHSV-D11mt) and will investigate the therapeutic benefit when combined with
radiation therapy, which has also been hindered by IGF2, neutrophil infiltration and NETosis. We also generated
actin resistant DNase1-expressing oHSV (oHSV-haDNase1) to degrade the NETs for enhanced virus
propagation and access to infiltrating cytotoxic lymphocytes. To test these hypotheses, we will investigate the
contradictory roles of IGF2 in virus clearance and tumor progression (Aim 1), evaluate therapeutic potential of
IGF2-scavenging oHSV-D11mt in combination with radiotherapy (Aim 2), and assess the preclinical efficacy of
NET-mitigating oHSV-haDNase1 (Aim 3). The successful completion of this proposed study is expected to unveil
the role of neutrophil infiltration and NET formation induced by oHSV therapy, and elucidate why oHSV therapy
was not as successful as viral immunotherapy as expected. Therefore, it will accelerate the translation of oHSV
therapy into an efficient and improved treatment modality for the patients with BCBM."

xenograft (PDX) models of cancers originated from the breast, pancreas, colon, liver, lung, and other advanced
peritoneal cancers. These PDXs will be made from >60% of patients from underrepresented populations which
our safety-net clinical system serves. To develop such a large number and diverse set of PDXs, we have enlisted
the support of a set of surgeons that specialize in each cancer type. Once extracted, the tumors are immediately
provided to the U4HELPP PDX Core which functions to propagate, distribute, and cryopreserve them.
Successfully generated PDXs will be subjected to genomic characterization and quantitative ancestral profiling
by the U4HELPP Bioinformatics Core so that we can better understand how ancestry contributes to genetics
and responses to targeted therapeutics. The PDXs will be provided to two Research Projects, that will focus on
either pancreatic cancer or breast cancer. The Pancreatic Cancer project will generate large-scale proteomics
insights from over 200 PDXs to refine subtypes of the disease and identify more effective therapeutics from Black
and White patients. The Breast Cancer project will utilize 20 PDXs that are Basal-like breast cancers,
characterize their metastatic profiles, define proteogenomic pathways that mediate metastatic growth, and target
metastases with synergistic investigational new drug combinations. The information from these PDXs and
Projects will be shared with the U4HELPP Pilot Projects and Trans-Network Activities Core which will award Pilot
Project grants to utilize the PDXs generated by us and our partnering PDXNet institutions. All of the PDXs and
insights gained will be shared with the NCI with the goal of reducing cancer disparities. Through this team effort
we are confident that we will be able to develop these unique resources and generate significant preliminary
data that will support investigator initiated clinical trials at the Massey Cancer Center."

The Candidate is an assistant professor in pediatrics and a young physician-scientist dedicated
to developing an academic career focused on investigating the intersection of inflammation and
thrombosis through the study of the mechanisms by which inflammation promotes platelet
hyperreactivity. With a strong background in inflammation, megakaryocyte, and platelet biology,
the candidate looks to develop new expertise in autophagy and metabolism to determine their
contribution to platelet hyperreactivity and thrombosis. The Career Development Plan described
in the proposal outlines 2 years of mentored training, including technical skill training and career
development activities, to promote the successful transition to independence and future funding.
The Candidate’s Mentors and Co-Mentors have proven track-records of excellent translational
research productivity and successful mentorship. The Research Plan: Inflammation contributes
to the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and promotes platelet hyperreactivity and
thrombosis in older humans (aging) and patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The thrombotic
events experienced by these groups are characterized by platelet-rich arterial clots denoting that
platelet hyperreactivity is central for the elevated morbidity and mortality in these populations.
The central hypothesis of this application is that chronic inflammation promotes platelet
hyperreactivity and thrombosis through the reprogramming of key platelet metabolic pathways.
The work proposed in this application is set to elucidate the mechanisms by which chronic
inflammation promotes platelet hyperreactivity through dysregulation of critical metabolic
regulators of platelet function such as autophagy (aim 1) and the pentose phosphate pathway
(PPP, [aim 2]) in older humans and in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (aim3). For this purpose,
I have integrated multidisciplinary mentoring and advisory teams of world-known experts in
autophagy (Andrew Thorburn, Ph.D.), metabolomics (Angelo D’Alessandro Ph.D.), and platelet
biology (Matthew Rondina, MD) to guide the successful completion of the proposed work. The
mentoring, skills, and tools developed throughout the K99 phase of this award will lay down a
solid foundation to establish my independent research program focused on the study of the
platelet metabolic determinants for hyperreactivity and thrombosis. Finally, and most important,
discoveries from our research have the potential to improve the care and outcomes not only for
older individuals and patients with RA but also children with chronic inflammatory conditions such
as Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) and sickle cell disease."

and will yield novel capabilities and information for AAI outcome assessment and intervention development.
 Our team has developed and tested an innovative platform that incorporates wearable, wireless sensors
that will simultaneously gather physiological data (i.e., activity, heart rate/variability, respiratory rate,
electrodermal activity) from both humans and dogs involved in AAIs. This novel system will be combined
with psychological (i.e., distress, well- being) and symptom data (i.e., pain, fatigue) collected from the
patient and dog handler. Tasks will include qualitative methods (i.e., focus groups) to elucidate first
stakeholder-informed, standardized AAI protocols. Conducting focus groups including patients, handlers,
and providers will provide information to optimize a structured AAI protocol that can be delivered with a
high level of intervention fidelity, lead to beneficial patient outcomes, and provide controlled settings for
objective, continuous measurement of both patient and dog physiology and behavior.
 This work will contribute new capabilities for the in vivo study of the human-animal bond in AAI especially
in oncology and PTSD settings, and new knowledge about the types of interactions that promote, or result
from, stronger human-animal bonds and the role they play in therapeutic outcomes. The populations are
large: the U.S. has had 1.3M-1.8M new cancer patients every year since 1999, and it is estimated that 23%
of the 2.7M veterans suffer from PTSD. The capabilities and knowledge derived from this project will afford
new ways to directly improve the lives of millions of Americans.
RELEVANCE (See instructions):
The proposed research is relevant to NCI as it will contribute new knowledge and tools that illuminate and
enable novel study of the role of Animal-Assisted Interventions (AAI) in oncology treatment. Existing
knowledge strongly suggests AAI can improve wellbeing for oncology patients, but structuring AAI sessions
to promote improved outcomes has been a process of trial-and-error. The novel tools proposed here will
enable new capabilities for customizing AAI for oncology treatment and quantitatively evaluating outcomes."
11063443,"The overarching objective of this project is to optimize and personalize breast cancer screening by advancing
artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. Breast cancer is a major global health concern. Early diagnosis is key
to reducing disease burden and mortality, making breast cancer one of the few cancers regularly screened
for asymptomatic women. Accordingly, the American Cancer Society recommends annual screening for
women age 40 and older, leading to a substantial number of scans conducted yearly. Mammography, with
an estimated 39 million annual screenings in the US, is the primary breast cancer screening method. Digital
Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) or 3D mammography has become a routine screening method for its 3D tissue
view, improving cancer detection. However, the complexity of mammograms, the high radiologist workload,
and the low prevalence of breast cancer in screening examinations challenges radiologists’ performance and
increases the risk of false positives and missed diagnoses. Computer-aided detection (CAD) systems have
been introduced to assist radiologists, but suffer from high false positives, straining healthcare systems and
causing needless worry for patients. Recent advancements in deep learning (DL), a subfield of AI, have
enabled the development of new CAD (AI-CAD) systems that can transform clinical decision-making.
However, AI-CAD faces limitations when dealing with DBT images. Current DL models often rely on just
current scans, lack real-world generalizability, and struggle with the high-resolution DICOM format and
complexity of DBT images. To enhance breast cancer screening, we propose a more realistic AI-CAD
system, which mimics a radiologist's approach to breast cancer screening by comparing current and prior
mammograms, incorporating clinical risk factors, and accounting for image configuration variations.
Furthermore, we consider practical implementation of such a system for clinical use.
This project aims to achieve its main objective through three specific goals: i) to achieve a robust,
explainable, and efficient representation of DBT images for cancer identification by employing self attention
graph learning models; ii) to develop a multimodal longitudinal learning model for integrating history images
and clinical information, thereby creating a more human-like intelligence CAD system to improve breast
cancer detection and localization; iii) to practically implement AI-CAD for clinical use by utilizing expert-in-
the-loop continual learning to ensure model adaptivity to changes in practice, and an algorithm-hardware
codesign model compression to ensure computational feasibility. Furthermore, the project will provide a
comprehensive DBT database. In this project both publicly available and in-house DBT images will be
used to train, evaluate, and validate the proposed models. Due to the widespread use of mammography
and critical importance of early detection in patient survival, successful completion of this project will
provide a means to transform breast cancer diagnosis through greater accuracy, thereby improving patient
outcomes and reducing healthcare cost. The innovative developed algorithms will contribute to advancing
DL especially in biomedical image analyses and can be used for analyzing other 3D biomedical images
such as CT scans and brain MRI."
11063449,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):
Early detection of abdominal cancers is notoriously challenging. Symptoms are often unclear, and tumors
are located deep inside the body, making regular physical checks less effective. Routine screenings aren't
widely advised for those without a high-risk profile, delaying early identification. Even with advanced
imaging like CT or MRI, small tumors may go unnoticed, and interpreting these scans accurately requires
specialized expertise, with a risk of error. Biopsies can confirm diagnosis but are invasive and risky.
Moreover, the high cost of thorough screenings and the limited reliability of tumor markers complicate the
situation further. In the realm of early diagnosis, Artificial Intelligence (Al) technology, emerges as a
beacon of hope, due to its power in automatically identifying key features for early diagnosis by learning
from large amounts of data. However, the full potential of Al in abdominal cancer diagnostics is hindered
by significant limitations, including: 1) small training data, 2) obscurity and vulnerability of Al reasoning, 2)
data privacy concerns, and 3) a communication gap between medical experts and Al models. To address
these challenges, this project aims at a computational framework that leverages the Al visual explanation
as a channel to guide Al to reason and communicate with medical practitioners. The proposed framework
will: 1) improve sample efficiency by visual explanation supervision with cancer imaging annotations, 2)
consolidate Al's knowledge on reasoning across multi-institutions' data with privacy preservation, and 3)
prompt Al prediction with human explanation and accelerate Al training with Al-guided explanation
annotation. Our introduction of efficient, explainable Al techniques aims to reduce overdiagnosis and
unnecessary monitoring, especially in high-risk groups. These technologies are crucial for assessing
tumor responses to cancer treatments, offering widespread benefits. Our framework will supply
open-source tools and datasets for Al researchers to test explanation quality, understand model logic, and
enhance model applicability and human-Al collaboration, pushing the boundaries of artificial general
intelligence. An interactive system will allow experts to easily navigate and influence Al decision-making,
making this framework an excellent resource for teaching Al concepts and showing students how different
aspects integrate."
11063493,"Although ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) has been used to detect sources of
 cardiovascular mortality (e.g., hypertension and abnormal BP rhythms) for over six decades, current
 ABPM devices are still not yet widely adopted by the general population. Cuffless ABPM approaches are
clearly more user-friendly, but have yet to achieve acceptable accuracy. The objective of this SCH project
 is to create a paradigm-shifting cuffless ABPM device based on biomechanics-guided wireless ultrasound
 e-tattoo sensors. The specific aims include (1) designing an ultra-low-power and millimeter-size
 application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) capable of duplex mode ultrasound to be used in a soft,
 wrist-laminated, wireless ultrasound e-tattoo (WUET) for continuous monitoring of absolute anatomic and
 fluidic features. (2) establishing a fundamental biomechanics model to extract BP using the
 aforementioned hemodynamic measurables. (3) pilot clinical validation of the WUET on patients with
 arterial catheter insertions in Dell Children's Medical Center using SickbayTM virtual patient monitors for
 simultaneous data acquisition. The four PIs bring together well-established expertise in analog/mixed
 ASIC design (Jia), low-power wireless e-tattoos (Lu), cardiovascular biomechanics (Han), and pediatric
cardiac intensive care (Mery) to synergistically tackle this grand challenge. This approach fundamentally
differs from previous cuffless continuous noninvasive BP (cNIBP) sensing methods that rely on traditional
 wearables modalities only capable of measuring relative and indirect hemodynamic features. Such
 modalities then require empirical (e.g., machine learning) models for cNIBP despite inherent inaccuracies
and constant calibration requirements caused by poor understanding of the underlying mechanisms and
bias to training data. While ultrasound can capture the absolute metrics required for biomechanics-based
 models, state-of-the-art wearable ultrasound sensors are still constrained by bulky back-end control and
 data acquisition systems. The proposed analog-edge-computing of hemodynamic feature extraction
 enables true wireless implementation by dramatically reducing power consumption and sensor size. Our
 preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of anatomic and Doppler-based feature extraction purely
 using analog circuitry. The proposed ABPM WUET can ultimately replace invasive arterial catheters in
 clinical spaces while also enabling ambulatory monitoring of the broader outpatient populations.
RELEVANCE (See instructions):
 Cardiovascular disease is most effectively treated through early diagnosis and preventative measures,
 and this project provides a new method of cuffless blood pressure monitoring that is still accessible and
 patient-friendly. A greater fundamental understanding of vascular biomechanics and a new wearable
 vascular measurement modality will be established. This project is committed to NHLBI's mission for
 advancing translational research, with focuses on real patient usability in clinical and outpatient settings."
11063494,"Early prediction and timely decision-making of acute diseases are critical to enabling early intervention and
improving clinical outcomes (for example, a sepsis patient may benefit from a 4% higher chance of survival
if diagnosed 1 hour earlier). Developing machine learning (ML) models for clinical decision-making on
Electronic Health Records (EHRs) presents several significant challenges: 1) existing models are trained
mostly on EHR data from intensive care units (ICUs), which are not generalizable for sepsis onsets in
emergency rooms and hospital wards; 2) most existing tools simply output prediction result as a risk score,
without sufficient explanation or confidence interval for it, which is not trustworthy for physicians; 3) existing
systems often ignore the human workflow by neither providing actionable insights to physicians nor
enabling interactive explorations from physicians, which limits their clinical usages.
To address these challenges, we propose a Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HCAI) system to
collaborate with human domain experts in the high-stake and high-uncertainty decision-making process.
Specifically, we 1) create a deidentified database with complete visits and long-term EHR history for
patients with sepsis risk; 2) develop early sepsis risk prediction models with uncertainty quantification and
active sensing; 3) design and implement a physician-centered AI prediction module and user interface for
early sepsis human-AI decision making; and 4) design and conduct controlled usability evaluations to
quantitatively and qualitatively measure the clinical outcome and user satisfaction.
This project integrates human-AI collaboration design, novel ML algorithms, and data visualization tools for
improving early prediction and decision-making for sepsis, which hold great promise for leading new
insights into human-AI systems for clinical decision support.
RELEVANCE (See instructions):
Sepsis, which can be caused by bacteria, fungi, or in the case of COVID-19, a virus, is a life-threatening
condition with high mortality rates and expensive treatment costs. This project will develop a physician-
centered deep-learning algorithm to predict sepsis onset and a user interface for effective human-AI
collaboration. As a result, this work relates to the mission of the NIAID and will make a relevant public
health impact by delivering early, life-saving care to the bedside of sepsis patients, and will lead to a useful
clinical decision support tool for physicians."
