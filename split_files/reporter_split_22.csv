Tourette Syndrome (TS) is a chronic, childhood-onset neurodevelopmental disorder that affects 1-3% of people
and is associated with adverse functional impacts. TS is characterized by tics, which are involuntary, repetitive
movements and vocalizations. A current challenge in clinical care for TS is the lack of objective, quantitative,
scalable tools to measure tics for the purposes of diagnosis and symptom severity monitoring. The overall
objective of the proposed study is to use video-based methods in a large, diverse community sample to inform
quantitative and automated phenotyping of tics. This study builds on prior work, including: 1) video-based
observational methods with trained human raters to quantify tics for research purposes, 2) computer vision and
machine learning techniques for movement analysis and medical diagnostic aids, and 3) preliminary data
indicating supervised learning methods can be used to automate detection of eye tics with high accuracy. In
Aim 1, videos and clinical data from N = 1,000 individuals with tics will be collected using remote and
internet-based methods. A deep phenotyping approach will be used to quantitatively describe the phenotypic
spectrum of observable motor and vocal tics, empirically derive tic severity benchmarks, and identify patient
subgroups. In Aim 2, our computer vision team will apply supervised machine learning methods to Aim 1 data
to create an algorithm capable of detecting the most common tics. Aim 3 will prospectively test the Aim 2
algorithm in N = 60 patients who completed TS treatment in a separate clinical trial to establish the algorithm’s
sensitivity to change and convergent validity with current gold-standard tic severity measurement. This project
will enable us, for the first time, to quantify the spectrum of observable tics in a large community sample,
knowledge that will have immediate clinical relevance for diagnostic decision making and patient education.
Aim 2 will yield a computer algorithm capable of autonomously quantifying the most common motor tics, a
critical next step toward developing accurate, clinically valid, and scalable assessments for tic screening,
diagnosis, treatment decision making, and symptom quantification in clinical trials."
10848196,"Background: Family caregivers play a central role during a Veteran’s critical care (medical care for a life-
threatening illness or injury) hospitalization and survivorship. Yet, up to 73% of caregivers experience anxiety
and 97% experience depression during a critically ill patient’s hospital stay, compromising their engagement
with the clinical team, their readiness for the survivor journey and can impair patient recovery. Addressing
family caregiver needs, including informational and emotional processing, social support and self-care, during
key moments early in a family’s crisis may moderate the development of caregiver psychological distress.
Significance/Impact: Supporting family caregivers is important for promoting caregiver well-being,
engagement with the clinical team and Veteran outcomes during hospitalization and survivorship. This work
addresses several VA priorities. Specifically, VA HRO values support family-centered approaches to care and
the MISSION Act has increased supportive resources for Veteran family caregivers. While formal (paid)
caregivers are commonly aware of and access these resources, informal caregivers—such as family
caregivers of critically ill Veterans—are a missed yet vulnerable population. VA virtual care technologies (an
HSR&D priority) may be an effective way to provide these caregivers with psychosocial resources to mitigate
psychological distress and link them to VA programs that support caregivers and Veterans after
hospitalization. In addition to helping family caregivers, this work supports Dr. Blok’s career goal of becoming
a leading nurse researcher and implementation scientist in the VA, with a program of research in Veteran and
family-facing intervention and implementation program design.
Innovation: This research will create an intervention for family caregivers, with family caregivers, by using
visual participatory methods, such as PhotoVoice, to understand support needs, and user-centered design
principles to co-design an intervention with Veteran family caregivers to meet these needs. Drawing on Crisis
Theory principles, this work extends beyond providing medical information, to address ‘crisis-solving’ needs,
including information processing, emotional processing, social support and self-care, essential elements for
reducing anxiety and distress. Finally, available VA virtual care technologies will be used to deliver
intervention components to caregivers in crisis, which is a new application of these resources.
Specific Aims: Aim 1. Identify how family caregiver experiences and needs evolve while their critically ill
Veteran is hospitalized. Aim 2. Design a psychosocial support intervention with family caregivers, for family
caregivers. Aim 3. Test the feasibility of a psychosocial support intervention for family caregivers.
Methodology: In years 1-3, advanced qualitative and participatory research methods will be used to examine
common key moments in the caregiver experience that can lead to distress and engage family caregivers and
clinical team members in user-centered design to build psychosocial intervention components to meet
caregiver needs during these key moments. In years 4 and 5, a single-arm pilot study of 30 family caregivers
of hospitalized critically ill Veterans will be conducted to test the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention,
as well as the tools used to collect quantitative and qualitative outcome measures.
Implementation/Next Steps: Dr. Blok will receive mentorship and formal training in (1) advanced qualitative
methods, (2) user-centered design, (3) development and adaptation of surveys, and (4) conducting clinical
trials in complex settings. Additionally, she will build upon her work by submitting research proposals to (1)
understand the persistence of factors impacting psychological distress after critical care hospitalization and (2)
test the intervention piloted in Aim 3 through an effectiveness-implementation trial. National partners will be
engaged throughout the award to provide opportunities to disseminate and utilize her findings."

The geroscience approach of modulating fundamental aging mechanisms holds great promise for generating
effective new therapeutics for complex, multifactorial conditions of aging such as frailty which contribute so much
to functional decline, disability, and loss of independence in older adults. The frailty syndrome is conceptualized
as a condition of progressive functional decline and increased vulnerability to stressors resulting from decreased
functional reserve. The pathophysiology of frailty is complex and not well understood, but is generally thought to
prominently include cellular energy production deficits along with chronic inflammation and immune dysfunction.
Dietary restriction and fasting, interventions closely linked to fundamental mechanisms of aging, promote the
endogenous production of ketone bodies as a means of supplying fat-derived energy to tissues. New advances
in understanding the biological activities of the ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) suggest that both
energy production and signaling activities of BHB may have a mechanistic role in modulating aging, and may be
particularly relevant to the pathophysiology of frailty. Ketone esters have recently emerged as a pharmacological
means of delivering ketone bodies. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team of experts in geroscience,
geriatrics and frailty, ketone body biology, immunosenescence, and ketone body-related clinical trials to carry
out a multi-site, proof-of-concept Phase 2a clinical trial of a ketone ester (KE) targeting frailty in prefrail and mildly
frail older adults. TAKEOFF is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, 12-week study of ketone ester vs.
matched placebo. Aim 1 will test if muscle strength and other clinical frailty- and aging-related outcomes improve
with KE. Aim 2 will determine the safety and tolerability of daily KE in broadly representative pre-frail and frail
older adults. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that ketone ester impacts the aging immune system, skeletal muscle,
and biomarkers of aging via detailed mechanistic immunophenotyping, muscle metabolism, and biomarker
studies that leverage the strong specialist expertise at the participating institutions. Altogether, this translational
effort will provide crucial information on the safety and efficacy of interventions increasingly being used by the
public despite a paucity of data, and with potential to impact important aging-related conditions to improve the
health and independence of older adults."

10831375,"PROJECT ABSTRACT:
When the lives of miners are in danger, or the workers self-escape from a hazardous environment is impeded,
mine emergency response systems must respond and deploy rapidly. The post-accident mine environment may
significantly increase the mission’s risk and the stress on the rescue team. Any delays in the rescue mission can
cost the lives of the trapped miners. Self-escape and mine rescue heavily rely on each individual’s level of skills
and preparedness to make the correct decision. Introducing an intelligent system to assist mine personnel and
mine rescue team during an emergency will significantly improve the likelihood of success while reducing the
risks to miners. This proposed research is an interdisciplinary collaboration to improve self-escape and mine
rescue through innovative robotic and autonomy solutions. This project brings together a diverse and highly
reputable group of faculty from three mining schools (New Mexico Tech, University of Arizona, University of
Nevada, Reno), researchers from NIOSH-Mining, Sandia National Lab, NASA, stakeholders, mining companies,
and technology developers/licensors. The project goals were developed to address key NIOSH-NORA mining
intermediate goal “to improve mine disaster response (objective 2).” We propose to design and demonstrate
intelligent mine evacuation and mine rescue systems for underground mining applications. First, we will design
a multi-agent robotic system to assist mine rescuers during rescue missions in underground mines. The multi-
agent system is a combination of ground and aerial vehicles with complementary capabilities to complete a
rescue mission. Second, we will develop algorithms to assist miners to find the safest and fast paths to safety.
The algorithm relies on the existing communication and tracking system incorporating human factors into the
simulation models. Third, we will design a new communication system to optimize locating, tracking, and
communicating with trapped miners and provide AI-assisted self-escape when possible. Finally, we will create
and deliver technologically driven hybrid training products to improve self-escape and mine rescue that
incorporate the tools and strategies developed in this project. The ‘hybrid’ modules that serve as a bridge
between traditional tabletop activities, hands-on training activities and full-scale synthetic learning environments.
This effort will also be focusing on developing expertise in the area of mine health and safety by supporting eight
Ph.D. and five M.S. students. The research to practice (r2p) plan for this research include dissemination of the
project findings through publications, training, and workshops, collaboration with industry partner to technology
development and enhancement, and technology implementation with collaboration of NIOSH-Mining and
stakeholders. The intermediate outcomes of the proposed work include adoption of the developed technologies
and strategies through collaboration with partner mining operations, and technology developer/licensor, new
competency-based training products that incorporate project results, as well as publications and patents. The
end-goal of the project is to introduce new autonomous solutions to improve self-escape and mine rescue."

Large-scale genetic studies of major depression (MD) are primarily comprised of European descent cohorts.
Broadening diversity of study populations will empower genomic research by expanding discovery and
enhancing our understanding of the role of human genomic variation in disease etiology. This proposal
supports the formation of the Cross-Population Working Group on Genes and Environment in Major
Depression (POP-GEM) with the goal of characterizing genomic variants associated with MD across
ancestries. The overarching goal of this proposal is to leverage large-scale global collaborations to assemble
extant and emerging datasets from diverse ancestries in order to perform the largest and most inclusive cross-
population GWAS of MD to date (>70,000 diverse ancestry cases Phase I and >200,000 diverse ancestry
cases Phase II). We will delineate the genetic architecture of MD across populations, facilitating fine-mapping
of causal variants, improved polygenic risk profiling for all, examination of sex differences, and assessing
direction of causation between major comorbid traits and disorders. This application presents an exceptional
opportunity to gain insight into the etiology of MD and comorbid disease in groups underrepresented in prior
genetics research. Our broad goal is to address the major limitations in our knowledge of the genetic and
environmental risk architecture of MD in persons of diverse ancestries and lead to improvement in etiologic
understanding, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment in all populations."
10898007,"Project Abstract/Summary:
Aggregates of amyloid peptides, such as amyloid fibrils are highly cytotoxic, as exemplified by the role of amyloid
b (Aβ) in Alzheimer's disease. To maintain a healthy proteome, a number of proteases target the monomeric
form of amyloid peptides because this form fuels both seeding and elongation of amyloid fibrils. Insulin degrading
enzyme (IDE) is a 110 kDa metalloprotease that degrades various amyloid peptides, including Aβ and three
blood glucose-regulating hormones, namely insulin, amylin, and glucagon. Defects in IDE alter the progression
of type 2 diabetes mellitus and Alzheimer’s disease in animal models and are linked to these diseases in humans.
IDE inhibitors can control blood glucose level in mice and hold promise for treating diabetes. One of the key
steps in the IDE catalytic cycle is the selective recognition and unfolding of amyloid peptides prior to degradation.
Our premise is that the understudied conformational dynamics of IDE provide the mechanical basis for the
unfolding of peptide substrates. Thus, we can leverage our understanding of these processes to selectively
modulate the activity of IDE towards specific substrates. Our long-term goals are to elucidate the molecular
details of how IDE selectively recognizes amyloid peptides and utilize this knowledge to develop novel IDE-
based therapies to improve the human condition. Toward this goal, we have integrated ensemble structural
determination and solution-based methods to show that IDE is a member of the chamber-containing protease,
aka cryptidase, family that uses a sizable catalytic chamber to engulf monomeric amyloid peptides. We have
also generated a working model that explains how IDE uses two key conformational switches to selectively
degrade amyloid peptides. Our objectives for this application are to determine key unsolved conformational
states and probe the conformational dynamics of IDE during the catalytic cycle by applying state-of-art integrative
structural approaches. We will then combine MD simulation and screening to identify strategies to modulate the
catalytic activity and selectivity of IDE. Our research rationale is that a deeper understanding of the regulation
and functions of IDE will allow us to modulate its activity through engineering or novel small molecules and
ultimately facilitate the design of IDE-based therapies to combat proteostatic imbalances. We will use time-
resolved cryoEM and SAXS to understand the structural basis for substrate recognition during the key time
window when IDE first encounters substrate in combination with advanced cryoEM image processing algorithms
and MD simulation to address how IDE motions can unfold physiologically relevant substrates. We will apply the
knowledge gained from the substrate recognition and unfolding studies to develop a screening strategy to identify
methods to selectively modulate the degradation of Ab by IDE. This work will significantly enhance our
understanding of the IDE catalytic cycle by defining key conformational states under physiologically relevant
conditions and offer a platform to merge integrative structural analysis and MD simulation towards the discovery
of innovative enzyme modulating strategies as the developmental foundation of novel IDE-based therapies."

Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common solid tumors in women world-wide. Loss-of-function mutations in
the DNA repair gene, BRCA1, is among the most clinically relevant factors that increases BC incidence. Despite
such a strong link with BC, not every woman with a BRCA1 mutation will develop BC. Therefore, identification
of cooperating risk factors, such as life history events, that initiate tumor development will enable development
of biomarkers for early detection, prevention and potentially targeted treatments. The dos Santos lab has found
that whole body changes resulting from urinary tract infection (UTI) remodel the transcriptome of mammary
epithelial cells (MECs) and the tissue microenvironment. Therefore, we hypothesize that UTI is a life history
event that promotes BC incidence. Specifically, I hypothesize that UTI induces alterations to MECs and modifies
mammary stromal and immune cells in such a way that tumors in Brca1 knockout mice will develop faster. I have
evaluated changes to mammary tissue with single cell RNA-sequencing and will further investigate these findings
through the proposed aims using multi-color flow cytometry, histopathology, transplantation experiments and
organoid studies. Overall, the significance of this proposed research is to: i) better understand mechanisms of
tumor initiation and early progression in Brca1-BC, ii) identify immune-suppressive cellular changes in mammary
tissue resulting from UTI, and iii) provide justification for UTI as a novel BC risk factor in patients with BRCA1
mutations. The outcome of these approaches will provide a deeper mechanistic understanding of how a specific
life history event modulates the responsiveness of MECs to cancer promoting signals. Additionally, this proposal
will provide a novel appreciation of the role of Brca1, and the effects of systemic signals produced after infection,
in modifying mammary stromal and immune cell function."
10954705,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis is a leading cause of stroke, long-term disability, and death.
Current assessment of ICA stenosis is based on estimation of % stenosis via duplex ultrasound (DUS)
or cross-sectional angiography. Landmark studies suggested that asymptomatic patients with stenotic
lesions >60% should be considered for carotid endarterectomy (CEA), however intervention is often
reserved to those with stenotic lesions >80% and/or vulnerable plaques. The % stenosis alone is a poor
surrogate for plaque vulnerability and does not identify patients at high risk for stroke. Moreover,
stenosis severity does not account for indices such as plaque burden, wall shear stress (WSS),
pressure gradients, and cerebral flow compensation which are key to understand stroke risk. Optimal
patient selection for carotid artery revascularization, particularly in asymptomatic patients, remains a
significant clinical need.
 We have developed a workflow based on patient-specific CFD modeling informed by MRI data,
and demonstrated that patients with similar degrees of stenosis (> 70% stenosis diagnosed using DUS
and/or cross sectional angiography) have differences in pressure gradients and cerebral blood flow.
These results suggest again that anatomic and flow data alone fail to identify markers for stroke risk
and patients who would benefit from carotid revascularization. In this proposal, we will leverage MRI to
characterize plaque composition and CFD modeling to assess hemodynamic loads on the plaque to
thus provide a better assessment of vulnerability. We hypothesize that patients with similar degrees
of asymptomatic high-grade (> 70% stenosis on DUS velocity criteria) extracranial ICA stenosis
will have differences in plaque morphology, hemodynamics stresses on the plaque, and
cerebral perfusion that are independent of their DUS velocity profiles and stenosis severity. To
test this hypothesis, we will pursue the following Aims: 1) To determine plaque composition using T1/T2
MRI, hemodynamic loads on the plaque and cerebral flow using MRI-calibrated CFD workflows in a
cohort of patients with asymptomatic high grade ICA stenosis who have similar velocity profiles on
DUS. 2) To characterize the degree of variability in the above metrics, and therefore test the validity of
our hypothesis. 3) In a subset of the patients who are chosen for CEA, we will investigate the
differences in pre-operative and post-operative hemodynamic to assess the efficacy of the surgical
repair."

10817688,"Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are responsible for a large public health burden with over half of women
experiencing a UTI during their lifetime. These infections, primarily in women, older adults, and those with
underlying conditions such as diabetes, are responsible for over $3.5 billion in health care costs annually in the
USA alone. The majority of UTIs are caused by uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) and are readily treated with
antibiotics. However, global rise of antibiotic resistance amongst bacterial pathogens threatens the utility of the
current standard of care. Furthermore, up to 30% of UPEC UTIs will have recurrence within 6 months of treatment
due to intracellular UPEC reservoirs that are hidden from antibiotic therapy. Because of these reasons,
alternatives to antibiotics are desperately needed. Bacteriophages (phage), viruses that infect bacteria, have
long been hypothesized as a treatment for bacterial infection, predating the use of antibiotics by over a quarter
of a century. Unfortunately, like antibiotics, bacteria can become resistant to phage. Preliminary work has
identified several phage-resistant UPEC harboring mutations in lipopolysaccharide (LPS). These bacteria,
although capable of evading phage, are poorer at growing in urine and at colonizing the bladder than their
parental strains. The exact reason(s) for these fitness defects, however, are unknown. This work also aims to
assess the utility of phage for treating intracellular UPEC reservoirs, which are untouched by antibiotic therapy,
and which lead to UTI recurrence. Published and preliminary data suggests phage can interact and be
internalized by bladder cells, although no group has tested the ability of phage to reduce intracellular UPEC
burdens. Taken together, this preliminary data supports the hypothesis that phage therapy, through driving
phage resistance that leaves bacteria less fit, and through phage interactions with the bladder, will be effective
at treating both intracellular and extracellular UTIs. This hypothesis will be investigated by the following specific
aims: 1) Identify mechanisms underlying decreased growth in urine and poor colonization of the murine bladder
in phage resistant (LPS mutant) UPEC, 2) Characterize phage binding and internalization by the uroepithelium,
reduction of intracellular reservoirs, and stimulation of bladder immune responses. In investigating these aims,
several innovative tools such as primary bladder cell-derived organoids, super-resolution microscopy, and in vivo
mouse models of disease and phage therapy will be used. This proposal will provide the candidate with training
in UTI animal models, advanced microscopy techniques, protein isolation, and bladder organoid models. This
training, along with excellent mentorship and career development goals, will provide the candidate with the
necessary skills for an independent research career studying novel translational treatments for infectious
disease. This training will take place at Baylor College of Medicine under the mentorship of leaders in the fields
of antimicrobial resistance, phage therapy, and host-pathogen interactions. Taken together, this research will
provide the information necessary to translate UTI phage therapy from the bench into the clinic."

Abnormalities in right ventricle (RV) development are associated with congenital heart disease (CHD).
Although developmental origins and initial specification of the RV has been a subject of intense study, critical
molecular pathways involved in subsequent RV growth and expansion at later stages following chamber
formation remain to be explored. Our analysis of mice with constitutive cardiomyocyte (CM)-specific knockout
(cKO) of Nedd4 revealed a unique RV-specific phenotype. Deletion of Nedd4 during early embryonic stages by
Xmlc2-Cre, which specifically expresses in early developing CMs from E7.5, resulted in dramatic RV dilation at
postnatal stages, with defects observed at E14.5. Conversely, the LV, as well as the pulmonary vessels,
appeared normal. NEDD4 is a HECT E3 ubiquitin ligase highly expressed in CMs. The severe RV-specific
abnormalities in Nedd4 cKO highlight the importance of NEDD4 in RV development. To explore molecular
mechanisms by which loss of NEDD4 in CMs resulted in RV development defects, we performed proteomics
analysis of cKO and control ventricles at E14.5. Differentially expressed proteins were enriched in pathways
involved in cellular membrane organization, vacuolar transport and vesicle-mediated transport. To determine
whether loss of Nedd4 disrupts cellular membrane organization, we performed TEM analysis on cKO and
control hearts at E14.5. Intriguingly, a massive expansion of endoplasmic reticulum and perinuclear space
accompanied by large cellular vacuoles was observed in RV tissues of cKOs, while the LV displayed normal
ultrastructure, suggesting that Nedd4 is essential for cellular membrane organization in RV CMs. To determine
the ongoing CM-specific requirement for NEDD4 in RV development at different stages, we generated
tamoxifen inducible CM-specific Nedd4 knockout mouse models to ablate Nedd4 at embryonic, perinatal or
adult stages. Our preliminary data revealed that ablation of Nedd4 in either postnatal or adult CMs did not
result in the dilated RV phenotype observed in Nedd4 cKOs, suggesting a specific requirement for Nedd4 in
embryonic CMs, although the critical time window during which Nedd4 controls RV development, and detailed
molecular mechanisms by which it does so remain unknown. The unique RV phenotype of Nedd4 cKO mice
will allow us to uncover RV-specific pathways required for heart development, and to model the impact of RV
dysfunction on cardiac performance, of relevance to CHDs associated with RV dysfunction. We will test the
hypothesis that Nedd4 plays essential roles in CM subcellular membrane organization and RV development.
Our Specific Aims are: 1) To elucidate the role of Nedd4 in RV development, as well as the impact of
congenital RV defects on cardiac performance, by histological, physiological, biochemical, and molecular
analyses of constitutive Nedd4 cKO mice; and 2) To determine the critical window during which Nedd4 is
required for RV development by analysis of Tnnt2MerCreMer:Nedd4 inducible CM-specific knockout (ticKO) mice."

The overall purpose of this proposal is to maintain and enhance the capacity of the California occupational
health surveillance program to identify state priorities and guide efforts to improve and protect worker
safety and health; monitor statistical and other trends and progress over time; and develop and distribute
prevention and intervention recommendations. This proposal is submitted as part of an Expanded Program
that includes the enhanced fundamental activities and builds upon that program with three targeted
surveillance, investigation, and prevention efforts for the “legacy” program areas of Occupational
Respiratory Disease, Occupational Pesticide Illness, and Fatality Assessment and Control Evaluation. The
California occupational health and safety surveillance program has been approved by the California Health
and Human Services Agency’s Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects (CPHS) and is submitted
as a research proposal that addresses significance, innovation, and approach. Some activities related to
investigation of emerging hazards are determined through CPHS review to be public health practice.
The Occupational Health Branch (OHB) has a long and successful history (since 1987) of working in
collaboration with NIOSH, other state occupational health programs, and partners within California to
promote worker health and safety through our public health prevention efforts. An important programmatic
objective is to ensure that its surveillance and intervention activities are integrated within the prevention
activities of both OHB and the broader public health infrastructure in California, including other CDPH
programs, other state and local public health agencies, Cal/OSHA, academic institutions, the workers’
compensation system, and organizations representing workers, employers, and health professionals. In
addition, the activities are based on the premise of research to practice – of completing the surveillance
loop by translating findings from surveillance data analyses, case ascertainment, and field investigations
into practical interventions, prevention strategies, and policy recommendations; tailoring prevention
messages to each target audience using stakeholder input during product development; gathering
evaluation feedback to ensure that the guidance is useful; and continually improving the program’s
performance and effectiveness. The successful implementation of this program is aimed at reducing the
burden of occupational illness and injury in California by providing outputs, including presentations, web-
based resources, educational materials, and journal articles, that are easily usable by stakeholders for
implementing workplace improvements and policy changes. Projected intermediate and end outcomes
include changes in work practices and reductions in worker exposures at workplaces that adopt the
recommendations for interventions and prevention strategies."

Wisconsin Occupational Health Surveillance Expanded Program
Project Summary
Wisconsin’s partnership since 1984 with National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
(NIOSH) has enabled the Occupational Health (OH) Program to develop the capabilities,
partnerships, and capacity to reduce occupational injuries and deaths in Wisconsin and
contribute occupational health data to the national surveillance system. Wisconsin’s OH
Program activities meaningfully advance NIOSH priorities, National Occupational Research
Agenda (NORA) priorities, Healthy People 2030 objectives, and Wisconsin’s health
improvement plan. The Expanded Program has three specific aims: 1) Continue and expand
Wisconsin’s occupational illness, injury and death surveillance activities; 2) Disseminate
Occupational Health information to Wisconsin stakeholders and national partners; 3) Identify,
develop and promote public health interventions to improve occupational health and safety.
Three expanded projects are proposed: Enhancement of Occupational Surveillance through
Electronic Case Reporting and Data Capture; Surveillance, Epidemiology, and Prevention of
Occupational Infectious Diseases; and Occupational Respiratory Disease Surveillance.
Continued funding will allow the Wisconsin OH program to expand population and individual
based surveillance data to yield important information about trends, injury clusters, and
emerging issues that will support effective, science-based interventions for targeted worker
populations, especially those most at risk for injury or illness. The proposed Expanded Program
will use and improve Wisconsin’s occupational health surveillance data systems to identify
trends in incidence and prevalence of occupational injuries, deaths, and exposures; establish
annual priorities; and develop and disseminate public health recommendations for occupational
health interventions to reduce the incidence of work-related injuries and illnesses in Wisconsin."

Numerous human diseases result from recurrent DNA rearrangements involving unstable genomic regions. They
are facilitated by the presence of region-specific low-copy repeats (LCRs) and are the result of nonallelic
homologous recombination (NAHR) between such paralogous genomic segments. The 22q11.2 region
undergoes a significant number of germline rearrangements. As such, it has been classified as one of the more
unstable regions of the human genome. The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is the most common
microdeletion disorder. It is associated with phenotypic and neuropsychiatric pathology, both of which are widely
variable. In most affected individuals, the deletion is de novo and is the result of NAHR mediated by four
chromosome22-specific low copy repeats (LCRA, -B, -C and -D) in 22q11. Their size and the presence of
numerous segments with near-identical sequence render these chromosome specific LCRs as substrates for
NAHR. Numerous genomic disorders, including the 22q11DS are the result of NAHR. LCR22s are extremely
difficult to reliably map and sequence because of their structural characteristics. Currently, an accurate reference
sequence for the region does not exist. Also, they are recalcitrant to short read sequencing such that the level
of their polymorphism and variability in the general population is unknown. However, optical mapping of the
region with Bionano Genomics' Saphyr technology overcomes this difficulty. Thus, 22q11.2 becomes a test case
for LCR delineation by optical mapping. Our preliminary optical mapping data suggests a complex organization
of duplicated 160kb modules within LCRA and LCRD, including copy number and orientation differences.
Further, a common inversion polymorphism within LCRD has been identified. Our preliminary data suggests that
this polymorphic inversion is less prevalent in African Americans (AAs), which may finally explain the relative
deficit of AAs in our CHOP-based 22q11DS cohort. We propose to employ innovative Bionano optical mapping
technology to determine the frequency of 22q11 LCR polymorphisms in the general population and explore the
role they play in facilitating rearrangements. The prevalence of the LCRD inversion in several different
populations (CEU, African, and African American subjects from the 1000 Genomes Project; local white and AA
22q11DS trios) will be determined. The LCR22-containing regions associated with 22q11DS will be examined in
these same populations to determine their structure and variation. Finally, we propose to analyze the breakpoints
of some typical and atypical 22q11.2 deletions and duplications guided by Bionano optical maps derived from
probands in the 22q11DS and duplication trios. By leveraging the increased sensitivity afforded by long single
molecule optical mapping on nanochannel arrays, this proposal will elucidate the previously unmapped structure
and variation of LCR22s and surrounding regions in greater detail. The data and maps generated herein will
provide access to many other difficult to map and sequence genomic regions and other genomic disorders."

In response to PAR-20-099 “Harmonization of Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias
(AD/RD) Genetic, Epidemiologic, and Clinical Data to Enhance Therapeutic Target Discovery”,
we have assembled a multidisciplinary team that includes experts in neuroimaging,
neuropsychology, fluid biomarkers, neuropathology, and vascular contributions to ADRD to work
in close partnership with the NIH and the Alzheimer’s Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP). Our
ADSP Phenotype Harmonization Consortium, or “ADSP-PHC”, seeks to work in coordination
with existing ADSP workgroups and initiatives to (1) streamline access to endophenotype data,
(2) provide high quality endophenotype harmonization across multiple research domains, and
(3) provide comprehensive documentation of both data availability and harmonization
procedures. This project includes two coordinating centers, three cores, and eight domain-
specific harmonization teams led by world-renowned experts in their fields. While our efforts will
focus on data access, documentation, and harmonization, we will work closely with other ADSP
workgroups and other large-scale harmonization efforts to maximize the impact and align with
NIH priorities. In particular, we will focus harmonization on ADRD-related endophenotypes,
including cognitive scores derived from detailed neuropsychological assessments, measures of
neuropathology measured both ex vivo (neuropathological assessment at autopsy) and in vivo
(fluid biomarkers and positron emission tomography biomarkers), concomitant pathways of
injury (vascular risk factors and vascular brain injury), and measures of neurodegeneration
focusing on both white (diffusion-weighted MRI) and grey matter (T1-weighted MRI). The
proposed harmonization effort will provide an unprecedented opportunity to disentangle the
genetic architecture of individual biological contributors to ADRD risk and progression. The
harmonized data, protocols, and educational tools developed by the ADSP-PHC will transform
the ADRD landscape, accelerate discovery, and facilitate the application of emerging big data
analytic approaches leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence."

The appropriate control of DNA topology has a major impact on the stability and flow of
genetic information. The present application focuses on type II DNA topoisomerases,
molecular machines that modulate DNA supercoiling and remove chromosome
entanglements by catalyzing the ATP-dependent transport of one DNA duplex through
another. Type II topoisomerases play a frontline role in cancer biology as factors that can
both maintain and disrupt genome integrity; they are also demonstrated drug targets for
treating cancer.
Our past research on eukaryotic topoisomerase II (topo II) has opened up new research
avenues for understanding cancer etiology and improving cancer treatment. The present
application will deliver groundbreaking solutions to key problems in the field, including how
certain classes of anti-topo II drugs act on the enzyme, how topo II is localized to key sites
of action where it resolves potentially deleterious chromosomal topologies, and how
aberrant topo II activity can promote DNA damage and genetic instability. We will also
investigate innovative concepts and highly significant lines of inquiry raised by our new
findings, such as how metabolites produced by the TCA cycle control topo II function.
Our approach is distinguished by a comprehensive blend of biochemical, structural,
computational, cell-based, and chemical biology methodologies. High-impact outcomes
will include defining how topo II appropriately localizes with chromatin and partner proteins
to mitigate its natural DNA-damaging potential, establishing how the specificity of anti-topo
II agents can be improved to enhance their utility in cancer treatment, and revealing the
potential for natural amino-acid sequence variation in type II topoisomerases to destabilize
human chromosomes and act as cancer drivers. Past progress and unpublished findings
establish the feasibility of our planned goals."
10864814,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Axons form connections between neurons over great distances in the brain and body, hence are vulnerable to
damage and stress. This project studies an evolutionarily conserved stress response pathway that becomes
activated in multiple scenarios of axonal damage and stress. The pathway, governed by the dileucine zipper
kinase DLK, known as Wallenda (Wnd) in Drosophila, engages structural plasticity mechanisms in neurons
that allow circuits to adapt to axon damage. These responses include axonal regeneration, neuronal death,
and, newly discovered in this project, synapse loss. The long-term goals of this project are (1) to understand
the mechanisms that lead to DLK signaling activation, and (2) to understand the cellular pathways that are
regulated by DLK. The project combines studies in both Drosophila and mice, focusing on motoneuron (MN)
responses to peripheral nerve injury (PNI). For the first goal, Aim 1 tests a hypothesis that DLK/Wnd signaling
is restrained by the presence of an intact synaptic connection, hence becomes activated following synapse
loss. The experiments build upon observations in complementary paradigms of synapse loss at Drosophila
neuromuscular junction (NMJ) synapse: (a) injuries to branched axons demonstrate that only complete
removal of all efferent connections are capable of activating Wnd signaling; (b) multiple cytoskeletal mutations
that lead to retraction and degeneration of NMJ synapses also lead to Wnd signaling activation. The proposed
experiments will distinguish how synaptic interactions intersect with the process of axonal transport to control
the activation of Wnd. Aim 2 studies the downstream responses regulated by DLK that enable structural
plasticity, and focuses on new phenotypes for DLK in the mouse spinal cord: the loss of synaptic inputs on the
cell bodies of axotomized MNs (termed `synaptic stripping') is dependent upon DLK function in MNs. In
addition, the recruitment of activated microglia to the MN cell body, which precedes the synapse loss, requires
DLK function in axotomized MNs. Aim 2 will test a hypothesis that DLK signaling gates the secretion of
molecular signals that recruit specific responses in microglia to facilitate synapse loss. The experiments will
evaluate the requirement of candidate secreted and immune molecules that were identified from a RiboTag
translational profiling approach to be strong targets of DLK regulation in axotomized MNs. The experiments will
also identify the microglial responses gated by DLK in axotomized MNs through single cell RNA-seq of isolated
microglia. Taken together, this work is expected to shed new light on neuron-microglial interactions relevant to
nervous system injury, and mechanisms structural plasticity and synapse loss through the specific lens of a
specific axonal damage signaling pathway."

Aging is associated with significant declines in muscle mass, strength, and physical performance, which often
lead to disability, loss of independence, and adverse clinical outcomes including multimorbidity and mortality.
At present, health care providers have no therapeutic options to offer their patients to slow aging-related
declines in physical function. Importantly, evidence is emerging that statins could be an effective treatment for
preserving physical function by preventing disabling events such as stroke, heart failure, or myocardial
infarction. In addition, statins have pleiotropic properties including anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and immuno-
modulatory effects, which may slow or prevent aging-related declines in physical function. However, reports of
muscle pain and weakness in patients on statins has led to a significant number of patients discontinuing
statins. Thus, the proposed study is critical to establish whether statins may help to preserve physical function
and independence in older adults, or whether statin-associated muscle symptoms portend a statin-related
decline in physical function. The PREVENTABLE trial (U19 AG065188) provides an ideal opportunity to
definitively determine the effect of statins as a treatment for aging-related declines in physical function.
PREVENTABLE is a placebo-controlled pragmatic clinical trial designed to investigate whether randomization
to a statin can prevent dementia and prolong disability-free survival in 20,000 participants aged 75+ years
without clinically evident coronary heart disease. While the PREVENTABLE trial will help clarify the effects of
statins on self-reported disability, the proposed ancillary study will extend and validate the physical disability
data by investigating the effects of statins on changes in physical performance, which are typically observed
earlier in the trajectory of functional decline and may be a more sensitive marker for the effects of statin. To
determine if statins affect longitudinal change in physical performance, the proposed ancillary will add the
Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), a validated measure of lower-extremity performance comprised of
balance tasks, a 4-m walk, and repeated chair stand test, over 3 years of follow-up in 2,500 PREVENTABLE
participants (1,250 per intervention arm). Self-reported information on patient-centered outcomes relevant to
physical function including statin-associated muscle symptoms, fatigue, and pain will also be collected. The
specific aims of this ancillary study are to: 1) determine whether randomization to statin slows the aging-
related decline in usual gait speed; 2) determine whether randomization to statin slows aging-related declines
in lower-extremity function (SPPB score) and strength (chair rise time); and 3) explore whether randomization
to statin is associated with self-reported statin-associated muscle symptoms, fatigue, and pain. By leveraging
the rich resources and infrastructure of PREVENTABLE, this timely and cost-effective study provides a unique
opportunity to significantly expand the scope and impact of the parent trial on self-reported physical disability
by determining the therapeutic potential of statins to slow aging-related declines in physical performance."
10842413,"Racial disparities in colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence persist for blacks and whites. Given the previous
work of our team documenting racial differences in the gut microbiota of blacks and whites and the evidence
supporting the interaction between diet and the gut microbiota as a risk factor for colorectal cancer, the study of
how various diets affect the structure and function of the gut microbiota across racial groups is warranted.
Previous research has shown that the gut microbiota can be rapidly altered by changes in diet. For example,
consumption of an extremely high fiber (>50 grams) diet has produced changes in the gut microbiota that are
believed to reduce cancer risk. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, rich in fruits,
vegetables, whole grains and low-fat dairy, is commonly recommended for heart health and has been shown to
lower blood pressure and produce weight loss. However, to our knowledge, the effect of the DASH diet on the
gut microbiota has not been studied. Because the DASH diet provides substantial fiber, we hypothesize that
consumption of the DASH diet will lead to improvements in the gut microbiota of non-Hispanic black and white
adults. In this proposal, we plan to investigate our hypothesis by recruiting a generally healthy sample of 112
black and white adults from Birmingham, AL to participate in a 28-day randomized, controlled feeding study.
Participants will be randomized to receive either the DASH diet or a standard American diet. All meals will be
provided by the study. Fecal samples will be collected at multiple time points before, during, and after the dietary
intervention and will be analyzed using PCR to amplify the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene and to sequence
bases using the MiSeq platform. Sequenced data will then be analyzed using QIIME. We hypothesize that
participants receiving the DASH diet will have a greater increase in alpha diversity and greater changes in
abundances of CRC-associated microbes than participants receiving the standard American diet. We will also
evaluate functional-level markers including bile acid and short chain fatty acid (SCFA) production and
inflammatory markers. If our hypothesis is supported, we expect to see reduced production of secondary bile
acids (e.g., deoxycholic acid), greater SCFA production (e.g, butyrate), and reduction in gut and systemic
inflammation (e.g, calprotectin, IL-6) among participants receiving the DASH diet compared to the standard
American diet. Our findings will provide preliminary evidence for the DASH diet as an approach for cultivating
a healthier gut microbiota across racially diverse populations. These findings can impact clinical, translational,
and population-level approaches for modification of the gut microbiota to reduce risk of chronic diseases like
CRC."
10839400,"SUMMARY
Mitochondrial dysfunction is a pathologic hallmark in the onset and pathogenesis of nearly all
neurodegenerative diseases. One of the primary determinants in dictating mitochondrial function is the activity
of inner membrane (IM) proteases including the ATP-dependent AAA+ zinc metalloproteases YME1L and
AFG3L2 and the ATP-independent zinc metalloprotease OMA1. These proteases regulate many different
aspects of mitochondrial biology and function to protect mitochondria from pathologic insults. However,
imbalances in the activity of IM proteases induced by genetic or environmental factors are implicated in the
pathogenesis of etiologically-diverse diseases including many neurodegenerative disorders. Despite this, the
molecular mechanisms by which IM proteases regulate mitochondrial biology remain poorly understood. Here,
we are applying a structure-driven approach to determine the molecular mechanisms by which IM proteases
regulate mitochondria in the context of health and disease. We previously solved the first high-resolution
structures of the IM AAA+ proteases YME1 and AFG3L2. Our structures showed that these two proteases
employ a conserved nucleotide-driven, hand-over-hand mechanism to translocate substrates into a privileged
proteolytic chamber for proteolysis. Surprisingly, we also identified unique structural features of YME1 and
AFG3L2 that integrate into this conserved translocation mechanism to distinctly influence protease activity and
stability. Here, we hypothesize that these unique structural differences endow IM proteases with
different mechanistic and biologic functions important for their regulation of mitochondria. To address
this, we are using a combination of cryo-electron microscopy and cell biology to determine how structural
differences in IM AAA+ proteases influence their mechanochemical cycle and enable proteases to perform
distinct biological functions. This will reveal new insights into the molecular mechanisms by which IM AAA+
proteases regulate mitochondria in health and disease. Furthermore, we are extending this study utilizing both
functional genomic and structural approaches to establish a structure-function relationship that explains the
activation and proteolytic activity of the ATP-independent, stress-activated IM protease OMA1 – a protease
whose dysregulation is implicated in the pathologic mitochondrial dysfunction associated with many human
diseases. Through these efforts, we will define how IM proteases utilize distinct structural features to perform
the myriad of biological functions required for the proper regulation of mitochondrial proteostasis and function.
Furthermore, we will reveal new insights into the pathologic and potentially therapeutic implications of altered
mitochondrial IM protease activity in human disease and identify new opportunities to pharmacologically target
IM proteases to mitigate mitochondrial dysfunction associated with many neurodegenerative disorders."

cognitive, and motor domains in via cortico-basal ganglia circuits and the early postnatal
development of these connections. We have previously demonstrated the convergence of

myelin development varies not only in frontal grey matter areas, but also between layer within
areas. We will build on these results to evaluate postnatal development of frontal inputs to the
ventral striatum. Aim 1 combines conventional tracing experiments with computational tools to
develop a complete map of fronto-striatal connections, identifying areas in which fiber from
diverse functional regions of cortex converge in the striatum. Aim 2 will examine postnatal myelin
expansion during early postnatal development compared to adult animals. Aim 3 will bring
together results from Aims 1 & 2 to determine potential changes in FC-striatal connectivity and its

The persistence of clinical effects long after acute intoxication has worn off implies lasting brain changes, but the

correlates of clinical change after a single dose of psilocybin in OCD, in the context of an independently funded

with the experimental therapeutics framework, we here examine the hypothesized brain effects of psilocybin;
while we predict that these will be associated with symptom improvement, our analyses will be informative
whether or not psilocybin proves to have a beneficial clinical effect in this controlled trial. We focus on the default
mode network (DMN), a network known to be involved in the evaluation of internal states, disrupted in OCD, and
affected by psilocybin in other populations. We hypothesize that psilocybin will result in increased (i.e.
normalized) intra-DMN functional connectivity in OCD, and that this will correlate with any clinical change (Aim
1). Baseline DMN connectivity is anticipated to predict subsequent neural and clinical change (Aim 2). Finally,
we will examine connectivity within the corticostriatal circuitry (Aim 3); while this circuitry has not previously been
investigated in the context of psilocybin, it is robustly implicated in OCD.
This work will shed light on the neurobiological underpinnings of lasting clinical and behavioral effects effects
of psilocybin in neuropsychiatric disease, with potential implications for other rapid-acting pharmacological

The objective of this project is to evaluate the contribution of racial/ethnic and socioeconomic inequalities in

novel nationwide public drinking water contaminant exposure estimates will be derived primarily using data
from the US Environmental Protection Agency's Six Year Review of Contaminant Occurrence database, which

For patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) there are few effective
treatments for memory enhancement. Strategies that directly manipulate neural activity are promising but
currently have serious limitations. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the entorhinal cortex (ERc), a part of the brain
important for memory, in a small sample of patients has been shown to improve memory, but DBS is highly
invasive and requires neurosurgery. Other neuromodulation techniques that do not require surgery are limited
in that they target only surface brain structures. In MCI and AD, it is the deep brain structures, including the ERc
and the hippocampus (HC) that are most affected. Low intensity focused ultrasound pulsation (LIFUP) uses
acoustic energy waves with frequencies higher than humans can hear to penetrate the skull to effect specifically
targeted deep brain regions. Therefore, LIFUP could be targeted at the deep brain structures critical for episodic
memory formation, the same regions that are affected in MCI and AD. We are the first to do just this and our
preliminary data shows that LIFUP: increases perfusion of the ERc; increased functional connectivity of the
ERc/HC memory network and may improve behavioral memory performance. Our LIFUP set-up is safe to use
inside a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine which allows for simultaneous brain modulation and real-
time measurement of the modulation using MRI. We will use each participant’s structural brain MRI to aim LIFUP
at the ERc. This will allow us to directly test the effects of LIFUP on activity in the ERc, in other brain regions
connected to the ERc (e.g. HC), as well as on blood flow in the HC and other brain areas important for memory.
Applying this to patients with MCI, we will try to determine the dose, booster effect and duration of LIFUP effects
on brain and blood flow, structure and function, determine whether these LIFUP-related changes improve
memory in this population and evaluate the effect of LIFUP on blood-based biomarkers of AD-related
neurodegeneration. Understanding how the parameters of LIFUP dose and booster session effect the impact
and duration of LIFUP on brain, biomarker and memory performance will be a significant step towards
constructing a comprehensive clinical trial. The ability to change the activity and blood flow of brain regions by
targeting them with LIFUP would be an important step towards developing a non-invasive memory prosthetic
that would make a very significant contribution to AD treatment."

impairment associated with vulnerability to stressors, and it is characterized by the presence of unintentional
weight loss, self-reported exhaustion or fatigue, measured muscle weakness, slow walking speed, and low
physical activity. Sarcopenia, defined as a reduction of muscle mass and/or muscle strength, is one of the
components of the frailty phenotype. In the general population, physical exercise prevents the loss of muscle
mass and improves frailty status. In patients with ESRD, however, exercise is not as effective as in the general
population. Mitochondria are essential for proper muscle function, and recent studies suggest that
mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to the reduction in muscle mass. We and others have found that
mitochondrial abnormalities and decreased mitochondrial content are present in patients with ESRD. The
number of mitochondria depends on the balance between biogenesis (generation of new mitochondria) and
mitophagy (degradation of mitochondria). Physical exercise improves mitochondrial function and increases the
mitochondrial number in skeletal muscle in the general population. But the benefits of exercise on
mitochondrial function in patients with ESRD have not been studied.
 In this study, we will evaluate the overarching hypothesis that mitochondrial dysfunction hinders the
beneficial effects of exercise in patients with ESRD. Thus, in Specific Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis
that Coenzyme Q10, a mitochondrial-targeted therapy, improves muscle adaptation to exercise training in
patients with ESRD. For this aim, patients with ESRD will be enrolled in a 12-week exercise program or in an
observational group. Patients will also receive either Coenzyme Q10 supplementation or placebo. As a result,
patients will be assigned to four different groups, exercise plus placebo, exercise plus Coenzyme Q10,
observational plus placebo, observational plus Coenzyme Q10. This study design will allow us to evaluate the
individual effect of the interventions and the additive effect of the interventions. We anticipate that the
combination of exercise and Coenzyme Q10 will have an additive effect in improving and mitochondrial function
and physical performance in patients with ESRD. In Specific Aim 2 we will test the hypothesis that the
combination of exercise training and Coenzyme Q10 improves mitochondrial function in patients with ESRD by
increasing mitochondrial respiration and content, and improving mitochondrial dynamics (i.e., remodeling
through fission and fusion). Therefore, we will measure mitochondrial respiration and markers of mitochondrial
biogenesis and dynamics in muscle biopsies within a sub-group of patients from Specific Aim 1. Results from
these studies could affect millions of people with ESRD by improving physical function and their quality of life."

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States, with the
prevalence of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) rising every year. Currently, there is no single
non-invasive diagnostic test for accurate diagnosis of HFpEF. HFpEF is diagnosed through a combination of
symptom assessments, plasma biomarkers, and cardiac imaging. When patients are acutely decompensated,
HFpEF can be diagnosed with high confidence. However, among stable outpatients presenting with dyspnea on
exertion and an intermediate pre-test probability of HFpEF, diagnosis is extremely challenging. Since non-
invasive testing has limited diagnostic specificity, in these cases, invasive hemodynamic cardiopulmonary
exercise testing (iCPET) is considered the gold standard. However, iCPET is invasive, carries risk, and is
performed only in specialized centers. Cardiovascular MRI (CMR) can non-invasively assess HF-related heart
and vascular abnormalities including biventricular structure/function, myocardial tissue composition, coronary
microvascular function, aortic distensibility/stiffness, and fat accumulation. As cardiovascular and pulmonary
symptoms of HFpEF occur with exertion, the objective of this proposal is to use a supine ergometer mounted on
the MRI scanner table to examine heart and lung pathophysiology with exercise of incrementally increasing
resistance, followed by a conventional vasodilator stress imaging protocol. The goal of this study is to use our
novel cardiopulmonary exercise MRI protocol to accurately diagnose “early” HFpEF, to eliminate the need for
iCPET, and to identify specific pathophysiologies underlying HFpEF progression and prognostic information for
adverse CVD outcomes. To achieve this, we will recruit patients from three medical centers to conduct a
prospective study using cardiopulmonary exercise MRI in suspected “early” HFpEF patients who are clinically
referred for iCPET, with a follow-up MRI scan 18 months later. Our three specific aims seek to 1) Investigate
non-invasive imaging correlates and diagnostic performance of cardiopulmonary MRI for early HFpEF diagnosis
in patients with normal ejection fraction and unexplained dyspnea, using iCPET as a reference standard; 2)
Investigate the relationship between cardiopulmonary exercise MRI parameters and CVD health outcomes,
including cardiovascular death and hospitalization in suspected early HFpEF; 3) Explore temporal changes in
heart and lung structure and function in suspected early HFpEF by completing a second cardiopulmonary
exercise MRI 18 months after the initial MRI exam. This innovative cardiopulmonary exercise MRI protocol is
expected to improve non-invasive diagnosis and prognosis of HFpEF, and ultimately contribute to improved
treatment strategies and preventative care by providing more accurate diagnostic criteria and a non-invasive
method of monitoring the efficacy of new treatment strategies in clinical trials."
10923873,"Project Summary/Abstract
Metabolism plays a fundamental role in cancer growth, diagnosis (e.g. FDG-PET), and treatment (e.g.
antifolates, asparaginase). Over the past decade, research into cancer metabolism has flourished,
contextualized by the realization that metabolic changes in cancer are triggered by oncogene signaling and
accelerated by the emergence of new measurement tools. This NCI Research Specialist Award will study
cancer metabolism using the most important modern tools: mass spectrometry and isotope tracers. Working
together with Unit Director Joshua Rabinowitz and his lab, and a diverse set of collaborators from Rutgers
Cancer Institute of New Jersey and other leading institutions, I aim over the next 5 years to achieve the
following: (1) Optimize LC-MS-based metabolomic methods, focusing on ultrasensitive measurements
appropriate for small biopsy samples and on novel metabolite identification via untargeted metabolomics. (2)
Develop and optimize the imaging mass spectrometry methods for spatial metabolomics. (3) Combine these
methods with isotope tracers to determine fluxes in tumors in vivo. Rabinowitz and I have a long-standing
leadership position in isotope tracer methods for quantitating metabolic fluxes. We have recently developed
protocols for infusing a wide variety of 13C, 15N, and 2H-tracers into mice, with the goal of enabling quantitation
of tumor metabolic flux. We are pushing to enable these measurements also by mass spectrometry imaging,
eventually with single cell resolution. Resulting data will provide critical insights into the metabolic
pathophysiology of cancer and immune cells in the native tumor microenvironment and will thereby inform
treatment selection strategies and the development of novel therapeutics."
10917141,"ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
Cervical cancer, entirely preventable, remains the 4th most common cause of cancer incidence and mortality in
women, with over 12 million new cases predicted in the next 50 years without sustained scale-up of HPV
vaccination and cervical screening. More than 80% of the disease burden occurs in low- and middle-income
countries (LMICs), reflecting inequitable availability and adoption of effective preventive strategies.
Unfortunately, sustainable implementation of cervical screening and management for cervical cancer
prevention has been elusive in LMICs, reflecting challenges of implementing complex health interventions in
complex adaptive health systems. In the parent study, using participatory systems thinking as our `grand
theory', we integrated various implementation science frameworks into the Integrative Systems Praxis for
Implementation Research (INSPIRE) to guide multilevel stakeholders through four phases of an iterative cycle
of implementation activities, enabling stakeholder-engaged adaptation of complex health technologies to local
health system contexts. In Aim 1 of the continuation of this project, we will conduct a realist evaluation of
stakeholders involved in the INSPIRE research, to gain an understanding of the mechanisms through which
the INSPIRE activities led to successful adoption and rapid scale-up of HPV-based testing in a large health
network in the Peruvian Amazon. In Aim 2 we propose to translate the INSPIRE research methodology into a
generalizable implementation strategy (Aim 2) – “Adaptation, Scale-Up, Sustainability: Implementation by
Systems Thinking” (ASSIST) - and develop an implementation toolkit to enable stakeholder-engaged
implementation planning and context adaptation. In Aim 3, we will leverage the planned scale-up of HPV
implementation plans from the Peruvian Ministry of Health to test the ASSIST implementation strategy for
impact on screening coverage and management using an interrupted time series design, using the extended
RE-AIM evaluation framework. In parallel, we will conduct a qualitative comparative case study to enable
understanding of context-dependent mediators and modifiers to the success of the ASSIST implementation
strategy (Aim 3). The realist evaluations are designed to examine `what works for whom, in what
circumstances, in what respects, and how' vs assuming that one size fits all. Ultimately, meeting our proposal
aims will advance public health, by providing a broadly generalizable process and toolkit for context-adaption
of HPV-based screening and management that can be used in LMICs, and implementation science, by helping
to reduce the evidence gap in implementation science for approaching scale-up and sustainability of complex
health interventions in diverse contexts."
10880665,"Abstract: The corpus callosum – the largest fiber tract in the human brain, connects and integrates the two
cerebral hemispheres. Agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC) with an incidence of 1 in 2,000 occurs in rare
syndromes and in common neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) including epilepsy, intellectual disability (ID),
autism spectrum disorder (ASD), cerebral palsy and schizophrenia. Collectively these affect more than 5% of
the population and constitute a major public health concern. Recent evidence including from our team, points
to the importance of genetic etiologies. Our whole exome efforts in this grant’s initial submission identified 70
ACC genes that reached genome-wide significance, of which many of which are strong novel candidate genes
that need further validation. Based on population estimates, we expect that several hundred additional genes
will cause ACC. To discover the full range of ACC genetics and to make progress using model systems, we
bring together an outstanding investigative team that has made significant contributions to the biology of ACC.
Together we will advance gene discovery, and tackle key questions on CC development. To do so we will:
Aim 1: Identify novel de novo genetic causes of ACC and NDD. To do so, we will recruit, obtain clinical
data and conduct WES for 1000+ ACC trios from UCSF and collaborators. We will also receive genetic
information from 2000+ trios from the two largest commercial exome sequencing laboratories in the US,
GeneDx and Invitae. We will also leverage the community’s gene discovery efforts using MatchMaker, and
work with the IRC5 (international research consortium for the corpus callosum and cerebral connectivity:
www.IRC5.org), which the PI’s co-founded. These combined efforts will ensure robust novel gene discovery.
Aim #2: Discover genetic causes of ACC beyond germline de novo coding variants. In addition to gene
discovery above, we hypothesize that many ACC cases are caused by mutations in complex genomic regions.
We will initially focus on Aicardi syndrome, a highly complex yet distinctive brain malformation disorder. We will
conduct short-read deep WGS from affected brain tissue (6 in hand) and other tissues, collaborating with the
Broad Mendelian Genome Center, to perform long-read sequencing to resolve complex genomic architecture
and other difficult to sequence regions. We will also utilize the same work flow to tackle gene discovery in
similarly phenotypically unified conditions in particular focusing on multiplex cases.
Aim #3: Engage in functional confirmation and analysis of ACC candidate genes. During our current
cycle, we have made significant progress studying the biology C12ORF57. In this proposal, we will advance
this directly, by 1. Studying the protein interaction network for C12ORF57 and CAMKIV. We will also study the
signaling pathways that link CAMKIV to the transcription factor CREB and to regulation of AMPA receptors, the
key glutamatergic receptors for excitatory neural transmission. This work may have critical implications for
treatment strategies in epilepsy and possibly disorders of cognition."
10906668,"More than 60% cancer patients experience chemotherapy-induced neuropathy (CIN), a severe side effect of
chemotherapy (including platinum drugs, vinca alkaloids, taxanes and/or bortezomib). CIN may cause
treatment delays, dose reductions, or discontinuation of therapy which can affect survival rates. With
improved cancer treatments and longer survival, the late effects of CIN continue to produce a significant
burden in up to 50% of cancer survivors who are suffering from CIN 6 years after treatment, with a 1.8-fold
increased risk of falls. CIN continues to cause significant functional disability, negatively impacts quality of
life, and significantly demands high health care costs and resource use.
We propose to test auricular point acupressure (APA)—a non-invasive and nonpharmacological patient
managed strategy—as an innovative solution for CIN. APA is developed from auricular acupuncture, which
is an invasive (using needles) and passive treatment (administered by a licensed practitioner). APA is a
non-invasive and active treatment for patients with pain. It involves needleless acupuncture-like stimulation
of ear points. Small seeds are taped on specific ear points by a skilled provider and patients press on the
seeds to stimulate ear points three times daily, three minutes per time, for a total of nine minutes per day to
achieve pain relief. APA provides pain relief within 1–2 minutes after ear stimulation and sustains pain relief
for one month after a 4-week APA intervention. APA is popular in Taiwan, China, and Europe. Though its
use is sparse in the U.S., a limited number of clinical trials have supported APA in pain management.
This study will provide vital information to gain a comprehensive understanding of underlying mechanism of
APA on CIN and provide strong impetus for including APA as part of CIN management in clinical settings."
10820138,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Falls are a severe societal issue with vast physical and economic consequences. As we age, there are a variety of
factors that are associated with an increased falls risk such as declines in sensor, motor, and cognitive-motor
acuity. These changes may affect how we compensate for being in a fatigued state to better navigate dynamic
walking challenges due to the additional risks that they put older adults at for falls. The overarching scientific
premise of this fellowship proposal is that local muscle fatigability compromises the neuromuscular control of
walking balance and importunately precipitates gait instability in a direction-dependent and context-specific
ways in older adults. This project will recruit 30 young adults, 30 older adult non-fallers, and 30 older adult
fallers to participate in two sessions: one designed to objectively target the local fatigability of muscles that
regulate sagittal plane motion and stability and another designed to objectively target the local fatigability of
muscles that regulate coronal plane motion and stability. This project strategically combines sophisticated
motion capture and electromyographic time-frequency analyses with an innovative suite of walking balance
perturbations designed to emulate real-world balance challenges to identify novel mechanistic causes for
increased falls risk. This research study will be the first to establish the mechanisms behind fatigues effect on
walking stability through the usage of directional local muscle fatigability and a comprehensive and task specific
collection of walking balance perturbations integrated with musculoskeletal modeling and simulations. This area
of mechanistic and hypothesis-driven research has been severely understudied, but has significant and
immediate potential to inform novel advances in diagnostics, rehabilitation, mobile monitoring, and wearable
assistive technologies to mitigate falls."
10912701,"Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is an inherited disorder caused by germ line mutations of the NF2 tumor
suppressor gene and is characterized by development of schwannomas of the VIIIth cranial nerve. Merlin, the
product of the NF2 gene, is also inactivated to a significant extent in sporadic schwannomas, meningioma,
ependymoma and mesothelioma. In spite of progress made in the understanding of the disease over the past
several years, this has not yet translated into therapies. Thus, there is an urgent and unmet need to develop
therapeutic options for NF2 patients. At a molecular level, Merlin has been shown to function as a key regulator
of multiple signal transduction pathways including those regulated by small G-proteins and the Hippo/YAP
pathway.
In an effort to identify therapeutic vulnerabilities in NF2-deficient tumors, we assessed the activity of the BET
(Bromodomain and Extra-Terminal domain) protein inhibitors NF2-null Schwann cells. The BET proteins are
characterized by the presence of two tandem bromodomains and an extra-terminal domain. The bromodomains
can specifically bind acetylated lysine residues on histones, serving as epigenetic readers that decipher the
histone acetylation code. Our preliminary data indicate that BET inhibition suppresses the proliferation of NF2-
null Schwann and schwannoma cells in culture and tumor growth in vivo, and that this is mediated through
inhibition of bromodomain protein 4 (BRD4). Preliminary data indicates that the effects of BRD4 are mediated to
a significant extent via regulation of YAP. Importantly, we recently demonstrated that YAP is required for the
accelerated proliferation of NF2-deficient Schwann cells and tumorigenesis. The goals of this proposal are to
identify the essential functions of BET proteins in Schwann cells and determine whether BET inhibition is a
therapeutic approach that should be further developed as a treatment modality for NF2."
10911213,"Project Summary/Abstract
Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating psychiatric disorder that affects 6% of U.S. adults, yet is
left untreated in 70% of affected individuals and up to 85% of low-income individuals. One third of the nation’s
low-income individuals are treated in Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), which do not have the
capacity to provide all their patients with first-line, evidence-based treatments for PTSD such as Prolonged
Exposure (PE). To address this problem, the study team has developed a low-intensity intervention (PTSD
Coach) and a medium-intensity intervention (PE for Primary Care: PE-PC) that effectively treat PTSD in low-
resource settings. However, some patients will still require high-intensity treatments (e.g., Full PE) for
sustained clinical benefit. Thus, there is a critical need to develop adaptive, stepped-care models to treat PTSD
in FQHCs by combining efficacious treatments, based on response to initial lower-cost strategies. The long-
term goal of this line of research is to improve access to efficacious PTSD treatments by implementing
empirically-based stepped-care behavioral interventions in low-resource domestic settings. The overall
objective in this proposal is to develop a stepped-care intervention for PTSD using a Sequential, Multiple
Assignment, Randomized Trial (SMART). The central hypothesis is that beginning with a low- or medium-
intensity PTSD intervention and then titrating intensity based on early indications of response will result in
clinically-significant PTSD symptom reduction with parsimony of resources. The rationale is that stepped-care
interventions for PTSD are scalable and less costly than static treatments, thereby improving efficiency. To
accomplish the objective, this project will employ a SMART design with 430 adults with PTSD in six FQHCs.
Participants will be initially randomized to PTSD Coach or PE-PC. After four weeks, early responders will step
down to lower frequency interaction within their current treatment strategy. Slow responders will be re-
randomized to either continue their current treatment strategy or step up to Full PE for eight weeks. The
specific aims are to: (1) Test the effectiveness of initiating treatment with PE-PC versus PTSD Coach in
reducing PTSD symptoms at 3 months (endpoint), 6-month follow-up and 9-month follow-up, and (2) Test the
effectiveness of second-stage tactics (continue or step up to Full PE) for slow responders. Exploratory aims
are to (A) Identify the optimal stepped-care treatment sequence; (B) Conduct cost-effectiveness analysis; (C)
Identify key mediators/moderators of treatment response; and (D) Prepare for future implementation through
process evaluation. This project will contribute to the field an empirically-based stepped-care intervention for
PTSD. This contribution is significant because it will improve clinical practice for PTSD by establishing an
effective treatment sequence that can be delivered in a scalable, sustainable manner. This proposal is
innovative because it will use novel methodologies to help shift the current clinical paradigm of PTSD treatment
from fixed, static, and hard-to-access treatment strategies to a dynamic, adaptive, and accessible approach."
10932132,"Abstract:
Development of shock in sepsis defines a dramatic deterioration of clinical status and is linked to a significant
increase in morbidity and mortality rates. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms determining the
vascular pathology of septic shock remain undefined.
Our past work established mast cells (MC) as key effector cells of vascular pathology in different
disease contexts. Because MC products are found in the plasma in shock but not during sepsis, this supports
that MC activation is a central event leading to septic shock. Employing state-of-the- art technologies such as
dynamic photoacoustic imaging of the microvasculature, we provide first evidence that MCs shape key features
of shock in sepsis: systemic hypotension, vascular leakage and microvascular perfusion abnormalities. In
addition, we elucidate that in sepsis MCs, which are located on the abluminal side of a relatively
impermeable endothelium, are stimulated by platelets, which can aggregate in their close proximity following
inflammatory triggers.
Based on these observations, we hypothesize that specific signaling interactions between platelets,
perivascular MCs and the endothelium drive the vascular pathology of septic shock. The objective of our work is
first to comprehensively define the mechanisms of MC-mediated vascular pathology in sepsis, second to
elucidate the specific mechanism by which platelets trigger MC responses and resultant vascular pathology
and lastly, to establish the clinical relevance of our findings in a cohort of septic patients.
Together, this project constitutes a key step towards our long-term goal to establish MC responses as
a biomarker of sepsis biology and to develop novel therapeutic strategies that may directly target the
mechanisms of disease progression in sepsis."
10911382,"PROJECT SUMMARY
There is a global upsurge of falls in older adults that impacts nearly every family across the world. Millions of
older adults fall each year in the United States, leading to catastrophic injuries, deaths and soaring healthcare
costs. Over the last decade, 911 fall calls have tripled while transport rates to the hospital after a fall have
significantly decreased. Instead, 911 is increasingly used for lift assists (falls that do not result in transport).
Deployment of emergency medical services for lift assists diverts care from higher acuity emergencies and costs
more than 200 million dollars annually in the United States. There is a potentially powerful yet underutilized
solution if we leverage the hidden opportunities of fall events, such as lift assists that do not result in catastrophic
consequences, to activate prevention strategies. This study aims to develop a scalable strategy for early
identification of individuals at high risk of falls and activate prevention solutions. We hypothesize that a systematic
911 fall call intake which has a broader concept of frailty, Frailty And Cognition+Environment (FaCE), will better
account for the compounding and cascading nature of fall risks in older adults. At the completion of this project
a scalable machine learning model which incorporates FaCE factors to predict high utilization of 911 for falls will
be developed. In addition, we will characterize barriers and facilitators for adoption, implementation, and
maintenance of fall prevention strategies in the home for patients with FaCE risk factors. This project will utilize
a blend of systems science and community-based participatory research approaches and state of the art
predictive analytics to elucidate the FaCE of falls, develop a scalable fall prevention solution that can be
implemented nationwide and inform a larger-scale implementation trial for using 911 fall calls to activate effective
fall prevention strategies in homes."

This Pathology Core (2) will provide a seamless translational infrastructure to support the research on RS tissues
planned in this application. This will include the ex vivo expansion of primary RS samples in
immunocompromised mice in an effort to generate in vivo RS primagraft models for provision of fresh or frozen
RS cells for in vitro molecular and in vivo functional experiments. The RS samples will have full clinical annotation
as well as molecular characterization (from Project 1/Core 3), and will be derived from patient samples already
stored through the DFCI RS Biospecimen Core (1) as well as newly enrolled patients from DFCI and collaborating
institutions. These models are a significant and increasingly appreciated tool for the analysis of newly identified
genetic lesions, associated signaling and survival pathways, rational therapeutic targets and mechanisms of
drug resistance. RS cells will be delivered by tail vein injection or directly implanted subcutaneously or beneath
the renal capsule. These primagraft models could then be used to characterize biology and assess response to
therapy of the RS cells. This Pathology Core will also: (i) provide FFPE archived samples from RS patients, (ii)
provide histo-pathological analysis of human RS samples to be used in subsequent studies, (iii) generate tissue
microarrays (and slides of CLL/RS pairs for functional validation, (iv) provide morphologic and histopathologic
analysis of mouse RS samples in engineered mice, and (v) generate tissue arrays and slides to study

10912489,"Project Summary: Recent therapeutic advances have dramatically improved patient outcomes in chronic
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). However, Richter's Syndrome (RS), which is the transformation of CLL to an
aggressive lymphoma (that occurs in 0.5-1% of CLL patients annually), is often refractory to existing therapeutic
approaches. Building on the success of our current P01 in creating the world's largest map of genetic drivers
and subtypes of CLL (n=~1100) and using it to build prognostic models, this renewal application seeks to apply
similar (and new) approaches to comprehensively map the genetic underpinnings of RS. Currently, and in
contrast to CLL, little is known about the genetics, clonal composition, drivers and cell circuitry of RS, and hence
there is neither a framework for molecularly based risk stratification nor targets for therapeutic development.
Therefore, understanding the molecular (genetic, epigenetic and proteomic) underpinnings of the transformation
from CLL to RS will create opportunities for more effective therapeutic interventions, prediction of response, and
potentially early detection, all with the goal of improving patient outcome. To achieve these goals, we propose
to: (1) Define the drivers of RS and delineate the relationship of RS to CLL and DLBCL. Using whole-exome and
RNA sequencing, we will study the genetic and transcriptomic landscape of >300 RS cases, including analyzing
their pre-transformation CLL and RS samples. We will then further delineate the genetic relationship between
CLL and RS using whole-genome sequencing of a subset of cases, and chart their epigenetic landscape using
chromatin and histone methylation profiling. Moreover, we will trace the evolution of the CLL cells to RS and
determine distinct patterns of genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic states at a single-cell resolution. Finally,
we will combine these data to identify molecular subtypes of RS and associate them with outcome. (2) Define
the changes in cellular circuitry associated with transformation from CLL to RS. We will use the power of
microscaled proteomic and phosphoproteomic analysis to identify changes in the wiring of cellular processes
associated with transformation to RS and create a comprehensive proteomic map of RS. We will identify
deregulated signaling pathways and potential therapeutic targets. Finally, we will integrate the proteomic data to
refine the molecular subtypes identified above as well as develop a high-throughput proteomic assay for
detecting biomarkers of these subtypes and validate them in an independent set of RS patients. (3) Develop a
non-invasive tool for RS detection and monitoring. Building on our understanding of the RS genome, we will build
a robust and inexpensive cell-free DNA assay based on low-pass whole-genome sequencing aimed at detecting
RS-specific alterations in plasma samples. We will test whether we can detect RS clones in patients' blood to
monitor the emergence, progression and relapse of RS. Together, these Aims will create the first comprehensive
atlas of RS, identify key pathways and potential therapeutic targets and build tools that could impact clinical
decision making."
10912494,"Abstract
Richter's Syndrome (RS) arises from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and has long been acknowledged as
presenting a bleak clinical outlook for CLL patients. New treatment combinations, however, incorporating novel
agents suggest the feasibility of achieving deeper and longer-lasting remissions in patients with RS. These
include treatment with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB; -PD1 therapy) together with ibrutinib, and
combination of the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax with chemotherapy. These experiences provide encouraging
developments for an entity hitherto considered a death sentence for CLL patients. Despite these promising
therapeutic developments, little information is available regarding the determinants of clinical response to these
therapies. The recent increase in clinical investigation of novel therapeutic agents for RS now provides an
opportunity to more consistently collect biospecimens. Moreover, the recent availability of novel sequencing
capabilities, analytic tools and animal models (generated by our efforts over this past funding period) now enable
us to maximally extract information about the diverse molecular and phenotypic features of RS from primary
patient material. We hypothesize that therapeutic response and resistance to RS therapy are shaped by
both tumor-intrinsic and -extrinsic features, and that these features underlie the differential sensitivity
to novel agents between RS and CLL. Herein, we will undertake in-depth analysis of specimens collected on
therapeutic trials, focusing on longitudinal analyses of both RS specimens and their microenvironment, and also
functional validation of these findings in a novel animal model. These studies are supported by strong interactions
with Projects 1 and 3, and each of the individual Cores. Our aims are thus to: (i) Define the RS-intrinsic features
that govern responses to RS therapies. We will evaluate the molecular characteristics of serially collected RS
specimens from patients treated with: (i) BCL2 inhibitor-based and (ii) ICB-based therapy, and link these
attributes with clinical features to identify markers/pathways predictive of response or resistance to therapy. (ii)
Delineate the key components of the RS immune microenvironment impacting therapeutic response. New
immunogenomic approaches enable us to gain fresh mechanistic insights directly from analyzing patient
samples. We will perform scRNA-seq profiling of marrow or lymph node-infiltrating immune cells from RS
responders and nonresponders per therapy (enrolled on the aforementioned trials) to systematically characterize
the composition and functional state of cellular populations participating in response or resistance to novel RS
therapeutic combinations. Finally, we will: (iii) Model differential therapeutic sensitivity of RS to -PD1 therapy
compared to CLL. Using novel genetically engineered mouse models that reflect CLL or RS disease, we will
perform in vivo treatment studies and functional/phenotypic analyses of immune cells to determine the genetic
and microenvironmental basis of RS response to ICB compared to CLL."
10912507,"Summary (30 lines, broad, long-term)
With the advent of more effective therapies in CLL, there is a greater priority on identifying better treatment of
Richter's Syndrome (RS), as this has become one of the most important unmet medical needs to address for
CLL patients. The main goals of this Project are to utilize functional precision medicine techniques to better
understand biological vulnerabilities in Richter's cells and to identify novel pharmacologic interventions to
increase apoptotic signaling in these cells. Our priority is on the direct study of viable samples from RS patients
obtained in collaboration with the Biospecimens core. We seek to identify the most promising combinations to
subsequently explore in early phase clinical trials for patients with RS, funded by other mechanisms. The job
of precision medicine is to match the right patient to the right drug. A strategy of genomic sequencing has
yielded several successes, such as treating EGFR mutant lung cancer with EGFR inhibitors; however, to date
RS has not yielded to the identification of targetable genetic abnormalities, and this will be the focus of Project
1. In Project 3, we propose an alternative approach, which we call functional precision medicine. Rather than
rely on static -omic data, we propose to perturb cellular function in ways that allow us to identify active drugs.
Central to this strategy is BH3 profiling, a technique in which we expose mitochondria from living cells to
synthetic BH3 peptides and measure mitochondrial permeabilization. From this assay we can learn which anti-
apoptotic proteins the cell relies on for survival, whether BCL-2, BCL-XL, MCL-1, some combination thereof, or
none of these proteins. This information has direct translational application, as clinical BH3 mimetic inhibitors
of all three listed proteins now exist. In fact, BH3 profiling was used to direct therapy of the BCL-2 inhibitor
venetoclax to CLL and AML, two indications for which venetoclax has now received FDA approval. We
propose to use BH3 profiling to identify which BH3 mimetic(s) would be most active in RS. BH3 profiling can
also provide a summary measure of how close a cell is to the threshold of apoptosis. When coupled with a
brief preceding drug exposure, dynamic BH3 profiling (DBP) can identify drugs from any class that induce
apoptotic signaling in cancer cells, moving them closer to the threshold of apoptosis. We have previously
demonstrated in several liquid and solid tumor contexts that this strategy accurately identifies drugs with in vivo
activity for individual tumors, and can predict clinical response in patients. We propose to use DBP to identify
active drugs, after which we will explore their use in combination with each other and with the appropriate BH3
mimetics identified above. As we identify drug vulnerabilities for the panel of RS samples to be studied in this
Project, we will compare them with clinical, genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic annotations prepared by
other Projects and Cores in this P01. We hope to use this information to gain insight into the upstream
signaling mechanisms that drive drug-induced apoptotic signaling."
10873221,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC) is expressed ubiquitously in vertebrate cells where it
mediates the efflux of Cl- and organic solutes required for cell volume regulation, an essential physiological
process. VRACs are activated and inactivated by cell swelling and shrinkage, respectively. They also detect
changes in intracellular ionic strength, which modifies their sensitivity to cell volume changes. VRACs and the
genes that encode them are implicated in multiple diseases including diabetes, obesity, cancer and immunity.
 Whole genome RNA interference screening led to the demonstration in 2014 that VRACs are encoded
by five members of the Lrrc8 gene family, Lrrc8a–e. VRAC/LRRC8 channels are hexaheteromers and
require co-assembly of the essential subunit LRRC8A with one or more other LRRC8 proteins. Subunit
assembly order and stoichiometry are unknown.
 Cryo-electron microscopy (EM) structures of homomeric LRRC8A and LRRC8D channels were
recently determined. However, LRRC8A and LRRC8D homomers do not exist in Nature. Furthermore,
LRRC8A homomeric channels have non-native functional properties and LRRC8D channel properties are
undefinable because they are not trafficked to the plasma membrane. Existing cryo-EM structures thus have
limitations for understanding VRAC/LRRC8 structure-function relationships. Directly translating LRRC8A and
LRRC8D cryo-EM structural information into functional understanding is further constrained by the unknown
and likely variable stoichiometry and assembly of hexaheteromeric VRAC/LRRC8 channels.
 Our laboratory, funded by DK51610, has studied VRAC extensively and was the first to demonstrate
many of the channel's unique functional properties. Most recently, we described novel LRRC8 chimeric
channel constructs that allow detailed molecular study of homomeric channels with physiologically
relevant functional properties and defined stoichiometry and assembly. Our chimera studies uniquely
demonstrated that 1) the LRRC8A intracellular loop, IL1, has unique structural features, 2) it is required for cell
volume sensing, 3) the LRRC8 C-terminus is required for sensing changes in intracellular ionic strength and 4)
both the LRRC8A IL1 and C-terminus are required for correct cellular processing of VRAC/LRRC8 channels.
 The overarching goal of this R01 renewal application is to utilize these novel LRRC8 chimeras to better
elucidate VRAC/LRRC8 channel structure-function relationships. We will characterize the roles of the
LRRC8A C-terminus in VRAC/LRRC8 channel regulation and will test the hypothesis that the LRRC8 IL1
determines VRAC/LRRC8 channel pore properties and regulates channel gating. We will also determine the
cryo-EM structure of a unique LRRC8 chimera in multiple physiologically relevant conformations. Our studies
will provide novel insights into the regulation and function of VRAC/LRRC8 channels and will provide a higher
confidence foundation for detailed mutagenesis-based structure-function analyses."

The goal of this K01 application is to provide an individualized program of mentored research training for Dr.
Deanna Saylor, an Assistant Professor in the Department of Neurology at the Johns Hopkins University School
of Medicine. Dr. Saylor has been based full-time in Zambia since 2018 where, in collaboration with local
stakeholders, she has launched the first neurology inpatient unit and first neurology post-graduate training
program in the country. Dr. Saylor is applying for an International Research Scientist Development Award to
gain skills and experience in implementation science research. Combined with her background in clinical and
epidemiological research, this new skillset will uniquely position her to both generate new knowledge and help
develop care systems that effectively implement new knowledge to improve patient outcomes. The research
plan outlined in this application leverages the developing system of neurological care in Zambia to understand
current stroke care practices at the University Teaching Hospital (UTH; Zambia's national referral hospital),
develop locally relevant stroke clinical practice guidelines, and examine the effect of their implementation on
stroke outcomes. Since stroke is the second leading cause of adult disability and mortality worldwide and
stroke prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa is amongst the highest in the world, these data are urgently needed to
address this national, regional, and global health problem. The proposed research includes a pre-intervention
prospective cohort of patients with stroke at UTH to characterize current stroke care clinical practices and
stroke outcomes (aim 1). A stroke working group including relevant stakeholders will then be convened to
investigate community, patient, provider, and health systems factors leading to difficulty achieving stroke
quality measures and optimal outcomes. The Adopt-Contextualize-Adapt framework will then be used to
develop locally relevant clinical practice guidelines from international stroke guidelines for implementation (aim
2). These guidelines will then be implemented, and a post-intervention observational cohort study conducted
to examine their impact on achieving stroke quality measures and improving stroke outcomes. This K01 will
also support Dr. Saylor's training goals which include gaining additional training and mentorship in the following
key areas: (1) implementation science frameworks and methodology; (2) qualitative data methods and
analysis; (3) stroke clinical research methods, especially aspects unique to global settings; and (4) developing
an international network of collaborators for future large-scale and generalizability studies. In order to achieve
these goals, Dr. Saylor has established an international team of mentors with expertise in implementation
science, qualitative studies, stroke research, neurology research in sub-Saharan Africa, and stroke center
development in international settings. This award will provide Dr. Saylor with the mentorship, knowledge, and
experience necessary to become an independent investigator in global neurology conducting clinical and
implementation research to improve outcomes for patients with stroke and other neurologic disorders."
10894922,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Current treatment options for Alport syndrome are extremely limited: Alport syndrome is a hereditary
orphan disease arising from defects in the collagen IV α3α4α5 heterotrimer, and it invariably results in chronic
kidney disease (CKD). A kidney transplant is the definitive cure for CKD arising from Alport syndrome, but the
need for kidney donors far exceeds the availability. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade,
such as the drug ramipril, is the pharmacological mainstay used to treat CKD in patients with Alport syndrome.
Bardoxolone methyl (BdMe) is a promising investigational drug that is very close to being approved to treat
Alport syndrome. Nevertheless, developing additional therapies for Alport syndrome is critically important.
 Farnesoid X receptor (FXR): FXR is a nuclear receptor that is highly expressed in the kidneys, liver,
adrenals, small intestines, and vasculature. It is endogenously activated by bile acids. Obeticholic acid (OCA)
is a specific FXR agonist that is already approved by the FDA. Thus, OCA could be repurposed to treat
Alport syndrome if it is shown to be effective. Importantly, OCA has been shown to be protective in many other
models of chronic kidney disease.
 The OVERARCHING GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL is to investigate OCA as a novel treatment for Alport
syndrome using a transgenic mouse model. We will test the hypothesis that OCA treatment, with or without
coadministration of either ramipril or BdMe, is nephroprotective in a mouse model of Alport syndrome. These
combinations were chosen in part because evidence in other models of kidney disease suggests that OCA
may work through similar pathways as ramipril and BdMe. Thus, it is plausible that OCA could potentiate the
beneficial effects of ramipril and BdMe. This may occur independently of any other beneficial effects of OCA.
 In addition, we will investigate levels of FXR and its well-defined target genes in renal biopsies from
patients with Alport syndrome. Label-free imaging will be performed to quantify fibrosis and metabolism, and
their correlation with FXR expression will be investigated with spatial resolution within the same biopsy.
Correlations will also be sought between these data and the clinical metadata associated with each biopsy."

The germline is dedicated to produce gametes that transmit genetic and epigenetic information to the next
generation. Maintenance of germ cells and development of gametes require germ granules—well-conserved
membraneless and RNA-rich organelles. The composition and function of germ granules remain elusive owing
to their dynamic nature and their exclusive expression in the germline. This project addresses three
fundamental questions. How are germ granules assembled and maintained? How are the epigenetic
regulators, such as small RNAs, amplified in germ granules and passed on to offspring? What is impact of
granules on gene regulatory networks and transgenerational inheritance? This proposal uses C. elegans germ
granules as a model system to define their proteome and RNAome. The goal is to identify protein and RNA
components that are required for germ granule formation, and characterize their role in germline maintenance
and embryogenesis. Furthermore, the genetic and biochemical approaches afforded by C. elegans will be used
to determine the mechanisms that drive the production of small RNAs within germ granules. By characterizing
their constituents, this research program will advance our understanding of mechanisms of germ granule
formation and their function in fertility."
10929403,"Regulation of Tissue Growth and Morphogenesis by Fat Cadherins
Project Summary
Formation of optimally functioning organs of appropriate size and shape requires precise coordination of growth
and morphogenesis during development. The evolutionarily conserved cell adhesion molecules Dachsous and
Fat coordinately regulate tissue growth and patterning by influencing Hippo signaling and planar cell polarity
respectively. Mutations in these genes give rise to devastating Van Maldergem and Hennekam syndromes
characterized by congenital developmental defects of multiple organ systems. Further, mutations in these genes
are also implicated in several cancers. However, there are critical gaps in our understanding of how they regulate
growth and morphogenetic processes. We know little about how the spatial organization of the pathway is
established and maintained and how the Ds-Fat junctions get coordinately remodeled to allow morphogenesis.
Further, we lack a coherent view of how this pathway regulates Hippo signaling. Lastly, it is not clear how Fat
regulates organ shape. To address these critical gaps, we will use the fruit fly Drosophila, which provides a
robust model system to study this pathway. Our recent work has identified several novel regulators of this
pathway and uncovered some intriguing findings, which suggest that vesicular trafficking provides an important
layer of regulation in organization of the Fat signaling pathway, an aspect that has been overlooked so far. We
will investigate how an intricate interplay between the endocytic machinery and a competitive inhibitor plays a
critical role in organization of this pathway. Further, we will investigate how the Ds-Fat junctions get remodeled
by endocytosis in a mechanosensitive manner to allow morphogenesis. We have identified a key regulatory motif
in the Fat cytoplasmic domain and its interactors, which play an important role in Fat recycling to the plasma
membrane. We will characterize how this motif regulates Fat localization at the plasma membrane. Additionally,
we will investigate how Fat regulates Hippo signaling through the atypical myosin Dachs. Finally, we will examine
how Fat signaling affects the key morphogen gradients and conduct live imaging combined with quantitative
image analysis to identify the key cellular rearrangements that mediate organ shape alterations in Fat mutants.
These studies will provide novel mechanistic insight into Fat signaling pathway and address several longstanding
questions in the field and will help explain the developmental disorders resulting from dysregulation of this
pathway."

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the major cause of visual impairment and blindness
in persons >65 years of age in the United States and the 3rd leading cause of blindness
worldwide. Several lines of evidence implicate immune activation and inflammation in the
pathogenesis of AMD, including biomarkers of systemic inflammation as risk factors for
AMD, complement deposition in drusen, complement and chemokine genetic polymorphisms as
risk factors for AMD and circulating activated monocytes in patients with AMD. Antiretroviral
(ART)-treated, immune-restored, HIV-infected persons have accentuated and accelerated
aging, an age-adjusted shortened lifespan due to age-related diseases, and immune system
changes similar to those seen in >70 year-old HIV-uninfected persons (immunosenescence).
Data from the Longitudinal Study of the Ocular Complications of AIDS (LSOCA) cohort show an
~4-fold increased prevalence and a 1.75-fold increased incidence of intermediate-stage AMD
vs. that seen in HIV-uninfected cohorts. Preliminary data from LSOCA suggest that monocyte
activation and systemic inflammation are risk factors for AMD. Cryopreserved blood specimens
from LSOCA will be evaluated for inflammatory biomarkers and chemokines as risk factors for
AMD, using nested case-control design and time-updated analyses. Blood biomarkers and
chemokines evaluated will be those known to be operative in ART-treated, HIV-infected persons
and in HIV-uninfected older persons focusing on those related to monocyte activation.
Biomarkers identified as relevant to AMD in the LSOCA cohort will be evaluated in HIV-
uninfected persons using cryopreserved specimens from the Age-Related Eye Disease Study
(AREDS) cohort. Levels of biomarkers and chemokines will be correlated with AMD risk gene
polymorphisms in both cohorts. A discovery-based approach will be used to identify plasma
proteomic risk factors for AMD in both the LSOCA and AREDS cohorts. These studies will lead
to an improved understanding of the roles of inflammation, immune activation, and immune-
senescence in the pathogenesis of AMD and of the biology of aging."
10914138,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Understanding the mechanisms of gene and chromatin regulation and their roles within a
multicellular organism has relevance across many disciples such as synthetic biology, medicine,
developmental biology and neuroscience 1–3. Large-scale efforts of the genomics community
have identified many of the functional genes and gene regulatory elements (GREs) including
recent atlases with the specific expression of genes and their putative regulatory regions within
different cell types of complex tissues 4,5. However, it remains unclear how the 3D organization
of chromatin impacts gene regulation and vice versa. To build a mechanistic understanding of
the interplay between chromatin organization and gene regulation, we would ideally
simultaneously measure all the key elements - DNA sequences, regulatory proteins, and the
transcribed RNA - at the genomic-scale, while maintaining information about cell type identity.
To address this challenge, I will develop an imaging platform that can simultaneously measure
the 3D structure of DNA together with the RNA expression of the regulated genes and their
interaction with key structural proteins (Aim 1). While this method can be applied to many
systems, a particularly suited example is the peripheral olfactory system. Olfaction, one of the
main mammalian senses, is controlled by the largest family of genes comprising more than
1000 olfactory receptors 6,7. Large networks of regulatory sequences interact across the
genome to establish more than 1000 neuronal types, each expressing one and only one
receptor8. I will apply this imaging method to address the longstanding question: how do
different olfactory sensory neurons establish their receptor expression? These integrated
measurements relating chromatin organization and regulatory protein structures to
transcriptional activity will provide a model of olfactory gene regulation. Aim 2, is to dissect this
model and the roles of GRE-promoter interactions in achieving cell-type specific expression
using a high-throughput synthetic biology approach. I will infect the olfactory epithelium with
large pools of viral vectors that combine different regulatory elements and promoters, and
determine the precise cell-type expression of these vectors using multiplexed imaging. There is
an additional synergy between the two aims - the first aim provides measurements of the
endogenous chromatin structure-transcription relationship which will be used to design
transgenic control of specific subpopulation of cells. I will explore this capability to
activate/inhibit specific sub-populations of olfactory receptor neurons and determine the
behavior consequences of these manipulations."
10909225,"Project Summary/Abstract
Southeast Asia remains a global hotspot for emerging zoonotic infectious diseases. The recent
increase in transmission of the monkey malaria parasite Plasmodium knowlesi, endemic to
Southeast Asia, exemplifies how land-use change can drive disease spill-over to humans. In
Malaysia, P. knowlesi now accounts for the vast majority of malaria cases and is the
predominant cause of malaria-related deaths. Recent reports suggest that P. knowlesi is also the
predominant species in parts of western Indonesia, and that due to misidentification by microscopy,
under-diagnosis is likely widespread across the region. Molecular surveillance is essential for
monitoring the emergence of zoonotic P. knowlesi, informing malaria control strategies, and
assessing progress towards elimination of the human-only malaria species.
In this study in Sabah, Malaysia, we firstly plan to further improve molecular state-wide malaria
surveillance detection systems to monitor for changing epidemiological and clinical features of
disease, including in pregnancy, which potentially could occur with adaption of P. knowlesi to
human-human transmission. We will supplement these data with targeted longitudinal health
facility surveys of healthy and febrile attendees to understand the true burden of asymptomatic or
submicroscopic P. knowlesi infections, in addition to screening for other simian malaria species
such as P. cynomolgi. A high-throughput multiplex serological malaria surveillance platform will
also be used to integrate recently developed novel antigens targeting P. knowlesi. This platform
will enable evaluation of population-level markers of P. knowlesi exposure and transmission
intensity in the context of potential waning cross-species immunity from other human malaria
species, and allow concurrent assessment of other public health priorities including SARS-CoV-2.
Secondly, recent advances in multiplexed deep targeted sequencing of microhaplotypes offer
potential advantages if these tools are adapted for P. knowlesi. Our previous surveillance study
collected >5500 P. knowlesi isolates, and we plan to develop novel genome-based tools to evaluate
P. knowlesi population structure at sufficient resolution to understand increasing transmission and
disease severity in Sabah, and relate these findings to elsewhere in Southeast Asia. Finally, we will
also use an updated georeferenced database of state-wide P. knowlesi cases over time to
characterise changing fine spatial scale incidence patterns, and to generate regional predictive P.
knowlesi risk mapping incorporating environmental remote-sensing satellite data and predicted
human, monkey and mosquito population distributions to inform and guide planning, surveillance
and prevention activities in other countries in the region at risk of P. knowlesi transmission."

(iii) Develop a collaboration with the Puerto Rico Department of Health to build capacity for
microbial resistance detection and improvement in outreach response; (iv) Develop an outreach
program before the end of the third quarter of PY-1 aimed at providing support to public health
organizations and empowering communities on antibiotic resistance and its impact on food supply.
Through this project, we will establish a collaboration with the Pennsylvania Department of Health
and the Pennsylvania State University, which will serve as models and provide training for the
success of the PR-ARS. Analyses of integrated genomics data from food and human sources will
also enhance surveillance for antimicrobial resistance in enteric bacteria. PR-ARS will generate

 The Rutgers CounterACT Center Pharmacology and Drug Development Core facilitates the development of
therapeutics for treatment of skin, cornea and lung injury resulting from exposure to two high priority chemical
threat agents, sulfur mustard and nitrogen mustard. This Core have been working closely with Center
investigators to identify, characterize and prioritize drug candidates, evaluate the toxicological profile and
pharmacokinetic properties of lead drug candidates, and determine optimal drug delivery approaches, with the
aim of generating data to support Investigational New Drug (IND) applications and clinical trials. The Core is
organized into four focus teams, each serving a specific function critical to drug development: Preclinical
Efficacy, ADME and Toxicology, Regulatory Affairs, and Translation to Advanced Drug Development. The
current pipeline coordinated by the Core includes modulators of inflammatory targets including matrix
metalloproteinases (doxycycline) TNFα (anti-TNFα antibody), and COX-2/cholinesterase (AIDNX, NDH4338)
that will reduce injury and/or promote healing of the lung, cornea, or skin following exposure to mustards. Drug
products are rapidly progressing with several approaching readiness to transition to advanced development
including clinical studies. These include drug products that have led to pre-IND meetings with the FDA office
on Counter-Terrorism and Emergency Coordination Staff (CTECS) and the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation
and Research (CDER). One product, Simponi® (a fully humanized anti-TNFα antibody marketed by Janssen
Pharmaceuticals), has transitioned to advanced development with BARDA funding. Working with Argentum
Biomedical, the Core has also spearheaded efforts refining a dermal minipig model for advanced development
of Silverlon®, a burn dressing that has recently been approved by the FDA for use against mustard skin injury.
The Core partners with contract research organizations and pharmaceutical companies, as well as federal
regulators to ensure the timely and efficient progression of products. In this renewal application, we propose
the advancement of a number of first generation drug products (TNFα antagonists, doxycycline, and an NSAID
prodrug) towards regulatory approval. We will continue with refinement of the minipig model for label
expansion of Silverlon®. This will be important for advanced development of other dermal countermeasures.
We will also work with Janssen Pharmceuticals to refine a sulfur mustard vapor inhalation model of lung injury.

Project Summary/Abstract
 Mustard vesicants, including sulfur mustard (2,2'-dichlorodiethyl sulfide, SM) and nitrogen mustard
(bis(2-chloroethyl)methylamine, HN2) are cytotoxic blistering agents synthesized for chemical warfare.
Because they contain highly reactive electrophilic chloroethyl side chains, they readily react with cellular
macromolecules like DNA forming monofunctional and bifunctional adducts. By targeting DNA, mustards can
compromise genomic integrity by causing single and double strand breaks. Double strand breaks are
particularly toxic because they disrupt the physical continuity of the DNA duplex. To protect against
genotoxicity following exposure to mustards, cells initiate a DNA damage response (DDR). This involves
activation of signaling cascades including ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated), ATR (ataxia telangiectasia and
Rad3-related) and DNA-PKcs (DNA-dependent protein kinase, catalytic unit). Signaling induced by the DDR
leads to the recruitment and activation of repair related proteins such as phospho H2AX and phospho p53 to
sites of DNA lesions. As a transcriptional activator, p53 can also induce DNA repair proteins, it can also
interact with many signaling pathways including those important in cell cycle control and apoptosis. Excessive
DNA modifications by mustards can overwhelm DNA repair leading to cytotoxicity and tissue damage. Herein
we will investigate DDR signaling pathways induced by mustard vesicants in human keratinocytes and in
mouse skin. Two FDA approved drugs, Enoxacin and Amifostine, reported to enhance DNA repair, will be
analyzed for their ability to enhance DDR signaling in keratinocytes. Investigations into mechanisms by which
Enoxacin and Amifostine enhance DNA repair and potentially protect against cytotoxicity may lead to the
development of a novel class of mustard countermeasures."

Project Lead: Marion K. Gordon, Ph.D.
Co-Investigator: Laurie B. Joseph, Ph.D.
Project Summary/Abstract
Mustard vesicants including sulfur mustard (SM) and nitrogen mustard (NM) cause a range of debilitating
injures to human eyes that can lead to long term pathologies and blindness. In previous studies we
demonstrated that mustard injury is due in part to separation of the corneal epithelium from the stroma;
moreover, this is a consequence of activation of proteases including matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and the
endopeptidase, ADAM17, which degrade essential epithelial cell anchoring proteins. During the last grant
period, we demonstrated that doxycycline, an inhibitor of MMPs, was effective in blunting the toxicity of both
NM and SM in cultured corneas, and in a rabbit SM vapor model of corneal injury. Based on our findings, two
pre-IND meetings were held with the FDA, and an ocular drug product, oxytetracycline, is currently moving
towards advanced development. Expression of MMP9 and ADAM17 is induced by EMMPRIN (Extracellular
Matrix Metalloproteinase Inducer, CD147), a transmembranous glycoprotein synthesized by epithelial cells.
The ligand for EMMPRIN is cyclophilin A, which is released from cells in response to injury or oxidative stress.
Following mustard exposure, we found that EMMPRIN is markedly upregulated in the cornea, suggesting a
potential target for therapeutic intervention. The immunosuppressive agent cyclosporine A (CsA) has been
shown to inhibit cyclophilin A activity at nanomolar concentrations. We discovered that Restasis®, a CsA
emulsion, is effective in blocking epithelial detachment after exposure of the cornea to NM. Moreover, it
reduced MMP9 expression in the cornea. These exciting findings suggest that Restasis® has potential to be
developed as an ocular countermeasure against mustards. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that
mustard induced oxidative stress in the cornea causes the release of cyclophilin A from corneal epithelial cells
which upregulates EMMPRIN; this results in increases in proteases which cause epithelial-stromal separation;
EMMPRIN also dysregulates expression of provisional matrix proteins (e.g., SPARC, hevin, fibronectin). As a
consequence, there is delayed wound healing and persistent epithelial injury which ultimately leads to chronic
disease. To test this hypothesis, plans are to: (1) Analyze the effects of mustard vesicants on EMMPRIN
expression in the cornea; (2) Assess the effects of mustard vesicants on deposition of provisional matrix
molecules in the cornea; and (3) Determine whether blocking cyclophilin A-induced activation EMMPRIN
suppresses mustard-induced corneal damage. Results of our studies will elucidate mechanisms mediating
mustard vesicant-induced corneal injury which will lead to the identification of new efficacious therapeutics for
mitigating toxicity."

investigators generating proposals concerning PD research. Finally, in conjunction with a Community Outreach
Board, the Core will plan and implement the Center’s active outreach program (Aim 3). Outreach activities will
include lectures at PD support group meetings and other public teaching sessions, as well as an annual
outreach event which will be organized in a small-group format, allowing patients and caregivers to learn about
ongoing PD research within the Udall Center and across the Emory campus. Many of these outreach activities
will utilize partnerships with local and national PD organizations. Serving all three aims, the Core will maintain
the Center’s website. The Core’s activities will benefit greatly from existing University attributes and resources,
such as the University’s traditional focus on basal ganglia research, with multiple ‘systems’ oriented
researchers on campus, the presence of very active undergraduate and graduate training programs in
Neuroscience and related fields, a robust slate of academic services for postdoctoral fellows, and the presence
of one of the largest movement disorder programs in the US. The Core’s three aims will also be strongly
supported by internal financial contributions, generously contributed by several stakeholders at Emory
University, in recognition of the importance of the Center’s contributions."
10930864,"Project Summary – Research Services Core (Core B)
The Research Services Core (Core B) will be an essential part of the Emory Udall Center. The Core will have
three functions: (1) to prepare and process the brain tissue from experimental animals generated by the Center’s
projects, (2) to treat Rhesus monkeys systemically with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)
and evaluate the resulting parkinsonism in a standardized manner, and (3) to provide biostatistical services and
consultation for all projects in the Center. The Core will provide standardized histology services to researchers
using animal models of parkinsonism (projects 1-3). These services will include the use of immunohistochemical
and microscopy approaches to evaluate the degree of dopamine depletion in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) or
MPTP-treated animals (projects 1-3); histological reconstructions of recording electrode trajectories (projects 1
and 2); analysis of the degree and pattern of expression of transgenes (opsins, fluorescent proteins or voltage
sensors) after virus injections (projects 1-3). These services will be indispensable to interpret the functional
experiments and will help to compare and share the results among the projects. Similarly, all MPTP-treated
parkinsonian monkeys that will be used in projects 2 and 3 will be treated and evaluated using standardized
procedures by Core B personnel. This will help to integrate and compare data generated from these projects.
Finally, the Core will provide the services of a biostatistician that will advise and provide feedback on statistical
aspects of the projects. All four projects in the Udall Center will have access to these services, from the
conception and design of the experiments to the statistical analysis of experimental data. By providing these
services, the Core will help to free up time and resources from the research projects. In addition, center research
will benefit from the use of standardized, well-establish anatomical and behavioral assessment techniques, and
the biostatistical support will promote rigor and reproducibility in all projects."
10930868,"Project Summary – Clinical Core (Core C)
The proposed Clinical Core (Core C) will support project 4 of the Emory Udall Center in its studies of the inter-
actions between the prefrontal cortex and the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in response inhibition functions in
patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) who undergo deep brain stimulation (DBS) lead implantation procedures
targeting the STN. The prefrontal cortex plays a central role in PD-associated cognitive and behavioral changes,
particularly in executive functions, such as response inhibition. The Core will provide coordinator services for
the project 4 studies. In addition to research activity, documentation of completed assessments, and coordinat-
ing the completion of detailed cognitive assessments, the Core focuses on patient recruitment and retention
strategies. The Core will leverage the active DBS program at Emory to recruit well-characterized PD patients
who are undertaking the DBS selection process (Aim 1), with the goal of recruiting 40 such patients for pre-
operative assessments, including detailed neuropsychological testing and motor evaluations in addition to the
testing during response inhibition tasks that will be done under project 4. Recruitment activities will include
various advertising strategies through flyers distributed in the clinic, web and social media advertising, as well
as public presentations. Of the recruited PD patients, 15 will also be tested in the OR during DBS lead implan-
tation, and 20 will have a repeat outpatient assessment 6-12 months post-surgery. In addition, the Core will
recruit 40 well-characterized age- and sex-matched healthy controls through a collaboration with various existing
sources, including the Clinical Core of the Emory Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC), and the Emory
Healthy Brain Study (Aim 2). These individuals will undergo the same series of tests as the PD cohort at visit 1.
To ensure continuity, all neuropsychological assessments will be overseen by one of the Udall Center’s Co-Is
who also functions as co-leader of the ADRC clinical core. The Core will communicate the results of individual
and group test results to all study participants. Finally, the Core will develop and maintain a REDCap database
of data collected in project 4 (Aim 3)."

10886781,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Epigenetic therapy aims to reprogram gene expression in cancer cells to achieve a therapeutic effect. To date,
DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibition (DNMTi) is the most effective form of epigenetic therapy, being
particularly active in myeloid leukemias. Using a live cell assay to screen for drugs that achieve the same degree
of epigenetic reprogramming as DNMTi, we discovered a new class of epigenetic drugs that activate silenced
expression through inhibition of CDK9. Cyclin Dependent Kinases (CDKs) are of considerable clinical interest in
cancer therapy and fall into two classes – cell cycle regulatory (e.g. CDK1,2,4,6 etc.) and transcriptional
regulators (e.g. CDK7,9,12 etc.). Our new data place CDK9 at the heart of a node that regulates both gene
silencing and activation. Targeting CDK9 has pleotropic effects on gene expression that appear ideal from an
anti-tumor perspective: One observes simultaneous gene activation (of tumor suppressors), repression (of
oncogenes), and induction of an interferon immune signature, which may be immunosensitizing for cancer
therapy. This latter effect is of particular interest given the phenomenal recent development of immune based
therapies, and our preliminary data suggest that CDK9 targeting may be a useful new approach to
immunosensitization. Interestingly, CDK9 may not be the only CDK involved in immune regulation. Inhibition of
CDK4/6 and of CDK5 have been shown to induce an IFN response and/or to be immunosensitizing in cancer
therapy. Moreover, other transcriptional CDKs (e.g. CDK7) share phosphorylation targets with CDK9, raising the
possibility that they also similarly affect gene silencing. Given that drugs that target CDK4 and/or 6 are in clinical
use in breast cancer, and drugs targeting CDK7 and/or 9 are in clinical trials, it becomes important to know
whether other CDKs are also immunosensitizing epigenetic regulators. Epigenetic effects may lead to different
strategies for clinical development of these drugs (e.g. low doses rather than MTD, expectation of slow responses
that take multiple cycles to occur, etc.) and for the design of combination strategies (combined epigenetic
therapy, combinations with immune checkpoint inhibitors etc.). This project therefore aims to test the hypothesis
that targeting CDKs leads to immunosensitizing epigenetic effects. We will confirm this hypothesis and test
mechanisms and clinical/translational implications for cancer therapy in three aims: (i) Immunosensitization by
CDK9 inhibition, in which we will study mechanisms and potential ways to enhance the effects; (ii) Epigenetic
effects of CDKs, in which we will ask whether targeting CDK4,5,6 and 7 has similar epigenetic and
immunosensitizing effects as targeting CDK9; and (iii) Preclinical studies and a clinical trial of combined CDK9
inhibition, DNMT inhibition and Immune checkpoint inhibition in AML and MDS, in which we will complete the
necessary studies to bring CDK targeting as epigenetic therapy into the clinic, in combination with DNMT
targeting and immune checkpoint inhibition. Successful achievement of these aims will introduce a new form of
epigenetic therapy for cancer and leukemias."
10886785,"PROJECT SUMMARY
DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi), such as the FDA-approved nucleoside analog 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine
(DAC), are currently the only available clinical drugs that can reverse abnormal DNA methylation in cancer cells
and have emerged as a potential means to increase the efficacy of immunotherapy in cancer. However, the DNA
de-methylation utility of these agents, particularly in solid tumors, does not attain the desired downstream
transcriptional consequences seen in preclinical models. As such, novel therapeutic strategies to regulate DNMT
activity are urgently needed and are directly addressed in this SPORE project. Our preliminary data shows that
several clinically applied EZH1/2 inhibitors block compensatory repressive activity of PRC2 at select tumor
suppressor genes and repeat elements consequent to DNA methylation removal by DAC. Blocking this
repressive “epigenetic switch,” which we propose is a key contributor to DNMTi resistance seen in patients
treated with these drugs, may underlie an observed synergy of DNMTi+EZH1/2i to de-repress cancer-associated
genic and intergenic transcriptional silencing. Our overall goal is to define mechanisms of transcriptional synergy
and immune crosstalk consequent to DNMTi+EZH1/2i and evaluate the clinical potential of this epigenetic
therapeutic combination, alone, and as a primer to immunotherapy. To this end, we will (Aim 1) define cancer
cell-intrinsic chromatin regulatory mechanisms and cellular pathways involved in the molecular and therapeutic
effects of combined EZH1/2 and DNMT inhibition. Concurrently, we will (Aim 2) determine in mouse models of
checkpoint therapy resistant disease, the antitumor effects of combined EZH1/2 and DNMT inhibition on cancer
vs. immune cells and those dependent on interactions between the two. In addition, a proposed Phase 1 clinical
trial, inclusive of extensive correlative science endpoints, will (Aim 3) validate the impact of combination EZH1/2
and DNMT inhibitor therapy on immune-response gene signaling circuits and the tumor microenvironment across
multiple solid tumor types. Impacts of our studies include: 1) defining exploitable mechanisms of molecular
crosstalk associated with DNMTi therapy; 2) enabling effective clinical application of DNMTi+EZH1/2i therapy;
3) revealing correlative biomarkers to assess drug action in patient tumors; and 4) expanding opportunities for
checkpoint and targeted immunotherapy combinations."
10886791,"Abstract
PARP inhibitor (PARPi) resistance remains a clinical hurdle, with therapy limited to breast and ovarian cancer
(OC) patients with BRCA mutations, and some activity seen in OC patients with intact BRCA. Our preclinical
studies demonstrate that combining a hypomethylating agent (DNMT inhibitor) and the novel PARPi talazoparib
inhibited tumor growth regardless of BRCA mutation status in both breast and OC by inducing inflammasome
signaling that generates a BRCAness phenotype, synergistically causing cancer cell death. This led to a dose-
finding phase I clinical trial in TNBC funded by Pfizer and Astex and we propose a phase II trial combining a
DNMTi and PARPi in breast and OC patients with intact BRCA that includes correlative analyses in serial patient
samples and mechanistic studies in vitro and in vivo using immunocompetent mice treated with DNMTi-PARPi
combination therapy. The overall goal of this proposal is to expand the benefit of PARPi therapy to a much
larger group of patients and further dissect mechanisms of PARPi cytotoxicity and resistance. Our central
hypothesis is epigenetic therapy-inducing inflammasome signaling generates BRCAness that enhances the
efficacy of PARPi in BRCA-proficient TNBC and OC. We propose three aims. Aim 1: To test the hypothesis
that combining DNMTi + PARPi generates STING-dependent IFN and inflammasome signaling leading to
a BRCAness phenotype that increases anti-tumor immunity in the tumor microenvironment. We
hypothesize that DNMTi + PARPi activates STING and inflammasome signaling leading to BRCAness in BRCA-
proficient TNBC and OC. We will conduct mechanistic studies of factors linking immune signaling to BRCAness
phenotype, functional analysis of immune subsets in immune-competent mice treated with PARPi-DNMTi
combination. Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that DNMTi in combination with PARPi activate reactive
oxygen species (ROS)-mediated DNA damage leading to cell death in BRCA-proficient TNBC and OC.
We will investigate how ROS generated by DNMTi-PARPi combination enhances DNA damage response (DDR)
signaling, induces STING activation and enhances immune responses against TNBC and OC tumors using
immune-competent mice. Aim 3: To assess the clinical activity of DNMTi-PARPi combination in TNBC and
OC patients in phase I/II clinical trials. After completing the ongoing phase 1, we propose a phase II study in
two patient cohorts (one TNBC, one OC), serial tumor biopsies and circulating correlatives to test mechanistic
hypotheses derived from our preclinical studies in patient samples. We will probe modulation of BRCAness-
HRD, DDR genes, ROS signaling, immune signaling genes and functional analysis of immune subsets. Impact:
Combining DNMTi-PARPi to induce a novel link between STING-mediated immune signaling and direct induction
of a BRCAness-HRD phenotype represents a potentially important treatment advance and therapeutic option for
women diagnosed with TNBC and OC who lack BRCA mutations and for which there is an urgent clinical need.
Efficacy may be further enhanced by including immune checkpoint therapy to this treatment strategy."

10906178,"Immunotherapy treatments such as checkpoint blockade and chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy have
demonstrated the power of the immune system to eradicate metastatic cancer, but the efficacy of
immunotherapies in solid tumors remains confined to a minority of patients. A series of interlinked events are
needed for efficacy – including induction of immunogenic tumor cell death, recruitment of immune cells to the
tumor bed, and reversion of immunosuppressive cues in the tumor microenvironment (TME). We have
developed a therapeutic approach using intratumorally-administered synthetic lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) to
deliver self-replicating (replicon) RNAs to tumors that activate innate immune signaling pathways and potently
express therapeutic payloads. As shown in our recently published preliminary data, this approach elicited
profound anti-tumor immune responses in several tumor models, and enabled tumor regression of both
injected and distal non-injected tumors. Here we bring together a strong interdisciplinary team to build on these
initial findings and apply a synthetic biology toolkit to create next-generation LNP-replicon therapeutics, which
combine multiple features to increase the safety and efficacy of this approach, including: (1) cell classifier
circuits that allow replicon expression only in target cancer cells or immune cells, (2) optimized multi-
subgenomic promoter replicons that encode multiple payload genes expressed at tunable predefined
expression levels, and (3) small molecule-regulated replicons that allow two-stage therapeutic programs to be
implemented following a single intratumoral injection. These engineered RNAs will be combined with optimized
LNP formulations that promote efficient transfection of desired target cell types in the TME. We will apply this
technology to treat the leading cause of cancer death, lung cancer, and assess its impact using a syngeneic
mouse model of local intratumoral therapy in orthotopic and autochthonous lung cancer models that
recapitulate the TME of human lung cancers. Our specific aims are: (1) Develop formulations for cell type-
specific expression in cancer cells and T cells, (2) Create small molecule-regulated RNA circuits for cancer
cells and T cells for programmable immunogenic cancer cell death and specifically expression in T cells. (3)
Therapeutic testing of optimized replicon circuits in orthotopic lung cancer models alone and in combination.
Altogether, this proposal brings together a highly interdisciplinary team, marrying cutting edge concepts from
synthetic biology and cancer immunotherapy to achieve a more effective, safe, and scalable form of
immunotherapy."

Lewy body diseases (LBDs) are highly heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's
disease (PD), Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). LBDs are
characterized by the abnormal aggregation of the protein α-synuclein in neuronal cell bodies (Lewy Body) and
neurites which are currently considered to be the common cause of the diseases. Lewy Body deposition starts
in the caudal brainstem of PD but in the neocortex of DLB cases. The regional differences of initial α-synuclein
deposition correlate with neuronal loss in the corresponding regions - dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra
(SN) and neurons of unknown identity in the neocortex, and the unique clinical manifestations with a predominant
motor symptom in PD whereas early dementia in DLB. Why some particular neurons and brain regions are
affected at the disease onset, whereas the neighboring cells and regions not? This is a fundamental question in
the field of neurodegenerative diseases that this proposal will address via novel genomics technologies and
bioinformatics tools. In an initial pilot study, using single nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) analyses, we
identified a novel disease-associated astrocyte (DAA) subpopulation and demonstrated that DAA contributed to
increased inflammation, amyloid pathology, and neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis whereas
parenchymal astrocytes had compromised functionality in both AD and PD brains. Additionally, we identified
three microglia subpopulations that were similar to but with marker gene expression profiles distinct from the
conventional resting (M0), M1, and M2 activated microglia. We observed deficient microglia functionality shared
across all microglia subpopulations and uniquely up-regulated inflammatory pathways in PD suggesting common
and PD-specific mechanisms of neurodegeneration. These data provide us with an exclusive opportunity to
analyze the relationships between these glia subpopulations and selective regional and neuronal vulnerability in
different diseases. In Aim 1, we will identify vulnerable neuronal types in the frontal cortex (FC) and SN of patients
with PD, PDD, and DLB. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that astrocyte/microglia dysfunction underlies the
mechanism of the selective regional vulnerability of LBD. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that dysregulated
interactions between neurons and astrocytes/microglia underlie the mechanism of the selective neuronal
vulnerability of LBD. Our study will provide deep insights into the molecular mechanisms of selective neuronal
and regional vulnerability in LBDs. Besides, our study will provide molecular biomarkers and tools for neuron
cell-type-specific protection and targeted astrocyte/microglia subpopulation isolation and manipulation.
Furthermore, our study will provide molecular biomarkers for distinguishing PD, PDD, and DLB, which is very
important but a considerable challenge today."

This proposal is for a four-year research career development program, focused on the study of the
neurophysiology of fear and safety discrimination, which has relevance to anxiety disorders and post-traumatic
stress disorder. By the start of the project, the candidate will have been appointed an Instructor in the
Department of Psychiatry at Weill Cornell Medical Center. The proposal is a natural extension of the
candidate's previous research and clinical training on safety signals in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and
basolateral amygdala (BLA). It outlines a plan for the candidate to achieve his goal of becoming an expert in
the circuit mechanisms of fear and anxiety disorders, extending the training of the candidate in two dimensions,
which are reflected in the mentorship of Drs. Conor Liston and Joshua Levitz: 1. Encoding of fear and safety-
related information in large, distributed mPFC and BLA ensembles and 2. Cell-surface receptors that modulate
prefrontal output to the BLA for successful fear discrimination and represent promising pharmacological targets
for treating generalized fear. The proposed experiments and multi-faceted training plan will impart the
candidate with a unique combination of skills that will position him to transition into a successful independent
career as a physician-scientist studying the neurophysiology of fear and anxiety in psychiatric disorders.
Anxiety disorders are the most prevalent mental disorders, affecting one-fifth to one-third of the adult US
population, and the disorders are typically chronic, associated with high disease burden and significant
healthcare cost. While effective treatments exist, a substantial proportion of patients are minimally responsive,
underpinning the need to develop therapeutics that work through different cellular mechanisms. Anxiety
disorders are highly co-morbid with each other and with other psychiatric disorders, highlighting the value of
research into common neurocircuit mechanisms with trans-diagnostic relevance. Patients with PTSD or anxiety
disorders have both been found to exhibit the overgeneralization of conditioned fear, which is associated with
abnormal reactivity of the mPFC and BLA. The goal of my proposal is to investigate the encoding of fear and
safety discrimination in interconnected mPFC and BLA neurons. Specifically, this proposal investigates the role
of metabotropic glutamate receptor 2 (mGluR2) in controlling mPFC-to-BLA output by: 1. Defining high-
dimensional fear and safety encoding mechanisms in mGluR2+ and mGluR2- mPFC-BLA projectors; 2.
Elucidating fear discrimination learning-related changes in connectivity between mGluR2+ and mGluR2- mPFC
cells and functionally-distinct downstream BLA ensembles; 3. Dissecting the role of mGluR2 signaling
specifically at mPFC-BLA presynaptic terminals in fear discrimination learning. Collectively, these experiments
provide novel insight into the neurophysiology of fear and safety discrimination in the mPFC-BLA circuit and
investigate mGluR2 as a potential therapeutic target for anxiety disorders and PTSD."
10892853,"ABSTRACT
In recent decades, the primary setting for oncology treatment has shifted from the hospital inpatient unit to the
outpatient clinic, leaving nearly 4.6 million family caregivers responsible for most of the day-to-day, round-the-
clock cancer care provided in the United States. Cancer caregiving often occurs in a highly stressful emotional
and social context, leaving caregivers vulnerable to significant, potentially long-lasting, adverse effects.
Although palliative care teams are ideally positioned to help family caregivers cope with the numerous
stressors they encounter, there is little evidence on which to base cancer caregiver support in the outpatient
palliative care clinic. To address the pressing need for research on caregiver interventions in this setting, an
interdisciplinary team of investigators will conduct a multisite, randomized trial of problem-solving therapy for
family caregivers of individuals with cancer who are receiving outpatient palliative care. Potential barriers and
facilitators to the adoption of problem-solving therapy in both rural and urban clinics will also be examined,
resulting in a greater understanding of the context in which the therapy will ultimately be delivered if shown to
be effective. The study’s specific aims are as follows: 1) determine the effect of problem-solving therapy on
psychological distress among family caregivers of patients with cancer receiving outpatient palliative care; 2)
measure the effect of problem-solving therapy on positive aspects of caregiving among family caregivers of
patients with cancer receiving outpatient palliative care; and 3) identify potential barriers and facilitators to the
adoption of problem-solving therapy for family caregivers in outpatient palliative oncology. At the conclusion of
the study, investigators will broadly disseminate findings regarding the effectiveness of problem-solving
therapy, and they will be well positioned to promote family caregiver wellbeing through the routine and
sustained delivery of problem-solving therapy in outpatient palliative cancer care."

This translational research proposal focuses on lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), an epigenetic regulator
of gene transcription. The project’s overall aim is to show that polymorphisms in LSD1 (rs587168) are involved
in blood pressure regulation and the pathophysiology of renal injury in Blacks, and that excess mineralocorticoid
receptor activity mediates these effects. The applicant will address this hypothesis using a database approach
(Aim 1) and a physiology-directed study in Black hypertensives (Aim 2). Specific Aim 1 will determine whether
Black LSD1 risk allele carriers have greater evidence of renal damage (albuminuria) than non-risk allele carriers.
The applicant will perform a cross-sectional study in 180 hypertensive Blacks (90 risk and 90 non-risk LSD1
allele carriers) from the International Hypertension Pathotype Cohort (HyperPATH) to assess whether urine
albumin/creatinine levels (marker of renal glomerular and tubular damage) and Kidney Injury Molecule-1 (marker
of renal tubular damage) are higher in Black LSD1 risk allele carriers vs non-risk allele carriers. Specific Aim 2
is a proof-of-principle physiologic study in hypertensive Black LSD1 risk allele carriers testing the hypothesis that
reductions in blood pressure will be greater with a genetically-driven anti-hypertensive approach
(mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, eplerenone) compared to a non-specific approach (amlodipine). 56
participants will be enrolled in a 12-week randomized, double-blind, active controlled, outpatient study to assess
whether eplerenone (LSD1 specific treatment) proves superior in 24-hr ambulatory systolic blood pressure
reduction than amlodipine (non-specific treatment). If Aim1 is positive, the applicant will also assess change in
urine albumin and KIM-1 levels in the longitudinal study. Successful completion of these Aims will document
whether a genetic marker, LSD1, identifies Black individuals whose blood pressure is uniquely responsive to
mineralocorticoid receptor blockade--personalized, precision medicine. Further, results of this project have the
potential to reduce Black-White disparities in health outcomes secondary to poor blood pressure control.
The training plan includes dedicated mentorship by Gordon Williams, MD (Mentor) and Gail Adler, MD, PhD (co-
Mentor), international experts in the field of cardiovascular endocrinology. In addition to Drs. Williams and Adler,
the applicant will have an advisory team composed of Bernard Rosner, PhD (statistician), Joseph Bonventre,
MD, PhD (nephrologist), and Herman Taylor, MD (cardiologist), each offering expertise tailored to the applicant’s
needs and goals. Also, the applicant will complete formal training in clinical/translational investigation, clinical
trial design, and statistics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. These activities will provide the
applicant with the necessary tools critical for development toward her goal of becoming an independent patient-
oriented investigator in the field of cardiovascular endocrinology."

The gastrin receptor, Cck2r, is a G-protein coupled receptor known to be expressed in the corpus in
enterochromaffin-like (ECL) and parietal cells where it regulates acid secretion. However, it is also expressed in
corpus progenitor cells and antral stem cells where it modulates their behavior in distinct ways. Recently, we
have shown that Cck2r+ antral cells are self-renewing +4 stem cells that undergo predominant asymmetric cell
division. However, in response to gastrin deficiency or carcinogenic injury, these antral stem cells shift to
symmetric cell division and lineage trace more rapidly, indicating that gastrin acts to regulate Cck2r+ antral cell
proliferation, and suggesting that antral G cells are niche cells. In contrast, we have shown that Cck2r+ corpus
isthmal cells are ECL cell progenitors that respond to hypergastrinemia, which acts in a hormonal fashion to
increase their proliferation and tracing, producing more ECL cells. Thus, we propose to study these two distinct
Cck2r-expressing stomach progenitor cells and dissect more deeply their responses to gastrin stimulation
through the following two Aims: Aim #1. What is the role of gastrin signaling in antral +4 stem cells? We will
investigate the role of gastrin, both in vitro and in vivo, in modulating Cck2r+ antral stem cell responses to the
major niche signals, R-spondin and Wnt, using adenovirally delivered agonists, and then validate antral gastrin
(G) cells as true niche cells through targeted DTR ablation. We will investigate the response of Cck2r+ antral
cells to both gastrin and carcinogens (MNU) using single cell RNA-sequencing. Aim #2. What is the role of
gastrin signaling in corpus ECL cell progenitors? We propose to study the effects of long-term hypergastrinemia
on Cck2r+ corpus progenitors, and also investigate the role of these isthmal progenitors in the response to corpus
inflammation (H. pylori infection) and ulceration (acetic acid injury) with or without hypergastrinemia. Finally, we
propose to characterize Cck2r+ corpus progenitors and their response to gastrin using single cell RNA-seq, in
order to understand how gastrin may modulate the plasticity and longevity of corpus progenitors. Overall, these
studies will seek to leverage the latest technologies to advance our understanding of the role of gastrin in
modulating growth and regeneration of the stomach."

schizophrenia is characterized by a combination of lower connectivity with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and
hyper-connectivity with sensorimotor cortical areas. Our findings coincided with groundbreaking discoveries in
the cognitive neuroscience of the thalamus. However, many recent advances in the fundamental neuroscience
of the thalamus have yet to translate to improved understanding of the mechanisms of psychosis phenotypes.
This translational gap is impeding progress in identifying potential treatment targets for cognitive impairment.
Progress is further hindered by limitations of conventional neuroimaging methods which are unable to directly
visualize individual thalamic nuclei in humans. This proposal provides the foundation for addressing these
challenges. Specifically, I will develop new research skills in network science (Aim 1) and the cognitive
neuroscience of the thalamus (Aim 2A), extend existing expertise in neuroimaging to include state-of-the-art
methods for imaging the human thalamus in vivo (Aim 2B), and apply these new expertise to characterize
thalamic nuclei structure and function abnormalities in early stage schizophrenia (Aim 3). This proposal will: 1)
enhance ongoing work in my lab characterizing brain connectivity in psychopathology and normal cognitive
development; and 2) provide me with critical expertise required for future studies focused on informing
thalamocortical mechanisms of psychosis phenotypes."
10687192,"ABSTRACT
Monoclonal antibody (mAbs) therapies have proven to be effective treatments for a multitude of clinical
applications. Several of these treatments require repeated administration through intravenous infusions leading
to high costs and poor patient adherence. A new field has emerged that seeks to generate mAb-secreting
plasma cell therapeutics that could be administered once to provide lifelong therapeutic mAb levels as a
therapeutic alternative. Plasma cells have high secretory capacities, can last a lifetime and are thought to be
relatively quiescent. Advances in gene editing and ex vivo B cell differentiation have enabled the ability to
generate plasma cells that secrete an exogenous mAb. However, current gene editing strategies do not fully
account for endogenous antibody expression or control for what isotype the exogenous mAb is expressed as.
Additionally, the field of gene-edited human plasma cell lacks both large and small animal models to test the
engraftment and functionality of these mAb-secreting plasma cells.
Aim 1 of this proposal will use a new gene engineering strategy to generate a human plasma cell therapeutic
that secretes an engineered IgG mAb against Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) as a proof of concept for future mAb-
secreting cell therapies. I will characterize the ability of gene-edited primary plasma cells to produce large
quantities of defined mAbs and compare to previously published methods. Human plasma cells are difficult to
engraft in small animal models due to the lack of extrinsic survival factors from human stromal and myeloid
cells. Aim 2 of this proposal will use a humanized (NSG-huCD34) mouse model to better predict the potential
engraftment potential of gene-edited plasma cells therapies. This humanized mouse model also serves as a
model for human-tropic EBV infection. I propose to validate the functionality of anti-EBV secreting plasma cells
by showing that these cells protect humanized mice against high dose intravenous EBV challenge. This would
be the first time that gene-edited primary human plasma cells were shown to protect against a human-tropic
disease in a humanized mouse model and would serve as a proof of concept for use of gene-edited plasma
cells to provide mAbs.
This project is ideal for my training as a young physician scientist due to my strong interest in translational
immunology, the complementation of my previous training in chimeric antigen receptor- modified T cell
research, the extensive background of Dr. David Rawlings and Dr. Richard James in B cell biology and
mentorship, and the quality research and medical education at the University of Washington. The activities
detailed in this proposal will provide a strong background for a future career as a physician scientist pursuing
translational immunology research."
10894135,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a common debilitating disease afflicting women throughout the world. 12.6% of
women in the United States alone will undergo a major surgery to repair POP by age 80. Current practice
supports using lightweight, knitted, wide pore polypropylene to improve the high failure rates associated with
native tissue repair. However, mesh use has been limited by complications, most commonly mesh exposure
through the vaginal epithelium and pain, occurring in ~10% of cases. Previously, using ex vivo tests and
computational models, we showed that the pore geometries of most POP meshes were markedly unstable,
easily deforming with small applications of tension, resulting in collapsed pores and wrinkling. In contrast, square
pored meshes were stable showing little deformation, translating into overall improved structural and functional
outcomes in vivo as compared to meshes with unstable geometries. However, by rotating square pored meshes
45o to an unstable diamond configuration and intentionally introducing wrinkles, we successfully reproduced
complications. Most obvious were mesh exposures associated with thinning and degeneration of the underlying
vagina indicative of stress shielding. A more subtle finding was in adjacent areas where we observed dense
collagen/matrix deposition and tissue thickening consistent with fibrosis, a plausible mechanism of pain.
Myofibroblasts, not typically present in healthy tissues, were dramatically increased in areas of mesh
deformation, particularly where fibrosis was evident, strongly suggesting that mechanical signals, occurring at a
highly local level, were a primary driver of the host response. Thus, while our previous studies had focused on
the immune response immediately in the area of the mesh fiber, we appreciated that more impactful events
driven by fibroblasts were perhaps even more critical in POP biomaterial outcomes. The overall hypothesis of
this proposal is that local stress variations induced by tensioning and physiologic loading of mesh, signal
vaginal fibroblasts toward a proliferative vs degradative response vs quiescence based on local
mechanical cues. To address this hypothesis, in Aim 1, we define the response of vaginal fibroblasts to altered
mechanical stresses imposed by mesh over time in a) an in vivo rabbit colpopexy model; and b) an in vitro model
using a functionalized synthetic tunable matrix that affords fibroblast mechanosignaling. In Aim 2, we test the
hypothesis that over tensioning a stable pore mesh has negative impact on the host response by increasing
stress variability. While high stress areas will induce myofibroblast proliferation and matrix/collagen deposition
with contraction; subphysiologic (shielded) stress areas will lead to matrix degradation and fibroblast apoptosis.
In Aim 3, we interpret findings from the previous aims in mesh removed from women with complications by
comparing the fibroblast and immune responses in normally incorporated flat mesh to that found in deformed
mesh. We advocate that defining the mechanistic basis of current complications is a key and necessary step in
the iterative process toward improving current meshes and developing future novel devices for POP repair."

 Overweight/obesity affects more than 70% of US adults creating an enormous health and
economic burden, yet effective non-invasive treatments are limited, underscoring the importance
of identifying new pharmacotherapies that promote and sustain reductions in food intake and body
weight. Amylin receptor agonists reduce food intake and body weight in both humans and animal
models, providing a platform for the development of new amylin-based pharmacotherapies to treat
obesity. Our work identifies amylin signaling in the mesolimbic reward system as a key substrate in
the control of feeding and food reward-motivated behaviors. In a series of complementary
manuscripts, we showed that ventral tegmental area (VTA) amylin receptors are essential for the
control of palatable food intake via downstream suppression of dopaminergic signaling to the
nucleus accumbens (NAc). While these combined studies highlight the VTA as a neural substrate
for amylin's control of food reward, the behavioral and physiological mechanisms, neurochemical
phenotype(s), and additional amylin modulated circuitry within the CNS that control food reward
remain unknown. As the neural control of body weight involves the contribution of many nuclei,
clearly the most effective of future amylin-based anti-obesity pharmacotherapies will be those that
act in multiple CNS sites to modulate motivated feeding. To this end, we will investigate the
hypothesis that amylin signaling within the lateral dorsal tegmental nucleus (LDTg) and the dorsal
vagal complex (DVC) of the brainstem modulate food reward by influencing VTA neural activity.
Preliminary studies also provide compelling rationale to explore endogenous amylin signaling in
the NAc in control of behaviors directed at food reward. Using innovative approaches, we will
investigate the following aims. Aim I: Investigate the endogenous contribution and underlying
neuroanatomical circuitry of LDTg and DVC amylin receptor expressing neurons in the control of
food reward. Aim II: Examine the neural activity of VTA dopaminergic and GABAergic neurons
that are downstream of DVC or LDTg amylin receptor activation. Aim III: Investigate the
contribution of amylin receptor signaling on D1 and D2 receptor expressing neurons in the NAc
in the control of food intake and modulation of food impulsivity."
10908410,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Over one-third of adults in the US have obesity, many with comorbidities including hypertension and diabetes.
Comprehensive lifestyle change is the first-line approach to treating obesity, but as many as half of patients are
non-responsive to behavior change interventions, and the majority of initial responders go on to regain lost weight
within 2 years. Pairing lifestyle intervention with an antiobesity medication (AOM) can enhance weight loss and
promote weight loss maintenance. However, despite the recent availability of several AOMs in the US, these
medications are rarely prescribed. Among the small subset of patients who do receive an AOM prescription, the
generic medication Phentermine accounts for 76% of fills. Phentermine is only approved for short-term use, while
current guidelines for treatment of obesity recommend long-term AOM prescribing. Concerns about longer-term
use of phentermine stem from the fact that it can increase heart rate and blood pressure, theoretically increasing
risk of incident cardiovascular disease. Despite these concerns, and despite the pressing need for affordable
and effective long-term obesity pharmacotherapy, there have been no high-quality, randomized controlled trials
of phentermine monotherapy to examine its efficacy, impact on risk factors, or potential adverse events if used
long-term. At 5 centers across the United States, we will conduct the Long-term Effectiveness of the Anti-obesity
medication Phentermine (LEAP) trial—a placebo-controlled, randomized trial, enrolling 1,000 adults with BMI
27-44.9kg/m2. In an intent-to-treat fashion, with all participants provided with an evidence-based online lifestyle
intervention, we will compare participants receiving 24 mg/day of phentermine vs. placebo for up to 24 months.
We will examine co-primary outcomes of percent weight loss and change in systolic blood pressure at 24 months.
Additionally, we will compare between groups changes in drivers of energy balance, including resting metabolic
rate, caloric intake, physical activity and dietary composition. Because weight loss can improve cardiometabolic
health, we will also compare changes in heart rate, hemoglobin A1c, lipids, waist circumference, atherosclerotic
cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk score, and novel ECG markers of cardiac strain. Finally, we will examine
overall adverse event and serious adverse event rate, including rates of incident cardiovascular disease or death.
The potential impact of our findings is large regardless of whether they are positive or negative. If phentermine
were shown to be safe and effective for long-term use in patients with obesity, it could provide an immediately
available low-cost option for weight management. In contrast, if shown ineffective, the trial could reduce off-label
prescribing of the medication and promote a shift to drugs with proven, albeit costly, long-term effectiveness."
10906080,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A child’s ability to walk effectively is essential to their physical health and general well-being. Unfortunately, many
children with cerebral palsy (CP), the most common cause of pediatric physical disability, have difficulty walking
and completing higher-intensity ambulatory tasks. This leads to children with CP engaging in levels of habitual
physical activity that are well below guidelines and those of children without disabilities, which in turn contributes
to many secondary conditions, including metabolic dysfunction and cardiovascular disease. There is broad
clinical consensus that plantarflexor dysfunction is a primary contributor to slow, inefficient, and crouched walking
patterns in CP; individuals with CP need more effective treatments and mobility aids for plantarflexor dysfunction.
To meet this need, this proposal aims to evaluate a holistic strategy to address impaired mobility from
plantarflexor dysfunction in CP using a lightweight, dual-mode (assistive or resistive) wearable robotic device.
This strategy combines two complementary techniques: (1) targeted ankle resistance for neuromuscular gait
training that provides precision therapy to elicit long-term improvements in ankle muscle function, and (2)
adaptive ankle assistance to make walking easier during sustained, high-intensity, or challenging tasks. The first
specific aim is to quantify improvement in ankle muscle function and functional mobility following targeted ankle
resistance gait training in ambulatory children with CP. The primary hypothesis for the first aim is that targeted
ankle resistance training will produce larger improvements in lower-extremity motor control, gait mechanics, and
clinical measures of mobility assessed four- and twelve-weeks post intervention compared to standard physical
therapy and standard gait training. The second specific aim is to determine the efficacy of adaptive ankle
assistance to improve capacity and performance during sustained, high-intensity, and challenging tasks in
ambulatory children with CP. The primary hypothesis for the second aim is that adaptive ankle assistance will
result in significantly greater capacity and performance during the six-minute-walk-test and graded treadmill and
stair stepping protocols compared to walking with ankle foot orthoses and walking with just shoes. Both Specific
Aims will explore the participant characteristics (e.g., age, gender, GMFCS level, walking speed, spasticity rating)
that are associated with the greatest improvement in outcomes following each intervention to provide guidance
for future clinical and at-home implementation. The proposed studies will establish fundamental knowledge on
the ability for adaptive ankle interventions to treat walking impairment relative to standard of care in CP."

 Zebrafish, involved in research projects totalling over 450 million dollars of NIH funding in 2020, are the
fastest growing animal model of human disease in medical research today. Thus, the health and wellbeing of
medical research fish is paramount as the rigor and repeatability of experiments depends on it. Innovation in
zebrafish husbandry systems is crucially needed because current state-of-the-art non intrusive systems only
track water quality measures. No commercial husbandry system has adopted automatic monitoring of fish
behavior using video, despite the fact that most factors crucial in assessing fish health and well being, such as
hunger, anxiety, or light changes, produce well known behavioral signatures that a computer vision system
could detect. Because many such signatures require high temporal resolution, milliseconds in the case of
escape movements, video monitoring has been hampered by the need to create and process enormous data
volumes. Here, the proposed effort aims at building upon our Phase I success of prototyping the
proof-of-concept system codenamed “CanaryTanks”. We have installed CanaryTank with sentinel zebrafish
populations directly into the racks of an existing fish facility and used our original ""Remanent Imaging""
paradigm to monitor and analyze fish swimming behavior. The system is capable of producing email reports of
basic measures of activity, sleep and feeding as well as alerts when light cycles are disrupted.
 In this Phase II effort, we will improve our initial designs with commercialization in mind. The first aim builds
on our current design to improve deployability and enhance behavior detection capabilities by capturing 3D
data with a single camera. The second aim is (1) to enhance our system’s ability to build rich email reports and
a dashboard for users to explore replay events as well as historical data, and (2) to develop advanced
detection and diagnostic algorithms using machine learning techniques. Sharing of curated data and analysis
techniques to the community is also planned in this effort. The future vision is that the CanaryTank technology
sets new standards in fish husbandry, real-time classification of complex behavior changes, and provides
revolutionary, ubiquitous in-tank recording capabilities that can be leveraged beyond husbandry for collection of
actual scientific experimental data."
10904702,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The cell envelope of Gram-negative bacteria contains two membranes, inner (IM) and outer (OM), and an
aqueous compartment termed the periplasm that is located between them. A long-term goal of my lab has always
been to understand the mechanisms of envelope biogenesis using Escherichia coli as a model system. This
proposal concerns OM biogenesis and the stress responses that maintain cell envelope physiology. All of the
components of the OM, phospholipids (PL), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), lipoproteins, and β-barrel proteins
(OMPs), are synthesized in the cytoplasm or the inner leaflet of the IM. We have identified the essential proteins
required to assemble LPS (LptABCDEFG) and OMPs (BamABCDE) in the OM and we have provided evidence
of a diffusive mechanism of phospholipid transport between the IM and the OM. In the current funding period,
we have shown that the conditional lethal phenotype of bamB bamE double mutants can be suppressed simply
by deleting a surface-exposed lipoprotein, we revealed the existence of an alternate lipoprotein trafficking
pathway, we uncovered a role for the cyclic form of Enterobacterial Common Antigen in maintaining the OM
barrier, and we identified mutations that activate or prime the σE stress response that suppress a variety of OMP
and Bam defects. In translational studies, we used our knowledge of OM biogenesis to discover a new class of
antibiotics that work to inhibit BamA at the cell surface.
We propose to use our large collection of mutations that alter the Bam components or various OMP substrates
together with our collection of suppressors as tools to probe the OMP assembly process. In particular, we will
probe the function of the non-essential BamBCE lipoproteins and test our hypothesis that BamD does not
perform a truly essential mechanistic role, but rather functions as a regulator to control the activity of BamA. We
will test the role of the chaperone Skp as a specific adaptor for the periplasmic protease DegP. We also posit
that the trimeric nature of the major OMPs functions as a global organizer of OM architecture by providing
multiple interacting faces to allow the protein-protein interactions necessary for the formation of protein islands.
Our studies on LPS assembly will utilize a mutant O-antigen ligase and the enzyme sortase to attach peptides
or proteins to LPS to challenge the capabilities of the LptDE translocon. We will also test our model that three
essential IM proteins, YejM, YciM, and FtsH comprise a novel pathway that regulates LPS synthesis in response
to the lipid status of the OM.
The mlaA* mutation destabilizes the OM by increasing LPS levels. This causes membrane loss by OM
vesiculation and IM PLs flow into the OM to replace the loss. We have identified a mutation that slows this lipid
flow and we believe that continued study of this gene may provide insights into the poorly understood process
of anterograde PL transport."
10911904,"Dynamic and correct protein synthesis by the ribosome is essential to cell’s normal function, especially in muscle
and neuron cells. The intricate ribosome internal structure and elongation factors achieve fast and faithful peptide
elongation cycles at the expenses of GTP energy. However, mechanism and cellular level regulations of this
process in healthy and diseased cells are still not clear. For example, elongation errors due to amino acid
misincorporation and frameshifting are the fundamental causes for neuron degenerative diseases,
cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and viral infections. Regulation of the human ribosome translocase eEF2 via
phosphorylation is the only known normal functional modification, making the eEF2 kinase an extremely popular
drug target. However, how this modification affects the translocation is unclear. Similarly, mutations in eEF1, the
other elongation factor, causes congenital epilepsy and intellectual disability with unclear mechanism. In addition,
dynamic RNA modifications are connected with translation regulation and antibiotic resistance. We will tackle
these problems with super-resolution force spectroscopy (SURFS) that can directly measure the ribosome
toeprinting on the mRNA at both sides flanking the ribosome, and reveal the mechanical force’s role in this
movement. The outcome of this proposal is to prove the hypothesis of ribosome’s “inchworm-like” translocation
model that was proposed during the first supporting period. It will fill the current knowledge gap regarding
mechanical force’s role in translocation fidelity, reveal new therapeutic targets for related diseases, and generate
a new tool for biophysical research. Our research is unique because force in ribosome translation is only recently
confirmed and its mechanistic role is largely unknown. To our best knowledge, FIRMS and SURFS are the only
approaches that can probe both force and movement of ribosome. The aims are: 1) reveal the relationship
among power stroke, frameshifting, and kinetics using disease-causing mutations in elongation factors. EF-G
and EF-Tu’s mutations at the GTP binding pocket and EF-G’s domain IV loops interacting with tRNA are the
subjects. 2) investigate the roles of mRNA modifications, codon repeats, and antibiotics in translocation. Among
the 27 mRNA residues covered inside the ribosome, specific locations interact with the rRNAs to serve as the
brakes for reading frame maintenance. Modifications and antibiotic bindings at these locations are the focus in
this aim. In addition, how G-quadruplexes of repeating mRNA sequences induce frameshifting and alter the
kinetics will be revealed. 3) develop multiplex time-resolved SURFS. During the previous funding period, we
developed force-induced remnant magnetization spectroscopy (FIRMS) to resolve different reading frames and
determine the power strokes of EF-G and its modifications. Toward the end of the first funding period, SURFS
technique was developed that integrated acoustic radiation force with FIRMS to achieve five-fold better force
resolution. In this aim, SURFS will enable automatic multiplexed measurement with time-resolution. Therefore,
we will advance this technique with more efficient and precise measurements for force and translocation steps."

We hypothesize that oral fungi potentiate pancreas carcinogenesis via the pancreas tumor immune
microenvironment. The human oral cavity hosts a diverse microbiota, including bacteria and fungi. Our team has
made novel findings that human oral bacterial microbiome is related to risk of pancreas cancer development. In
this proposal, we focus on oral fungi (the mycobiome), a “keystone” component of the oral microbiome with the
highest biomass. Clinical candidiasis and carriage of a rare candidiasis-related genetic disorder increase risk for
pancreas cancer. In our preliminary data, we made novel finding that specific oral fungi are associated with at
least 2-fold differentials in pancreatic cancer risk, and those fungi are found in pancreas tumor tissue. We recently
reported that fungi experimentally promote pancreas cancer and tumoral immune response in animals. Taken
together, these data strongly support our hypothesis.
Our ultimate goal is to identify specific oral fungal microbiota in the general population that may be managed to
prevent pancreatic cancer. Our specific aims are: 1) to test whether oral fungal microbiome is associated with
subsequent risk of pancreatic cancer in a nested case-control study and 2) to test the hypothesis that
metabolically active fungi in the pancreas influence tumor immunity. Strengths of this study include a large
prospective study design, with oral samples collected prior to cancer development, and state-of-the-art fungal
and immune phenotype assays that will accurately and comprehensively characterize fungal composition and
immune phenotypes. This is the first investigation of oral and pancreas fungal microbiome and pancreatic cancer
risk.
Pancreatic cancer is highly lethal and little is known about ways to detect and prevent this disease. We expect
to identify specific oral fungi associated with risk of pancreas cancer and to identify fungal—host pancreatic
tumor immune response. These outcomes will expand our current limited knowledge on the causes of pancreatic
cancer, will help to identify people at high risk for this disease, and may lead to microbial-based prophylactic
prevention for pancreatic cancer. Thus, findings may help to rapidly advance our ability to reduce the burden of
this highly fatal disease."

 Migrating cells use filopodia to interact with and efficiently move through their complex 3D environments.
Filopodia are slender actin-filled projections composed of a core of cross-linked, parallel actin bundles. They
are highly dynamic, vary in length and found in a wide variety of cell types such as neurons that use them for
gradient sensing and efficient directional migration or cancer cells that employ them for moving out from
tumors into neighboring tissue.
 The first steps of filopodia formation are poorly understood. Three conserved proteins are required for their
formation - a MyTH4-FERM myosin) and two regulators ofactin polymerization, VASP and Formin. How the
action of these three proteins is coordinated to initiate filopodia formation is unknown. The objective of this
proposal is to define the molecular mechanism of filopodia initiation with an emphasis on the role of a MF
myosin and its functional relationship to the actin polymerase VASP in this process. Recent work revealed that
activation and specific targeting of the MF myosin to the cortex requires the actin polymerization activity of the
regulator VASP. The versatile model system Dictyostelium will be used to define the mechanism of this
collaborative interaction. It will also be used to investigate how the myosin motor and actin regulator work
together to organize the fast-growing ends of actin filaments at the membrane to initiate polymerization. A
combination of in vivo, in vitro and in silico approaches will be employed to a) gain new insight into the
regulation and mechanism of filopodia initiation and filopodial function in vivo; b) characterize the MF myosin
motor and its interaction with the actin network in vitro; and c) build a predictive mathematical model of
filopodia initiation.
 The knowledge generated by this project will reveal how cells use a myosin-based motor to build specific
actin-based structures such as filopodia. Understanding how initiation occurs will also reveal how cells control
filopodia formation to undergo directed migration or invade into surrounding tissues."

Candidate. This K23 proposal will position Dr. Nelson to become an independent investigator with expertise in
developing and testing evidence-based interventions to improve patient and treatment-related outcomes for
patients with hematologic conditions. Dr. Nelson demonstrates promise as a clinical researcher (20 publications
and over 50 presentations), and with additional training and mentorship will contribute to national and
international efforts to reduce symptom burden and improve quality of life for patients with blood disorders.
Mentorship. The mentor team is comprised of internationally recognized investigators in behavioral
interventions, cancer care, and patient-reported outcomes (mentor: Joseph Greer, PhD), and transplant care
and supportive care interventions (co-mentor: Areej El-Jawahri, MD). A scientific advisory committee with
complementary expertise will provide guidance on: qualitative data methods (Lara Traeger, PhD); clinical
assessment and management of fatigue (Heather Jim, PhD); and biostatistics (Dustin Rabideau, PhD). Training
Plan. Dr. Nelson will achieve short-term goals through a coordinated research and training plan in (1) HCT
medical issues, (2) intervention development and qualitative data methods, and (3) randomized clinical trial
design, testing, and assessment. In addition to regular mentorship meetings and experiential training through
the research plan, Dr. Nelson will complete advanced coursework and didactic trainings, attend and present at
seminars and national conferences, and publish findings in peer-reviewed journals. Background. Hematopoietic
stem cell transplant (HCT) is a potentially curative treatment for patients with life-threatening blood disorders;
yet, as many as 64% of HCT recipients go on to experience profoundly debilitating fatigue up to six years post-
transplant. Fatigue persists despite routine medical intervention, and empirically-tested interventions have been
largely ineffective at managing post-transplant fatigue. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is an evidence-based
treatment for fatigue, with observed effect sizes for fatigue reduction that are often two to three times greater
than exercise interventions among chronically ill patients. Despite the pressing need, CBT for fatigue reduction
has not been investigated in the HCT setting. Research Strategy. To address this gap, the proposed study
employs a two-stage design to develop and test a videoconference, cognitive-behavioral intervention (Vitalize-
HCT) to reduce fatigue and improve quality of life among persistently fatigued HCT survivors at the
Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center. Stage I includes (1) intervention development with input from
the empirical literature, psychologists and oncology clinicians, and open-ended interviews with HCT recipients
(n=20) and clinicians (n=5), and (2) a pilot study to refine the intervention and evaluate its acceptability (n=6).
Stage II will entail conducting a randomized controlled trial (n=75) to assess the feasibility and preliminary
efficacy of the Vitalize-HCT for improving patient-reported fatigue and QOL outcomes compared to minimally
enhanced usual care. This K23 lays the groundwork for an R01 to assess efficacy in a full-scale trial."
10809674,"Abstract Cryptococcus is one of the most important HIV/AIDS-associated pathogens, causing >220,000
infections, >180,000 deaths, and >15% of all HIV/AIDS-related deaths annually. The ability of C. neoformans to
survive at mammalian body temperature and in the presence of other host stress conditions is essential for
virulence. We identified the protein phosphatase calcineurin as a major molecular determinant required for
Cryptococcus thermotolerance and virulence. In response to temperature stress, calcineurin is activated by Ca2+-
calmodulin and acts as a serine/threonine phosphatase. Calcineurin plays broad roles in cryptococcal virulence
and is necessary to survive heat, cation, alkaline, and cell wall stress. We have further demonstrated calcineurin
plays conserved roles in virulence of other human pathogenic fungi (Candida, Aspergillus, Mucor), and others
have shown calcineurin is critical for virulence of Leishmania, Plasmodium, and plant fungal pathogens.
However, calcineurin is conserved across eukaryotes, and calcineurin inhibitors are potent immunosuppressants
in humans and thus difficult to utilize as antifungal drugs. Studies are in progress developing less
immunosuppressive analogs as candidate therapies. Thus, calcineurin is a general, conserved virulence factor
in eukaryotic microbial pathogens that can be targeted for therapy, and elucidation of the roles and mechanisms
of calcineurin signaling cascades can identify fungal-specific targets and is of general importance.
 We have achieved several key advances elucidating calcineurin roles in Cryptococcus pathogenesis. We
discovered heat and other stresses induce calcineurin to re-localize from the cytoplasm to P-bodies/stress
granules, sites of mRNA post-transcriptional/translational control. Via phospho-proteomic studies, we identified
calcineurin targets including the transcription factor Crz1 and proteins that localize to P-bodies/stress granules
and mediate mRNA processing, stability, and translation. Additionally, we identified stress-response genes
regulated by calcineurin-Crz1, as well as mRNAs regulated by calcineurin but not Crz1 through RNA-seq
analysis. These findings support our hypothesis that calcineurin controls a bifurcated signaling cascade
promoting stress survival and pathogenesis. In one branch, calcineurin stimulates Crz1 nuclear localization
and gene expression promoting stress survival and virulence. In a second, less-studied branch, calcineurin
undergoes heat-induced re-localization to P-bodies/stress granules and acts on targets governing mRNA
processing, stability, and translation, promoting pathogenesis post-transcriptionally. We propose two aims to test
this hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will identify, validate, and characterize high temperature specific calcineurin
interactors as substrates and effectors via TurboID-proximity labelling and Crz1 ChIP-seq analysis. In Aim 2, we
will define the importance of calcineurin re-localization and action on P-body/stress granule targets that enable
Cryptococcus to surmount host stress and infect normal and immunocompromised hosts. These studies will
elucidate conserved stress-responsive virulence networks of eukaryotic pathogens as therapeutic targets."

 Diabetes has a tremendous impact on the health and well-being of affected individuals, as well as a
considerable overall societal burden. Pancreatic islet transplantation has the potential to cure diabetes, but one
of the main problems limiting the success of this treatment is an inadequate supply of islets. Islets from a single
donor are often insufficient to achieve insulin independence, and multiple infusions are often required, each with
increasing risk. Two potential strategies exist to increase the number of islets available: (1) pool islets from
multiple donors and perform single procedure, high-dose transplants; and (2) develop alternative sources such
as stem-cell-derived islets. The availability of these limited resources becomes a supply chain problem, and for
either approach, a method for islet preservation is essential. Our long-term objective is to develop a method for
cryopreserving, or “banking,” islets prior to transplant. No previous strategy has achieved the high viability,
function, and clinical scalability required for transplant in a single approach.
 To achieve long-term islet banking, we propose to use an alternative cryopreservation strategy, vitrification.
That is, cryogenic storage in an ice-free glassy state. A significant challenge in the vitrification of biospecimens
is that the cooling and heating rates needed for vitrifying and rewarming are tremendously high (>107 °C/min).
These rates are reduced by adding cryoprotective agents (CPA) that inhibit ice formation, but these agents are
themselves toxic to islets. Thus, the critical challenge in islet vitrification is achieving fast enough cooling and
warming to avoid ice, while avoiding toxicity from the CPA, and doing so in a clinically scalable manner.
 Using engineering principles of heat and mass transfer, our multidisciplinary research team has developed
an approach for vitrification and rewarming (VR) to solve this problem, termed “cryomesh VR,” for islets. Our
central hypothesis is that the improved heat transfer achieved by cryomesh VR, combined with optimizations
in CPA use, will enable ice-free vitrification and rewarming of islets while avoiding toxicity. Our preliminary
data achieve cooling and warming rates far exceeding other methods, and we have shown CPA loading and
unloading protocols with low toxicity in mouse, human, pig, and human stem-cell-derived (SC) islets. Indeed, in
all cryopreserved islet models tested we have achieved viability, recovery, and function that meets or exceeds
all previous reports and does so in a clinically scalable method. To further improve our approach and move
towards clinical translation, we propose the following aims: Aim 1. Refine the optimal physical conditions for the
cryomesh VR of mouse, human, and SC islets; Aim 2. Measure the viability, function, and in vivo potency of
mouse, human, and SC islets following cryomesh VR; Aim 3. Define the molecular and cellular changes occurring
in response to cryopreservation; and Aim 4. Scale-up cryomesh VR for clinical throughput and adapt the
processes for cGMP production. If successful this approach could revolutionize how islets are isolated, allocated,
and stored prior to transplant and increase utilization of deceased donor pancreases for the cure of diabetes."

Early life respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) pulmonary infection can lead to the development of childhood wheeze
and asthma. This is an important area of concern as the overall incidence of asthma has been increasing. There
is a critical need to understand how early life events can predispose an individual for immunopathology later in
life such as asthma. Previous work in our laboratory using a neonatal murine model of RSV infection has
demonstrated that RSV infection can alter the early life gut microbiome. We have also shown that RSV infection
predisposes neonates for enhanced allergic disease in adulthood. However, the interplay between early life
infections and alterations in the microbiome is not well understood.
We hypothesize that a concurrent change in the microbiome with infection in early life leads to enhanced allergic
responses later in life through trained innate immunity of immune cell precursors. We will test this hypothesis by
assessing the respective factors in gnotobiotic experiments using both naïve and RSV-induced altered
microbiomes followed by allergic modeling with cockroach allergen (CRA) to establish the differential and
synergistic roles of the altered microbiome and RSV infection. Additional data collected since the initial
submission further supports our hypothesis showing that conventional murine microbiome transfer into germ-
free neonates reduces the airway hyperreactivity after allergen challenge when compared to germ-free neonates.
This does not occur when microbiome is transferred into germ-free adults suggesting that early life is a critical
window for protection possibly through epigenetic regulation of the immune system.
Additional preliminary data show that immune cell precursors such as bone marrow monocytes are epigenetically
altered following early life RSV infection with concurrent gut microbiome alteration further indicating trained
immunity. Monocytes seed the lung environment upon inflammation and can differentiate into various other cells
that reinforce inflammation within the lung during an allergic response. We plan to obtain a comprehensive
understanding of the trained innate immunity after RSV infection by performing ChIP-seq experiments for
activating and repressive histone modifications in bone marrow monocytes. This application has also been
revised since initial submission based on reviewer’s comments to better investigate the role of microbiome
alterations upon immune cell precursors by directly testing the impact of epigenetic alteration of monocytes
during allergic inflammation.
The results from these studies will further our understanding of how early life pulmonary infections and alterations
of the early life microbiome impacts trained innate immunity. This project will also serve as excellent training for
the applicant, Alexander Ethridge, to gain the research and critical thinking skills that will help him become a
successful, independent scientist."

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United
States despite representing only 2% of all cancer cases. PDAC is characterized by an extensive
fibroinflammatory stroma and a hypoxic microenvironment, which contributes to disease progression and
therapeutic resistance. Macrophages and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the predominant cell types
within the PDAC stroma. Macrophages are a major immunosuppressive population in PDAC. These cells are
highly plastic and, as a result, their environment plays an important role in regulating their function. Macrophages
adapt to hypoxia, a condition of low oxygen availability, primarily through the stabilization of oxygen-liable
transcription factors called hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). Although PDAC is extremely hypoxic and both the
tumor cells and stromal cells experience hypoxia, the effects of hypoxia and HIFs on macrophages and their
communication with other stromal cells in PDAC remain largely unknown. Our group has recently found that
hypoxia promotes the acquisition of inflammatory cancer-associated fibroblasts (inflammatory CAFs), a recently
defined PDAC fibroblast subtype that produces high levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. By
injecting a hypoxia probe into mice bearing PDAC, we have observed that inflammatory CAFs and macrophages
predominantly reside in hypoxic tumor regions compared with normoxic regions whereas T cells are largely
excluded from hypoxic tumor areas. Based on these preliminary data, I hypothesize that inflammatory fibroblasts
induced by hypoxia promote macrophage infiltration into hypoxic tumor regions and facilitate an
immunosuppressive macrophage phenotype. This hypothesis will be investigated with the following two Aims:
(1) to determine the role of hypoxia-induced fibroblast-secreted factors in regulating macrophage migration and
function in PDAC and (2) to define the role of macrophage HIFs in regulating macrophage migration and function
in PDAC. To complete Aim 1, I will culture macrophages with conditioned media derived from mono- and co-
cultures of pancreatic tumor cells and fibroblasts under either hypoxia or normoxia, and then assess the
expression of immunosuppressive macrophage markers as well as their migration. To complete Aim 2, I will
culture HIF1α-deficient and HIF2α-deficient macrophages under hypoxia with fresh media or conditioned media
from co-cultures of pancreatic tumor cells and fibroblasts under hypoxia. Then I will assess the expression of
immunosuppressive markers in these macrophages and evaluate their migration. Finally, I will define the role of
macrophage HIFs in mediating pancreatic tumorigenesis using orthotopic tumors from mice lacking myeloid
expression of HIF1ɑ or HIF2ɑ. My proposal will provide new insights into how hypoxia promotes an
immunosuppressive PDAC microenvironment by modulating the macrophage-fibroblast crosstalk, and ultimately
inform strategies to overcome resistance to immunotherapy."

 Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease in which the insulin-producing β-cells of the pancreas are
destroyed. T1D affects 3 million children and adults in the US with healthcare costs exceeding $15 billion.
Standard therapy with exogenous insulin is burdensome, associated with a significant danger of hypoglycemia,
and only partially efficacious in preventing long-term complications. Transplantation of allogeneic islets from
cadaveric donors in conjunction with chronic immunosuppression has been recently shown to be effective in
restoring euglycemia in clinical trials. However, the long-term future of cell replacement therapy for T1D requires
a reliable and replenishable β-cell source and elimination of the need for chronic immunosuppression. β-cells
derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC) represent a transformative, unlimited source of insulin-
producing cells for the treatment of T1D. However, the resulting cell population is heterogeneous and the
development of mature insulin-producing cells is inconsistent. Furthermore, significant barriers related to long-
term engraftment and function without chronic immunosuppression prevent the application of these promising
cells. The objective of this project is to engineer biomaterials that (i) promote maturation and function of human
pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived β-cells and (ii) protect them from rejection by the immune system without
the need for chronic immunosuppression. It is hypothesized that synthetic hydrogels with optimal biophysical
and biochemical characteristics will provide a material platform that directs hPSC-derived β-cell maturation,
engraftment and function without chronic immunosuppression. Aim 1: Engineer synthetic hydrogel formulations
that promote survival, maturation, and function of immature β-cells. Aim 2: Evaluate engineered hydrogels as
delivery carriers for β-cell transplantation in diabetic, immunocompromised mice. Aim 3: Engineer
immunomodulatory hydrogels to promote hPSC-derived β-cell immune-acceptance and function in diabetic,
immunocompetent humanized mice without chronic immunosuppression. This highly innovative novel strategy
is fundamentally different from ongoing work in the field in terms of (i) engineering materials that provide
microenvironmental cues to promote maturation of β-cells and local immune acceptance to eliminate the need
of chronic systemic immunosuppressive drugs, (ii) transplantation into a clinically-translatable extrahepatic site
with high vascularization and engraftment potential, and (iii) evaluation in humanized mice to provide proof-of-
efficacy as a prelude to clinical translation. This project will provide a significant foundation for translation of this
promising human cell source and will establish innovative materials that promote survival, engraftment, and
function of human stem cell-derived β-cells in immunocompetent diabetic hosts."

Advances in molecular understanding of the process of carcinogenesis have led to the study of an increasing
number of agents to intercept the early phases of cancer development, including the recent interest in
immunoprevention. The overall objective of University of Arizona Cancer Prevention Clinical Trials Network (UA
CP-CTNet) is to perform early phase clinical trials to evaluate the biologic effects of putative preventive agents
and to determine clinically relevant correlates in order to identify agents with good safety profiles and preliminary
efficacy for definitive Phase III trials.
The UA CP-CTNet consists of a team of physicians from diverse specialties, statisticians, clinical staff, data
managers, pathologists, translational scientists, and other personnel with extensive experience in early phase
clinical trials of cancer preventive agents and in translational research in various organ sites.
Specifically, the UA CP-CTNet will:
 • Efficiently design and conduct Phase 0/I/II clinical trials to assess the cancer preventive potential of
 repurposed drugs that affect multiple chronic diseases, well-characterized nutraceutical agents,
 regional/topical drug delivery, and immune modulators, identified from translational research,
 epidemiological studies, and/or clinical research.
 • Characterize the clinical activity and biological effects of putative cancer preventive agents on their
 defined molecular/biochemical targets, the immune surveillance network, surrogate endpoints associated
 with carcinogenesis, and other biological effect markers identified in preclinical studies.
 • Develop further scientific insights into the mechanisms of cancer prevention by the agents studied and
 to develop novel potential markers as determinants of response and for selecting subpopulations who
 may differentially benefit from the studied agent.
Through the proposed research, we expect to conduct rigorously designed early phase cancer prevention clinical
trials that determine the clinical activity and biological effects of potential preventive agents. The research
findings will further scientific insights into the mechanisms of cancer prevention and develop novel potential
biomarkers as determinants of response. Scientific and clinical evidence generated from these early phase
cancer prevention clinical trials will contribute significantly to “go-no go” decisions for further clinical development
of putative agents for cancer prevention."
10918261,"Abstract
Family health history (FHH), a critical component of genomic medicine that is essential for both identifying
individuals at risk for hereditary conditions and for contextualizing results of genetic testing, continues to be
broadly underutilized and underappreciated in clinical care. Barriers to adequate data collection and synthesis
are numerous and cross all clinical stakeholders: patients, providers, and health systems. Significantly, they
include the pervasive view that FHH is unimportant except in select cases and that it rarely contributes to
clinical decision making. With this perspective, few providers have been willing to allocate precious time to
collect detailed FHHs or to learn the complex algorithms required to synthesize FHH data into actionable care
plans. However, in studies of systematic FHH-based risk assessments in unselected populations, 25% of
patients meet risk criteria for (actionable) hereditary conditions. FHH-based risk assessment programs have
emerged to address these barriers, but as designed do not meet the needs of low literacy, low resource
populations. The goal of this proposal is to develop a scalable end-to-end solution for risk assessment and
management that meets the needs of low resource settings. Our central hypothesis is that combining FHH-
driven risk assessment, a literacy-enhanced interface, family engagement (through social networking platforms
for data gather and risk sharing), and a genetic testing delivery system, will create a solution that engages and
increases the proportion of diverse patients who are identified as at increased risk, who undergo testing, and,
when appropriate, who initiate cascade screening among relatives. In this proposal we will define and deploy
this new care delivery model as the “Genomic medicine Risk Assessment Care for Everyone” (GRACE).
To this end we will 1) develop and deploy the model using pre-implementation assessments at clinical sites
with highly diverse patient populations to select the most appropriate integration options and pathways for both
patients and providers; and 2) perform a randomized implementation-effectiveness pragmatic hybrid trial to
assess implementation and effectiveness outcomes relevant to these diverse populations. Outcomes will
include reach, uptake, clinical utility, accessibility, genetic testing frequency, genetic testing results, and cost-
effectiveness."

Finding novel therapies for treatment of radiation-induced toxicities is of value to not only patients who are
receiving radiotherapy for different conditions, but also to national security due to risk of terrorism attacks.
There is urgent need to develop therapies than can be administered quickly after exposure to minimize the
effects of radiation and enhance immune recovery. Preclinical models have informed a great deal of our
current clinical practice in managing acute radiation syndrome (ARS). These models can be used to test and
develop new cellular therapies. Choosing the proper cell subset, engineering it to produce the necessary
cytokines, and understanding how the cells interact with other hematopoietic and immune cells in vivo after
infusion are all critical factors in developing a proper cell-based therapy for ARS. Our group has previously
characterized an alternatively activated, high IL-6 producing human macrophage subset called mesenchymal
stem cell (MSC)-educated macrophages that can enhance survival from lethal ARS using a xenogeneic mouse
model as compared to infusions of MSCs or macrophages alone. We have simplified generation of these cells
by using exosomes from lipopolysaccharide-stimulated MSCs to educate monocytes into a radioprotective cell
subset. The long-term objectives of this proposal are to use MSC-exosomes to improve the generation and
efficacy of radioprotective cells and define their mechanism of radioprotection in preclinical models of ARS. We
will test the hypotheses that: (1) LPS-high exosome-educated monocytes (LPS-high EEMos) can mediate
radioprotection as an allogeneic cell therapy through production of IL-6; (2) LPS-high EEMos protect the host
from ARS by trafficking to radiosensitive organs, like bone marrow, and can be tracked by magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI); and (3) LPS-mimetics can be used to stimulate MSC exosome production that generate EEMos
through let-7b microRNA secretion. Success of any of the individual aims will be a major advance in
understanding how monocytes impact blood cell development after ARS. Translation of the entire proposal will
lead to an innovative, mechanistic understanding of a new cellular therapy for treating ARS."

 The primary objective of the Macromolecular and Cellular Structure Core is to provide cutting edge,
innovative platforms for structural characterization responsive to needs and discoveries of the U54 FTD Center
without Walls. The long-term goal of this FTD Center without Walls is to understand the overall metabolism of
tau, how it is stabilized by chaperones and cochaperones and how it is channeled for degradation by the
lysosome. This core will use the latest methodologies in cryoEM to determine atomic resolution cryoEM
structures of relevant proteins and protein complexes as defined in Projects 1, 2 and to provide a cellular
context for tau lysosomal degradation via cryoEM-Tomography. The high-resolution studies will be enabled via
the expression and in vitro reconstitution of critical protein-protein complexes and novel cryoEM grid
technologies developed by the Agard lab. Additionally, the core will use its biochemical expertise to quantify
the existence of tau seeds for the other parts of the Center via RTQuiC assays. Together, the contributions
from this Core will be significant as they will reveal fundamental mechanisms dictating tau turnover and provide
novel targets for potential therapeutic intervention."

Alcohol use, common among PLWH, plays an increasingly important role in the risk for and management of
HIV-associated comorbidities. Unhealthy drinking can exacerbate two highly prevalent HIV-related
comorbidities/co-occurring conditions, chronic pain and physical inactivity, which in turn, can intensify alcohol
use and affect physical and mental function in PLWH. We propose the Boston Alcohol Research
Collaboration on HIV/AIDS – Comorbidity Center (Boston ARCH CC) as an extension of our Boston
Alcohol Research Collaboration on HIV/AIDS (ARCH) cohort launched in 2011 and renewed in 2016 with
funding from NIAAA. In Boston ARCH CC we target in randomized trials these two modifiable conditions, pain
and physical inactivity, that have a critical impact on a variety of other HIV-related comorbidities. We will also
support secondary analyses of the existing Boston ARCH cohort, and provide support and mentoring to
trainees and investigators accessing the cohort. The Administrative Core will be responsible for the day-to-day
management of the Boston ARCH CC and the operation of its components. In addition to the Administrative
Core, Boston ARCH CC elements include two Research Project Components (clinical trials), and a
Biostatistics and Data Management Core that leads our secondary analysis and training missions. The specific
aims of the Administrative Core are to: 1) Provide a rich research environment for Boston ARCH CC
investigators and trainees, and assure efficient progress of high-quality alcohol and HIV comorbidity/co-
occurring condition science; 2) Centralize support for Research Project Component clinical trial implementation
(e.g. Data Safety Monitoring, digital clinical trial recruitment and enrollment, ecological momentary
assessments, alcohol biomarker tests), beyond what would be achievable by individual stand-alone projects; 3)
Facilitate secondary data analysis, data sharing, and publication from analyses of Boston ARCH cohort data
related to pain, physical inactivity, and physical and mental health function; 4) Offer resources and mentoring
for early career investigators interested in engaging in alcohol and HIV research; 5) Engage in collaborative
science within and beyond the Boston ARCH CC. The Administrative Core, with its scientific and
administrative leadership and coordinated activities, will be essential for assuring that Boston ARCH CC
achieves its goals to reduce alcohol and HIV-associated comorbidities."

This SBIR Phase IIb proposal builds on the success of our Fast-track award supporting the pre-clinical
development of FAPXIL, an oral sustained-release micro-particulate formulation of Interleukin-10 for the
treatment of Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP). The Phase I portion of our Fast-track project provided
validation of our large-batch methods and activity in a clinically-relevant murine model of human FAP. The
Phase II segment further optimized the treatment protocol, defined the long-term therapeutic potential and
assessed potential effects of long-term treatment on local and systemic immune homeostasis. Additional Phase
II tasks included production of multiple scale-up batches for validation of batch-to-batch consistency, long-term
stability analysis, transfer of manufacturing methods to a CMO with GMP capability, and a Type C pre-IND
meeting with the FDA to inform future toxicology. Agency recommendations and responses to our interrogatives
form the Aims of this Phase IIb application to continue the development of FAPXIL® towards clinical trials in FAP
patients. To this end, Aim 1 will continue pharmaceutical quality and development activities; Aim 2 will establish
safety, tolerability and pK of FAPXIL in non-human primates; Aim 3 will complete a Type B pre-IND meeting with
the US FDA; Aim 4 will assess Investigational New Drug (IND) readiness and submit an orphan-drug designation
request for FAPXIL. The Aims proposed above will enable Therapyx, Inc. to continue pre-clinical work required
to obtain IND approval for this first-in-class oral biologic. Subsequent production of clinical grade drug product
and IND submission will be supported via NIH's SBIR Commercialization Readiness Program and Company
funds."

Meiosis is a specialized set of cell divisions that produce haploid gametes. During meiosis I (MI) in females,
bipolar spindle formation and positioning within the oocyte must be regulated tightly to ensure faithful
chromosome segregation and proper genome inheritance. In somatic mitotic cells, bipolar spindle formation
and positioning rely on a centrosome pair, each of which contains two centrioles. Interestingly, meiotic oocytes
lack centrioles and, hence, lack classic centrosomes. Meiotic oocytes, instead, contain numerous microtubule
(MT) organizing centers (MTOCs) that are organized, by largely unknown mechanisms, to establish two
spindle poles (polar MTOCs). The traditional view was that, in mammalian oocytes, MTs (and their associated
proteins) are the only cytoskeletal components responsible for organizing such MTOC spindles. However,
recent data suggest that F-actin is also involved in spindle bipolarity regulation. How F-actin interacts with MTs
to regulate polar MTOC organization during MI represents a critical gap in our understanding of how the
meiotic spindle is built. We recently identified a novel, functionally different, class of MTOCs (mcMTOCs) and
found that spindle maintenance at the oocyte center is regulated by two opposing forces (mcMTOC-mediated
MTs vs. F-actin). We also recently observed that ~50% of spindles are not assembled centrally. To date, such
peripheral spindle assembly was unobservable owing to technical limitations associated with spindle
fluorescence (i.e. live imaging). To circumvent this, we generated a Cep192-eGfp reporter mouse model
enabling spindle tracking wherever it is assembled. Strikingly, peripheral spindle formation is typically followed
by spindle migration towards the center – a previously undocumented phenomenon. Understanding the
molecular mechanisms regulating this corrective developmental event represents a major gap in our
knowledge of meiotic spindle spatiotemporal regulation during MI. This proposal lays the foundations for our
long-term goal: To understand how two critical events during MI — bipolar spindle assembly and positioning —
are regulated, in the absence of centrioles, to ensure faithful chromosome segregation. To do so, we will utilize
state-of-the-art approaches, including transgenic mouse models, genetic constructs, laser ablation, and
cutting-edge imaging, to tackle three critical goals: (i) determine how F-actin interacts with MTs to organize
polar MTOCs during bipolar spindle building, (ii) establish the mechanism(s) by which the peripheral
acentriolar spindle migrates to the oocyte center, and (iii) determine whether differences in biochemical
compositions of mcMTOCs vs. polar MTOCs underlie their functional differences. Given that chromosome
segregation errors (very common during MI) lead to aneuploidy, the leading genetic cause of developmental
disorders and miscarriage, these studies have the potential to significantly advance our basic understanding of
two fundamental processes — spindle formation and positioning — during MI whilst simultaneously shedding
light on why MI is notoriously error prone."

 Although invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) is a lifesaving treatment for about 300,000 U.S. patients with
acute respiratory failure each year, it is associated with significant risks. Spontaneous awakening and
breathing trials during IMV improve patient outcomes. Coordination of spontaneous awakening and breathing
trials (C-SAT/SBT) is complex and significant barriers to implementation exist and adherence with C-SAT/SBT
across institutions is highly variable. Although national guidelines recommend daily coordinated C-SAT/SBT in
IMV patients they are underused.
 Telehealth-enabled remote care is positioned to improve C-SAT/SBT use. At Intermountain Healthcare, we
have system-wide tele-critical care services staffed by critical care physicians, nurses, and respiratory
therapists who remotely monitor and assist with patients in ICUs using real-time audiovisual communication, a
systemwide electronic medical record (EMR), electronic dashboards, and clinical decision support. We
recently studied the impact of implementation strategies to improve evidence-based practices for lung
protective ventilation (LPV) in 3 pilot ICUs, and then adopted a Telehealth-Enabled, real-time Audit and
feedback for Clinician adHerence (“TEACH”) to disseminate LPV adherence strategies to the other 14 ICUs,
achieving over 90% adherence (NCT 03984175). This successful approach could help identify candidates for
C-SAT/SBT protocols, prompt bedside providers to perform C-SAT/SBT, and guide execution.
 The specific aims of this research are to (1) adapt baseline implementation strategies and to target C-
SAST/SBT using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research; (2) conduct a type II cluster-
randomized hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial to compare a usual audit and feedback implementation
approach to a usual audit and feedback implementation approach augmented with a Telehealth-Enabled, real-
time Audit and feedback for Clinician adHerence (“TEACH”) to promote C-SAT/SBT; and (3) evaluate
sustained adherence to the TEACH enhancement in the final year after the RCT has ended.
 Completion of this project will advance knowledge regarding the effective and sustainable strategies for C-
SAT/SBT implementation specifically and the effectiveness generally of telehealth remote monitoring and
prompting strategies to aid best practice implementation in ICUs. The proposed research builds on the study
team’s existing work and has potential to develop more informed and effective care of persons with respiratory
failure. Spread and scale of this telehealth-enabled, central monitoring of critical aspects of care for ICU
patients is particularly important to study now, given the vulnerability of ICU staff to COVID-19 exposure."

10724250,"Project Summary/Abstract:
The main focus of research in our group is to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms of pancreatic
and breast cancer pathogenesis. The overarching goal of our research is to investigate how the cellular pathways
(i.e. circuits) are dysregulated and can lead to uncontrolled cell growth (i.e. cancer). The ultimate goal is to
develop and use small molecules to target the dysregulated proteins that are the underlying cause of pancreatic
and breast cancers pathogenesis.
Our laboratory has been working with a group of proteins, called Mixed Lineage Kinases (MLKs). The roles of
MLKs in cancer is an emerging area and the inhibitor of this family has gone through clinical trial for Parkinson's
Disease. We have shown that inhibitor of MLKs can be repurposed to treat Triple Negative breast cancer (TNBC)
and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).
Our recent results (funded through VA-Merit) demonstrate that one of the MLK family member, MLK3 was highly
overexpressed in human pancreatic cancer tumors and was necessary for cell growth. Furthermore, using animal
models of pancreatic cancer, we have observed that MLKs inhibitor ameliorate PDAC and the animals survive
much longer, compared to vehicle treated animals. We plan to further explore how MLK3 dysregulation promotes
pancreatic cancer and ultimately use the inhibitors for therapeutic intervention.
The other two projects (funded through 2 NCI/NIH grants) are on breast cancer. We reported earlier that
suppression of MLK3 activity by Estrogen was necessary for ER+ breast cancer cell survival and growth. We
also observed that the other receptor, HER2 was also able to suppress MLK3 activity in HER2+ breast cancer
and this was also necessary for their survival. Taken together, these exciting results suggest that suppression
of MLK3 by ER and HER2 provides survival signals for breast cancer cell growth and proliferation. Therefore,
we developed a novel nanoparticle, loaded with MLK3 activator, ceramide (a lipid) that was able to induce
significant cell death in HER2+ and ER+ breast cancer cells. In animal models of ER+ and HER2+ breast cancer,
the ceramide-nanoparticle was able to reduce tumor burden. In addition, we also observed that in human TNBC
tumors, the activity of MLK3 was very high compared to ER+ breast cancer tumors. Through mechanistic studies,
we identified that MLK3 activity plays paradoxically a survival role in TNBC. Based on our cellular and human
tumor data, the animal transplanted with TNBC tumors (i.e. PDXs) were treated with MLKs inhibitors, indeed the
tumor burden was reduced and the animal life was prolonged. Our results are first in line to demonstrate that
MLK3/MLKs inhibitors can significantly reduce TNBC tumor burden and can prolog animals' life. Similarly,
following our cellular and human tumor data, the tumor burden of Herceptin (i.e. anti-HER2+ therapy) resistant
human tumors in animal (i.e. PDXs) was reduced.
Taken together, our results suggest conclusively that activator of MLK3/MLKs could be used to treat ER+ and
HER2+ breast cancer, whereas the inhibitor of MLK3/MLKs could serve as a therapeutic intervention for TNBC
and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Our comprehensive studies also suggest that it is utmost
important to understand the detail underlying molecular mechanisms of a disease before using any targeted
therapy."
10724251,"The major area of our research is to help understand the causes of, and development
treatments for neurodegenerative diseases and conditions, in particular Alzheimer’s
Disease (AD) and Multiple Sclerosis (MS). This work includes repurposing drugs that are
FDA-approved for other indications but we show can provide benefit in animal models of
AD and MS, making it easier to bring them to the clinic. A better understanding of how
these diseases start and evolve, and identification of interventions will help reduce
disease symptoms, as well as social and economic burdens. Our MS studies currently
funded by a Merit grant have expanded into the area of genetic risk factors that may
predispose one to developing MS, based on our findings of a novel nucleotide variant in
one particular gene. We are now determining how the variant increases risk using cell
cultures and a mouse model that we developed to replicate the human variant, and testing
drugs to see if they can minimize its effects. We are also testing if this variant, or others,
is present at higher frequency in certain veteran populations, including in African
American, Hispanic, and Caucasian cohorts. At the same time in work funded by the
National MS society, we are testing a novel compound in a mouse model of MS we
believe will reduce neuronal damage and also increase the myelin sheath that surrounds
and protections nerve cells.
We are also working on a project to evaluate the consequences of excessive alcohol
consumption on the development of AD. We found that exposing brain ‘support’ cells (glial
cells) to ethanol reduces their ability to clear amyloid plaques; we plan to extend those
cell studies to a mouse model of AD. We have also been funded to carry out studies that
may have particular importance to our active military as well as veteran population,
namely studies on possible neurological damage caused by commonly used anti-
coagulants (e.g.warfarin), and also more potent ‘superwarfarins’ that are used as
rodenticides, but unfortunately have also been used in military situations. We are
developing methods using FDA-approved drugs, we hope will prevent the toxic effects of
these drugs as well as long term consequences."
10724252,"The poor survival, high prevalence of smoking and alcohol use, and advanced stage at diagnosis of esophageal
squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in the VA population necessitates further study into new management
strategies for squamous cell carcinoma. Over the past few years, emerging immunotherapy approaches, such
as adoptive cell transfer, have highlighted the importance of understanding and manipulating the tumor
microenvironment. The tumor microenvironment in ESCC is understudied. In this proposal, we focus on
determining the role of eosinophils, a key component of the microenvironment, in ESCC. We have generated
preliminary data demonstrating the presence of eosinophils in human ESCC tumors but not in tumor-adjacent
tissue. We then established and characterized the 4-nitroquinolone-1-oxide (4-NQO) murine model of as a
feasible model for determining the function of eosinophils in the tumor microenvironment. We show that, in the
4-NQO model, eosinophils are constantly being produced by the bone marrow, recruited specifically to areas of
esophageal dysplasia as in human ESCC, and not present in areas without dysplasia. Additionally, Eotaxin-1
(CCL11), a potent eosinophil chemoattractant, is induced in areas of dysplasia. These observations suggest that
eosinophils play a tumor specific role and are not the result of a more general inflammatory response. While the
4-NQO model will be employed to generate a broader understanding of eosinophils’ role in tumorigenesis,
sophisticated co-culture techniques the we have developed provide mechanistic insights into eosinophil
activation and function in tumor biology. In this proposal we show that eosinophils co-cultured with esophageal
cells increases apoptosis, decreases viability, and alters the cytokine profile of epithelial cells, increasing
expression of TNF-a and IL-2, IL-8, and IL-10. Furthermore, eosinophils, which produce reactive oxygen species
(ROS), have increased expression of eosinophil peroxidase after co-culture with epithelial cells. This is significant
as eosinophil peroxidase is known to catalyze the oxidation of halides and thiocyanate, resulting in the release
of cytotoxic reactive oxidant species. Taken together, these data suggest that eosinophils may decrease viability
ESCC cells via release of ROS. Glutathione Peroxidase 1 (Gpx1), an abundant antioxidant enzyme expressed
by eosinophils, catalyzes the reduction of hydrogen peroxide or lipid peroxidases to water. Here we
independently propose that Gpx1 regulates ROS production by eosinophils, and the decrease in expression of
Gpx1 by eosinophils after co-culture with esophageal epithelial cells suggests it is modified by the eosinophil-
epithelial interaction. In light of these data and the recruitment of eosinophils specifically to areas of dysplasia
and carcinoma in ESCC, our overarching hypothesis is that eosinophils are cytotoxic to tumor cells and
thus are protective in ESCC. The specific aims for this project are: 1. To determine the role of eosinophils
in ESCC tumorigenesis. We will utilize the 4-NQO model of ESCC and compare esophageal tumorigenesis in
Ccl11-/- versus WT mice after treatment with 4-NQO. We will then determine the impact of eosinophil depletion
and hyper-eosinophilia on WT mice treated with 4-NQO at different time points. 2. To define the effect of
eosinophils on epithelial signaling and homeostasis. We will determine the effect of eosinophils on normal
and dysplastic epithelium by co-culturing eosinophils with mouse organoids. More specifically, we will define the
role of Gpx1 on eosinophil function and activation by co-culturing Gpx1-/- eosinophils with both wild-type
organoids and tumoroids. These studies have the potential to improve understanding of eosinophil biology within
the context of ESCC, which could lead to specific therapeutic interventions targeting eosinophil function."

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of hospitalizations and inpatient morbidity and
mortality in the United States. However, the etiological diagnosis of CAP is challenging as >75% of cultures are
negative and a causative pathogen cannot be identified. The ATS/IDSA guidelines recommend that extended
spectrum empiric antimicrobial therapy be limited to adult patients with risk factors for resistant pathogens.
However, in the face of negative cultures and diagnostic uncertainty, clinicians are often uncomfortable de-
escalating therapy, because narrowing treatment could result in inadequate coverage. The prolongation of
empiric treatment hampers antimicrobial stewardship efforts and encourages the development of antimicrobial
resistance. Our overall goal is to improve antimicrobial prescribing for patients with CAP by emphasizing
pathogen-directed therapy. An accurate pathogenic diagnosis could contribute to antimicrobial stewardship in 2
ways: 1) by allowing for initial narrow-spectrum therapy and 2) by providing confidence when de-escalating
therapy following negative cultures. Rapid diagnostic assays have the potential to provide accurate results
within hours and thereby reduce the duration of exposure to extended spectrum empiric therapy. Multiple
observational studies have demonstrated that use of molecular diagnostic assays is associated with favorable
outcomes including a reduction in the total duration of antimicrobial use and length of stay in the hospital. The
most recent antimicrobial stewardship implementation guidelines recommend the use of rapid viral testing for
respiratory pathogens as a means to reduce the use of inappropriate antibiotics. However, these
recommendations are based on low quality evidence and it is unknown whether more widespread early
diagnostic testing could reduce the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and/or prompt initiation of antiviral
therapy. De-escalation following negative bacterial cultures is another antimicrobial stewardship target. While
most de-escalation follows identification of a susceptible pathogen, the ATS/IDSA guidelines also recommend
de-escalation at 48 hours if cultures are negative. However, these recommendations are also based on
observational studies. We propose a large, multicenter 2 X 2 factorial cluster randomized controlled trial to test
both approaches to reducing the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics in patients with CAP: a) routine use of rapid
diagnostic testing at the time of admission and b) pharmacist-led de-escalation after 48 hours for clinically
stable patients with negative cultures. Our study will be the largest randomized trial to determine the impact of
rapid diagnostic testing on antimicrobial stewardship and patient outcomes. Our randomized trial design will
allow us to establish causality and determine whether broad spectrum antibiotics can be safely de-escalated in
stable patients. Findings from our proposed trials will generate important new knowledge about pathogen
targeted therapy and antimicrobial de-escalation in patients with CAP. Specifically, knowledge gained from this
proposal will allow physicians to limit the use of broad-spectrum antimicrobials and initiate targeted therapy."

 The COVID-19 pandemic has posed an unprecedented threat to the health and well-being of Americans,
especially low-income and minority Americans and those in poor health or who lost jobs in the economic
downturn. The proposed project will examine the protective effect of access to affordable health insurance for
poor and low-income Americans in the setting of major health, economic, and social disruptions to their lives.
Access to affordable health insurance differs across states because only 35 states and the District of Columbia
have adopted the Medicaid expansion to all working-age adults with incomes below 138% of poverty permitted
under the Affordable Care Act. The proposed project has three Specific Aims:
 Aim 1. To assess the protective effects of the Medicaid expansion on insurance coverage for adults and
 children following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Aim 2. To assess the protective effects of the Medicaid expansion on access to and use of health care,
 health care expenditures, and financial stress following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Aim 3. To assess the protective effects of the Medicaid expansion on health outcomes, including physical
 and mental health, for adults and children following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 We will also assess how the protective effects differ for disadvantaged persons including poor and low-
income persons, African Americans and Hispanics, persons in poor health, and persons who lose their jobs.
 We will employ two complementary national surveys—the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and the
Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS)—in a phased analysis of data straddling the onset of the
pandemic. NHIS covers numerous outcomes, with especially detailed measures of financial stress, children's
mental health, and some health behaviors. MEPS has more detailed measures of adults' mental health and
health care use and expenditures, and its panel design enables us to use analytic methods that more
comprehensively control for subjects' characteristics. However, MEPS data are not available until later.
 We will use regression analysis to model the study outcomes as functions of individual characteristics;
baseline state characteristics; time-varying local area characteristics including pandemic severity, depth of the
economic downturn, state policies intended to slow spread of the pandemic, and adherence to social
distancing; and interactions between states' Medicaid expansion status and local area characteristics. Our
approach will enable us to quantify the protective effects of the Medicaid expansion on the study outcomes and
assess the main pathways through which these effects occur. The proposed project will assess the value of
access to affordable health insurance for poor and low-income persons during the COVID-19 pandemic, but its
lessons will be generalizable to other recessions and public health crises, natural and man-made disasters,
and people who experience health or economic setbacks in normal times."
10906839,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Despite efforts to achieve UNAIDS 95-95-95 targets, marked deficits remain in antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence
and viral suppression among persons living with HIV (PLWH). Gaps in HIV treatment success are particularly
pronounced in racial and ethnic minority populations and particularly among Latinos in the Northeast United States (US)
and the Caribbean. Progression of HIV disease and premature deaths among PLWH have been attributed foremost to
insufficient engagement in medical care and adherence to HIV treatment regimens. Timely access to ART and subsequent
sustained ART adherence are central to therapeutic success and critical determinants of long-term health outcomes (e.g.,
viral suppression) in PLWH. To that end, our team conducted extensive formative work (CDC:U01PS003715) with
racial/ethnic minority PLWH and their providers to identify the content, features, functionalities, and interface of a mobile
app to improve health outcomes, including ART adherence. Building on the findings, the Agency for Healthcare Research
and Quality (AHRQ) provided support to build this app and integrate it with a smart pill box (CleverCap) enabling PLWH
to self-monitor their medication adherence in real-time. This innovative tool, the WiseApp, supersedes current approaches
to ART adherence using a self-management mobile app linked to an electronic pill box and is currently being evaluated in
a randomized controlled trial (RCT) (NCT03205982) in New York City (NYC). At the same time, there is a strong need
for the development and testing of self-management interventions for Spanish speaking Latino PLWH since they are the
largest and fastest growing ethnic minority group in the US and are disproportionately affected by HIV. We propose to
test the transferability of the WiseApp to Latinos in the US and the Dominican Republic (DR) by translating and
culturally adapting it and conducting a multi-site RCT to assess its efficacy. The proposed project is aligned with AHRQ
Special Emphasis Notice NOT-HS-16-015 and will use health information technology to facilitate the collection and use
of patient-reported outcomes including medication adherence, quality of life, and symptom burden. The study will address
the following specific aims: 1. Adapt and ensure the usability of the WiseApp for Spanish speaking PLWH. 2. Conduct a
RCT to assess the efficacy and sustainability of the WiseApp compared to a usual care control in a transnational sample
of Spanish speaking PLWH at 3, 6, and 12 months. 3. Identify multi-level barriers and facilitators to the widespread
implementation of the WiseApp. A mixed-methods, multi-stakeholder process evaluation of the WiseApp will be
conducted guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. The proposed project builds on our
team's robust preliminary data and capitalizes on the strong linkage between Columbia University and Clínica de Familia
in the DR. This project's significance is further enhanced by capitalizing on the strong presence of Latinos in the
Washington Heights neighborhood of NYC, the disproportionately high rates of HIV in the DR, and the patterns of
geographic mobility between NYC and the DR. Importantly, our study focuses on AHRQ Priority Populations,
specifically chronically ill, inner-city, low-income, and racial/ethnic minority persons."
10906680,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Heart failure, measured at the subcellular level, is the result of impaired cardiomyocyte excitation-contraction
(E-C) coupling. One key structural component of E–C coupling is the myocyte transverse (T)-tubule system. T-
tubules play an essential role in coordinating membrane excitation with muscle contraction by facilitating the
synchronized release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Our group, as well as those of others, have
provided strong evidence that failing myocytes from patients and animal models are characterized by a
degenerated and disorganized T-tubule system resulting in impaired intracellular Ca2+ dynamics and
myofilament contraction. The long-term goal of our research is to discern and take advantage of the
fundamental mechanisms underlying T-tubule remodeling processes in heart disease toward restoring T-tubule
integrity and slowing, if not reversing, heart failure progression. We have identified Mitsugumin 53
(MG53/TRIM72) as a potential T-tubule repair enzyme. We find MG53, known to be involved in injury-induced
membrane vesicle trafficking and repair in striated muscle, localizes to T-tubules and is upregulated in human
failing hearts and animal models of chronic heart failure. Our preliminary data indicate MG53 possesses
apparent divergent functions in the heart, MG53 deletion of MG53 exacerbates T-tubule degeneration in
stressed hearts while exogenous MG53 overexpression promotes progressive and severe T-tubule disruption.
Interestingly, we have mapped overexpression effects to its little-studied E3-ligase domain. It is our
hypothesis, therefore, that the membrane repair versus E3-ubiquitin ligase activities of MG53 determine
cardiomyocyte T-tubule integrity and E-C coupling function during health and in disease. We have recently
generated two novel knockin animals for separately examining endogenous MG53 E3-ligase and membrane
repair functions during cardiac stress responses. We will test our hypothesis by first determining the
physiological (Aim 1) and molecular (Aim 2) actions of the MG53 E3-ubiquitin ligase, as well as its membrane
repair (Aim 3), domains in T-tubule structure and Ca2+ handling at baseline and in response to cardiac stress.
We will attribute apparently discordant ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis and membrane healing functions of
MG53 to overall T-tubule integrity, E-C coupling and cardiac remodeling processes. Understanding the
mechanisms by which MG53 facilitates T-tubule remodeling versus repair will allow us design highly targeted
and efficacious therapeutics for heart failure treatment."

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) offers an advanced treatment option for conditions that are
otherwise incurable. Pulmonary complications are common following HSCT and severely compromise its
overall success rate. The most severe end of this spectrum is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),
which occurs in 5% of patients following HSCT, with a mortality >60%. As effective treatments for ARDS are
lacking, developing new ways to prevent ARDS is likely to be more successful in improving patient outcomes.
Two critical knowledge gaps make developing successful prevention strategies difficult: 1) an inability to
reliably identify high-risk patients before ARDS has developed and; 2) an incomplete understanding of the
mechanisms and subtypes of post-HSCT ARDS. The scientific objectives of this application are to address
these critical knowledge gaps through the following Specific Aims:
 1) Develop and validate a risk-prediction model incorporating pre-transplant, post-transplant and in-
 hospital risk factors that can help identify which patients are most likely to develop post-HSCT ARDS.
 2) Prospectively evaluate metabolomics in patients at high-risk of developing post-HSCT ARDS and utilize
 clinical, biomarker and metabolomics data to explore endophenotypes of post-HSCT ARDS.
Aim 1 leverages highly innovative data extraction techniques to develop a real-time continuous ARDS risk
surveillance system for patients who undergo HSCT. Aim 2 evaluates the role of metabolomics, an emerging
analytic tool, in advancing mechanistic understanding of why patients develop post-HSCT ARDS, as well as
whether recently described ARDS endophenotypes can be identified post-HSCT ARDS.
The applicant’s long-term goals are to: 1) become an independent translational clinician-scientist leading a
multidisciplinary research team focused on improving outcomes of patients who develop respiratory
complications after HSCT, and 2) develop effective strategies to prevent post-HSCT ARDS, one of the most
significant post-transplant complications today. The training goals of the applicant are to develop advanced
skills in statistics, biomedical modeling, machine learning, and metabolomics to facilitate these long-term goals.
To address these training needs, the applicant has constructed a comprehensive career development plan that
includes targeted didactic opportunities in the areas of training need above, with additional “hands-on”
experience in all of these areas. The mentorship team and research environment is uniquely well suited to the
applicant’s needs, combining expertise in critical care informatics and metabolomics at a high-volume
academic transplant center. The proposal supports the NIH mission by striving to improve outcomes of patients
who develop respiratory failure after transplantation, while training a junior investigator in the essential skills
necessary for his transition to research independence."

The covalent modification of prokaryotic cell envelope glycans, namely lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and
(lipo)teichoic acids, with discrete substituents such as sugars, amino acids, phosphates or acyl groups, is a
well-known strategy used by Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria to modulate their cell surface
properties, the way they interact with their environment, their resistance to biocides and host defenses, and
pathogenicity. Although evidence exists that Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) similarly decorates its major
cell envelope glycans, arabinogalactan (AG) and lipoarabinomannan (LAM), with various tailoring substituents,
little is known of their biological significance. The discovery by our laboratories of the biosynthetic machineries
responsible for the synthesis and transfer of these discrete motifs to AG and LAM, and the generation of the
first Mtb knock-out mutants deficient in their biosynthesis have opened the way to studies aimed at
understanding the function of these motifs in the physiology and immunopathogenesis of Mtb. We
hypothesize that Mtb has evolved to modify its cell-envelope glycans with a distinct array of
strategically placed substituents to promote its survival in the host environment. Accordingly, a
multidisciplinary team of investigators with complementary expertise in mycobacterial cell envelope genetics
and glycobiology, TB immunopathogenesis, and carbohydrate chemistry here proposes to investigate how
simple (amino/thio)sugars or other charged groups strategically placed within the Mtb cell envelope landscape
affect not only the physiology of this microorganism (Aim 1), but also the course of pulmonary infection,
pathology and development of innate and adaptive immunity in infected C3HeB/FeJ mice (Aim 2), and the
interactions of Mtb with host macrophages and dendritic cells thereby promoting survival within the host (Aim
3). Ultimately, these studies are expected to lead to significant new knowledge about the biological significance
of understudied aspects of the unique cell wall of mycobacteria."

No treatments are available to prevent Alzheimer’s disease, which currently affects 5.8 million Americans.
Alzheimer’s risk can be reduced through healthy diets, stress reduction and physical activity, yet maintaining
these can be difficult in practice due to cost and low motivation. Addressing these barriers, urban planning and
public health researchers have evidenced neighborhood characteristics that promote health by offering
amenities encouraging health behaviors such as walking. Greenspace (public and private areas with
vegetation) is one such neighborhood feature previously associated with reduced Alzheimer’s risk and slower
cognitive decline in the few published studies to date. Dr. Besser’s short-term research goal is to advance the
research on this topic, to assess if neighborhood greenspace is associated with brain aging in older adults. The
K01 specific aims are to determine if living in neighborhoods with greater vegetation and better access to parks
in early, mid, and late-life is associated with slower rates of cognitive decline and less brain atrophy in
cognitively normal older adults, and whether these associations vary by sex, race, apolipoprotein E genotype
(genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease), and geographic region. This longitudinal, observational study will
combine clinical and brain volume data from three Alzheimer’s Disease Centers, a mailed questionnaire, and
neighborhood greenspace measures derived using geographic information systems. Outcome variables will
include cognitive domain (episodic memory, language, attention, executive function) and brain volume
measures (hippocampal volume, white matter hyperintensities). Multi-level linear mixed models will account for
neighborhood clustering and control for confounders (e.g., demographics, neighborhood socioeconomic
status). The parallel career development plan involves: 1) learning to develop key neighborhood built
environment and brain aging measures; 2) advancing and developing specialized primary data collection skills;
3) gaining knowledge in the biology and epidemiology of aging and cognitive neuroscience; 4) preparing and
submitting the first R01 proposal; and 5) cultivating multidisciplinary collaborations. Dr. Besser’s institution,
Florida Atlantic University, offers a highly supportive environment with all of the necessary faculty, teaching,
financial, and research supports and rich opportunities for multidisciplinary and collaborative research. The
primary mentor and co-mentor are experts in their respective fields of neurology/aging research and urban and
regional planning. Dr. Besser’s institutional environment, career development plan, and specific aims are
ideally suited to enable her long-term goal to become an expert and independent research scientist with an
established, innovative, R01-funded research program focused on neighborhood built environments to support
healthy brain aging."

This proposal requests support for the next five Society of Ear, Nose and Throat Advances in Children
(SENTAC) annual scientific conferences, to enhance diversity, equity, and inclusion. The 51st SENTAC (2023;
1st year of support) will be held at the Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, the 1st weekend in
December. Location of the remaining four conferences will be known at least 18 months prior to conference.
SENTAC is a valuable conference in the field of pediatric otolaryngology, hearing, speech, language voice, and
swallowing. The annual multidisciplinary conference is composed of physicians and allied health care
professionals, including otolaryngologists, pediatricians, scientists, audiologists, speech therapists,
occupational therapists, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. The annual meeting is an ideal
opportunity for our community with trainees to present their multi- and trans-disciplinary research, participate in
teaching sessions, and experience expert panels. The overarching goal of this grant is to support annual
conferences for the next five years with a focus on enhancing diversity in membership and attendees and
support research presentations and educational sessions that focus on health inequities in the field of ear,
nose, and throat disorders in children. Specifically, we aim to: 1) Support the enhancement of diversity, equity,
and inclusion at the 51st, 52nd, 53rd, 54th, and 55th SENTAC conferences, by partnering with a Historically Black
College/University and/or Hispanic/Minority Servicing Institution in the regional location of the SENTAC
conference each year; 2) Promote and support the education and development of diverse trainee and early
career professionals by creating a culture that empowers student and early career professionals to be engaged
and participate in mentorship opportunities; 3) Organize special sessions on research for health disparities
within the medical and allied health science fields to address health disparities in the field of pediatric ear,
nose, and throat care at a national and global level, and 4) Organize special sessions led by diverse individuals
to increase the attendance and membership of diverse participants. NIH funds are requested to provide
registration fees for diverse/minority students and mentors from regional minority education programs, support
a diversity, equity, and inclusion award to an individual or group, travel for DEI keynote speaker and workshop
presenter, awards for selected early career research, and provide support for child/family care. A small amount
of funding for the MPI’s in the first 3 years (and decreased in the last 2 years) will provide the necessary time
to focus on the importance of the DEI efforts and establish the programs focused on DEI within SENTAC so
that all future meetings will automatically include this important framework."

We are requesting funds to support the Reproductive Aging Conference annually for 3 years, 2023 - 2025.
The 2023 meeting will be held at the Omni Rancho Las Palmas Resort (Palm Springs, California, USA) on May
2 - 5, 2023. This will be the second meeting following the Inaugural conference in June 2022. Aging in the
gonad dramatically affects aging in somatic tissues, yet we know little about the mechanisms regulating
healthy aging in reproductive organs, nor how this crosstalk is achieved. The Reproductive Aging conference
will focus on understanding mechanisms that regulate aging in reproductive tissues and their relationship to
overall organismal healthspan and longevity. Funds are requested each year to help cover expenses of 1)
invited speakers and 2) meritorious junior scientists (students, postdoctoral fellows and junior faculty) and
minority trainees who will benefit from formal and informal interactions with senior scientists, to present their
research findings, receive feedback from experts in the field, and exchange ideas for shaping the field. To our
knowledge, this is the only international meeting dedicated entirely to the topic of reproductive aging.
The goal of the Reproductive Aging conference is to showcase research and stimulate collaborations that
bridge the disciplines of reproductive biology and aging research to help define new paradigms to accelerate
progress. Our primary objective is to become the premier forum for coalescing the field and fostering the
discussion of concepts and presentation of research at the forefront of discovery related to aging in the
reproductive system and its connection to aging in the rest of the body. Reproductive aging research
encompasses multiple fronts of interest: identification of the molecular and cellular mechanisms that regulate
aging in reproductive organs that facilitate overall healthspan and longevity; mechanisms of germ cell and
niche aging and how these might regulate systemic aging; and developing new models to study these
interactions. The intersection of these historically separate areas, the basic biology of aging and aging in the
reproductive tract, have begun to merge around common molecular principles. Invited speakers include
established as well as outstanding early career scientists selected for the quality of their science and ability to
stimulate debate. This conference will provide a forum for both formal and informal interactions between
trainees and faculty at all stages to promote the exchange of ideas and collaborative synergies around
reproductive aging. Poster and oral presentations will examine reproductive aging at the molecular, cellular
and organismal level, including its molecular drivers, and the effects of genetic and environmental factors on
relevant cellular/system properties and interactions across diverse model systems ranging from worms to
humans. This unique conference will bring together scientists tackling this problem from fundamental to clinical
angles to brainstorm creative ways to build and strengthen the field."
10906078,"Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) are used as one of the diagnostic criteria for SLE, but they display poor
diagnostic specificity for SLE (~76%), as they are also detected in 20-40% of healthy individuals and are
frequently observed in other autoimmune diseases. Anti-DNA and anti-nucleosome antibodies have been
reported to fluctuate with renal flares in several studies but they have been sub-optimal in their diagnostic
potential. Anti-nucleosome and anti-chromatin antibodies appear earlier than anti-dsDNA Abs, about 4-8
years preceding diagnosis but it is not known if additional autoantibody specificities (with higher
sensitivity/specificity values) can be detected even earlier. Ab to post-translationally modified nucleosomes
in SLE have not been comprehensively studied, and their diagnostic significance remains poorly explored.
The repertoire of ANAs targeting epigenetic, PTM nucleosomal epitopes is currently a black box. Given
that activated cells, apoptotic cells, cells undergoing netosis all release PTM-nucleosomes (that may serve
as immunogens in SLE), it is imperative that we study Abs to epigenetically modified nucleosomes in SLE
comprehensively because these fine specificities are likely to have diagnostic significance as well as
relevance to disease pathogenesis. Importantly, a 3-dimensional, spectrally resolved, fluorescent bead-
based assay pioneered by our industrial partner relieves this bottleneck.
The central hypothesis of this proposal is that autoantibodies to histone/nucleosome PTMs could exhibit
superior diagnostic potential and pathogenic relevance in lupus. The goal of this academia-industry
partnership is to test this hypothesis using a novel, high-throughput, spectrally resolved, fluorescent bead-
based screening platform bearing a comprehensive battery of PTM-nucleosomes/histones and several
well-annotated SLE cohorts.
The availability of reliable serum biomarkers that can accurately diagnose SLE and renal involvement in
SLE can prompt earlier treatment, which has been shown to improve long-term outcome. The identified
sub-nucleosomal specificities may also shed light on the pathogenic origins of SLE."

 Changes in the legal landscape of cannabis have occurred simultaneously with increases in use among
adults. Research efforts have focused on examining consequences of use, however, characterizing the impact
of cannabis abstinence on health among regular cannabis users is also a relevant public health concern. Few
research studies have compared cognition or psychiatric disorder symptoms between abstinent cannabis users,
using contingency management (CM), to individuals in a control condition (monitoring), which does not require
changes in cannabis use. The current study aims to extend the findings to an older population, for a longer period
of cannabis abstinence, and to examine all cognitive domains. Thus, the first aim is to test the impact of cannabis
abstinence for 6 weeks (42 days) on memory, attention, processing speed, language, and executive function
(EFs) on adults, who are between 31 to 47 years old. The second aim is to explore how cannabis abstinence
effects psychiatric disorder symptoms. The third aim (exploratory) is to examine how genetic risk for various
psychiatric disorder symptoms by environment (cannabis abstinence versus continued use) interactions impact
cognition. The proposed study is novel in that we will use experimental manipulation to create discordance in
cannabis use among monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs. This research design will require significantly fewer resources
than large-scale randomized controlled trials because the use of MZ twin pairs requires a smaller sample size
and is still sufficiently powered to detect small effects. Fifty identical twin pairs (N=100), who are concordant on
cannabis use, will be recruited from the Colorado Twin Registry, which have all been genotyped. Each twin,
within a twin pair, will be randomly assigned to either CM, incentive-based protocol to promote abstinence, or
control, no changes in cannabis use requested, for 42 days. Participants will be assessed across 42 days on

proposed in this project could be used to understand other outcomes from cannabis abstinence (e.g., physical
health) or abstinence from other substances. The aims of the research project map on to the training goals: 1)

seminars, specific analytic projects, responsible conduct of research training and preparation and submission of
an R01 application in the final years. Completion of these research and training aims will provide me with the
necessary skills to conduct recovery studies and provide preliminary data for an R01 application."

the study of stress, trauma, and resilience."
10928180,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT 
COBRE Research Project 1 will enable Project Lead Vergara-Lopez to collect pilot data in support of a competitive R01 application investigating the influence of childhood maltreatment on repetitive negative thinking (RNT), and risk for mental health problems. Early life adversity alters cognitive processes; these effects become more evident as children transition to adolescence. However, the cognitive mechanisms by which childhood adversity confers risk for adolescent psychopathology are not well understood. We propose that cognitive control deficits, specifically poor set-shifting when processing emotional stimuli, leads to difficulty disengaging from negative content and experiences of repetitive negative thinking (RNT). RNT - a recurrent and difficult to control process focused on negative content has been proposed as a transdiagnostic cognitive risk factor across internalizing (e.g., depression, anxiety) and externalizing (e.g., substance use, aggression) problems. Yet, there are no studies that examine the role of RNT as it unfolds in vivo among adolescents with exposure to childhood adversity. This is a critical missed clinical opportunity because RNT may serve as a proximal malleable antecedent to a broad range of mental health problems, and thus, a potential transdiagnostic treatment target. Adolescents with comprehensive child protective services verified histories of maltreatment and other adversities (determined by contextual stress interviews, and self/parental report), will be recruited from a 12-year longitudinal study. We will capitalize on the infrastructure of this longitudinal study that has richly characterized maltreatment and other adverse exposures utilizing multi-method, multi-informant assessment of maltreatment in early childhood (ages 3-5) and middle childhood (ages 9-11) across exposure type, chronicity, and severity. We will recruit adolescents between 15-17 years old and a caregiver. Adolescents (N=75), and their caregivers will attend a laboratory visit to assess mental health via diagnostic clinical interviews and self-report measures. The adolescents will complete a cognitive control battery, a RNT induction paired with a free-view eye-tracking paradigm to assesses difficulty disengaging from negative content (i.e., how much participants visually dwell or perseverate on negative stimuli). Leveraging Ilumivu technology from the Technology, Assessment, Data, and Analysis (TADA) Core, adolescents will then complete a short-term EMA burst design with two, 2-week, EMA protocols at baseline and at a 6-month follow-up, assessing “real-time” RNT and cardinal mood symptoms of a broad spectrum of mental health problems (e.g., depressed, anxious, irritable, and angry mood). Finally, participants will complete a second laboratory visit to reassess full spectrum mental health via self-report and interviews. Ultimately, this research will inform the development of technology deployed ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) or just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) that vary based on real-time needs (e.g., in-vivo RNT) and help prevent and curtail mental health problems following childhood adversity."
10893618,"Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are common, disabling conditions. There is a growing awareness of important
sex differences in AUDs; for example, women experience more serious health complications from alcohol use
and also develop negative consequences from alcohol use more quickly. While the rate of AUDs is relatively
stable in men, the rate in women is escalating at an alarming rate. Neurobiological differences between sexes
are thought to underlie the differential impact of AUDs in men and women, but to date relatively few studies on
this topic exist. Animal models of addiction have substantially informed our understanding of the stages of
addiction— binge/intoxication, withdrawal/negative affect, and preoccupation/anticipation—and their underlying
pathophysiology. For example, chronic alcohol exposure causes neuroadaptive brain changes in an attempt to
maintain homeostasis. During the withdrawal/negative affect stage, hyperactive stress systems produce
symptoms including anxiety and depression which are thought to lead to relapse through negative
reinforcement. Women have higher rates of anxiety and stress-related disorders, which may contribute to sex
differences in early abstinence. Animal models of early abstinence from alcohol highlight the involvement the
bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). The BNST is also one of the most sexually dimorphic brain regions,
suggesting the BNST is involved in sex-related differences seen during early abstinence. We previously
published evidence for sex differences in BNST structural connectivity in humans. In addition, pilot data from
our NIAAA funded R21 provide initial evidence for sex differences: females had stronger structural and
functional connectivity within the BNST network, heightened stress responses, and higher anxiety during early
abstinence. The current study will focus on sex differences in the BNST network during early abstinence from
alcohol by investigating three specific aims: (1) Determine whether there are sex-related differences in BNST
intrinsic functional or structural connectivity during early abstinence; (2) Determine whether there are sex-
related differences in stress-related BNST function and BNST network connectivity during early abstinence; (3)
Investigate sex-related differences in the relationship between BNST function/connectivity, stress response,
and negative affect in early abstinence. Based on findings from animal models and our pilot data in humans,
we predict that during early abstinence, the BNST will show sex-specific differences in patterns of activity and
connectivity “at-rest” and in response to a mildly stressful task. We expect women will show stronger structural
and functional connectivity within the BNST network, heightened stress responses, and higher anxiety during
early abstinence. The successful completion of this study will fill a critical knowledge gap, determining whether
men and women show neurobiological differences in BNST networks underlying negative affect during early
abstinence from alcohol. The results will provide foundational information to inform future studies investigating
mechanisms of relapse and can guide the development of sex-specific or personalized treatments for AUD."
10911227,"Proper integration and transportation of interoceptive signals from organs to the brain via the vagus nerve appear to be critical for psychological experiences ranging from a variety of feelings and emotions to motivations and adaptive behaviors. Individuals with psychological disorders, including depression and bipolar disorder experience changes in eating behavior in addition to low mood. It has been thought that loss or increase of appetite in individuals with psychological disorders and substance abuse disorders results from disruptions in central reward and interoceptive neurocircuits. This proposal will perform functional analysis using neural anatomical tracing combined with physiological and behavioral analysis of the vagal sensory neural circuit that senses and integrates interoceptive signals in the liver. 
Each vagal sensory neuron has a central brainstem terminal. A population of catecholaminergic cells in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) receives input from liver-projecting vagal afferent neurons. These catecholaminergic neurons control glucoprivic feeding. Additionally, a subset of inhibitory neurons in the NTS regulate hepatic glucose production via preganglionic parasympathetic neurons. A subgroup of liver-projecting vagal sensory neurons can respond to changes in blood glucose and transmit this information to the neurons in the NTS. Intriguingly, a population of orexigenic neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and a subgroup of appetite-suppressing neurons in the parabrachial nucleus receive synaptic inputs from catecholaminergic neurons in the NTS. These appetite-regulating neurons appear to project to the structures implicated in depression and emotion. Therefore, we propose that a liver-brain neural circuit is essential for ingestive behaviors and that this neural circuit also plays a vital role in brain functions, particularly psychological disorders, including depression and bipolar disorder.
Studies in Aim 1 will determine the molecular and cellular identity of liver-projecting vagal sensory neurons. Experiments in Aim 2 will examine the functional consequences of the loss-of-function of a liver-brain neural circuit. Our proposal will have the potential to provide novel information on how nutrient and hormonal vagal afferent signals from the liver act on the CNS to drive appetitive and consummatory aspects of motivated feeding and reward behavior."

More than 44,000 new cases of Kaposi sarcoma (KS) are reported globally each year, 84% of which occur in
Africa. This and other Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV)-induced malignancies predominate in
people with acquired or iatrogenic immunodeficiencies. Although KSHV can be detected in other human body
fluids, its frequent detection in saliva in groups both with and without risk of sexually transmitted infections (e.g.,
children) suggests that the oral cavity is the site of primary acquisition. However, the mechanism of KSHV oral
transmission in vivo, particularly the critical viral envelope glycoproteins (gps) required for viral entry,
remains unresolved. Several KSHV–host interactions have been identified, but all prior experiments were
performed in vitro and have not been validated in vivo due to prior lack of an appropriate animal model. Through
collaboration with the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center, our laboratory has access to the common
marmoset (Callithrix jacchus, CJ), a recently developed KSHV non-human primate model that is susceptible to
KSHV oral infection, and under immunosuppression acquires KS-like skin lesions. The objective of this
application is to elucidate the minimum gps required to initiate primary oral infection in vivo, as a prerequisite to
selecting key gps for developing an effective prophylactic vaccine candidate. This application builds on Dr.
Ogembo’s recently completed NCI K01 CA184388-05 research on KSHV entry mechanisms and vaccine
development. Recently, we showed that in vitro, the KSHV glycoprotein gH/gL is essential for viral infection of
epithelial, endothelial, and fibroblasts cells, but not B cells. Notably, we and others have also shown that both
monoclonal and polyclonal Abs to KSHV glycoproteins gB, gH/gL, and gpK8.1, can neutralize KSHV infection of
diverse permissive human cells in vitro. Building on this success, we generated KSHV deletion mutants lacking
the four glycoproteins thought to be critical for viral entry (gB, gH/gL, gpK8.1) and various monoclonal antibodies
specific to these gps. In this project, we will use human ex vivo samples and the CJ KSHV model to test the
hypothesis that gB and gH/gL are critical for KSHV in vivo oral transmission. The premise of our proposal is
built on strong evidence that 1) KSHV can infect CJ, which develop KS-like skin lesions, and 2) Abs against the
KSHV glycoproteins gB and gH/gL can neutralize KSHV infection in vitro and ex vivo. Furthermore, the
permissiveness to KSHV infection of human cells ex vivo and CJ makes these platforms ideal to test the KSHV
gp requirements for infection. Successful completion of the proposed study will elucidate the minimum KSHV
gps required for primary infection in ex vivo and in vivo models, advancing our long-term goal of defining the
initial steps in KSHV infection of humans and the role of antibodies in protecting against the early steps of KSHV
transmission. This will ultimately inform design and development of prophylactic vaccines that can prevent KSHV
infection and its associated cancers."
10911861,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Recent years have witnessed an appreciation of the role that metabolic adaptation plays in conferring survival
advantages to cells that encounter the harsh nutrient-poor conditions of the tumor microenvironment. Of
particular relevance to this proposal is the now widely accepted notion that macropinocytosis, an endocytic
mechanism of fluid-phase uptake, functions in tumors as an amino acid supply route. By stimulating the uptake
of extracellular protein and targeting it for lysosomal degradation, macropinocytosis provides cells with a
source of protein-derived amino acids, allowing tumors to circumvent amino acid depletion and survive nutrient
stress. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumors are deficient in glutamine, a vital nutrient that
supports tumor growth. Our published work in PDAC cells has established that glutamine depletion has the
capacity to modulate macropinocytosis – dialing the process up or down as required. Interestingly, our
preliminary data presented in this proposal demonstrate for the first time that glutamine scarcity can also
stimulate macropinocytosis in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Mechanistically, we have attributed
glutamine stress-induced macropinocytic uptake in CAFs to a CAMKK2-AMPK signal that leads to the Rac1-
dependent actin cytoskeleton dynamics that are required for macropinocytosis. AMPK is a bioenergetic stress
sensor that is most often studied in the context of glucose starvation, which unlike glutamine depletion, does
not boost CAF macropinocytosis. Notably, not much is known about AMPK activation and function during
glutamine depletion. Our preliminary studies suggest that macropinocytosis has a dual purpose in CAFs – it
can serve to sustain CAF viability and function, and it can provide secreted amino acids to nourish the tumor
cells. Importantly, our in vivo and in vitro examinations of macropinocytosis in normal fibroblasts, as well as in
CAFs originating from other tumor types, suggest that glutamine depletion-induced stromal uptake is unique to
pancreatic CAFs. Based on these data, our central hypothesis is that glutamine scarcity selectively drives
CAMKK2-AMPK-dependent macropinocytosis in CAFs, and that stromal macropinocytosis is a process that
can be harnessed in PDAC therapy. In this proposal, we will 1) examine the molecular mechanisms driving the
selective role of glutamine in CAF macropinocytosis, 2) functionally characterize stromal macropinocytosis in
PDAC, and 3) determine whether the stromal reorganization that occurs with macropinocytosis inhibition can
be leveraged for PDAC therapy. This project will be of great significance, novelty and impact, as it will
constitute the first evaluation of the role of macropinocytosis in the PDAC tumor stroma and the first analysis to
selectively link glutamine starvation to CAMKK2-AMPK signaling. Moreover, because macropinocytosis is
important in both the tumor cells and the stroma, our work could have tremendous impact on the development
of novel therapeutic modalities for PDAC."

The proposed project concentrates on technology developments to enable high sensitivity, bias-tolerant spectral
CT for accurate quantitation of iodine concentration. Spectral CT has the potential of providing true quantitative
information of tissue composition and provides an avenue for combined functional and structural imaging. High-
sensitivity spectral CT accommodates anatomical sites that are traditionally hard to image, and reliable meas-
urements of iodine perfusion allow additional quantitative measures such as tissue texture to aid diagnosis and
clinical decision making. In the case of pancreatic cancer, the complex tumor microenvironment and the conse-
quential poor perfusion characteristics lead to difficulty in diagnosis, staging, and treatment assessment. The
need for visualizing low-enhancing lesions and the benefit of extracting quantitative information directly from
image data strongly motivate a high-sensitivity imaging modality for reproducible iodine measurements. The
need for visualizing low-enhancing lesions and the benefit of extracting quantitative information directly from
image data strongly motivate a high-sensitivity imaging modality for reproducible iodine measurements. How-
ever, state-of-the-art spectral CT presents large quantitation bias, i.e., inaccuracies in measured iodine concen-
tration compared to the truth. We identify three major sources that contribute to quantitation bias: imaging system
(e.g., spectrum mismatch), post-processing (e.g., biased estimator), and patient (scatter, beam hardening). The
bias effect in current spectral CT cannot be fully eliminated by increasing radiation exposure, and has complex
dependencies on the imaging system, imaging techniques, patient habitus, and processing algorithms. This in-
accuracy is a major impediment to pancreatic cancer management and quantitative applications in general. The
overall goal of this proposal is to develop robust, high-sensitivity spectral CT solutions that will enhance sensi-
tivity and reduce variability in iodine quantitation, which in turn enables accurate, high-performance spectral
biomarkers for disease management. The following specific aims will be pursued: (1) to develop an end-to-end,
modular theoretical model for robust spectral CT design and optimization, (2) to develop bias-tolerant processing
pipeline, and (3) to implement and evaluate high performance, hybrid spectral CT solutions on an experimental
CT bench. Completion of the proposed efforts enables robust, high sensitivity spectral CT for improved tumor
detection and characterization through accurate, high performance spectral biomarkers. Vendor- and spectral
technology-independent outcomes of the proposal include: optimized, patient-specific protocols; post-processing
pipelines that are robust against quantitative bias and variability; and the next generation spectral CT system
designs for enhanced iodine quantitation. Achievements from the proposed project will improve sensitivity and
quantitation accuracy of iodinated contrast media in spectral CT which enables quantitative diagnostics and
treatment assessment using robust iodine biomarkers across a broad range of clinical applications."

Since the Center for Interdisciplinary Research on AIDS (CIRA) was founded in 1997, it has supported a
diverse portfolio of interdisciplinary research in domestic and international settings, contributing to scientific
knowledge of HIV vulnerability and transmission and the cost-effectiveness and efficacy of HIV interventions in
highly impacted groups and settings. In the next 5 years, CIRA will focus on stimulating and supporting
innovative interdisciplinary research that combines behavioral, social, structural, and biomedical approaches to
improve HIV equity of status neutral HIV care (i.e., HIV prevention and treatment services across the care
continuum, regardless of one’s HIV status). We will leverage the extensive multi-disciplinary expertise of our
scientists and community partners to have substantial impact on the global epidemic through a focus on HIV
equity through the support of key research skills shown to improve equity: implementation science, community-
engaged research, HIV service integration, and digital health. As the sole AIDS Prevention Research Center in
New England, we will continue to focus on a regional response to HIV, by focusing on HIV prevention in small
urban areas in New England, while at the same time providing support to CIRA affiliates outside of New
England (mostly made up of former trainees from our successful training grants) who are in ending the
epidemic areas with limited resources and support. We will focus on drivers of the epidemic across the
ecological model (e.g., stigma, racism, forced displacement, neighborhood factors) and use the expertise of
CIRA scientists to address the intertwined issues of substance use, mental health, and HIV. Our global
research will also focus on promoting HIV equity in low resource settings, thus supporting UNAIDS 95-95-95
goals. We will also continue to invest in the training, mentoring, and development of the next generation of HIV
researchers and leaders, with a particular focus on the training and support of scientists from historically
marginalized populations. CIRA’s mission will be implemented through the coordinated effort of five cores:
Administrative; Development; Justice, Community, Capacity, and Equity; Clinical Health Services Research;
and Dissemination and Implementation Science Methods. Each Core will support and build capacity for HIV
equity research. We will embed Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) approaches into strategic planning and
evaluation processes to optimize Center efficiency and services. Core specific and center-wide impact will be
measured through systematic monitoring and evaluation."

 Consuming a healthy diet and maintaining a healthy weight provide significant protection against cancer
and cancer-related mortality. Early interventions are needed to decrease the risk of developing cancer later in
life. Early care and education (ECE) is a promising setting for cancer prevention.
 “Together, We Inspire Smart Eating” (WISE) is an intervention that improves children's diets in ECE. WISE
includes 4 key evidence-based practices (EBPs): (1) hands-on exposures to fruits and vegetables, (2) role
modeling by educators, (3) positive feeding practices, and (4) a mascot associated with fruits and vegetables.
Standard implementation approaches to WISE result in suboptimal implementation of WISE EBPs. Additional
implementation strategies are needed to increase adoption and fidelity to EBPs.
 To date, most studies have employed an “all-or-nothing” approach, comparing multifaceted strategies to
control groups without implementation support. Thus, there is an urgent need for optimized strategies that tailor
implementation support intensity to the unique challenges and limited resources of the ECE context. The
overall objectives of this application are to determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an adaptive
implementation approach to improve adoption of the EBPs of WISE while also examining implementation
mechanisms. Our central hypothesis is that the addition of high-intensity strategies at sites that do not respond
to low-intensity strategies will improve implementation and health outcomes.
 Specific Aim 1. Determine the effectiveness of an adaptive implementation strategy that tailors the
intensity of implementation support versus a low-intensity strategy. Using an enhanced non-responder
trial, we will compare the effect of continuing low-intensity strategies vs. augmenting with high-intensity
strategies. We hypothesize that sites receiving high-intensity strategies will outperform sites continuing the low-
intensity strategies on the primary outcome of intervention fidelity and on secondary child health outcomes.
 Specific Aim 2. Examine moderators and mediators of implementation outcomes in a mixed-
methods design. We will test organizational readiness and teacher experience as moderators of response to
the implementation strategies. We will test educators' perceptions of barriers, local implementation climate,
and implementation leadership as mediators of the effect of the strategies on implementation outcomes.
Qualitative data will explore other potential moderators and mediators not measured quantitatively.
 Specific Aim 3. Assess the incremental cost-effectiveness of the adaptive implementation strategy.
In this aim, we will estimate the cost per unit of fidelity associated with the adaptive implementation strategy.
Results will also determine the incremental cost-effectiveness of applying the adaptive strategy compared to
continuing low-intensity strategies for improving BMI and other child health outcomes."
10899641,"Abstract: The long-term objective of this application is to understand cortical processing of sensory to
motor transformations within the human cerebral cortex. A vast number of computations must be
performed to achieve sensory-guided motor control. Standing out among these computations, visual
information of the goals of action must be transformed from the coordinates of the retina to the
coordinates of effectors used for movement, for instance limb coordinates for reaching under visual
guidance and to world coordinates for interactions in the environment. Once an object is grasped,
somatosensory signals from the hand are required for dexterous manipulation of grasped objects. Internal
models within the sensory motor pathway are essential for estimating the current state of the body and the
external environment, accounting for lags in sensory feedback, and calibrating the body to the
environment.
We will use the rare opportunity of being able to record from populations of single neurons in a clinical
study designed to develop neural prosthetics for tetraplegic participants paralyzed by spinal cord injuries.
Cortical implants of microelectrode arrays will be made within three key locations in the sensorimotor
system: primary motor cortex, primary somatosensory cortex, and posterior parietal cortex. These
microelectrode arrays enable both recording and intracortical microstimulation.
We will test the hypothesis that somatosensory and motor cortex represent imagined reaches in hand
coordinates, but posterior parietal cortex is task dependent, and its population neural activity can flexibly
change coordinate frames to enable encoding of the spatial relations within the body (arm and eyes),
between the body and world (arm and reach targets; objects relative to self), and within the world (relative
position of objects in the world) as required by task demands. Percepts evoked by intracortical
microstimulation and imagined sensations will be used to understand the representation of cutaneous and
proprioceptive information within primary somatosensory cortex and posterior parietal cortex. The
hypothesis to be tested is that imagined sensation and electrically evoked sensations are highly
overlapping—not just in primary somatosensory cortex but also in posterior parietal cortex. Lastly, we
hypothesize that the posterior parietal cortex contains in humans an internal model of state estimation that
shows plasticity for both natural and brain-control behaviors and transfers this learning to motor cortex.
These studies will not only greatly advance our understanding of the human sensorimotor cortical circuit,
but also will provide basic knowledge for the design of future neural prosthetics."

Guidelines as an evidence-based, recommended PTSD treatment, there are limited data
supporting the use of WET with veterans suffering from PTSD. Additional research is needed to
support the use of WET for the treatment of veterans diagnosed with PTSD. The goal of this
study is to investigate whether WET is non-inferior in the treatment of PTSD in a sample of
veterans diagnosed with PTSD. Men and women veterans diagnosed with PTSD will be
randomly assigned to either WET (n = 75) or Prolonged Exposure (PE; n = 75). PTSD symptom
severity will serve as the primary outcome. Assessments will be conducted by independent
evaluators at baseline, 10-, 20-, and 20-week post first treatment session. WET is expected to
be non-inferior to PE in reducing PTSD symptom severity. In addition, WET is expected to have
significantly lower treatment dropout rate relative to the first five sessions of PE (i.e., better
treatment engagement). Moderators of treatment outcome for both treatment conditions will
also be investigated. If WET is found to be non-inferior to the more time intensive PE treatment
then the VA will have evidence to support the use of a brief PTSD treatment, which will assist in
addressing the high demand for PTSD clinical services."

conduct preclinical development and IND-enabling activities on our novel, orally available lead and backup
compounds that, in our preceding Phase II project, showed neuroprotection and beneficial effects on learning
and memory in a transgenic model of AD. Despite the enormity of AD as a national public health burden, the
therapeutic options are very limited. The few approved drugs treat only symptoms, and there are no disease-
modifying therapies available. All of the disease-modifying clinical trials have failed, with most drug targets
being amyloid or amyloid-related. With this patient population set to almost triple over the next 30 years, there
is an urgent need for disease-modifying therapies, specifically alternatives to amyloid-targeted drugs. Neuron
loss is the only physiological phenomena that has been directly linked to the cognition and memory loss in
patients, and a major cause of this brain cell loss in AD is endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced
apoptosis caused by aberrant intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis. Neurodon’s patented, small molecule activators
of the major ER Ca2+ handling protein, sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA), correct neuronal
calcium handling, rescue brain cells in vitro and in vivo, improve learning and memory in the APP/PS1 double
transgenic mouse model of AD, and reduce ER stress and apoptosis markers in vivo, enabling biomarker-
driven drug discovery and an improved probability of clinical success. Our Phase II research met the
milestones of nominating orally active lead and backup compounds that show efficacy in an animal model of
AD. Our goal of delivering an IND for AD will be accomplished by pursuing the following Aims: 1) Chemistry
scale-up, pre-formulation, ADME, and PK on our lead SERCA2b activator and 2 backup compounds. 2) To
assess the effects of SERCA2b activators on cognition and profiling AD mechanism-specific biomarkers in
vivo. 3) Perform necessary preclinical studies on a selected SERCA2b activator new chemical entity (NCE)
and backup compound in preparation for IND filing. The results of these Aims will be the generation of efficacy,
safety, and CMC information to complete a submission-ready FDA IND application for a new, disease-
modifying therapeutic for AD."
10898059,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Alcohol is the widely abused drug in the world, yet our understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which it
regulates brain function and behavior is rudimentary. Many of the molecules implicated in alcohol-induced
behaviors have broad roles in regulating diverse processes such as cell signaling, transcription, and neuronal
plasticity. The complexity of these processes has led to confusion about alcohol’s molecular underpinnings,
which has been further compounded by lack of the ability to manipulate gene expression with precise temporal
and spatial control within a well-defined neural circuit. The temporal and spatial specificity for manipulating gene
expression afforded in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, provides the ability to define where and when and
where alcohol is acting in the brain to influence both naive and learned behavior. Our unbiased forward genetics
approach in Drosophila has revealed the importance of the Notch signaling pathway in regulating formation of
memories of a sensory cue associated with the intoxicating properties of alcohol. Notch is a highly conserved
cell-signaling mechanism that involves cell-to-cell contact and initiates a transcriptional cascade important for
determining cell fate and function. Notch signaling also plays a key role in multiple forms of cancer and immune
disorders, as well as cardiovascular, kidney, liver, respiratory and neurodegenerative disease. We recently
demonstrated that rewarding doses of alcohol activate Notch signaling in memory-encoding neurons, and this
affects expression of novel Notch transcriptional targets such as dopamine receptors. What remains to be
understood are the mechanisms through which alcohol activates Notch, and how this ultimately affects dynamics
of memory circuits, both acutely and with chronic alcohol use. We hypothesize that Notch plays an important
role in activity-dependent transcription required for memory formation and thus ultimately shapes future reward
seeking. The goal of the proposed work is to use a genes-to-circuits-to-behavior approach to provide a causal
Notch-dependent mechanism through which alcohol-induced cellular activity can guide a transcriptional cascade
that influences future alcohol seeking. This increased molecular understanding of the lasting sensory memories
for intoxication will ultimately inform more effective targets for pharmacological treatment of alcohol use disorder."

The use of genotype directed precision therapies, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and
anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in EGFR mutant or ALK rearranged non-
small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), respectively, is associated with improvements in both response rate (RR) and
progression free survival (PFS) compared to chemotherapy. However, the PFS improvements are typically
only counted in months rather than years. Despite the development of next generation TKIs that can overcome
specific resistance mechanisms, it is very unlikely that any patient will be cured from their advanced lung
cancer using sequential single agent treatment. It is more than likely that significant improvements in patient
outcomes using precision therapies will only occur through the use of combination therapies. In the current
proposal we integrate pre-clinical in vitro and in vivo studies, with clinical trials and serial non-invasive analyses
of patient's tumors using cell free DNA to develop combination therapies. We focus primarily on EGFR mutant
lung cancer as this is the largest subset of NSCLC patients treated with precision therapies and as there is a
desperate need to developing more effective therapies for EGFR mutant patients. The approaches to
developing combination therapies include a.) dual targeting of EGFR, b.) vertical pathway inhibition (combining
EGFR inhibition with downstream signaling inhibition) and c.) parallel pathway inhibition (combining EGFR
inhibition with other signaling pathways). Our strategy will focus on improving therapies for EGFR inhibitor
naïve cancers, as such cancers are genetically the most homogeneous, and where improving treatment
approaches will likely translates into the greatest clinical benefit by delaying and/or preventing the emergence
of acquired drug resistance. Our preclinical studies provide the rationale for the combination clinical studies
and their success (or lack thereof) and toxicity in the clinic will inform about additional preclinical approaches to
further refine treatments. Through this iterative process, our goal is to make significant improvements in the
outcome of EGFR mutant and other lung cancer patients treated with genotyped directed therapies."

The overall goal of this research is to understand how stress disrupts the ovarian cycle. Chronic undernutrition
is a type of metabolic stress that impairs reproduction across species, and in women is implicated in the
development of functional hypothalamic amenorrhea, an anovulatory disorder resulting from inadequate
gonadotropin secretion. Although the tight coupling of energy balance to reproductive capacity is recognized in
principle, the neuroendocrine loci and molecular mechanisms that mediate ovarian cycle dysfunction
during undernutrition remain poorly understood. In females, ovulatory cyclicity is dependent on two
populations of kisspeptin (Kiss1) neurons within the hypothalamus that coordinate gonadotropin-releasing
hormone (GnRH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) pulses and generation of the preovulatory GnRH/LH surge.
Disruption of either arcuate Kiss1 (ARCKiss1) control of LH pulses or anteroventral periventricular Kiss1
(AVPVKiss1) control of the LH surge would be anticipated to impair ovarian cyclicity in females. Our preliminary
studies demonstrate that chronic undernutrition rapidly disrupts ovarian cyclicity in female mice via
impairment of both pulsatile LH secretion and the LH surge. We show that these inhibitory effects on the
ovarian cycle are recapitulated by activation of brainstem A2NE neurons or via central administration of urocortin
2 (UCN2), a neuropeptide that specifically activates corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 2 (CRHR2). Our
observations that antagonism of CRHR2 or knockdown of CRHR2 in Kiss1 cells diminishes reproductive
suppression in response to undernutrition or A2NE activation provide the foundation to test this neural pathway
mediating the effects of undernutrition on reproductive neuroendocrine function. Currently it is not known how
undernutrition disrupts the cycle or the neural processes controlling pulsatile or surge LH secretion. We propose
to fill this gap by testing the overall hypothesis: Chronic undernutrition disrupts the ovarian cycle and fertility
via activation of a NE – UCN2 – Kiss1 neural pathway that impairs two modes of LH secretion: LH pulses
and the preovulatory LH surge. Aim1 will utilize a genetic knockout approach to investigate the role of CRHR2
within Kiss1 cells as a mediator of disrupted cycles, LH pulses, and the LH surge during chronic undernutrition.
Aim 2.1 will utilize a chemogenic approach to test the sufficiency of this brainstem population to impair the ovarian
cycle, inhibit AVPVKiss1 control of the LH surge, and disrupt ARCKiss1 control of LH pulses. Aim 2.2 will determine
the necessity of A2NE signaling for disrupted ovarian cyclicity and impaired neural pathways underlying pulsatile
and surge LH secretion. This project will employ powerful physiological, anatomical, molecular and transgenic
tools to advance our knowledge of integrated stress responses and the regulation of gonadotropin secretion.
Results from this proposal will provide enhanced understanding of the metabolic control of reproduction that may
influence the management and treatment for anovulatory disorders resulting from negative energy balance. All
necessary animal models and methods are in place to complete these studies."

 A reservoir of latently infected cells persists in various anatomical sites in people living with HIV (PLWH),
despite effective virological control by antiretroviral therapy (ART). The majority of virally suppressed individuals
experience rapid viral rebound upon ART interruption, providing a strong rationale for the development of cure
strategies. Even in an ART-suppressed HIV infection, chronic inflammation and immune activation are observed,
along with limited CD4+T cell reconstitution, mucosal immune dysfunction, co-morbidities, and accelerated
ageing. Low-grade persistent transcription and trickling production of viral proteins from the pool of integrated
proviruses are believed to be partly responsible for these conditions. HIV eradication strategies such as shock-
and-kill have not been successful so far, and the pursuit of a functional cure or HIV remission has been thought
as an alternative worth exploring. A functional cure entails long-term, durable control of viral expression in the
absence of therapy, preventing disease progression and transmission, despite the presence of detectable
integrated proviruses. Our group has been at the forefront of developing one such strategy, labeled the block-
and-lock approach. The premise of this approach is that transcriptional inhibitors can mediate epigenetic
silencing of proviral expression, locking the virus in a profound state of latency from which reactivation is very
unlikely to occur upon ART discontinuation. We have demonstrated this principle using the small molecule
didehydro-Cortistatin A (dCA) inhibitor of Tat, the key regulator of HIV transcriptional amplification. In in vitro and
in humanized mouse models of HIV latency, dCA inhibition of HIV transcription over time drives the viral promoter
into deep transcriptional inhibition, limiting viral reactivation upon treatment interruption or with latency
reactivating agents (LRAs)1–8.
We believe that HIV transcriptional inhibitors, in general, have the potential to transform the way we treat HIV-
1 infections. Here we propose to investigate the potential of adding the transcriptional inhibitor dCA to an ART
regimen in the rhesus macaque (RhM) model of SHIV infection. Not only is dCA a new molecule that inhibits the
activity of a viral target not yet clinically explored, but it also opens the possibility for exploration of novel
approaches to fight HIV. Here we propose to: 1) determine the safety and pharmacokinetics of dCA in ART-
treated RhMs; 2) understand the relationship between dCA treatment and reduction in viral RNA in tissues, with
the time to viral rebound upon treatment interruption; and 3) study the impact of dCA as front-line therapy on the
size of the established viral reservoir."

Adoptive cell therapy using antigen receptor engineered T cells is a highly promising therapeutic approach, in
which cells are genetically modified to express an antigen receptor protein and are then adoptively transferred
into the patient. These cells then act as a “living drug” that can elicit potent therapeutic effects in response to
sensing a target antigen on a cell anywhere in the body. This approach is revolutionizing the treatment of blood
cancers and shows promise in cell therapies for treating solid tumors, auto-immune disease, and chronic viral
infection. We are developing highly modular universal adaptor versions of receptors, that we termed SNAP-CAR
and SNAP-synNotch. These receptors are “universal” as they can be chemically programmed to target any an-
tigen of interest by a co-administered adaptor molecule consisting of an antigen binding region conjugated to a
benzylguanine motif. Universal receptor systems can be used to target multiple antigens in a single patient or
across several disease indications by simply changing the antigen-targeting adaptor molecules.
Despite the tremendous promise of antigen receptor technologies, their implementation has been limited by
difficulties in attaining diseased cell-specificity through single antigen targeting, as well as unwanted on-tar-
get/off-disease toxicities and toxicities from overactive cells. We are addressing these technological gaps in
antigen receptor signaling-specificity by taking a chemical biology approach and combining chemical control of
biological systems through stimulus-reactive groups with receptor engineering.
The objective of this proposal is to develop universal antigen receptor systems that are conditionally activated
or deactivated by controller stimuli including small molecule exposure, as well as chemical changes characteristic
of diseased cellular microenvironments and antigen combinations. This will be achieved through completion of
the following aims: (1) Conditional control of universal antigen receptor signaling with OFF-switch adaptors. (2)
Conditional control of universal antigen receptor signaling using ON-switch adaptors. (3) Combinatorial control
of universal adaptor CAR T cells.
The underlying principle of our approach is a covalent bond formation between the adaptor and a self-labeling
SNAPtag enzyme fused to the receptor. Besides robust activation of cell signaling, the synthetic chemical linker
between the antibody and the receptor allows us to dial in a wide range of stimuli responses, including chemical
and biological triggers, based on distinct chemical designs of the linker molecules. Our characterization includes
demonstration in vitro using primary human T cells and in vivo in human cell xenograft mouse models.
Adoptive cell therapy with antigen receptor engineered cells is an active area of development and clinical use,
and the unprecedented level of conditional control enabled by the proposed systems will, as a long-term goal,
lead to improved patient outcomes through improved targeting and the ability to treat new disease indications."

ATAD3A (ATP family AAA-domain containing protein 3A) is a mitochondrial membrane protein that is implicated
in mitochondrial membrane dynamics. We discovered that dominant mutations in ATAD3A cause a human
neurological syndrome characterized by early-onset peripheral neuropathy, optic atrophy and mild brain
malformation. Patients with loss of function mutations in ATAD3A continue to be identified, presenting with
severe neurodevelopmental defects, supporting the importance of this protein in human health. However, the
root cause of this syndrome at the cellular and molecular levels, as well as strategies to ameliorate the symptoms
remain unsolved issues.
 Our long-term goal is to determine the roles of ATAD3A in development and in metabolic homeostasis
as the basis for therapies to treat patients suffering from ATAD3A-associated diseases. The objective of our
proposal is to uncover the mechanisms by which ATAD3A controls nutrition sensing (i.e. mTORC1), lysosomal
biogenesis and neuronal development using Drosophila and ATAD3A patient-derived induced pluripotent stem
cells. Our Central Hypothesis is that ATAD3A plays a key role in mTORC1 signaling and lysosomal biogenesis
through Rag GTPase modulation, and that ATAD3A-dependent nutrition sensing and lysosomal homeostasis
are required for proper neurogenesis and development based on the following compelling evidence. Briefly,
using IP-mass spec and co-IP, we identified endogenous binding partners of ATAD3A, including the lysosomal
proteins RagD, a GTPase required for activating mTORC1, and MiT-TFE proteins, transcriptional factors for
lysosomal biogenesis. We found that ATAD3A forms a complex with active Rag GTPases and MiT-TFE proteins.
This finding helped explain our discovery that Drosophila bearing a dominant negative ATAD3A mutation
(R528W) exhibit defects in nutrition sensing (implicating Rag/mTORC1), and aberrantly elevated lysosomal
content in developing neurons (implicating MITF). In Drosophila, we found that ATAD3A null mutations caused
embryonic lethality with abnormal patterning and morphology of central and peripheral neurons. In addition, we
found that the sizes of brain organoids derived from the patient iPSCs are significantly smaller than those derived
from isogenic controls. We will test our central hypothesis by performing the following Specific Aims: (1) to
determine how ATAD3A regulates mTORC1 signaling; (2) to determine how ATAD3A mutations lead to
abnormal lysosomal biogenesis in neurons; (3) to determine how ATAD3A loss causes neurogenesis defects.
 These studies will characterize a novel axis of mitochondria-lysosomal-mTORC1 signaling that should
reveal novel molecular insights into the cellular defects in patient neurons that underlie ATAD3A-associated
neurological diseases. We anticipate the identification of potential therapeutic targets for neurological diseases
associated not only with ATAD3A mutations, but also with defects in mitochondrial and lysosomal homeostasis."

 Mechanisms of inter-organ signaling have been established as hallmarks of nearly every
pathophysiologic condition, where many exist as related and complex diseases. While significant work has
been focused on understanding how individual cell types contribute and respond to specific perturbations
related to common, complex disease, an equally-important but relatively less-explored question involves how
relationships between organs are altered in the context of an integrated living organism. Current technical
advances, such as proteomic analysis of plasma or conditioned media, have allowed for a more unbiased
visualization and discovery of additional inter-tissue signaling molecules. However, one important feature
which is lacking from these approaches is the ability to gain insight as to the function, mechanisms of action
and target tissue(s) of relevant molecules. To begin to address these constraints, we initially developed a
correlation-based bioinformatics framework which uses multi-tissue gene expression and/or proteomic data, as
well as publicly available resources to statistically rank and functionally annotate endocrine proteins involved in
tissue cross-talk. Using this approach, we identified many known and experimentally validated several novel
inter-tissue circuits. This was this first study to directly link an endocrine-focused bioinformatics pipeline from
population data directly to experimentally-validated mechanisms of inter-tissue communication. While these
validations provide strong support for exploiting natural variation to discover new modes of communication,
these serve as simple proof-of-principle studies and, thus has promising potential for expansion. As a result,
we have developed a series of in silico tools to guide discovery of endocrine interactions. Specifically,
pathway-targeted enrichments, Bayesian network interrogation and scalable machine learning. The goal of
this proposal is to closely bridge these computational tools with experimental methods to systematically dissect
mechanisms by which tissues communicate and how these interactions are perturbed in metabolic disease
settings. Given that we survey genetic variation to guide prediction of new modes of endocrine
communication, these findings are likely to be robust across diverse backgrounds. We will implement high-
throughput screening of specific tissue communication circuits which operate under disease-specific conditions
of metabolism (ex. Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes), define which are conserved from mice to humans and
mechanistically dissect pathophysiologic impacts of endocrine communication through in vivo experimentation.
The success of these aims relies heavily on bridging computational and experimental approaches, justified by
the training and focus of the PI. Collectively, these objectives will begin with unbiased computational
approaches, validate using high-throughput in vitro assays and evaluate therapeutic potential of new endocrine
interactions using mouse models of disease."

 Poverty-related adversities place children at an increased risk for developing behavioral self-regulation
difficulties that disrupt their capacity to learn and thrive across the lifespan. With nearly 12 million children
growing up in poverty in the United States, this represents a monumental public health concern. Clarifying the
environmental determinants and underlying mechanisms that explain associations between poverty and child
self-regulation skills is central for the creation of policies that address families’ challenges while leveraging
extant strengths. Several complementary theoretical frameworks of early life adversity suggest that the
accumulation of economic deprivation and psychosocial threat, and their corresponding patterns of
(un)predictability, shape distinct developmental mechanisms that prepare children to meet the demands of their
specific environments. This project bridges novel methodological and theoretical approaches to characterize
dynamic patterns of change in early-life experiences in the context of poverty, and examine the role such
experiences play in shaping children’s self-regulation in early childhood.
 Early childhood is marked by substantial neurodevelopmental changes that support the emergence of
self-regulatory skills needed to meet the learning and psychosocial demands of schooling. Effects of poverty on
these developing regulatory systems are present as early as infancy, with more years spent at or below the
federal poverty line predicting greater self-regulation difficulties over time. Yet, how poverty leads to such
disparities remains largely unknown. The type, timing, and temporal variability in poverty-related experiences,
and their respective roles on contextually-adaptive self-regulation skills in early childhood, may be candidate
mechanisms underlying the effects of child poverty on long-term outcomes.
 The current project addresses two aims using data from a large mixed-methods national survey
(N~13,000) of predominantly low-income families during the pandemic. Aim 1 will apply innovative
psychometric, time-series, and qualitative approaches to understand what, when, and for whom
poverty-related experiences are most salient (1a), as well as how and under which conditions such
experiences unfold (1b). Aim 2 will leverage quasi-experimental methods (i.e., propensity scores) to test the
putative impact of experiences revealed in Aim 1 on children’s emerging self-regulation skills as they transition
to formal schooling. Findings will afford novel and timely insights into the complex ways in which early
poverty-related experiences affect children’s ability to thrive, with broad implications for public health and
well-being during a monumental point in history that calls for much-needed policy reform. Under the guidance
of Sponsors Fisher, Obradović, and Frankenhuis, the proposed research and training plan will prepare the
applicant for a career as an independent researcher focused on the basic, translational, and applied study of
child poverty and self-regulation."
11135254,"Autoimmune disease is one of the leading causes of death for young and middle-aged women in the US.
These diseases are mediated by autoreactive T cells, which are naturally contained by T regulatory cells
(Tregs). Non-functional mutations in the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) lead to autoimmunity due to deficiencies in Treg
survival and function. This finding is corroborated by in vivo mouse models, leading to the widespread
conclusion that IL-2 is important for Treg survival. However, recent data indicates this is oversimplified. Our lab
studies a mouse model in which the alpha chain (CD25) of the IL-2R on peripheral Tregs is conditionally
ablated. CD25 knockout Tregs demonstrate a disproportionate loss of central Tregs, which are long-lived
circulating Tregs that give rise to effectors to maintain self-tolerance. Bulk knockout Tregs also display
disruptions in critical Treg processes such as proliferation, survival, metabolism and suppressive function.
Additionally, there is an absence of highly suppressive terminally differentiated Tregs in IL-2R mutant animals,
indicating IL-2 may regulate the development of highly suppressive Tregs required for maintain peripheral
tolerance. Given these findings, IL-2 signaling controls processes that are essential for the prevention of
autoimmunity and understanding this role can provide therapeutic avenues to manipulate this population. Aim
1 will determine the effects of IL-2 on survival, proliferation, function and metabolism in Treg subsets.
Using flow cytometry and in vitro assays, proliferation, apoptosis, survival, function and metabolism will be
examined in Tregs subsets with and without IL-2 signaling. This aim will inform the extent to which IL-2
regulates cellular processes in Tregs subsets to further define the way by which IL-2 maintains Treg
populations. Aim 2 will evaluate the role of IL-2 in Treg differentiation and heterogeneity. Due to defects
observed in the differentiation of Tregs in the setting of IL-2, this aim will use adoptively transferred Treg
subsets with and without IL-2 signaling to determine how IL-2 regulates development of eTregs from cTregs.
Aim 3 will define the distinct IL-2 dependent transcriptional and epigenetic processes in cTregs versus
eTregs. This aim will harness high throughput techniques such as RNAseq and ATAC-seq to correlate
epigenetic and transcriptional changes as a consequence of IL-2 signaling, or lack thereof, in Treg subsets. By
defining IL-2-dependent pathways and cellular processes that differ between them, these findings will be
integrated with those in aim 1 to provide a clear role for IL-2 in regulating the cellular processes in each Treg
subset. The main objective of this fellowship research is to define IL-2 driven processes coordinating Treg
survival and homeostasis that are acutely relevant for understanding therapeutic applications of this cytokine
and broadly relevant for understanding autoimmune disease."

Urologic chronic pelvic pain syndrome (UCPPS) encompasses several common, costly diagnoses including
interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome and chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome that are poorly
understood and inadequately treated. Their prolonged personal and economic costs are amplified by the
frequent co-occurrence of a cluster of centralized pain conditions (particularly irritable bowel syndrome 3 [IBS])
but also fibromyalgia [FMS], chronic headache, chronic fatigue, etc.) called Chronic Overlapping Pain Conditions
(COPC). Clinically, the notion that these syndromes share a centralized pain phenotype with a fundamental
disturbance in pain or sensory processing dovetails with our preliminary research showing that a novel
transdiagnostic behavioral treatment emphasizing a single common mechanistic pathway (i.e. inflexible cognitive
style) reduces severity of both targeted (IBS) and untargeted multisymptom COPCs that include (but is not limited
to) to UCPPS, FMS, chronic fatigue, and chronic headache. If effective in a larger scale study, a transdiagnostic
UCPPS treatment would offer a more efficient, accessible, and broadly useful strategy for improving chronic
pelvic pain and its most frequent and complicating comorbidities. To this end, we will randomize 240 UCPPS
subjects (18-70 yrs.) of any gender and race to a 4-session version of CBT that teaches skills for self-managing
UCPPS symptoms (e.g. pelvic pain, urinary symptoms) with minimal clinician oversight (MC-CBT) or a four-
session non-specific education/support control (EDU). Efficacy assessments will be administered at pre-
treatment and two weeks after the end of the 10-week acute phase. We hypothesize MC-CBT will deliver
significantly greater UCPPS symptom improvement than EDU (Aim 1). Additional aims include characterizing
the durability of effects 3- and 6 months post treatment (Aim 2). To increase the efficacy and efficiency of
behavioral pain treatments, we draw upon Beck’s transdiagnostic cognitive model13 to characterize the precise
cognitive procedures and corresponding operative processes (e.g., cognitive distancing14, context sensitivity,
coping flexibility, repetitive negative thought) that drive MC-CBT induced UCPPS symptom relief relative to EDU
(Aim 3) as well as baseline patient variables that moderate differential response (Aim 3) with the ultimate goal of
more proactive patient-treatment matching fundamental to the goals of personalized medicine. By applying
innovative statistical modelling (e.g. dominance analysis, Randomized Explanatory Trial analyses) to study aims
in the context of a rigorously designed behavioral trial, we expand the portfolio of nondrug pain treatments for
UCPPS and co-aggregating COPCs to include one whose brevity, convenience, and transdiagnostic design
“meets patients where they are”20 and addresses the practical (access, complexity, cost), clinical (breadth,
durability, magnitude of effects, patient preference) and conceptual (untargeted comorbidities, non-pain somatic
symptoms) challenges that have impeded uptake and public health impact of evidence-based behavioral pain
treatments at a time when our most vulnerable high impact pain patients are in greatest need."

step toward understanding cellular processes. The goal of this proposal is to develop an
efficient method for the simulation of multi-protein systems consisting of many copies of a few

observation that the interaction energy between two proteins (or discrete protein conformations
within an ensemble) – can be efficiently calculated over the entire rotational-translational space
using the fast Manifold Fourier transform (FMFT) correlation approach. Given any conformation
of a complex multi-particle system, its energy can be easily obtained by summing the pairwise
interaction energies extracted from the lookup tables. The key innovation to efficiently
implement this method is our ability to compress and store the interaction energy lookup tables
in memory using wavelet sets. We will apply the method in two application. The first is
simulation of multi-protein assemblies and their association pathways, possibly in conjunction
with low resolution Mass Spectrometry (MS) and EM data, providing mechanistic insight into
cellular function. The second is simulation of protein aggregation and crowding, which is
important for the fundamental understanding of cell biology and therapeutic development."
10815764,"Major histocompatibility complex class I and class II (MHC-I/II) members are critical for antigen presentation and
adaptive immune responses but are downregulated in sporadic and genetic cases of duodenal and colorectal
cancer (CRC), such as Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP). There is an urgent need for novel approaches
to reverse MHC-I/II silencing and overcome tumor immune evasion, starting at the adenoma stage. Based on
the prior Critique, standard-of-care sulindac and erlotinib (SUL, ERL), and a new histone methyl `reader' inhibitor
MAK683 that shows clinical promise, will be repurposed for immune-based interception of FAP. From the rigor
of prior research and extensive preliminary data, the revised CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS is that low-dose ERL+SUL
combinations along with MAK683 upregulate MHC-I/II components to enhance immune surveillance via CD8
and CD4 T cell recruitment into preneoplastic and later stages of FAP. Low-dose, non-cytotoxic test agents and
their combinations augment MHC complexes at the cell surface to re-engage the host immune system for
anticancer efficacy, and will be translatable to FAP patients via oral administration with a good safety margin.
✓Aim 1 MECHANISMS Aim 1A Perform dose-response and time-course studies with ERL, SUL, MAK683 and
selected combinations for MHC-I/II upregulation in human and murine CRC, duodenal cancer, and adenoma
cells compared with normal cells. Aim 1B Corroborate for ERL, SUL and MAK683 the increased cell surface
occupancy of MHC-I/II complexes, coupled to enhanced cancer cell killing in CD8+ and CD4+ T cell co-cultures.

MAK683 via i.g. drug administration and corroborate histone methylation changes and immune target modulation
in colon and duodenal polyps for up to 14 days. Aim 2B Test the antitumor efficacy and safety of MAK683 alone
and combined with ERL or SUL in the Pirc model. Mechanistic targets will be validated via RT-qPCR, immunoblot
and multiplex CyTOF as predictors of antitumor efficacy. Aim 2C Test selected drug combinations in ApcMin/+,
ApcMin/+Nlrc5–/– and ApcMin/+Ciita–/– mice for insights into Nlrc5- and Ciita-dependent/independent mechanisms.

Aim 3B In FAP patient organoids, define MAK683, ERL and SUL doses that increase MHC-I/II-dependent gene
expression, and examine autologous effector functions and the capacity to kill tumor organoids in T cell co-

 The site-selective chemical modification of biomolecules including proteins and biologically active small
molecules is currently recognized as an important and unmet challenge in chemical biology. While current
strategies for chemical protein modification have proven highly enabling for a variety of applications related to
mechanistic biology and the production of biomaterials and pharmaceuticals, site-selective approaches are rare
and highly valued. The first Aim of this proposal details a strategy to access well-defined site-selectively labeled
protein conjugates for varied applications across chemical biology. Central to the thesis of this proposal is the
use of palladium oxidative addition complexes that have been previously shown by the Buchwald and Pentelute
labs to efficiently engage protein targets in C–heteroatom arylation reactions under mild physiological conditions.
The covalent derivatization of these palladium-based reagents with peptide sequences that bind a protein of
interest is proposed as a strategy to achieve site-selective protein cysteine arylation in both intra- and
intermolecular contexts. These technologies are expected to enable a myriad of applications including the
formation of site-selectively modified antibody-drug-conjugates and selective protein degrading platforms. In an
effort to significantly simplify drug structure-activity-relationship studies and produce valuable probes for
mechanistic biology, the second Aim of this proposal extends peptide-conjugated palladium arylation chemistry
to the regioselective modification of biologically-active small molecules. While current approaches to site-
selective small molecule derivatization generally operate on a narrow range of substrate classes and lack
generality, this proposal aims to deliver a general and highly modular approach to site-selective arylation of
complex polyol and polyamine targets, reliant on the well-defined secondary structure that peptide conjugates
impart about the Pd active site. Overall, the proposed the site-selective bioconjugation approach detailed in this
proposal will have the potential to be highly impactful for chemical biology by enabling powerful discovery
platforms for mechanistic biology and pharmaceutical applications. The objectives of this proposal are directly
related to the advancement of human health, are well aligned with the aims of the NIH.
 With the ultimate goal of securing an academic position at a major research university, the Buchwald

conduct my postdoctoral training in organometallic bioconjugation. The Buchwald lab’s expertise in metal-
catalyzed cross-coupling and its application to C–heteroatom bond forming processes and the Pentelute lab’s
focus within chemical biology and peptide synthesis will be instrumental in the execution of the proposed
research. During my training, I will gain crucial skills in chemical biology and organometallic chemistry that will
compliment my background in enantioselective organocatalysis, and prepare me to excel in a faculty position."

11196449,"Programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) targeted therapies have changed the landscape of lung cancer treatment1.
While some impressive results have been generated, the mechanisms that dictate which patients will, or will
not, respond to this treatment are not well defined. It is important to understand the immunological factors
associated with clinical responses not only to improve current therapies but also to identify predictive
biomarkers. We have recently identified a novel population of PD-1+ TCF-1+ CD28+ CD8 T cells with stem-
cell-like features in a mouse model of T cell exhaustion6-8. The proliferative burst of CD8 T cells after PD-1
blockade comes from this stem-like CD8 T cell population, and is dependent on signals from costimulatory
molecule CD28. Importantly, our preliminary data suggest that stem-like CD8 T cells are present in non-small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Based on our observations, we hypothesize that the stem- like CD8 T cells
play a critical role in successful PD-1 targeted therapies in NSCLC patients. One of the major goals of this
proposal is to identify and characterize these stem-like CD8 T cells in NSCLC patients. Another important point
to be addressed in this proposal is if the presence of these stem-like CD8 T cells correlates with proliferative

proposed to achieve our goals:
Aim 1: To identify and characterize the phenotype, location, and function of stem-like CD8 T-cells in

11196450,"Summary/Abstract:
Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide and the leading cause of cancer-related death in the US.
EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have improved outcomes for patients who have non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) with an activating EGFR mutation (EGFRMT), but many tumors do not respond and most that do will
become resistant in 9-12 months. Osimertinib, a 3rd generation EGFR TKI, has recently advanced to frontline
therapy for EGFRMT NSCLC, irrespective of T790M mutation, but treatment options remain limited for patients
who develop resistant tumors. This proposal describes preclinical studies to evaluate inhibition of the MERTK
receptor tyrosine kinase in combination with EGFR TKIs for treatment of EGFRMT NSCLC and includes a phase
1b clinical trial to test the combination in these patients. 70% of NSCLCs have abnormally high levels of MERTK
and inhibition in tumor cells decreases tumor growth in mice. MERTK is also present in immune cells in the tumor
microenvironment, where it suppresses the anti-tumor innate immune response. Our data suggest that inhibition
of MERTK reprograms the immune system to attack the tumor. MERTK can also mediate resistance to EGFR
TKIs, including osimertinib, suggesting that MERTK inhibition will sensitize EGFRMT tumors to treatment with
EGFR TKIs and may decrease development of resistance. These data identify MERTK as a new target in NSCLC
and implicate MERTK-targeted inhibitors as an unprecedented opportunity to provide a three-pronged
therapeutic approach in a single drug, leading to (1) direct tumor cell killing, (2) activation of anti-tumor innate
immunity, and (3) increased sensitivity to EGFR TKI therapy. To test this idea and generate drugs that can be
used in humans, we developed MERTK-selective TKIs, including MRX-2843. MRX-2843 is effective as
monotherapy in mice and increases sensitivity to EGFR TKIs in EGFRMT NSCLC cells. The proposed studies
use MRX-2843 and other MERTK inhibitors to investigate the effects of combined MERTK and EGFR inhibition
in cell culture and mouse models of EGFRMT NSCLC, including models with tumor cells implanted directly in the
lung, models derived from fresh patient samples, and models of tumor cell metastasis. Mice with mertk knock-
out will also be used to determine the effects of MERTK inhibition in the tumor microenvironment and its impact
on anti-tumor immunity. Additional studies will determine how MERTK inhibition in the immune system leads to
tumor rejection. Finally, a highlight of this project is the dedicated clinical trial of MRX-2843 and osimertinib in
patients with advanced EGFRMT NSCLC, a study that includes 2 expansion cohorts with paired collection of pre-
and post-treatment tumor biopsies and blood samples to evaluate biomarkers of MERTK inhibition, including
changes in immune function, following treatment with MRX-2843. The results from the clinical trial and
associated studies will provide more effective and less toxic treatment options leading to optimized care and
improved survival for patients with EGFRMT NSCLC."
10825584,"Project Summary:
We aim to understand the normal biology of neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs), as well as to use NMPs to
model cellular and molecular mechanisms in vivo. NMPs are basal progenitor cells located in the tailbud of
vertebrate embryos that continue to make a germ-layer decision after gastrulation to generate ectoderm and
mesoderm. As a primary source of cells generating the spinal cord, skeletal muscle, and other mesodermal
derivatives, NMPs are a key cell type contributing to the formation of the vertebrate body plan. Studying NMPs
has advanced our understanding of how body plans are generated, improved techniques for in vitro tissue
generation, and provided critical insights into signaling pathway mechanisms. I discovered zebrafish NMPs as
a postdoctoral fellow and my lab continues to focus on them. Our recent work has uncovered important roles
for the transcription factor Sox2 in maintaining NMPs in an undifferentiated state through interactions with the
canonical Wnt signaling pathway. This, combined with the past research showing the Wnt signaling effector
bcat physically interacts with Sox2, indicates Wnt signaling can modulate gene expression and biological
activity directly via Sox2. Little is known about this exciting branch of the Wnt/ bcat pathway. We will
interrogate this pathway of Sox2 and Wnt/ bcat interactions at a number of biological levels, focusing on direct
physical interactions between Sox2 and bcat, as well as genome wide analysis of Sox2/ bcat mediated
transcriptional regulation. We hypothesize that Sox2/ bcat signaling represents a new arm of the Wnt/ bcat
pathway distinct from the canonical TCF/LEF transcription factor family mediated signaling. We also recently
developed a new Cyclin Dependent Kinase biosensor transgenic zebrafish and observed that NMPs and some
of their derivatives exist in restricted cell cycle phases. The NMPs are held primarily in the G2 phase, while
mesodermal notochord progenitors are restricted to the G1 phase. Cell cycle phase is broadly implicated in
various aspects of stem cell maintenance, cell differentiation, and cell migration and invasion. We will
manipulate the cell cycle in NMPs and their derivatives to understand how the cell cycle phase impacts normal
NMP development. We hypothesize that the G2 phase restriction of NMPs is essential for maintenance of the
undifferentiated state and for receipt of Wnt signaling based on G2 dependent receptor activation. We also
hypothesize that the G1 phase of notochord progenitors is essential for their morphogenetic behavior of
convergence and extension. Together, our work will shed important light on not only NMP development and
vertebrate body plan formation, but also basic principles of cell biology and signaling. Wnt/ bcat signaling and
Sox2 are found together and play important roles in numerous normal and diseased cellular contexts, including
stem cells and cancer. The cell cycle is a fundamental aspect of normal development and is dysregulated in
diseases such as cancer. Understanding how cell cycle phase impacts cell fate and morphogenetic behaviors
in vivo will provide essential insight into normal and disease states."
10690184,"The incidence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among combat-experienced Veterans is ~20%,
which is substantially larger than in the general population (~3.5%). Moreover, 40-50% of Veterans suffering
PTSD are also diagnosed with substance use disorders (SUDs). Patients with comorbid PTSD and SUDs have
greater drug use severity and show poorer treatment outcomes than patients diagnosed with either PTSD or
SUDs alone. This special need of returning combat Veterans is largely unaddressed by preclinical research.
PTSD and SUDs share the DSM-V characteristic that environmental stimuli associated with a stressor or drug
use can precipitate symptoms of each disorder. Repeated drug use or acute stress produce enduring changes
in synaptic plasticity in a circuit containing the nucleus accumbens and ventral pallidum. Also, stress- and drug-
conditioned cues elicit drug seeking and stress behaviors by inducing transient synaptic plasticity at these
synapses. The first overarching hypothesis in our Merit renewal is that the neural circuits and cellular
mechanisms mediating conditioned stress contribute strongly to comorbid PTSD and SUDs.
 Cannabis is among the addictive drugs most widely abused by Veterans. During the current Merit Award
funding we used a rat model of cannabis (THC+CBD) self-administration in combination with acute restraint
stress as a rodent surrogate of comorbid PTSD and CUD (Cannabis Use Disorder). By associating an odor
with acute stress we studied the behavioral and neurobiological effects of conditioned stress and how drug use
alters those effects. We discovered that cannabis use changes and appears to exacerbate conditioned stress
behaviors. Given the high comorbidity between PTSD and CUD in Veterans, this is a clinically relevant
discovery that is the focus of the renewal Merit application. We are proposing to explore the neurbiological
underpinnings of how cannabis use is changing responses to stress-conditioned cues. We will focus on a brain
circuit known to be critical for conditioned responses, the projection from the nucleus accumbens to ventral
pallidum. Discoveries during the current Merit Award revealed that quantifying stress-cue induced synaptic
changes in the canonical pre- and postsynapse of the accumbens was insufficient to understand the
behaviorally relevant transient plasticity produced by stress cues. Accordingly, will also quantify signaling in the
protein-rich extracellular matrix that surrounds the synapse, and changes in perisynaptic astroglial processes
that regulate synaptic transmission through the patterned expression of proteins adjacent to the synaptic cleft.
Together, these four synaptic compartments are referred to as the tetrapartite synapse, and the second
overarching hypothesis of the Merit renewal is that cannabis use alters tetrapartite synapses in the accumbens
to pallidum pathway in a manner that changes cue-induced stress responses.
 The proposed Aim 1 characterizes the behavioral and synaptic effects of conditioned stress in combination
with THC+CBD or heroin self-administration using a modified defensive burying model of stress responding
that allows associations to be evaluated between stress behaviors and measures of tetrapartite synaptic
plasticity. Aim 2 employs the rat model to examine activity in cell-specific circuits within the accumbens-pallidal
pathway using single cell calcium imaging. Through completion of these Specific Aims, we expect to identify
brain circuitry and cellular mechanisms involved in how cannabis use alters conditioned stress responses that
can be explored in future studies as targets for pharmacotherapeutic intervention to treat the high incidence of
PTSD and comorbid CUD in our returning combat Veterans."

This application supports the launch of the innovative HIV Nexus Scholars Program at the University of
California, San Francisco (UCSF) under NIAID PAR-20-289. This program will leverage a rich infrastructure of
training, research, and expertise to address cross-cutting, high-priority areas in the 2019/2020 Office of AIDS
Research (OAR) Strategic Plan and NIAID mission, including the integration of state-of-the-art biomedical,
social/behavioral, and clinical science; health inequities research; and training and diversifying the research
workforce to conduct high-priority HIV research. Our program will provide three years of education, research
experiences, and mentoring to early-stage investigators (ESIs) from outside institutions who have not yet
attained R01-level funding, but who demonstrate a commitment to improving the health of U.S. marginalized
communities (e.g., racial, ethnic, sexual, and gender minorities) disproportionately affected by HIV, and are
initiating innovative research at the intersection of biomedical, social/behavioral, and clinical science. Scientists
from or closely connected to the most impacted communities are often best positioned to lead research that
addresses the specific needs of the affected populations, consistent with the objectives of the 2019/2020 Office
of AIDS Research Strategic Plan and the critical need to foster diverse scholars in the HIV research pipeline.
The centerpiece of the Nexus Scholars Program is an intensive six-week annual training institute in which
Scholars are in residence at UCSF for three consecutive summers, where they meet frequently with mentors,
connect with other researchers, participate in skills-development short courses/seminars, develop and
implement applied research experience plans, and conceptualize and write NIH funding applications. Such
training will provide a foundation for the next generation of HIV researchers who are prepared to continue and
outpace the recent momentum to end the HIV epidemic, particularly in communities disproportionately
affected."
10891473,"PROJECT SUMMARY: CORE C: GENOMICS AND TRANSCRIPTOMICS
The primary objective of Core C is to support the genomics and transcriptomics needs of the U54 FTD
Center without Walls. Utilizing pre-existing whole genome sequencing data from 721 patients with neu-
rodegenerative disease and healthy older adult controls, this Core will provide foundational information
regarding variation in tau metabolism pathway genes that will be directly interrogated by the Center
through its Projects. Additional gene candidates nominated by the Center will be screened by Core C for
relevance to human neurodegenerative disease. In parallel, this Core will generate a `tau polygenic risk
score' (TPRS) that will be used to stratify samples at high versus low genetic risk for tau-mediated neu-
rodegeneration. These samples will be studied by Project 2 to elucidate the cellular processes by which
tau is dysregulated in patients with varying degrees of genetic risk for tau-mediated neurodegeneration.
Core C will also support the bioinformatics and statistical needs of the Projects throughout the study
period, including analysis of bulk and single-nucleus transcriptomics data generated by Project 2. All of
this data will be integrated into an informational database, the `Tau Metabolism and Variant database'
(TMVdb), in collaboration with administrative Core A. The TMVdb will be regularly updated and both it
and the data used to generate it will be made available to the research community through an analytical
workbench interface. All of the Core's proposed activities will contribute to the Center's primary goal of
understanding how human genetic variation contributes to tau metabolism and homeostasis and will be
critical to its success."
10897904,"Abstract 
To restore high quality, usable vision in patients, it is important to develop regenerative therapies in models that share key features of the human visual system, particularly a fovea, the retinal area specialized for high acuity vision. Pre-clinical testing has been challenging due to both the absence of models of foveal vision loss and the difficulty of demonstrating restored function. Under previous AGI funding, the Advanced Retinal Imaging Alliance at the University of Rochester has recently overcome these challenges to create a pre-clinical testing platform leveraging adaptive optics technology to: 1.) Create localized regions of photoreceptor ablation in the fovea that are axially confined, and 2.) Optically read out restored retinal ganglion cell function by performing cellular scale calcium imaging in the living eye. This system was developed to meet the needs of photoreceptor replacement therapy, which requires photoreceptor loss with preserved host retinal circuitry. Furthermore, a high-resolution in vivo imaging approach is well suited for pre-clinical evaluation of regenerative therapies where the timescales of restored connectivity are unknown and functional integration occurs on the cellular scale. In this proposal, we will use our platform to generate pre-clinical data that will inform future clinical trials of photoreceptor replacement therapy in patients. Functional integration of transplanted photoreceptors with the host retina requires both high-density delivery of high-quality donor photoreceptors and a host retina with the capacity for synaptogenesis. We have assembled a consortium that can explore and optimize both sides of this interaction. In continued collaboration with a team at the University of Wisconsin led by David Gamm, a clinician and expert in photoreceptor replacement therapy, we will evaluate survival and functional integration of transplanted photoreceptor precursors delivered to the sub-retinal space as aggregates or following incorporation into custom biodegradable scaffolds. In collaboration with a team at University of California, Berkeley led by Teresa Puthussery, an expert in retinal remodelling in retinal degeneration models and retinal histology, we will examine the impact of the loss of photoreceptor signalling on inner retina. We will explore whether deafferented cone bipolar cells can remodel and functionally integrate with donor photoreceptors and whether retinal hyperactivity develops in the fovea as it does in rodent. To make meaningful progress toward restoring vision in patients who have lived with vision loss for many years, we will examine how these phenomena develop in the fovea over time and whether the regenerative potential of the host can be improved by therapeutic interventions such as retinoic acid blockers. These studies will allow us to fully characterize our novel photoreceptor ablation model and deploy it with photoreceptor replacement therapies to advance the field toward clinical trials."

The purpose of Core 4 Biostatistics is to provide statistical support to all the Projects in this P01. For the
association between clinical outcome and the comprehensive molecular and proteomic dissection of Richter's
syndrome (RS), as performed by Project 1, the Core will assemble and curate the clinical data provided by
internal and external collaborators and perform all analyses of association between these novel findings and
appropriate clinical parameters. This will include working closely with Project to assess in cfDNA any RS-specific
alternations that may predict this transformation. For all laboratory and animal studies of Projects 2 and 3, the
Core will assure that the design, conduct, and analysis of experiments use robust statistical techniques that are
appropriately implemented. For Project 2 this includes the single cell analyses of the tumor-intrinsic and tumor-
extrinsic features, as well as the longitudinal assessment of these features. The mice developing RS with
combinations of common CLL mutations (generated through this P01) will be assessed for response and
resistance to novel therapies and analyzed by this Core. DBP studies are performed through Project 3, and the
use of the Core for clinical association will permit Project 3 to remain blinded to clinical outcomes when
performing their assays, assuring an unbiased assessment of their predictive ability. Through these aims, this
central resource for the Projects will coordinate our insights into the trajectories from CLL to RS and support our
ability to identify rational and personalized therapeutic strategies that will offer patients an improved chance of
cure."
10912513,"Core A Summary Abstract
The purpose of the Administrative Core is to oversee the administrative responsibilities of the various laboratory
studies outlined in the Projects 1, 2 and 3 in this P01. The Administrative Core will provide high-level
organizational support for the Projects, including provision of necessary resources, fiscal oversight, adherence
to institutional and NIH guidelines/regulations. The Administrative Core will further coordinate regular joint
meetings to disseminate results, discuss scientific challenges, and discover innovative solutions to advance the
science. The Administrative Core will serve to integrate scientific efforts for sample collection and clinical factor
analysis within and between Projects through the (i) coordination of sample tracking and (ii) the retrieval and
data collection for all 3 Projects with institutions both within and outside of DFCI. The Administrative Core also
has responsibility for the submission/maintenance of regulatory documents related to samples. The
Administrative Core will further promote the rapid dissemination of significant research findings to the scientific
community. These activities will serve to enhance the integration of the rich scientific efforts within and between
Projects, and foster the translation of findings to the patient care setting; and conversely, the initiation of
laboratory studies stemming from clinical observations and tissue samples obtained in all 3 projects. Altogether,
this central resource for the Projects will enhance interactions among the investigative teams to further the
translational goals and vision of this Program for integrating genomic, functional and clinical information of
patients with Richter's Syndrome."
10927349,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Lower grade (World Health Organization (WHO) grade II/III) glioma (LGG), a malignant tumor of the brain, is a
uniformly fatal disease of young adults. The optimal clinical management for LGG remains unknown. A
comprehensive genomic characterization of the evolution from primary LGG to recurrence is required
to begin to address the LGG knowledge gap; optimizing the engagement of LGG patients in this effort
is critical to the success of this process. Using our International Low Grade Glioma Registry as a starting
point, we will construct a community of 700 LGG patients who have undergone surgical resection at time of
diagnosis and at time of recurrence and want to participate in research. We will use both hospital-based as
well as web- and social media-based patient engagement efforts and adapt pre-existing resources developed
at Yale including HUGO PHR, a secure cloud-based personal health record platform that allows secure and
permission-based movement of data bi-directionally between patients and researchers and ARCHETYP, a
Yale-developed software that assists patients in the location of clinical trials. We hypothesize that LGG
patient engagement and satisfaction (and thus overall participation) in genomic characterization
studies will be improved by 1) the ability to obtain and share medical record data with researchers, 2)
the availability of bi-directional communication between study and patients regarding study focus,
progress, outcomes as well as patient specific results, 3) improved messaging and education
regarding study and patient goals with respect to genomic characterization of patient materials. We
also propose that the knowledge gained in this application will provide a significant improvement in
the care of LGG patients."
10927351,"PROJECT SUMMARY: PARTICIPANT ENGAGEMENT UNIT (PEU)
Traditional epidemiological methods used to recruit patients with rare diseases such as LGG, who are
geographically widely spread, into research cohorts is costly, labor-intensive and time-consuming. Thus, there
is a need for alternative methods that include 1) engagement with patient stakeholders, 2) partnership with
patient organizations and 3) use of web-based collection methods and social media platforms. Using these
tools our group created the International Low Grade Glioma (LGG) Registry, the overarching goal of which is to
allow for focused study of LGG. In this Patient Engagement Unit and in collaboration with our Engagement
Optimization Unit (EOU) we will learn from pilot data drawn from the LGG Registry to refine effective means to
engage patients and other stakeholders in the development of messages, materials, and protocols for
recruitment, enrollment, and retention in the LGG Registry and use these means to 1) enroll 700 LGG patients
with recurrent disease into the International LGG Registry, 2) collect epidemiological, clinical, and outcome
data as well as constitutional (blood/saliva) and paraffin-embedded tumor specimens for these 700 LGG
patients and 3) communicate overall study and individual level results (including those performed by the
Genomic Characterization Unit) to the 700 LGG patients."
10817213,"PROJECT SUMMARY: METHODS CORE (C)
 Building off our success as a Core in the D-ARC, in this transition to a Full ARC, we will expand upon our
services and training in statistical analysis techniques, research design, qualitative approaches, mental health
(MH) measurement, and data management. Because of CHARM’s theme related to reducing the impact of MH
and minority health disparities across the HIV prevention and care continua, we focus on multi-level methods.
MH comorbidities are inherently individual-level processes. In contrast, MH and minority health disparities are
driven by higher-level structural socio-cultural processes that exist at the various levels (e.g., neighborhoods,
cities, regions) within which individuals are nested. Therefore, interventions and approaches of Center
investigators are likely to address both individual and socio-cultural processes and, thus, be multi-level.
 The Methods Core is responsible for promotion of state-of-the-science research design (statistical
methods and qualitative approaches) via consultation in multi-level research that will inform local
implementation of evidence-based practice consistent with CHARM goals. Activities to address this aim include
providing consultation to MH-HIV researchers developing grant proposals (as well as post-award support) and
supporting early-stage investigators with CHARM Developmental Core Awards Program studies in the areas of
research design, use of biomarkers of HIV and its comorbidities, and analytic strategies.
 To optimize resource-sharing and collaboration on MH-HIV research among CHARM investigators, the
Methods Core will expand a unified data architecture, centralized data repository, and collaborate across cores
on an instrument library. The voluntary unified data architecture includes common data elements to facilitate
collaboration and cooperative projects to utilize CHARM data in ways not possible in single studies. The Core
also maintains databases for both consent-to-contact databases implemented by the Mental Health Disparities
and Community Engagement Core and the CHARM REDCap Measures Library of well-established validated
instruments; including Spanish and Haitian Creole-language measures of constructs relevant to HIV and MH.
 Finally, the Methods Core provides triaged access to CHARM resources, state-of-the-science
methodology workshops, and other capacity-building activities focused on addressing MH disparities in HIV.
Via the CHARM Research Navigation Portal, investigators and community partners are provided coordinated
access to all CHARM resources, methodology consultations, and methods-focused workshops with content on
machine learning, reproducibility, multilevel modelling, geographically-focused analysis, intersectionality,
reliability and validity across populations, and model selection approaches. The Core also facilitates
consultations and presentations from other CHARM Cores and affiliated research groups, such as the CFAR,
CTSI, NIDA’s National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network, and NIDA’s P30 CHERISH Center,
which focuses on cost-effectiveness analysis."
10817215,"PROJECT SUMMARY: MENTAL HEALTH DISPARITIES AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT CORE (D)
 The Mental Health Disparities and Community Engagement (MHD-CE) Core in the Center for HIV and
Research in Mental Health (CHARM) provides specific services and activities to promote research to
understand, assess, and intervene with sociocultural and structural drivers at the intersection of HIV and
mental health disparities. Racial, ethnic, sexual, and gender minority populations are the least likely to benefit
from medical advances in HIV prevention and treatment, and the most susceptible to comorbid HIV-related
mental health (MH) problems (including substance use), affecting all aspects of the HIV prevention and care
continua. CHARM is located in a US HIV/AIDS epicenter and home to one of the largest populations of racial,
ethnic, and sexual/gender minority individuals placed at risk for and living with HIV/AIDS in the nation. The
environment includes multiple risks and disadvantages that set the stage for disparities in access to and
utilization of HIV and MH services and in HIV/AIDS and MH outcomes. Thus, the MHD-CE Core strives for
meaningful local impact as well as nationally contributions in order to end the HIV epidemic.
 The MHD-CE Core will further expand on our highly successful set of activities as a Developmental ARC
such as bringing the expertise of community members to the forefront to directly inform research priorities;
sponsoring the “Charming Conversations” Series; partnering with the Dev Core to support a community pilot
grant mechanism to fund pilot grants spearheaded by a community-based organization; implementing two
consent-to-contact databases (PLWH and community members); and equipping researchers with the tools and
expertise to conduct ethical, equitable, and high impact research with marginalized communities.
 As a Full Center, CHARM’s MHD-CE Core will continue to promote rigorous, multilevel, culturally competent
research addressing mental health (MH) struggles faced by communities most impacted by the HIV epidemic
due to racism, heterosexism, cisgenderism, and ethnocentrism. This will be accomplished by providing expert
consultation from a multidisciplinary team of investigators and clinicians in psychology, public health,
psychiatry, education, and medicine with expertise in HIV and mental health inequities and a broad range of
MH disorders common to PLWH or at risk for HIV; facilitating and maximizing the impact of community-
engaged and responsive mental health and HIV research through bi-directional collaboration of UM
investigators with community stakeholders; engaging potential research participants from hard-to-reach
populations placed at risk for HIV; informing content and providing access to measures of multi-level and multi-
domain constructs relevant to HIV and MH inequities; and hosting a Speakers series. The MHD-CE Core will
therefore promote innovative and theory-driven research approaches, stimulating research in synchrony with
CHARM’s mission of reducing the impact of mental health and minority health disparities across the HIV
prevention and care continua."

10927335,"SUMMARY
Efforts to diversify the trainee population in STEM and biomedical research in the US have achieved some
success. Nevertheless, diversifying the faculties of research institutions has lagged behind and remains a
significant challenge. This disturbing lack of parity is attributed to numerous factors, including disproportionately
high rates of attrition from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups during the transition from training into
faculty-level research careers, lack of adequate mentorship, bias and racism, and challenges associated with
securing extramural funding. The overarching goal of the Faculty Development Core (FDC) is to support faculty
development, mentoring, sponsorship, and promotion for the FIRST Cohort. We will implement a program of
professional development and career advancement tailored for a cohort/cluster model and intended to support
the research success of the individual members of the cohort and of the cohort as a whole. Our program will
combine mentoring/sponsorship, a curriculum of enhanced research skills development with support for
producing strong grant applications, social supports to help FIRST Cohort faculty navigate the specific
challenges and obstacles often faced by early-career faculty from underrepresented groups in science and
medicine, and opportunities for networking at all levels across our institution, within the local community, and in
the broader scientific community. The FDC will work closely with the Evaluation Core to track and assess metrics
of success. Activities will include 1) required mentor/sponsor training centered on bias reduction, anti-racism,
and mentoring for research success; 2) creation of individual development plans (IDPs); 3) mentor/sponsor
committees; 4) a focused and FIRST Cohort program to support the development of knowledge and skills around
building a successful research program and preparation of competitive grant applications. To reduce isolation,
build community, and promote well-being, we will implement an integrated program to enhance professional
development incorporating: 1) a cohort Coaching Team focused on work-life balance and well-being and on the
specific barriers faced by underrepresented groups in academic medicine; 2) a Professional Development
Workshop series to equip early-career faculty with strategies to improve their productivity and overall sense of
satisfaction; and 3) a program of individualized coaching; and; 4) peer mentoring. To create opportunities for
networking and increasing the visibility of FIRST Cohort faculty within our institution and beyond, we will identify
formal and informal networking opportunities that will begin immediately upon hire and which will evolve over the
period of the grant incorporating opportunities to network and engage with 1) faculty at all levels; 2) institutional
leaders; 3) the larger scientific community; and 4) local communities. The proposed FIRST Cohort program will
create a cohesive program of faculty development integrating various resources currently siloed at our institution.
The program can potentially serve as a model for other research-focused institutions committed to inclusive
excellence, and dissemination of best practices will be coordinated through the Center for Scientific Diversity."

The purpose of this proposed FIRST Cohort program is to transform our institutional culture at ISMMS by building
a self-reinforcing community of scientists committed to diversity and inclusive excellence. The goal of the
Evaluation Core (EC) is to develop a multi-method, multi-level, iterative evaluation plan to assess the success
and impact of our FIRST Cohort Program on the FIRST faculty and on our institution. Our EC team offers
expertise in the mixed-method approaches required to ensure optimal evaluation of ongoing institutional change.
Our evaluations of our FIRST Program will be guided by a hybrid model combining the validated PRECEDE-
PROCEED and Social Ecological Models (SEM). Briefly, we will evaluate whether our program’s activities lead
to the expected outcomes including: 1) the FIRST cohort’s research success; 2) enhanced inclusive excellence;

conduct regular, iterative evaluations to assess whether our Administrative and Faculty Development Cores are
meeting their targeted short-term and long-term milestones. Aggregated results from our evaluations will be
shared among all Cores to refine program activities and guide institutional policy. Accordingly, we propose the
following three Specific Aims. Aim 1. Test the primary hypothesis, as defined by the FIRST Cohort RFA, that a
Cohort/cluster model of faculty hiring will achieve significant improvements in institutional culture and research
success. Aim 2. Develop and implement an iterative evaluation plan to assess the FIRST Cohort program
implementation processes and short-term outcomes. Aim 3. Work with the FIRST Coordination and Evaluation
Center (CEC) to identify and harmonize a set of common data elements. To achieve these aims, we will use
validated observation strategies, qualitative and quantitative data collection methods, and assessment
measures. Our activities will be further supported by our Office of the Chief Research Informatics Officer (CRIO),
which provides a comprehensive set of external and internal IT resources that will facilitate our data collection
and management activities. Our EC plan includes procedures that allow us to redirect resources as needed to
best meet our program goals. We will collaborate with our Administrative Core, Faculty Development Core, and
the CEC across the entire 5-year program. In addition, we will ensure that planning, monitoring, evaluation, and
tracking of program activities will be continuous, shared as negotiated, and reported to the FIRST CEC.
Altogether, these activities will advance the scientific study of comprehensive strategies that can promote and
sustain a culture of inclusive excellence in order to better achieve an environment in which our FIRST Cohort
faculty and all members of our national academic community can thrive."
10928759,"PROJECT SUMMARY – CORE A
The Analytical Immunopharmacology Core (Core A) is designed to meet the specific drug and biologic
therapeutic development needs of each of the U19 Research Projects and at the same time draw on the strength
of the existing City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center (COHCCC) cores without unnecessary duplication
of services. Core A will work closely and synergistically with COHCCC cores, as well as with the U19
Administrative Core and the Molecular Profiling and Bioinformatics Core (Core B) to provide exceptional support
for all of the proposed Research Projects and inter-U19 collaborations. The overarching goals of Core A are to
assist the Glioblastoma Therapeutics Network (GTN) U19 Project Leaders with pharmacokinetic (PK) and
pharmacodynamic (PD) correlative studies performed in support of the proposed clinical trials. The work will be
accomplished by leveraging the Core’s significant expertise in intracerebral microdialysis (ICMD), analytical
chemistry, and analytical immunochemistry, as well as its access to state-of-the-art instrumentation. The overall
purpose will be achieved through the following Specific Aims:
Aim 1. Provide conceptual and analytical support to U19 investigators for correlative neuro-PK analyses
(e.g., analysis of drugs and metabolites in the CNS). Support provided by Core A to U19 investigators under
this aim will include all aspects of ICMD neuro-PK studies, including experimental design, analytical method
development, sample analysis, and final interpretation of the data. Core A is staffed by highly trained personnel
and equipped with analytical instrumentation that will be ideal for the quantitative analyses of small molecules
(e.g., LC-MS/MS and ICP-MS/MS).
Aim 2. Provide conceptual and analytical support to U19 investigators for their correlative neuro-PD
analyses (e.g., analysis of biomarkers of drug response in the CNS). Support provided by Core A to U19
investigators under this aim will include all aspects of ICMD neuro-PD studies, including experimental design,
analytical method development, sample analysis, and final interpretation of the data. Core A will provide a
spectrum of immunoassay platforms (e.g., Luminex and ELISA) in the context of ICMD neuro-PD studies in
support of the proposed clinical trials."
10928762,"PROJECT SUMMARY – CORE B
The U19 Molecular Profiling and Bioinformatics Core (Core B) will provide state-of-the-art genomics and
bioinformatics technology and expertise to advance each of the projects in the City of Hope U19 program. In
anticipation of delivering on the larger mission of the Glioblastoma Translational Network (GTN), Core B will
provide CAP-certified, CLIA-approved exome and transcriptome sequencing that returns data for patient care
decision-making. Core B bridges bench discovery of molecular determinants of glioblastoma vulnerability to the
three novel agents in this U19 and the clinical setting, in which precision use of these treatments may have the
highest likelihood of benefiting patients. Core B will achieve this by: A) Providing comprehensive CLIA-certified
genomic profiling for patients enrolled on our U19 clinical trials, as well as genomic sequencing of preclinical
models, and offering single cell/nuclei transcriptomic analyses of harvested cell infiltrates collected from the
tumor bed following resection or dispersed tissue. These studies will provide granular insight into tumor
heterogeneity, tumor sensitivity or resistance, and tumor evolution. B) Identifying signatures of vulnerability to
the agents being evaluated. For Project 1, GBM exome and transcriptomic data will be analyzed to identify
features that modify susceptibility to oncolytic herpes virus infection, the impact of alleles of genes that play a
role in HSV replication, and deconvolution of patient tumors to depict the host cell infiltrate comprising the
pretreatment microenvironment immune status of syngeneic models and glioma patients enrolled in the oncolytic
virus/anti CD-47 clinical trial. For Project 2, exome and transcriptome data from tumors of patients enrolled in
the clinical trial evaluating tasquinimod will be deconvoluted to discern populations of immune cell infiltrates to
compare with post-treatment single cell transcriptomic analysis of resection cavity fluid collected from surgically
placed catheters. Tumors from syngeneic glioma models receiving different treatments will analyzed by single
nuclei transcriptomics for cell deconvolution. For Project 3, we will further develop a synergy signature indicative
of GBM vulnerability to the combination of pevonedistat + etoposide, leading to a patient-enrichment strategy for
future clinical trials. Preliminary data indicates that PTEN status (copy number, mutation, expression levels)
serves as a determinant for likelihood of response to the neddylation inhibitor, pevonedistat, as well as the
synergistic activity of etoposide (TOP2A inhibitor) with pevonedistat. C). Deliver state-of-the-art biomedical
informatics and data analytics expertise and services. Core B will provide state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods,
including machine learning techniques, to derive highest value from the preclinical and clinical data in each
project. Core B will also foster data and information exchange and collaboration with individual Projects/Cores
across the GTN. The long term goal of Core B is to participate in the design, development, and adoption of an
adaptive, signature-guided umbrella clinical trial supporting all new treatments emerging from the GTN."
10928767,"PROJECT SUMMARY – PROJECT 1
The combination of oncolytic virotherapy (OV) and monoclonal antibody (mAb) immunotherapy has great
potential for the treatment of glioblastoma (GBM), the most common malignant brain tumor without a cure. An
OV carrying a mAb-coding gene can produce and release the mAb drug specifically at the tumor site as a safe,
effective, and innovative delivery system. Prior to our study, this approach has not been previously explored
using herpes simplex virus 1-based OV (oHSV). CD47 is a transmembrane protein widely expressed on cancer
cells including GBM. It acts as a “don’t eat me” signal by functioning as a ligand to signal regulatory protein-α
(SIRPα) expressed on macrophages, resulting in inhibition of phagocytosis. We have generated an oHSV that
expresses a full-length anti-CD47 mAb on an IgG1 scaffold (OV-αCD47-G1) that is capable of inducing antibody-
dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) by macrophages and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)
by natural killer cells to eradicate GBM cells in vitro and in vivo, in addition to blockade of the CD47-SIRPα “don’t
eat me” signaling pathway in macrophages. We have demonstrated that our novel OV-αCD47-G1 significantly
improves the survival of GBM-bearing mice in orthotopic, immunocompetent, and immunodeficient models. Our
central hypothesis is that OV-αCD47-G1 will be safe and effective at improving GBM treatment and its anti-
tumor activity in the brain will be reflected by markers in the peripheral blood. Importantly, we have optimized
and manufactured GMP-grade OV-αCD47-G1 to conduct the proposed studies and will initiate a phase I clinical
trial for adults with GBM. In this proposal, we will evaluate both the systemic and regional immune responses in
vivo following clinical-grade OV-αCD47-G1 administration and identify markers in the circulation that correlate
with anti-tumor activity in the brain in GBM animal models (Aim 1); we will perform Investigational New Drug
(IND)-enabling in vivo safety and efficacy studies using clinical-grade OV-αCD47-G1 (Aim 2); and we will
determine the safety of administering a single intracerebral infusion of OV-αCD47-G1 in adult patients with
recurrent GBM (Aim 3). To accomplish these objectives, we will utilize immunocompetent and
immunocompromised GBM mouse models for our correlative and preclinical studies evaluating OV-αCD47-G1
prior to the phase I clinical trial. Upon conclusion, we will understand how to optimize OV-αCD47-G1 therapy to
cure GBM. Further insight into this process, as will result from the implementation and completion of this
proposal, is impactful as it will ultimately lead to a reduction in mortality for adults suffering from GBM."
10928772,"PROJECT SUMMARY – PROJECT 2
Although immunotherapy has significantly improved patient survival for many types of cancers, to date no
immunotherapeutic agent has shown consistent efficacy against glioblastoma (GBM). Many promising
immunotherapy approaches for GBM are administered in the peri-operative period, but, unfortunately, for GBM
patients two surgery-related factors work against the success of these immunotherapies: 1) Most GBM patients
are treated peri-operatively with high doses of dexamethasone, which suppresses the immune system, and 2)
surgical brain injury from tumor resection results in a substantial release of cytokines and chemokines that alter
the tumor milieu and support tumor regrowth. Our preclinical data demonstrate the significant role that the
receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) pathway plays in the brain’s inflammatory response to
surgical brain injury and that the RAGE ligand S100A9 is a key intermediary. The overall goal of this research
project is to repurpose tasquinimod, an anti-inflammatory small molecule inhibitor of S100A9, by developing it
as an immunotherapy adjunct that will control cerebral edema while diminishing post-surgery activation of the
pro-tumor inflammatory response, thus creating a tumor microenvironment that enhances the efficacy of
immunotherapies administered in the peri-operative period for the treatment of GBM. We will begin by performing
a phase I safety and feasibility study to determine the maximum tolerated dose of tasquinimod when
administered in combination with relatively low doses of dexamethasone peri-operatively in GBM patients who
undergo tumor resection (Aim 1). We will assess the ability of tasquinimod to reverse myeloid-induced
immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (Aim 2) by measuring changes in concentrations of cytokines
and RAGE ligands in the peritumoral brain interstitium with intracerebral microdialysis and evaluating changes
in levels of these inflammatory markers as well as immune cell populations in resection cavity fluid. To determine
the immune-modulatory effect of tasquinimod when used in combination with immunotherapy approaches that
are administered during the peri-operative period (Aim 3), we will perform preclinical in vivo studies to assess
the efficacy of tasquinimod in combination with PD-1 inhibitors, oncolytic viruses, and CAR T cells. By inhibiting
the activity of myeloid-derived suppressor cells, tasquinimod could enhance the anti-tumor activity of these
emerging immunotherapy technologies, leading to increased efficacy against GBM. Successful completion of
these aims would provide a strong foundation to support development of future clinical trials to assess use of
tasquinimod alone for controlling cerebral edema and to evaluate tasquinimod in combination with the most
promising immunotherapy approach determined in Aim 3 with the goal of improving outcomes for patients with
GBM."
10928779,"PROJECT SUMMARY – PROJECT 3
The ubiquitin/proteasome system maintains intracellular homeostasis via degradation of unwanted proteins.
Neddylation is a specific pathway within the ubiquitin/proteasome system that is overactive in glioblastoma
(GBM), and whose upregulation has been associated with glioma progression and worse survival. Pevonedistat
is a first-in-class small-molecule neddylation inhibitor shown to impact protein degradation and inhibit growth of
GBM cells in culture and orthotopic xenografts. Pevonedistat is in clinical trials and available through NCI’s
Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP). Because the molecular heterogeneity within and across GBM
patients obscures therapeutic targets and obfuscates signals of efficacy in clinical trials, we propose the use of
molecular “signatures of vulnerability” to targeted agents in subsets of models, and to use these signatures to
guide patient enrollment in early-stage clinical trials. Our preliminary data revealed molecular determinants of
synergy against PTEN-deleted (PTENdel) and PTEN-mutated (PTENmt) GBM from combining pevonedistat with
a TOP2A inhibitor, etoposide. We hypothesize that a specific “synergy signature” can be used to identify patients
likely to respond to pevonedistat + etoposide and propose a signature-guided clinical trial to achieve synergy in
patients with recurrent GBM (rGBM). We propose the following Aims: Aim 1. Discover and validate the
mechanism underlying the antitumor synergy of pevonedistat + TOP2Ais in GBM. We will use GBM
patient-derived xenograft (PDX) explant cultures and orthotopic tumors to pursue this aim and will validate the
predictive performance of the “synergy signature” in patient tumor samples from the proposed clinical trial in
Aim 3. Aim 2. Validate a “signature of vulnerability” to pevonedistat alone in GBM. We will use GBM PDX
cultures and orthotopic models to refine and test the predictive accuracy of a “signature of vulnerability” to
pevonedistat for future clinical trials. Aim 3. Determine the safety of pevonedistat + etoposide in “synergy
signature” rGBM patients in a phase I clinical trial. We will enroll patients with “synergy signature” GBM to a
phase I study of pevonedistat + etoposide to determine the maximum tolerated dose/recommended phase II
dose of the combination therapy; obtain preliminary response data; define the neuropharmacokinetic (nPK) of
pevonedistat using intracerebral microdialysis; and evaluate the neuropharmacodynamics (nPD) of
pevonedistat using a window of opportunity design in subsets of study participants. This project relies on support
from Core A for nPK analysis, Core B for exome and RNA Seq and bioinformatics, and the Admin Core for
coordination and integration with Projects 1 and 2 for data sharing and comparison of signatures of vulnerability
to OV-αCD47-G1 and tasquinimod. If successful, our project will advance drug development in the setting of a
heretofore recalcitrant tumor by linking molecular subsets of GBM with both drug discovery/development and
patient recruitment for highest likelihood of conveying precision medicine into the care stream."

The large randomized multicenter Chronic Hypertension and Pregnancy (CHAP) trial (2015-2021) was
designed to evaluate the short-term benefits and safety of pharmacologic treatment of pregnant women with
mild chronic hypertension (CHTN). This proposed CHAP Maternal Follow-Up project (2021-2026) is a follow-up
study of the well-characterized women in CHAP to address the critical knowledge gaps regarding whether
future long-term cardiovascular disease (CVD) and other outcomes are associated with 1) antihypertensive
therapy use early in pregnancy and 2) the development of superimposed preeclampsia (SI PRE). CHTN is the
most common major medical disorder seen in pregnancy, is most often mild (i.e. BP <160/110 mmHg), and
associated with adverse outcomes, including preeclampsia, death, preterm birth and small for gestational age
(SGA) infants (birth weight <10th percentile). Whereas antihypertensive therapy is a priority for the general
population, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), recommends withholding
antihypertensive therapy during pregnancy unless CHTN is severe (BP≥160/110 mm Hg) due to uncertain
benefits and concern that therapy may increase the risk of SGA infants. An international controversy regarding
optimal treatment during pregnancy will be informed by these data on long-term outcomes. Whereas
preeclampsia in women without CHTN increases their future risk of CHTN and CVD, the long-term effects of SI
PRE and antihypertensive therapy in women with preexisting CHTN are uncertain. During this proposed 5-
year project, our consortium of up to 60 sites, will follow-up the CHAP participants every 6 months (in-person
or remotely, review medical records and administer questionnaires) to obtain interval history, serial BPs and
outcome data, and collect bio-specimens. We anticipate 1804 (75%) of the 2404 in CHAP will be studied to
address the following Specific Aims:
Specific Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that antihypertensive therapy for mild CHTN during pregnancy to achieve
a BP goal <140/90 compared with no treatment reduces the frequency of maternal CVD outcomes 5 to 10
years postpartum, including the primary composite of severe CHTN (a marker of future CVD), heart failure,
stroke, myocardial infarction/angina, renal failure, venous thromboembolism (VTE) or death.
Specific Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that the development of SI PRE in pregnant women with mild CHTN
increases the risk of maternal CVD outcomes 5 to 10 years postpartum, including the primary composite of
severe CHTN, heart failure, stroke, myocardial infarction/angina, renal failure, VTE and death.
Specific Aim 3 (Exploratory): Test whether available components of the ACC/AHA ASCVD risk score (age,
race-ethnicity, diabetes mellitus, smoking status, baseline BP, pre-pregnancy treatment) and pregnancy data
(treatment and SI PRE) in women with mild CHTN predict maternal CVD outcomes 5-10 years postpartum. We
will also collect and store maternal blood and urine for future biomarker and biological studies."

 Vocal fold (VF) mucosa is critical to vocal quality; poor healing ability and limitations of surgical repair have
motivated strategies to engineer living tissue replacements. A lack of fundamental understanding of the
complexity of VF mucosa's cellular and spatial heterogeneity is largely responsible for incremental progress
being made in VF tissue engineering. The overall objective of this proposal, which is a necessary step towards
achieving our long term goal of engineering replacements for VF mucosa, is to link single-cell RNA sequencing
and spatial transcriptomics, at exceptional resolution, to characterize VF morphogenesis across time, location
and cellular compartments and in response to injury. We will create large-scale single cell spatiotemporal
atlases of VF mucosa. In specific aim 1 we will identify and characterize murine VF cell populations and their
spatial distribution through embryonic and postnatal development. In specific aim 2 we will identify and
characterize human VF cell populations and spatial distribution across the lifespan. Results will provide
markers for characterization of proper tissue assembly and maintenance, which can then be applied as design
parameters for tissue engineering approaches. Cross-species validation will be a powerful strategy for
optimization, to prioritize genes and pathways for further investigation. Work in specific aim 3 will molecularly
profile cell subsets involved in VF injury and repair in a murine mucosa injury model. We will identify
subpopulations of fibroblasts and epithelial cells that respond to injury. Characterizing the relationship
between specific cell subpopulations, their interactions, spatial location and pathways involved in VF injury and
repair, will identify therapeutic avenues to mitigate VF scarring. The innovative use of transcriptional profiling
as an anchor of our research strategy, will provide differentiation criteria and vital tissue engineering design
parameters that can be used for the regeneration of new, normal VF mucosa."

 This application focuses on the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei, which is transmitted among
mammalian hosts by tsetse-flies and, due to effective immune evasion, causes chronic and lethal infections,
specifically African sleeping-sickness in humans and nagana in cattle. Whereas human African trypanosomiasis
has been declining recently, livestock infections remain prevalent and have a profound effect on economic
development in sub-Saharan Africa. There are no vaccines and therapeutic drugs have serious side effects and
decreasing efficacy. Thus, there is a pressing need for research to better understand the biology of these
pathogens and the mechanisms they use to survive within their hosts. T. brucei undergoes a complex life cycle
between the mammalian host and the blood-feeding tsetse fly vector. To cope with the changing environment,
the parasite transitions through distinct life cycle forms that have evolved to assure survival and successful
transmission to the next host. For instance, when residing in the mammalian host, T. brucei expresses a
variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) coat, which is the paradigm for antigenic variation. Although there are
hundreds of VSG genes in the genome, bloodstream-form VSG expression is restricted to 1 of about 15
specialized telomeric bloodstream expression sites (BES). In the salivary glands of the insect vector metacyclic
trypanosomes are covered by a specific and small subset of VSGs, the metacyclic VSGs (mVSGs), which
enable transmission to a vertebrate host. mVSG expression is triggered by an unknown mechanism and in
vitro can be achieved in the absence of tsetse tissues by induced expression of the RNA-binding protein 6
(RBP6). One major goal of this application will be to examine how trypanosomes receive instructions to begin
synthesizing the mVSG coat, and when each cell begins expressing a single mVSG. We will use single-cell
RNA-Seq and long-term live-cell imaging to answer mechanistic questions. In addition, our novel finding that
mVSG genes encode an exonic splicing enhancer exposed a completely new aspect of VSG regulation and
may explain the tightly-controlled extremely high output of mature mRNAs."

Food insecurity affects one in seven households with children in the United States and disproportionately
impacts those headed by women and minorities. Food insecurity is associated with childhood obesity, asthma,
anxiety and depression and behavioral problems, and thus contributes to health disparities. While food
insecurity likely contributes to poor health through its effect on diet, such a simplistic understanding likely
obscures the effects of stress – those unique to childhood, such as Adverse Childhood Experiences including
maternal depression, as well as those generally associated with the experience of poverty. To inform the
mechanisms by which food insecurity ultimately affects physical and mental health outcomes in children, this
study will disentangle the effects of food insecurity from those of poverty and examine effects on diet,
biomarkers, weight gain, mood and behavior while considering other childhood adversities. Specifically,
through a unique summertime meal provision intervention, the proposed project will isolate the experience of
food insecurity in children, ages 8-12 years, from low-income households in Providence, RI. In partnership with
the YMCA of Greater Providence and the Healthy Communities Office in Providence, we will recruit 100
children over two summers. After completing a baseline assessment, participants will be randomized to the
Food Insecure or Food Secure groups. Children randomized to the Food Insecure group will experience the
natural onset of summertime food insecurity and receive a weekly newsletter on community resources that is
not expected to affect food insecurity. Those randomized to the Food Secure group will remain food secure
over the summer through receipt of weekly shipments of five breakfast and lunch meals that meet the nutrition
needs of this age group. Primary endpoints include diet quality, biomarkers of Metabolic Syndrome,
inflammation, and stress, BMI z-scores, and child measures of behavior and anxiety and depression
symptoms. We will also explore the impact of caregiver mood and stress on the health effects of food
insecurity. Ultimately, findings from this research will clarify the mechanisms by which food insecurity affects
child health outcomes and inform how to more effectively prevent food insecurity. They will also provide the
foundation for an R01 application and further training for Dr. Evans (PI) to establish an independent research
career focused on understanding the role of diet in the prevention of health disparities in disadvantaged youth."

 The function of the intervertebral disc is mechanical. but disc pathology and LBP is currently evaluated in
terms of structural changes, “structural degeneration (s-degen)”, observed from static images, and not in
terms of mechanical function changes. While s-degen is considered to be related to pathology, it has had
little clinical success discriminating pathology from natural aging. Ex vivo studies have found s-degen is related
to progressive degradation of material properties that implies loss of mechanical function, “functional
degeneration (f-degen)”, but f-degen remains unquantified in vivo because there is no technique to measure
it. Lack of information regarding in vivo mechanics hinders matching symptoms to individual discs and,
furthermore, translation of ex vivo results and models to the in vivo context. To study and treat LBP, a
technique needs to be developed to quantify disc mechanical function in vivo. MRI is the preferred non-
invasive platform to study and diagnose disc health. Unfortunately, current MRI assessment based on a single
supine posture is insufficient to assess disc mechanical function. Mechanical function must be determined by
how the disc responds to changes in loading state. Therefore, MRI studies of the disc performed under loading
states brought about by different spine positions could be used to quantify disc mechanics in vivo. There is a
critical need to develop and apply a quantitative, noninvasive in vivo assessment of disc mechanical function
and f-degen. The consequence of failing to address this need is hindering efforts to determine mechanisms of
disc pathology and to develop and assess new therapies. The goal of this proposal, is to noninvasively quantify
disc mechanical function in vivo and establish a new degeneration classification that incorporates f-degen
(mechanical function changes) in addition to subject traits (age, sex) and s-degen (structural changes), and to
predict the disc's internal stress and strain for in vivo movements. The central hypothesis is that aging and disc
degeneration are related to altered mechanical function as assessed in vivo from changes in MRI variables
with prescribed loading (morning-to-evening and supine-to-flexed/extended). We propose to:
Aim 1: Quantify functional degeneration (f-degen) from in vivo MRI changes between loading states.
Aim 2: Create an ex vivo ↔ in vivo translation by replicating in vivo deformation states in separate ex
vivo donor specimens. Correlate MRI f-degen with degradation in disc- and tissue-scale material properties.
Aim 3: Predict disc stress and strain for in vivo movements using a finite element model linked to MRI.
Completion of these aims will yield a new in vivo image-based statistical classification of normal and
degenerative disc function. It will provide meaningful and predictive relationships describing human disc
physiology and pathophysiology, replacing the inadequate structural grading systems that are the current
standard, and will provide new capabilities to measure and predict disc biomechanics in vivo."

Insulin treatment dramatically improves the health of people with diabetes, and is usually administered as a daily
long-acting insulin and a prandial fast-acting insulin. Despite considerable success, a number of important
challenges remain, including three major limitations that are addressed in this proposal. First, even the best
clinically-available fast-acting insulins are too slow and last too long to provide tight control of serum glucose
within the physiological range, resulting in substantial excursions outside of this range and chronic hyperglycemia
or acute hypoglycemic complications. Second, currently available insulins require continual refrigeration to avoid
aggregation, whereas therapeutic insulins that do not require cold-chain delivery would offer considerable
advantages, especially for use in long-term insulin pumps and in circumstances where electrical power is
unreliable. Third, because insulin stimulates two signals, one therapeutically advantageous for metabolic control
(Akt pathway) and one therapeutically concerning for mitogenic growth (Erk pathway), there is interest in
developing analogs that preferentially stimulate the Akt pathway. This proposal takes a biochemical and
structure-based approach to gain mechanistic insight to each of these concerns, including cryo-EM structure
determination of receptor-ligand complexes complemented by a variety of approaches, including cell signaling
and mouse glucose-responsiveness studies. Aim 1 focusses on two humanized variants of cone snail venom
insulins, which lack residues that make native insulin dimeric and inherently slow acting upon subcutaneous
injection, and have been engineered to provide fast response, short duration of action, and high potency. Aim 2
focusses on approaches to render insulins resistant to aggregation/fibrillation, including following up on the
surprising finding that one of the humanized venom insulins is highly resistant to aggregation. Aim 3 explores
the remarkable property of some receptor ligands to elicit biased signaling that emphasizes either the Akt or the
Erk pathways, and offers potential to understand the structural basis for these effects. Completion of these aims
will provide fundamental mechanistic insights and inform efforts to develop improved therapeutics."

PD-1 is a key immune checkpoint receptor that dampens T cell function. While extensive studies have
investigated how PD-1 modulates T cell effector function in cancer settings, how PD-1 regulates systemic
autoimmunity and humoral immunity remains poorly defined. Clinically, immune checkpoint inhibitors, including
anti-PD-1, induces inflammatory arthritis immune related adverse events (IA-irAE), but the underlying
mechanisms and the relationship between IA-irAE and classic rheumatic diseases are unexplored. Importantly,
no autoimmune animal models exist that permit direct analysis of clinically-used anti-PD-1 antibodies because
they do not interact with mouse PD-1. We utilize novel humanized PD-1 and PD-L1 mouse models to
investigate the mechanisms by which clinically-used anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 biologics modulate humoral
immune response in a classic collagen induced arthritis model. Furthermore, through comparative analysis of
clinical data and immunological profiles between anti-PD-1 induced IA-irAE and rheumatoid arthritis, we
uncover remarkable similarity between IA-irAE and seronegative rheumatoid arthritis, a hitherto little
understood form of systemic autoimmunity. Our central hypothesis is that anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 biologics
induces T cell-dominating and antibody-independent autoimmune toxicity, and impaired PD-1
signaling is a contributing factor to IA-irAE and seronegative rheumatoid arthritis (RA). To test this
hypothesis, we will (1) To determine the immunopathology and molecular mechanisms of clinically-used PD-1
and PD-L1 blockade mediated autoimmune diseases, and (2) To investigate how dysregulation of PD-1
signaling contributes to IA-irAE and seronegative RA in human subjects. Building on our clinical and basic
research expertise and innovations that integrate novel mouse models, innovative pharmacological
interventions and comparative patient cohort analysis, our research will address fundamental questions in PD-
1 signaling, humoral immunity, and systemic autoimmunity, with direct relevance to the improvement of clinical
practice and patients’ wellbeing. Additionally, our study will provide a valuable animal model as a research tool
for the field of irAE."
10841057,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Cocaine use disorder (CUD) remains a serious problem, with approximately 5.2 million people reporting
cocaine use in the U.S. and nearly 1.3 million reporting CUD in 2020. CUD is a chronic disorder with high rates
of relapse to cocaine-seeking behavior. Moreover, exposure to stress induces increases in cocaine craving
which have been found to predict relapse to cocaine use in cocaine-dependent patients. Unfortunately, there
are currently no approved pharmacological treatments for either CUD or stress-induced potentiation of CUD.
 Kappa opioid receptors (KOR) have emerged as a promising target for the potential treatment of CUD.
KOR and their endogenous peptide agonists, the dynorphins, prominently modulate drug reward. Exposure to
stress increases levels of dynorphin peptides and is known to paradoxically potentiate cocaine reward and
promote relapse to drug use in abstinent individuals. In animal models, treatment with KOR antagonists
ameliorates stress-induced potentiation of cocaine reward and prevents stress-induced reinstatement of
extinguished cocaine-seeking behavior, suggesting that KOR antagonists could serve as novel
therapeutics for CUD and stress-induced CUD.
 We have identified novel systemically active cyclic peptides that selectively antagonize KOR and show
therapeutic benefits in an animal model of stress-induced relapse to CUD. The proposed research focuses on
these novel, orally active peptide KOR antagonists, with the goal of optimizing lead cyclic peptides to yield
candidates for further development as potential treatments for CUD and stress-induced potentiation of CUD.
The UG3 phase consists of two specific aims: 1) further characterize existing promising analogs synthesized
previously for potential development; and 2) perform focused structural modifications on the lead cyclic
peptides in preparation for the UH3 phase of the research. Analogs will be assessed for their pharmacokinetic
properties and in vitro KOR affinity, selectivity and antagonist potency, with promising analogs evaluated in
vivo after oral administration for their KOR antagonist potency and in rodent models of cocaine reward
(conditioned place preference and intravenous self-administration assays) for therapeutic efficacy in preventing
stress-induced potentiation of cocaine reward and stress-induced reinstatement of extinguished cocaine-
seeking behavior. The UH3 phase continues this work and consists of two additional specific aims: 3)
expanding the exploration of the structure-activity relationships of the lead cyclic peptides to improve their
pharmacokinetic properties and enhance pharmacological potency in vivo, and 4) perform additional safety
studies needed to advance the most promising compounds into development for clinical use. Given the
success of our preliminary data identifying promising lead cyclic peptide KOR antagonists, we expect at the
end of the proposed research to have identified at least one analog for development as a potential treatment of
CUD."

10909948,"Project Summary:
 GABAergic interneurons are central to the normal development and function of neocortical circuits. In
particular, cells that express the peptide somatostatin (SST-INs) are thought to play critical roles in both
spontaneous and sensory-evoked neuronal activity, primarily via their robust inhibition of the dendrites of
excitatory pyramidal neurons. However, the functional roles of the diverse classes of SST-INs in deep cortical
layers remain unknown. Furthermore, whereas the role of SST-INs in superficial cortical layers of adult animals
has been well characterized, their function in the infragranular layers is unknown. Our preliminary data suggest
the properties of SST-Ins vary across different cortical layers and thus may serve different roles. To further
explore this observation, we propose to combine a number of methodological approaches, including optogenetic
manipulations, 2-photon and viral tracing. We will test the following hypotheses: (1) SST-IN populations in
superficial and deep layers of visual cortex have distinct responses and differentially regulated by behavioral
state due to differences in presynaptic inputs. (2) SST-IN populations are functionally distinct across the layers
and differ in their impact on sensory processing. Our results will provide an unprecedented level of insight into
the function of SST-INs and their relationship to visual processing in the neocortex."
10928703,"Project Summary: Although the absolute risk of violence among persons with serious mental illnesses (SMI)
is small, young people experiencing early psychosis are a subgroup at highest violence risk. Violence is a
public health issue that contributes to health disparities experienced by adults with schizophrenia, including
caregiver burden, social isolation, and incarceration and subsequent early mortality. Cognitive behavioral
therapy (CBT) for psychosis and similar behavioral interventions have had efficacy in reducing impairment and
improving functioning among young adults with early psychosis. However, no identified studies have explored
using a behavioral intervention to reduce violence among young adults with early psychosis.
 In this application, Dr. Stephanie Rolin proposes a comprehensive path towards becoming an independent
physician investigator creating and adapting evidence-based approaches to assess and reduce violence risk.
Specifically, this proposal follows the CDC’s Map of Adaptation, a model for adapting evidence-based
interventions (EBI), to adapt and evaluate the feasibility of an early intervention services (EIS)-specific CBT-
based intervention to reduce violence with proposed targets consistent with the transdiagnostic nature of
Research Domain Criteria (RDoC). This research will occur at OnTrackNY, the largest EIS program in the
United States; OnTrackNY has provided evidence-based coordinated specialty care to over 1,800 individuals
at more than 20 clinics in New York State. First, Dr. Rolin will conduct individual semi-structured interviews with
EIS clients who have engaged in recent violent behavior (n=20) and clinicians who have worked with EIS
clients who have engaged in violent behavior (n=10). These interviews will use the Theory of Planned Behavior
to identify key areas of an existing CBT model called PICASSO (which has shown efficacy in reducing
violence) that require adaptation for the EIS setting. Next, Dr. Rolin will adapt the PICASSO model for the EIS
setting in an open pilot trial, through an iterative process that utilizes mixed methods assessment. Finally, Dr.
Rolin will evaluate the intervention’s feasibility through a pilot RCT.
 To further her long-term career goal of becoming an independent physician-investigator focused on creating
and adapting EBI to reduce violence risk, Dr Rolin will pursue training in the following four areas: (1) qualitative
research including mixed methods; (2) psychosocial intervention adaptation; (3) psychotherapy clinical trials;
and (4) grant writing. The product of this study will be an R01 of a large RCT to test the feasibility of the first
EBI of CBT to reduce violence in the EIS setting. Overall, this award will ensure Dr. Rolin’s successful
transition to an independent physician investigator studying the assessment and prevention of violence among
adults with SMI."
10922776,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Solitary pulmonary nodules (SPNs) are hazy opacities less than or equal to 3 cm in diameter that are
surrounded by aerated lung. The incidence of SPN in the United States is approximately 1.5 million per year. It
can be observed in both benign and malignant etiology, with differential diagnosis proving to be a challenge.
Currently, imaging-based diagnosis takes months or even years of surveillance to assess benignity/malignancy
with a moderate degree of accuracy. The periodic imaging examinations also increase the burden of
healthcare costs, delay relevant treatment, and may increase the risk of metastasis. In addition, there is no
consensus on optimal size threshold or methods for tissue sampling of SPN in clinical care due to multiplicity,
heterogeneity, spatial limitations, etc. In brief, molecular diagnostics for prompt, definitive detection of
malignant SPN is absent but highly desired. Liquid biopsy offers a method of precision diagnosis, yet it has not
been explored in SPN. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are cell released vesicles of sub-micrometer diameter. EVs
contain a tissue-specific signature wherein a variety of proteins and nucleic acids are selectively packaged.
Growing evidence has shown important biological roles and clinical relevance of EVs in cancers. Recently, our
preliminary study demonstrated that malignant SPNs can be identified by interrogating the molecules
contained within EVs, and it is probable that a definitive diagnosis can be made with a five-day turnaround time
after the initial visit. Consequently, in the pursuit of clinical translation, we propose the development of an
assay and mutation panel for liquid biopsy of SPN with EVs. This ultimate goal will be achieved by fulfilling
three major milestones. First, we will develop and validate a microdevice for efficient isolation of pure EVs from
up to 5 ml plasma for reliable downstream molecular analyses. The disposable device also features ready-to-
use, low-cost, automated, and high-throughput processing of various body fluids. Second, to strengthen the
coverage and depth of sequencing, we customized a mutation panel that consists of 565 genes that are
involved in lung adenocarcinoma. Meanwhile, the sequencing library preparation that uses EV DNA and
associated targeted sequencing will be optimized and validated. Third, we will analyze mutation concordance
between malignant SPN tissue DNA and plasma EV DNA. Based on identified mutations, mutation patterns in
relation to smoking history and sex in malignant SPN will be investigated. Genomic evolution of malignant
SPNs will be studied among malignant SPN tissue DNA, normal tissue DNA, and plasma EV DNA. In parallel,
we will customize a minimized gene panel for SPN differential diagnosis without compromising detection
sensitivity and specificity. Altogether, we aim to develop an assay for diagnosis of SPNs in clinical settings.
Moreover, mutations and genomic evolution of malignant SPNs will be studied. While designed to specifically
target SPNs as proof-of-concept, the new device in combination with other molecular detection modalities will
provide a transformative platform for basic and clinical investigation of a wide range of diseases."
10900692,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Our previous programs (2005-21) under this RFA supported trauma and injury research through long-
term training of 32 trainees at the Masters level (28 Pakistani and 4 Afghani nationals) and 3 in PhD
(Pakistanis). The program also supported short term training of over 6500 individuals. Building on this
existing research capacity at Aga Khan University (AKU), our collaborative team proposes to expand training
in trauma and injury research (TIR) to five other countries with AKU campuses and establish AKU as a
leader in TIR capacity building in low- and middle-income countries. Our history of collaboration between
AKU, JHU and George Washington University’s Milken Institute School of Public Health (GWSPH) is ripe
for a wider impact to support TIR. The larger mission of this new proposal is threefold: first, to support AKU,
Karachi, Pakistan as it takes leading role in training future leaders in TIR (Specific Aim 1); second, to expand
the training in AKU campuses across Central Asia and East Africa (Specific Aim 2); and third, to focus
research on the national and regional issues such as injuries and trauma caused by conflicts, disasters and
mass casualties (Specific Aim 3). This transformative approach means that we will expand our focus from
all injuries to injuries in the specific context of disasters, conflicts and wars, and from a single region focus
to a multi-national training model. The overall goal of this Aga Khan University Trauma and Injury
Research Training Program (AKU-TIRTP) is to strengthen research capacity on trauma and injuries
across AKU institutions in six countries from South Asia (Pakistan, Afghanistan), Central Asia (Kyrgyzstan
and Tajikistan) and East Africa (Tanzania, Kenya), and build a strong south-south and cross-regional model
of collaboration. Our model will focus on expanding doctoral training in Pakistan for professionals from East
Africa and Afghanistan, while building a large cadre of TIR professionals through a hybrid, short-term (online
and traditional face to face) training activities across all sites. The short-term training will not only elaborate
approaches to studying basic TIR but also provide a focus on injuries due to conflicts, disasters and mass
casualties. Through the research of doctoral trainees and small grants program open to larger audience,
we will promote development of evidence around conflicts/wars, disasters (both natural and man-made),
emergency care, and mass casualties – national priorities across all participating sites. In summary, we
propose a unique, large scale collaboration across regions which addresses critical and contextually
relevant research gaps in TIR with a focus on disaster and emergency care. This is possible largely because
of the truly global footprint of AKU; the growth, acceptability and robust infrastructure in distance learning;
and 15 years of collaborative work between AKU, JHU and GWSPH. We will leverage the resources at the
two leading US research institutions to guide and mentor AKU during this phase of growth and create a
global model of successful capacity development."

the cutting edge of research in pediatric gastroenterology. Trainees will be at the postdoctoral level and a mixture
of MDs and PhDs supported for up to 3 years for a total request of 5 stipends/yr. to accomplish these goals. For
all trainees, the program has traditionally placed strong emphasis on molecular biology, the rationale being that
molecular approaches are of central importance in both study and treatment of diseases associated with pediatric
gastroenterology. In the current proposal there also is emphasis on bringing the results of molecular research to
the bedside with opportunities for intense training in clinical research. The mentors (6 MDs, 5 MD/PhDs and 9
PhDs) represent a multidisciplinary group of experienced investigators from various departments at Baylor
College of Medicine (BCM), the University of Texas Health Science Center, and the Methodist Hospital Research
Center. Their research covers four broad areas important to pediatric gastroenterology, namely: mucosal biology,
molecular hepatology, immunology and microbiome, and clinical translational. All mentor laboratories are well
funded and well equipped. Faculty members have excellent track records of mentoring and interaction and
participation in our training program activities. The Program Director, Robert J. Shulman, MD maintains ultimate
authority for the program and manages day-to-day operations. He is assisted by an Associate Program Director
(Douglas G. Burrin, PhD for additional expertise in basic science research). Major administrative decisions (e.g.,
selection of trainees) are handled by an Executive Committee, which includes the Program Director, Associate
Director, four other program faculty, and a senior faculty member not associated with this grant. The training
program for MD fellows includes research rotations to facilitate selection of a mentor. Both MD and PhD trainees
have individual research committees, must prepare a written research proposal to be defended to the research
committee, and have semiannual reviews that include research progress and academic and career assessment.
Both MD and PhD fellows are required to attend a weekly gastroenterology/hepatology/nutrition pathophysiology
course, a bimonthly research seminar series, a monthly journal club, and a thrice yearly scientific social. All
trainees (MD and PhD) must present at these meetings. Trainees are selected from a highly competitive
applicant pool that already exists at BCM. Over the past 15 years, trainees have performed well, with over 82%
of MDs and PhDs remaining in academia and others in research positions (e.g., pharmaceutical); the majority
has been successful in securing funding for their research including R01, K08, K01, K23, R03, R21, F32 grants,
as well as from other competitive sources. The current proposal includes several new features designed to enrich
and enhance the existing program based, in part, on recommendations by our external advisory committee and
surveys of graduates from the training program. A new Division Chief of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology,
and Nutrition with outstanding academic credentials adds additional strength."
10916273,"Project Summary/Abstract
Kaposi sarcoma (KS) remains one of the most common malignancies in people living with HIV/AIDS worldwide.
Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV), also called human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8), is the causal agent for KS. The
oral mucosa is the first target of KSHV infection once the virus is in the oral cavity. However, the initial infection
process of the mucosa by KSHV has never been studied, mainly due to lack of an in vitro model to recapitulate
the viral infection in vivo and nonexistence of an animal model for KSHV infection. We have created the 3-
dimentional (3-D) organotypic culture as an oral mucosal mimic resembling a stratified oral mucosa with the
potential for histological assessment of the KSHV infection/transmission process. Our studies show that KSHV
infection in the 3-D oral mucosa model is enhanced by saliva extracellular vesicles (EVs), particularly exosomes,
from HIV patients. Exosomes purified from the saliva of HIV patients or from culture media of HIV-infected T
cells contain similar HIV-specific cargos, including HIV TAR RNA. KSHV entry into target cells and its infectivity
are increased by HIV-positive saliva exosomes in primary and immortalized human oral epithelial cells. Further,
KSHV infection and transmission to the suprabasal cells in the 3-D organotypic culture are enhanced by HIV-
positive exosomes. Increased KSHV infectivity by HIV-positive exosomes is attributed to the HIV TAR RNA within
the vesicles and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) of host cells. Inhibition of EGFR by Cetuximab, a
monoclonal antibody to EGFR, blocks KSHV infection enhanced by HIV-positive exosomes. Taken together,
these data lead us to hypothesize that HIV-positive exosomes promote KSHV infection and transmission through
the oral route and are responsible for increased incidence of KSHV infection in people living with HIV. To test
this hypothesis, we plan to 1) assess KSHV transmission and infection through the oral route with the 3-D
cultures of oral mucosal and tonsil tissues incorporated with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as
well as the epithelium-endothelium model. KSHV infection and transmission through the epithelial barrier to
immune and endothelial cells in response to HIV+ saliva exosomes will be assessed; 2) delineate the mechanism
by which HIV-positive exosomes promote KSHV oral transmission using the 3-D tissue models. We will apply
single cell RNAseq to identify cell-specific changes in transcriptome of the oral mucosal and tonsil 3-D tissue
models following KSHV infection in response to HIV+ exosomes; and 3) elucidate the role of EGFR-dependent
mitogen-activated protein kinase activation in enhanced KSHV transmission by HIV-positive exosomes. Success
of the proposed research will advance our understanding of KSHV oral transmission at the molecular level and
the underlying mechanisms for developing potential novel therapeutic strategies."
10895600,"ADMINISTRATIVE CORE - PROJECT SUMMARY
This Buck Institute Tissue Mapping Center (TMC) grant application proposes to map senescent cells in three
human somatic and reproductive tissues, i.e., ovaries, breast tissue, and skeletal muscle. It is crucial to provide
tissue maps of cellular senescence as well as a SASP Atlas of for these human tissues as (i) ovaries are one of
the first tissues to age, (ii) breast tissue has been shown to rapidly age and display high SASP gene expression
signatures in previous RNA Seq experiments, and (iii) muscle aging typically leads to impacted mobility or frailty.
The Admin core will oversee a leadership plan, a tissue-mapping coordination plan and a network coordination
plan to generate senescence tissue maps as part of the SenNet Consortium. The Admin Core will oversee that
data sharing pipelines within the TMC and with the SenNet network will be implemented and improved. The
collaboration between the Admin Core with the 3 other scientific Buck Institute TMC cores, the Biospecimen
Core, Biological Analysis Core and Data Analysis Core, will enable a streamlined tissue collection, data
acquisition and data analysis pipeline, in order to generate and prioritize senescence biomarkers expressed in
the somatic and reproductive tissues. Regular discussions and meetings between the Admin Core leaders and
leaders of the other scientific cores will allow efficient information exchange between all stakeholders. The
Admin Core in collaboration with the Data Analysis Core will develop and implement plans for submission of
data, protocols and resources to the SenNet Consortium and its data coordination center. The Admin Core will
ensure that any data submitted to the consortium complies with network-wide standard operating procedures
and SenNet policies. Collaborations with other TMC centers will enable comparisons of senescence markers
between tissues, and applying different technologies that are available at different TMC centers for tissue
mapping of multiple tissues, as the Admin Center will encourage all TMC centers to work together and to engage
in cross-training of technological skill-sets, use of novel instrumentations for scientists between centers, and
expanding intellectual knowledge about cellular senescence. Throughout the award period novel technological
advancements will be implemented more broadly into TMC workflows and tissue biological analysis pipelines as
they become available for network use. The Admin Core will coordinate such implementation in collaboration
with other Technology Development Centers and other TMC centers.
In summary, the Admin Core will coordinate all efforts of the TMC and build upon the existing strong scientific
expertise in cellular senescence research at the Buck Institute to establish a new Senescence Tissue Mapping
Atlas resource focusing on human ovaries, breast tissue, and skeletal muscle."
10895603,"BIOSPECIMEN CORE - PROJECT SUMMARY
Senescent cells play a role in development and disease. Because the cumulative exposure to senescence
stimuli increases with time, senescent cells accumulate in aging tissues. Although senescent cells may be
protective, they can also fuel aging and pathologic conditions through gene expression changes and acquisition
of a Senescence Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP). The SASP consists of altered secretion of cytokines,
chemokines, growth factors, and proteases, which can cause chronic sterile inflammation and alter surrounding
tissue structure and function. The overarching goal of our Tissue Mapping Center, via the coordinated efforts of
the Administrative, Biospecimen, Biological Analysis, and Data Analysis Cores, is to generate a blueprint of
cellular senescence using morphometric, proteomic and transcriptomic approaches at single cell resolution in
three healthy human tissues: the ovary, breast, and skeletal muscle. The SASP will be interrogated in follicular
fluid, the associated ovarian biofluid, through advanced proteomics. Moreover, we will evaluate the systemic
SASP in matched urine and plasma samples. To this end, the Biospecimen Core will partner with Northwestern
University, the Komen Tissue Bank, and Wake Forest University for the retrospective and prospective collection
of tissues, matched fluids, and associated demographic and clinical data from consenting adults via IRB-
approved protocols and procedures. Samples will include: ovarian tissue (N=50, 42-78y), follicular fluid (N=50,
27-45y), breast biopsies (N=66, 29-66y), and skeletal muscle biopsies (N=88, balanced for young (20-30y) and
old (>70y) ages). Importantly, vastus lateralis (VL) muscle biopsies will be collected longitudinally 3 years apart
from healthy males and females, and D3 creatine urine measurements will be used to correlate cellular
senescence signatures with total body muscle mass. The Biospecimen Core will procure, curate, validate, and
distribute tissues to the Biological Analysis Core and other SenNet Tissue Mapping Centers. Mapping senescent
cells in ovary, breast, and muscle will provide the first insights into cellular senescence differences between
reproductive and somatic tissues and will elucidate ubiquitous and tissue-specific signatures of cellular
senescence. Moreover, these three tissues are relevant to aging because: 1) the ovary ages first in the human
body and is associated with a fibro-inflammatory microenvironment, 2) the breast exhibits a strong SASP with
aging and has a high fat content which often exhibits cellular senescence, and 3) skeletal muscle deterioration
is associated with sarcopenia, the most common cause of age-related frailty, with the vastus lateralis being one
of the first tissues affecting physical performance. The muscle biopsies will be obtained longitudinally, with the
interval between repeated biopsies being the longest yet attempted in molecular studies on human aging in
muscle in both sexes. Thus, we are well positioned to reveal the burden of cellular senescence across the
lifespan in an unprecedented manner."
10895604,"DATA ANALYSIS CORE - PROJECT SUMMARY
Senescent cells (SCs) are long-lived inflammatory cells that ensue from the exposure to certain cellular
stressors. These cells have been found to increase with aging and in many age-related chronic diseases and
some studies have mechanistically linked SC function with a variety of disease phenotypes. New therapies
targetingSCs (senolytics) can act by transiently disabling anti-apoptotic networks on SCs and causing apoptosis
of those SCs within a tissue. In animal models, senolytics can delay, prevent or improve frailty,
cardiovascular pathology, neuropsychiatric conditions and liver, kidney, musculoskeletal, lung, eye,
haematological, metabolic and skin disorders, among other clinical phenotypes. Current methods to
quantify SC burden in tissues rely on a few canonical markers such as p16, p21, SA-βgal, etc. but their
specificity is still debatable and these markers are seldom co-expressed in human tissues. Thus, at present, we
lack a complete picture of the estimated SC burden across tissues in humans in health and during
aging. Here, we aim to unbiasedly characterize SCs from different human tissues using different technological
platforms and advanced analytics to develop at Atlas of SCs in human tissues. Since the accumulation of SCs
is thought to precede disease phenotypes, robust diagnostic methods to identify SCs will also enable early
detection of those at risk for developing chronic disease. Without robust diagnostics to estimate SC burden in
human tissues, (1) assessment of therapies targeting SCs will continue to be a bottleneck in senolytic drug
development and (2) chronic disease will continue to be a growing public health concern which will lead to a
steady reduction in the populations' health span. In this proposal, we will construct molecular and
morphological maps for tissue-resident SCs in humans and create multiple mechanisms to share these
results with the scientific community. The Data Analysis Core of the Tissue Mapping Center will harness its
ability to unbiasedly profile human tissues and blood to predict the senescent cell burden in humans and create
an Atlas of SC biomarkers in tissues. To achieve our goals, our Data Analysis Core will provide pipelines for
data processing, algorithms for data analysis, construct and share a map of human SCs in tissues, and general
coordination of data through the Consortium Organization and Data Coordination Center (CODCC) and with
Cellular Senescence Network (SenNet). We will build, curate, and annotate a SCs atlas across human tissues
and implement data sharing and coordinate protocols and analytic pipelines with SenNet. The database will
allow users to view and download SCs signatures, and provide a controlled access system for de-identified
individual-level single nuclei expression, imaging and proteomic data. This resource will also serve for many
additional kinds of analyses throughout the consortium."
10895605,"BIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS CORE - PROJECT SUMMARY
This Buck Institute Tissue Mapping Center (TMC) proposes to map senescent cells in three human somatic and
reproductive tissues; ovaries, breast tissue and skeletal muscle. A major gap in the field has been to define
specific cellular senescence markers for distinct cells and tissue types. We propose to fill this gap by defining
markers of cellular senescence in the context of aging in human tissues. The capabilities of this core include a
deep knowledge of multiple aspects of senescence encompassing the SASP, novel senolytics, and preliminary
data defining senescent cells in human muscle tissue. Tissues received in the Biospecimen Core will be
conveyed to the Biological Analysis Core and subjected to multiple procedures designed to identify senescent
cell signatures (either protein or mRNA) in nuclei or biofluids, and confirmed in tissue sections. The results from
the Biological Analysis Core will be conveyed to the Data Analysis Core, and coordinated through the
Administrative Core. The Biological Analysis Core will spatially map and determine the signatures of cellular
senescence in healthy human ovaries, breast, and muscle in both sexes across an aging continuum through
four specific aims. 1) Determine the unique transcriptional signature of large senescent cells. We will determine
the transcriptional signatures of large senescent cells, which are lost during conventional single cell workflows
and use this data to determine the prevalence of such signatures in the breast, ovary, and muscle. 2) Determine
senescent protein signatures of the breast, ovary, and skeletal muscle. We will comprehensively analyze
secreted senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) proteins from bio fluids, and cell culture
systems from muscle, breast, and ovaries using different senescence inducers and senolytics. 3) Determine
senescent transcriptional signatures of the breast, ovary, and skeletal muscle. We will use a bootstrapping
strategy on key cell types from the tissues in this aim, to determine unique single cell senescent signatures

10974464,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
6.2M Americans over the age of 65 suffer from Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and this number expected to double in
~30 years. AD is characterized by aphasia, loss of fine and gross motor function, and rapid cognitive decline.
The widely favored “amyloid hypothesis” of AD posits that accumulation of fibrillar amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques in
the brain parenchyma drives AD pathogenesis. However, the amyloid pathway has proven to be an ineffective
therapeutic target in numerous clinical trials and AD remains clinically intractable, highlighting the urgent need
for deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms of disease. Our lab previously reported that
mitochondrial calcium (mCa2+) overload promotes AD pathogenesis. mCa2+ homeostasis is maintained through
regulation of mCa2+ uptake through the mitochondrial calcium uniporter channel (mtCU) and mCa2+ efflux through
the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCLX). Human cortex from sporadic AD patients demonstrates >70%
reduction in NCLX expression. Genetic rescue of mCa2+ efflux via hippocampal neuron-specific expression of
NCLX protects against mCa2+ overload, ROS-stress, Aβ and tau deposition, and cognitive decline in AD mutant
mice. We interpret remodeling of mCa2+ transport as a compensatory response to an early pathologic stress (e.g.,
energetic crisis, aging, genetic predisposition) to increase ATP bioavailability. Over time, this response turns
maladaptive and promotes pathologic mCa2+ overload. mCa2+ overload causes excessive production of reactive
oxygen species (ROS), metabolic derangement, and cell death, all hallmarks of AD. Although a robust
connection between neuronal mCa2+ overload and AD pathogenesis has been established, how altered regulation
of mCa2+ uptake promotes or protects against AD pathology remains completely unexplored. Our preliminary
data demonstrates MICU3 expression is significantly reduced by ~50% in multiple cortical regions of samples
isolated from sporadic AD patients. Further, MICU3 expression is reduced >90% in the cortex of 1 year-old.
3xTg-AD mutant mice. This proposal hypothesizes that loss of neuronal Micu3 contributes to aberrant
mtCU-mediated mCa2+ uptake, resulting in mCa2+ overload, metabolic derangement, neuronal dysfunction,
and cognitive decline in AD. To address this hypothesis we will utilize newly generated neuron-specific MICU3
knockout mouse lines to measure if knockout of MICU3 alone is sufficient to cause neurodegeneration.
Subsequently, we will use our newly developed cre-inducible MICU3 overexpression mouse line to see if
rescuing MICU3 levels shortly after onset of cognitive decline in the APPNL-G-F mouse model of AD is sufficient
to mitigate or reverse AD pathology. These studies will be followed up with a series of mechanistic in vitro studies
to determine the molecular mechanism of MICU3-mediated neuronal dysfunction in AD. The role of MICU3 in
physiology and disease states, including AD, is unknown; coupled with our findings that altered mCa2+ handling
is a pathologic feature of and promising therapeutic target for AD provides strong rationale for this proposal."

Faithful development and maintenance of individual cell types in the heart, lungs, and blood (HLB) are
dependent upon cell type-specific decoding of the genome. These cell type-specific transcriptional programs
are the result of the coordinated actions of many transcription factors (TFs), which regulate transcriptional
output in a temporal and locus specific fashion. Due to their central role in HLB biology, a comprehensive
molecular understanding of TF function would reveal the contribution of TFs to maintaining homeostasis, as
well as inform how disruption of this balance can lead to the progression of HLB disorders. While methods to
understand how TFs regulate gene expression exist, we lack methods and analytical tools to assay how TFs
themselves are regulated post-translationally. By narrowly focusing on well-known phenotypes (DNA-binding)
with well-developed methods (CHIP-seq, CUT&Tag), we fail to capture biological information at other
regulatory levels, such as the post-translational control of TF degradation by E3 ubiquitin ligases. Importantly,
this failure is not one of interest, but rather stems from the dearth of facile, scalable methods to study
post-translation regulation of TFs.
To address this critical shortcoming, I will develop a novel assay capable of measuring the effect of genetic
perturbations on TF protein abundance at a scale that is not possible with current methods (Aim 1). I will
initially apply this method to a library of 127 TFs previously demonstrated to have tissue specific expression in
heart, lung, blood, bone marrow, or lymph node 1, and then subsequently scale the method to study the effect of
genetic perturbation on 2000 TFs to comprehensively discover E3 ubiquitin ligases that regulate TF
abundance. (Aim 2). Finally, I will map the minimal peptides necessary for observed changes in protein levels
(Aim 3). This study will provide a target-linked map of E3-TF pairs, and lead to a broader understanding of the
factors controlling transcription factor protein levels. Further, we will gain insights into the role of
post-translational TF regulation in homeostasis as well as the mechanisms by which this homeostasis
becomes dysregulated. Importantly, the E3-TF pairs discovered in this project will be of interest as therapeutic
targets, with each pair representing a novel protein-protein interaction to target for stabilization or ablation.
As a part of the fellowship, I will also undergo a training plan aimed at expanding my abilities as an
experimental biologist as well as improving my knowledge of computational methods and statistics. The
research and training plan will be performed in collaboration with my sponsor and co-sponsor, Dr. Jay
Shendure and Dr. Ning Zheng, both at the University of Washington. My advisors were specifically chosen
because they each have outstanding records of performing cutting edge research and training the next
generation of scientific thought leaders."
10914157,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Myelin has evolved to speed up, finely tune, and increase the metabolic efficiency of electrical signal transmission
in the brain. In numerous human diseases however, myelin degenerates, ultimately resulting in devastating
motor and cognitive impairment. Importantly, in order for tissue repair to proceed after myelin damage has
occurred, the many layers of compacted cell membrane that constitute the myelin sheath must be rapidly and
efficiently removed by resident phagocytic cells in the brain. Defective removal of these debris has been
implicated in a number of degenerative conditions, including but not limited to, multiple sclerosis and aging, yet
we know little about the cellular dynamics and molecular mechanisms governing these processes. In order to
study these critical cellular events and answer questions centered on which cell populations are involved and
what roles these different cell types play, we have developed advanced techniques for imaging and manipulating
these discrete events in the live animal over a wide range of temporal scales from seconds to months. These
techniques include intravital imaging of new combinations of fluorophore-based multicolor transgenic labels of
distinct populations of neurons and glia together with label-free imaging modalities specific for compact myelin.
In addition to these powerful labeling and optical imaging strategies, we have also developed a new technique
for targeted induction of single-cell death, which we have recently established as a model of on-demand and
titratable demyelination in the mouse cortical gray matter. Combining these techniques now allows dynamic
investigation of demyelination and remyelination in the context of targeted genetic manipulations and animal
models of human disease. Using these powerful tools this project will investigate three central aims. First, there
is increasing evidence that in addition to microglia, the primary phagocytes of the brain, other resident glial cell
types, namely astrocytes and NG2 glia, are also involved and play important roles in the phagocytosis and repair
process. We will determine the precise contribution of each glial cell type in the dynamic detection and clearance
of degenerating myelin debris. Next, we and others have shown the importance of phosphatidylserine receptors
in the efficient detection and clearance of dying neurons and other cells in different organs. We will determine
the role and consequences of both defective phagocytic receptors and debris digestion signaling on the dynamic
response by NG2 glia to cortical demyelination and the resulting remyelination success and myelin patterning.
Finally, there is evidence that neuronal activity and/or sensory experience can modify remyelination, but less is
known about the roles of neuronal activity on phagocytic function in the context of demyelination. We will
determine the consequences of bidirectional neuronal activity changes on the response by phagocytic cells to
single-cell demyelination. Ultimately, these studies will reveal which cells are involved in myelin debris clearance,
the role of major cell debris recognition pathways in successful clearance and repair, and how neuronal activity
and sensory experience modify the response of phagocytic glia to a demyelinating event."
10898570,"ABSTRACT/PROJECT SUMMARY
Good vascular health is important for the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD), a highly
prevalent disease in the US, with post-menopausal women at an especially high risk. Dietary intake is a major
driver of vascular health, and diet can affect vascular health in part through actions involving the gut microbiome.
Specifically, choline can be converted to trimethylamine, a precursor to trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) which
is a metabolite shown to have atherosclerotic effects. This reaction is dependent on bacteria in the gut
microbiome. Studies of this metabolic pathway have examined individual foods rich in choline (i.e., red meat,
fish, and eggs), however, the effect of an overall dietary pattern on this pathway has been understudied. We
have created a novel dietary pattern predictive of biomarkers of TMAO production (the TMAO dietary pattern)
within an ancillary study sample of the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) Observational Study, a prospective
cohort study of post-menopausal women. Applying the TMAO dietary pattern to examine how it is associated
with the intermediates of the pathway of TMAO production and a measure of vascular health is critical to gain a
more complete understanding of the influence of overall dietary intake on this metabolic process. Examining an
individual’s vasculature typically requires invasive procedures, however, measuring the retinal vessel caliber is
a noninvasive way to assess an individual’s vascular health at the microvascular level. The purpose of this
proposal is to examine how adherence to the TMAO dietary pattern is associated with 1) a broad array of
circulating plasma metabolite concentrations, 2) the composition and diversity of the gut microbiome, and 3)
retinal vessel caliber measured several years after dietary assessment using data from separate ancillary study
samples of the WHI. We hypothesize that higher adherence to the TMAO dietary pattern will be associated with
less favorable (e.g., pro-atherogenic) metabolomic profiles, gut microbiome composition, and retinal vessel
caliber measures compared to lower adherence. Data are already collected and available on metabolomic
profiles (>300 metabolites) of plasma samples measured using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry
methods and on the gut microbiome composition assessed using 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequencing of
DNA extracted from stool samples, with habitual dietary intake assessed at the same time points. Additionally,
digital color photographs have already been graded for retinal vessel caliber. We expect findings from this
research to provide implications for future interventions targeting the diet and gut microbiome for vascular-related
disease prevention. Ultimately, based on our findings, dietary guidelines for the prevention of atherosclerotic
CVD may be enhanced. This study will facilitate my proposed training plan by allowing me to gain a deeper
understanding of the underlying metabolic process of TMAO production and its influence on vascular health. My
training plan includes a multidisciplinary team which will allow me to gain skills in nutrition and biological research
using quantitative and epidemiologic methods, while progressing my career as an independent researcher."
10852834,"Abstract: More than 200 million individuals are at risk for chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) each year.
CTE is strongly associated with exposure to repetitive head impacts (RHI) such as those received through
contact sports and military activities. Neuropathologically, CTE is defined by progressive accumulation of
hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) which is potentiated by microglial neuroinflammation. RHI exposure can induce
microglial inflammation even before the onset of tau pathology, but the mechanisms connecting RHI,
inflammation, and tau in CTE are unknown, representing a major knowledge gap. Proper lysosomal function in
microglia is a key mechanism of p-tau clearance that, when impaired, contributes to p-tau deposition. Recently,
a genetic risk factor for more severe tau pathology in CTE, TMEM106b, was found to influence microglial
inflammation, tau pathology, and CTE severity. TMEM106b is a lysosome-associated protein and the risk allele
produces larger, poorly acidifying lysosomes, pointing to a potential role for lysosomal processing in CTE
pathogenesis. Furthermore, preliminary single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) data from CTE tissue also
suggest an alteration to lysosomal functions in microglia. These data led us to hypothesize that exposure to RHI
triggers persistent microglial lysosomal dysfunction which is exacerbated by TMEM106b genetic risk allele and
drives p-tau deposition in CTE. To address this hypothesis, we will utilize snRNAseq, spatial transcriptomics,
and multiplex immunofluorescence to tease apart the genetic underpinnings of RHI-induced microglial lysosomal
dysfunction and understand its role as a potential mechanism conferring TMEM106b genetic risk for more severe
p-tau pathology in CTE. In Aim 1 we will assess cellularly and spatially resolved genomic changes to microglial
transcripts in individuals with CTE. This will reveal the genomic underpinnings of lysosomal dysfunction following
RHI and allow us to localize these changes to regions of p-tau deposition. In Aim 2 we will examine microglial
lysosomal structure and content, markers of lysosomal function, stress, and protease expression. We will then
analyze the relationship of these changes to TMEM106b allele status, years of RHI exposure, and presence and
severity of CTE pathology. Previous work in the McKee and Cherry Labs (Sponsor and co-sponsor) and
preliminary data have validated the proposed techniques. This work will be the first to study microglial lysosomal
dysfunction as a mechanism of CTE pathology and genetic risk which will significantly advance or understanding
of an early disease process and direct future discovery of novel biomarkers and therapeutically targetable
mechanisms."

Congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV) infection is the leading infectious cause of birth defects and brain damage
worldwide, leaving >5,000 infants with permanent disabilities each year in the U.S. alone, with a
disproportionate proportion in minority populations. While a vaccine to prevent cCMV has been labeled “tier 1
priority” for over 20 years, we remain without a licensed vaccine product, in part due to limited understanding of
the types of immune responses that are protective against placental CMV transmission. Primary infection
during pregnancy is high risk for cCMV transmission, yet only approximately a third of mothers acutely-infected
during pregnancy will transmit the virus to their infants, suggesting that the rapidity and magnitude of the
maternal immune responses plays a role in protection against placental virus transmission. The overarching
goal of this proposal is to define CMV-specific humoral and cellular immune responses associated with
reduced risk of fetal transmission and model their impact on placental transmission. To address this goal, we
have access to a unique cohort of 399 acutely CMV-infected transmitting and non-transmitting pregnant
women enrolled in the NIH National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Maternal Fetal
Medicine Unit (MFMU) CMV hyperimmunoglobulin trial (NCT01376778). This trial was a double-blind
randomized trial that screened >100,000 pregnant women for acute CMV infection for enrollment to receive
either CMV hyperimmunoglobulin (HIG) or placebo, yet was stopped for futility, creating a unique opportunity to
define the acute cellular and humoral immune responses that are associated with transmission risk since HIG
infusion after seroconversion did not change transmission risk. Our hypothesis is that the combination of
early, functional CMV-specific IgG responses and CD4+ T cell and specialized innate immune cell responses
to primary CMV infection during pregnancy will predict reduced risk of fetal transmission and disease. The
combined strength of this uniquely large acutely CMV-infected pregnant cohort, our expertise in measuring
CMV-specific humoral and cellular immune responses, and expertise in novel mathematical and placental
organoid models will inform immune targets of CMV vaccine development that will be predicted to reduce the
risk of cCMV transmission. Our Specific Aims include: 1) Define the CMV-specific IgG binding and functional
responses associated with reduced transmission and disease following primary CMV infection in pregnancy; 2)
Define the cellular immune responses elicited during primary CMV infection that associate with reduced
transmission in pregnancy; 3) Develop an in silico model that can predict candidate CMV vaccine efficacy for
prevention of placental transmission based on maternal immune correlates of cCMV transmission and the rate
of viral spread in placental organoid models. Defining immune targets that will reduce fetal transmission and
infant disease following primary maternal CMV infection will speed the design of effective vaccines to
drastically decrease neurologic impairment and long-term disabilities in children worldwide."
10893641,"Project Summary/Abstract
Phosphorylation of histidine (His) in proteins has a 60-year history, initially identified as a P-enzyme
intermediate, but subsequently as a regulatory mechanism in bacteria essential for signal transduction by
surface receptors that sense nutrients. Such signaling systems are lacking in mammals, but phosphohistidine
(pHis) is not only a key P-enzyme intermediate in mammalian enzymes (e.g. NME1/2, ACLY), but also occurs
as a reversible end-state protein modification, e.g. pHis18 in histone H4. His phosphorylation is labile to acid
and heat making it challenging to study, and to circumvent this our group developed a series of monoclonal
antibodies (mAbs) that recognize the 1-pHis or 3-pHis isoforms in a sequence-independent manner. These
mAbs were used to detect pHis in cells by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence (IF) staining, and for
affinity enrichment of pHis proteins for MS analysis, revealing ~700 potential pHis proteins and implying the
existence of large “hidden” phosphoproteome not detectable by conventional methods. In a collaborative study,
these mAbs were used to demonstrate site and isoform specific His phosphorylation of the KCa3.1 K+ channel
and deduce how pHis triggers channel opening. In a second collaborative study, the mAbs were used to
demonstrate increased levels of pHis proteins in mouse and human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and
show that the increase was due to reduced expression of the LHPP pHis phosphatase in the tumors,
suggesting that LHPP acts as a tumor suppressor, and that elevated His phosphorylation plays a driver role in
this cancer. On this basis, studies are planned to investigate whether increased His phosphorylation plays a
broader role in human cancer. Initially, our structures of mAb-derived Fab fragments bound to pHis peptides
will be exploited to develop better tools for studying His phosphorylation in cancer - mAbs with higher affinity
and scFvs for intracellular expression to localize and perturb pHis proteins, sequence specific pHis antibodies
for studying individual proteins, and improved MS-based pHis site identification. In parallel, in-depth studies
with existing 1/3-pHis mAbs, as well as new pHis reagents as they come online, will be conducted on three
selected tumor types - HCC, pediatric neuroblastoma and pancreatic cancer, where there is evidence that
aberrant His phosphorylation may play a role. Immunoblotting, and IF and IHC staining will be performed on
tumor tissues/cell lines and normal controls, combined with use of optimized pHis peptide enrichment and site
identification protocols to define changes in His phosphorylation unique to tumor tissues. Where warranted, the
function of individual pHis sites in cancer will be studied by site-directed mutagenesis in tumor cell lines. In
each case, further experiments will be guided by the identity and function of pHis proteins found in a particular
cancer. Overall, it is anticipated that comparative studies on HCC, neuroblastoma and PDAC will shed light on
whether His phosphorylation plays a general role in cancers, whether there are common mechanisms, and
whether targeting His phosphorylation could be a viable new therapeutic approach."
10902030,"Project Summary
The long-term goal of this project is to define molecular mechanisms that govern the long distance transfer of
protein-based signals in axons. Retrograde (axon-to-soma) signals are critical to activate transcriptional
programs both during neurodevelopment and following nerve injury, while continuous anterograde (soma-to-
axon) supply of `axon survival factors' is essential to maintain distal axon integrity. We and others have found
that key proteins that convey these retrograde and anterograde signals are modified with the lipid palmitate,
which facilitates their trafficking on axonal vesicles. In particular, experiments in the first cycle of funding
revealed that retrograde signaling by Dual Leucine-zipper Kinase (DLK, an upstream activator (a `MAP3K') of
Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathways) critically requires palmitoylation. We now hypothesize
that palmitoylation more broadly controls several distinct aspects of axonal signaling. The first Aim will focus on
palmitoylation of JNK family MAPKs, which are key `effector' kinases downstream of DLK and other MAP3Ks.
We will determine whether palmitoylation of the neural-specific JNK3 is required for Wallerian degeneration of
distal axons, and whether JNK3 phosphorylates palmitoylated axon survival factors, triggering their
degradation via a novel phospho-dependent mechanism. Aim 2 will focus on Rap2, a novel palmitoylated
regulator that lies upstream of DLK, and will determine whether Rap2 and its palmitoylation are broadly
required for DLK-dependent retrograde signaling. Aim 3 will assess whether the unique reversibility of
palmitoylation, compared with other protein-lipid modifications, is used to facilitate `sushi belt transport'
whereby the key axon survival factor NMNAT2 undergoes palmitoylation-dependent anterograde trafficking on
vesicles and is then locally depalmitoylated to increase its enzymatic and axo-protective activity. The proposed
research will define new cellular and molecular roles for palmitoylation in axonal protein trafficking and
signaling and will provide key insights into how responses to axonal damage are coordinated and controlled.
Results of our study may also reveal broader principles of axonal protein transport and signaling, in turn
increasing our understanding of a range of neurodegenerative disorders in which these processes are
impaired."
10835890,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Reconstruction of peripheral nerve gap injuries continues to pose a challenge in the clinic due to their
significant long-term functional morbidity. Multiple surgical approaches have been developed to promote
nerve regeneration across a damaged nerve with a gap. In the clinic, nerve autografts are considered the
standard of care in treating nerve gaps due to their superior capacity in promoting nerve regeneration.
However, the use of nerve autografts is limited by their availability, increased surgery time, loss of nerve
function from the lost nerve and donor site morbidity. Acellular nerve allografts (ANAs) have been proposed
as a clinical alternative to autografts in repairing nerve gaps due to their capability in promoting regeneration
across short gaps (< 3 cm). ANAs are allogenic nerves that are chemically processed to remove the cells,
reducing immunogenicity, while maintaining the extracellular matrix (ECM) that will allow cell migration into
the ANA and subsequent nerve regeneration. However, unlike autografts, ANAs do not support regeneration
across long defects (> 3 cm). The reason why long ANAs do not promote regeneration or regenerate poorly
is not completely understood. Previous studies have demonstrated the critical role of inflammatory cells,
such as macrophages and T cells, in regulating and promoting the early stages of nerve regeneration in
ANAs (before 4 weeks post-surgery). Specifically, macrophages will promote angiogenesis and T cells will
promote axonal myelination. However, when compared to short ANAs capable of robust regeneration,
preliminary data shows an increase in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and changes in the
morphology of blood vessels in long ANAs at the later stages of nerve regeneration (between 4- and 8-
weeks post-surgery). The increase in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the changes in the
morphology of blood vessels happen after angiogenesis has occurred and axons have started migrating into
the ANAs. These changes suggest that a pro-inflammatory environment develops inside long ANAs in the
later stages of nerve regeneration, and this correlates with changes in the morphology of blood vessels and
a decrease in the number of myelinated axons. We hypothesize the state of chronic inflammation in long
ANAs is disrupting the regenerative microenvironment in long ANAs. In brief, the proposed research aims
to characterize and compare the inflammatory microenvironment that develops in the later stages of nerve
regeneration in long ANAs with the microenvironment in the regenerated short ANAs and autografts. This
project also explores the effect of reducing inflammation in long ANAs, using a pharmacological intervention,
on axonal regeneration. An integral part of this study is to identify the cell subpopulations promoting the pro-
inflammatory microenvironment in long ANAs. An in-depth analysis of these cell subpopulations may provide
specific molecular targets used to develop therapies aimed to promote nerve regeneration in long ANAs."
10913464,"Project/Summary: Rural lung cancer survival rates have lagged behind the national average for decades. A key
contributor to recent survival disparities is fragmented survivorship care, leaving rural survivors without supports
to facilitate survivorship care and adherence to follow-up care. Rural survivors often receive their care from
specialists located in distal, urban centers, where travel, social, and financial burdens threaten adherence to
follow-up care. Further, urban healthcare professionals are unaware of rural resources and encumbered by
finding rural community resources needed to overcome barriers to care. Thus, a community-clinical survivorship
care team is a promising strategy to improve timely follow-up care and provide linkages to community resources.
A rural community health worker (CHW) that is knowledgeable about local resources and the socio-economic
barriers to survivorship care is a fitting community agent on a community-clinical team. The success of
community-clinical care teams to improve care coordination and health outcomes is well documented, but few
of these studies investigate rural survivorship care or the integration of a CHW in the team model. Also, a gap in
the literature exists regarding the implementation of a CHW-clinical survivorship care team model to improve
rural survivorship outcomes. To address this critical gap, the research examines the implementation of a CHW-
clinical survivorship care team to improve adherence to follow-up care for rural lung cancer survivors. The aims
of this project are to 1) assess perspectives on desired CHW roles and their processes for interacting with clinical
care team members in a community-clinical survivorship care team; 2) test the feasibility and initial acceptability
of CENTRAL, and 3) evaluate the implementation of CENTRAL to identify factors that influence its sustained
use in a multi-site effectiveness-implementation trial design R01. CENTRAL will be adapted from an existing
patient navigation research program, and interviews with key stakeholders to inform CHW roles and processes
for working with clinical care teams (Aim 1). Dr. Lewis-Thames will pilot CENTRAL (N=60) with rural lung cancer
survivors to assess its acceptability and feasibility (Aim 2). Aim 3 will provide insights on facilitators and barriers
of implementing CENTRAL via the EPIS (exploration, preparation, implementation, sustainment) implementation
framework through an analysis of implementation costs and interviews with CENTRAL participants, CHWs and
providers. This K01 involves a training plan consisting of coursework, seminars, experiential learning, and
mentorship by an established team of experts. The research is conducted at Northwestern University and
affiliated rural-serving Cancer Centers which offer superior facilities and resources to provide training in
intervention development and adaption, implementation science, cost-analysis, and rural survivorship care. The
outlined training plan will enable Dr. Lewis-Thames to accomplish her long-term career goal to become an
independent cancer disparities implementation. The proposed project is relevant to the NCI's Division of Cancer
Control and Population Science research emphasis on rural cancer control and health disparities."

Senescence is a complex phenotype that likely consists of many states that have been implicated in human
health and disease. We aim to create the Washington University Senescence Tissue Mapping Center (WU-
SN-TMC), which will leverage our expansive infrastructure to generate multi-omics and imaging data to build
high resolution, multi-dimensional atlases of cellular senescence across tissue types and lifespan that can be
used to enable basic and translational senescence research. Our WU-SN-TMC will develop cellular
senescence atlases using 500 human samples for four essential tissue types: bone marrow, breast, colon,
and liver. To tackle such an ambitious goal, the WU-SN-TMC Biospecimen Core (WU-SN-TMC BC) has been
designed to facilitate the collection of human tissues across a wide range of ages. In addition, the WU-SN-
TMC BC will collect multiple tissues from individuals to allow us to compare senescent numbers and states
across tissues from a single individual. The WU-SN-TMC BC will accomplish this goal by using sample
acquisition pipelines that are divided into four tissue prospective collection protocols (CPs) that leverage WU
clinical expertise and patient volume to collect relevant biospecimens. These CPs include: 1) CP1, which will
collect bone marrow from normal donors without chronic disease across ages; 2) CP2, which includes normal
breast, bone marrow and skin from patients undergoing cosmetic breast surgery across ages; 3) CP3, which
includes patients undergoing endoscopy who will provide normal stomach, small bowel, and colon across
ages; and 4) CP4 includes patients undergoing laparoscopic upper gastrointestinal surgery that will provide
normal bone marrow, liver, and skin, again across ages. While our focus is on senescence during human
aging, some patients in CP2 and CP4 will have received prior chemotherapy for cancers in unrelated tissues
(i.e. biospecimens will be from unaffected, cancer-free tissues). This cohort will provide the opportunity to
compare age-matched controls +/- chemotherapy and allow perturbations tested in mice in the Biological
Analysis Core (BAC) to be mapped back to human tissue for relevance, further enriching the bone marrow,
breast, colon, and liver atlases we will produce. The existing infrastructure at WU, our patient volume and the

11196453,"Summary
Bax functions as an essential gateway to apoptotic cell death. Targeting Bax provides a common pathway to
treat NSCLC patients with KRAS or p53 mutations and to overcome resistance to radiotherapy and
chemotherapy. We previously discovered that the serine (S)184 phosphorylation site of Bax is a critical switch
to functionally control Bax’s proapoptotic activity. AKT and PKC have been identified as physiological Bax
kinases that can directly phosphorylate Bax at the S184 site, leading to inactivation of its proapoptotic function.
It is known that KRAS and p53 mutations can activate the PI3K/AKT survival pathway leading to increased
resistance to radiotherapy or chemotherapy in various cancers, including lung cancer. Increased levels of
phospho-Bax (pBax) were observed in tumor tissues in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We
hypothesize that pBax may serve as a new predictive and prognostic biomarker in NSCLC. Expression of
KRAS G12D mutant or p53 R273H mutant or treatment with radiation, cisplatin or RAD001 resulted in
activation of AKT and/or PKC leading to increased phosphorylation of Bax, which may contribute to radio-,
chemo- or rapalog resistance. Development of small molecules that activate Bax may provide a novel
approach for the treatment of mutant KRAS or mutant p53 lung cancer or for overcoming radio-, chemo- or
rapalog resistance. We have identified a novel Bax activator, CYD-2-11, that selectively binds the S184 pocket
of Bax protein but does not bind other Bcl2 family members. CYD-2-11 not only reverses radioresistance but
also overcomes rapalog resistance in vitro. CYD-2-11 potently represses lung cancer xenografts by activating
Bax and inducing apoptosis in tumor tissues. To characterize and develop this novel Bax activator for the
treatment of resistant lung cancer, we propose two specific aims: (1) To determine whether and how KRAS
and p53 mutations regulate Bax activity and treatment resistance in human lung cancer cells. Studies will
determine whether pBax is a novel prognostic biomarker or therapeutic target in patients with NSCLC; (2) To
develop novel small molecule Bax activator (CYD-2-11) by targeting the structural pocket around the Bax
phosphorylation site for lung cancer therapy. Studies will test the antitumor efficacy of CYD-2-11 alone or in
combination with ionizing radiation, chemotherapy, and/or mTOR inhibitor in patient-derived xenograft (PDX),
radioresistant, and genetically engineered mutant KRAS-driven lung cancer animal models. By targeting Bax,

Our group has a well-established history of large-scale omics and imaging data management, processing,
analysis, and interpretation in the context of consortium projects. We have built, used, and maintained data
warehouses and the associated tracking, meta-data, and QC machinery for specimens and raw data and have
developed a large number of computational tools for processing, analyzing, and interpreting such data. The
primary mission of the Data Analysis Core at the Washington University Cellular Senescence Network Tissue
Mapping Center (WU-SN-TMC) will take place along 4 primary dimensions: 1) providing data support to the
Biospecimen and Biological Analysis Cores, 2) processing raw assay data from the Biological Analysis Core
and marrying these with data from other SN-TMCs using cutting-edge informatics pipeline and integrated
approaches, 3) applying processed data to build organ-specific cellular senescence atlases, with a focus on
differences/evolution among demographic groups (especially by age) and within the individual (between
organs and longitudinally), and 4) finally managing delivery of data and research products to the Consortium
Organization and Data Coordinating Center (CODCC) and coordinating further activities toward amalgamation
of findings across the SenNet project. Data Analysis Core will promote cooperation through development of
common formats and interoperable tools for advanced omics and imaging technologies within the SenNet
program, harmonize tools in larger, scalable, user-friendly pipelines and distribute tools to the larger scientific
community under open-source licensing, develop senescence signatures and models using integrated data,
and investigate how nascent technologies will be brought into the research infrastructure to improve processes
and results for senescence research. In conclusion, Data Analysis Core will be a crucial cog within WU-SN-
TMC and serve as a strong link between WU-SN-TMC, CODCC, and other TMCs within SenNet."
11196455,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Emory University’s Lung Cancer SPORE aims to pursue new and innovative research opportunities in the lung
cancer field through the implementation of the Developmental Research Program (DRP). The DRP will solicit,
evaluate, and fund the most meritorious pilot projects, monitor progress twice annually, and promote the most
successful pilot projects into full projects funded by the SPORE and/or other sources. The goals of the DRP
are to identify and support meritorious proposals that might expand into full research projects focused on lung
cancer in the future, including those of high risk-high reward projects that might otherwise not be funded; to
foster collaborative research between Emory investigators and investigators at other institutions; and to
enhance translational research in lung cancer by increasing the number of investigators working in this field.
The Winship Cancer Institute (Winship) of Emory University has a strong track record in conducting successful
pilot project programs. Through the Winship Invest$ program, Winship has awarded 165 pilot grants, with a
total of over $7.7M in funding, since 2012. Our track record is illustrated by the DRP in Emory’s head and neck
cancer SPORE (funded from 2006-2013) that awarded 17 pilot projects, which evolved into 15 full projects
funded by NIH or foundations such as the American Cancer Society and the publication of 34 research articles
and 4 review articles. Winship is also a recipient of the ‘Institutional Research Grant’ funded by the American
Cancer Society that supports pilot research projects. Specific aims for the DRP are as follows: Aim 1: To
solicit research proposals by sending request for proposals (RFP) to all possible applicants at Emory
University and other research and medical institutions throughout the state of Georgia; Aim 2: To identify the
most outstanding and novel proposals to fund through a clearly defined and well-established review process.
Led by a DRP Committee, applications will be reviewed by a panel of leaders of all projects, cores/programs,
and other researchers in relevant fields, following NIH review criteria; and Aim 3: To monitor the progress of
funded peer-reviewed pilot projects using a series of metrics, including the evolution of projects into major
projects (e.g., R01s, full SPORE projects), publications, investigator career development etc. We expect that
annually 2 novel projects in basic, translational and clinical studies will be funded, and completion of these
high-risk but innovative studies will result in strong publications, additional peer-reviewed grants and the
development of a larger and stronger group of investigators focusing on the translational study of lung cancer."

 Crohn’s disease (CD) produces chronic intestinal bowel damage and stenosis in the majority of patients.
Accurate characterization of these strictures is critical, as acute inflammatory strictures can respond to anti-
inflammatory therapy, but chronic strictures, which include both fibrosis and muscular hypertrophy, require
surgical resection. Intestinal fibrosis is an important predictor of future intestinal obstruction and penetrating
complications of CD. The standard diagnostic procedure for CD is endoscopic biopsy, in which small pieces of
tissue are removed from the innermost layer of the intestine for histopathology. Due to limited sampling depth,
endoscopic biopsy does not assess fibrosis in submucosal and muscular layers. Conventional non-invasive
modalities, such as MRI, CT and ultrasound (US), have shown limited sensitivity for intestinal fibrosis. Intestinal
strictures are often a mixture of chronic fibrosis and acute inflammation, which are respectively correlated with
increased collagen and hemoglobin in tissues, which act as molecular markers of distinct CD pathologies. In
addition, extensive previous studies of compressional US elastography have documented that increased
stiffness is a mechanical marker of chronic fibrotic strictures. These molecular and mechanical markers
complement each other, providing orthogonal diagnostic information. A diagnostic imaging procedure that can
simultaneously assess these phenotypes of CD is highly desirable for personalized therapeutic planning and
improved patient outcomes.
 Our preliminary studies in animals in vivo, human tissue samples ex vivo, and in human subjects have
validated that the molecular and mechanical markers of CD stricture pathology can be characterized by
advanced photoacoustic (PA)-US dual modality imaging approaches, including spectroscopic PA imaging, US
elastography, and our recent innovation of strain-PA imaging. An imaging catheter probe compatible with
standard ileocolonoscopy procedures, integrating all these imaging technologies, has been developed and
validated with tissue samples and in animals in vivo.
 Encouraged by our exciting preliminary results, we propose to fill this long-standing prognostic gap with
accurate characterization of molecular and mechanical phenotypes of CD. In the proposed project, we will first
objectively assess the sensitivity and specificity of each molecular and mechanical marker quantified by the
proposed imaging technology through experiments on clinically relevant rabbit models. In addition, to pave the
road to clinical translation, we will examine the feasibility and identify the limitations of the proposed technique
for use during clinical ileocolonoscopy via a pilot study in CD patients. The success of this project will advance
these molecular and mechanical biomarkers of distinct pathologies in CD strictures to practical clinical
measurement with PA-US dual modality endoscopic imaging, enabling accurate prognostic assessment and
treatment monitoring in CD."

This project will use mass spectrometry-based proteomics for biomarker discovery and validation and will
perform early evaluation of strong candidate biomarkers and biomarker signatures that might form the foundation
for new clinical blood tests. These biomarkers can be used as diagnostic tools for early detection of sepsis and/or
facilitate the clinical development of sepsis therapeutics.
Objectives: The focus of this application is on the identification and initial biological, analytical and clinical
evaluation of biomarkers and biomarker signatures for sepsis that will be ready for definitive analytical and clinical
validation.
Central hypothesis: Discovery proteomics using blood samples from well-standardized non-human primate
sepsis models followed by validation in clinical samples has the potential to reveal new biomarker and biomarker
panels for early detection, prognosis and therapy monitoring of sepsis patients.
Rationale: Sepsis is a complex, heterogeneous disease that frequently is complicated with comorbidities (e.g.,
cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease) that can alter the host responses to pathogens, thus making it difficult
to determine the spectrum of sepsis-specific biomarkers by discovery proteomics in clinical plasma samples. We
propose to use unbiased proteomics, coupled with robust bioinformatics to discover novel predictive biomarkers.
We are in a unique position to achieve these goals, having access to well-characterized plasma samples from
historical time-course experiments using baboon models of Gram-negative or Gram-positive bacteremia –
coupled with access to a NIGMS national proteomics resource equipped with world-class instrumentation and
expertise. Further, quantitative proteomics and immunoassays will be used for qualification and validation of the
novel biomarkers in human plasma from sepsis patients.
 Specific Aim 1: Identification and organ mapping of early stage biomarkers during the time course of
 experimental sepsis in baboons.
 Specific Aim 2: Validation and performance testing of biomarker candidates in clinical samples.
Impact: Our short-term goals are to identify biomarkers and biomarker signatures for sepsis in baboons and
perform the initial biological, analytical and clinical evaluation in humans using carefully standardized samples
and datasets. The long-term goal of our project is to deliver novel candidate biomarkers that are ready for
definitive analytical and clinical validation studies. These biomarkers will allow early diagnosis and monitoring of
sepsis progression and will help patient stratification for targeted therapies."
10900480,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
A fundamental problem in cell biology is understanding how DNAs are structured by compaction in the densely
packed cellular environment, and accurately passed down to daughter cells. Chromosome-associated proteins
are key factors in dynamically and accurately organizing chromosomes, and directly influence the replication,
transcription, and translation of genetic information. As such, many diseases including various cancers are linked
to malfunctioning of chromosome-associated proteins. In a majority of bacteria, ParABS partitioning system and
structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) protein complex are main contributors for chromosome
segregation and organization. The ParABS system is composed of ATPase variant ParA, short palindromic DNA
sequence parS, and parS-binding protein ParB. The parS sites are located in the vicinity of bacterial origin of
replication. A longstanding conundrum in the chromosome biology field is that ParB proteins are not only found
on the parS sites but also associate extensive (10-20 kb) flanking regions – a phenomenon termed spreading. It
had been attributed to the ability of ParB protein to bridge different segments of DNA, that allows long-distance
interactions. A new way of thinking derived from recent discoveries that ParB protein is not merely a DNA binding
protein but also a novel CTPase enzyme. It was proposed that cytidine triphosphate (CTP) binding to the ParS
and its subsequent hydrolysis cycle drives self-loading of ParS onto parS sites and subsequent sliding away
from the loading sites. However, this “clamp and sliding” model alone has limitations in accounting for in vivo
chromosome immunoprecipitation data. Another critical role of ParB proteins is that they recruit SMC protein
complex to the vicinity of the replication origin. However, little has been known about the SMC protein recruitment
mechanism. Once recruited, bacterial SMC is thought to organize DNAs by actively extruding DNA loops. This
simple mechanism that can explain many aspects of chromosome structuring is required to be demonstrated
with bacterial SMC complex. The PI has almost 15 years of single-molecule techniques expertise and his lab is
devoted to elucidating the mechanisms of various DNA-binding proteins and their impacts on chromosome
structure. During the next five years, the PI’s laboratory will tackle the outstanding problems of underlying ParB
and bacterial SMC working mechanisms and their interplays utilizing his single-molecule approaches and newly
acquired surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based expertise. Information one could extract from those proteins
in traditional biology approaches is possibly averaged out due to the nature of simultaneous measurements of
multiple proteins (ensemble measurements). Our approach will be expected to uncover hidden mechanisms with
unprecedented details. The in vitro results will be corroborated by in vivo-based assays and theoretical modeling.
The proposed work will pave the way for other future DNA-protein interaction studies. The long-term goal of the
PI’s research program is to elucidate how different DNA-binding proteins and their cofactors cooperate to
maintain the genome stability and dynamics."

I have built a successful patient oriented research program focused on pharmacogenomics,
pharmacoepidemiology, and chronic disease epidemiology with a focus on cardiovascular diseases. My
research goal is to elucidate the role of clinical, environmental and genetic factors on variability in
cardiovascular disease risk and response to medications and to use this information to tailor treatments,
especially in patients with multiple comorbidities.
The proposed award would enable me to continue mentoring while expanding my research program
specifically incorporating implementation science tools to address key translational knowledge gaps. The
new research proposed herein is builds on ongoing work to create unique and much needed patient
oriented research (POR) training opportunities in cardiovascular pharmacotherapeutics and improvement in
risk prediction by incorporating genomic information. My NIH grants along with the four new projects will
form the basis for the mentee (MD, Pharm.D, and PhD) training. Mentorship aims expand the POR training
opportunities for trainees. Mentees will lead the new projects, develop skills related to discovery and
implementation, conduct analysis and publish original research. They will leverage this to propose new
research as part of their NIH- K23 applications.
PROJECT1 will elucidate the differential effect of sex and age on gene-hemorrhage association among
anticoagulant users. PROJECT 2 will evaluate the influence of pharmacogenetic variants on Apixaban and
Rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. PROJECT 3 will evaluate the performance of
bleeding risk scores and the integration of genetics in risk prediction among patients with acute coronary

influence of heart failure on outcomes among patients with ACS undergoing PCI.
In the supportive and collaborative environment of UAB, this award will ensure that I continue to grow my
research program expand to include hybrid implementation-effectiveness designs and build capacity in POR
by mentoring junior investigators to build their own careers. The breadth and depth of the multiple NIH-
funded institutional training programs, UAB’s CTSA and her leadership in UAB’s Translational

10918185,"Abstract:
 The 5-year relative survival of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) patients is only 8%. PDA is
predicted to be the second-leading cause of cancer related death in the U.S. by 2030. Understanding the key
signaling mechanisms of tumorigenesis is critical for developing life-saving interventions. Hereditary
pancreatitis (HP), an autosomal-dominant disorder with recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis (AP) which
eventually develops into chronic pancreatitis (CP), has a cumulative risk of pancreatic cancer of 44% by age
70 years. Cationic trypsinogen gene (or PRSS1) mutations are the most common causes of HP. Unfortunately,
the development of targeted preventive or therapeutic interventions for HP has been hampered by gaps in our
understanding of its pathophysiology, which is mainly due to the practical difficulties in obtaining tissues from
human pancreas at early stages of the disease and the lack of animal models that recapitulate the human form
of this disease. Recently we have developed a novel model of HP by expressing a common mutant of human
PRSS1 (PRSS1R122H) in mice (J Clin Invest. 2020 Jan 2;130(1):189-202). Transgenic expression of mutant
PRSS1 caused severe AP which progresses to CP, precancerous PanIN lesions, and pancreatic cancer. This
model of HP will provide us with a powerful tool to fulfill our long-term goal of understanding the initiating
events of HP and developing specific strategies to prevent its progression to pancreatic cancer. In this
proposal, we will use our unique humanized pancreatitis model to test our central hypothesis that etiological
factors and PRSS1 gene mutation cooperatively cause pancreatic tumorigenesis by intra-acinar cell stress
signaling pathways and a trypsin receptor-mediated constant inflammatory milieu. We will characterize these
signaling pathways in this newly developed HP model and investigate their roles in pancreatic cancer
tumorigenesis by both pharmacological and genetic approaches. We expect these studies will significantly
improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of HP, its progression to pancreatic cancer, and provide new
insights for developing/testing novel preventive and therapeutic interventions."
10928157,"Summary Statement/Abstract
 Pediatric brain tumors are the most common solid tumors in children, with approximately 5000 new cases
diagnosed per year in the United States. Around 17% of brain tumors in children age 0–14 years are high-grade
gliomas (HGGs), which are currently incurable. The lack of effective treatments highlights the urgent need to
identify mechanism-based therapeutic approaches. Substantial experimental evidence has recently revealed
that H3.3-G34R–harboring pediatric HGGs (pHGGs) exhibit high genomic instability and high-level expression
of neuronal markers, indicating that these tumors represent a distinct subtype of pHGG compared with other
types, including the one with an H3.3-K27M mutation. More than 90% of H3.3-G34R gliomas also harbor ATRX
loss-of-function mutations. Using a newly established genetically engineered murine model (GEMM), we
demonstrated that H3.3-G34R mutation and ATRX deletion in premalignant neural stem cells (PM-NSCs) with
the Trp53-/- background could strongly promote gliomagenesis. These tumors exhibit typical features of human
H3.3-G34R–harboring pHGGs, so this GEMM provides us with a faithful tool for studying the molecular
mechanisms underlying the synergistic effects of H3.3-G34R mutation and ATRX deletion and for identifying
novel therapeutic targets. We have found that H3.3-G34R mutation changes histone modifications both locally
and globally and leads to high expression of FoxD1 and HoxA1, transcription factors essential for early neuronal
development. Given that enrichments of FoxD1 and HoxA1 are associated with worse prognosis in glioma
patients, they provide 2 novel therapeutic targets for pHGGs. In addition, we found that ATRX loss leads to ALT
activation, which makes tumor cells sensitive to perturbation of their mitochondrial function. On the basis of these
observations, we hypothesize that distinctive epigenetic profiles induced by H3.3-G34R mutation and ATRX loss
drive gliomagenesis and lead to targetable vulnerabilities involving dysfunctional telomeres and impaired
mitochondrial activity. To test this hypothesis, we plan to 1) determine the roles of FoxD1 and HoxA1 in H3.3-
G34R–driven gliomagenesis, 2) define the therapeutic vulnerability induced by ATRX deficiency in pHGGs, and
3) elucidate the synergistic effect of H3.3-G34R mutation and ATRX loss on epigenetic reprogramming in
gliomas. The completion of the proposed studies will not only fill the gaps in our knowledge of how H3.3-G34R
and ATRX loss change the epigenome to lead to normal neuronal development and gliomagenesis, but also—
and more importantly—contribute to the development of therapeutic strategies that target pHGGs and provide
insights into the role of epigenetic regulation in brain development and gliomagenesis."
10899674,"Hypertension, for unknown reasons, is a primary co-morbidity risk factor for poor COVID-19 outcomes. SARS-
Cov-2 breaches the lung blood-air barrier to spread among organs inducing endothelial cell dysfunction and
multi-organ thromboembolism. ACE2 is the high affinity receptor for SARS-Cov-2 with TMPRSS2 cleavage then
enabling fusion. However, ACE2 and TMPRSS are not co-expressed by all SARS-Cov-2 infected organs.
 We discovered human platelets express ACE2 and TMPRSS, bind SARS-Cov-2 spike protein, and
internalize ACE2-spike protein complexes. SARS-Cov-2 RNA accumulates within platelets.
 Platelets are activated in essential hypertension, transgenic renin expression stimulates fibrosis and
coagulation, and inhibition of coagulation blocks renin fibrosis. The direct renin inhibitor Aliskiren blocks
thrombosis in hypertensive animals, so renin intercalates into coagulation to initiate thromboembolic disease.
 We discovered cells releasing prorenin stimulate explosive platelet activation, but in a unique way; the onset
of activation was very delayed, and activation was always maximal. Mechanistically, prorenin interacted with
quiescent platelets promoting escape of intracellular phosphatidylserine onto the platelet surface.
Phosphatidylserine organizes tenase and prothrombinase coagulation complexes, forming factor Xa and then
thrombin that explosively activated the platelet PAR1 thrombin receptor. Aliskiren abolished phosphatidylserine
expression, thrombin formation, and thrombosis. This establishes renin as a novel, direct platelet agonist.
 Platelets displaying surface phosphatidylserine are rapidly cleared by engulfment by endothelial cells and
perivascular macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system of liver, lung, and spleen. We postulate
hypertension and renin expression promotes phosphatidylserine display on platelets, initiating coagulation and
platelet activation, but also promoting rapid platelet clearance. This, we postulate, internalizes SARS-Cov-2 into
cells that need not express ACE2 or TMPRSS2, themselves.
 Aim 1. Test the hypothesis that renin-activated platelets are entry vectors for SARS-Cov-2 into
endothelial cells and macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system.
 Aim 2. Test the hypothesis renin-stimulated platelet turnover in vivo introduces SARS-Cov-2
pseudotyped lentivirus-platelet complexes into diverse organs.
 This project will establish a functional connection between hypertension and SARS-Cov-2 infection, identify
renin activated platelets as novel SARS-Cov-2 entry vectors, and define a basis for altered platelet clearance in
renin-clamped hypertensive mice. This provides a translational basis for Aliskiren use to normalize hypertension
risk in COVID-19, elucidates novel approaches to suppress SARS-Cov-2 organ infection and damage, and
establish circulating platelet ACE2 expression as a measure of risk for COVID-19 multi-organ damage."
10911867,"PROJECT SUMMARY
High dietary sodium intake is linked to incident hypertension (HTN) and cardiovascular events. Conversely,
lower sodium intake has been shown to reduce both blood pressure (BP) and prevent atherosclerotic
cardiovascular diseases (ASCVD). American Heart Association guidelines advocate daily sodium intake of less
than 2,300 mg, but the estimated average sodium intake for Americans is 3,400 mg per day. In recent years,
consumption of pre-processed and restaurant foods has substantially increased, and more than 75% of sodium
in the average U.S. diet now comes from these sources.
Despite widespread knowledge of the harms of high dietary sodium intake, an ongoing challenge for clinicians
is engaging patients in lifestyle-based treatments to reverse these trends as well as promote ongoing self-
management and long-term adherence to low sodium diets. Although there is growing hope that digital health
platforms may help to overcome these issues, few empirical studies have demonstrated their efficacy over
time. Relying on a strong conceptual framework in health behavior theory, we recently demonstrated in early
work that a mobile application-based just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) reduces dietary sodium intake
(R21HS024567). This JITAI uses geofencing technology to provide tailored and contextual push notifications at
home, grocery stores, and restaurants with links to sodium-based nutrition information within the mobile
application. While our preliminary results were exciting, the critical gaps in knowledge that remain to be tested
are 1) whether a mobile application-based JITAI focused on lowering sodium intake will lead to a decrease in
BP, 2) which dietary components mediate the intervention's effect on BP, and 3) how to optimize participant
engagement to sustain both dietary and BP effects over time and prevent habituation.
The long-term goal of our research program is to develop successful mobile application-based strategies,
driven by adaptive technologies, that support patient self-management in common cardiovascular conditions.
Our overall objectives are to evaluate the efficacy of a dietary sodium JITAI on reducing BP, establish the
changes in diet that mediate improvement in BP, and optimize the JITAI for long-term patient engagement. Our
central hypothesis is that JITAIs targeting dietary sodium will reduce BP over time and that these effects will be
better sustained through optimization of JITAIs. Accordingly, we will perform a two-step sequential,
prospective, randomized controlled trial in 400 HTN patients to meet our overall objectives. In the first step, we
will investigate the effect of the JITAI on BP and perform a micro-randomized trial to optimize the JITAI for
patient engagement. In the second step, we will study the sustained effects of an optimized JITAI on BP."

10912466,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Effective antiretroviral therapy has increased the lifespan of people living with HIV (PLWH). Alcohol use,
common among PLWH, plays an important role in the risk for and management of HIV-associated
comorbidities. Unhealthy alcohol use can exacerbate two prevalent HIV-related co-occurring conditions,
chronic pain and physical inactivity, which in conjunction with alcohol use affect physical and mental function
and are associated with a variety of HIV-related comorbidities. We propose the Boston Alcohol Research
Collaboration on HIV/AIDS – Comorbidity Center (Boston ARCH CC) as an extension of the Boston
Alcohol Research Collaboration of HIV/AIDS (ARCH). In Boston ARCH CC two clinical trials will test
interventions aimed at unhealthy alcohol use, pain, and physical inactivity, that impact a variety of other HIV-
related comorbidities. The ARCH CC BDM Core will work closely with ARCH CC investigators, providing
experience, expertise, and resources toward the planning, conduct, and data analysis of the work of Boston
ARCH CC. ARCH CC will also continue to make the existing Boston ARCH Cohort available for secondary
analyses, with a focus on mentoring and developing young investigators, and the ARCH CC BDM Core will
provide support for developing proposals and conducting analyses of the cohort. The first aim of the ARCH
CC BDM Core is to provide comprehensive data management and statistical support for the two ARCH
CC clinical trials. Both of these trials focus on behavioral telehealth interventions. Research Project
Component-Pain tests the efficacy of an integrated telehealth intervention incorporating motivational and
cognitive-behavioral management for reducing unhealthy drinking and chronic pain in PLWH. Research Project
Component-Physical Activity tests the efficacy of a home-based lifestyle physical activity intervention with
mobile-health delivered components to decrease unhealthy drinking and increase physical activity in PLWH.
The second aim of ARCH CC BDM is to support secondary analyses of the existing Boston ARCH
cohort, and provide support and mentoring to trainees and investigators accessing the cohort. The
Boston ARCH cohort enrolled PLWH with current or past unhealthy alcohol use, collecting longitudinal data on
alcohol and other drug use and disorders, HIV-related treatment and medication use, health-related behaviors,
and physical and mental function outcomes."
10912471,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The era of antiretroviral therapy has shown increasing life expectancy and decreased HIV-related deaths,
leading to a growing older adult HIV population. Yet, HIV accelerates the aging process and increases risk for
numerous chronic health conditions that compromise physical and mental health functioning. Further, in this
context, unhealthy alcohol use is common among persons living with HIV (PLWH) and also increases risk for
negative outcomes. Yet, there are few interventions to address unhealthy alcohol use in PLWH that have
resulted in significant effects nor have they employed approaches that could impact these multimorbidities.
Therefore, intervention approaches that may have significant impact on unhealthy drinking in PLWH are
necessary, particularly if they also have the potential to affect the physical and mental health multimorbidities
common in PLWH. Efforts toward addressing another highly prevalent condition among PWLH – physical
inactivity and sedentariness, may prove beneficial for changing unhealthy drinking and physical and mental
health functioning. To date, physical activity (PA) approaches in PLWH have primarily consisted of structured,
supervised, gym-based interventions that have resulted in positive outcomes but have been limited in their
reach and associated with high drop-out in this population. Here we propose an alternate paradigm – home-
based, lifestyle physical activity (LPA) with mobile health-delivered components that have the potential to
address existing limitations of previous approaches. LPA interventions consist of behavioral strategies that
guide individuals to integrate intermittent bouts of PA in their daily routines. An added strength of the LPA
approach is it may be well-suited for PLWH engaged in unhealthy drinking by providing cumulative physical
and mental health effects from regular, daily PA as well as acute effects on negative affect (common among
PLWH engaged in unhealthy drinking) and urges to drink via individual, brief bouts of activity. To date, LPA
interventions have not been tested in PLWH. As such, through online recruitment of PLWH, we will identify 220
HIV+ unhealthy drinkers and randomize them to the 12-week LPA+Fitbit intervention or to a Fitbit Only
condition. Primary outcomes will include drinks/drinking day and objectively-determined steps/day at end of
treatment and 6-month follow-ups. Changes between conditions on physical and mental health functioning,
alcohol-related problems, coping, PA motivation, and PA self-efficacy will be examined as secondary
outcomes. In addition, to elucidate mechanisms of intervention effects, we will employ two bursts of ecological
momentary assessment to obtain multiple daily measures of affect, urges to drink, alcohol consumption, and
PA engagement coupled with objective assessment of PA. If the LPA+Fitbit intervention proves efficacious, our
lifestyle approach using mobile health technology will directly affect the significant multimorbidity in this at-risk
population of PLWH engaged in unhealthy drinking, which in turn may have significant public health impact."
10912475,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Unhealthy drinking and chronic pain are common co-occurring conditions among people living with HIV
(PLWH) each of which negatively influences physical and mental functioning, HIV-related outcomes, and one
another. Health care providers face a number of challenges to addressing these frequently co-occurring
conditions for PLWH including restricted time and resources, limitations of pharmacological treatments to
adequately treat both conditions (particularly among those with other co-occurring medical conditions or
substance use histories), and poor patient adherence to recommended non-pharmacological treatments.
Although there are empirically-supported behavioral approaches to address the full spectrum of each of these
conditions, they often require multiple session, in-person interventions. Such requirements are burdensome to
PLWH, who may face stigma and considerable economic challenges regarding transportation, child-care, and
missed work. These challenges are compounded when considering treatments for multiple conditions. Given
the rates of chronic pain and heavy drinking among PLWH, their combined impact on daily functioning and
HIV-outcomes, and available treatment limitations, there would be considerable benefit to an integrative
behavioral approach to address these comorbid conditions in a manner that may be easily utilized by patients.
In our prior work, we have developed an integrated behavioral video telehealth intervention designed to reduce
unhealthy alcohol use and chronic pain among PLWH. This intervention, Motivational and Cognitive
Behavioral Treatment for the Management of Alcohol Use and Pain (MCBMAP) is a 7-session integrated
intervention that is delivered through telehealth and supplemented with materials available on a website. The
intervention, which was tailored for PLWH based on qualitative interviews, has been shown to have high
patient acceptability and be readily delivered through smartphones. The current study seeks to test the efficacy
of this intervention for reducing unhealthy drinking and chronic pain in a fully-scaled, randomized controlled
trial among PLWH that compares MCBMAP to a Brief Advice and Information condition at 6-month outcomes.
In addition, this project will examine moderators and mediators of intervention through self-report
questionnaires and through the use of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) conducted before and after
treatment. These EMA methods will allow us to examine how the processes through which the intervention
may reduce unhealthy drinking and pain as well as provide insight into the association between pain, unhealthy
drinking, and functional outcomes in this population."

10853031,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Preeclampsia is a major source of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality in pregnancy. Multiple studies have documented abnormalities in placental trophoblasts obtained from preeclamptic pregnancies at term, in development and function of both syncytiotrophoblast (STB) and extravillous trophoblast (EVTB). These cell types arise early in gestation, and it is unclear whether the abnormalities contribute to the pathophysiology of preeclampsia or are only a result of the preeclamptic environment. The proposed project will use three innovative models to address this gap in knowledge: (1) Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), derived from control and preeclamptic pregnancies and differentiated to a mixed population of peri-implantation stage trophoblast by exposure to BMP4, and signaling inhibitors; (2) Induced trophoblast stem cells (TSC), obtained by conversion of the control and EOPE iPSC lines, and differentiated to the first trimester, villous stage of placental development, along either the STB or EVTB lineage; (3) 3D trophoblast organoids, derived from the TSC lines, and differentiated to predominantly STB or EVT. There are three specific aims: Aim 1 will test whether STB differentiation and, as a consequence, function, is defective in EOPE in the various models of first trimester placenta. Aim 1A will test the hypothesis that defects in STB assembly and function will be discernible in EOPE in the models of peri-implantation and villous STB developed in this laboratory, particularly under conditions of oxidative stress. In Aim 1B, single nucleus RNAseq will be used to distinguish whether TB types, especially the two previously identified clusters of 8TB, are differentially affected. Aim 2 will characterize EVTB differentiation and invasive properties in normal pregnancy and EOPE by using the TSC models. Aim 2A will determine whether defective TB invasion in EOPE is characteristic of first trimester-like EVTB, as it is in peri-implantation TB. Aim 28 will utilize organoid cultures to assess EVTB differentiation in 3-dimensional space, in homology to anchoring villi, and the role of cell-matrix interactions in acquisition of specific EVTB subtypes. Aim 3 will determine whether mitochondrial defects affect EVT and STB in EOPE Aim 3A will determine whether diminished ATP production reduces invasion in EOPE under stressful conditions. Aim 3B will test whether EOPE TBs are more susceptible to stress-induced production of reactive oxygen species. Accomplishment of these aims will uncover the mechanisms behind impaired STB and EVTB differentiation and function in patient-derived culture models of first trimester placental development."
10912730,"SUMMARY - Project 2: DSBR: Mechanisms of DNA double strand break repair and pathway selection
Understanding how cells detect and repair DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) is critical to improving patient
responses to radiation therapy and many forms of chemotherapy. The major pathway for repair of DSBs in
normal cells is non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which is active throughout interphase but error prone.
However, in S and G2 phases, the more accurate homology directed repair (HDR) pathway is also active.
Moreover, cancer cells sometimes use highly error-prone, mutagenic alternative-end joining (Alt-EJ) pathways
for DSB repair. While we know a significant amount about the proteins involved in each pathway, there are wide
knowledge gaps in understanding how these pathways intersect and how they are regulated in normal and
cancer cells. Project 2 brings together leading investigators with expertise in NHEJ, HDR and Alt-EJ to determine
how DNA end resection directs DSB repair pathway choice. In Aim 1 we will determine how NHEJ proteins
tether broken DSB ends in synaptic complexes prior to processing to remove damaged end groups, and how
DNA ligase IV uniquely catalyzes rejoining of DSB ends. We will also determine how the nuclease Artemis and
the end-processing enzyme PNKP interact with synaptic complexes, providing the first comprehensive view of
how NHEJ complexes function at DSBs. In Aim 2, we will explore how Artemis interacts with the MRN complex
to regulate the initial stages of resection, how the short- and long-range resection machineries are coupled and
how the tumor suppressor BRCA1-BARD1 complex stimulates long range resection by DNA2/BLM. In Aim 3 we
will determine how XRCC1/DNA ligase III interacts with MRN and DNA polymerase  to link DNA resection,
gap-filling DNA synthesis and ligation during Alt-EJ and how DNA polymerase  interacts with the key HDR
protein, RAD51. Our studies will yield unprecedented molecular level insights into fundamentally important DNA
repair pathways, and will also paint a comprehensive picture of how DSB repair pathways act together as an
integrated network to repair radiation and chemotherapy-induced DSBs in cancer cells and non-malignant cells.
The information generated by Project 2 will pave the way for novel approaches to better target tumors in the
clinic. Indeed, small molecule inhibitors of NHEJ protein DNA-PKcs are in clinical trials and inhibitors of Artemis,
PNKP, MRE11 and DNA ligases are being evaluated in pre-clinical cancer models, Moreover, novel Pol 
inhibitors with the potential to selectively target cancer cells that are dependent upon Alt-EJ will be identified in
Project 2 by our structure-based approaches. EMB core expertise in protein expression and cutting-edge
biophysical approaches of the SCB core are critical for the success of our project, which is fully synergistic with
Project 4 on replication fork preservation, Project 3 on the role of PARP1 and PARylation in DSB repair, and
Project 1 on the cellular responses induced by DSB-inducing chemotherapeutics. We will share and exchange
ideas, results, and reagents with all the SBDR investigators, contributing to a scientific environment conducive
for advancing mechanism- and structure-based cancer therapies and for the training of students and fellows."
10930871,"Project Summary – Project 1
Parkinsonian motor signs in rodents are frequently studied with dopamine depletion initiated by unilateral or
bilateral 6-OHDA injections into the median forebrain bundle or striatum. The striatal dopamine loss leads to
abnormal neuronal activity in elements of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical motor circuit, including an increase
of beta frequency oscillations, increased bursting activities of neurons, increased synchrony between neurons,
and changed spike rates. These changes are principally similar to those found in MPTP treated primates and
human patients with Parkinson’s disease. The pathological activity patterns have been followed from their stria-
tal origin to the globus pallidus, substantia nigra pars reticulata, and the subthalamic nucleus. An important gap
in our understanding of the consequences of dopamine depletion is the lack of data concerning the neural pro-
cessing in the parkinsonian condition in motor and premotor areas. Investigations into this issue require a cell
type-specific analysis of neural activity in cortex, as the complex cortical microcircuitry leads to the expectation
that different subtypes of neurons engage differentially in parkinsonian activity patterns. In this project, we lev-
erage our ability to combine behavioral studies and mechanistic studies on the single-neuron level available in
rodents to address the overall hypothesis that corticospinal projection neurons (CSNs) and STN projecting py-
ramidal tract neurons (PT-STN) are differentially involved in parkinsonian activity patterns. About 1/3rd of PT-
STN neurons also project to the spinal cord, but are expected to be a minority of CSNs and likely project to dif-
ferent spinal cord targets. Under aim 1, we will address this hypothesis at the systems level by studying CSN
and PT-STN activity in the caudal and rostral forelimb areas of mice (CFA and RFA, respectively) in relation to
a locomotor task, response inhibition, and food reaching behavior in mice that are bilaterally dopamine-de-
pleted through 6-OHDA injections into the dorsolateral striatum. To assess parkinsonian network activity pat-
terns, we will employ cell type-specific voltage imaging with genetically expressed voltage indicators (GEVIs).
Further, we will record single unit activities in CFA and RFA with chronically implanted silicon probes and opto-
tagging of CSNs and PT-STN neurons. In aim 2, we will study the cellular basis of dysfunction in these cell
types through brain slice recordings to uncover intrinsic and synaptic property changes. We will use computer
modeling to determine the impact of the observed changes on the synaptic integration properties of both cell
types. The planned studies are closely aligned with project 2 that addresses corticospinal neuron activity in the
primate supplementary motor area and primary motor cortex following dopamine depletion with MPTP, with
project 3 that examines changes in synaptic connectivity in the cortical network, and with project 4 that looks at
oscillatory components in motor cortical activity in human Parkinson’s disease patients and behavioral perfor-
mance in a response inhibition task."
10930878,"Project Summary – Project 2
Striatal dopamine loss in Parkinson’s disease triggers abnormal neuronal activity in the extrastriatal basal ganglia
and thalamus. Such changes undoubtedly influence the processing of information in cortical motor fields, con-
tributing to clinical features of parkinsonism such as akinesia or bradykinesia. However, cortical activity changes
remain poorly understood, in part because of the complexity of the organization of the cortical areas that partic-
ipate in the basal ganglia thalamocortical ‘motor’ circuit. Neurons in the motor portion of the basal ganglia output
nuclei project to neurons in the ventral motor thalamus which, in turn, send their projections mostly to the sup-
plementary motor area (SMA), with additional projections to the primary motor cortex (M1). Previous studies of
cortical activity in MPTP-treated parkinsonian monkeys showed that corticospinal neurons in M1 change their
spontaneous and task-related activity in the parkinsonian state. However, much remains to be known about
activity changes of corticospinal projection neurons in the SMA and the effects of antiparkinsonian therapies on
cortical activity. Under aim 1, we will study the parkinsonism-associated changes in spontaneous and task-re-
lated activities of neurons in SMA and M1 that give rise to projections to the cervical spinal cord. To identify these
specific neurons, we will inject retrogradely transported viruses (AAV2-retro) into the cervical spinal cord, to
express opsins in corticospinal neurons, which will then enable identification of these neurons by opto-tagging
during cortical optrode recordings. For aim 2, we will investigate whether antiparkinsonian treatments (systemic
levodopa injections, or deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus) influence the altered cortical activities
in the parkinsonian state. We hypothesize that the antiparkinsonian interventions will normalize some of the
changes identified in aim 1, but that their primary actions may differ. For example, stimulation of the subthalamic
nucleus may induce prominent activity changes in corticospinal projection neurons due to antidromic activation
(by stimulation of corticosubthalamic collaterals of the corticospinal pathway), an effect that is obviously not
expected to occur with levodopa treatment. The proposed studies will significantly contribute to our understand-
ing of the pathophysiology of parkinsonism and of the effects of antiparkinsonian therapies, and may pave the
way for new antiparkinsonian treatments, such as chemogenetic approaches or new deep brain stimulation ap-
proaches, to normalize activity patterns of the studied corticospinal neurons. The planned studies are closely
aligned with those in project 1 (studies with similar questions, examined with wide-field imaging and brain slice
recordings in rodents, as well as computational modeling), project 3 (studies of ultrastructural synaptic plasticity
affecting specific projection neuron families in the primate SMA and M1), and project 4 (studies of cortical elec-
trophysiological effects of parkinsonism or antiparkinsonian therapies on response inhibition functions in hu-
mans). The planned work will utilize the administrative help of core A, and the anatomy, behavioral assessment
and statistics services provided by core B."
10912733,"SUMMARY- PROJECT 3-PARP: PAR-dependent, phase-transitioned protein assemblies and DNA repair
Poly-ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs) utilize NAD+ as a donor for ADP-ribose modification of proteins and for
the subsequent additions that generate poly-ADP-ribose (PAR) on these targets. PARP1 and PARP2 are the
predominant enzymes in humans that catalyze PARylation in response to DNA damage and are critical targets
of cancer therapeutics. Rapid formation of PAR occurs at many different types of DNA lesions and has been
shown to be is required for the timely recruitment of DNA repair enzymes. In addition, PAR recruits polypeptides
containing low-complexity domains and intrinsically disordered regions. Some of these disordered proteins form
phase transitions between soluble, gel, and fibrous states. PAR thus seeds phase condensates at sites of DNA
damage to create a specialized compartment for repairing DNA. Despite the fundamental importance of this
phenomenon, we know very little about the structural basis for PARP generation of PAR polymers at DNA
damage sites or the mechanistic role of PAR-seeded phase transitions in promoting DNA repair. Here we
hypothesize that PAR-driven phase separation regulates DNA repair outcomes at diverse DNA lesions and that
the length and structure of PAR polymer is critical for tuning these outcomes. We will test this hypothesis by
investigating the mechanistic basis of ADP-ribose addition and PAR formation by PARP1/2 in the context of
cofactor HPF1 using structural biology, ensemble biochemistry, and single-molecule methods (Aim 1). Structural
insights from this effort will produce a working model for PARP1/2 catalytic activity as well as a toolbox of
PARP1/2 mutants that generate varying lengths and structures of PAR. As part of this effort we will also develop
inhibitors for the primary glycohydrolase that removes DNA damage-induced ADP-ribose modifications (ARH3).
We will probe the role of phase transitions in DNA repair by using FUS and other low-complexity proteins to
investigate the structural basis of their interactions with PAR-seeded domains of various lengths (Aim 2). Lastly,
we will determine the effects of phase transitions on the recruitment and activity of DNA double-strand break
repair complexes in vitro, as well as the effects of these transitions on the repair of multiple types of DNA damage
in human cells (Aim 3). These efforts join P3 with the other projects in SBDR5 by collaborating to identify effects
of lesion-specific PARylation on the repair of alkylation damage, double-strand breaks, and stalled replication
forks. In addition, we will determine the composition of PAR-seeded domains in response to DNA damage and
how this changes in response to clinically used PARP and glycohydrolase inhibitors. This project will produce
structural and mechanistic insights into the dynamic regulation of PAR synthesis and disassembly that occurs in
human cells and will determine how the PAR-seeded phase transitions at these sites affect DNA repair and
therapeutic outcomes."
10916381,"Project Summary/Abstract
Monitoring and optimizing dietary intake are important for precision nutrition in the treatment of clinical
conditions (diabetes, obesity, kidney/liver failure, etc) as well as attenuating loss of muscle function and mass
during aging. However, current methods for personal health monitoring do not provide reliable measurement of
macronutrient intake or availability of metabolites after digestion. Thus, this project aims to address this gap by
developing multi-analyte sensing devices based on an innovative combination of insertable optical reporters,
wearable readers, and advanced computational methods. These devices will provide continuous/on-demand
measurement of metabolites in interstitial fluid (ISF), then use those measures to predict macronutrient intake.
The project is organized into three specific aims: Aim 1 will involve collecting blood samples and ISF samples
(via microdialysis) from healthy human subjects consuming fresh meals and then using machine learning
methods to establish a quantitative relationship between macronutrient intake and the resulting blood and ISF
levels of metabolites. Fresh meals will be designed by the investigators to have three different levels of protein
and carbohydrates. Data will be analyzed to establish quantitative relationships between compartmental
concentrations, identifying proportionality coefficients and temporal lag/lead parameters, and develop machine-
learning models to predict macronutrients in meals from the plasma and ISF concentrations of metabolites.
Aim 2 will proceed in parallel with Aim 1, focusing on modifying current oxygen and glucose-sensing devices to
measure amino acids. Extensive benchtop testing will be used to verify accuracy and precision of calibration
based on fusion of sensor data streams. Aim 3 will then focus on deploying and testing a removable version of
the multi-analyte sensing system in human subjects. Participants will be fitted with the sensors, a microdialysis
catheter, and a continuous glucose monitor. Subjects will consume fresh meals as well as macronutrient-
matched frozen meals, matched for contents, to verify that the system (sensors and algorithms) also work for
meals that are more representative of the diet for many Americans, especially in low-income communities. The
computational algorithms developed in Aim 1 will be used to predict macronutrient availability from sensor data
as well as microdialysis. Sex, skin color, and health indicators (BMI, HbA1c, etc) will be factored into analyses
to assess whether they substantially affect performance of instrumentation and algorithms.
This project will bring together a team of biomedical engineers, computer scientists, and nutrition & metabolism
researchers to develop instrumentation and collect data from human subjects that will yield: new knowledge
and insight on the relationship between nutritional intake and systemic metabolite levels (Aim 1); advances in
technology for sensing metabolites as nutritional biomarkers (Aim 2); evaluation of the sensing technology and
computational models in diverse human subjects consuming common meals. (Aim 3). Success in this project
will advance research on metabolism and support development of new approaches to personalized nutrition."
10900777,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The major barrier toward the eradication of HIV-1 infection is the presence of a small reservoir of latently
infected cells that escape immune-mediated clearance. Due to the lack of transcriptional activity, latent
proviruses in vivo are not easily detectable and cannot be targeted by either natural immune mechanisms or
molecular therapies. Therefore, understanding how HIV-1 transcription is regulated will open doors to novel
therapeutic strategies targeting the latent reservoir.
 Pharmacological approaches to reactivate the latent reservoir in vivo have been considered as potential
eradication therapies for more than a decade. However, the effectiveness of these approaches has been
disappointing as only a minority of latently infected cells appear to be responsive to latency-reversing agents. A
deeper understanding of the transcriptional regulation of the HIV-1 promoter is necessary before we can design
novel and effective LRAs. Cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor 6 (CPSF6) is a cellular protein with
multiple functions both in cellular and viral biology. Our recent finding that CPSF6 controls the stability and activity
of PP2A, a phosphatase directly implicated in the de-phosphorylation and inactivation of CDK9 and RNA Pol II,
reveals an exciting new line of investigation into potential cure strategies. This proposal will focus on the following
innovative directions: (a) to further understand the factors regulating HIV-1 transcription, with a focus on CPSF6
and PP2A; (b) to explore the possibility of using PP2A inhibition as a method to reactivate latent viruses; and (3)
to further explore the unknown functions of CPSF6 based on a recent proteomics experiment from our group
yielding several exciting hits."
10913557,"ABSTRACT
 Transmembrane proteins, which constitute 20%-30% of human genes, play essential roles in coupling
cells and in sensing mechanical and biochemical signals from the environment. However, it is extremely
challenging to map transmembrane protein interactions using traditional biochemical methods. The first goal of
this proposal is to develop Binding Assay for Interacting Transmembrane proteins (BAIT), a molecular technology
to discover novel transmembrane protein interactions in cells. BAIT will be performed in two steps. First, we will
screen for transmembrane proteins that are located proximal to a target protein, by dual tagging both the
extracellular and cytoplasmic region of the target with a proximity labeling enzyme. Next, we will directly test
binding interactions between proximal proteins and the target protein using single molecule Atomic Force
Microscopy (AFM) and also visualize co-localization of the target and binding partner using super-resolution
fluorescence microscopy. We anticipate that BAIT will have a game changing impact in discovering novel
transmembrane junctional proteins interactions on the cell surface.
 The second goal of our proposal is to use BAIT, along with other biophysical tools, to resolve the
assembly and organization of desmosomes, an essential intercellular adhesive organelle that mediates the
integrity of tissues like the epidermis and heart. While mutations in desmosomal proteins are common in
hereditary heart diseases and in skin pathologies, the molecular mechanisms by which these proteins assemble
at the plasma membrane are unknown. Since previous studies show that desmosome formation requires E-
cadherin (Ecad), a ubiquitous cell-cell adhesion protein, we developed a prototype BAIT assay using Ecad as
the target and discovered that two obligate desmosomal adhesive proteins, Desmocollin (Dsc) and Desmoglien
(Dsg), bind to Ecad extracellular regions. Using biophysical experiments and cellular structure function studies
we showed that Ecad recruits Dsg to intercellular contacts, and triggers desmosome formation. In Aim 2 of the
proposal, we will characterize binding interfaces and kinetics of Ecad and Dsc/Dsg interactions and determine
their binding conformations using single molecule AFM binding assays, single molecule Fluorescence
Resonance Energy Transfer and computer simulations. We will also introduce mutant Ecad, Dsc and Dsg in
epithelial cells and monitor desmosome assembly and ultrastructure using super-resolution fluorescence
microscopy. These studies will provide key molecular insights into desmosomal integrity in both healthy tissues
and in disease states."
10907675,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Alopecia areata (AA) is a common autoimmune disease in which the hair follicle is the target of attack
and results clinically in hair loss. Despite the associated high lifetime risk of approximately 2% and its substantive
psychosocial impact, no FDA approved treatments exist for AA. The lack of effective options for the population
that suffers from this disfiguring disease with significant psychosocial ramifications represents a significant unmet
medical need.
 The absence of approved treatments is in part due to an incomplete understanding of the unbalanced
equilibrium between pathogenic immune responses and immunoregulatory mechanisms that prevent
autoimmunity in AA. Although many cytokines, pathways, and cell types have been hypothesized to prevent
immune attack of the hair follicle, it is unknown what factors participate in regulating autoimmune responses in
vivo. Identifying these critical immunoregulatory participants may not only deepen our understanding of AA
pathogenesis, but may reveal anti-inflammatory pathways that may be exploited to develop novel approaches to
treatment.
 IL-27 is a cytokine with immunoregulatory properties that has been studied in various autoimmune,
infectious, and tumor models. The receptor for IL-27 is expressed by a wide array of immune cell types as well
as epithelial and endothelial cells, supporting its potential to modulate the immune system and critical cell
types that interact with the immune system. In particular, IL-27 has been shown to dampen conventional T cell
responses, increase the number of regulatory T cells, and induce naïve and previously activated CD4 and CD8
T cells to produce IL-10, a well-known cytokine with anti-inflammatory effects in most contexts. Our
preliminary data indicate that overexpression of IL-27 can substantially prevent the development of murine AA,
and further analysis revealed regulatory T cells and IL-10 as potential downstream candidates participating in
disease suppression.
 We propose to study the mechanisms of AA suppression of exogenous IL-27 and its downstream
effects on regulating immune responses to the hair follicle and preventing the development of AA. We have
adopted and further developed a spontaneous AA mouse model to robustly develop disease in an inducible,
controlled, and well-characterized manner by adoptive transfer of activated pathogenic T cells. Combining our
AA model with newly developed genetic tools will allow us to dissect the mechanisms by which IL-27 may be
used to ablate AA pathogenesis and has the potential to reveal novel therapeutic strategies."
10925321,"PROJECT SUMMARY 
Inherited retinal diseases (IRD), such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP), Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), are a common cause of visual impairment worldwide. Recent studies show that cell replacement therapy is a promising therapeutic option for IRD patients with severe retinal degeneration that destroys photoreceptors. We and others recently reported long-term survival and integration of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) or human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) derived retinas in a novel laser-induced photoreceptor degeneration model. While the laser ablation model can be generated rapidly as an acute degeneration model, it does not have the progressive pathophysiological nature (e.g., disease time course, retinal remodeling, etc.) of IRD. To address this issue, we developed a highly efficient genome-editing technology, Platinum Talen, which leads to gene disruption in multiple organisms with high efficacy and specificity. By applying Platinum Talen to this novel model, we achieved one-step generation of biallelic gene modifications with high efficiency (40-50%) in preliminary studies. Since substantial information regarding the survival and integration of transplanted photoreceptor cells or retinal sheets have been obtained in laser injury models, we propose a two-pronged strategy to generating novel translation-enabling models to evaluate survival and integration of regenerated photoreceptors in the visual system: 1) to use laser-induced photoreceptor degeneration model; 2) one-step generation of biallelic mutants by Platinum Talen. We will then systematically compare the survival and integration of regenerated photoreceptors in the two model systems. Aim 1 will generate novel models of photoreceptor degeneration by laser ablation and Platinum Talen. Aim 2 will perform comprehensive ophthalmic phenotyping of laser-induced and Talen-edited models of photoreceptor degeneration. Aim 3 will evaluate survival and integration of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived retina sheets in the two models of photoreceptor degeneration."

Abstract
The Development Core stimulates and supports new HIV science and scientists through a variety of essential
services that promote and facilitate research development and research careers. The Pilot Project Program
provides small grants to CIRA affiliates; the Peer Review Program provides expert guidance and feedback on
grants, manuscripts, and presentations for CIRA affiliates; and the Visiting Fellow program promotes
international collaborations in high impact areas. The Core also supports several HIV training programs for
junior scientists that are affiliated with CIRA and located in our Center(e.g., T32, R25, D43). Through its role
with CIRA-affiliated training programs, the Core facilitates and expands access to resources that are essential
to the successful conduct of HIV research, including community-based and community-engaged research and
fosters a positive, enriching environment for aspiring HIV researchers and particularly those underrepresented
in the field and/or those seeking to focus on HIV disparities in their research, in areas and with populations
most impacted by HIV. CIRA’s Mentored Network of HIV Scholars provides additional support and structure
for early-career CIRA affiliates to help them build their professional network, develop a robust professional
support system, and help traverse challenging academic and funding systems. The Development Core will
integrate health equity approaches (e.g., implementation science, community-engaged research, anti-racist
mentorship) within all Development Core activities to help ensure that CIRA-affiliated research contributes to
equitable advances in HIV prevention. Through the proposed activities, the Development Core will make a
significant and unique contribution to CIRA’s mission of supporting research leading to sustainable impact on

Abstract
The Justice, Community Capacity and Equity (JuCCE) Core provides services that stimulate, promote and
advance the conduct of innovative Community-Engaged Research (CEnR) by CIRA scientists and community
research partners. The JuCCE Core achieves its mission through outreach, relationship and capacity building,
and by providing guidance on CEnR and Implementation Science (IS) methods, particularly as they relate to
small urban areas with a high prevalence of HIV. To effectively achieve the national Ending the HIV Epidemic
(EHE) goals requires moving beyond “science for the sake of knowledge”, towards an impact-driven approach
designed to achieve equity in the national HIV response. Researchers working with impacted communities
must have the appropriate tools to conduct IS and CEnR that optimizes equity in the impact of research on
EHE goals. Rigorous IS, conducted through an equity lens, is key to maximizing the effectiveness of evidence-
based interventions to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS. Critically, we must center the needs of disproportionately
impacted communities and organizations that serve them throughout the research process. The JuCCE Core
facilitates research collaborations with organizational-level and individual-level stakeholders of populations that
have not equitably benefited from scientific advances in HIV prevention and treatment. Participatory and critical
social science approaches will be leveraged to strengthen community capacity to participate in the conduct of
research and to benefit from research advances, producing more equitable scientific impact on local HIV
epidemic responses. HIV prevention and treatment impact is most urgently needed in small urban areas and
EHE priority communities that lack the capacity of large urban settings to provide highly effective and culturally
relevant status neutral HIV care (i.e., HIV prevention and treatment services across the continuum regardless
of one’s HIV status). CIRA’s Community Research and Implementation (CRI) Core—on which the JuCCE Core
is built—has made important regional impacts through its leadership of the New England HIV Implementation
Science Network and is well-positioned to continue its impact in New England while also providing services to
affiliates conducting research in underserved EHE regions. The Core’s scientists are deeply committed to
ethically responsible and responsive CEnR as a primary principle of social justice and health equity.
Collectively, we have worked in health clinics, housing developments, prisons, churches, community-based
organizations, AIDS service organizations, and legislative chambers. Recognizing the necessity of community
partnership in developing research priorities, conducting research, and disseminating findings, we are
dedicated to facilitating these skills among our affiliates through training, consultations, and connections.

populations. The Core will provide opportunities for those interested in learning more about and using DISM
research methods by offering webinars on methodologic topics of interest, by engaging trainees and
colleagues in the planning and conduct of their own activities, and hands-on one-on-one mentoring. In addition,
the Core will provide pre-application consultations for applicants intending to submit to CIRA’s pilot project and
to external funding through CIRA’s peer review of proposals."
10906928,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of how metabolism changes in many diseases because we
lack methods for high-throughput, unbiased discovery of indirect metabolite-protein connections. Continued ex-
istence of this knowledge gap represents a major issue for public health and the mission of the NIH because,
until it is filled, development of treatments for many diseases will remain largely intractable. Multi-omic analysis
of proteomes and metabolomes from the same system offers a promising path to discover hidden metabolic
pathways, but the requirement for human expert interpretation is a critical barrier that prevents complete value
extraction from multi-omic experiments. The long-term goal of the Meyer Research Group at Medical College of
Wisconsin is to reveal previously hidden metabolic pathways. The overall objective here, which is the first step
in realizing this vision, is to democratize multi-omic data collection and data interpretation, thereby increasing
the pace of metabolic pathway discovery. The central hypothesis is that artificial intelligence models can learn
to draw new metabolic connections between metabolites and proteins. This hypothesis is based on preliminary
data generated by the applicant and published literature, which shows how the strategy reveals known and new
connections between metabolites and proteins. The rationale for the proposed research is that unbiased, data-
driven discovery of new metabolic connections with AI algorithms (such as deep neural networks) will result in
new and innovative therapeutic targets that can be manipulated positively or negatively to prevent or treat dis-
ease. Guided by preliminary data and literature, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two complementary
focus areas: (1) multi-omic data integration, and (2) multi-omic data collection. The multi-omic data integration
focus uses AI models, already established as feasible in the applicant’s lab, to predict metabolite-protein inter-
actions. AI models will be optimized with existing public data, models will be validated with newly collected data,
and then novel metabolic connections will be validated using classic genetic and biochemical techniques. The
second focus area builds new, fast methods for multi-omic data collection to feed data into AI models, starting
from a recent advancement published by the applicant (Meyer et al., ChemRxiv 2020, accepted at Nature Meth-
ods). The applicant’s lab will further develop this method to quantify the full yeast proteome, and also extend the
method to enable multi-omic analysis on a single platform. This approach is innovative because it departs from
the status quo of slow multi-omic data interpretation requiring expert humans by building and validating a new,
automated AI method for metabolite pathway discovery. The multi-omic data collection focus is innovative be-
cause it departs from the status quo of slow multi-omic data collection requiring multiple platforms and hours per
sample by enabling unified multi-omic analysis in minutes. This contribution will be significant because ulti-
mately, the knowledge, validated methods, and resource datasets generated by this project will open new hori-
zons in drug development for diseases with altered metabolism, such as cancers and diabetes."
10914067,"Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC) is a devastating, frequently disfiguring, and often
fatal disease, expected to affect more than 53,000 people in the U.S. in 2020 and kill more than 10,000.
Prevention of this terrible disease is critical. Cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, and human papilloma
virus (HPV) are well established major causes of HNSCC; only smoking and alcohol consumption are
considered here. Cigarette smoking and alcoholic drinks are sources of multiple DNA adducts that are critical
in the carcinogenic process. This proposal will establish a liquid chromatography-nanoelectrospray ionization-
high resolution tandem mass spectrometry (LC-NSI-HRMS/MS) profile analysis of 12 oral cell DNA adducts
that are likely causes of HNSCC. This was inspired by our recent analysis of DNA adducts in oral cells, in
which we found levels more than 20 times higher in cigarette smokers than in non-smokers. These exciting
results encouraged us to propose a profile analysis of important carcinogen-derived DNA adducts in oral cells
according to the following specific aims:
1. Develop an LC-NSI-HRMS/MS profile analysis method for quantitation of 12 important and representative
 carcinogen and toxicant – DNA adducts in human oral cells and tissue. The adducts are derived from
 various carcinogens and DNA reactive compounds in cigarette smoke and alcoholic beverages.
2. Apply the profile analysis to oral cells from currently healthy individuals: a) 100 non-smokers who are non-
 drinkers or light drinkers; b) 100 cigarette smokers who are non-drinkers or light drinkers; and c) 100
 cigarette smokers who are moderate or heavy drinkers. Comparisons of adduct levels in groups a and b
 will identify adducts enhanced by cigarette smoking while comparisons of groups b and c will identify
 adducts that are enhanced by the combination of smoking and moderate or heavy drinking.
3. Test the longitudinal stability of the oral cell DNA adduct profile analysis over a 6 month period in 50
 smokers who are non-drinkers or light drinkers.
4. A) Determine the DNA adduct profile in oral cells collected from 75 smokers with HNSCC and compare to
 that in 200 smokers without HNSCC recruited in Specific Aim 2 with the goal of identifying an adduct profile
 that is characteristic of HNSCC incidence.
 B) Compare the oral cell DNA adduct profile from part A of this aim to that in tissue, both normal and
 tumor, in a subset of 60 patients from part A who undergo surgery, to determine whether oral cell DNA
 adduct patterns are consistent with those in tissue.
Our results will potentially identify individuals who are susceptible to HNSCC but are unable to quit smoking.
Once identified, aggressive lifestyle and monitoring interventions in these subjects such as oral examinations
2-4 times per year can be initiated for prevention or early detection of this disfiguring and often fatal cancer."
10912707,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The impact of stroke is shared between the stroke survivor and their spousal/partner caregiver (carepartner).
An estimated 30-50% of stroke survivors and carepartners experience depressive or anxiety symptoms that
negatively affect rehabilitation outcomes and quality of life. Yet, interventions to support couples post-stroke
are largely insufficient or inaccessible. To address this need, we developed a novel remotely-delivered dyadic
intervention to promote Resilience in Stroke survivor-carepartner Dyads (ReStoreD), in which couples learn
and practice goal-setting, communication strategies, and positive psychology activities like expressing
gratitude, finding meaning, and fostering connections. Preliminary pilot study results were promising, showing
reduced depressive symptoms and increased resilience in participants. The purpose of the current study is to
conduct a Stage II efficacy trial of the 8-week ReStoreD intervention with a sample of 200 dyads (n=400)
consisting of one individual who has sustained an ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke between 3 months and 3
years prior to enrollment and a cohabitating carepartner. Using a fully-powered, randomized waitlist-control
design, we will determine efficacy of ReStoreD to reduce emotional distress in both dyad members (Aim 1).
We will also examine effects of ReStoreD on secondary outcomes (resilience, relationship quality, stress-
related stroke, meaningful activity engagement) as potential mediators (Aim 2), and explore moderators to
determine whether certain subgroups respond better to the intervention (Aim 3). All participants will complete
standardized, validated assessments at baseline, 8 weeks, 16 weeks, and 6-month follow up. All aspects of the
study, including intervention activities and assessments, are conducted remotely, online.
This is the first rigorously designed efficacy trial to test a positive psychology intervention for stroke survivors
and their carepartners. When the aims of this study are realized, we will 1) have a remotely-delivered, dyadic
intervention to support couples post-stroke; 2) have a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the
intervention's effect on emotional distress, and can use this information to inform future interventions; and 3)
be able to identify a more specific target population for whom the intervention works best. Ultimately, if found
efficacious, this intervention will offer sustainable and accessible support for couples who are coping with
stroke to improve rehabilitation outcomes and quality of life."

The expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) in tumor-bearing hosts has emerged as a primary
mechanism to limit protective anti-tumor T cell responses and a major obstacle to the success of cancer
immunotherapy. It is therefore imperative to develop new effective therapeutic strategies to overcome the
immune restricting effects induced by MDSC in tumors. Our recent studies demonstrated that MDSC chronically
activate an integrated signaling network known as the unfolded protein responses (UPR) as a reaction to the
sustained and pronounced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induced by the precarious conditions of the tumor
microenvironment (TME). Also, conditional deletion of the UPR-related PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) functionally
reprogrammed MDSC into immunostimulatory cells that partially restore protective anti-tumor immunity in tumor
beds. Importantly, our new Preliminary Results demonstrate a compensatory accumulation of highly immune-
regulatory primary and secondary bile acids (BAs) in PERK-ablated MDSC in tumors. BAs are synthetized in the
liver and intestine as final products of cholesterol metabolism and signal through priming of farnesoid X receptor
(FXR) transcription factor, which was found increased in PERK-null MDSC and augmented MDSC suppressive
activity. Based on these crucial findings, we hypothesize that the accumulation of intracellular BAs restricts the
transformation of PERK-null MDSC in tumors into myeloid cells that promote sustained protective T cell immunity
through activation of FXR and a subsequent induction of the compensatory UPR mediators, IRE1→Xbp1. We
also propose that inhibition of PERK plus IRE1 will completely overcome MDSC-linked suppression in tumors
and synergize with T cell and checkpoint immunotherapies. We propose the following Specific Aims:
In Aim 1, we will determine the restrictive action of the accumulated BAs in the functional transformation of
PERK-null MDSC into myeloid cells that prime sustained protective anti-tumor T cell immunity.
In Aim 2, we will elucidate the mechanisms whereby BAs restrict PERKKO MDSC transformation in tumors.
In Aim 3, we will test the prediction that combined inhibition of PERK and IRE1 completely overcomes MDSC-
associated immunosuppression and enhances the effectiveness of cancer immunotherapy.
The metabolic mediators driving the immunosuppressive functionality of MDSC in tumor beds remain poorly
described. Thus, development of the Aims will have a profound impact on the field by substantiating a major
metabolic signal whereby tumors restrict the functional transformation of MDSC after targeting the ER stress
mediator, PERK. Also, our proposal will provide a mechanistic rationale for the development of novel therapeutic
approaches to entirely reprogram immunosuppressive myelopoiesis in tumor-bearing hosts, which is likely to
synergize with cancer immunotherapy and provide new biomarkers for tumor-MDSC reprogramming."

Our goal is to determine the molecular mechanisms of myosin-3 motors, unique kinase-myosin hybrids in the
myosin superfamily, that are involved in fundamental cellular processes including cargo transport and the
organization of the actin cytoskeleton in sensory cells. Despite their critical role in human biology, the molecular
mechanisms of myosin-3 motors are not well understood. We propose that different modes of regulation together
with different kinase substrates and binding partners determine the molecular mechanisms of myosin-3 motors.
An integrated and innovative biochemical, biophysical, cell biological and high-resolution structural approach will
be used to (i) determine the enzymatic profile and regulation, (ii) the unique structure (iii) and pathways that
control myosin-3 function and regulation in vitro and in cells. Collectively, these studies will reveal novel
mechanistic insights into the regulation of myosin-3 motors and have broad implications in the understanding of
how different myosins are tuned to organize actin networks in cells."
10914873,"PROJECT SUMMARY
More than 80% of childhood cancer survivors (CCS) develop serious or life-threatening late effects. Yet <20%
of CCS receive recommended survivorship care, despite the availability of consensus guidelines for lifelong
surveillance for late effects starting 2 years post-therapy. The “gold standard” cancer center-based survivorship
clinic provides high-quality care to CCS who attend, but patients avoid reminders of their past cancer and lack
knowledge and self-efficacy for survivorship care. Other barriers include travel distance, inadequate insurance,
and out-of-pocket costs—these structural issues contribute to health disparities. Partnering with community
primary care provider (PCP) clinics in a shared model of care is a promising strategy to overcome these barriers,
but PCPs lack knowledge, self-efficacy, and interactive communication with the cancer center and are confused
about the division of care responsibilities. Our intervention is scalable and distance-based, is informed directly
by patient and PCP barriers and preferences from previous studies, and is boosted by a nationwide explosion in
telehealth services precipitated by the COVID-19 crisis. The proposed randomized controlled trial will enroll 240
CCS 2.0-4.0 years post-chemotherapy/radiation to investigate an innovative multi-level intervention (i.e.,
interpersonal and organizational levels) consisting of 1) patient survivorship education via telehealth with the
cancer center, 2) ongoing patient-tailored education program within the EHR's patient portal, 3) a structured
interactive phone communication between the cancer center and the PCP clinic (with 1-year follow-up call), and
4) an in-person visit with the PCP clinic for survivorship care. The comparison group will be randomized to an
in-person visit with their cancer center survivorship clinic. This study includes 4 centers with high proportions of
subgroups vulnerable to survivorship care disparities (i.e., rural, Black, Latinx, Spanish-speaking,
socioeconomically disadvantaged). Both groups will be asked to begin recommended surveillance for late effects
within 1-year post-randomization, separate from tumor recurrence monitoring by the primary oncologist. Our
Specific Aims are to Aim 1- Demonstrate patient completion of guideline-recommended surveillance tests in
intervention participants is not inferior, i.e. within 10%, to that in the comparison group; Aim 2- Achieve greater
1) patient knowledge, self-efficacy, and activation and 2) PCP knowledge and self-efficacy with survivorship care
among intervention participants and their PCPs compared to the comparison group; and Aim 3- Ascertain
process outcomes for the 1) patient and 2) PCP clinic. Outcomes will also be assessed among subgroups with
survivorship care disparities. Transformative Impact: If our intervention demonstrates patient completion of
recommended survivorship care comparable to cancer center survivorship clinic, our study has the enormous
potential to deliver recommended lifelong care to a larger proportion of CCS and reduce survivorship care
disparities, while engaging patients and PCPs to integrate survivorship care as part of overall, lifelong health
maintenance."

Gold-standard quantitative imaging studies are often difficult to implement,
limited by financial and logistical issues, or expose the patient to unnecessary
risks. Deep learning has shown great promise in recent years for many medical
applications; one use is to synthesize improved images. Such image trans-
formation methods offer the potential to improve the quality, value, and
accessibility of medical imaging.
The goal of this project is to develop deep convolutional neural network
approaches to FDG PET imaging, the most commonly performed clinical brain-
focused PET study in the USA. Using simultaneous PET/MRI, we will train
networks to produce diagnostic PET images from ultra-low dose PET and MR
images. We will explore the three reimbursed clinical indications for this
imaging modality (tumor recurrence, dementia, and epilepsy) using both
quantitative metrics and repeated reader studies to assess equivalence and
evaluate possible AI generalization bias related to simultaneity, scanner type,
age, gender, and disease prevalence.
Next, we will evaluate whether we can move beyond ultra-low dose and remove
the radiation dose altogether, synthesizing FDG brain PET images from MR
inputs only, relying on the information in multi-modal functional MRI. Finally,
we will assess whether we can use deep networks to combine imaging and non-
imaging data such as clinical and genetic information to further improve image
transformation and predict future images and image-based biomarkers.
Significantly reducing or even eliminating the need for radiation to produce
brain FDG PET images would be truly transformative while the ability to
predict the future will enable personalized radiology and enhance our ability to
perform clinical trials."

An impressive feature of the nervous system is the specificity of its synaptic connections. Within the brain, a
single neuron is able to correctly identify and synapse onto its proper signaling partner over billions of other
neurons. How this degree of specificity is achieved is the subject of intense research. While great progress has
been made in identifying molecules that participate in long-range axon guidance and topographic positioning,
little is known in what molecules guide axons into their proper lamina once they reach their destined target region.
Through screening for extracellular matrix proteins differentially expressed by wide-field neurons in the
retinorecipient stratum griseum superficiale (SGS) of the superior colliculus (SC), I identified nephronectin (Npnt)
as a candidate for mediating synaptic specificity in retinotectal circuits. Npnt belongs to the EGF-like superfamily
of extracellular matrix glycoproteins and has been biochemically well-characterized to bind strongly and
specifically to integrin α8β1 (Itgα8β1).
My preliminary data show that 1) Npnt is exclusively expressed by wide-field neurons of the SC, whose cell
bodies define a lamina within the lower SGS; 2) Npnt deposits on the somata and proximal dendrites of wide-
field neurons, 3) loss of Npnt in the SGS results in ectopic αRGC axons within the upper SGS, and 4) alpha
retinal ganglion cells (αRGCs) express Itgα8β1
during development,
consistent with Itgα8β1 acting as the
receptor for Npnt on αRGCs. Taken altogether, I hypothesize that Npnt instructs αRGC axons to laminate within
the lower SGS through binding Itgα8β1 on αRGCs, thereby conferring synaptic specificity of αRGCs onto wide-
field neurons. This proposal will address how RGCs form precise connections to their neuronal partners within
the SC by studying how Npnt regulates axon laminar targeting and synapse formation. In Aim 1, I will determine
how Npnt mediates axon laminar targeting of αRGCs by focusing on its interactions with Itgα8β1. In Aim 2, I will
determine how Npnt affects αRGC synaptic partner choice within the SC. Completion of the proposed
experiments will reveal unique molecular and cellular mechanisms regarding the role of Npnt in specifying
neuronal pairing from αRGCs to wide-field neurons and will shed light on the function of Npnt in the mammalian
nervous system."

The broad goal of this competing renewal proposal is to strengthen the capacity for injury control research in
academic institutions in Ghana, building a cadre of qualified researchers, with growing collaborations among
West African countries. The project will increase capacity to generate evidence that will be translated into
effective activities and implementable policy across the spectrum of injury control.
The specific aims are:
 1. Develop and implement high-quality short, intermediate, and long-term training opportunities in injury
 control within Ghana and West Africa, to train future academic leaders in the field. We will provide 4 MPH
 degrees, 5 PhD degrees, and 3 post-doctoral fellowships (oriented for junior faculty) comprising 3 months
 of structured training and 2 years of mentored research. We will conduct 15 short (1-2 day) courses
 reaching over 500 participants and 20 distance learning sessions (1-2 hours) reaching over 1,000 West
 Africa-wide participants.
 2. Engage junior researchers in innovative, mentored research to generate evidence to strengthen the
 policy and practice of injury control in Ghana, West Africa, and low- and middle-income countries widely.
 3. Increase the capacity for injury control research at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and
 Technology (KNUST), and in other academic institutions, government agencies, and non-government
 organizations in Ghana. The number of KNUST departments that have at least one faculty member with
 MPH/PhD training with a focus on injury, with related publications, who are involved with international
 injury research networks, and who head experienced, accomplished research teams will increase from 4
 currently to 6. The number of such departments at University of Cape Coast and University of
 Development Studies will increase from 1 department currently to 2 each.
Training and research will address the spectrum of injury control (surveillance, prevention, care). This program
builds on a 30-year collaboration for injury research among KNUST, other institutions in Ghana, and the
University of Washington. The past 15 years have been under the auspices of the Fogarty TRAUMA program,
for which KNUST has been the prime recipient for the past 5 years. New plans for the coming cycle include: 1)
address injury problems that we have not yet addressed sufficiently, including drowning, violence, and injuries
to vulnerable populations (children, elderly); 2) increase emphasis on PhDs and junior faculty; 3) introduce
training and options for clinical trial research; and 4) found a multi-disciplinary Kumasi Injury Prevention Center
that will increase synergies among different KNUST departments and government agencies working in injury.
At the end of the project, scholars will have competed successfully for funding, contributed to a growing base
of policy-relevant research, and taken up faculty positions at institutions throughout Ghana and West Africa."
10827870,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Microneedles (MNs) are micron scale projections that allow for improved drug delivery through the skin via
formation of transient micropores. For successful transdermal drug delivery, it is crucial that the micropores
remain open (drug delivery ceases rapidly after micropore closure, usually within ~48 hrs). Delaying micropore
closure would be advantageous by allowing a longer period of drug delivery from each MN treatment. Previous
methods that have been explored for delaying micropore closure timeframes did not account for the
biochemical differences seen in diverse skin types; further, previous studies did not address the physiological
processes that impact micropore closure. We have shown that darker skin types have longer micropore
closure timeframes. This could result in altered therapeutic outcomes from unexpected drug delivery windows
in diverse skin types, which may be especially problematic for drugs with narrow therapeutic windows.
Catecholamines such as dopamine play a role in cutaneous wound healing and may mediate micropore
closure, but the direct role of dopamine in micropore closure has never been studied. Dopamine may alter
wound healing through dopamine receptor binding and subsequent cAMP modulation. Interestingly, melanin
production (responsible for skin color) also relies on the same dopaminergic precursors and alters intracellular
cAMP production. Therefore, we hypothesize that drug delivery through micropores in diverse skin types will
differ in a manner dependent upon micropore closure times, and variability in micropore closure among skin
types is influenced by dopamine secretion and receptor signaling. To test this, we will establish a translational
approach through two Aims. In Aim 1 we will assess the impact of differences in micropore closure times on
model drug absorption using a pharmacokinetic study. In Aim 2 we will investigate how dopamine D1/D2
receptor signaling alters microwound recovery using a dual in-vitro knockdown approach. The overall goal is to
identify a possible pharmaceutical target for delaying micropore closure, ultimately improving MN-assisted
transdermal drug delivery and informing development of better MN products for diverse populations."

Airway motile cilia play an important role in mucociliary clearance, the primary innate defense mechanism of
the lung, by propelling inhaled pathogens trapped in mucus up and out of the respiratory tract. Impaired ciliary
function is commonly found in patients with chronic pulmonary diseases, and genetic mutations that result in
aberrant cilia formation and loss of function often lead to the development of genetically heterogenous,
multisystem disorders called ciliopathies. The current body of literature suggests that the unique composition
and morphology of the ciliary membrane that envelopes the cilium are involved in maintaining cilia function and
homeostasis. However, the molecular players and mechanisms underlying the formation and maintenance of
the ciliary membrane remain poorly understood. The overarching objective of this proposal is to define the
physiological roles of the membrane-binding proteins ciBAR1 and 2 (formerly known as FAM92A and B) in
ciliogenesis and airway ciliated cell differentiation by using novel knockout mouse models. Both ciBAR proteins
possess a single Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain, which allows them to dimerize and form crescent-
shaped structures to preferentially sense and sculpt curved membranes. Previous studies have shown that
ciBAR1 and 2 bind to the ciliary protein Chibby1 (Cby1), which acts in preciliary vesicle recruitment and basal
body docking during early stages of ciliated cell differentiation. ciBAR 1 and 2 colocalize with Cby1 at the ciliary
base and play crucial roles in ciliogenesis, but their in vivo functions are currently unknown. The central
hypothesis of this proposal is that ciBAR1 and 2 play key roles in ciliogenesis and differentiation of
airway ciliated cells via their membrane-binding and shaping activity. To address this hypothesis, I will
use novel ciBAR1-/- and ciBAR2-/- knockout mouse models developed by our laboratory and propose the
following Specific Aims. In Aim 1, I will investigate if the loss of ciBAR1 or ciBAR2 in mice results in ciliary
defects in the trachea. In Aim 2, I will examine the roles of ciBAR proteins in formation and maintenance of
ciliary membranes during ciliogenesis using primary cell cultures, biochemical methods, and cell biological
approaches. Collectively, my proposed project will shed light on the in vivo functions of ciBAR1 and 2 in
ciliogenesis and airway ciliated cell differentiation and advance our existing knowledge of how the ciliary
membrane is generated and maintained throughout the process of ciliogenesis."
10925231,"Despite recent advances in both targeted therapy and immunotherapy, the overall survival (OS) for
metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) remains low. This renewal application is to continue our productive efforts to
develop a new tubulin inhibitor that can overcome drug resistance associated with FDA approved tubulin
inhibitors, and will therefore, increase OS in PCa and other types of cancers where anti-tubulin drugs are used.
 The support from the previous periods of funding has resulted in a new drug candidate, Veru-111, which is
under Phase 2 clinical trials for metastatic PCa. While Veru-111 is on a promising path to gain future FDA
approval, there are significant room for improvement. The goals of this renewal are: (1) to develop the next
generation of Veru-111 to proactively address its anticipated drug resistance; and (2) to develop targeted Veru-
111 drug conjugates to increase drug accumulation in prostate tumors and to target PCa bone metastasis.
 Aim 1. Develop a new generation of Veru-111, that can overcome both taxane resistance and the
anticipated Veru-111 resistance. Preliminary data: We have discovered a hybrid scaffold based on Veru-111
and Azixa, represented by SHIP-216, that can overcome resistances to both taxanes and Veru-111. Approaches:
Guided by high-resolution X-ray crystal structures, we will optimize the SHIP-216 scaffold to further improve its
potency and drug-like properties. New analogs will be evaluated against a panel of PCa cell lines, including both
taxane- and Veru-111-resistant cell lines to select the best five analogs for in vivo efficacy studies in Aim 3.
 Aim 2. Conjugate Veru-111 with PSMA targeting moieties to increase drug accumulation in PCa
tumors and conjugate Veru-111 with bisphosphonates for more efficacious targeting of bone metastasis.
Preliminary data: we have demonstrated Veru-111 itself can significantly reduce bone metastasis in a PDX model.
We have also developed linkers for conjugating Veru-111 with PSMA targeting moieties or bisphosphonates.
Approaches: we will optimize the length and composition of the linkers to PSMA targeting moieties and use
different bisphosphonates in conjugation, to generate focused sets of Veru-111 drug conjugates. These
conjugates will be first evaluated in vitro for stability and activation to select the best four conjugates (two in
PMSA and two in bisphosphonates conjugates) for further in vivo efficacy studies in Aim 3.
 Aim 3. We will determine the maximum tolerable dose (MTD), pharmacokinetics (PK), and in vivo
efficacy of the selected nine compounds from Aims 1-2 in both PCa cell line models and a PDX model to
select the overall best compound to support subsequent clinical trials in the Veru-111 portfolio.
Preliminary data: we have already shown that SHIP-216 as a new Veru-111 analog is highly efficacious against
multiple xenograft models, including the 22Rv1 PCa and the Veru-111 resistant DU-145/VxR PCa models.
Approaches: We will evaluate all selected new compounds for their designed ability to treat prostate tumors
using both cell line and PDX models in vivo."

Current techniques for measuring the physiological or psychological effects of obesity, and in particular bariatric
surgery, either lack sensitivity, are invasive, or require expensive specialized devices. For measuring the
physiological effects, BMI is commonly used to
diagnose obesity despite the known shortcomings as a marker
for metabolic syndrome. Biomarkers such as anthropometric measurements (e.g., waist-to-hip ratio) and visceral
adipose tissue (VAT) have been shown to be superior to BMI in predicting health risks associated with obesity,
but these measures lack sensitivity, specificity, or are expensive. Another key morbidity associated with obesity
is non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The gold standard to the
diagnosis and assessment of these conditions is histologic evaluation of liver biopsies. Fibroscan transient
elastography is a noninvasive test which can also assess fibrosis, but high BMI and severe steatosis can
decrease its accuracy. These approaches are either invasive, expensive, or relatively inaccurate. Measures of
self-body perception are commonly used to assess psychological aspects of obesity, as body image is an
important motivator for diet, physical activity, and weight loss intention. Body image perception is commonly
assessed using self-reports and cartoon-like line drawings which are non-subject specific and insensitive.
Based on our preliminary work (R21HL124443) that developed optical body scanning technology to capture 3D
body shapes using inexpensive hardware, we propose to use the technology to study the physiological and
psychological effects on subjects with severe obesity:
 · Develop prediction algorithm for hepatic steatosis, fibrosis, adiposity, and blood biomarkers using optical
 scans. The optical scan and biopsy data will be used as the training and validation set to develop a
 machine learning algorithm to cheaply and non-invasively predict the biomarkers from 3D body surface
data.
 · Develop the use of optical scans for measuring the physiological effects of obesity. We will conduct a
 cross sectional and longitudinal study to further assess the use of optical surface scans to determine
 health indicators associated with obesity (using data from surface scan, DXA and serum biomarkers) for
 one year following surgery. We will establish a database of such data along with software for data mining
 the database.
 · Develop the use of optical scans for measuring the psychological effects of obesity. We will collect 3D
 surface geometry of each subject using optical scans and morph these to produce subject-specific
images of larger or smaller body shape. We will use these images to study perception related to obesity
and in particular patients undergoing post-operative body changes"

Osteosarcoma is the most common primary bone tumor of adolescents and young adults.
Aggressive surgery and intensive chemotherapy provide long term survival to up to 75% of
patients diagnosed with localized disease, but this approach only cures 20% of patients who
present with metastasis. Numerous attempts at treatment intensification have failed to improve
this dismal prognosis, so there is an urgent need for new treatment approaches based on a
deeper understanding of osteosarcoma biology. The Wnt signaling pathway has been a focus of
investigation in osteosarcoma because of its role in normal bone biology. Canonical, β-catenin-
dependent Wnt signaling drives normal osteoblast differentiation. It has been reported that the
secreted inhibitor of canonical Wnt (cWnt) signaling, Dickkopf-1 (DKK-1) is found at high levels in
the blood of newly diagnosed osteosarcoma patients and is preferentially expressed by
osteosarcoma cells at the invasive edge of growing tumors. Inhibition of DKK-1 increases
noncanonical Wnt (ncWnt) signaling in murine osteosarcoma cells. Our laboratory demonstrated
that human DKK-1 can be detected in the blood of immune deficient mice bearing osteosarcoma
patient-derived xenografts and that a neutralizing antibody against DKK-1 increased cWnt
signaling in the primary tumor, inducing markers of differentiation and abolishing metastasis.
Taken together, these findings suggest the hypothesis that DKK-1 regulates the balance between
cWnt and ncWnt signaling in OS, affecting expression of genes important for tumor cell
differentiation and metastasis. We will test this hypothesis and generate preclinical data to guide
the implementation of treatments targeting DKK-1 in osteosarcoma patients through three specific
aims. SA1: To define the mechanism by which DKK-1 regulates the balance between cWnt and
ncWnt signaling in osteosarcoma. SA2: To optimize the timing and implementation of DKK-1
inhibition in preclinical models of osteosarcoma. SA3: To validate serum DKK-1 level as a
biomarker of disease burden and response to therapy in osteosarcoma patients. Successful
completion of this study will better define the role of Wnt signaling in OS biology, provide robust
preclinical data to inform a clinical trial of DKK-1 targeted therapy to prevent OS metastasis, and
develop a novel, noninvasive biomarker of relapse risk and response to treatment."

occur in many types of human cancer, including lung cancer, non- Hodgkin lymphomas, Spitzoid
melanocytic lesions, neuroblastoma and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor. In over 80% of pediatric
anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), the most common form of mature T cell lymphoma in this population,
the chromosomal aberration t(2;5)(p23;q35) results in the expression of the constitutively active tyrosine
kinase NPM-ALK. NPM-ALK positive lymphoma has served as a model for understanding ALK-mediated
oncogenesis and development of targeted therapies, thus NPM-ALK related studies carry profound
implications for the cancer field in general. Unfortunately, even with current intensive combined
chemotherapy, approximately 30% of patients experiences disease progression or recurrence within two
years of treatment. However, clinical or genetic factors that cause ALCL relapse are not known.
Furthermore, prognostic biomarkers that can be easily obtained using non-invasive methods have not been
clearly defined in patients receiving targeted therapies in ALCL. Our central hypothesis is that sensitive and
specific quantitative assessment of circulating NPM-ALK transcript using digital droplet (dd)PCR in
conjunction with plasma levels of ALK auto- antibody will serve as unique disease-specific biomarkers that
will provide an opportunity for assessment of response to therapy and lead to prognostic biomarkers that
may identify patients with high risk for relapse. Using plasma samples from uniformly treated patients
enrolled in a Children's Oncology Group (COG) Phase II study of Brentuximab Vedotin and Crizotinib with
newly diagnosed ALCL, we address our hypothesis through the following specific aims: 1) Determine the
utility of ddPCR for minimal disease detection and disease monitoring in ALK+ ALCL, 2) Determine the
prognostic utility of anti-ALK immune response in ALK+ ALCL 3) Investigate the prognostic significance of a
multivariate model combining ddPCR and immune response to ALK in patients with ALK+ ALCL. The
development of sensitive and precise assessment of minimal disseminated disease and/or minimal residual
disease will play an important role in management of patients with ALK+ ALCL and facilitate decisions about
discontinuation of treatment and identifying patients at risk of relapse/progression."

Senescence is implicated in many human diseases and the elimination of senescent cells in model organisms
slows, and in some cases reverses many diseases. These findings raise hope that a detailed mechanistic
understanding of senescence will lead to novel therapies to treat human disease. Despite the importance of
cellular senescence, we lack robust methods to identify, isolate, and manipulate senescent cells. New
approaches and technologies position our team to comprehensively identify senescent cells. This, in turn, will
enable in-depth analyses of biomarkers, spatial distribution, behavior, and function of senescent cells across
human tissues and time in a high throughput manner. The primary goal for the Biological Analysis Core (BAC)
within Washington University Senescence Mapping Center (WU-SN-TMC) is to generate multi-omics and
imaging data to build high resolution, multi-dimensional atlases of cellular senescence across tissue types and
lifespan to facilitate basic and translational research. Although senescent cells are tracked by several known
markers, it is increasingly clear that not all senescent cells express the same set of markers and the usefulness
of individual senescent markers may be limited. Static universal tissue agnostic senescence markers may not
exist. Instead, there are likely dynamic senescence signatures (gene expression patterns anchored by frequent,
but unobligated presence of some of the “known” markers and others yet to be identified), that may differ with
cell type, age, and environmental stimuli. We propose using cutting edge enabling technologies at necessary
scale, depth, and resolution to identify such signatures while mapping senescent cells in various tissue
environments at different ages. We will map senescent cells and their associated phenotypes in four tissues
(bone marrow, breast, liver, and colon), chosen for their clinical importance, diversity, relevance to
senescence, and availability. We will utilize the highly successful infrastructure we have developed for several
large-scale projects as a springboard, combined with in-house expertise in senescence research, to generate
cellular senescence atlases with transcriptome-wide coverage, single cell resolution, and spatial registration.
We will use our experience in single cell omics to establish a comprehensive epigenetic and transcriptomic
landscape in targeted tissues. We will add the spatial dimension to build 2D and 3D molecular atlases by
incorporating spatial transcriptomics, CODEX, and light sheet microscopy. We will also use proteomics to study
the biomarkers and secretome of senescent cells. To validate our results, we will use established and newly
developed mouse models to track senescent cells at different ages with or without perturbations. These studies
will allow us to improve detection methods for senescent cells and validate biomarker signatures identified in
human studies. BAC will work closely with the other Cores within WU-SN-TMC to produce multi-dimensional
molecular and cellular senescence tissue atlases at unprecedented cellular resolution and gene coverage with
the highest efficiency possible."

The ITCH ubiquitin E3 ligase has been well characterized as a key molecule in immune cells. The roles of
ITCH in tumorigenesis are rather controversial due to its versatile functions in both tumor and immune cells.
Therefore, an in-depth characterization of ITCH in tumorigenesis considering both tumor and immune cells is
warranted to fill the gap in our current knowledge of ITCH’s function in cancer. We recently reported an
oncogenic function of ITCH through promoting BRAF activation in BRAF wild-type melanoma cells. Our newly
obtained preliminary results unveil a multifaceted role of ITCH in melanoma cells by modulating CRAF and
other oncogenic signals. Our results also suggest an immunosuppressive function of ITCH in the melanoma
tumor immune microenvironment. Based on these data, we hypothesize that in BRAF wild-type melanoma
cells, ITCH is a therapeutic vulnerability in both melanoma cells and the tumor immune microenvironment. In
melanoma cells, ITCH sustains oncogenic pathways including RAF-MEK-ERK and others to maintain their
fitness; activation of ITCH in immune cells, on the other hand, fosters an immunosuppressive tumor
microenvironment. Hence targeting ITCH could be a novel strategy to alter the cancer-immune set point. Three
aims are proposed to test our hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will define how K27-linked ubiquitination of RAF
proteins by ITCH modulates MEK-ERK signaling. We will characterize if ITCH facilitates the atypical
ubiquitination and subsequent activation of CRAF in a similar way to BRAF, especially in the cellular contexts
where CRAF plays a central role in activating MEK-ERK signals. Moreover, we will determine if the B55-PP2A
phosphatase functions as the reader protein for the poly-ubiquitin chains assembled on RAF proteins to
remove the inhibitory N-terminal phosphorylations. In Aim 2, we will characterize RAF-independent oncogenic
functions of ITCH. We will examine if ITCH facilitates the activation of other oncogenic pathways that fulfill its
pro-survival and pro-metastatic roles. In Aim 3, we will focus on investigating both melanoma cell-autonomous
and non-autonomous functions of ITCH in vivo. We will dissect these roles by using several mouse melanoma
models. To define if ITCH creates an immunosuppressive microenvironment, mouse syngeneic melanoma
models will be generated using Itch+/+ and Itch-/- mice, and immuno-profiling will be carried out to search for the
underlying mechanism(s). Further, Itch+/+ and Itch-/- mice will be crossed with well-characterized murine
melanoma models to assess its roles in both the tumor cell and immune microenvironment."

We propose to continue our established Genomics Data Analysis Center for the analysis of
structural variants in cancer, including somatic copy-number alterations (SCNAs) and
rearrangements, addressing the Copy Number competency required by GDAN. We also add
capabilities to analyze long- and linked-read data, addressing a second competency. We led
SCNA analyses throughout The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the first iteration of the
Genomics Data Analysis Network (GDAN). We also co-led the Structural Variations Working
Group of the International Cancer Genome Consortium Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes
(PCAWG). For these efforts, we have developed a large suite of tools and deep expertise
covering all aspects of analysis of SVs in cancer. Specifically, we will accomplish five Aims: In
Aims 1 and 2, we will determine SCNA and rearrangement profiles from either short-read (whole
exome or whole genome) or long-/linked-read sequencing data, and determine germline
genotypes, parental haplotypes, and ancestry groups. The haplotype information will be used to
improve our copy-number resolution. In Aim 3, we reconstruct the tumor genome and its
evolutionary history. We evaluate sample heterogeneity including tumor purity, ploidy, and
subclonal alterations, and phase rearrangements to homologous chromosomes—determining
somatic distances between all pairs of loci. Using these data, we determine mechanisms of DNA
damage and repair and infer the events that occurred over tumor evolution. In Aim 4, we integrate
data across samples to identify SVs and genomic loci that impact tumor evolution, detect
associations with other molecular and clinical features, and evaluate potential SCNA-determined
subclasses. Moreover, we perform association and admixture analyses with the germline
genotypes detected in Aim 1. In Aim 5, we indicate ways in which we will immerse ourselves
within the GDAN and disseminate our analysis results both within the GDAN and to the wider
community. Within this, we offer secondary competencies in single-cell and circulating DNA
analysis. Our GDAC will provide a comprehensive analysis of the roles of structural variations in
cancer development and progression through treatment among GDAN samples. We will also
optimize interactions with the wider GDAN and scientific community to make maximal use of these
data."

Vaccines are powerful tools for combating infectious diseases yet vaccination may fail to induce robust
antibody responses, even after multiple doses. Yet 2-10% of all vaccinations in healthy people fail to result in
protective immunity, and, in the specific example of hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine, chronic inflammatory
states such as obesity are associated with 10-30% of individuals having poor antibody responses, leaving
them unprotected. Moreover, the prevalence of chronic inflammatory states such as obesity is steadily
increasing worldwide, at a time where we more than ever depend on vaccines to prevent infectious diseases
such as COVID-19. Better understanding of mechanisms of poor humoral responses to vaccines are urgently
needed. Vaccine responses involve induction of affinity-matured antibodies by B cells, which requires help
from T follicular helper (Tfh) CD4 cells in germinal centers. We previously identified circulating Tfh, termed
cTfh, which provided help to B cells in vitro and had transcriptional and phenotypic similarities to lymphoid Tfh,
and responded to influenza vaccination in an antigen-specific way, giving us a “window” into lymphoid state
and activity. However, understanding of how cTfh and B cell responses to HBV vaccine are established and
change over time are limited, particularly in humans. Here, we propose to study the HBV vaccine response to
understand factors associated with the strength of the protective antibody response, using a systems
immunology approach in a prospective clinical study of HBV vaccination in the setting of chronic inflammation
induced by obesity. In Aim 1, we will evaluate the effect of repeated antigen exposure by studying the Tfh-B
cell axis longitudinally for phenotype and repertoire, in order to determine which characteristics are most
predictive of the final antibody response. In Aim 2, we will compare subjects receiving adjuvanted HBV vaccine
to those receiving traditional HBV vaccine to determine how the cTfh and B cell responses differ due to
adjuvant, using multi-modality single cell profiling. Finally, in Aim 3, we will test mechanisms of how chronic
inflammation in the host affects the HBV vaccine response by performing direct lymph node biopsies for
multiplex immunofluorescence studies. Together, these experiments will explore the effects of repeated
antigen exposure, adjuvants, and chronic inflammation on the cTfh-B cell axis and suggest future strategies for
improved vaccine design."

 This application, in response to RFA-CA-004 “Research Answers to National Cancer Institute's (NCI)
Provocative Questions (R01 Clinical Trial Optional),” will address “PQ2: How does intermittent fasting
affect cancer incidence, treatment response, or outcome?”
 Obesity and age are two major risk factors for cancer development. Thus, therapeutic interventions that
prevent or delay the development of excessive weight gain and/or age-associated physiological dysfunction hold
great promise for reducing cancer risk in the increasingly obese and elderly global population. One such
intervention is time-restricted eating (TRE), a pragmatic form of intermittent fasting in which daily caloric intake
is constrained to a consistent window of 8–12 hours without explicitly reducing total caloric intake. In young male
mice, time-restricted feeding (TRF) reduces cancer risk by preventing obesity and metabolic diseases. TRF has
also been shown to reduce breast cancer xenograft progression in obese mice. In humans, short-term clinical
studies of TRE have revealed metabolic improvements that predict reduced cancer risk, and epidemiological
evidence suggests that prolonged nightly fasting can reduce the risk of cancer, independent of changes in body
weight. This promising preliminary evidence suggests that TRE may be an effective intervention for reducing
cancer risk. However, the effects of TRF in aged animals and in the context of an obesogenic Western diet have
not yet been established, and the mechanisms by which TRF reduces cancer risk remain unknown. This
application builds upon promising preliminary data and leverages the complementary skills of the research team
to address these critical gaps in knowledge. Both obesity and aging are associated with mitochondrial
dysfunction and the production of pro-tumorigenic mitochondrial metabolites. Proposed experiments test the
hypothesis that TRF optimizes mitochondria function through both cell-autonomous and systemic mechanisms,
thereby reducing cancer risk. In Aim 1, the impact of TRF on mitochondria function and related physiologies will
be established in aged mice. Nutrient metabolism, energy consumption, and mitochondria function will be
assessed in these mice. In Aim 2, an innovative combination of metabolomics and mitochondria respiration
assays will be used to test the impact of TRF on mitochondria function in normal and cancer cells (assessing
both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous mechanisms). The effects of TRF on tumor incidence will be
assessed by subjecting tumor-prone mice to TRF. In Aim 3, plasma collected from a recently concluded human
TRE intervention study will be used to test the effect of TRE on mitochondria function and cancer risk in humans.
The proposed comparative analysis of TRE in humans and mice will provide critical mechanistic insight into how
one form of intermittent fasting can help prevent cancer onset and improve treatment outcomes."

Deimplementing overused health interventions is an essential step in maximizing quality and minimizing waste
in the United States health care system. Acute bronchiolitis is a common lung disease of young children
caused by respiratory viral infection. Continuous pulse oximetry monitoring in hospitalized infants with
bronchiolitis who are not receiving supplemental oxygen is an overused intervention that has persisted despite
evidence that it is ineffective in this population and may cause harm. Three national guidelines now discourage
continuous pulse oximetry monitoring in hospitalized infants with bronchiolitis who are not receiving
supplemental oxygen. In preliminary studies, the investigators showed that continuous pulse oximetry overuse
occurs in nearly half of all hospitalized infants with bronchiolitis for whom there is no monitoring indication, and
there is high between-hospital variability in overuse. The overarching goal of the applicants is to determine
which strategies are most effective for deimplementing overused health interventions that have the potential to
harm children. The overall objective of this application is to conduct the Eliminating Monitor Overuse (EMO)
SpO2 trial, a hybrid type III effectiveness-deimplementation trial with a longitudinal cluster-randomized design
in 32 Pediatric Research in Inpatient Settings Network hospitals. The trial will test an unlearning
deimplementation strategy (educational outreach with audit & feedback) vs. a combined unlearning +
substitution deimplementation strategy (adding an electronic health record-integrated clinical pathway) on
sustainability of continuous pulse oximetry monitoring deimplementation in children with bronchiolitis who are
not receiving supplemental oxygen. This proposal includes three Specific Aims: (1) Compare the effects of the
unlearning only strategy versus the unlearning + substitution strategy on deimplementation outcomes, (2)
Identify deimplementation strategy mechanisms linked to penetration and sustainability using mixed methods,
and (3) Examine the effects of deimplementation on clinical outcomes and unintended consequences. This
approach is innovative because it focuses on the under-researched area of pediatric deimplementation, the
experimental design reflects state-of-the-art theoretical framing of deimplementation interventions, and the
primary outcome focuses on long-term sustainability of deimplementation, which is highly relevant to the
public. The proposed research is significant because it will advance the science of health care delivery for a
high incidence pediatric lung disease that hospitalizes 100,000 children annually, acute viral bronchiolitis. The
trial will also provide new insights into the processes, mechanisms, costs, and outcomes of large, rigorously-
designed deimplementation efforts."

Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a devastatingly progressive disease with median survival of 2-4 years
post diagnosis. Three decades of research and over 20 clinical trials have resulted in only two approved
treatments for IPF: pirfenidone and nintedanib. While both drugs slow disease progression, there are
differences in treatment response for individual IPF patients and neither drug is curative suggesting that IPF
may arise from different pathologic pathways resulting in disease heterogeneity. Drug development in IPF is
hampered by poor patient phenotyping and a lack of tools to assess disease activity and early treatment
response. As a result, clinical trials require large numbers of subjects to observe real efficacy signals.
Multimodal molecular imaging offers to accelerate drug development and ultimately change IPF management.
Molecular imaging of specific targets can stratify subjects, assess drug-target engagement and guide dose
optimization for a new drug designed to bind to that target. Molecular imaging also can assess disease activity
and monitor response to therapy. A comprehensive multimodal molecular imaging protocol would thus improve
the probability for clinical trial success with smaller patient numbers in a shorter period of time.
We propose to use multimodal imaging of αvβ3 integrin and oxidized collagen in mouse models of lung fibrosis
to evaluate αvβ3 antagonism as a route to pathway-specific intervention. αvβ3 is implicated as a regulator of
IPF development with αvβ3 expression elevated in preclinical models and in the lungs of IPF patients.
Treatment with αvβ3 antagonists leads to reduction of lung fibrosis and enhanced survival in preclinical models
of pulmonary fibrosis and several antagonists are entering clinical trials for IPF. The positron emission
tomography (PET) probe 18F-FPP-RGD2 was used to image αvβ3 in (pre-)clinical studies of cancer. To assess
disease activity, we’ve developed the allysine-binding magnetic resonance (MR) probe Gd-CHyd which reports
on the oxidized collagen formed during fibrogenesis. We showed that imaging oxidized collagen predicts
disease activity and treatment response. Because oxidized collagen is fundamental to fibrogenesis, Gd-CHyd
can quantify pulmonary disease activity independent of cause and can be used generally to measure response
to treatment. We will develop and optimize a multimodal 18F-FPP-RGD2 PET and Gd-CHyd MR imaging
protocol in mouse models of pulmonary fibrosis, then use this to noninvasively quantify αvβ3 expression and
fibrogenesis through the course of disease progression with validation by ex vivo measurements. We will then
apply the protocol to confirm target engagement of an αvβ3 antagonist, determine optimal therapeutic dose,
and use Gd-CHyd MR to measure therapeutic response. We hypothesize that molecular imaging will allow pre-
clinical assessment of target relevance while simultaneously assessing disease activity and response to target
inhibition, all of which will accelerate successful drug development for IPF."

Intracortical brain-computer interfaces (iBCIs) can restore lost function for people with severe
speech and motor impairment (SSMI) due to neurological injury or disease. Despite tremendous
recent progress, iBCI performance remains well below that of able-bodied people. In prior NIH-
supported research, our collaborative team developed a high-performance intracortical brain-
computer interface (iBCI) that decodes arm movement intentions directly from brain activity.
This technology has allowed people with SSMI to control a computer cursor with sufficient
speed and accuracy to type at up to 8 words/min and has enabled full control of unmodified
consumer devices using only decoded motor cortical activity. In the proposed U01 clinical
research, we will take an important next step for the field: investigating neural ensemble
encoding during complex tasks that only people are capable of performing (i.e., moving arbitrary
combinations of limbs and body parts, and handwriting). This work will build upon decades of
experience in studying the motor system in humans and non-human primates, with the end goal
of advancing iBCI technology, and will be performed as part of the multi-site BrainGate
consortium. We propose to study in detail, at 'coarse' and 'fine' scales, how the Precentral
Gyrus (PCG; “motor cortex”) generates complex movements. We will base our investigations on
two new key discoveries from our lab: 1) that a small area of the PCG encodes movements of
all 4 limbs in a ‘compositional’ way, allowing differentiation of separate limb and movement
encoding dimensions, and 2) that complex, dexterous movements such as handwriting can be
accurately decoded from the PCG of people with paralysis. The results of these detailed
fundamental neuroscience studies will enable us to then design and demonstrate two entirely
new iBCIs: a system for helping restore continuous motion of the entire body in virtual reality
(‘Whole-Body iBCI') and a system to substantially increase on-screen text generation speed
(‘Handwriting iBCI’). Finally, we will continue to evaluate the safety profile of Utah-array based
iBCIs through the ongoing BrainGate2 pilot clinical trial, with particular emphasis on critical
neuroethics considerations. Upon completion, this project will advance both the capabilities of
iBCIs for restoration of lost function and our understanding of the detailed neural mechanisms of
complex movements."

PROJECT SUMMARY
Rheumatic diseases are heterogeneous in phenotypes, kinetics of events and trajectory, and
response to therapy. Defining relatively homogenous disease subgroups can foster identification
of patients who share underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms, risks of complications and
response to distinct therapeutic strategies – thereby laying a critical foundation for developing
precision medicine approaches to the rheumatic diseases. As approaches that utilize multiple
clinical and biologic characteristics to subgroup patients will likely improve our predictive
capability, it is critical to harness tools and technologies that allow aggregation and harmonization
of multiple streams data. Johns Hopkins Medicine has built a system for big data capture,
aggregation and harmonization. This tool, known as the Precision Medicine Analytics Platform,
captures high quality longitudinal data including deeper phenotypic data at the point of care,
granular results from diagnostic systems and measurements from outside the health care
environment. In this proposal, we seek to bring these tools and technologies to our rheumatology
subspecialty centers in Lupus, Vasculitis, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Psoriatic Arthritis, Scleroderma,
Myositis, Sjogren’s syndrome, Lyme, and Cancer Immune-Related Adverse Events to accelerate
research in the rheumatic diseases. The Specific Aims of the Precision Medicine Data Integration
Core are to: 1) facilitate and accelerate research study implementation, while ensuring stringent
research ethics and data security practices; and 2) transform data collection methods to harness
institutional “big data,” improve efficiency and enable remote study progress. The Core is led by

The broad goal of the Data Science Core (DSC) is to advance and apply modern data science
methods to support the practice of precision medicine in rheumatology. We define precision
medicine as discovering mechanistically anchored and clinically relevant disease subgroups for
which optimal strategies can be followed. The precision medicine statistical methods we
develop and apply will improve the clinical assessment of an individual's disease status,
trajectory, and likely benefits of competing interventions and thereby benefit people living with
rheumatic diseases. During the past funding period, a team led by P30 PI Antony Rosen and
DSC Director Scott Zeger, designed and implemented the JH Precision Medicine Analytics
Platform (PMAP), a cloud-based data system: (1) receives a nightly download of all JHM clinical
data and projects the data into a secure clinical cohort database; (2) provides an environment
for collaborative, modern statistical analyses; and (3) provides tools to visualize from within the
Electronic Medical Record those analytic results relevant to a particular patient's decisions.
PMAP has already been implemented in the Scleroderma and Myositis Center. During the
coming period, PMAP will become active in each rheumatology Center of Excellence so that
current clinical cohort databases will form the information foundation for the next phase of this
P30 program. This novel infrastructure makes it possible for the DSC to develop and apply
novel statistical tools that identify disease subgroups, for whom optimal treatments can be
evaluated. In this way, JHM Rheumatology will discover the key data science tools required by a
learning healthcare system.
The Specific Aims of the Data Science Core are to: (1) provide study design and analysis
support that enables investigators to generate, manage, analyze, and interpret complex data
using modern statistical and computing methods; (2) develop and apply multivariate hierarchical
models (MHMs) to longitudinal datasets to identify patient subsets predictive of disease
trajectories and major clinical events; and (3) apply modern statistical analytic approaches to
observational and experimental studies that rigorously estimate treatment efficacy and safely,
acknowledging the likely heterogeneity among individuals in their responses to treatments and
the potential biases inherent in using observational data to address causal questions."
10914788,"Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness that is due to degeneration of retinal ganglion cells
(RGCs) and their axons. Biomechanical stability of the optic nerve head (ONH) which is composed of the
lamina cribrosa (LC) and peripapillary sclera (PPS) and is rich in elastic fibers, has been postulated to play an
important role in maintaining normal function of RGC axons. In our previous grant cycle, stemming from our
initial discovery of a glaucoma-causing mutation in a microfibril-related gene, ADAMTS10, we focused on
microfibrils and established their important role in glaucoma pathogenesis. Microfibrils are primarily composed
of fibrillin-1 (encoded by FBN1) and required for proper elastic fiber assembly, contributing to their
biomechanical properties. Elastin undergoes crosslinking by Lysyl Oxidase Like 1 (encoded by LOXL1),
another key element for proper elastic fiber formation. Mice lacking LOXL1 (Loxl1-/-) develop pelvic floor organ
prolapse (POP) due to malformation of elastic fibers, demonstrating the essential role of LOXL1 in normal
elastic fiber formation. Our preliminary data with Loxl1-/- mice demonstrated ocular pathologies, including
abnormal biomechanics as determined by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and ultrastructural changes of
collagens and elastic fibers in the PPS. A landmark study discovered the association of LOXL1 genomic
variants with exfoliation glaucoma (XFG) caused by exfoliation syndrome (XFS) which is a disease with
systemic manifestations of elastic fiber defects, including higher prevalence of POP. The association of LOXL1
with XFG/XFS has been replicated in many populations, however, it is also recognized that while defective
LOXL1 is necessary, it is not sufficient to cause disease, suggesting that other factors must be involved. We
hypothesize that microfibrils are a key additional factor, in part because of their indispensable role for proper
formation of elastic fibers. Our central hypothesis is that alterations in the biomechanics and structure of the
ONH caused by defective elastic fibers result in RGC axon pathology. This hypothesis suggests that directly
targeting biomechanical abnormalities may prove to be an effective novel treatment for glaucoma patients. To
test our hypotheses, we will use our newly created double mutant (Fbn1C1039G/+/Loxl1-/-) and Loxl1-/- mice to
investigate biomechanical and ultrastructural changes caused by elastic fiber defects in SA 1 and to determine
the effect of these changes on RGC axon pathology relevant to glaucoma in SA 2. Based on the findings, we
will test the effectiveness of targeting biomechanical abnormalities for protection against RGC axon pathology.
Success of this investigation would provide mechanistic insight into the role of biomechanics of the ONH in
glaucoma and, more importantly, it would lead to a much-needed novel treatment approach for glaucoma
patients."

 RNA plays a central role in many gene-regulatory processes and is viewed as an important drug target.
Riboswitches are natural RNA sensors typically found in bacterial mRNAs where they bind cognate metabolites.
This process elicits riboswitch conformational changes that control expression of downstream genes. Although
most riboswitches bind only a single ligand, we discovered that the Type I preQ1-I (class I) riboswitch recognizes
two metabolites, leading to positive cooperativity that extends the riboswitch’s preQ1-sensing range in bacterial
cells. The discovery that a small, single-domain RNA can bind two metabolites is unprecedented in the field. The
importance of this discovery is heightened by the fact that the Type I sub-class is the most prominent preQ1-
sensing riboswitch in the biosphere and exists in many human pathogens. Surprisingly, cooperative binding by
the Type I preQ1-I riboswitch has gone undetected for more than a decade — until now. The overarching goal of
this proposal is to define the underlying molecular attributes that confer cooperativity and its interplay with preQ1-
sensing during bacterial gene regulation. To address this challenge, we developed innovative tools including: (i)
adaptation of a bacterial reporter assay in which the Type I preQ1 riboswitch controls GFPuv expression, which
revealed two EC50 values for preQ1 binding; (ii) development of software for analysis of cooperative isothermal
titration calorimetry (ITC) data, which yields microscopic binding constants whose ratio quantifies cooperativity;
and (iii) refinement of our GFPuv reporter coupled in cell (ReCo-ic)SHAPE (selective 2´-hydroxyl acylation
analyzed by primer extension) assay to pinpoint functionally-relevant, preQ1-dependent riboswitch conformations
in live bacteria. These approaches form a rigorous foundation to define the chemical determinants of cooperative
ligand binding and to evaluate their effects on biological function. We will address our central goal in three aims:
(1) Determine crystal structures of Type I preQ1 riboswitches in apo and bound states; (2) Define riboswitch
chemical attributes that confer cooperative binding and evaluate their role in bacterial gene regulation; and (3)
Define gene-regulatory conformational changes using ReCo-icSHAPE in concert with all-atom computational
approaches to delineate cooperative binding pathways. We are a team of experts with strong records in: RNA
crystallography, effector binding, RNA chemical modification and bacterial reporter assays (Wedekind, P.I.); RNA
dynamics and computational prediction of RNA structure using experimental restraints (Mathews, co-I); next-
generation sequencing (Pritchett, collaborator); and biophysical approaches (Jenkins, collaborator). Given our
novel premise, expertise and team synergy, we are uniquely qualified to perform this work. High-value outcomes
include a new structural and chemical understanding of cooperative binding by the smallest natural riboswitch
aptamer, which we hypothesize is a hallmark of the entire Type I sub-class. Overall, the proposed analysis will
broaden our understanding of RNA-mediated gene regulation, which has implications for antibacterial targeting."

Rhode Island (RI) has substantial health and healthcare resources, but also substantial and serious healthcare
problems, including high rates of overdose death, mental health problems, obesity, and significant health care

health and health care problems requires that critical gaps in the state’s Clinical and Translational Research
(CTR) infrastructure be closed. During Phase I of Advance-CTR, the Professional Development (PD) Core
focused on three specific gaps faced by researchers and their teams: insufficient research funding, limited
opportunities to learn state-of-the-art skills required for CTR, and lack of access to effective and experienced
mentoring. To bolster funding, the Core funded ten Mentored Research Awards (MRAs), and all ten will likely be
awarded extramural funding by the end of Phase I. The Core also provided Grant Resubmission Awards (GRAs)
to researchers with high-scoring, but unfunded, NIH proposals, and nearly all GRAs (5/6) secured subsequent
funding. To allow investigators and their teams to build skills, the Core sponsored multi-day grant writing
workshops, including one focusing specifically on Career Development Awards, and multiple other CTR-focused
trainings. To increase the availability of high-quality mentoring, the Core sponsored senior faculty to become
facilitators of interactive curriculum from the National Research Mentoring Network and the Center of Improved
Mentoring Experiences. Subsequently 105 junior and senior faculty have completed this outstanding training.
Finally, in response to awardee feedback, the Core developed and implemented a year-long, intensive training
program for junior faculty writing K awards, the Advanced-K Program. We see enormous opportunity as
Advance-CTR undertakes Phase II, with an enhanced emphasis on faculty from underrepresented populations
and on community engagement. For Phase II, the PD Core proposes the following Specific Aims: (1) Provide
funding mechanisms and enhance essential clinical and translational competencies to promote equity and
competitiveness of the RI investigator community, (2) Position junior investigators to secure grant funding and
achieve independence, and (3) Expand the dissemination of best practices in mentoring. Expected results of this
evolution include greater emphasis on community engaged research; continued preparation of junior
investigators through MRAs to attract NIH funding; expanded dissemination of training and skills to conduct CTR,
including training in entrepreneurship and community engagement; more faculty with K- and R-series awards;
and a larger, more connected state-wide mentoring network. Expected benefits to RI include enhanced attention
to health priorities and disparities, a more stable CTR workforce, an enhanced sense of community for CTR
investigators, more research funding, and improved ability to attract and retain CTR researchers. In the longer
term, we anticipate the PD Core will contribute to improving the health and wellbeing of the state’s population."
10929389,"ABSTRACT – BIOSTATISTICS, EPIDEMIOLOGY, AND RESEARCH DESIGN CORE
The BERD Core has helped to transform clinical and translational research in Rhode Island during Phase I of
Advance-CTR providing guidance in study design, data collection, data analysis, framing of results and drawing
reasoned inferences. BERD has also provided training in research principles and a variety of essential tools.
The result has been a markedly improved quality of research applications, increased diffusion of research
support to young investigators, a high level of satisfaction and excitement in the research community, and a
desire for even more support.
In Phase II, the BERD Core will expand its support into new areas, using new modalities and reaching out to
new audiences. We will work to connect the many isolated groups of analysts with whom we have connected
who are embedded within Advance-CTR partners. Our goal is to evolve toward a sustainable infrastructure that
meets the research needs of the entire state. By capitalizing on the existing resources of partner institutions, our
efforts will help maximize the value of their existing investments as well as point to gaps in needs that can be
filled through collaboration or expansion. Our centralized web portal already efficiently matches investigators to
a highly qualified and diverse set of experts with long-term consultative experience and a reservoir of faculty
research leaders skilled at teaching. We will expand consultative and training support, including adding a second
Core Co-Lead, for designing and analyzing qualitative and mixed methods data. To increase enrollment and
boost retention for training, flipped and asynchronous online modalities will be emphasized. The Advance-CTR
website will be expanded to host educational pages. In addition to continuing support for the Pilot Project
Program, Professional Development and Biomedical Informatics, Bioinformatics, and Cyberinfrastructure
Enhancement (BIBCE) Core, we will collaborate with the new Community Engagement and Outreach Core to
develop strategies to increase community participation in study design and data collection, design studies that
properly address the health needs of the community and create results presentations that inform community
decision making. To accomplish these goals, we propose the following Specific Aims.
Specific Aim 1: Provide easily accessible, multidisciplinary collaborative support for quantitative and qualitative
research design, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination that can work seamlessly with and within existing
health research structures.
Specific Aim 2: Provide training in study design, epidemiology, biostatistics and qualitative and mixed methods
to clinical and translational researchers and research staff, delivered in a variety of formats, both synchronous
and asynchronous (in-person and remote), using the latest educational methods and technologies.
Specific Aim 3: Facilitate the development and widespread dissemination of innovative design and analytic
methods and tools for clinical and translational research."
10929393,"ABSTRACT – COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND OUTREACH CORE
There is tremendous need to coordinate disparate activities with a focus on better aligning research with the
health needs and public policy priorities identified by the Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH), the
broader Rhode Island (RI) community and the Latinx community in particular. Too often, interventions tested in
traditional research studies and found to be effective do not translate into positive outcomes in practice or
cannot be practically applied in clinical and community settings. Addressing the challenges of translating
research findings into clinical practice must require the engagement of key stakeholders, community members,
health care teams, program managers, and policy-makers, who are integral to the success, sustainability, and
scalability of these efforts3. The goal of the Community Engagement and Outreach core (CEO) is to help ensure
that the research undertaken by the Advance-CTR team is relevant, accessible and impactful for the entire
state of Rhode Island. We further believe that we should support research projects that strive to reduce health
disparities in our small, but very ethnically and racially diverse state. Perhaps most importantly, we believe this
approach will help ensure that the translational research enterprise ultimately benefits communities that bear a
disproportionate share of the disease burden in Rhode Island, particularly Latinx communities in our urban
core surrounding Providence. RI is a small but racially and ethnically diverse state. Approximately 5% of Rhode
Islanders are Black/African American. RI is also home to sizable immigrant populations from Southeast Asia,
India, China and Lusophone Africa. Notably, Rhode Island is home to a large Latinx population; 18% of the
state is of Latinx and 44% of Providence, RI’s largest city, is Latinx. Addressing the health of our diverse state
requires culturally tailored approaches to integrate their participation into the translational research process,
and ultimately, to oversee research that responds to the health needs of these populations. Our approach will
contribute to research focused on helping reduce health disparities through elevating the health needs and
participation of communities and patients in all research activities, integrating community engagement
and a culture of reciprocity into all aspects of Advance-CTR, and creating a Community Engaged
Practice-based Research Network (CEPBRN). Our activities will be grounded in the philosophy and culture
of partnership and reciprocity. This is not a “research method” but a values system that informs and infuses all
elements of our research activities and our team culture. Community stakeholders participate in dissemination
of study results, including publication and dissemination of study findings to the general public and the
communities who stand to benefit from knowledge production. This culture and our commitment to community
participation at every stage of the research process will help ensure that our activities are relevant to populations
who experience health disparities and to the Rhode Island community at large.

10929400,"ABSTRACT – PILOT PROJECTS PROGRAM
While Advance CTR has served as a catalyst to transform the quality and quantity of clinical and translational
research (CTR) in Rhode Island, there remains a need to sustain these gains and evolve to address the
state’s health priorities with engagement of the community. Furthermore, we have identified new unmet
needs of investigators to foster interdisciplinary networks, to enhance community-based research efforts,
and to support awards for key preliminary data. This includes jump-start grants for junior investigators
applying for K awards. Therefore, in this renewal application, our goal is to expand the Pilot Project Program
and build on the transformative progress while evolving to meet the new needs of the investigator
community. The Specific Aims of the Pilot Projects Program (PPP) are to (1) award high-impact pilot
projects that propose to develop translational approaches for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment
of diseases and to improve health in RI; (2) facilitate clinical and translational research through
prioritization of interdisciplinary, inter-institutional, and community-based collaborations; (3)
promote professional development and extramural funding of junior faculty pilot project awardees
through synergy with Advance-CTR Core activities; and (4) strengthen collaboration and
communication among Rhode Island investigators through the Emerging Areas of Research
Symposium. In the PPP, we will continue to solicit, review, award, oversee, and evaluate one-year clinical
and translational science pilot projects from junior investigators and more senior investigators transitioning
to a CTR focus. Additional Micro-Grants will be made available to support generation of key preliminary
data. We will also promote interdisciplinary and inter-institutional networks of investigators by funding of
research retreats and small pilot grants to jump-start resulting new collaborations. We will prioritize clinical
and community engaged research and projects that address diseases that affect the medically underserved
and/or diseases that disproportionately affect RI population. The PPP will continue to leverage professional
development opportunities, functions, and facilities offered by other cores and services of Advance CTR. In
order to stimulate CTR and collaboration in high impact areas, the PPP will continue to host an annual
research symposium on relevant topics. The PPP will be led by Sharon Rounds (Core Lead) with co-Lead
Gaurav Choudhary. It will be supported by the PPP Steering/Review Committee that includes
representatives from all partner institutions plus community representatives. The PPP will continue to be an
integral part of the Advance CTR, catalyzing collaborative and community-based Clinical and Translational
Research to promote health.

10929406,"ABSTRACT – TRACKING AND EVALUATION CORE
The advancement of clinical and translational science in Rhode Island requires careful planning and
implementation, stakeholder engagement, efficient use of resources, and an integrated approach by the key
components. Advance-CTR will continue to benefit from high caliber program evaluation by the Tracking and
Evaluation (T&E) Core to achieve its goals and demonstrate its effectiveness. The T&E Core utilizes a
participatory stakeholder-driven approach to evaluation that adapts its designs as the Advance-CTR program
evolves. A logic model for evaluation defines program activities, outputs, and intermediate and distal impacts.
This model guides the T&E Core in working with Core Directors and the Operations Committee to revise and
augment the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) compiled in the T&E Core’s biannual reports. Additionally,
the T&E Core informs the Operations and Steering Committees by performing satisfaction and needs
assessment surveys. The T&E Core has pioneered the use of participatory Group Concept Mapping (GCM)
for needs assessment within CTR programs. It has been applied by the T&E Core to examine research
barriers confronting investigators, and to elucidate the divergent health priorities of community stakeholders.
A subsequent application of the GCM approach will address strategies for enhancing community participation
in the design and implementation of research protocols. The T&E Core is supported by a comprehensive
information management system that efficiently captures the necessary data elements to tabulate KPIs
reported to Core Directors and Advisory Committees. Paramount domains of measurement will continue to
include the efficiency in Core use of resources, trends in service utilization, satisfaction with services provided,
levels and quality of applications to award programs, and research outputs, including grants awarded,
publications and presentations. The T&E Core will increasingly evaluate impacts at the institutional and
community levels. Needs assessment activities will include evaluating barriers and facilitators within research
centers, institutes, and other focused research groups existing among our partner organizations. Another
important role of the T&E Core is to support Advance-CTR in responding to the diverse range of health
priorities identified by community groups and state agencies. The T&E Core works closely with Advance-
CTR’s Community Engagement and Outreach Core to evaluate how community needs and concerns are
incorporated into research designs. Additionally, the T&E Core conducts interviews and convenes focus
groups to better understand the translational impacts of awardees’ research. Lastly, continuity is essential to
maintaining momentum in program evaluation. The T&E Core benefits from the stability of its team, and their
strong relationships with peer evaluation scientists from other CTR and CTSA programs."
10929414,"ABSTRACT – BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS, BIOINFORMATICS, AND CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE
ENHANCEMENT CORE
The successful execution of clinical and translational research relies on coordinated access, curation,
management, preservation, analysis, and dissemination of data, information, and knowledge from many sources
(e.g., academic, health, and government). The long-term goal of the Advance-CTR Biomedical Informatics,
Bioinformatics, and Cyberinfrastructure Enhancement (BIBCE) Core is to transform the environment for clinical
and translational research in Rhode Island by enabling access to electronic health data, providing core
informatics infrastructure, and identifying dissemination, implementation, and improvement strategies to
overcome barriers to adoption of evidence into practice. Core activities are coordinated by the Brown Center for
Biomedical Informatics, along with leadership from Advance-CTR partners (Brown University, The University of
Rhode Island, Lifespan, Care New England, VA Providence Healthcare System, the Rhode Island Department
of Health, and the Rhode Island Quality Institute). Through formal arrangements with our data partners, we have
overcome barriers to accessing and sharing statewide data. The focus of the next phase of the BIBCE Core will
be on establishing scalable resources and services for standardized and integrated access. Regular engagement
of key stakeholders from the academic, health, and government communities has been critical as BIBCE Core
resources and services are further enhanced to promote sustainability. The Core also seeks to train and engage
researchers in best practices for applying resources, knowledge, and skills to support data- and technology-
driven projects across the spectrum of basic, clinical, and population science. The mission of the BIBCE Core is
thus to advance use of data and technology to support the full spectrum of clinical and translational research.
The Specific Aims are to: (1) Promote a sustainable and extensible informatics infrastructure to support the
diversity of clinical and translational research needs; (2) Develop innovative data, software, and technology
solutions in collaboration with clinical and translational researchers; and, (3) Provide state-of-the-art informatics
training and engagement with clinical and translational research stakeholders. The BIBCE Core capitalizes on
the diverse population of Rhode Island to disseminate, implement, and improve solutions that are relevant to our
local community, and still be scaled nationally. Metrics for success to transform and invigorate clinical and
translational research are aligned with national standards for evaluation as defined by the biomedical informatics
community. Guided by the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance)
framework and in collaboration with the Tracking and Evaluation Core, we will evaluate these outcomes, impacts,
and metrics to gauge progress and success in meeting overall Advance-CTR objectives, including for our state’s
health priorities. The continued engagement of Advance-CTR partners with the shared vision of using data and
technology to improve the health of the State’s and regional population will synergistically expand clinical and
translational research opportunities."
10912516,"Core 1 Abstract
Given the poor prognosis for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who develop Richter
syndrome (RS), an expanded molecular understanding of RS is critical both to understand which
patients are at greatest risk and to develop improved therapeutic strategies. There is currently no
effective standard of care therapy for RS patients, and this is likely to be a growing problem, as
increasing numbers of CLL patients treated with novel agents are living longer, putting them at risk of
developing RS. The fundamental mission of Core 1 is to ensure a robust tissue resource of clinically-
annotated primary samples from patients with RS treated both on and off clinical trials. Additionally, we
will maximize opportunities to procure matched CLL samples—highly feasible because of our long-
established deep CLL sample repository-- so that clonal relationships between RS and antecedent CLL,
and molecular and functional differences between these two related entities, can be studied. We will
also continue our systematic banking of cell and plasma samples from all CLL patients seen at our
center. We will emphasize banking those at high risk for developing RS, both prior to any evidence of
transformation and at the time their CLL has progressed to RS, for evaluation of cell-free DNA as a
method of early detection. In this fashion, the resources of this Core will supply the Projects with the
necessary primary RS and CLL tissue to understand the genesis, biology, and most promising
therapeutic targets in RS. We have established the infrastructure and a coordinated workflow to obtain
fresh RS biopsies both from patients enrolled on treatment trials and those treated outside the trial
setting. We have well-established systems to efficiently distribute cellular and nucleic acid material
across the Program, for deep molecular profiling as described in the Projects. We have further
coordinated with external clinical trial sites to share processing SOPs so that biopsy material can be
obtained and processed in a uniform fashion across studies and institutions. We already have sufficient
RS patient samples in our BioBanks to allow us to immediately begin to generate data through the
Projects. Through the efforts detailed in this Core section, we plan to significantly increase the
availability of such samples to fuel the science of the Projects throughout the timeline of this award and
beyond. These efforts will provide a firm foundation for future translation of the research findings into
potential novel biomarkers of RS development, as well as the biology of RS itself and its potential
therapeutic vulnerabilities, thereby facilitating the development of novel clinical trials."

To maximize the cohesiveness and impacts of the Georgia Center for Diabetes Translation Research
(GCDTR), Core A (the Administrative Core) provides the leadership, infrastructure, oversight, administrative
support, and promotion and dissemination functions. GCDTR has retained and expanded a diverse team of
leaders (including specific senior leadership for equity) to serve on the Executive Council and involved them in
developing the center’s vision, mission, conceptual framework, and administrative processes over the past 4
years (GY 1-4). The GCDTR Director and Executive Council have raised considerable personal and matched
financial support for the GCDTR which will be used to nearly quadruple annual Pilot and Feasibility (P&F) grant
awards. Core A has an illustrious group of Internal and External Advisory Committee members to continue to
provide advice and direction on center management, strategy, growth, and impact regionally and nationally. In
this renewal, we have formed an Junior Faculty Advisory Committee to gather actionable feedback from a key
GCDTR user group, establish processes for peer mentoring to support them, and link and sponsor aspiring
diabetes translation investigators to opportunities and networks. Core A has developed transparent
administrative policies and processes, including regular evaluation, reporting, and revision of annual strategic
goals, ensuring that oversight and strategic growth of the Center are parallel and complementary goals.
Administrative processes are not intended to be onerous, but rather, to stimulate efficiency and cohesiveness
across the center, and to intentionally promote the overarching vision of equity. Specific Core A activities will
include: annual strategic planning; administration of funds to Cores and Programs (funds derived from the
grant, matched funds sponsored by partner institutions, and funds derived from service pay-back
mechanisms); serving as the forum for regular Executive Council progress updates and strategy discussion;
monitoring equity metrics for GCDTR membership, Enrichment, and Pilot and Feasibility (P&F) activities;
internal and external annual progress reviews and reporting (for the Internal and External Advisory Committees
and the NIH); promoting recruitment, enrichment, retention, and collaboration across campuses (working
closely with key institutional partners, University Department Chairs and Deans, through the P&F and
Enrichment Programs, and through the dedicated Junior Faculty Advisory Committee, with a Representative
role on GCDTR’s Executive Council); and supporting the Regional Core in relationship management and
dissemination of scientific data to GCDTR Faculty, regional affiliate institutions and members, and the broader
community. Through its mix of experienced processes and personnel, the Administrative Core is poised to
further increase GCDTR’s visibility, reputation, growth, and impacts on diabetes translation research and
diabetes outcomes in the Southeast."
10917197,"CORE B: PROGRAM SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
While there has been much progress in building the evidence to prevent diabetes and its complications, and
notable improvements in quality of care and incidence of vascular complications among people with diagnosed
diabetes over the past 30 years, there is a large unfinished agenda. Identification of people at risk for and with
diabetes, and uptake of prevention programs are suboptimal; and more can be done to achieve recommended
care goals and reduce morbidity, especially among minorities and vulnerable subpopulations. Translation
research, especially health and preventive services research, design, and evaluation can help close gaps
equitably by helping identify how to tailor implementation efforts to better suit target populations and by
generating policy-, program-, and practice-oriented data to inform investments in diabetes. Though there is
plentiful demand in the Southeastern U.S., availability of relevant expertise is limited and fragmented, which is
a barrier for aspiring junior and underrepresented minority (URM) investigators. Core B (Design and
Evaluation for Equity) of the Georgia Center for Diabetes Translation Research (GCDTR) is poised to fill this
void by facilitating access to local, regional, and national datasets (Aim 1); offering accessible, cohesive, and
multi-disciplinary methodological, analytical, and strategic expertise in diabetes translation research (Aim 2);
and helping link research with opportunities for translation and implementation (Aim 3). Core B's collective
expertise, networks and partnerships, and access to key databases that are in high demand make it well-suited
for stimulating high-quality diabetes translation research and uptake among a wide array of stakeholders
(academics, health care, non- and for-profit organizations, and local and federal government). In its first 4
years, Core B has developed a strong culture of multi-disciplinarity, collegiality, continuous learning, and
leverage. Building on these successes, Core B will continue its focus on prioritizing support for junior and URM
investigators. The Core is well-integrated with other GCDTR Cores and Programs and embodies the same
ethos of promoting equity at our institutions, our membership, and in our research. Core Experts will continue
to engage in the GCDTR's catalyst and dissemination activities (Pilot and Feasibility and Enrichment
Programs) and complement the other Cores. Core B Experts will be accessible and active with simple
operating and reporting structures that facilitate more effective and cost-effective science. Core B has
expertise in health services and disparities research, clinical medicine (primary care, geriatrics, endocrinology,
preventive cardiology), nursing, systems design, statistics, analytics, epidemiology, engineering, management,
and economics. Continuing to leverage Core B's collective expertise and resources offers an expedient and
efficient opportunity to advance the field, promoting equity for the increasingly diverse population in the
Southeastern U.S., and informing local initiatives to improve metabolic health in the region."
10907633,"ABSTRACT.
Prostate cancer (CaP) is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancer
amongst Veterans. Approximately 7% of US CaP cases are diagnosed and treated in the Veteran population.
High risk (HR), localized CaP represents 20-25% of the approximately 250,000 new cases of CaP expected in
the US in 2022. The outcomes of HR CaP are variable, with some patients remaining in remission and others
suffering from metastatic progression and death. Our ability to discriminate between patients who will fare well
following curative-intent treatment versus those destined for lethal metastatic progression remains poor. Our
overall objective is to apply artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to generate novel predictors of metastasis-free
survival (MFS), the only validated surrogate for overall survival in localized CaP, from a large repository of digital
pathology and radiographic images. We will then combine these AI-derived biomarkers with clinical-pathologic
and social determinants of health (SDoH) variables collected from Veterans with HR CaP to develop and test
multivariable prognostic models that improve our ability to predict MFS.
AI, including computer vision and machine learning approaches, allows extraction of image patterns for sub-
visual based characterization of CaP. Routine diagnostic prostate needle biopsy pathology slides that have been
digitized as well as digital radiographic images (e.g. MRI) can be leveraged for machine learning derived from
either (1) hand-crafted features (guided by existing domain knowledge) which are then used as the inputs to
develop the machine-learning model based on the selected features, or (2) the raw data itself, which are used
as inputs to develop the model through convolutional neural networks or other methods in an unsupervised
manner. The former leverages existing domain knowledge and may require less input data, whereas the latter
is not limited by prior knowledge, but requires more training data. We hypothesize that machine learning models
based on multimodal data derived from MRI and digital pathology can be combined with clinic-pathologic and
SDoH data to generate “super classifiers” that more accurately predict outcome without the need for costly tissue
destructive methods.
We propose to establish a collection of digital pathology and prostate MRI images along with clinic-pathologic
and SDoH data from >5,000 Veterans with HR CaP who have been treated with curative intent and a minimum
of 5 years of follow-up using our existing approved biorepository protocol. Subsequently, we will determine the
most robust AI algorithm for each data source, and then test combinations of algorithms to generate a
“superclassifier” that integrates AI-derived predictive models with standard clinico-pathologic and SDoH
variables to predict MFS. Improved prognostication could illuminate strategies for treatment intensification or de-
intensification that can be formally tested in future clinical trials. The substantial infrastructure and databases
generated by this proposal as part of our repository will be accessible by intramural VA and extramural
investigators for future approved studies."
10924001,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Vision. Participant engagement and sequencing research from the Washington University Participant
Engagement and Cancer Genomic Sequencing Center (WU-PE-CGS) will fill critical gaps in knowledge,
methodology, and characterization of understudied cancer populations, leading to optimal approaches to
participant engagement, outreach, and communication in genomic characterization studies.
Goal. The overall goal of the WU-PE-CGS is to build a rigorous, scientific evidence base for approaches direct
engagement of cancer patients and post-treatment cancer survivors as participants in cancer research. Our
focus is on rare and understudied cancer populations with significant disparities including cholangiocarcinoma,
multiple myeloma, and colorectal cancer under age 50. Participant engagement strategies are most effective
when they are adapted and implemented in real-world settings in partnership with community and patient
advocacy stakeholders.
Setting. Our Center will be housed in an exceptional environment that fosters transdisciplinary collaboration,
catalyzes new ideas in patient engagement, and ensures support for patient engagement and genome
sequencing that finds solutions for complex recruitment and engagement challenges in real-world settings with
underrepresented patient populations. Significant matching contributions from Washington University will allow
us to quickly and strategically invest in ideas.
Aims. The specific aims of the Center are to: (1) Advance the field of participant engagement to study cancer
disparities and rare cancers by conducting innovative and impactful direct stakeholder engagement with
continuous evaluation and research; (2) Expand an exceptional, diverse team of investigators, patients, and
advocacy stakeholders; (3) Address cancer disparities by understanding barriers to and improving the ability
for disadvantaged and understudied populations to encounter, use, and benefit from genomic sequencing and
analysis; (4) Organize and integrate Center units to facilitate transdisciplinary, team science within our Center
and across the PE-CGS Network.
Innovations and impact. The WU-PE-CGS builds on a long and outstanding record of leadership in both cancer
disparities and genomic research across the cancer continuum. We will be particularly innovative and allow for
a significant return on the scientific investment in several ways. First, our Center has distinctive features that
include a combined focus on cancer disparities, the application of strategies to increase participant
engagement in research, success in biospecimen acquisition, and exceptional genomic sequencing expertise.
Second, we have assembled a diverse, world class team with strong linkages to multiple rare and understudied
cancers. Third, we engage investigators from different disciplines and invest in the development of early
career scholars. Fourth, we will strategically and creatively disseminate products in ways that will benefit
researchers, practitioners, and community members. Fifth, we will partner with exceptional patient-centered
and wide-reaching advocacy groups to engage patients, optimize recruitment, and seamlessly return results.
Input from these groups, patients, and their families is a key strength that will leverage our track record of
stakeholder-engaged research. And finally, we have developed a focused strategy for collective integration of
our units. These synergies will allow our Center to become a national resource for optimal approaches to
participant engagement, outreach, and communication in genomic characterization studies and other studies
as technologies advance that will accelerate progress for both the scientific community, patients and their
communities.
 In summary, we are uniquely situated to advance a network of participant engagement and sequencing
researchers, integrate research with patients and their stakeholders, build intellectual capital, and significantly
enhance the capacity for participant engagement and genomic characterization studies. This Center will
ultimately benefit health systems, providers, and people with rare cancers and lead to a reduction in cancer
disparities."
10909264,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Liver cirrhosis poses a significant public health burden in the United States (US) as it is associated with
substantial morbidity, mortality and cost. An estimated one-third of patients develop decompensating events
such as gastrointestinal variceal bleeding, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy (HE), jaundice, and renal impairment.
Further, these poor outcomes are also associated with development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the
cirrhotic liver, the ninth leading cause of death among cancers within the US. While transplantation is a curative
treatment for cirrhosis, patients are often ineligible for transplantation due to lack of available organs and
additional risks involved. Thus, patients and providers frequently focus on symptomatic treatment options such
as lifestyle/nutrition modifications to initiate weight loss and optimize protein absorption, nonselective beta-
blockers to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, and treatment for HE to improve confusion. A recent
meta-analysis suggests statin therapy as a promising treatment for cirrhosis as statins tend to decrease oxidative
stress and inflammation and increase endothelial cell function, with downstream effects including reduction of
hepatic inflammation, fibrosis, and vascular tone. Although this review represents over 120 thousand patients,
true efficacy data in the setting of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) are presently limited to just four RCTs from
outside of the US, representing less than 300 patients with cirrhosis.
To better understand the natural history of the disease and also to further evaluate the use of statins in the
treatment of cirrhosis, the Liver Cirrhosis Network (LCN), consisting of up to 10 clinical centers (CCs) and one
Scientific and Data Coordination Center (SDCC) will be charged with developing (a) a prospective cohort and
(b) an RCT to evaluate statin efficacy in patients with cirrhosis. Northwestern University Data Analysis and
Coordinating Center (NUDACC) and its partners propose to serve as the SDCC--the central scientific and
leadership core for the LCN--coordinating all operational and data-related activities using cutting-edge resources
for study design, planning and conduct, ongoing monitoring, and statistical analyses. NUDACC unites an
interdisciplinary team with wide-ranging experience including collaborative and methodologic biostatisticians,
hepatologists, data managers, project managers, and multiple supporting study staff. Together we propose to
collaborate with the LCN to lead the design, conduct, coordination, oversight, management, administration,
analyses, and dissemination for the LCN-related studies."
10917168,"Project Summary/Abstract
The last few decades have seen major inroads into detailing the physiological mechanisms supporting vision
as well as therapies aimed at rescue and repair of neurons affected by retinal diseases. For the continued
evolution of treatments and their rapid translation to the clinic, it is essential to find a non-invasive, all-optical
biomarker to monitor the efficacy of disease and potential therapeutic agents. To this end, we propose to
develop the optoretinogram, or ORG, the optical analog to the electroretinogram (ERG) which is the current
gold standard for retinal function assessment in humans. The ORG is rooted in classical interferometry and
enables a highly sensitive assay of how neurons interact with light. Using this technique, our group has
demonstrated the ability to visualize light-driven neural activity across a range of spatiotemporal resolution –
from single cells to a collection of neurons, and from µsecs to ms timescales. Here, we aim to expand the
capabilities of the ORG and demonstrate its efficacy for basic science and clinical applications. The proposed
technology is built upon a solid foundation of established approaches, and combines them in new and
complementary ways to achieve an optimal combination of speed, resolution and sensitivity geared towards
overcoming the key challenges faced with imaging cellular structure-function in humans. The core technologies
are phase-resolved OCT, an eye-safe, interferometric method to measure nm-scale changes at ms time
scales in vivo, adaptive optics (AO) to overcome ocular aberrations, increase the signal-to-noise and allow
resolution down to single cells and real-time eye tracking to overcome eye motion and allow targeting,
recording and averaging of responses from single and a collection of retinal neurons. These are implemented
across three ORG platforms. At the University of Washington, we will refine the line-scan phase-resolved OCT
with improvements in optical design and eye-tracking and use it to characterize the basic properties of
phototransduction and inner retinal function in healthy human volunteers and patients with retinal
degenerations. At Stanford University, we will develop a similar line-scan system for rodents, and together with
transgenic models and pharmacology, determine the biophysical mechanisms that underlie the ORG and
develop templates for human recordings. At UC Berkeley, we will push the envelope of speed and sensitivity
by incorporating a real-time eye-tracking system to drive an AO-OCT interferometric probe, with the aim to
measure the tiniest and briefest neuronal changes in the human retina. This bioengineering research
partnership will benefit from complementary expertise, research direction and ORG implementation across the
three sites, and the use of common approaches for image/data analysis, eye tracking and visual stimulation.
Ultimately, the aggregate technology will facilitate a deeper mechanistic understanding of early visual
processing and eye disease, and provide entirely new avenues for accelerating therapeutic interventions."
10915543,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable blood cancer affecting approximately 83,000 people in the United States.
Although treatments for MM have improved significantly in recent years, the vast majority of patients experience
multiple relapses and ultimately succumb to complications of the disease. For the last 12 years, I, the Research
Specialist, have devoted my work toward contributing to improving outcomes for cancer patients. Since 2014, I
have worked in the laboratory of Unit Director Flavia Pichiorri, where we exclusively specialize in MM. I am now
involved with three National Cancer Institute–funded studies. 1) Radioimmunotherapy/CAR T cells: The use
of therapeutic isotopes such as the beta emitter 177Lu or the alpha emitter 225Ac have increased the specific killing
of cancer cells, but side effects are clinical concerns. Although CAR T cells may reduce tumor burden, patients
remain at risk of relapse. We predict that the use of CD38-directed radioimmunotherapy and CS1-directed CAR
T cells will result in more durable remissions while lowering the dose for each agent, with decreased side effects
and enhanced immunomodulation. 2) Reolysin: Reolysin, an oncovirus, shows only modest activity in MM
patients, likely because of resistance mechanisms to oncoviruses. We observed that carflizomib, a second
generation proteasome inhibitor, showed synergic killing of MM cells in vitro when combined with Reolysin. We
found that carfilzomib facilitates Reolysin infection through modulation of the antiviral response of the
microenvironment. We also discovered that HDAC inhibitors can reduce the surface expression of an important
adhesion receptor and upregulate the expression of an oncovirus receptor. 3) Overcoming IMiD research in
myeloma: To overcome disease resistance to immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) such as lenalidomide (Len),
combinatorial therapies may be necessary. I have investigated the safe, orally available drug leflunomide (Lef),
which has been used for rheumatoid arthritis for the last 20 years. We demonstrated that Lef directly inhibits
several kinases, including the PIM family of serine/threonine kinases in MM cells, negatively affecting c-Myc
protein levels, which are commonly upregulated in MM. With this information, we reasoned that a suitable drug
to use in combination is the immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide (Len). The completion of the projects’ goals
will rely in large part on my qualifications, and the results thus far point to my value as a Research Specialist in
the cancer research community."
10909052,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) have poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Immune
checkpoint therapies, which have shown dramatic benefits in other cancers, have failed to improve outcomes in
GBM patients in all randomized phase III trials. Brain tumors generate mechanical forces as they grow in the
confined space of the cranium, and we have shown that these physical forces affect cell viability and phenotype
(Nature Biotechnology 1997, PNAS 2012, Nature Biomedical Engineering 2016, 2019, Science 2020). Our
preliminary results indicate that compressive forces similar to those in brain tumors are sufficient to upregulate
stress granule protein G3BP2 as well as genes associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),
stemness and the immune checkpoints. Furthermore, we have shown G3BP2 regulates cancer cell stemness
in breast cancer (PNAS 2017). Thus, we hypothesize that mechanical stresses in the GBM environment
contribute to GBM stemness and immunosuppression, and that the pathways involved can be targeted to
enhance tumor killing. In this project, we will dissect the stress-induced pathways involved in mechanical
regulation of stemness and immunosuppression in GBM. We will then block these pathways in orthotopic,
immunocompetent mouse models of GBM to enhance immunotherapy. The overall goal of the study is to identify
new strategies and targets for amplifying anti-tumor immunity based on mechanobiological control mechanisms."
10842294,"The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted elderly vulnerable populations (i.e., racial/ethnic
minorities and rural residents). The high risk for acquiring COVID-19 and the dire outcomes in these vulnerable
populations is partially explained by the high prevalence of comorbidities and other social determinants of
health. Home healthcare agencies (HHAs) and nursing homes (NHs), provide essential post-acute services for
a large number of elderly patients. The pandemic has disrupted care transitions from hospitals to HHAs and
NHs, which may lead to important health outcomes consequences, including the widening of existing health
disparities. In our previous, pre-COVID-19 studies, we have found that when HHAs and NHs provide best
practices in infection prevention and control (IPC) nosocomial infections are reduced. Building upon this novel
previous work and guided by the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD)
framework, the aims of this study are to: 1) Describe how HHA and NH IPC programs have changed in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic across the nation, and examine if these changes vary for facilities serving
a large proportion of vulnerable populations; 2) Characterize how COVID-19 disrupted hospital admissions and
subsequent discharges to HHAs and NHs, and determine if the disruptions disproportionately affected
vulnerable populations; and, 3) Quantify the impact of COVID-19 on inpatient, HHA and NH health outcomes
and the effectiveness of IPC programs in HHAs and NHs in reducing the impact of the pandemic in vulnerable
and non-vulnerable elderly populations. In Aim 1, we will conduct qualitative interviews of and a national survey
of HHAs and NHs. We will sample from the core HHAs and NHs from our pre-COVID-19 surveys and augment
with new facilities as needed. We will link our prior surveys and the new 2022 survey to examine changes in
IPC programs and determine if these changes differed in facilities predominately serving vulnerable
populations. In Aim 2, we will use longitudinal (2013 to 2022) Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) data
to characterize how select urgent and elective hospital admissions and discharge dispositions to HHAs and
NHs changed with COVID-19; and, whether these changes differed for vulnerable populations. In Aim 3, we
will link our pre-COVID surveys and the 2022 survey with longitudinal CMS data to model the health outcomes
(i.e., COVID-19 cases, infections, rehospitalizations and mortality) of elderly Medicare beneficiaries, controlling
for the local COVID-19 environment. Our prior national surveys of IPC in both NHs and HHAs are ideal and
novel baseline data. Leveraging our prior work, this innovative study will address the impact of COVID-19 on
transitions and health outcomes of elderly, vulnerable patients (i.e., racial and ethnic minorities versus non-
Latinx whites and urban versus rural), identify health disparities and effective practices to mitigate health
disparities. The study findings will also inform NHs, HHAs and policymakers in future planning for infectious
disease emergencies and decrease health disparities."

 The goal of this project is to significantly advance the field of acute and semichronic epilepsy monitoring
using novel, high-resolution electrocorticography (ECoG) record/stimulate grids (4096/256 channels,
respectively) and stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) depth electrodes (120/8 micro/macro) with full wireless
data and power transfer. This project builds on our previous success in conducting the first-ever human trials for
acute mapping of eloquent brain tissue with multi-thousand channel microelectrode grids. The proposed system
encompasses multiple transformative technological approaches, including: (1) leveraging advanced thin-film
microfabrication on 8” diameter substrates, thus permitting long integrated connectorization from thousands of
channels; (2) exploiting a newly developed platinum nanorod (PtNR) microelectrode technology with excellent
low impedance, high charge-injection-capacity (4.4mC/cm2), stability, and biocompatibility; and (3) using a thin
(~10μm) parylene C substrate that is compliant to brain movements, conformal to brain curvature, and
transparent, permitting easier visualization of brain anatomy during the acute mapping. Further, (4) the grids
developed for this project are modular and can be trimmed to fit different sizes of craniotomies, and (5) this
system offers a new generation of minimally invasive sEEG electrodes with easily reconfigurable microcontact
distribution in different regions of the brain Our proposed system also (6) employs state-of-the-art acquisition
electronics with a miniaturized 1024ch neural interface system-on-chip and radio transmission of data and power,
enabling fully wireless monitoring that eliminates wire externalization, and (7) deploys multi-screen and multi-
window visualization of the whole repertoire of electrophysiological activity, with the option to display and interpret
signals in standard fashion.
 Our goal is to demonstrate in the semichronic clinical setting a high-definition display of traditional and
emerging clinical biomarkers for epilepsy monitoring and treatment. To achieve this goal, we will pursue in Aim
1 regulatory input from the FDA and scale our grids under good quality laboratory practices (GLP), and perform
benchtop testing and hardware and software development under a quality management system. In Aim 2, we
will perform semichronic animal testing under GLP to demonstrate safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the new
epilepsy-monitoring system. In Aim 3, we will will perform pre-clinical and human intraoperative recordings with
appropriate IRB authorization. We will pursue FDA clearance for semichronic implants in Aim 4, and transition
Aim 5 to semichronic epilepsy monitoring in patients with intractable epilepsy.
 The methods employed in device and system development, surgical approaches, electrophysiology, and data
analysis will not only advance functional and epilepsy monitoring but will also have significant implications for
numerous applications in neuromodulation/therapeutic stimulation, minimally destructive brain-machine
interfaces, and spinal cord stimulation."
10886713,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT. Gold-derived anticancer compounds are promising therapeutic agents for
disease applications, including cancer. Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive clinical subtype
of breast cancer that lacks effective therapy. Approximately, 66% of all breast cancer deaths are TNBC-related,
hence pragmatic treatment options are sorely needed. Our research program seeks to harness the unique spatial
properties and chemical reactivity of gold-based [Au(I) and Au(III)] complexes as a basis for new targeted
therapeutic regimen to eliminate TNBC. We have developed gold compound libraries with different scaffolds and
distinct mode of action in TNBC cells including modulating mitochondrial biogenesis and morphology. The
compounds display high potency in the nanomolar range with >30-fold selectivity to cancer cells over normal
cells. Comparative profiling using the NCI-60 screen confirmed toxicity of a lead compound, AuPhos against a
panel of breast cancer including TNBC. Preliminary maximum tolerated dose studies in BALB/c mice suggest
that different classes of gold compounds can be well tolerated in animals. Additionally, AuPhos exerts profound
antitumor effect and prevents liver metastasis in the metastatic 4T1 TNBC mouse model. Mechanism of action
studies suggest that the gold compounds target different mitochondrial processes including mitochondrial
biogenesis or morphology. We hypothesize that synthetic modification of the gold scaffold will enable the
development of a suite of gold-based drugs that are targeted to different mitochondrial locales and biological
targets to eliminate TNBC. We will test the hypothesis in this project via the following aims: Aim 1) optimize
chemically and functionally diverse gold anticancer agents; Aim 2) Delineate the mechanism of gold-based
modulation of mitochondrial function; and Aim 3) Determine the therapeutic index of optimized gold compounds
in TNBC mouse models. The outcomes of this project will 1) provide novel gold-based compounds with specificity
for mitochondrial function to eliminate TNBC; 2) delineate the mechanism of TNBC inhibition by the developed
gold-based compounds; and 3) establish in vivo efficacy and pharmacodynamics of gold anticancer agents.
Critically, the compounds generated will provide impetus for targeted therapies for TNBC, which is an unmet
need."
10907535,"Respiratory viral infections (RVI) have changed the world. RVI are a leading cause of infectious morbidity and
mortality in children undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and solid organ transplantation (SOT).
RVI diagnosis by qualitative PCR screening is sensitive, but unfortunately does not distinguish disease from
presence of viral nucleic acid or predict risk for progression from upper to the more severe lower respiratory tract
disease (LRTD). In the COVID-19 era, many centers now use pre-transplant RVI screening, but the implications
of detection in an asymptomatic host are unknown. Integrating quantitative viral load, viral sequencing, and/or
host immune (T cell and antibody) responses could provide novel predictive tools to stratify the risk of developing
an RVI and the progression to LRTD. Our objective is to establish a comprehensive RVI diagnostic and disease
progression predictive model in children undergoing transplantation. We propose a prospective multi-center
epidemiologic study of 2000 pediatric transplant recipients, with a nested case-control immunologic and virologic
substudy. This will be the largest study on RVI in any age group of HCT and SOT recipients. We will leverage
the Pediatric Transplant ID Network (PIDTRAN), a consortium of 21 nationwide sites and the only group
dedicated to pediatric transplant infectious diseases. We will obtain pre-transplant blood and nasal samples in
all 2000 transplant participants at enrollment and also blood at day +100 post-transplant. In Aim 1, we will
determine the prevalence of viral nucleic assay positivity using qualitative PCR and then perform quantitative
PCR (qPCR) and viral sequencing (metagenomics) on positive specimens. We hypothesize that the quantity of
respiratory viral nucleic acid or certain viral genotypes will identify patients at risk for RVI or disease progression.
In Aim 2, we will develop and validate an immunological classifier to predict risk of RVI and progression to LRTD
in a nested substudy focused on three major pediatric viruses: RSV, parainfluenza virus 3, and human
metapneumovirus. We will characterize pre-transplant humoral and cellular immune responses in the subset of
patients who develop those RVIs compared with pre-transplant immunologic and day +100 post-transplant
immune responses from uninfected matched controls. The combination of host response and virologic data
(qPCR and viral metagenomics) will also be compared between RVI cases who do or do not progress to LRTD
to identify biomarkers. We hypothesize that patients with specific qualitative or quantitative antibody responses
and/or specific T cell repertoires to RVI will have superior clinical outcomes. Characterizing a comprehensive
viral and host response pre-transplant, we will learn to predict who is at risk of RVI and LRTD and needs early
intervention vs. delay of transplant, and when PCR positivity is indicative of potential disease. These results will
allow us to generate novel evidence-based pediatric guidelines for personalized clinical management of children
undergoing transplant, and also inform future antiviral and vaccine studies in these high-risk patient populations."

10890016,"Project Summary
Internal sodium balance is critical for many physiological functions, including osmoregulation and action
potentials. Deciphering the mechanisms that control sodium intake is essential for understanding the
principles of appetite regulation and sodium homeostasis in the body. Our understanding of central
sodium appetite regulation is still lacking compared to other appetite circuits such as thirst and hunger. I
propose to study this fundamental brain circuit that controls our internal ion balance using transcriptomic
and molecular genetic tools. Our preliminary and published results have identified specific neural
populations in the mouse hindbrain and forebrain that acutely regulate sodium ingestion. However, it is
currently unknown how these distinct neural nodes contribute to sodium appetite. Our central hypothesis
is that distinct neural circuits regulate sodium appetite and tolerance. We will test this idea through three
specific aims. In Aim 1, we will use gain- and loss-of-function manipulations to examine if individual neural
populations control behavioral aversion and/or attraction toward sodium. This study is expected to identify
the functional roles of each genetically defined neural population in sodium ingestion. In Aim 2, we
propose to use genetics, virus tracing, and physiological recording to dissect the circuit organization
underlying sodium ingestion. Once the anatomical map is identified, we will use projection specific neural
perturbation to examine the function of the individual downstream regions. In Aim 3, we propose to
identify cell types from downstream areas of sodium appetite neurons. We will achieve this by combining
activity-dependent high-throughput single-cell transcriptomics and neural perturbation in the upstream
population. This approach is expected to dissect specific cell types that receive sodium appetite signals
from upstream neurons. We will then use genetic information of the identified downstream cell types to
examine how signals from distinct nuclei interact to drive sodium appetite. Together, this proposal will
provide critical insights into the brain-wide regulatory mechanisms underlying sodium ingestion."
10892249,"Access to readily available small diameter (2-4 mm) vascular grafts presents an unmet need to patients following
peripheral arterial injury or peripheral arterial atherosclerosis. Although prosthetic or autologous grafts could be
utilized for this purpose, the potential risk of infection or thrombus formation in prosthetic grafts and the limited
autologous vessel availability in a subset of patients arising from disease, prior utilization, or size mismatch to
the injured vessel restricts their application. Acellular tissue engineered vascular grafts (TEVGs) derived from
human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) provide a promising alternative to autologous or synthetic grafts.
These hiPSC-TEVGs can be constructed from vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and endothelial cells
(ECs) derived from hiPSCs and have previously been shown to have mechanical properties comparable to native
vessels used in clinical bypass surgeries. hiPSC-TEVGs offer several advantages over other vascular grafts,
notably the ability for hiPSCs to self-renew and differentiate into almost every cell type in the body allows for a
replenishable source from which to derive VSMCs to reproducibly create TEVGs. Critically, hiPSC-TEVGs could
be utilized to address the unmet needs of readily available small diameter vascular grafts for peripheral arterial
injury or atherosclerosis through decellularization followed by endothelialization of the TEVG. Whereas acellular
TEVGs could directly be implemented as larger diameter vascular grafts, small diameter grafts require an
endothelium to prevent thrombosis in the vessel. This fact further increases the value of the hiPSC technology
due to the successful derivation of hypoimmunogenic, “universal” ECs for this purpose. Hypoimmunogenic
hiPSCs are created through modulating the expression of human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) so as to avoid
destruction by the host immune system, while providing a healthy endothelium to small diameter grafts. Creation
and investigation of the biomaterial and cellular interactions of mechanically robust, hypoimmunogenic,
endothelialized hiPSC-TEVGs forms the basis of this proposal, and success here will increase the economic and
practical impact of the product through enhancing short term storage capability and reaching an expansive
patient populace. In pursuit of this, expansive validation and characterization will be done on hypoimmunogenic,
universal EC differentiation to produce functionally and mechanically robust ECs for graft engineering.
Decellularized, hypoimmunogenic endothelialized hiPSC-TEVGs will also be generated and biocompatibility of
platelet- and whole blood-luminal surface interactions will be assessed. Further, in vivo immunocompatibility and
therapeutic efficacy of universal hiPSC-TEVGs will be evaluated in a humanized rat aortic interposition graft
model. Information gleaned from this proposal will demonstrate the diversity and practicality of the universal
hiPSC-TEVG technology, and pave the way for future non-human primate, and ultimately clinical utilization of
these grafts for patients with peripheral arterial injury or atherosclerosis."

10917266,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This exploratory project between CNH and Georgetown University leverages the DC-IDDRC
infrastructure and its Neuroimaging, Neurobehavioral and Clinical Translational Cores to test
mechanistic hypotheses about individual differences in the ability to transfer learned knowledge to novel
settings in Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). The history of ASD intervention is rife with poor real-world
outcomes and high heterogeneity in generalization success (1). One known contributing factor is executive
dysfunction, particularly behavioral inflexibility (2, 3). Understanding this nexus of learning and executive function
(4) likely holds the key to resolving the generalization challenge in ASD, but it has received little attention. The
proposed project aims to elucidate the association between learning and flexibility by testing whether
intervening to promote flexible behavior in ASD changes learning and associated neural mechanisms.
The scientific premise of the proposed study is that flexible use of learned concepts depends on generating
prototypes, whereas learning tuned to individual exemplars promotes specificity (5, 6). Current models of concept
learning (7) have used computational modeling of individual generalization performance and model-based
functional magnetic resonance imaging (m-fMRI) to attribute prototype-generation to ventral medial prefrontal
cortex (vmPFC) and exemplar-biased learning to the medial temporal lobes (MTL) (8). We propose that
variability in prototype/exemplar learning mechanisms is associated with behavioral flexibility and
explains differences in adaptive and treatment outcomes. We employ a longitudinal case-controlled design
in 54 14-18 year old youth with ASD at 3 time-points 8 months apart, each including m-fMRI during category
learning and behavioral measurement of executive and adaptive function. Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that
individual variation in learning biases (prototype/exemplar) and their neural correlates predicts
behavioral flexibility (Time1) and is stable over time (Time2). Aim 2 tests plasticity of learning
mechanisms induced by a cognitive-behavioral intervention for flexibility (Unstuck-and-On-Target) that
targets development of prototypical knowledge (9). Intervention will strengthen prototype learning, and
associated vmPFC involvement will be associated with better behavioral response to intervention. Aim 3 tests
hypothesis about intervention-induced plasticity of intrinsic functional connectivity. Stronger resting-
state functional connectivity between MTL and vmPFC specifically and network connectivity of the MTL
subsystem of the default mode network (10) will be associated with prototype learning and intervention response.
Our approach is novel, methodologically in the use of individualized characterization of learning mechanisms,
and theoretically in unifying learning and executive function to explain mechanisms of treatment response and
heterogeneity in treatment outcome in ASD. Findings will inform larger investigations of personalized treatments
for promoting adaptive behavior in ASD."
10918196,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
The T-cell lymphomas (TCL) are an area of unmet medical need as patients, particularly those with relapsed or
refractory disease, are rarely cured with existing therapies. We, and others, have shown that antigen-,
costimulation-, and cytokine-dependent signaling cooperatively promote the growth and survival of malignant T
cells and confers their resistance to conventional chemotherapy. These signaling cascades are propagated by
highly recurrent gain-of-function mutations in relevant kinases and by exogenous ligands provided by
constituents of the tumor microenvironment (TME), including lymphoma-associated macrophages (LAM). Early
phase clinical trials investigating tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKI) selective for relevant targets have been
completed (or are ongoing), but most responses observed with these agents are partial and rarely durable. The
genetic and molecular heterogeneity associated with the TCL and the cooperativity (and partial redundancies)
among signaling pathways may explain the suboptimal activity associated with many targeted agents.
Constituents of the TME, particularly LAM, create a niche that promotes TCL growth and survival both directly,
by providing exogenous ligands for TCL-associated antigen, costimulatory, and cytokine receptors, and
indirectly by suppressing host anti-tumor immunity. Therefore, an alternative, and potentially complementary,
therapeutic approach is to target LAM. Efforts to deplete tumor-associated macrophages have been largely
devoted to colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R) antagonists, as current dogma suggests that this is
the dominant homeostatic cytokine required for the survival of tissue resident macrophages. However, our own
preliminary data challenges this conception, at least in a TCL context. Pexidartinib, for example, is a selective,
and FDA-approved, CSF-1R TKI, to which TCL-associated macrophages are largely resistant. As LAM play a
central role in TCL pathogenesis, one of our long-term goals is to develop novel, targeted therapies that impair
their expansion, survival, and functional polarization. With that goal in mind, we performed an unbiased, high-
throughput screen with almost 200 targeted agents, and discovered that TCL-associated macrophages, while
resistant to multiple selective CSF-1R antagonists, were highly sensitive to pacritinib. Pacritinib is a safe, well
tolerated, oral Janus family kinase (JAK) inhibitor that has been investigated in multiple phase I, II, and III
studies (largely in myeloproliferative neoplasms). In addition to inhibiting multiple JAKs (JAK2, TYK2, JAK3),
we have shown that pacritinib inhibits CSF-1R and Src family kinases at clinically achievable concentrations,
both of which are highly relevant targets in TCL. Therefore, our overarching premise, is that inhibition of
multiple, highly relevant kinases with both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous roles in TCL
pathogenesis is an attractive, but largely unexplored, therapeutic strategy that warrants further investigation.
Our overall objectives in this application are to examine the efficacy of pacritinib and interrogate relevant
predictive and pharmacodynamics biomarkers in an investigator-initiated, multicenter, phase II clinical trial."

Although the development of targeted therapies has improved overall cancer patient survival, adaptive
responses by tumor cells can render these treatments ineffective. The development of agents that block adaptive
responses, thereby increasing treatment durability is desperately needed. We and others have demonstrated
that inhibitors of the transcriptional cyclin-dependent kinases 12 (CDK12) and 13 (CDK13) are strong candidates
to combat acquired drug resistance. The long-term goal of this proposal is to develop a highly effective CDK12/13
inhibitor with an aggregate set of properties suitable to advance as a safety assessment candidate to overcome
therapy resistance in both TNBC and HER2+ breast cancers and KRAS inhibitor-resistant NSCLCs. The overall
objective in this application is to identify targets and pathways altered by treatment-directed CDK12/13 rewiring
and develop new therapeutics that render this rewiring - an exploitable vulnerability. The central hypothesis is
that CDK12/13 acts as a driver of transcriptional and post-transcriptional adaptation and that targeting CDK12/13
will block drug-induced escape and improve treatment response in breast and lung cancer. The rationale for this
project posits that: (i) multiple malignancies hijack CDK12/13 to provoke transcriptional and signaling plasticity
as an adaptive stress resistance mechanism, and (ii) elucidation of mechanisms underpinning compound action
will offer a strong scientific framework that will facilitate future clinical development of these new agents for
improved patient outcome. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three Specific Aims: (1) Optimize
the drug-like properties of in-house CDK12/13 specific inhibitors; (2) Define and validate the mechanisms
whereby CDK12/13 inhibition prevents or reverses treatment resistance in TNBC and HER2+ breast cancers (3)
Define and validate the mechanisms whereby CDK12/13 inhibition prevents or reverses KRASG12C inhibitor
resistance in NSCLC. Accordingly, using a battery of approaches, we will: a) optimize key CDK12/13 inhibitor
parameters to deliver a safety assessment candidate; b) define and validate the transcriptional and translational
mechanisms, whereby SR-4835 provokes resensitization to chemotherapy, and c) validate cell-based
observations in pre-clinical xenograft models. The research approach of our Multi-PI application is innovative,
as our team has developed exceptionally selective and novel small molecule CDK12/13 in vivo active molecular
probes that will enable (i) interrogation of the roles of CDK12/13 during adaptation to treatment resistance (ii)
evaluation that disrupting transcriptional control will counter-resistance mechanisms providing lasting, more
durable anti-cancer responses or even cures; and (iii) understanding of the critical signaling nodes that drive
drug resistance. The proposed research is highly significant and provides a strong scientific rationale for the
continued development of novel CDK12/13 inhibitors. We submit that insight into the molecular underpinnings
of the master effectors of CDK12 and CDK13-driven signaling, together with an optimized CDK12/13 inhibitor
will offer new opportunities for improved combination treatments for breast and lung cancer."
10897007,"PROJECT SUMMARY
People living with HIV (PLWH) are at the higher risk for impaired cognitive functions such as
HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorder or HAND. Further, higher use of legal and illegal
opioids among PLWH could affect their immune functions and exacerbate CNS impairment.
However, little is known about the HIV harboring cell types in brain, effect of ART on specific
CNS cell types, and the modification of brain functions by opioid use. The human brain is
composed of an enormous diversity of cell types defined by distinct gene expression,
morphology, connectivity, and physiology. Single cell sequencing assays enable cell type-
specific analysis of the role of these cell types in healthy brain function and disease. The overall
objective of this proposal is to reveal the single cell determinants of brain relevant to persistent
HIV infection and opioid use disorder using snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq technologies,
bioinformatics approaches, and validation studies. Opioids, as with other addictive drugs, affect
nucleus accumbens (NAc) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) and both of these regions are also
affected by HIV. We put forward an unprecedented concept and experimental system to identify
single cell determinants of brain relevant to persistent HIV infection and opioid use disorder as
well as potential opportunities to illuminate how genetic variation affects gene expression. Our
project has two specific aims: Aim 1: Create a single nucleus transcriptomic atlas of PFC and
NAc. snRNA-seq will be performed on these two regions isolated from post mortem brains. Aim
2: Create a single nucleus epigenomic atlas of PFC and NAc. snATAC-seq will be performed on
these two regions isolated from post mortem brains. Successful completion of these innovative
single-cell studies will generate cellular part list for two NIDA-relevant brain regions, PFC and
NAc, and will illuminate novel insights into transcriptomic and epigenetic landscapes of CNS
and how they are altered by HIV and opioid use."

ously-unappreciated innate immune challenge, complement. The central tenet that guides this work is that un-
derstanding chemotaxis signals will lend new insight into the nature of host-pathogen interactions. A gap re-
mains, however in our understanding of how H. pylori uses lactate to promote complement resistance, how
TlpC integrates lactate and other ligand sensing, and how and where TlpC-mediated sensing promotes in vivo
growth. Continued existence of this gap prevents us from gaining a full understanding of H. pylori’s pathogenic
mechanisms and, in the long term, creating new drugs to thwart these processes. Millions of people worldwide
and in the U.S. are infected by H. pylori and suffer from its associated diseases—ulcers and gastric cancer.
Gastric cancer is the fourth highest cause of cancer deaths worldwide. H. pylori is here to stay based on recent
studies that show H. pylori incidence has stabilized in the developed world. Furthermore, current therapies to
cure H. pylori infection fail with unacceptable frequency, e.g., recent estimates in the United States have found
that 20-25% of infected individuals are not cured by the current therapeutic regime. New drug targets are des-
perately needed. The specific objective of this application is to dissect TlpC signal transduction and the role of
it and its sensed compounds in gastric colonization and disease. Our central hypothesis is that the TlpC-
sensed compounds play fundamental roles in H. pylori colonization, and are sensed cooperatively using both
subdomains of TlpC’s dCACHE ligand binding domain structure. Our hypothesis has been formulated from
preliminary data using crystallization of TlpC, analyzing H. pylori ’s response to lactate and host complement,
and determining the role of chemotaxis and TlpC in vivo. Our approach has three Aims, which combine H. py-
lori molecular biology, mouse models, and high resolution protein crystallography. In Aim 1, we dissect the role
of lactate in H. pylori colonization including how it promotes growth and complement resistance. In Aim 2, we
determine how H. pylori TlpC integrates information from multiple ligands into a chemotaxis response. In Aim
3, we define how chemotaxis underlies in vivo population control. The proposed research is innovative in that it
will create new knowledge about the functions of chemotaxis during bacterial pathogenesis, the role of comple-
ment in the stomach, and high resolution information about how dCACHE ligand binding domains bind ligands.
The proposed research is significant because both in our understanding of H. pylori pathogenesis but also for

10906791,"We propose to develop a probe technology for monitoring human brain function with molecular precision;
in conjunction with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or other imaging modalities, the probes will provide a
combination of sensitivity and resolution that could permit unprecedented noninvasive studies of dynamic neu-
rophysiological processes in people. Our strategy is based on a fundamentally new type of chemical imaging
probe designed to produce neuroimaging readouts by purposefully manipulating endogenous hemodynamic
contrast in the brain—repurposing the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) effect that underlies conventional
functional MRI (fMRI). This new “vasoprobe” concept offers three key advantages: First, by providing time-de-
pendent sensitivity to dilute molecular species such as neurotransmitters, the probes can enable well-defined
neurobiological phenomena to be mapped dynamically across the entire brain, dramatically surpassing existing
nonspecific fMRI approaches. Second, because of the endogenous contrast source they influence, the probes
are detectable on a variety of spatiotemporal scales by noninvasive imaging modalities complementary to fMRI,
such as diffuse optical or ultrasound-based methods. Third, by circumventing limitations of established optical,
magnetic, and radioactive probe designs, vasoprobes combine exquisite sensitivity approaching that of positron
emission tomography (PET) with the resolution and versatility of MRI. In this project, we will build on our recent
proof-of-concept work with vasoprobes to establish noninvasive brain-wide delivery strategies and to develop
robust neurochemical sensors that function in primates. The technology we establish will address multiple goals
in basic and applied neuroscience, and we expect it to yield molecular probes that will be appropriate for clinical
evaluation in human subjects by the end of the project period.
 In Aim 1, we will create vasoprobe variants that can be delivered to the brain via intravenous injection and
spontaneous permeation through the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We will form conjugates of vasoprobe-based
sensors with “brain shuttle” antibodies that have previously been shown to enable brain import via receptor-
mediated transcytosis. Demonstration of brain-permeable vasoprobes will establish a clinically viable path for
facile, noninvasive applications of vasoprobes throughout the brain. In Aim 2, we will optimize vasoprobes to
sense the key neurotransmitters dopamine and glutamate; we will then apply them on a brain-wide scale for
molecular-level fMRI in rodent brains. These experiments, in conjunction with outcome of Aim 1, will set the
stage for applications of neurotransmitter-sensitive vasoprobes and related sensors in primate brains. Accord-
ingly, in Aim 3, we will adapt neurotransmitter-sensitive vasoprobe technology for functional molecular neuroim-
aging in marmosets, a tractable primate species with which we have previous experience. Successful completion
of validation experiments in marmosets will therefore establish groundbreaking imaging agents suitable for trans-
lation to humans, as well as for adaptation to many further neurophysiological targets."
10886788,"Bridging Gaps in the ELSI of Data Science Health Research in Nigeria (BridgELSI)
Project Summary
Data science is poised to impact scientific research, innovation, discovery and healthcare in sub-Saharan Africa
(SSA) because of the rapid growth of infrastructure such as cell phones and computers, and the availability of
technologies like Artificial Intelligence. These methods and resources present huge opportunities to leapfrog
current research, public health and clinical care in Africa by utilizing data science to address the huge burden of
communicable and non-communicable diseases in SSA.
Despite these promises however, there are substantial concerns about the ethical, legal and social implications
(ELSI) of data science research in SSA. These concerns arise from the use of conventional and unconventional
data; the methods for generating, manipulating, storing, sharing and utilizing data in data science; the limitations
of current informed consent models in these scenarios and opportunities for novel strategies for legal oversight
of the ELSI of data science research in Nigeria.
In this collaborative project between the Center for Bioethics and Research (CBR), Nigeria, George Washington
University, DC and University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM), we will evaluate current legal
instruments, guidelines and frameworks, and their implementation, and use these to develop new and innovative
governance frameworks to support data science health research in Nigeria. We will also implement mixed
research methods to prospectively evaluate the knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP) of data scientists and
ethics committees to current and emerging ELSI of data science research in Nigeria. Given the novelty of data
science in Nigeria, we will implement general and specific, short and medium-term training in ethics of data
science research in Nigeria for data science researchers and an introduction to data science for members of
ethics committees reviewing data science research projects."
10909048,"Project Summary: Cardiac allograft rejection (CAR) is a serious concern in transplant medicine, representing
the leading threat to short- and long-term allograft survival. As a result, CAR surveillance and prevention is a
primary focus of post-transplant care, with recipients undergoing frequent, scheduled, surveillance endomyocar-
dial biopsy (EMB) for histologic CAR grading along with frequent, scheduled de-escalation of immunosuppres-
sion (IS). The uniformity of this standardized approach to CAR mitigation is the result of an inability to employ
reliable, proactive, and tailored strategies based on individual CAR risk. Consequently, patients at low CAR risk
are exposed to unnecessary EMB procedures and excess IS therapy, while patients at high risk experience
inadequate CAR surveillance and early/inappropriate weaning of IS. This exposes patients to potential harm,
and highlights the clear, unmet need for precision CAR risk-assessment tools. The overarching premise for this
proposal is that contained within the clinical data and EMB tissues already collected as part of usual care at
transplant centers exists the means to provide actionable CAR risk assessments. Extensive immunologic, diag-
nostic, and pharmacologic data are captured in electronic health records (EHR) at transplant centers, while large
collections of EMB histology samples are stored (and often digitized) in pathology archives. This proposal seeks
to utilize advanced machine-learning algorithms and in-situ diagnostic methods to deeply mine these archival
resources for the purpose of validating novel CAR risk-prediction models. In Aim 1, we will leverage our experi-
ence with automated histologic analysis pipelines to develop a ‘morphologic model’ for predicting future CAR
using archived H&E slides. Hematoxylin-and-Eosin (H&E) histology slides are generated from all EMB events
as part of standard-of-care. In published and patented prior efforts, we have extracted quantitative morphologic
features from digitized H&E slides which, when modeled, demonstrate excellent performance for diagnosing
myocardial injury and CAR grades. In Aim 2, we will move beyond standard H&E, leveraging our experience with
quantitative, in-situ immune-profiling of transplant EMBs to develop a ‘morpho-molecular’ model for predicting
future CAR. This aim will expand upon exciting pilot work which showed the CAR risk-stratification potential of
combining quantitative image-analysis with multiplex immunofluorescence. Finally, in Aim 3, we will develop a
‘histo-informatics’ model for predicting CAR by integrating data from Aims 1 & 2 with comprehensive clinical
informatics data extracted from the EHR. Ultimately, as a result of this work, we expect to validate a novel pre-
cision prediction model for use in prospective investigations exploring personalized CAR surveillance and pre-
vention strategies. Beyond the potential translational impact, this research plan will build on the Applicant’s
knowledge of complex cohort design, integrated data modeling, and transplant immunodiagnostics. Along with
planned coursework and a diverse mentoring, advisory, and collaborative team, this proposal provides the opti-
mal vehicle for Dr. Peyster’s maturation into an investigator with proven expertise in multi-modality diagnostics."
10894089,"Project Summary
Each year, approximately 400 million people are infected with an arboviral disease from the bite of an Aedes
spp mosquito. Aedes spp. mosquitoes are a leading public health threat due to their high competency to vector
multiple pathogens, their preference to bite humans, and their ability to adapt to new domestic environments. In
the US, reintroduction and establishment of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquito populations has
resulted in local epidemics of Zika, dengue and chikungunya in the past decade. Unfortunately, mosquito control
programs in the US generally operate with limited budgets, forcing the majority of insecticide spraying to be
conducted in reaction to population exposure instead of targeted prevention, which has also contributed to
considerable growth of insecticide resistant populations, yielding a widening gap of infrastructure vulnerability.
Our current proposal aims to leverage existing technologies from non-health disciplines to advance mosquito
detection and abatement. We propose to validate the use of technology-driven mosquito traps that allow for high-
throughput identification and counting of Aedes mosquitos at various life stages to inform decision making when
selecting areas for insecticide spraying and abatement. Additionally, we propose to develop rigorous remote
sensing workflows for identification of neighborhood-level Aedes abundance risk and rapid detection of individual
Aedes mosquito breeding habitats on a household-level. This innovative proposal uses multi-year and real-world
mosquito data from two different metropolitan areas to statistically adjust for variances in geographic ecologies,
urban microclimates, seasonal climate patterns, and annual weather events. Our study will result in low-cost
tools immediately ready for broad distribution and integration by vector control agencies nationally. The
outcomes of our study have promise to directly impact vector control agency’s decision-making processes for
mosquito trapping site selection, inform preventative abetment protocols, and shorten the time required for
mosquito collection and identification. Further, integration of our proposed technology traps and informed site
selection maps will increase overall collection volumes while preserving scarce resources for local vector control
agencies. This proposal has the potential to create a paradigm shift in how we approach vector control globally,
with a targeted intervention resulting in significant economic, environmental, and clinical benefits."

 This is an application for a Career Development Award for Dr. Elaine Khoong, an Assistant Professor at
the University of California San Francisco, whose career goal is to be an embedded health system researcher
that applies informatics to conduct interventional implementation research in safety net systems to reduce
disparities in cardiovascular disease. This award will provide her with the training and research experience to:
(1) design a home blood pressure monitoring program tailored for safety net patients and clinicians; (2) pilot
the program to assess implementation and preliminary effectiveness outcomes; and (3) evaluate the cost of
the intervention. To facilitate successful completion of these activities, Dr. Khoong has assembled an ideal
mentoring team comprised of primary mentor, Dr. Urmimala Sarkar, an expert in implementing digital health
solutions to improve chronic disease management in safety net systems and three co-mentors: Dr. Courtney
Lyles, an implementation scientist with expertise in human-centered design and innovation implementation in
safety net systems; Dr. Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo, an expert in cardiovascular epidemiology, health disparities,
and modeling impact of interventions on cardiovascular outcomes; and Dr. Dhruv Kazi, a cardiologist, health
economist, and expert in cost-effectiveness analysis of cardiovascular interventions in low-resourced settings.
 Safety-net health systems, which disproportionately care for low-income or minority populations, play a
pivotal role in achieving national hypertension control and disparities goals. Therefore, it is essential to develop
and test pragmatic solutions that can be used by both patients and clinicians in these systems. Dr. Khoong will
build on findings from previous work that shows (a) usability barriers to adoption of digital tools in low-income
or limited health literate populations and (b) challenges to implementing innovations in safety net systems
when workflows and infrastructure are not considered. In Aim 1, Dr. Khoong will employ human-centered
design techniques to design a home blood pressure monitoring program for use in safety net systems. Dr.
Khoong will lead and evaluate a pilot implementation of the intervention in two urban, safety net clinics within
the safety net system in San Francisco where Dr. Khoong practices as a general internist (Aim 2). The
evaluation will include implementation outcomes, preliminary effectiveness outcomes, and a cost evaluation
(Aim 3), which will provide the foundation and preliminary data to design a larger implementation-effectiveness
trial of the home blood pressure monitoring program, which can be assessed in an R01 proposal.
 Through a focused program of mentored training and coursework, the candidate will gain skills in: (1)
human-centered design; (2) design, implementation, and evaluation of interventions through embedded
research models; and (3) cost-effectiveness analysis. These skills will facilitate Dr. Khoong’s transition to
independence by uniquely positioning her to address patient-, clinician-, and system-level barriers to adoption
and implementation of evidence-based practices to improve cardiovascular outcomes in safety net patients."
10889066,"Dockstore - A Platform for Creating, Sharing, Publishing and Reproducing Computational Science
For science to work analyses, tools and workflows must be reproducible; reproduction is essential to building
consensus and confidence, and improving the state of the art. A large and growing set of scientific methods
are computational in nature, and we can make these computational methods exactly reproducible. Dockstore is
a repository for scientific tools and workflows that provides the means precisely to capture the code,
parameters and operating system environment that are necessary. For tool users it makes it easy to find a
given tool and then run it precisely as the author intended. It is possible to export a tool for use in a cloud
platform, such as NHGRI AnVIL, with a few clicks, or similarly easily download it to an institutional compute
environment, or even a laptop. For tool creators it provides an integrated system to publish versioned scientific
tools with a citable Digital Object Identifier (DOI), linking to containers, existing code repositories and capturing
vital parameter configuration information.
 Dockstore, previously funded by an R01 from NHGRI grant, has grown tremendously over the last four
years. It now has thousands of users, hosts hundreds of tools and workflows, and is used as the methods for
multiple major platforms and projects. Though not technically a renewal, this proposal would provide the core
funding to continue the development and growth of Dockstore, which is a fully open source platform entirely
reliant on grant funding.
 This proposal would grow Dockstore as a resource to make it a hub for broadly sharing computational
science. The aims of the proposal cover foundational infrastructure development (Aim 1), support for sharing
new, popular content types (Aim 2), the expansion of publishing features to make Dockstore more broadly
useful (Aim 3), and a strong focus on training and outreach (Aim 4). The infrastructure development of Aim 1
will increase the scaling and robustness of Dockstore and support Dockstore as a secure, compliant resource,
enabling it to safely host pre-publication tools and workflows working with managed access datasets. It will
integrate Dockstore more deeply with secure cloud platforms, such as the NHGRI AnVIL. The expansion of
content types by Aim 2 will, for example, make it possible to publish programming notebooks on Dockstore.
Such artifacts are widely used but not yet robustly searchable by any scientific resource. Aim 3 will bring
ORCID integration, allowing users to authenticate themselves and then sign and endorse their work, and to
provide open peer review of published tools. Aim 4 will focus on growing and educating the user base via an
expansion of online training material, webinars, in person workshops and collaborations with training for
partner projects using Dockstore. We will also further develop means to continuously acquire user feedback."
10903734,"Project Summary
Human secondary active cation-chloride cotransporters (CCCs) fall into two classes: three Na+-dependent Na+-
(K+)-Cl- (NCC and NKCC1-2) and four Na+-independent K+-Cl− (KCC1-4) transporters. CCCs catalyze
electroneutral symport of Cl- with Na+ and/or K+ across membrane and are fundamental in cell volume regulation,
trans-epithelia ion movement, regulation of intracellular [Cl-]i and neuronal excitability. In the nervous system,
NKCC1 and KCC2 are the major Cl- loader and extruder, respectively, and their opposing actions move [Cl-]i
away from electrochemical equilibrium so that inhibitory neurotransmitters can evoke either inward depolarizing
or outward hyperpolarizing Cl- currents via pentameric ligand-gated ion channels. Mutations in KCC2 or KCC3
cause seizure, epilepsy, and other brain disorders possibly owing to an imbalance in excitatory versus inhibitory
synaptic transmission. Pharmacological tuning of NKCC1 and KCCs transport activities thus represents a
promising therapeutic strategy to restore synaptic inhibition for the treatment of brain disorders. In the kidneys,
NKCC2 and NCC reabsorb ions from the forming urine, balancing electrolytes and blood pressure. CCCs are
regulated by the WNKs-SPAK kinase cascade in response to hormone stimulation and cell volume perturbations,
with N(K)CC activated and KCCs inhibited by phosphorylation. Mutations in NKCC2, NCC, or WNKs and their
upstream E3 ubiquitin ligase regulators lead to hypotensive Gitelman's and Batter's syndromes or hypertensive
Gordon's disease. Loop and thiazide diuretics antagonize NKCC2 and NCC, respectively, and are widely
prescribed for the treatment of hypertension and edema. Building on our success in determining structures of
both NKCC1 and KCC transporters in multiple states, we now propose to determine a series of new CCC
structures using single-particle cryo-EM and to perform complementary biochemical and functional studies to
elucidate: 1) how CCCs alternate between different transport states to shuttle ions across membranes, 2) how
diuretic drugs interact with and inhibit CCCs, and 3) how (de)phosphorylation regulates CCC ion transport
pathways. In parallel, we will also develop and apply cell- and liposome-based flux assays that will accelerate
our CCC functional studies and, ultimately, could support high throughput screening platforms for rapid discovery
of small molecule pharmacological tools to dissect CCC structures/functions and provide drug leads to treat
hypertension, edema, and brain disorders. Our overarching goals are to combine structural, functional, and
pharmacological approaches to understand the inner-workings of CCCs and to facilitate rational targeting of
these transporters for the treatment of numerous human diseases."
10919201,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Drawing on concepts of `emerging infectious disease', the Emerging Products Core (EPC) will provide timely
data to Project Leaders about products whose profile (marketing, social media buzz) or use has increased in
the recent past (12 months) and/or is likely to increase in the near future (12 months). Emerging products may
be completely novel (i.e., a new form of nicotine delivery), a refinement of an existing product (e.g., a new
cigarette variety; a redesign of vaping or heated tobacco product), or a product introduced into a new market
(e.g., a Japanese HTP introduced in the US). The underlying goal of the Core is to centralize the production of
data related to product sale, characteristics, features, and chemical composition that can then feed the projects
within the P01, helping to improve research efficiency. This Core has two Specific Aims: Aim 1 is identify
emerging tobacco and nicotine products. Using multiple modes and data sources (INPAM surveys, web
scraping, social media rapid scans (e.g., Twitter), marketing reports (Nielsen and tobacco companies), stock
analyst reports, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, patents submitted by and granted to
tobacco companies), we will identify and track emerging products, changes in sale/availability/prices of
products, and changes in products (e.g., new versions) in each country. We will focus on those emerging
products where evidence already exists of uptake, or products that have a strong likelihood of uptake among
youth and/or long-term smokers based on social media `buzz,' test marketing, advertising, and changes in
marketing or availability due to regulatory action. Aim 2 is to characterize design, labelling, contents, and
emissions of emerging products by category and country. Our focus will be on emergent products identified in
Aim 1 to determine, through physical and chemical analyses of the product, whether product design, chemical
ingredients, emissions, and/or performance differs and potentially is calibrated to specific regulations and
hence differ across jurisdictions with different policies. Results generated by the EPC can help to develop
survey items (Projects 1 and 2) to better adopt to the dynamically changing marketplace and provide context to
experimental or modeling studies (Projects 3 and 4). The EPC will make sure that information about products
is current and data is consistent across projects. We also expect that this data will be useful to WHO, FDA, and
other national and state regulators. Finally, we expect that data generated by EPC will be useful to researchers
outside of the P01 who can use this information to consider the impact of regulatory activities on product
popularity and its characteristics."

monthly teleconference and will be responsible for internal planning, execution, and assessment of the
Partnership activities. The IAC, consisting of six leaders (two from each Partnering institution), reviews, twice a
year, the Partnership’s progress and decisions and guides the overall Partnership. The PSC, consisting of five
external members, whose expertise covers all areas of the proposed research programs, and an NCI-official as
an ex-officio member, functions as the external review body, which annually evaluates all components of the
Partnership’s progress and provides guidance. Further, together with Planning and Evaluation Core, a Scientific
Review Committee, consisting of all PIs and a science editor, will solicit pilot projects to be funded in years 4 and
5 of the funding cycle and assigns them to external reviewers to assess their scientific merit and funds them after
obtaining approvals from PSC. The expertise of the PIs of all three institutions is complementary to each other,
and most of these leaders have been productively working together for more than 10 years. Together with
Administrative/Finance Officers of the respective institutions, the Program Managers aid the Partnership by
providing day-to-day administrative support, coordination, preparation of the annual progress reports, and
logistical services needed to accomplish the Partnership functions. Additionally, the Presidents and PIs of all
three institutions will continue to conduct yearly joint video conferences to discuss progress of the Partnership
and to reaffirm their continued commitment to strengthen, integrate, and expand Partnership activities."
10925331,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: ADMINISTRATIVE CORE 
In this competing renewal application, we propose to continue support of the longstanding Meharry Medical 
College/Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center/Tennessee State Cancer Partnership (MVTCP) that promotes a 
balanced focus on basic, clinical and population science research to eliminate cancer disparities. The 
Administrative Core (AC), as a team from all three institutions, are jointly responsible for supporting all MVTCP 
components and investigators through overall management and coordination of resources, communication and 
engagement. Importantly, the AC fosters, manages and supports interactions among and within the partner 
institutions, components and investigators, internal and external advisory committees, and the National Cancer 
Institute (NCI). The administrative teams from the partner institutions interact and collaborate extensively to 
enhance productivity and support the needs of the MVTCP. The AC is comprised of the Principal Investigators 
(PIs) from all three institutions, Samuel Adunyah, PhD [Meharry Medical College (MMC), contact PI], Duane 
Smoot, MD (MMC, Co-PI), Tuya Pal, MD [Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center (VICC), contact PI], Ann Richmond, 
PhD (VICC, Co-PI), Margaret Whalen, PhD [Tennessee State University (TSU), contact PI], and Venkataswarup 
Tiriveedhi, MD, PhD (TSU, Co-PI). An experienced administrative team from each institution provides day-to- 
day administrative oversight and supports the PIs and the Partnership. Through effective leadership, the AC 
team 1) provides vision and support as well as implements the overall direction of the Partnership; 2) facilitates 
new and ongoing review processes of Research projects funded through the Partnership; 3) ensures, promotes 
and actively coordinates integration and synergy across the Cores and Shared Resources to support the projects 
and grow additional disparities-focused efforts; 4) collaborates with institutional leadership to ensure appropriate 
levels of institutional support; and 5) coordinates and prepares required annual reports and any additional 
required reporting and data for the NCI, in close coordination with the Planning and Evaluation Core. The AC 
develops and coordinates activities in support of planning and evaluation, engages in faculty recruitment and 
mentoring, develops and executes workshops, seminars, and the Annual MVTCP Cancer Health Disparities 
Symposium. To ensure fulfillment of the goals of the MVTCP, the AC engages regularly with the Internal Advisory 
Committee (IAC), Program Steering Committee (PSC), NCI leadership, Partnership Cores, Shared Resources, 
and funded Research Projects. The AC is committed to providing necessary leadership and services to support 
efficient working relationships across and within the Partnership, with senior institutional leaders and other key 
personnel, as well as with the PSC and NCI. The AC team shares the belief that this Partnership is at a critical 
juncture in its maturation and have worked together to develop strategic initiatives and an implementation 
strategy for the next phase of growth and development to fulfill its mission to Eliminate Cancer Health Disparities."

(This Core is identical for all three Partnering Institutions)
The Partnership between the Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM), Tuskegee University (TU), and the
University of Alabama at Birmingham O’Neal Comprehensive Cancer Center (UAB OCCC) presents a distinct
opportunity to build on our accomplishments in education of future cancer research scientists, with an emphasis
on underrepresented racial/ethnic minorities, and to advance cancer research at all three institutions with a focus
on cancer disparities in the context of a bidirectional engagement with urban and rural communities in Alabama
and Georgia. For this U54 Partnership, evaluation will be conducted by a team of evaluators representing each
partnering institution, who meet monthly to discuss progress, issues, and solutions: Dr. Isabel Scarinci and Ms.
Sylvia Peral (UAB OCCC), Dr. Desiree Rivers (MSM), and Mr. Lecarde Webb (TU). Although they will work
together, each will be primarily responsible for specific Cores and Shared Resources. This team makes
recommendations to be implemented administratively by the Principal Investigators with the advice, guidance,
and direction of each institution’s Executive Committee, the Partnership Leadership Committee (PLC), the
Internal Advisory Committee (IAC), and the Program Steering Committee (PSC). Each Core, Research Project,
and Shared Resource of this Partnership will have its own evaluation plan/worksheet outlining the evaluation
questions for each specific aim, tasks, data collection tools, the person responsible for each task, and timeline.
Process evaluation results will be discussed monthly at the PLC meetings, and comprehensive yearly written
reports will be shared with the IAC and PSC for feedback and guidance. It should be noted that, although each
component will have its own evaluation plan, an integrated evaluation process will be conducted to synergize all
components to achieve the long-term goal of eliminating cancer health disparities."
10925295,"PROGRAM SUMMARY: RESEARCH EDUCATION CORE
(This Core is identical for all three Partnering Institutions)
The Partnership between Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM)/Tuskegee University (TU)/University of
Alabama at Birmingham O’Neal Comprehensive Cancer Center (MSM/TU/UAB OCCC) presents a distinctive
opportunity to build on our successful accomplishments in education of future cancer research scientists moving
through our pipeline, with an emphasis on underrepresented racial/ethnic minorities. In this U54 renewal
application, we propose a seamless integration of our cancer education programs by focusing on “hard”
(structured courses/training developed through previous U54 funding) and “soft” skills (e.g., career
development roadmap, interviewing skills) needed to facilitate movement through our pipeline into the cancer
research continuum, with the goal of having a diverse workforce in cancer research. This will be accomplished
through the following specific aims: Aim 1. To develop and implement integrated cancer research education
programs to link high school, undergraduate, and graduate/medical students with postdoctoral fellows, medical
residents, and Early Stage Investigators (ESIs), and senior-level researchers/mentors with a particular focus on
underrepresented racial/ethnic minorities in science. Four integrated programs will be utilized: (a) the Granting
Research Opportunities in Wellness by Creating Exciting Learning Laboratories in Science (GROW CELLS)
for high school students; (b) the Cancer Research Immersion Student Program (CRISP) for undergraduate
students; (c) the Summer Cancer Research Education Program (SCREP) for graduate and medical students;
and (d) the Health Disparities Research Education Program (HDREP) for medical residents, postdoctoral
fellows, and ESIs. Aim 2. To link all levels of cancer research scholars with the Outreach Core to share their
research findings with community members, obtain community feedback on relevant topics for future research
(e.g., Cancer Info Cafés), and develop publications and communications for lay audiences (e.g., blogs or posts
on social media, YouTube videos, policy briefs). Aim 3. To implement a mixed-method, triangulated evaluation
of the proposed research education activities across the pipeline. These efforts will increase the recruitment and
retention of underrepresented minorities in science, specifically in cancer research, that are congruent with the
goals expressed in the NIH’s Interest in Diversity Statement."
10928131,"APSA ANNUAL MEETING PROJECT SUMMARY
Due to their unique training in both biomedical research and clinical medicine, physician-scientists serve an
important role in dissecting the pathophysiology of human disease to develop new treatment modalities for
patient care, which is integral to the continued success of the scientific enterprise. Physician-scientists also
provide a critical pipeline for faculty and leaders in academic medicine. In June 2014, the National Institutes of
Health (NIH) Physician-Scientist Workforce (PSW) Working Group released a report detailing the present state
and projected future of the PSW. In addition to the overall small number of physicians pursuing research
(1.5%), the constituency of the workforce is aging (average age at first R01 is 44 for MD-PhDs), lacking in
underrepresented minority (URM) representation, and is being fed by a lengthening pipeline. Therefore, it is
increasingly important to recruit and support trainees who are not only competitive, but resilient and diverse.
The American Physician Scientists Association (APSA) and the APSA Annual Meeting (AM) were created to
foster and strengthen the national community of physician-scientist trainees, as no pre-existing venue
encompassed all members of this trainee community. Organized in conjunction with the annual meetings of the
Association of American Physicians (AAP) and the American Society of Clinical Investigation (ASCI), the APSA
AM is truly unique in that it unites physician-scientists at all phases of the career spectrum, from aspiring
undergraduates, to current trainees, residents, and fellows. Since its inception in 2005, the APSA AM has
grown in services provided and total participants, boasting an average of 350 participants over the past four
years. The conference provides a structured environment to disseminate career advice from established
physician-scientists in all career sectors, to promote the development of mentoring relationships, and to
foster community building amongst physician-scientist trainees. Moreover, the APSA Annual Meeting provides
a critical venue at which issues faced by trainees, including those from under-represented groups, can be
discussed and addressed with senior physician-scientist leaders. This application seeks funds to specifically
enhance the diversity of APSA Annual Meeting attendees by providing travel awards for individuals from racial
and ethnic groups that are underrepresented in health-related sciences, individuals with disabilities, and
undergraduate students from disadvantaged backgrounds, and supporting costs associated with hosting
speakers and panelists that address issues of diversity."
10846677,"Influenza is a leading cause of death in the US with a staggering economic burden. Interferons
serve as a critical response to this virus triggering elaboration of host defense molecules within
alveolar macrophages. A relatively new and unchartered area in interferon biology involves
interferon lamda (IFN) acting through its cognate receptor, IFNLR1, to mediate anti-viral
defense. Loss of IFNLR1 leads to viral dissemination and death in experimental influenza. The
mechanistic platform of this proposal resides on our discovery of a unique molecular model
whereby a protein, Fbxo45, rapidly impairs host defense by mediating ubiquitin-driven disposal
of this crucial cytoprotective, anti-viral receptor, IFNLR1. Hence, in this application we will first
elucidate how short-term influenza infection depletes IFNLR1 through Fbxo45, thereby
accentuating experimental viral lung injury (Aim 1). We will specifically elucidate how Fbxo45
targets IFNLR1 for its degradation using complementary in vitro and in vivo genetic models.
Next, after sustained influenza infection we observed that IFNLR1 mRNA levels increase in
macrophages, perhaps as a compensatory host defense mechanism. Here we will assess
novel post-transcriptional mechanisms mediated by microRNA acting on the 3’UTR of the
IFNLR1 gene (Aim 2). These studies will provide a new pathobiologic model of lung injury that
will serve as a platform for unveiling new molecular insight into the IFN- IFNLR1 axis that is
indispensable to resolve inflammatory injury in subjects with severe virally-driven critical illness."
10909172,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Over the past 10 years, our group has made multi-disciplinary efforts to bridge the technological gap between
radiation methods for human treatment and pre-clinical research. We employed the Bioengineering Research
Partnership mechanism to construct an advanced small animal radiation research platform (SARRP). The
SARRP is equipped with cone-beam CT (CBCT) to guide focal irradiation and was commercialized by Xstrahl
in 2010. The system was transformative for pre-clinical radiation research as 66 machines are now in use
world-wide by > 300 investigators. Recognizing that CBCT imaging is inadequate for localizing tumor models
growing in a low image contrast environment, we developed bioluminescence tomography (BLT) on board the
SARRP to complement CBCT guidance. The effort was supported by the previous academic-industrial
partnership (AIP) mechanism. The BLT utility is the “first” to localize the center of mass (CoM) of an optical
target for irradiation. Although the success of this partnership led to the commercialization of the BLT system
by Xstrahl in 2016, the adoption of the BLT platform by users is lackluster. It is clear that investigators highly
desire the ability to define the 3D shape of the target volume on the SARRP to fully complement modern
human treatment. It becomes imperative that we need to advance BLT guidance to a new level of 3D target
shape delineation beyond CoM and to allow quantitative assessment of target response to radiation. On-board
PET imaging has been introduced to enable biology-guided RT in humans. Small animal radiation research
would also be greatly enhanced with capabilities of biologic and functional targeting and assessment beyond
anatomy. Fluorescence tomography (FT) would allow in-depth biological and mechanistic interrogation of key
information about the tumor and its microenvironment response to RT. It complements bioluminescence
imaging to study tumor and normal tissue response, when the use of engineered bioluminescent models is not
available. The research potentials of FT are particularly significant when considering combinational molecular
therapeutic strategies with radiation, such as immunotherapy. Fluorescence imaging also has an added
advantage to be amenable to clinical translation as a surrogate for PET imaging. Integrated CBCT/BLT/FT
capabilities that complements the SARRP would provide a powerful platform for pre-clinical radiation research.
Xstrahl and the Johns Hopkins team will continue the partnership to develop and commercialize these new
capabilities. Our aims are (1). Design and construct a new advanced BLT/FT system to guide irradiation on-
board the SARRP and for off-line imaging studies, (2). Develop quantitative BLT/FT for target volume
determination and treatment assessment, (3). Assess and validate the optical system performance with
phantom and in vivo model. The successful dissemination of new advanced molecular optical imaging
capabilities significantly enhances the conduct of radiation research for the SARRP users."
10796833,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Drug overdose deaths continue to rise in the United States, accounting for over 100,000 deaths in 2021 alone.
Methamphetamine and opioid co-use are largely fueling the most recent increase in mortality. In addition, co-
use associated hospital admissions increased more than five-fold between 2003 and 2015.
Previous research and hospital-based addiction services for substance use have focused on opioid use alone.
These addiction medicine services have increased rates of medication for opioid use disorder and improved
patient linkage to continuing outpatient treatment. As a result, hospital length of stay and readmission rates
have decreased. However, past research indicates individuals with co-use have different sociodemographic
and health profiles and are less likely to receive medication for opioid use disorder than individuals who use
opioids alone. There is limited evidence of how existing hospital-based addiction services effect patients who
co-use methamphetamine and opioids or how these services could be tailored to better treat hospitalized
patients with co-use.
The overall objective of this Kirschstein-NRSA F30 fellowship is to generate evidence that can guide the
eventual development, implementation, and evaluation of hospital addiction medicine treatment services
tailored to co-use. The specific aims of this proposal are: 1) to characterize patient demographics and
hospitalization characteristics associated with co-use from a nationally representative sample of inpatient
hospitalizations, 2) to quantify the risk of re-admission and mortality following hospital discharge, by substance
use profile, and whether differences vary by the receipt of hospital-based addiction services and 3) to identify
barriers and facilitators to providing hospital-based addiction services tailored for patients with co-use.
The proposed mixed methods project is based on a sequential explanatory approach. It includes training in
both quantitative (Aims 1 & 2) and qualitative (Aim 3) research methodologies. Through this work and a
thoughtfully designed training plan, the trainee will achieve the following goals: 1) develop health services
research expertise, 2) advance the substance use research field as it relates to polysubstance use, 3) integrate
research, clinical, and advocacy activities in the field of addiction medicine. This supports his long-term goal of
bridging health services research and clinical medicine to support patients with substance use disorders as a
physician-researcher."
10825433,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Astrocytes influence neuronal circuit assembly and function and have been shown to respond, modulate, and
drive disease pathogenesis. Despite this, relatively little is known about astrocyte diversity across brain regions,
development, and species. However, recent single-cell RNA sequencing studies demonstrate that astrocytes
have significant transcriptomic heterogeneity across the brain. Detailed molecular and cellular characterization
of these subpopulations is needed to determine whether molecularly-defined astrocyte subpopulations serve
distinct functions in both health and disease. Thus, the goal of this project is to use cutting-edge techniques to
characterize the transcriptomic, structural, and functional diversity of astrocyte subpopulations across
developmental stages and disease-relevant brain regions in the mouse and marmoset brain. By conducting a
detailed analysis of over 70,000 astrocyte nuclei across eight brain regions in the young adult marmoset, I have
discovered striking regional heterogeneity among astrocytes, particularly between cortical and subcortical
regions. In this proposal, I aim to make three significant advances: a) map the evolution of astrocyte regional
heterogeneity across development, b) compare this heterogeneity between rodent and non-human primate
species, and c) characterize the functional identities of transcriptomically distinct astrocyte subtypes. To address
the first two of these, I will conduct single-nucleus RNA sequencing of four brain regions in the embryo, neonate,
juvenile, and adolescent marmoset and mouse. To address the third, I will use expansion microscopy to assess
whether molecularly-defined astrocyte subtypes have distinct morphologies, ensheathment of synapses, and/or
configuration of ion channels at the nanoscale. Additionally, I will image astrocyte calcium dynamics, considered
key components of signaling processes used by astrocytes to regulate neuronal networks, in acute brain slices
from both mouse and marmoset to characterize the functional diversity of transcriptomically-defined astrocyte
subtypes. The proposed study will mark the first cross-species, cross-development, cross-region molecular
profile of brain cells using consistent experimental and computational methodology, and will create new
knowledge about the development of astrocyte heterogeneity across brain regions in rodents and non-human
primates. Importantly, this detailed molecular and cellular characterization of astrocyte subpopulations will
facilitate their precise manipulation for basic and translational research on neurodevelopmental and psychiatric
disorders. I will carry out this project in the labs of Dr. Guoping Feng and Dr. Ed Boyden in the Brain and Cognitive
Sciences Department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The Feng and Boyden labs contain all
required equipment for the proposed project. All necessary training regarding required laboratory and
computational techniques will be provided by senior lab members or through collaboration with other labs in BCS
and external collaborators. The Feng and Boyden labs, BCS, and MIT offer exceptional scientific and
professional development resources to facilitate my successful transition into a postdoctoral fellowship."
10896241,"Instrumentation and Fabrication Core Resource for Vision Sciences,
Ronald Silverman, Core Director
Summary/Abstract
The long-term goal of the Core is to provide mechanical design and fabrication support for vision research at
Columbia, especially that of investigators with RO1 grants and young investigators gathering data for their
first successful RO1s. State-of-the-art vision research is dependent upon the development of new
technology and the improvement of current technology. The Core supports a specially dedicated machine
shop and one machinist. Because the shop is in-house, and the machinist is familiar with demands of vision
research, designing new equipment is far more efficient than it would be with a University or commercial
shop. The core has four specific aims: 1)To design and build custom equipment necessary for vision
research, both systems neuroscience vision research and ophthalmic science. 2)To provide emergency
repairs and modifications for equipment currently in use for vision research. 3)To train students and
postdoctoral fellows in the most effective ways to collaborate with instrument designers. 4)To encourage
collaboration among vision research investigators, having them share ideas for new devices that might be
used in multiple laboratories. This is especially important for systems neuroscience vision research, where
similar equipment is used to answer vastly different scientific questions. Collaboration in instrument design
has often led to scientific collaboration. The Core builds the standard devices used for systems neuroscience
such as recording chambers, primate chairs and grids. Although some of these devices are available
commercially, the ones built by the Core are far more durable. Examples of custom equipment built by the
Core are cage mounted behavioral training systems to train monkeys in their home cage rather than using
rig time; a system for lifting a monkey chair to the cage opening to facilitate transfer from the cage to the
chair; a 3D ultrasound probe manipulator for blood flow studies in rat eyes. This now successful prototype
will be expanded for use in humans."
10896243,"Summary/Abstract
 The role of the Computer Core is to provide specialized computer services to vision scientists throughout
Columbia University, with priority given to investigators supported by NEI RO1 grants. Computer technology is
critical to all modern visual science: database management, genetic and neuroscientific computation, reliable
data storage, and serving as on-line adjuncts to laboratory instruments, and the Core facilitates all of these
processes. The Core has 2 major components: 1) the Harkness Eye Institute (HEI) site, which includes: A. The
Genomics Analysis Suite, B. The databases and server center, C. Computing and programming services; and
2) the Zuckerman Mind, Brain, and Behavior Institute (ZMBBI), where the Core provides real-time software and
hardware components for visual systems neuroscience.
 Although the University provides standard PC backup (e.g. support for Windows and Microsoft Office),
visual systems neuroscience requires much more sophisticated support. In systems neuroscience rather than
performing an isolated data analysis function, computers are integrated into the experimental apparatus itself,
performing a number of functions in real time, such as controlling the animal’s behavior, measuring eye
movement and arm movement, collecting single neuron activity, and doing preliminary data analysis. This
requires special real-time operating systems, usually beyond the ability of the University PC technicians, and
special interfaces to enable an efficient interface between the experimental apparatus and the computer.
Because the Zuckerman Institute now provides server and off-site backup facilities, this frees up the Core for
more creative computer interface development, for example to facilitate the new development of multiple single
neuron recording, including the adaptation of high speed graphics cards to physiological recording, areas beyond
the expertise of the ZMBBI computer team. The Core will also provide emergency computer backup when the
ZMBBI team is unavailable.
 The Harkness Eye Institute is heavily reliant on SQL databases and programming, again a capability
beyond that of the University computer technicians. The new component of the Computer core at the HEI is the
innovative Genomics Analysis Suite, which will provide integrated data management and analysis capabilities
for genetic and imaging data. The Core will also foster collaborations among the group of visual systems
investigators themselves, and also between experimental vision scientists and computational neuroscientists at
the ZMBBI’s Center for Theoretical Neuroscience. At HEI it will enable a number of collaborations between
vision scientists and scientists new to vision research."

Cell-state variation in cancer is important for tumor initiation–progression and creates a major hurdle to
effective anticancer therapeutics. Unbiased methods are needed to monitor single-cell regulatory states of
cancer cells in situ, as are approaches to analyze these data and generate actionable hypotheses about
cancer biology. This R50 Research Scientist application will support the activities of Dr. Lixin Wang, a 11-year
Research Scientist in the Unit directed by Dr. Kevin Janes, who is an expert in 10-cell transcriptomic profiling
by laser-capture microdissection (LCM). Dr. Wang is a co-developer of LCM-based 10-cell RNA sequencing
(10cRNA-seq; Sci Rep 2019) and is deeply involved in two NCI-sponsored projects (U01-CA215794 and R01-
CA214718) that stem from the technology. As the lead experimentalist for a U01 cooperative agreement
through the Cancer Systems Biology Consortium, Dr. Wang will perform molecular-genetic perturbations,
epigenomic studies, and in vivo tests of nucleocytoplasmic regulatory states that arise when breast epithelial
cells acutely activate the ERBB2 receptor tyrosine kinase. Dr. Wang will support the R01 research project on a
heterogeneously regulated tumor-suppressive ligand by training predoctoral students on 3D culture, molecular
cloning, intraductal xenografts, and regulatory compliance. In the past, Dr. Wang has collaborated effectively
with chemists and mouse geneticists at the University of Virginia (UVA) Cancer Center, all of whom strongly
support this R50 application. An R50 award would ensure successful completion of the U01–R01 aims and
enable Dr. Wang’s expertise to propagate more broadly within the NCI-supported research activity of the UVA
Cancer Center."
10911239,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Electronic cigarette (EC) use is projected to exceed cigarette smoking within two years. Nicotine salt-based
ECs have raised concerns due to their high concentrations of nicotine, potentially contributing to their rapidly
increasing popularity. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has regulatory authority over ECs and has
shown interest in exploring a product standard to limit the allowable level of nicotine in EC e-liquids. While the
proposed product standard has merit, emerging research suggests that it could lead to a product that is just as
addictive but more harmful, particularly to African American (AA) smokers. AA smokers bear a disproportionate
burden of smoking-related diseases and represent an understudied population with a propensity to use
products in a way that is different compared to the majority population. AA smokers take larger puffs and inhale
more intensely on cigarettes than whites. While AA smoke fewer cigarettes per day than whites, AA extract
30% more nicotine per cigarette and higher levels of non-nicotine toxicants per cigarette. As more AA smokers
switch to ECs, it is not known how they will use these products. No studies have investigated how rates of
compensatory puffing when using ECs differ as a function of nicotine concentration among AA and white
smokers or how the nicotine concentration of e-liquids could influence their rates of compensation, substitution,
and EC-related toxicant exposure. The proposed study will provide this scientific evidence to inform regulation
and to maximize public health benefit and limit potential harm to diverse users. Adults smokers (24 AA, 24 W)
will complete two study phases. In Phase 1, participants will complete two standardized, 10-puff vaping bouts
followed by a 60-minute ad libitum vaping session, using two e-liquids that differ only by nicotine concentration
(5% vs. 1.8%). Phase 1 will provide objective data regarding rates of compensation as a function of nicotine
concentration. In Phase 2, the same participants will be randomized to 5% or 1.8% nicotine e-liquid and
instructed to switch to them completely for 6 weeks. The randomized trial will allow us to understand the
comparative efficacy of 1.8% vs. 5% nicotine e-liquid on substitution rates and adverse health outcomes,
including exposure to non-nicotine constituents, in the short-term under real-world use conditions. If reduced
nicotine ECs were to result in greater e-liquid consumption via compensation, reduced substitution rates,
and/or greater exposure to toxicants, then this would suggest that a nicotine product standard placing a limit on
allowable levels of nicotine in e-liquid would lead to a product that is just as addictive but possibly more
harmful. This innovative study will provide the scientific foundation needed to establish effective regulatory
strategies for nicotine product standards that optimize public health. The project will serve as an incredibly
valuable training experience and will establish the K01 candidate, Dr. Eleanor Leavens, as an independent
tobacco regulatory scientist and launch Dr. Leavens’ career in substantial and measurable ways."
10918074,"Project Summary
During mitosis, the mother cell divides by the formation of a cleavage furrow, leaving two daughter cells
connected by a thin intercellular bridge. The resolution of this bridge, abscission, leads to the separation of the
two daughter cells. During ingression of the cleavage furrow, the central spindle microtubules are compacted
to form a structure known as the midbody (MB). It is now well established that MB regulates cytokinesis by
recruiting abscission-mediating proteins, such as ESCRT complex, as well as several regulators of abscission
checkpoint. Until recently, the MB was thought to be discarded after division by releasing it into extracellular
space. However, recently it was shown that MBs accumulate in stem and cancer cells after mitosis has been
completed (called MBsomes) and it has been proposed that MBsomes function as novel signalling platforms
that regulate cell differentiation and proliferation. Recently we developed a protocol for purification of post-
mitotic MBs and completed their proteomic and RNAseq analyses that led to identification of several mRNAs
and mRNA-binding proteins that accumulate at the MB. Importantly, MB-enriched mRNAs encode several
ESCRT complex subunits, as well as proteins that stimulate cell proliferation. Furthermore, we show that these
MB-enriched mRNAs can be transferred to the neighboring cells via post-mitotic MB internalization. Based on
all of these findings, we hypothesize that targeting of selected mRNAs to the MB during cytokinesis play
a key role in regulating cell abcission and post-mitotic MBsome signaling. Here we propose three
specific aims to test this hypothesis. First, we will map and characterize the domain(s) within 3'-UTR that are
needed for mRNA targeting during cytokinesis. We will then use candidate approach, as well as proteomic and
CRISPR screens, to identify RNA-binding proteins that interact with these 3”-UTR domains and regulate
mRNA targeting and localized translation at the MB. Second, we will test the possibility that MB
accumulation/translation of ESCRT mRNAs mediates ESCRP complex targeting to the MB. Third, we will test
whether MBsome-dependent transfer of specific mRNAs, such as mRNA encoding proliferation regulator
CENP-E contribute to MBsome-induced cell proliferation."
10894732,"Project Summary
Radiotherapy is a standard modality for brain lesions, and has led improvements in patient outcome through
the addition of high precision stereotactic delivery and more recently particle therapy. While patients are
benefiting from increasing survival times, cognitive complications develop with increased frequency and are
thus challenging treatment paradigms. Biologically, the mechanisms of neurotoxicity from ionizing radiation
are unclear. Recent studies have highlighted exquisite sensitivity to an organ that has been traditionally
thought to be radioresistant due to its non-proliferative nature. Dendrite remodeling, neuroinflammation, and
excitotoxicity are all elevated following exposure to ionizing radiation, and are thought to contribute to
decreased cognition. In the current application, we propose that excessive glutamate signaling is a key driver
of cognitive damage from radiation. In addition, our group has been investigating the role of the polyamine
pathway in radiation resistance of tumor cells. Both glutamate and polyamines are found to be elevated in
brain tumors, an induced secretion is evident after exposure to radiation. In mechanistic studies, we implicate
the NMDAR NR2B subunit as a specific target of glutamate and polyamines that leads to neurotoxicity. We
hypothesize that blocking glutamate-receptor signaling with a specific glutamate receptor antagonist will
reduce CNS damage due to radiation, and sensitize tumor cells to radiation induced death, and therefore
improve patient outcomes."
10913339,"Project Summary:
The endothelin (ET) system of vasoactive peptides (comprising of ET-1, ET-2 and ET-3) and their G protein
coupled receptors (ETA and ETB receptors) have been found to be elevated in animal models of glaucoma.
Corroborative findings from several laboratories have demonstrated that ET-1 acting through both vascular and
cellular mechanisms produces neurodegenerative effects in glaucoma. ET-1 mediates these effect through
activation of the ETA and ETB receptors, leading to optic nerve degeneration and retinal ganglion cell death. These
findings bring up exciting possibilities for neuroprotection by using agents that block endothelin receptors.
However, the mechanisms by which endothelin receptor activation contributes to neurodegeneration in glaucoma
is poorly understood. Preliminary data included in this application indicates that a reduction in mitophagy is a key
event that occurs during IOP elevation in Brown Norway rats, as well as following treatment of RGCs with ET-1.
Novel mechanisms involved in ET-1 mediated decline in autophagy will be addressed in the proposal with the
following specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Determine if endothelin-1 (ET-1) acting through its receptors decreases
mitophagy in retinal ganglion cells. Specific Aim 2: Elucidate mechanisms contributing to decreased mitophagy
in retinal ganglion cells following IOP elevation in rodents. Specific Aim 3: Determine the mitochondrial
mechanisms contributing to the neuroprotective effects of endothelin receptor antagonists in IOP elevated rats.
The innovative aspects of the project include an in-depth assessment of ET-1 mediated autophagy and high-
resolution imaging studies, using super-resolution and 2-photon confocal microscopy, to understand the
dynamics of mitophagy (a quality control mechanism for mitochondria) which is compromised in glaucoma. The
project will also generate possibilities for pharmacological interventions to block endothelin receptors, thereby
promote neuroprotection of RGCs and their axons. A major highlight of the application is the development of
neuroprotective strategies using macitentan, a FDA approved drug, which has the potential to be rapidly
transitioned from the bench to the bedside for the treatment of glaucoma. This will greatly facilitate the
development of a neuroprotective treatment of glaucoma, which is much needed to slow down the progression
of visual impairment that occurs in some glaucoma patients, despite aggressively lowering IOP."

high risk for vision loss. This allows for the rational use of medical, laser, and surgical treatments. Current
methods of assessing glaucoma have significant limitations. Visual field (VF) testing has a low sensitivity for
detecting early disease, and its reproducibility worsens in advanced stages, reducing its reliability for
monitoring disease progression. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) precisely measure the peripapillary
nerve fiber layer (NFL) thickness and is the most commonly used technology for objective glaucoma
evaluation. However, NFL thickness has limited sensitivity in detecting early glaucoma, and reaches a floor
value in moderate glaucoma, which prevents it from tracking glaucoma progress into later stages. The goal of
the proposed research is to develop advanced OCT technology that will enhance detection of early glaucoma,
improve the sensitivity of detecting significant disease progression, and increase the accuracy of measuring
progression speed. The Specific Aims are:
1. Develop a directional high-resolution OCT and OCT angiography prototype to improve imaging of
 structure and perfusion. The prototype will have real-time control of beam direction to maintain
 perpendicular incidence on the NFL for accurate reflectance analysis, which has shown promise for very
 sensitive detection of early glaucoma. Sensorless adaptive-optics aberration correction will enable high
 transverse resolution to enhance the detection of nerve fiber bundle and capillary defects. Ultrahigh axial
 resolution will enable assessment of the pentalaminar structure of the inner plexiform layer.
2. Wide-field OCT and OCT angiography analyses and visual field simulation. Wide peripapillary and
 macular scans, using a next-generation commercial spectral-domain OCT system, will allow visualization of
 nerve fiber and perfusion defects from the disc margin to temporal raphe, thus improving early glaucoma
 detection. VF simulation will be performed to convert OCTA perfusion measurement to a VF-equivlaent dB-
 scale familiar to clinicians for monitoring progression. The simulation has higher reproducibility than actual
 VF, which improves detection of disease progression and measurement of progression speed.
3. Clinical studies in glaucoma diagnosis and monitoring. The clinical study will test whether the
 proposed new technologies can improve the detection of pre-perimetric glaucoma, detection of disease
 progression, and the accuracy of measuring the speed of progression.
This research is likely to transform the clinical practice of glaucoma by developing novel objective functional
and structural tests that can be practically implemented on the next generation of clinical OCT systems. This
will save vision by achieving accurate diagnosis in early glacuoma and timely intervention in rapid progressors."
10917202,"CORE C: PROGRAM SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
There are significant disparities that influence prevalence, complications, and outcomes in diabetes. The
Southeastern U.S. represents an important intersection of health and social vulnerability where populations
disproportionately affected by diabetes tend to be defined by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, age,
gender, sexual identity, comorbidities, and geography. As such, the development and use of ethically-
congruent strategies to engage, recruit, and retain disproportionately affected populations is critical for
diabetes translation research and health equity. However, a major gap is suboptimal reach, adoption, and
sustained use of evidence-based prevention and care programs, especially among minorities and underserved
populations. Successful translation of evidence to practice, programs, and policy is a complex, lengthy process
that benefits from understanding socioecological factors, intentional community engagement, and application
of behavioral and implementation science approaches and methods. Effective translation research can
efficiently identify ways to improve reach adoption, utilization, and continued engagement with evidence-based
prevention and care programs. The Georgia Center for Diabetes Translation Research (GCDTR) proposes a
Socio-ecological and Behavioral Science for Equity Core (Core C) that will leverage the collective
strengths of previous core co-directors [Henry Akintobi, (Disparities) and Escoffery (Engagement and Behavior
Change)], a multi-disciplinary group of Core Experts, and the intentional incorporation of community partners
and organizations poised to consult, guide and engage investigators. Core C leverages Emory University,
Georgia Institute of Technology, and Morehouse School of Medicine's impressive history of collaboration and
longstanding work in translation research. Core C will provide expanded support and guidance towards the use
of community-engaged translation research and behavior change models to address multilevel determinants of
health (Aim 1), provide methodological expertise and education on mixed method data analytic strategies (Aim
2), and apply community-engaged methods to facilitate the application of innovative digital technologies in
diabetes prevention and management implementation research (Aim 3; collaboration with Regional Core).
Core C will also partner with other GCDTR Cores and Programs to implement a coordinated, innovative
“multidisciplinary team approach” to support the GCDTR's Pilot and Feasibility and Enrichment Programs,
mentor early career and underrepresented minority investigators, and to promote translation research and
equity."
10917208,"REGIONAL CORE: PROGRAM SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Disparities in diabetes prevention and care are pronounced in the Southeast, and there is an unmet need for
translation research that evaluates and advances the role of technology in both providing continuity of care and
minimizing healthcare inequities. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted how the accelerated use of
technologies (e.g., expansion of telehealth) has helped healthcare systems accommodate patient and provider
needs while minimizing viral exposure risk. Numerous barriers have been identified that may hinder the
implementation of such technologies in communities and clinical practices, and little is known about the impact
that this technological revolution in healthcare will have on vulnerable populations. In addition to telehealth,
other technological advances include multiple interfaces and interoperability that allow for remote monitoring
and population health management. However, access to this type of technology in disadvantaged populations
is often low. At the same time, smartphone ownership has grown rapidly in the US (~80%), including among
those with lower incomes, and people are turning to the internet for advice, coaching, connection, and health
care like never before. It is also important to consider the way technologies are implemented in certain
populations, given that continued rapid technological advances and overwhelming marketing can sometimes
widen the technology gap and increase disparities. Additionally, poor implementation can lead to early
discontinuation of technology use that might have been beneficial long term. As such, the Regional Core
(Technologies Advancing Translation and Equity) of the Georgia Center for Diabetes Translation Research
(GCDTR) will combine, a priori, technologies with implementation science to optimize the reach, adoption,
impact, and sustainability of technologies for diabetes and disparities reduction. The Core will achieve its goal
by: a) establishing a Collaborative Learning Network across Georgia, Florida, and Tennessee to enhance
knowledge sharing activities focused on technological approaches in diabetes prevention and care (Aim 1); b)
providing expertise and consulting in five key technological diversity driven approaches; interactive
technologies; wearables; artificial intelligence and Big Data; and electronic health records integration and
clinical decision support with specific guidance on reducing disparities and promoting equity (Aim 2); and c)
funding projects that inform how to optimize the reach, adoption, implementation, effectiveness, and
maintenance of technologies to improve and reduce inequities in diabetes prevention and care (Aim 3). In
close collaboration with the GCDTR's Pilot and Feasibility and Enrichment Programs and other Cores, the
Regional Core will advance the availability, accessibility, and usability of key technologies that promote
equitable and cost-effective diabetes prevention and management across partner institutions in the region. The
Regional Core will also share its expertise and material with the wider CDTR network nationally."
10917212,"P&F PROGRAM: PROGRAM SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The Pilot and Feasibility (P&F) Program of the Georgia Center for Diabetes Translation Research (GCDTR)
serves a pivotal role in catalyzing high-return investments by developing junior and underrepresented minority
investigators, attracting transitioning investigators, and significantly adding to the breadth and depth of NIH-
funded collaborative interdisciplinary diabetes translation research in the Southeastern U.S.. The P&F Program
supports high impact studies to promote health equity for diverse populations with disproportionately high
diabetes burdens. The P&F Program is a center-wide activity (situated in Core A) designed to support
investigators in conducting studies that address the priority focal areas of GCDTR's Translation Research
Cores: Design and Evaluation for Equity (Core B), Socio-ecological and Behavioral Science for Equity (Core
C), and engage Technologies Advancing Translation and Equity (Regional Core) to extend GCDTR's reach to
neighboring institutions in Florida and Tennessee. The GCDTR aims to promote equity by reducing
race/ethnic, gender, age, socioeconomic, co-morbidity, and geographical disparities in our membership and
our research. The integration of the P&F Program with GCDTR's Cores and Enrichment Program ensures
that pilot study investigators will be supported by nationally-recognized Core Experts in conducting innovative
studies using state-of-the-art technologies and engagement methodologies, innovative designs, and multi-
disciplinary evaluation approaches. In grant years 1-4, the P&F Program funded 18 grants which have led to
13 federally-funded awards yielding a $23 return on every dollar granted. The P&F Program's main roles are
to: serve as a funding catalyst (Aim 1); support high-quality health equity research through linking aspiring
applicants with GCDTR's Core Experts (Aim 2); and grow the community of diverse and multidisciplinary
investigators by enhancing the productivity, visibility, and impact of pilot studies/investigators through research
career and dissemination skills training (Aim 3). These aims will be accomplished through innovations such as:
matched resource commitments (totaling $857,500 over 5 years) from GCDTR institutions to co-support pilot
studies; a Micro Grants program; a multi-disciplinary, multi-institutional review group to oversee P&F award
selection; co-hosting skills development modules with the Enrichment Program for aspiring investigators; new
processes to link P&F applicants with Core Experts prior to submitting their applications; an innovative mentee-
to-mentor program that involves guiding pilot grant awardees to transition to mentoring others; and efficiently
leveraging other NIH-funded programs. Based on GCDTR's broad research base, impactful science and pilot
outcomes to date, and rich history of engagement with communities, clinical centers, and local and federal
health agencies in the region, P&F investigators have access to some of the finest mentors in diabetes
translation research, understudied vulnerable populations, and underused but robust datasets."

The Georgia Center for Diabetes Translation Research (GCDTR) Enrichment Program serves a critical role,
facilitating a culture of diabetes translation research and promoting cohesion and collaboration across center
collaborating institutions (Emory University, Morehouse School of Medicine, Georgia Institute of Technology),
community and institutional partners in Atlanta, Georgia and the Southeastern region (specifically, Florida and
Tennessee). The Enrichment Program will orchestrate a broad range of educational and dissemination activities
and serve as a focal point for interaction and collaboration among GCDTR Core Experts and members of all
affiliations (local, state, and regional partner institutions). The Enrichment Program will be closely integrated with
the Pilot and Feasibility (P&F) Program and the GCDTR Cores (Core B: Design and Evaluation for Equity; Core
C: Socioecological and Behavioral Sciences for Equity; and the Regional Core: Technologies Advancing
Translation and Equity). The Enrichment Program will plan programming and mentoring opportunities that
coordinate with, bolster, and align with Core and P&F aims, providing a channel to share opportunities, link
collaborators, and develop skills, especially for junior and underrepresented minority (URM) investigators. The
Enrichment Program will invite diverse academic leaders across GCDTR institutions to contribute to educational
programs to keep researchers abreast of the latest developments in the field of diabetes translation research
(relevant to the Cores) and create a network to facilitate cross-disciplinary collaborative projects for junior
investigators. The program will leverage the GCDTR's extensive networks to invite visiting lectures from national
and international leaders in the field. The Enrichment Program's specific aims are to 1) create an educational and
academic environment to support innovative type 2 translation research, linked to the Cores, at our Atlanta-based
and regional partner institutions; 2) disseminate the latest knowledge in diabetes translation research and build
stronger statewide, regional, and academic-community partnerships; 3) support the expansion of junior and URM
faculty working and thriving in the field of diabetes translation research trough the formation of small, mentor-
guided, peer working groups; and 4) regularly evaluate and update programming to meet the needs of users.
Enrichment Program innovations include expanding access to programming to regional, community, and other
partners; an Enrichment Planning Committee made up of primarily junior researchers; a formal peer mentoring
program for junior researchers; and targeted efforts to promote diversity and equity in program offerings, faculty
development, and diabetes translation research. Dr. Guillermo Umpierrez (Emory School of Medicine) and Dr.
Mary Beth Weber (Emory Rollins School of Public Health) will direct the Enrichment Program, coordinating with

outstanding multi-disciplinary team of experienced clinical researchers and educators."
10892954,"Project Summary: Data Science Core
The main purposes of the Data Science Resource Core are to collect, manage and distribute
experimental data, to visualize the analyzed results such as structure and activity, and to
provide an interface for users to use our designed methods on both imaging data and omics
data. This digital infrastructure will be implemented in the form of a multi-tier services-oriented
architecture. The products of the other Research Projects will be collected via protocols that are
amenable to a digital representation. These will then be unified via spatial registration in a
common coordinate system. Ensuring that the data have appropriate landmarks and that
measurements of the spatial extent of key images is a core operation for this endeavor. With
data whose content is appropriate for unification, it will subsequently be determined which digital
format representation is most suitable for each data type, with the goal of making them easy to
present in an online interface for the consumption of the broader scientific community. Data files
with the appropriate format will be made available on the public internet. From here, a user-
friendly web-based interface will be designed and implemented on top of a platform for
astrocytic data visualization, that itself reuses best-in-class open-source visualization software
for the web. The interface will ensure that users can easily navigate between individual data
sets and also can visualize relationships between data sets across the domains from the other
Research Projects. The interface will enable the user to explore imaging data of astrocytes
collected at different positions of the brain, as well as the omics expression pattern at the
corresponding area. The interface will also provide the visualization of the astrocyte network. To
encourage broad sharing of the data resources produced, high quality metadata will be created
to include with the data that conveys its provenance. Data products will be enabled to have their
own digital object identifiers (DOIs), incorporate compatibility with ORCID ids, and embed
RRIDs into the system as necessary. Core data products will further be shared through key
federally supported data sharing resources and by applying best practices to data format and
dissemination techniques used. The data analysis method will also be made available for users
as web-based computational services for users to analyze their own data."
10892957,"Project Summary: Project 1 - Integrating Astrocytes into Models of Neural Circuits Regulating Behavior
Astrocytes, the most abundant cells in the brain, express various receptors of neurotransmitters and
neuromodulators and extend thousands of fine cellular leaflets, wrapping around the pre- and postsynaptic
neuronal elements. Studies over past decades have portrayed a picture where astrocytes actively respond to
both local and long projecting neuronal activities, first increasing cytosolic calcium ions (Ca2+) or other internal
signals, then influencing the concentration of extracellular factors and ions and ultimately modifying its gene
expression pattern and morphology. Thus, while neurons are unarguably a necessary player in neural circuits,
astrocytes need to be accounted and integrated into the neural circuits to achieve a more complete
understanding on how the brain works or dysfunctions. Indeed, it is appealing to consider astrocytes and
neurons as a unified circuit, since they participate in the brain information processing in complementary
manners in terms of both temporal and spatial domains. However, precisely how astrocytes temporally
and spatially integrate the molecular signals from diverse neuronal signals, particularly during behavior,
remains poorly understood. Likewise, how the diversity of astrocyte activity, in turn, influences neural circuit
function on various timescales, is unclear. The hypothesis is that a deeper and more complete understanding
on the astrocytes’ contribution to neural circuits can be achieved by systematically measuring,
manipulating, quantifying and modeling the astrocytes’ functional and structural status in the context of
controllable and quantifiable behavior tasks, which is the collective effort proposed by this U19 team.
Leveraging the improved and comprehensive measurement and manipulation of (a) various
neurotransmitters and neuromodulators, (b) multi-scale and multi-level anatomical information, (c)
important intracellular messengers, and (d) genomic signals from the efforts in the other three projects, this
project focuses on building mathematical models (Aim 1) to quantitatively interpret and predict how astrocytes
integrate various neuronal signals, and how the astrocytes regulate the neural circuit in both fast-time and
long-term scales. Considering that astrocytes have complex spatiotemporal dynamics and their morphologies
are irregular and in close contact with diverse neurons, one needs to accurately quantify the astrocyte
dynamics (Aim 2) and faithfully reconstruct the anatomy (Aim 3), to provide the necessary quantitative
description of observations and the fundamental geometric constraints to the model development.
Reciprocally, this project will identify knowledge gaps to suggest new experiments, make predictions to
generate new hypothesis and provide quantification tools to facilitate scientific discoveries for the other three
projects and more broadly for the neuroscience community."
10892962,"Project Summary: Project 2 - Linking Fast Timescale Neuron-Astrocyte Communication to Neural
Circuit Function and Behavior
A fundamental yet unresolved question in neuroscience is how non-neuronal cells communicate with the
surrounding neurons, influence their function, and potentially affect animal behavior. Astrocytes are in a unique
position to modulate neural circuit function. They are ubiquitous in all CNS regions, express receptors for
neurotransmitters, neuromodulators, and neuropeptides, extend highly ramified processes that interact with
synapses and other CNS elements, and can operate as a syncytium partly due to their gap junctional coupling.
These structural and functional properties enable them to modulate synaptic plasticity and neuronal excitability.
Indeed, experimental evidence from multiple species and CNS regions now suggests that astrocytes modulate
neural circuit function and behavior on both slow and fast timescales. Nevertheless, precisely how astrocytes
respond to the composite molecular signals in their environment and how their intricate excitation patterns
influence neural circuit function on fast timescales (sub-seconds to minutes) remains unclear. This Project will
test the hypothesis that the heterogeneity of astrocyte transients can be understood by the temporal integration
of the time-varying molecular signals in their environment. Previous studies have also suggested that astrocytes
operate in at least two different modes: 1) Individually, and 2) as a syncytium. Yet, the relevance of these various
forms of chemical excitation for neural circuit function remains a mystery. This Project's second hypothesis is
that the different activity modes serve distinct physiological roles, enabling astrocytes to influence neural circuits
and behavior on different timescales. This Project proposes four major Aims to tackle these issues as part of a
team initiative. Aim 1 will determine how molecular signaling by local neurons relates to astrocyte excitation. Aim
2 focuses on elucidating how neuromodulator signaling by projection neurons influences astrocyte activity. Aim
3 will determine how targeted manipulation of astrocyte function (e.g., their ability to detect, temporally integrate,
communicate, or respond to extracellular signals) modulates their excitation patterns, neural circuit function, and
behavior. Aim 4 will generate a multilayer, multilevel atlas of the investigated neuron-astrocyte circuits. These
data will be acquired from a common set of mouse cortical regions involved in sensorimotor processing using a
reward-based quantitative behavioral assay. Computational analyses and modeling of this data will be used to
identify variables controlling astrocyte excitation, cell-intrinsic parameters constraining this activity, distinct
activity modes, and neuronal properties affected by these astrocytic features. Together, the functional and
anatomical studies of this Project will a) provide foundational information about how astrocytes (individually or
as a syncytium) respond to, integrate, and modulate neural circuit function (Projects 1 and 2); b) guide the
development of novel genetically encoded indicators and interventional tools to interrogate neuron-astrocyte
circuits in vivo (Projects 2, 3, and 4); c) inform, test, and refine predictive neuron-astrocyte circuit models of
sensorimotor processing (Projects 1, 2, and Data Science Resource Core)."
10892968,"Project Summary: Project 3- Linking Neuron-Astrocyte Communication to Long-Term
Changes in Neural Circuit Function and Behavior
Astrocytes, which are often dubbed as the passive support cells, in fact closely associate with a vast number
of neuronal synapses and sense their activity, making them ideal cellular detectors and integrators of
synaptic transmission. Moreover, astrocytes remodel synaptic circuitry and function by instructing synapse
formation and plasticity. However, whether and how astrocytes play an instructive role to mediate
complex behaviors remains unknown.
The overarching hypothesis to be tested in this collaborative project is that astrocytes act as temporal
integrators, which detect and integrate local synaptic activity and long-projecting neuromodulatory
transmissions. In this subproject (Project 3), the specific hypothesis to be tested is that signal
integration property of individual or syncytia of astrocytes allows them to become entrained by
experience-driven synaptic activity during acquisition of goal-directed behaviors. These entrained astrocytes
become “engaged” with the learned behavior by epigenetic remodeling of astrocytic chromatin, leading to
long-term changes in astrocytic gene expression, structure and function (Aim1). This engagement
allows the astrocytes to rewire the local synaptic circuitry in two ways; 1) by changing the numbers of
excitatory and/or inhibitory synapses within their domains, thus modulate the local excitation/inhibition
balance, and 2) by altering their synapse association and neuropil infiltration, thus controlling
extracellular concentrations of neurotransmitters. Preliminary findings suggest that astrocyte-
mediated synaptic remodeling is not necessary for learning, but rather for the adaptability of the
learned behaviors. These findings point out a specific role for these proposed behaviorally-engaged
astrocytes in rewiring of the underlying circuits to prepare these circuits for a future eventuality, in
which the learned behavior is no longer effective -e.g. the effort to achieve the desired outcome exceeds
the value of the reward (Aim2). These behaviorally-engaged astrocytes form ensembles with their
neuronal counter parts, both of which can be identified by immediate early gene expression. During the
performance of behaviors, these astrocyte-neuron ensembles are primed to sense the changes in action/
outcome contingency so that they can instruct to stop the learned behaviors (Aim3).
Working in concert with other teams, these hypotheses will be tested in three aims, and a mechanistic blueprint
for astrocyte-neuron communication in the awake behaving mouse brain will be generated. Therefore,
these proposed studies are poised to reveal how astrocytes respond to, integrate, and modulate
neuronal connectivity in long-time scales. Furthermore, in conjunction with other teams, these findings
will guide the development of novel genetically encoded indicators and viral tools to interrogate neuron-
glia circuits in vivo (Projects 2 and 4) and inform, test, and refine predictions for neuron-
astrocyte signaling mechanisms underlying sensorimotor processing (Project 1)."
10892974,"Project Summary: Project 4 - Novel Genetically Encoded Indicators for Interrogating Neuron-Astrocyte
Communication Across Timescales
Astrocytes, the most abundant cell type in the brain, have long thought to be primarily passive support cells.
Considerable evidence from the labs has shown that astrocyte-synapse displays a dynamic and bi-directional
relationship, with local synaptic transmission and neuromodulation being capable of shaping astrocytic activity
and PAP structural plasticity, and astrocyte shaping synapse formation and modulating plasticity and signaling
via secreted factors and adhesion molecules. These critical advances in understanding astrocyte biology in
vivo are primarily due to recent applications of modern techniques initially designed for studying neurons to
direct manipulation and interrogation of astrocytes. Though the concept of astrocytes as integral and
modulatory components of neural circuit is emerging, a mechanistic understanding of causative and correlative
roles of astrocytes in operating neural circuit and contribution to the complex behaviors is still lacking, which
necessities and drives the development of improved tools. Thus, a large-scale protein engineering effort to
develop an improved tool to address unsolved questions to achieve a mechanistic understanding of causal and
correlative roles of astrocyte in neuronal circuit function and contributions to behavior is being proposed.
Provided items include:
 1. a set of optimized red-shifted glutamate, GABA, DA, and NE sensors,
 2. a set of green and red-shifted synaptic glutamate/GABA sensors to probe neuron-astrocyte connectivity
 and extracellular NT transients at tripartite synapses, and
 3. interrogate cross-talk between PKA and calcium in astrocytes and optimized green and red-shifted
 kinases sensors for in vivo applications.
These new sensors will be applied to study 1) how experience-dependent changes that drive complex patterns
of neurotransmitter or neuromodulatory signaling lead to the changes in astrocytic activity and 2) how
astrocytes modulate synaptic activity via structural plasticity across various temporal scales. The contribution is
significant because these improved tools will permit new hypotheses being tested in astrocyte biology. This
toolset will provide needed tools to facilitate experiments proposed here and provide a rich resource to the field
to bring full swing the investigation of astrocyte-neuron interaction underlying complex behavioral and cognitive
processes that are inaccessible via currently existing approaches."

In the US, 1.5 million people are affected by sepsis with a mortality of more than 250,000 annually.
Each year over 35,000 Veterans are hospitalized with sepsis, and high rates of post-sepsis
mortality and significant increases in healthcare facility use are reported among Veterans
surviving sepsis. We propose a bioenergetic approach to develop a novel treatment strategy for
sepsis. The transcription factor BTB and CNC homology 1 (BACH1) is a repressor of NRF2
function and has been shown to negatively regulate NRF2 binding to ARE sequences. Our recent
studies show that, Bach1 deletion improves organ function and survival following polymicrobial
sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) with a concomitantly increased liver HO-1
expression. In this proposal, we will determine whether HO-1 is the mediator for the salutary effect
seen in Bach1-/- mice, whether there are other critical genes regulated by BACH1 independent of
NRF2, and whether transient modulation of BACH1 can improve organ function and survival in
sepsis. The proposed research is relevant to that part of VA’s mission that pertains to better
understand the causes of and develop or improve treatments for injuries and illnesses that afflict
Veterans. The outcome of this research will be significant because the fundamental knowledge

 Individuals with intellectual disabilities (ID) commonly experience high levels of
stress due to factors like social exclusion, bullying, limited support networks, and
discrimination. Because of this they are at risk for mental health difficulties like
depression, anxiety, and severe behavior problems. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy
(MBCT) is increasingly being used for stress management for the general public and has
been successfully adapted to meet the unique learning needs of individuals with I.D.
However, there is a definite lack of home-based online mindfulness interventions
tailored to the unique learning needs of this population.
 The central goal of this project is to create an online, interactive mindfulness-
based stress reduction program: Stress, Mindfulness, and People with Intellectual
Disabilities (SM-ID). We propose three Specific Aims with the primary aim of evaluating
the feasibility of the program by examining 30 used dyads (person with ID and a support
person) with an emphasis on program satisfaction and acceptability. One secondary aim
is to conduct formative research with key stakeholders (two focus groups) to aid in
identifying appropriate content and barriers to implementation. The other secondary
aim is to assess usability of the online program with 5 dyads. This work is significant
because it will provide resources for an underserved population – individuals with ID --
who experience frequent stress with the challenges of community living and who may
lack healthy coping capacities. Moreover, the proposed program has the potential to
broadly impact the way supports are delivered to individuals with ID by adding an
integrated, efficacious intervention that overcomes common barriers to individuals with
ID’s participation (time, finances, and availability). From a public health perspective,
this approach is ideally structured to meet the needs of this population of people with ID
who are in need of easy to implement and cost-effective support and training.
 Upon completion in Phase II, individuals with ID and their support person will
have access to a complete SM-ID program, designed to help them cope with stress more
effectively and strengthen their healthy coping skills. The program will provide
individuals with ID with engaging, interactive content, including: tools for monitoring
progress, text prompts to motivate behavior change, guidance in setting effective value-
based goals, strategies for reducing stress, and training in mindfulness-based coping
skills. The SM-ID program will be available on a mobile website that can be accessed by
smart phones, tablets and computers and will provide realistic situational videos
vignettes, and workbook exercises to help individuals with ID deal effectively with stress.
In Phase I of this project, we will determine the feasibility of the program by examining
primary and secondary outcomes related to a prototype of the SM-ID program."
10832641,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Americans aged ≥65 years accounted for 57% and 75% of all influenza-related hospitalizations and deaths,
respectively, in the 2019-20 season, despite a vaccination rate of ~68%. Flu vaccine effectiveness is lower in
the elderly than in younger adults, requiring either a high-dose (Fluzone® HD) or an adjuvanted (FluAd®) vaccine.
Antigen mismatch in vaccine vs. circulating strains results in insufficient protection, and poor responses in the
elderly remain major public health concerns. Cell-mediated immunity may correlate better than humoral
immunity for vaccine protection in the elderly. Adjuvants used to enhance vaccine efficacy, such as MPLA, CpG
and alum, trigger either innate or antibody responses, but not a T cell response. While existing adjuvants or
increased antigen load may partially improve seroconversion, overall vaccine effectiveness and T cell responses
may be suboptimal in at-risk populations. New adjuvants are needed that induce robust T cell responses for
pathogen clearance. A key factor for suboptimal vaccine effectiveness in the elderly is immunosenescence, a
gradual age-related immune decline. Prolonged cell adhesion mediated by integrins α4β1 and αLβ2 and their
cognate ligands, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, is essential for effective antigen presentation and T cell priming at the
immune synapse between antigen presenting cells (APCs) and naïve T cells, as well as for T cell memory and
effector functions. Deficient APC-T cell adhesion attenuates T cell activation and memory. Age-related defects
in ICAM-1 induction on activated dendritic cells may decrease T cell priming, resulting in suboptimal vaccine
effectiveness in the elderly. 7HP349 is a first-in-concept, oral, small-molecule, allosteric α4β1/αLβ2 activator that
may promote APC-T cell adhesion, and improve T helper function and the effectiveness of geriatric influenza
vaccination. In mice, 7HP349 significantly improved the effectiveness of influenza, Chagas disease, SARS-CoV-
2 and tuberculosis vaccines, not only via humoral responses but also cell-mediated immunity, which differentiates
it from current or emerging competition. A first-in-human Phase I clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability
and PK of 7HP349 in healthy male subjects was completed in 4Q 2021. 7HP349 was shown to be safe and orally
bioavailable, with no treatment-related serious adverse events. Additionally, the optimal pharmacokinetic dose
was identified. In this application, we propose to evaluate 7HP349 as an oral adjuvant to influenza vaccination
in aging mice with pre-existing immunity, that would be representative of vaccination in the elderly. Additionally,
to activate a supplemental IND for geriatric influenza, we plan to complete additional required Chemistry,
Manufacturing and Control activities that will include development of a 100 mg strength to enable once daily,
one pill dosing to improve patient compliance, and manufacture of cGMP 7HP349 Drug Product to support the
IND and build inventory for a future Phase I/IIa clinical study in elderly subjects to assess the safety of 7HP349
and to evaluate its immunogenicity in combination with Fluzone® HD, which will also lay the foundation for its

 In our parent R 01 application, we have shown that the presence of dopants in HA influences the bone
remodeling process and phase stability in coating while improving coating interfacial mechanical properties
processed via laser and plasma. Specific dopants like magnesium (Mg), zinc (Zn), and silicon (Si) in their oxide
form help in osteogenesis and angiogenesis. However, those dopants have limited influence on
osteoinductivity or osteoclastogenesis, and both are needed to minimize aseptic loosening. The objective of
this follow-up application is to understand osteogenesis mechanisms via in vitro gene expressions and in vivo
studies using rat and rabbit distal femur models of doped HA-coated implants with plant-derived compounds
(PDCs) such as gingerol from ginger, allicin from garlic, and carvacrol from oregano. It is envisioned that PDCs
will be responsible for osteoinduction and reduced osteoclastogenesis to improve bone tissue-material
interactions, minimize aseptic loosening and implant migration. Over 1 million total joint arthroplasties have
been performed in 2019 in the United States alone. Aseptic loosening is still considered one of the most
common failure modes in these surgeries' coming days. Metal implants such as Ti6Al4V are widely used for
arthroplasties due to their excellent biocompatibility in vivo. Although Ti6Al4V is osteoconductive, cementless
implants for joint replacement depend on stringent initial mechanical stability for bone ingrowth/apposition to
occur. Initial implant integration and avoidance of late aseptic loosening are even more challenging in the
revision scenario, in which the bone-bed is often sclerotic and dysvascular. We hypothesize that: 1) addition of
PDCs with selected dopants in HA coating will modulate release kinetics and control bone remodeling in vivo;
2) PDCs will locally increase bone density and introduce osteoinductivity, especially for patients with
compromised bone in revision surgeries; and 3) an easily introduced oxide layer between the metal substrate
and HA coating will maintain stronger bonding between the metal implant and the ceramic coating. Our design
goals are: 1) improve bioactivity and introduce osteoinductivity to minimize healing time and 2) enhance
interfacial mechanical properties between the HA coating and the implant to increase coating in vivo lifetime.
We propose the following two specific aims: (1) Aim 1: Understanding of gene expressions for PDC added
doped HA coatings on Ti6Al4V; (2) Aim 2: Evaluate effects of PDC release from doped HA-coated Ti6Al4V on
early-stage bone cell – materials interactions and in vivo biological response. The following outcome measures
will judge this project's success: quantitative and qualitative control of PDC added doped HA coatings on
Ti6Al4V in terms of enhanced osteoinductivity, uniformity in microstructure leading to higher interfacial
mechanical strength, improved cellular differentiation, and bone-tissue integration. This program's scientific
understanding will improve the long-term fixation of cementless implants and minimize aseptic loosening."
10795057,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
 This K01 application to NIMH will enable a concentrated four-year intensive training and mentored
research program designed to transition Dr. Sarah Peitzmeier from her current observational research focus to
a new research agenda designing and evaluating structural interventions within a community-based
participatory research (CBPR) context for integrated HIV and violence prevention and mental health promotion,
in partnership with trans women of color. Dr. Peitzmeier is an assistant professor at the University of Michigan
School of Nursing and School of Public Health, which houses one of the oldest CBPR partnerships and
academies nationally (the Detroit Urban Research Center) and is a powerhouse of HIV intervention research.
 Racism, sexism, HIV stigma, cisgenderism, and other interlocking forms of oppression generate
mutually reinforcing structural vulnerabilities for trans women of color, including gender-based violence (GBV),
poverty, homelessness, and sex work. These structural vulnerabilities synergistically interact to elevate risk of
HIV. However, interventions to address these deeply entrenched upstream structural determinants of HIV in
this population are limited, which in turn limits the efficacy of downstream individual behavioral interventions
while these determinants remain intact. The proposed work will 1) Identify community priorities for a structural
intervention for integrated HIV/GBV prevention through forming a CBPR partnership with trans women of color
and service providers in Detroit and conducting an Action-Oriented Community Diagnosis, 2) Develop a
grounded theory of how trans women's participation in a cash-plus cash transfer intervention affects their
experience of GBV, HIV-related behaviors, and mental health, and 3) Collaboratively design a status-neutral
intervention to promote HIV prevention and care, reduce mental health burden, and prevent GBV against trans
women of color.
 The research will be underpinned by coursework in CBPR, structural interventions, intervention trial
design, and implementation science, as well as invaluable mentored learning experiences observing the
implementation and evaluation of diverse structural interventions (Drs. Darbes, Sherman, Gamarel, and
Pettifor) and CBPR partnerships (Gamarel, Israel, Brush, Rivera) from renowned experts in the field. Overall,
the research will generate rich preliminary data, a finalized intervention protocol, a concrete strategy for
funding and implementing the intervention, a pilot hybrid efficacy-implementation trial design for evaluating the
intervention, and a strong CBPR partnership as a fruitful platform for Dr. Peitzmeier's ongoing research agenda
in partnership with this community. By supporting didactic and field-based learning and protected time for
research and CBPR partnership building, a K01 will advance Dr. Peitzmeier's career progression as an
independent, community-based HIV intervention scientist focused on structural determinants of health, leading
to better health and wellbeing among trans women of color, an NIH priority population."

10904834,"Summary
To ensure a successful and sustained response to the COVID-19 crisis it becomes imperative that the
functional implications of the considerable genotypic and phenotypic variation in natural human immunity are
understood. Natural killer (NK) cells have major roles in controlling the innate and adaptive immune response
to viral infections, including herpesviruses, HIV-1, influenza, and SARS. NK cells comprise a significant part of
the front-line defense against pathogen invasions and are present at large numbers in lung tissues. NK cell
effector functions, including cytokine release and cytotoxicity, are modulated by interactions of killer cell
immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) with class I human leukocyte antigens (HLA) expressed on tissue cells.
Across individuals, there is enormous diversity in the number and nature of viable receptor and ligand pairs
and within individuals, there is a multitude of NK cell subsets distinguished by their receptors. Previous studies
of epidemic diseases have identified clear relationships between this diversity and susceptibility, resistance or
control of infection.
Likely reflecting exposure throughout human history to multiple, diverse and geographically discrete
pathogens, the HLA and KIR genes are highly variable across individuals and population groups. These
genetic variations have direct impact on NK cell functions and the response to infection. Allotype-dependent
interactions of KIR with HLA inform, modulate and diversify NK cells in their role of identifying and eliminating
virus-infected tissue cells. Consideration of the full extent of this variation across human populations is thus
critical to understanding, diagnosing and treating SARS-CoV-2 infection, and for developing and testing
vaccines.
The overarching hypothesis that we will investigate is that genetic variation of HLA and KIR can determine the
course of immunity following SARS-CoV-2 infection, leading to severe COVID-19 in some individuals. The first
Aim of our study will examine a large multi-ethnic cohort of 11,500 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, to determine
the association of HLA and KIR genetic diversity with severity of disease. The cohorts are drawn from the
countries hardest hit by the pandemic, including Brazil, Italy, Spain, UK and the USA. NK cells recognize
infected cells through loss of ligands for inhibitory receptors or gain of ligands for activating receptors. Many
viruses are known to exploit any or all of these mechanisms to evade immune detection. The second Aim will
examine the role of SARS-CoV-2 derived proteins in evading NK cell driven immune responses, and how this
varies across all known HLA and KIR allotype interactions. NK cells can be activated by antibodies that are
bound to virus segments on the surface of infected cells, and we have shown this activity is also dependent on
HLA and KIR diversity. The final Aim will therefore examine the role of antibody-dependent elimination of
SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, and the impact of KIR and HLA polymorphism on this response. Validating our
approach, our preliminary findings already identified one potential therapeutic target. Our findings will thus
have immediate consequence for identifying individuals most at risk for developing severe COVID-19, for
developing both universal and personalized treatment, and to aid in vaccine design."
10900754,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Developing universal vaccines to influenza and HIV-1 is an urgent global goal. A critical challenge is that
immune responses to native HIV-1 envelope (Env) and influenza hemagglutinin (HA) are dominated by non-
neutralizing and highly strain-specific antibodies. Discoveries that some individuals produce broadly
neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) invigorated hope that, while not naturally dominant, broadly protective antibody
responses are possible. Antibodies mature during through somatic hypermutation (SHM) and affinity-based
selection in germinal centers (GCs) in competition with other antibodies that recognize different parts of the
same virus. It is widely believed that a prime and boost vaccine tactic can effectively elicit bnAb precursors and
strategically guide SHM trajectory can produce bnAbs. Challenges to this process are that native envelope
proteins may not bind well to the bnAb precursor antibodies and may be poorly represented in the antibody
repertoire. A strategic prime and boost strategy requires generation of designer viral envelope variants that
bind well to bnAb ancestor antibodies acting as a primer, followed by modified variants to function as boosting
immunogen(s) to shepherd bnAb maturation. This promising approach is hindered by time and effort required
to identify Env or HA variants as immunogens, which traditionally require mutation library generation, in vitro
static selection, cloning, expression, and validation testing. This extensive hands-on trial and error process
greatly hinders the pace of progress. Here a new technology is proposed with power to explosively accelerate
the pace of immunogen discovery by creatively harnessing the full spectrum of automated mutation and
selection inherent in one of nature’s innovations in hyperevolution—namely the GC SHM and affinity
maturation system—an automated in vivo dynamic mutation process coupled to parallel selection activity that
dynamically shuttles superior binding variants back for further diversification and selection. In addition to
dramatically improving binding affinity, the GC system can be engineered to generate new recognition. The
objective is to create flipped GC systems in which antibody genes are replaced with viral envelope proteins—
and deploy them for immunogen design. In contrast to dynamic antibody evolution to viral envelop protein in
normal GCs, flipped GCs dynamically evolve viral envelop protein toward user-defined antibodies (e.g. select
bnAb precursors and intermediates). The overall hypothesis is that, in the context of key modifications, the
GC/affinity maturation system is sufficiently flexible to permit bioengineered viral envelope proteins to affinity
mature toward user-defined bnAb precursors and intermediates. The objective will be pursued with two aims:
1) to establish parameters to engineer GCs as a platform for non-Ig protein evolution. And 2) to generate HIV-1
and influenza envelop variants from flipped GC mice. Completion of this work has potential to result in both
scientific and technological breakthroughs of broad impact because it is expected to define parameters
enabling the extension of the power of GC evolution beyond Ig to essentially any protein-protein interaction."
10903944,"Abstract
Cell division orientation must be tightly controlled for the generation of normal tissue architecture and cell
fates. In the skin, oriented cell divisions promote the stratification of the embryonic epidermis and
morphogenesis of hair follicles. In adults, spindle orientation buffers the epidermis against oncogenic insults
and tissue overgrowth. Given these important functions, it is paramount to understand the mechanisms by
which mitotic spindles are precisely oriented. While some of the proteins required for spindle orientation have
been identified, we do not fully understand how this molecular machinery generates forces on astral
microtubules to allow accurate control of cell division orientation. Our preliminary studies have identified novel
regulators of epidermal spindle orientation. Here we propose studies to undercover the underlying
mechanisms by which these proteins affect division orientation. Further, we will use novel mouse models to
define how spindle orientation contributes to hair follicle morphogenesis and adult epidermal homeostasis.
Together, these data will provide a deeper mechanistic understanding of spindle orientation which has
essential functions in epidermal, cardiac and neural development as well as the adaptive immune response.
In addition, this work has direct relevance for understanding how spindle orientation controls cell fates in hair
development, and how it acts to suppress tissue overgrowth when homeostasis is perturbed."

 Obesity is one of the most important public health issues today, contributing to many of the leading causes
of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Despite strong desires to achieve long-term weight loss goals,
individuals with obesity tend to overvalue immediate rewards and discount the future. Episodic Future Thinking
(EFT), a cognitive strategy in which individuals envision themselves in the future and simulate potential
experiences, has been shown to help shift attention to the future, improve food choices, and reduce intake.
Most previous studies have used promotion-focused EFT, in which participants envision themselves
experiencing positive future outcomes. However, theories suggest it is possible EFT-based strategies may be
alternatively focused on prevention, guiding participants to consider future consequences of unhealthy choices.
 Our recent pilot (R03 DK106405) randomized controlled trial implemented these approaches in a 3-month
Internet-delivered behavioral weight loss program (iBWL). Participants (n=95) were randomized to either: (1)
Standard iBWL (no EFT-based strategies), (2) PREVENT (iBWL + EFT-based strategies focused on
preventing long-term negative consequences of unhealthy choices), or (3) PROMOTE (iBWL + EFT-based
strategies focused on promoting long-term benefits of healthy choices). PREVENT was superior to standard
iBWL producing the greatest overall weight loss, which was coupled with reduced food reward drive and
increased self-control. This is consistent with our previous work in which use of the PREVENT strategy was
associated with reduced craving and increased inhibitory control neural activity. Although PREVENT produced
the greatest weight loss, variability suggests individual differences may moderate success in each treatment.
For instance, individuals high in promotion-focus were more likely to have greater weight loss in PROMOTE.
 We now propose a fully powered randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test if either of these novel
approaches may provide benefit over standard treatment. Further, the proposed study will seek to identify
moderators that predict success, determining for whom each strategy is best. Individuals with
overweight/obesity (n=360) will be randomized to 12 months of either (1) Standard iBWL, (2) PREVENT, or (3)
PROMOTE. All participants will have an introductory training session, during which PREVENT and PROMOTE
groups will receive training in their specific EFT-based strategy. iBWL lessons will then be weekly for 3 months
followed by a ‘refresher’ training session for all groups, and monthly iBWL for the remaining 9 months. In
PREVENT and PROMOTE iBWL lessons and feedback messages will continuously feature exercises and
reminders to utilize the assigned EFT-based strategies. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, during
treatment at 3 and 6 months, at the end of treatment (12 months), and 6 months post-treatment (18 months).
The primary outcome is weight change. This RCT will provide critical insight into novel treatment strategies for
improving weight loss and may lead to future optimization of weight loss via individually tailored treatment."
10902095,"Project Summary
 Obesity is a common condition that is associated with poor health outcomes, and a significant portion of
these pathologies are mediated by dysfunction and dysregulation of adipose tissue at a cellular and molecular
level. Adipose tissue contains a unique population of macrophages (adipose tissue macrophages, or ATMs).
These ATMs accumulate in obesity and mediate a number of key processes and pathologies in adipose tissue,
including lipid handling, inflammation, and insulin resistance. Multiple populations of ATMs exist: a tissue-
resident, anti-inflammatory population is descended from yolk sac embryonic hematopoietic progenitors and is
present at all times; a pro-inflammatory population is derived from circulating monocyte precursors in adults
and is recruited under conditions of metabolic stress such as obesity. Exosomes are small, secreted,
endosome-derived, membrane-bound extracellular vesicles. Adipocytes constitutively release lipid-containing
exosomes (adipocyte-derived exosomes, or AdExos), and the rate of their secretion is increased during states
of increased ATM accumulation, including obesity and acute fasting. AdExos can also act as macrophage
chemoattractants and drive reprogramming of bone marrow-derived macrophages toward an ATM-like
transcriptional and phenotypic identity. However, many questions regarding the full scope and effects of
AdExos remain unaddressed. We hypothesize that AdExos regulate the accumulation and differentiation of
macrophages in adipose tissue via pathways canonically known to regulate ATMs. Given that AdExo
production is increased in conditions during which monocyte recruitment and ATM recruitment occurs, and that
AdExos both act directly as macrophage chemoattractants and drive production of monocyte chemoattractant
factors in adipose tissue, we believe that AdExos regulate monocyte recruitment to adipose tissue. Aim 1
seeks to establish this role in an in vivo setting by monitoring the effect of direct AdExo injection on
chemoattraction and accumulation of monocytes. Previous work has examined the effect of AdExos on the
identity of bone marrow-derived macrophages, but not more relevant precursors such as yolk sac
hematopoietic progenitors and peripheral monocytes. Aim 2 seeks to test the relationship between progenitor
cell identity and the effect of AdExo exposure on cell fate. While we have established that AdExos may play a
role in both ATM recruitment and ATM identity, we do not know the mechanisms that govern these actions.
Aim 3 seeks to test whether pathways known to canonically regulate ATM differentiation and identity, like the
CCR2 axis and PPARG, respectively, are also responsible for the AdExo-mediated regulation of these
processes in ATMs."

ICCS2020-A1
This multi-PI project conducts experiments to study cell state instability in tumor cells, motivated by the theory of
“critical transitions” (CT). CTs are abrupt shifts of behavior of a complex non-linear system and are preceded by
system state destabilization. A cancer cell population represents a statistical ensemble of cells, each of which is
a nonlinear stochastic dynamical system. The latter is embodied by the gene regulatory network (GRN) and cells
are normally in stable attractor states. We hypothesize that cancer cells in small lesions can be poised between
either staying dormant or exiting dormancy (“escape”) and that this binary decision is a CT. This implies that to
be in such a poised state, the cell state has to be destabilized. Thus, detecting cell state instability, manifest in
the cell transcriptomes, can discern if a small tumor is safely in a stable state or poised in the above sense. Many
an observation suggests that cell density of the dormant tumor may be a “bifurcation parameter” that drives GRN
dynamics, via instability toward the CT, at which a cancer cell population can jump to the state of steady growth.
SPECIFIC AIMS. The proposed study is experimental but grounded in theory: Cell state instability is manifest in
an increase of the quantity IC that we derived from theory and requires single-cell (sc) transcriptomes in a popu-
lation to compute (=dynamics of a statistical ensemble of GRNs). Aim 1 (in vitro) uses large ensembles of micro-
cultures (=cancer cell populations) to quantitatively show destabilization and bifurcations of growth behaviors.
Aim 2 (in vivo) reevaluates old mouse tumor models in a new scheme that exposes the binary decision (dor-
mancy vs. “tumor-take”) to test the hypothesis that clinical dormancy escape is preceded by cell state instability.
APPROACH: In Aim 1, using massively-parallel micro-cultures, bulk RNASeq and scRNAseq, we examine hith-
erto undistinguished growth modes of cancer cells and measure bistability as a function of cell density (dormancy
vs. “take-off”). In Aim 2 we examine our intriguing observations in many mouse models: under specific condi-
tions, identified by titrating inoculum cell numbers in creating dormant tumors, some mice exhibit stable dor-
mancy and others a robust tumor-take despite same initial conditions. This finding suggests a poised state and
defines a bistable regime. Tumor models using cells studied in Aim 1 will be evaluated in our scheme to expose
bistable behaviors and Ic computed from scRNAseq data. We anticipate that tumors in unstable dormancy poised
to take-off display higher cell state instability (higher IC) than the stably dormant tumors. But sc-transcriptomes
will also reveal the genes that drive the CT and how they are linked to the risk of impending dormancy escape.
SIGNIFICANCE: While this first-in-its-class study analyzes abstract principles rather than specific molecules, its
potential impact is tangible: It predicts the fate trajectory of indolent tumors in a new way, complementing current
quest for molecular signatures to classify tumors by prognostic groups, by detecting in single-cell resolution cell
population data signs of destabilization that herald an approach to the CT or “tipping point” of dormancy escape.
This work also raises awareness of non-linear behaviors for the design of more relevant animal tumor models."
10900586,"ABSTRACT
Hepatic drug uptake transporters are major regulators of systemic clearance and patient outcome, however,
characterization of post-translational modifications that mediate the function of these transporters have remained
greatly under studied. Therefore, the long-term goal associated with this proposal is to define the extent and
significance of post-translational-mediated regulation of pharmacologically important drug-transporters, such as
OATP1B1. The overall objective of this proposal is to delineate the consequences of tyrosine kinase inhibitor-
(TKI) mediated inhibition of OATP1B1. The central hypothesis is that specific tyrosine kinase(s) are essential
regulators of OATPB1, and that interference with this process will decrease hepatic accumulation and increase
plasma concentrations of OATP1B1 substrates, resulting in pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD)
drug-drug interactions (DDIs). The rationale for this project is that elucidation of the regulatory mechanisms that
affect OATP1B1 function will contribute to refinement of therapeutic strategies that have unfortunately to date
yielded a variety of unexpected DDI-mediated life-threatening toxicities, which includes statin-induced
rhabdomyolysis. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Identify and elucidate
the role of regulatory kinases involved in OATP1B1 function; and 2) Investigate the in vivo effects of regulatory
kinases on OATP1B1 activity. Under the first aim, LC/MS/MS-based proteomics will be used to measure the
ability of kinase inhibitors to modulate OATP1B1 phosphorylation in vitro and ex vivo, while genetic manipulation
and comprehensive kinase inhibition or binding assays will be utilized to identify the regulatory kinase of
OATP1B1 function. Under the second aim, human transgenic OATP1B1, as well as transporter- and kinase-
deficient in vivo mouse models will be used to assess PK/PD changes of OATP1B1 substrates in the presence
or absence of TKIs. This will provide mechanistic insight into the role of tyrosine kinases in regulating OATP1B1-
mediated hepatic handling of substrates. The collective findings of Aim 2 will also be utilized to develop
physiologically-based PK/PD models to predict outcome of TKI-OATP1B1 substrate interactions. The research
proposed in this application is innovative because it represents a substantive departure from the status quo by
exploring tyrosine kinase activity as a regulator of OATP1B1 function and as a mediator of systemic levels of
both endogenous biomarkers and xenobiotics. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to
provide important new insights into regulatory mechanisms essential to the function of OATP1B1, the molecular
kinase pathways modulating this transporter, and their role in the hepatic handling of the many relevant
endogenous and xenobiotic substrates. Ultimately, such knowledge is expected to contribute to the foundation
of preventing life-threatening DDIs in patients."

A prolonged first episode of psychosis (FEP) without adequate treatment is the most consistent predictor of
poor clinical and functional outcomes 1, poor health outcomes 2 and significant economic burden 3. Team-based
“coordinated specialty care” (CSC)4 for early psychosis (EP) has established effectiveness in promoting clinical
and functional recovery 5 . EP treatment programs have expanded rapidly with increased funding across the US
without formal coordination of training or implementation. While EP programs share many features, the lack of
state and national coordination and data infrastructure limits the capacity for large-scale evaluation or
accelerated dissemination of best practices 6. Based on prior collaborations with 30 California (CA) EP
programs and experiences using mobile health (MOBI mHealth) technology to measure individual outcomes in
EP care, the UC Davis (UCD) team is uniquely poised to create EPI-CAL, a CA network that will contribute
systematically collected outcomes data on over 1000 FEP clients per year, from 6 community and 6 university
EP clinics, to a national EP network supported by the NIMH EPINET program. Building on our prior work
evaluating CA EP programs, EPI-CAL programs will participate in a formative evaluation in Year 1 to define
core EP clinical features, intervention targets, and outcomes needed to harmonize network input. A “core
battery” based on current measures collected at the sites, the PhenX toolkit 7 and expanded to cover all critical
domains, will be installed across the network in Year 2. Core client outcomes and metrics of data use for
treatment decisions will be collected using the custom MOBI mHealth data network at the client, program, and
state level to allow easy data analysis, interpretation and dissemination. Training and ongoing monitoring will
be provided at all EPI-CAL sites to ensure appropriate implementation. EPI-CAL will contribute de-identified
data to the national coordinating hub. Using the RE-AIM implementation science framework 8,9, we will
systematically evaluate the impact of MOBI on EP programs across 5 dimensions: reach, efficacy, adoption,
implementation, and maintenance (see Figure 1). To demonstrate the network’s research capacity, in the R34
component of this application, we propose to develop and validate a measure of the Duration of Untreated
Psychosis (DUP) that is feasible for use in community settings and psychometrically sound. Although DUP is a
significant predictor of both short-term CSC treatment response5 and long-term outcomes 10 for FEP, no
measure currently exists that has been rigorously validated and is feasible for use by community providers 7,11.
We will utilize stakeholder feedback (clients, family members, academic experts and CSC staff) to develop a
tool with standardized DUP definitions that includes anchored assessment of psychosis onset and start of
treatment. Developing such a tool will allow standardized assessment of this critical moderator of CSC
outcomes across the entire EPINET."

practice-based research network (PBRN) projects; and building institutional capacity to respond to prioritized
IPP health issues.
 Specific Aim 2: Facilitate the conduct of community-engaged CTR by mentoring junior investigators (JI)
and established investigators (EI) to conduct community-engaged CTR; linking JI/EI with research-ready
community partners; and developing an IPP participant registry to maximize recruitment and retention for CTR.
 Specific Aim 3: Employ community-driven strategies to disseminate and implement CTR findings by
establishing a Community Advisory Board (CAB) to coordinate CEO Core activities, review pilot projects, and
interface with the Internal and External Advisory Committees; convening an annual workshop to set strategic
goals, share best practices for community-engaged CTR and dissemination and implementation; and
implementing an active communication and dissemination plan to ensure that research findings and innovations
are shared with intended communities in a user-friendly format.
 At the end of 5 years, the CEO Core will have helped to expand and sustain CTR partnerships by facilitating
the bidirectional flow of ideas between academic and community partners to reduce health disparities and by
creating productive, supportive environments for JI/EI to collaboratively conduct CTR. Moreover, the CEO Core
will have connected communities, investigators, and other PIKO cores to ensure culturally-appropriate methods,
tools, and interventions were used to reduce health disparities in communities across Hawaii."
10911883,"The overarching goal of the Center for Pacific Innovations, Knowledge, and Opportunities (PIKO) is to
develop a robust infrastructure for clinical and translational research (CTR), intending to mitigate health
disparities in Indigenous Pacific People (IPP), defined as Native Hawaiians, Other Pacific Islanders, and
Filipinos, as well as in other underserved populations (e.g., immigrants, homeless, and sexual and gender
minorities). To achieve this goal, a Pilot Project Program (PPP) will be designed to provide funding, on a
competitive basis, to Junior Investigators (JI) and Established Investigators (EI) who are seeking to make
significant changes to their research program. They will come from the faculty of the University of Hawaii,
Hawaii Pacific University, and Chaminade University of Honolulu. Funding will be prioritized toward innovative,
high quality, and impactful T1–T5 CTR pilot projects, with an emphasis on T3-T5, that accelerate the translation
of clinical and biomedical research into better patient care and improved public health for IPP and other
underserved populations. The provision of support for pilot projects is expected to result in heightened research
productivity and increased competitiveness for mainstream extramural funding for JI/EI. Also, given the serious
concerns about the aging of the NIH-funded scientific workforce, and the dearth of IPP principal investigators,
we will actively encourage applications from IPP JI/EI. Thus, the PPP Core objective will be achieved through
the following Specific Aims:
 Specific Aim 1: Solicit, review, and fund meritorious pilot projects by developing eligibility criteria, and
managing solicitation procedures and application submission processes; and by establishing review criteria and
managing review, funding-decision, and award-approval processes.
 Specific Aim 2: Provide post-award oversight and evaluation of pilot projects by monitoring and
evaluating the performance, progress, productivity, and return on investment of the awardees; and by assuring
awardees comply with federal policies, rules, and guidelines for conducting CTR.
 By the end of five years, the PIKO PPP Core will have funded 35 to 45 JI/EI to conduct culturally responsive
and scientifically rigorous CTR pilot projects focused on improving the health of IPP and other medically
underserved and vulnerable populations. Preliminary data from these pilot projects will be used to secure
federal and national grant funding. Most of the funded JI/EI will be from IPP backgrounds, thereby increasing
the number of IPP investigators successfully competing for NIH or other extramural funding."

Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is a potentially curative therapy for a variety of neoplastic disorders.
However, the composition of the microbiota is often disturbed during the process of HCT. Alterations or dysbiosis
of the lung microbiome post-HCT are associated with poor clinical outcomes, including lung injury. Pulmonary
complications commonly occur among HCT recipients and are a leading cause of post-HCT morbidity and
mortality. These pulmonary complications include both pathologies generated by infectious agents and also the
so called “non-infectious” disorders. Non-infectious pulmonary complications are associated with irreversible
pulmonary dysfunction and considerable mortality. No cure exists for these progressive disorders such as
idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS) which is characterized by pneumonitis, lung injury and often fibrosis. The
etiology and pathogenesis of non-infectious post-HCT pulmonary disorders is poorly understood and research
in this area is a critical need within the NIH mission. Our long-term goal is to improve outcomes for HCT recipients
by developing microbiome-informed therapeutic strategies to manage post-HCT pulmonary complications.
We have shown that primary infection or reactivation of latent herpesviruses increases the risk of post-HCT lung
injury such as IPS and that these lung injuries are associated with dysbiosis of lung microbiota in human HCT
recipients. We have developed novel animal models that recapitulate the pathologic features of IPS to allow for
mechanistic studies. We have shown that a loss in abundance of Lactobacillus species and the Lachnospiraceae
family in mice is associated with developing IPS-like pneumonitis and fibrosis, and that the development of
pneumonitis and fibrosis post-HCT and herpesviral infection is IL-17-dependent. Importantly, microbiota isolated
from the lungs of HCT mice stimulate pro-IL-17 responses by lung dendritic cells (DCs) potentially through
impairing the expression of Notch ligand, delta like ligand 4 (DLL4). Thus, we hypothesize that HCT-altered
lung microbiota facilitate lung DC modifications/priming so that DCs promote pathogenic IL-17 responses to
herpes virus infection leading to lung pathology and the development of pulmonary complications like IPS. We
will pursue the following three specific aims in this proposed project.
Aim 1. Identify key lung microbiota associated with post-HCT pulmonary complications
Aim 2. Determine the mechanism(s) through which lung microbiota regulate lung DC function
Aim 3. Determine the role of Lactobacillus species and the Lachnospiraceae family in the development
of post-HCT pulmonary complications"

 This proposal is for a training program in the area of sleep and circadian research and the related
disorders. There is growing evidence of the prevalence of sleep disorders in the American population, and that
problems related to inadequate sleep have a major impact on many aspects of our society. At a basic level, little
is known about the fundamental mechanisms that control sleep and the function(s) of sleep. Thus, there is a
major opportunity for scientific discovery. One of the barriers that is recognized to advancing the knowledge base
in this area is the paucity of investigators, both those engaged in basic research and in patient-oriented research.
This application describes a training program that is based on the relatively unique faculty resources and
structures at the University of Pennsylvania for support of research in sleep and its disorders. The proposal
describes specific training aspects that are intended to complete the matrix for training opportunities at the
University of Pennsylvania (Penn) in the area of research in sleep/sleep disorders. These aspects are the
following: research training for graduate students. This is based on training provided by 3 graduate groups at
Penn. Each graduate program has a similar structure, albeit with different required coursework. The graduate
groups are: a) the Neuroscience Graduate Program. This is the Graduate Group that has been involved in this
program since its inception. We will utilize, where appropriate, structures, courses and other resources
developed by this group; b) a graduate track in genomics/computational biology; c) graduate group in cell and
molecular biology that offers our graduate students training in areas such as metabolism, genetics, and
epigenetics; d) a targeted MD/PhD program to train physician-scientists in sleep/circadian research. This aspect
of our program will be based on the outstanding institutional MD/PhD program at the University of Pennsylvania.
We also have a postdoctoral training program for nurse investigators. This will be based on the preeminent
School of Nursing at the University of Pennsylvania. The strong, well-established collaboration between the
School of Medicine and the School of Nursing in this area provides a unique opportunity to develop a much
needed national program to train nurse investigators in this area. All of these components of the program will
utilize the extensive resources for research in sleep/circadian that have been developed at the University of
Pennsylvania."
10892045,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
People with serious mental illness (SMI; i.e., schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, and
major depressive disorder with psychotic features) are at an increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior as
compared to the general population. Despite this, there is still relatively little understanding of the mechanisms
that contribute to suicidal ideation in SMI, and people with SMI are excluded in almost 80% of biobehavioral
clinical trials. Recent research indicates that aberrant social cognitive emotion processing, in particular over-
attribution of threat, is common in psychosis and is associated with suicide ideation and behavior. Our prior
work indicates that perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness can be measured validly with
ecological momentary assessment (EMA) in SMI and relate to suicidal ideation in this population. However, the
relationships social cognitive abilities and biases, which can be objectively measured, have not been explored
in a dynamic fashion. Social cognitive interventions are effective in psychosis but to date have not been
evaluated as a component of suicide prevention. This project will evaluate real-time dynamic and longitudinal
linkages between social cognitive abilities and biases measured by a validated mobile social cognitive testing
tool, in a large sample of people SMI stratified by suicide ideation. Furthermore, the candidate will apply a
novel computational technique, network analysis adapted for EMA data, to understand time-varying factors
affecting these modifiable constructs related to suicide in psychosis. Network analyses augment traditional
within-person analyses with EMA data to evaluate complex time interdependencies among variables, including
density and time-lagged relationships. This project will utilize existing EMA, mobile cognitive, and longitudinal
in-lab data collected from an NIMH supported study that includes 304 people with SMI. This proposed F31
project aims to understand the individual time-varying relationships between over-attribution of threat, social
variables, perceived burdensomeness, and thwarted belongingness using traditional mixed-effects models,
and utilize network analyses to evaluate the interdependencies among these constructs and symptoms
between people with and without suicidal ideation. Then, this project aims to examine how these baseline
associations and networks predict ideation trajectories and suicidal behavior at 12-month follow-up. In
conjunction, the training opportunities afforded by the F31 funding mechanism will facilitate the applicant’s
long-term goal of becoming an independent investigator in the psychological and social cognitive contributors
to suicide in psychotic disorders, capable of applying sophisticated computational approaches to inform new
translational interventions including those delivered in real time through digital health. This proposal is
consistent with NIMH strategy aim 2.2.A. by evaluating novel objective mechanisms that could lead to novel
suicide intervention approaches for SMI."
10929306,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Lymphatic malformations (LMs) are complex congenital lesions composed of dilated, abnormal lymphatic
channels that can result in life-threatening morbidity due to their propensity to enlarge, encroach on nearby
anatomical structures, become infected, and cause significant pain and disfigurement. Although somatic, gain-
of-function mutations in the PIK3CA gene have been identified in LM endothelial cells (LM-ECs) and are thought
to drive aberrant lymphangiogenesis through overactivation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, the mechanisms underlying
many phenotypic abnormalities apparent in LMs, such as abnormal vessel formation and permeability, are not
fully understood. Considering the significant complications and recurrence rates of traditional treatments for LMs,
greater insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying LM pathogenesis is needed to identify novel
therapeutic targets and develop improved molecular therapies. Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) is a vascular growth factor
that plays a critical role in lymphatic development and homeostasis; however, its functions in LMs are unknown.
Utilizing a multi-omics approach (miRNA-seq, mRNA-seq, proteomics) to generate a comprehensive network of
miRNA-mRNA-protein expression in LM-ECs with gain-of-function PIK3CA mutations compared to normal
human dermal lymphatic endothelial cells, we have identified significant downregulation of Ang-2 mRNA and
protein in LM-ECs in parallel with significant upregulation of miRNAs in LM-ECs that are predicted post-
transcriptional suppressors of Ang-2, yet their function in LM-ECs is unknown. Ang-2 is also downregulated in
PIK3CA-mutant blood endothelial cells through Akt-mediated inactivation of its transcription factor, Forkhead box
O1. Ang-2 expression can be rescued with PI3K pathway inhibitors; however, this mechanism has not been
demonstrated in LMs. Considering the critical role of Ang-2 in lymphatic endothelial cell function, we hypothesize
that alternations in Ang-2 expression in LM-ECs drive their abnormal lymphangiogenic phenotype and may be a
viable therapeutic target. This hypothesis will be tested with the following specific aims: (1) define the regulatory
mechanisms driving differential expression of Ang-2 in LM-ECs and (2) define the impact of aberrant Ang-2
expression on LM-EC proliferation, migration, tube formation, and permeability. This proposal will be the first
investigation into the regulation and function of Ang-2 in LMs, potentially uncovering novel mechanisms
underlying the pathogenesis of LMs and lymphatic and vascular endothelial cell dysfunction which may improve
clinical practice and thus has significant relevance to the field of vascular biology. The overarching goal of this
proposal is to identify suitable targets for the development of deliverable, molecular therapeutics. The ACRI
Vascular Anomalies Laboratory provides an exceptional training environment, and we have assembled a
mentoring team of leaders in vascular anomalies, systems biology, and translational medicine that will facilitate
this unique and rigorous training, with the principal goal of preparing for a successful career as an independent
physician scientist."

Epidemiological data have indicated that the use of products with cannabidiol (CBD) and other cannabinoids
have increased dramatically among adults over the age of 65. Recent survey data collected in Colorado
indicate that older adults who use cannabinoids believe that it helps alleviate pain, helps improve sleep quality,
and decreases negative affect (i.e., depression, anxiety). Older adults may also be taking cannabinoids like
CBD because they believe it might have a positive impact on the progression of dementia and cognitive
decline, as popularized by a recent Discover magazine article. Given the aforementioned socioeconomic
trends, the preclinical data suggesting that CBD may be neuroprotective, and our preliminary data suggesting
that CBD impacts key biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress, it is clearly time to assess the impact of
these products on the cognitive health of older adults who are at high risk for AD. The significance of this
question is underscored by both the rapidly aging population in the U.S. (>60 million adults over the age of 65
by 2025), the prevalence of MCI (~15–20%) and Alzheimer’s (about 10% or 6-7 million), as well as the
enormous mortality, morbidity, and socioeconomic costs of AD. The proposed research will address this public
health research need with a gold standard, 24 week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial
(RCT) comparing full spectrum hemp-derived CBD, to CBD alone, and to placebo. The proposed study will
determine whether CBD impacts the progression of biomarkers related to neurodegeneration and Alzheimer’s
disease and determine whether CBD impacts measures of anxiety, depression, sleep, and pain in a population
at high risk for AD. The research will also determine whether any effects of CBD on outcomes are mediated by
the effect of CBD on biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress and/or changes in endocannabinoids.
Given the number of older adults at risk for AD who are using CBD products and given that these individuals
believe that these products are helpful, the proposed well-controlled trial will have a significant impact by
informing the public about the effects of CBD, regardless of the outcome of the analyses (positive or negative)."
10830923,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents an emerging global health threat and is a expected to double in prevalence by
2050. AD is a disease of malformed proteins, and signiﬁcant progress has been made characterizing the AD proteome
with mass spectrometery. However, data missingness represents a signiﬁcant barrier to the interpretation of existing
AD mass spectrometry experiments.
 Missingness refers to peptides or proteins that are present in the biological sample but are not detected by the mass
spectrometer due to various technical factors. This project will address missingness by developing machine learning
methods for imputing, or estimating, missing values in quantitative mass spectrometry data. The project will develop
two separate imputation methods, one using non-negative matrix factorization and the other deep neural networks.
These imputation methods will increase the reproducibility and statistical power of mass spectrometry experiments
and will enable new discoveries in existing proteomics experiments. These imputation methods will be applicable to
virtually any kind of mass spectrometry experiment – tandem mass tag, data dependent acquisition, data independent
acquisition, spectral counts, label-free quantiﬁcation, etc. These imputation methods will be released as lightweight,
open-source and easy-to-use software packages and may be incorporated into existing data processing workﬂows.
 I will demonstrate the utility of these imputation methods by reanalysing data from several existing AD proteomic
studies. My imputation methods will identify novel differentially expressed proteins, co-expression modules and AD
biomarkers in these existing datasets. I will also analyze unpublished data-independent acquisition (DIA) proteomics
data derived from AD patient cerebrospinal ﬂuid samples. Here I will focus on identifying biomarkers that differentiate
between patients based on genetic background and co-morbidity status. I will also identify biomarkers of patients with
asymptomatic AD.
 The imputation methods developed by this proposal will enable future discoveries by independent AD researchers.
This proposal aligns with the NIA Strategic Direction seeking to ""identify and understand the genetic, molecular and
cellular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of AD."""
10883556,"ABSTRACT
 Unmet sexual and reproductive healthcare (SRH) needs are a significant problem in the United States and
are associated with a broad spectrum of negative sexual and reproductive health outcomes. Consequently, it is
essential to understand the factors associated with unmet SRH needs and the characteristics of women who are
most vulnerable to unmet SRH needs. Existing research has been limited in two ways. First, quantitative research
on unmet SRH needs is often constrained by a lack of available information on women who do not receive care,
by virtue of their absence from care. Second, the paucity of robust, longitudinal data has prohibited researchers’
ability to specify how SRH experiences (and unmet needs) are connected throughout women’s lives.
 The objective of this project is to elucidate the connection between unmet SRH needs over time and to
identify the factors associated with and disparities in levels of unmet SRH needs over time. To do so, this project
will leverage an innovative mixed-methods dataset from the Person to Person (P2P) Health Interview study, a
large omnibus health study, including: (1) new in-depth interviews with reproductive-aged women in the P2P
sample (N=40), (2) linked electronic health records (EHR) of women in the P2P sample (N=1,462), and (3)
associated P2P survey data.
 To achieve the overall objective, the proposed project addresses two specific aims. Aim 1: Identify women’s
perceptions of unmet SRH needs across their lives and the conditions that contribute to those unmet needs
using in-depth interviews guided by participant’s EHR. These interviews will elicit women’s narratives of their
experiences with SRH over time and contextualize SRH events in their EHR with information about their social
circumstances and the connections between each experience and subsequent SRH utilization decisions.
Furthermore, these interviews will identify instances of unmet need and utilization not included in the EHR. Aim
2: Classify patterns in SRH usage over time using sequence analysis to compare (2a) factors and resources
associated with unmet SRH needs and (2b) sociodemographic disparities in patterns of SRH utilization. I will
evaluate the elements in each pattern against standards of preventative and acute care and women’s accounts
of their unmet needs (gathered in Aim 1) to assess the level of unmet need. I will use multinomial logistic
regression to examine the association between (a) measures of predisposing factors and enabling resources
(healthcare access, racism, trust in doctors, and social support), (b) sociodemographic characteristics and
patterns of SRH utilization with differing levels of unmet SRH need. Results from this study will generate valuable
information that can be used to develop targeted interventions to reduce unmet SRH needs, eliminate racial and
socioeconomic disparities in SRH utilization, and improve sexual and reproductive health outcomes over
women’s lives."
10876367,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The human genome encodes information that specifies the development of an entire organism comprising at
least 10 trillion cells and more than 200 different cell types. The genome also contains the information to direct
appropriate responses to a host of environmental stimuli to maintain homeostasis and respond to challenges,
e.g. from microbial pathogens. Changes to this code or dysregulation of its interpretation underlie almost all
human diseases, including chronic inflammatory diseases, metabolic disorders, and cancer. Obtaining
mechanistic and quantitative understanding of gene regulation in individual cells is a crucial
prerequisite for a better understanding, and ultimately treatment, of diseases. Studying gene regulatory
processes in human tissues has been challenging because of their cellular heterogeneity and because most
human samples are not accessible to longitudinal observations and direct perturbations. However, the advent
of single cell genomic technologies, the development of human iPSC and organoid-based in vitro model
systems, and the availability of powerful tools for genetic perturbations have the potential to overcome these
challenges and to revolutionize biomedical research. In this proposal we combine the development of single-
cell multiomic tools that accurately profile multiple regulatory features within single cells or molecules with
mechanistic and disease-focused studies to understand how genetic and environmental perturbations of gene
regulatory processes disrupt cellular differentiation and underlie pathologies."
10936539,"Neurodegenerative diseases are one of the greatest threats to modern health, and there are few treatments available for these complex and progressive diseases. This proposal investigates the basic biology underlying progranulin (PGRN), a lysosomal protein whose haploinsufficiency causes the Alzheimer’s Disease-Related Dementia (ADRD) frontotemporal dementia (FTD) [1]. While PGRN deficiency is one of the leading genetic causes of FTD, its function is not completely understood. To further our understanding of the causes and pathophysiology of FTD, it’s imperative to determine the endogenous functions of PGRN in the lysosome. PGRN is inextricably linked with another lysosomal pro-protein, prosaposin (PSAP), which is also implicated in progranulin-FTD [2]. PSAP is cleaved into sphingolipidase activator proteins called saposins, which catalyze sphingolipid metabolism in the lysosome. Loss of saposins perturbs lysosomal lipase activity, resulting in accumulation of sphingolipids and lysosomal dysfunction. Interestingly, perturbed sphingolipid metabolism has recently emerged as a critical risk factor for the onset and progression of ADRDs, including FTD [3-11]. Moreover, PGRN has been implicated in ADRD-related dysregulation in lipid homeostasis [12, 13], however, the underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown. Together, this suggests a pathway where the FTD-risk factor PGRN regulates lipid homeostasis via PSAP, which in turn contributes to ADRD pathophysiology. Despite the clear role for saposins in sphingolipid metabolism, the mechanism by which saposins are released from PSAP, and thus available to modulate sphingolipidases, sphingolipid homeostasis, and downstream lysosomal function, is not well understood. I hypothesize that PSAP cleavage into saposins is subject to regulation by lysosomal enzymes, the FTD-risk factor PGRN, and age, and that regulation of PSAP cleavage plays a crucial role in lipid homeostasis and lysosome function. To test this hypothesis, I propose a several innovative experiments with recombinant human proteins in vitro, human cell lines, and in in vivo behavioral and imaging techniques in Caenorhabditis elegans. I will utilize well-established protocols for both in vitro protease function and C. elegans phenotypes alongside newly developed techniques to measure lysosomal pH and lipid content in vivo. I will determine how PGRN regulates the cleavage of PSAP into saposins, if PGRN influences lipid homeostasis via its regulation of PSAP, and how altered lipid homeostasis impacts lysosomal function. Successful completion of this proposal will fill a gap in knowledge about the basic biology underlying the relationship and function of the FTD-risk factors PGRN and PSAP in the lysosome and elucidate a critical link between PGRN and altered lipid homeostasis in ADRD via the lysosomal function of PSAP. Successful completion of this proposal will expand our understanding of FTD by generating fundamental knowledge on the endogenous function of the endolysosomal system in protein and lipid homeostasis, which could be the key to the generation of novel diagnostic techniques, prevention strategies, and treatments for FTD, AD, and other ADRDs.

New Methods for the Synthesis and Study of Bioactive Nitrogen-Containing Molecules
PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The ubiquitous presence of nitrogen atom in small-molecule probes and drugs highlights the significance of
nitrogen-containing molecules in biomedical research and drug discovery. Rapid and efficient synthesis of
structurally diverse nitrogen-containing skeletons is of the utmost importance, as is the ability to understand
their biology, pharmacology and potential as chemical probes and drug candidates. Thus, developing new
methods for the synthesis and study of novel nitrogen-containing molecules is significant and necessary to
advance our understanding of human disease and the discovery of new therapies. The broad availability of
drugs is directly dependent on the existence of cost-efficient methods that can reliably build such novel
molecular structures and uncover their biological activity and therapeutic promise. The long-term goal of our
research is to establish a chemical platform that expedite the synthesis and development of novel small-
molecule probes and tools toward advancing the understanding and treatment of human disease. The
objective of this project is to develop new catalytic selective alkene aminofunctionalization methods that enable
rapid and efficient access to structurally complex and richly functionalized novel nitrogen-containing molecules
from readily available alkene as starting materials. Toward this, this application will exploit the electrophilic
amination strategy based on the unique and diverse reactivity of heteroatom-nitrogen bonds––readily available
yet traditionally underutilized nitrogen precursors––to design new C–N bond formation reactions that are
different but complementary to existing methods. Successful implementation of these studies will greatly
facilitate the synthesis and study of a wide range of nitrogen-containing molecules that are difficult or
impossible to access with current technologies. Lessons learned in reaction engineering for efficacy and
selectivity will be applicable to the invention and development of useful chemical processes, beyond amination
chemistry. Overall, these new abilities are highly valuable and important in organic synthesis, medicinal
chemistry, biomedical research, and drug discovery, by greatly contributing to the expansion of novel chemical
space and diversity of N-containing molecules as well as the discovery of new lead compounds and small-
molecule probes."

Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease of unknown etiology that affects multiple organs, especially
the lungs. It has a wide range of clinical outcomes, including progressive lung disease and multi-organ
involvement. Due to the lack of reliable or validated markers for these outcomes, sarcoidosis presents many
challenges to clinicians, especially in light of the toxicities from immunosuppressive therapies used as treatment.
My goal for this K23 award is to determine how specific immune cells and proteins relate to systemic organ
burden and pulmonary function in sarcoidosis patients. While accomplishing this goal, I will pursue a rigorous
career development plan to expand my skills in clinical research methods and T cell biology. The blood markers
I will study are biologically linked to IFN-γ, an essential cytokine in sarcoidosis inflammation. These markers
include: 1) a specific subset of T helper cells that can produce high amounts of IFN-γ and 2) serum levels of
chemokines induced by IFN-γ that traffic immune cells to inflamed tissues. I have generated preliminary data for
these markers using a well-phenotyped longitudinal sarcoidosis cohort established by my primary mentor, Dr.
Laura Koth. The T cell population of interest is defined by production of the transcription factor T-bet, which
regulates IFN-γ production. Using multi-parameter flow cytometry, I identified a population of T helper cells that
have distinctly high levels of T-bet protein (T-betHi cells). These T-betHi cells were present almost exclusively in
subjects with pulmonary function test (PFT) declines. Initial in vitro assays of these cells suggest that they have
exceptionally high capacity to produce IFN-γ. Aim 1 will determine how IFN-γ production in these T-betHi cells
relates to their potential pathogenicity. The second group of markers includes three IFN-γ-induced chemokines
(CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11), which were the subject of two of my recent publications. I showed that serum
levels of these chemokines had distinct associations with the longitudinal pulmonary function changes and organ
involvement. These associations may be due to their underlying biology and therefore carry specific relevance
in the disease. Thus, in Aims 2 and 3, I will determine the relationship of both T-betHi cells and these chemokines
to outcomes in two sarcoidosis cohorts. I have been helping Dr. Koth enroll subjects into these cohorts and I run
study visits to collect the clinical data I will use in this proposal. These cohorts include subjects with newly
diagnosed disease who have repeated follow-up over up to two years. I will determine how these markers relate
longitudinally to the number of organs affected (Aim 2) and pulmonary function (Aim 3). In addition to offering
direct involvement with these cohorts, Dr. Koth, will share her lab space and provide support to measure these
blood markers. I will also benefit from the clinical research and biostatistical and expertise of my co-mentors,
Drs. Woodruff and Allen. As part of my training plan, I will supplement skills I have acquired during my Master's
in Clinical Research through additional epidemiology and statistics coursework. During this award I will generate
data to apply for R01 funding to become an independently funded clinical and translational researcher."
10881242,"Summary
Symptomatology associated with emotion dysregulation (including depression) has been identified as a critical
early indicator of neurodegeneration preceding cognitive impairment in preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD).
One of the primary symptoms is loss of inhibitory control of negative affective arousal in the absence of
significant cognitive complaints or dementia. When persistent and onsetting >age 50, it has been linked to
increased risk of AD and predictor of accelerated cognitive decline, particularly in women. In AG057505, we
have been investigating sex differences in the fetal immune programming of aging of brain regions associated
with depression and associated loss of inhibitory control of negative emotion. These include hypothalamus,
locus coeruleus (LC), amygdala, hippocampus, anterior cingulate, and prefrontal cortex, some of which are
shared with memory circuitry, vulnerable to early AD in midlife, and highly sexually dimorphic. In this competing
renewal of AG057505, we will test the hypothesis that neuroimmune and vascular pathways, in part, underlie
shared dysregulation of emotion/mood and memory circuitries, the former of which will begin prior to memory
decline and AD pathology, with women having greater risk for decline and AD pathology than men. We are
uniquely poised to examine this given that, in AG057505, we prospectively followed 160 offspring (equally
divided by sex) from our prenatal cohort from 2nd/3rd trimesters to ages 55-61. We will re-recruit over 5 years
the 160 offspring at ages 61-70 and relate maternal prenatal immune activity to sex differences in emotion
circuitry deficits/depression at ages 55-61 on memory circuitry, AD pathology, and neurovascular deficits at
ages 61-70, and cognitive decline over the 5 years. As in AG057507, the same multimodal imaging
(sMRI/fMRI/DTI) will be used coupled with hormones, autonomic and immune physiology, novel genomic
approach assessing innate immune gene expression, and emotion regulation and cognitive measures. Further,
we will add as outcomes an fMRI associative memory task, AD blood-based biomarkers, and novel ultra-high
field imaging of neurovascular structure/function, and PET amyloid imaging for half the sample to localize
amyloid accumulation. We predict that immune dysregulation, beginning prenatally, will lead to early alterations
in microvascular circulation of the LC (site of early amyloid and tau deposition) and associated emotion
circuitry dysregulation, that precedes development of AD pathology, neurovascular structural/functional
deficits, and memory decline, that we predict will be worse in women than men. There is a lack of studies that
can prospectively investigate the impact of emotion dysregulation/depression preceding cognitive decline and
AD pathology and uniquely investigate the impact of sex. Our approach is innovative and may identify potential
sex-selective targets (early risk modifiers) to attenuate disability and/or prevent memory decline and AD, such
as immune system and/or neurovascular targets in early midlife for maintaining intact memory."
10881305,"Project Summary/Abstract. Indiana State University serves a broad student base from diverse
backgrounds. A large fraction (38%) of our students are Pell Grant eligible (47% of first-year, full-time
freshmen). Our students are a mix of students from urban and rural environments including a large
fraction from underserved communities.
We are requesting an instrument consisting of a capillary gas chromatograph coupled to a high-resolution
mass spectrometer capable of tandem mass spectrometry. The instrument will be used for
chromatographic separation of complex mixtures; determination of molecular formulas from accurate
mass measurement; identification of unknown compounds through electron impact and chemical
ionization fragmentation patterns; and data-dependent tandem mass spectrometry and high sensitivity
trace analysis using selected reaction monitoring. This instrument will replace a heavily used existing low-
resolution instrument which is reaching the end of its serviceable life and which no longer meets our
research needs.
This instrument will support three faculty research projects across three departments involving three
tenured faculty with extensive records of engaging undergraduates in research, two untenured faculty,
one a new hire in biochemistry. These faculty projects will provide biomedically relevant research and
teaching experiences to students across a range of backgrounds in chemistry, biology and environmental
science including metabolomics and trace analysis. Research and Educational projects to be supported
include 1. A Public Database for Discovery of Neuroactive Alkaloids in Poison Frogs, 2. Analysis of Pesticides
and Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS/PFOS) in Game Animals, 3. Rationally Redesigning Cytochrome P450s
for Direct C-H Amination 4. Lipidomics of Pseudomonas aeruginosa CYP168A1 Metabolism (CHEM 431L).
5. Techniques in Metabolomics and Proteomics
These projects will engage 6-8 chemistry undergraduate and 1-2 biology/EES graduate students each year
in research during our Summer Undergraduate Research Experiences (SURE) program. Use in laboratory
courses will involve over 100 students each academic year in Sophomore Organic, Advanced Organic,
Inorganic and Biochemistry as well as a new combined course in metabolomics and proteomics being
developed. This state-of-the-art instrument and bioinformatics/chemoinformatics platforms will enhance
the research environment at Indiana State University and enable our students to pursue graduate and
professional degrees in biomedically relevant fields. The objectives in this project are relevant to the
institutional missions of NIGMS, NINDS, NIMH and NCATS as well as other institutes not involved in the
program such as NIEHS and NIDA."
10915736,"ADMINISTRATIVE CORE PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The primary objective of the Administrative (Admin) Core is to integrate, coordinate, and manage components
of all components of ZAMBAMA (i.e., the two research projects and two additional cores). The Admin core is
also responsible for all budgetary (e.g., processing payments, ordering supplies) and regulatory activities (e.g.,
communication with NIAAA, coordination of Data Safety Monitoring Board activities, IRB activity, tracking
adverse events), monitoring and managing overall progress, and promoting coordination and collaboration
among investigators within and outside of the program.
The Specific Aims of the Admin core are the following: 1) Synchronize scientific aims and foster shared scientific
progress between the projects; 2) Manage overarching program business and regulatory requirements; and 3)
Enhance collaboration among investigators within and outside of the program. Through this Program Project
Grant, we will leverage the infrastructure of our cores, research projects, and infrastructure to achieve our overall
aims to 1) better characterize the overlapping burden of mental illness and substance use comorbidity among
PLWH with unhealthy alcohol use, 2) evaluate whether and how comorbidity impacts alcohol reduction
intervention outcomes, 3) determine the effectiveness of a transdiagnostic cognitive behavioral therapy, and 4)
examine implementation factors related to integrated delivery of alcohol reduction interventions to disadvantaged
PLWH at front-line HIV clinics. The proposed work is integrated and synergistic, and the Admin Core function to
leverage this program’s infrastructure, collaborative relationships, and multidisciplinary expertise to achieve
goals that are greater than the sum of its individual parts."
10915737,"Project Summary/Abstract
Unhealthy alcohol use is a major unaddressed barrier to control of the HIV epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa and
the United States. The Zambia Alabama HIV Alcohol Comorbidities Program (ZAMBAMA) aims to address this
barrier through the following overarching aims: (Aim 1) test the effectiveness of a transdiagnostic treatment
model (Common Elements Treatment Approach [CETA]) to reduce unhealthy alcohol use and improve HIV
clinical outcomes; (Aim 2) evaluate the mechanisms through which CETA impacts HIV outcomes; (Aim 3)
investigate whether the treatment effect of CETA varies by clinical (e.g., presence of mental health
comorbidities), demographic (e.g., gender) and contextual (e.g., Zambia, Alabama) factors; and (Aim 4) examine
implementation factors, including cost, related to integrated delivery of alcohol reduction interventions to
disadvantaged people with HIV and unhealthy alcohol use at front-line HIV clinics. The CETA Core will provide
clinical oversight to ZAMBAMA’s two clinical trials and promote integration and synergy with the program. The
Core’s specific aims are (a) train providers in CETA and an alcohol brief intervention in Zambia and Alabama,
(b) provide continuous clinical supervision to the newly trained providers throughout the study periods, (c)
evaluate the clinical competency, knowledge, and fidelity of newly trained providers and supervisors. The Core
is led by the developers of CETA and the alcohol BI who have trained providers and used these interventions in
sub-Saharan Africa and the U.S. CETA is a multi-problem, modular, cognitive behavioral therapy-based model
that is delivered over 6-12 sessions and was found to be effective for a range of mental health symptoms,
unhealthy alcohol use, and other substance use in several previous controlled clinical trials. Although developed
to address severe gaps in the professional mental health workforce in low-income settings, CETA is increasingly
used in the U.S. In ZAMBAMA’s two clinical trials, BI plus referral to CETA will be compared with BI alone for
adults with HIV and unhealthy alcohol use at resource-limited clinics, and the program’s central hypothesis that
screening and treatment of psychiatric comorbidities is critical to improving clinical outcomes in people with HIV
and unhealthy alcohol use."

use at front-line HIV clinics. The Methods and Analysis Core (MAC) will support ZAMBAMA’s two clinical trials
and promote integration and synergy within the program. The specific aims of MAC are (1) implement the
scientific approach of both trials (e.g., overseeing randomization procedures, measurement tools, and data
management); (2) conduct primary and secondary outcomes analyses evaluating CETA’s effectiveness
(including moderator analyses); (3) conduct mediator/mechanisms analysis investigating the degree to which
CETA’s impact on HIV outcomes are mediated by reductions in alcohol use, substance use, and mental health
problems; (4) analyze and interpret alcohol biomarker (phosphatidylethanol) data used to confirm self-reported
alcohol abstinence data; and (5) analyze implementation and cost effectiveness data to inform the scale-up and
sustainability potential of CETA. MAC will be staffed by investigators with international and multidisciplinary
expertise in research methods, including in substance use, HIV, clinical trials, and global health. MAC will
leverage a wealth of information technology, statistical, and laboratory resources at participating institutions,
including Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, Columbia University, and the University of Alabama
at Birmingham. Harmonized patient reported outcome measures and a centralized team to oversee the
intervention (i.e., CETA core) for both trials will create unique opportunities to understand the interplay between
unhealthy alcohol use and psychiatric comorbidities, whether and how comorbidities influence alcohol treatment
outcomes, and how differences in delivery modality and contextual factors impact CETA’s effectiveness."
10915740,"Project Summary/Abstract
The intersection of unhealthy alcohol use and HIV infection is most significant in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) where
HIV prevalence exceeds 20% in some populations and alcohol consumption is on the rise. Most HIV treatment
and prevention programs in SSA do not have evidence-based alcohol interventions and the professional mental
health workforce is extremely limited. Alcohol brief interventions (BI), which have been moderately effective in
other settings, were not effective in SSA for unhealthy alcohol use among people with HIV in several previous
trials. Unhealthy alcohol use is often complicated by comorbid mental illness and/or other substance use. We
previously demonstrated the feasibility, acceptability, and potential effectiveness of a transdiagnostic model
called Common Elements Treatment Approach (CETA) for people with HIV and unhealthy alcohol use. CETA
was designed for delivery by lay providers (non-professionals with limited or no previous mental health
experience) and can address a range of conditions (including unhealthy alcohol use) within a single protocol
delivered over 6-12 therapy sessions. CETA was evaluated in 3 previous randomized trials and found to be
effective for a range of conditions in trauma-affected and marginalized populations. CETA HIV Alcohol Reduction
Trial in Zambia (CHARTZ), a research project within the Zambia Alabama HIV Alcohol Comorbidities Program,
is a hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial to evaluate the effects of CETA, and a novel alcohol BI, on HIV,
alcohol, and comorbidity outcomes. Adults (18+ years old) with HIV, unhealthy alcohol use, and suboptimal
engagement in HIV care at public sector HIV clinics in Lusaka will be enrolled and randomized to the standard
of care (ART adherence counseling), BI alone, or BI plus CETA. The BI and CETA will be provided by HIV peer
educators, a cadre of lay counselors who are embedded at HIV clinics across Zambia. Patient reported outcome
measures (for alcohol use, mental illness, and other substance use) and HIV electronic medical records (for ART
adherence, retention in HIV care, viral suppression) will be used to assess trial eligibility and evaluate outcomes
at 6 and 12 months. Phosphatidylethanol, a direct alcohol biomarker, will be measured to strengthen assessment
of trial outcomes. Implementation factors related to the integrated delivery of CETA and the BI will be evaluated
including cost and cost effectiveness. In summary, CHARTZ will generate evidence on psychological treatments
for unhealthy alcohol use that have strong potential for implementation in low-resource settings and can address
complex and overlapping behavioral issues that undermine HIV treatment and prevention."
10893984,"Quantitative Radiology holds great promise to transform our ability to diagnose, monitor, stage, prognosticate,
and detect diseases as well as to plan and guide patient therapeutic interventions. However, the process of
locating and delineating anatomic organs and pathologic regions in medical images, known as image
segmentation, at a high level of automation has remained a major hurdle to these advances. Most
developments on image segmentation have focused on a specific organ or a small group of objects in a
specific body region. A new method or a major adaptation of an existing method is engineered when any of
these parameters changed. Such an approach is not sustainable and becomes a stumbling block when dealing
with whole-body systemic diseases where body-wide image analytics is required. A critical advance is needed
in this field to overcome two main challenges: (1) Although prior information about normal anatomy is deemed
vital for image segmentation and analysis, its creation and utilization body-wide on a massive scale have not
been attempted and are sorely lacking. (2) Techniques to employ such information and methods for body-wide
disease quantification at high levels of automation do not exist. The overarching goal
is to overcome these
challenges by developing a body-wide and generalizable anatomy-guided deep learning image segmentation
methodology
and demonstrate its application in the study of patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma
(DLBCL) for which PET-based staging and response assessment are of paramount importance.
The project has three specific aims. Aim1: To develop a family of body-wide anatomy models representing the
entire human adult age spectrum.
Existing FDG PET/CT scans of 600 patients from two institutions (Penn and
New York Proton Center) covering 10 age groups will be utilized to build anatomy models involving 50 organs
and 50 lymph node zones in the extended body torso including neck, thorax, abdomen, and pelvis.
A family of
40 anatomy models representing the 4 body regions and 10 age groups will be created from roughly 60,000 3D
object samples. Aim2: To develop, implement, and validate a methodology for localizing objects and to
quantify disease without explicitly delineating organs and lesions. Gender- and age-specific anatomy models
will be utilized for automatically locating the above 100 objects in any given patient PET/CT image and to
quantify disease in each body region, organ, and lymph node zone. The methods will be tested on 400 PET/CT
images of DLBCL patients. Aim3: To develop and validate an automated method of DLBCL disease staging
and prognosis. The disease quantity information will be utilized to develop automated staging and outcome
prediction algorithms which will be tested on the above 400 cases in comparison to current clinical methods.
Two key outcomes of this project will be: an unprecedented well-curated database of body-wide images,
segmented objects, and family of models; and a validated methodology for automatic body-wide disease
quantification and disease staging in DLBCL."
10985016,"Emerging research suggests that changes in sexual functioning after concussion/mild traumatic brain injury
(mTBI) are common in women of reproductive age (18-45years). Findings from my pilot research show that
61.3% of women who sustain a concussion report sexual dysfunctions (SD)-defined as disordered sexual
interest, desire, arousal or satisfaction-compared to 40% of extremity injured controls of similar menstrual and
birth control status. Although concussion symptoms typically resolve within weeks, this line of research
demonstrates that for a subgroup of patients, symptoms can linger into months if not years, and can adversely
affect an important, yet understudied, aspect of women’s health and function.
 Human sexuality, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), is an essential aspect of health, a
central aspect of “being human.” Poor sexual functioning assumes pathology in the experience of sexual
arousal, interest, desire and response, and it has been associated with adverse physical and mental health. It
is a marker of quality of life (QOL). In order to decrease the public health burden of mTBI and improve the
clinical care of women with concussion, research is needed to identify women at greatest risk for post-
concussion SD. Understanding sex-difference in TBI outcomes and the unique challenges faced by women
with TBI is a priority for the Neurology’s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS).
 This K01 application proposes a research plan that incorporates hormonal biomarkers as a novel risk
stratification tool to identify high risk groups of female concussion patients. Study participants will use the
Ovia® digital reproductive health tracking application (app) and other validated questionnaires to document
their sexual activities and relevant covariates.
 In Aim 1 we test the hypothesis that compared to women with extremity injuries, concussed women will a)
have a lower mean score on the BIQS measure of sexual function and b) have fewer sexual encounters
reported with Ovia app, evaluated at 1& 3-months post-injury.
 In Aim 2 we test if women with mTBI injured during the luteal menstrual phase will have a higher risk of SD
than women with mTBI injured during the follicular menstrual phase (lower mean score on BIQS and fewer
sexual encounters with app); and if the magnitude of the association will be significantly higher for women with
mTBI than for women with extremity injuries.
 I will receive mentoring, career advising and training to develop an independent research program that
bridges my epidemiologic skillset with my interests in neurology and reproductive epidemiology."
10808136,"Overview Abstract/Summary
The overarching theme of the Penn Mental Health AIDS Research Center (PMHARC) at the University of
Pennsylvania (Penn), Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), and Wistar Institute (Wistar) is to transform
how individuals with comorbid mental illness/AIDS are treated and managed by developing innovative,
interdisciplinary, and integrative approaches to optimize psychiatric, behavioral, and medical outcomes and
achieving a better understanding of the biological, psychological, and behavioral mechanisms underlying these
combined illnesses and treatments. No other center in the U.S. is currently pursuing this explicit focus, making
PMHARC unique in the NIMH ARC portfolio. A substantial body of work links psychiatric disorders to
acquisition of HIV infection, accelerated immune dysfunction, poor access to HIV care, and poor adherence to
antiretroviral treatment once in care. Yet, there remains a relative paucity of evidence-based interventions
focused on the combined treatment of mental illness/HIV and related medical co-morbidities, and relatively little
work in determining the relationships between mental health treatment and HIV disease and understanding the
underlying biology. PMHARC will continue to stimulate novel approaches and strategies to address these
problems by providing mentoring and resource support for both new and established investigators choosing
to study comorbid mental illness/HIV, in part through innovative pilot studies. PMHARC's leadership has
extensive expertise in contemporary pharmacotherapy of mental illness and HIV, cognitive behavioral
treatments, and theory-based behavioral interventions. PMHARC will extend well-established collaborations at
Penn, CHOP, and Wistar including those in the Department of Psychiatry and the CFAR, as well as with the
CTSA/CTRC, the Delaney Collaboratory, and community partners in Philadelphia. A unique feature of
PMHARC is the collaboration of well established mental health/HIV researchers, well-established mental
health researchers who have not previously studied HIV, well-established substance use/HIV researchers who
have not previously studied mental health, and HIV researchers not previously focused on mental health.
PMHARC has an Administrative and Developmental Core, and four Shared Resource Cores."
10808137,"CORE A: Abstract/Summary
Core A provides leadership, management, organizational structure, fiscal oversight, and scientific direction to
the Penn Mental Health AIDS Research Center (PMHARC), enabling it to fulfill its core mission to transform how
people with both mental illness and HIV are treated and managed, an explicit focus not currently pursued by any
other NIMH AIDS Research Center (ARC). PMHARC is unique in: 1) its scientific focus on mental health issues
in HIV through an integration of basic, biological and social and behavioral sciences; 2) its unique behavioral
and specimen repository and status as the only Behavioral ARC with a Laboratory and Biobehavioral Markers
Core; 3) its development of a successful co-funding model with CFAR for PMHARC pilots; and 4) its status as
the only NIMH Behavioral ARC collaborating with the NIMH Neuro ARCs in the NIMH Joint Seminar Series. The
Center and Core A is led by a Director and two Co-Directors with exceptional and complementary strengths and
experience in administration, research, and training and in the study of comorbid mental illness/HIV. PMHARC
is located in an optimal intellectual and resource environment, which encompasses robust and well-regarded
mental health and HIV research communities on the Penn/CHOP/Wistar contiguous campuses. Through Core
A, PMHARC will continue to optimize psychiatric, behavioral, and medical outcomes for those with comorbid
mental illness/HIV and elucidate the biological, psychological, and behavioral mechanisms underlying these
combined illnesses and treatments. Core A has created an interactive environment that fosters communication,
collaboration, and synergy among Center components and participants, as well as with the relevant schools,
departments, centers, and institutes at Penn/CHOP/Wistar including CFAR, CTSA, Delaney Collaboratories at
Wistar and Temple, and other ARCs. Core A will be engaged and responsible for: 1) coordinating interdisciplinary
and collaborative mental health/HIV research; 2) encouraging, supporting, and mentoring new, established, and
transitional investigators to focus on comorbid mental illness/HIV, and related comorbidities; 3) developing
vibrant and responsive Strategic Planning, Monitoring, and Evaluation Processes and comprehensive Policies
and Procedures; 4) managing fiscal matters; 5) conducting educational and community outreach programs; 6)
fostering national linkages among other ARCs; and 7) supporting an active Community Advisory Board (CAB).
Core A also includes 3 Consultants, Executive Committee (EC), Internal Advisory Board (IAB), External Advisory
Committee (EAC), Research Innovation and Diversity Committee (RIDC), and CAB. This structure is explicitly
intended to allow for continuous monitoring and evaluation in order to optimize efficiencies and responsiveness.
In its first two cycles, PMHARC has made impressive progress in: advancing Diversity/ Inclusion; engaging
investigators in combined HIV/mental health research and promoting research infrastructure; identifying,
mentoring, and promoting career advancement of Early Stage Investigators (ESIs); and producing an impressive
return on investment of the pilot award program."
10808139,"CORE B: Abstract/Summary
The Developmental Core (Core B) supports the overall mission of the PMHARC through its management of the
pilot projects program. During the current funding cycle, Core B, in partnership with the Administrative Core and
the PMHARC Executive Committee (EC) implemented a rigorous and efficient web-based system for the
submission, review, and selection of high priority pilot research focused on mental health and HIV prevention
and care. The pilot projects program is central to the overall mission of the PMARC and provides the framework
for the delivery of much of the Center’s training and mentoring services. With the assistance of all Cores, Core
B leads the solicitation of research concepts that are reviewed for consideration to submit a proposal. During
this funding cycle, the PMHARC used approximately 10% of its annual total costs to support a total of 30 pilot
projects that have been funded with awards ranging from $15,000 to $40,000 with an overall total of $795,390.
Seven of these projects were co-funded by the PENN CFAR during this cycle. Identifying and assisting early
career investigators and investigators from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups has been and will remain
a high priority of the Core. During this funding cycle, 37 early career and transitioning investigators have been
engaged in pilot projects, 23% of pilot PIs are from racial and ethnic minority groups and 57% are women. All
Cores are available to support pilot investigators who are encouraged to participate in services supported by
Core B, such as the monthly recruitment support group and the monthly PMHARC Journal Club. We are working
to build a community of researchers able to address important topics at the intersection of HIV and mental health.
During the next funding cycle, we will build on the success of the PMHARC pilot projects program by expanding
the number of Centers and Institutes able to co-fund pilot research. The Core will be an active participant in the
Research Innovation and Diversity Committee to help identify potential pilot applicants and funding opportunities
following completion of pilot projects. The pilot funding and related training and development delivered by Core
B supports the overall mission of the PMHARC by expanding the number and capacity of investigators to conduct
innovative and important mental health and AIDS research. By supporting promising pilot research the Core will
initiate research programs that have real potential to improve the mental health and quality of life of HIV positive
individuals and to improve access to needed services."
10808143,"CORE C Abstract/Summary
The Clinical Assessment Core provides a range of services to Center investigators related to clinical
assessments. Specifically, the Clinical Assessment Core will: (1) provide to PMHARC-related studies clinical
and self-report behavioral assessments administered by highly trained core personnel; (2) provide
diagnostician recruitment, training, and ongoing calibration in order to maintain high quality; (3) oversee the
administration of a core battery in all Center pilot treatment studies and (where possible) R01s that includes
the Risk Assessment Battery, the BASIS-24, the PROMIS Depression scale, the PROMIS Social Roles scale,
and the Social Needs Scale; (4) provideconsultation on a broad range of behavioral, social determinants of
health, neuropsychological, and medication adherence measures to PMHARC investigators. By providing a
shared diagnostic assessment resource, the Clinical Assessment Core maximizes the quality of assessments
and minimizes cost for all Center investigators (diagnostic assessments are provided to PMHARC pilot studies
at no cost). By administering the same core battery measures across all studies, the Core is able to compile a
pooled database with substantially larger sample sizes. This larger database will enable Center investigators to
ask broader questions about the interactions of psychiatric status and HIV disease status and examine
subpopulations stratified by gender, race, and ethnicity.The Clinical Assessment Core will continuously monitor
and regularly evaluate each of the services that it will provide. Summary of the feedback from investigators will
be given to the Center Executive Committee, InternalAdvisory Board, and External Advisory Committee for
comments and suggestions. The Clinical Assessment Core will be directed by Mary Beth Gibbons, who has
extensive experience in the assessment of patients for psychiatric studies, and co- directed by Robert Gross,
who has extensive experience in the treatment of patients with HIV/AIDS and in assessing adherence to
medications, and Cobb Scott, who is experienced in the neuropsychological assessment of HIV+ patients."
10808146,"CORE D Abstract/Summary
The Community Engagement Core (Core D) will provide a range of services to Center investigators to link
with our community partners and to train investigators and providers to implement a broad range of
interventions for treatment of mental illness, HIV, and their comorbidities. Specifically, Core D will: 1) provide
linkage to community partners where we have established relationships using expert services to support
successful implementation of HIV intervention projects, 2) provide expert consultation on the design of HIV
Intervention projects with consistent consideration of integration of both biomedical and behavioral science,
and 3: provide expert training that imparts knowledge and skills related to biomedical and behavioral scientific
approaches to HIV interventions. Many projects that Core D will support will be completed using established
and standard methods, and we have an explicit preference for using manualized treatments in “real world”
settings and comparative effectiveness and implementation science research methods. In general, Core D will
utilize personnel effort that is supported by the Core for pilot projects and preparation of funding proposals,
with the subsequent funded grants providing direct support of the resulting collaborative research effort. We
have established a monthly HIV recruitment support group in collaboration with CFAR. The recruitment
support group aids with recruitment efforts and has evolved into a joint effort within Penn including PMHARC,
CFAR, HVTN and Martin Delaney Collaboratory, as well as other local universities including Temple and
Drexel University. Core D is dedicated to building a portfolio over time that will combine comparative
effectiveness research, translation and implementation science, and community-based participatory research
(CBPR) methods. Building on the unique capacities available at Penn and in the Philadelphia area, the
Community Engagement Core will collaborate with other centers and institutes such as the Leonard Davis
Institute of Health Economics in the Wharton School and the Annenberg Public Policy Center to conduct cost-
effectiveness and other policy relevant analysis to plan for targeted dissemination to influence public health
policy regarding treatment of HIV among persons with psychiatric conditions. We will aid in grant proposal
preparation; and potential users of the Core will be alerted of the resources. We also provide a home for the
Community Advisory Board (CAB) which will continue to assist with recruitment of participants for research
trials and dissemination of findings in the community."
10808149,"ABSTRACT
Consistent with the Center’s theme, the mission of Core E is to facilitate a broad range of biological and
behavioral intervention studies that are designed to optimize psychiatric, behavioral, and medical outcomes
among persons with HIV (PWH). During next funding cycle the Core E will continue to offer basic panel assays
(Aim 1) and sample repository (Aim 4) for all Pilot Projects, as well as design and implement novel assays and
encourage utilization of omics (Aim 2) and MRI technology (Aim 3) where appropriate. This Core will perform
laboratory and imaging assessments that define the mental illnesses and comorbidities related to HIV/AIDS
and unique modeling and measurements related to various behavioral and pharmacologic interventions. The
Core will benefit from the major strengths of the Perelman School of Medicine (PSOM), Children's Hospital of
Philadelphia (CHOP), Centers, Departments, and Schools at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) and Wistar
Institute. We will identify specific and potentially unique biomarkers which are related to mental illness and to
comorbidities of HIV/AIDS. These data will be collected for all subjects to be studied in pilots and other Cores.
The Core will perform assays of body fluids and cells including markers of immunity, inflammation, stress, and
health. The Core will also carry out neuroimaging and provide guidance on neurocognitive measures. The
Core will perform assessments related to therapeutics for HIV, mental health, and comorbidities. The Core is
directed by two senior investigators, Drs. Jordan-Sciutto, and Gur. Dr. Douglas will retain a consulting role with

10891484,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Africa faces a growing burden of non-communicable diseases as the fastest growing cause of morbidity
and mortality, many of which are neurological disorders. Clinical studies are the foundation advancements in
medicine allowing scientists to test the efficacy and safety of a drug, therapy or strategy; and clinical
neuroscience research holds great promise to help mitigate the toll of neurological disease. However, the studies
that lead to discovery of causal /risk factors & drugs/interventions rarely emanate from African populations, which
bear a major brunt of neurological diseases. With the rise of precision medicine utilizing tailored interventions,
lack of race-ethnic diversity in generating evidence-based treatments can be a challenge if people of African
ancestry are to truly benefit from these targeted therapies. One way to bolster the limited pool of researchers in
Africa conducting neurological research and trials is to expose select individuals to coordinated education,
training, mentoring, & networking opportunities, thereby raising their odds of becoming successful clinical
researchers, thus creating a cadre of people on the continent making academic contributions to the overall field
of neurological diseases, including those conditions endemic to Africa. The goal of the Training Africans to Lead
and Execute Neurological Trials & Studies (TALENTS) program, is to build sustainable neurological research
capacity in Africa through partnerships between US and African organizations. Six scholars will be accepted into
the program each year and exposed to educational, mentoring, & networking activities. TALENTS Specific Aims
are: 1) To select & retain 24 promising multidisciplinary scholars from a cross-national pool) committed to careers
in neurological research; 2) To increase scholars' scientific knowledge, professional skills, motivation, &
credentials, in neurological research (Certificate Program, Master’s degree in Clinical Research, Think Tank
Sessions, and Scientific Conference events); 3) To enhance mentoring benefits and networking opportunities for
Scholars (congruent one-on-one mentoring approach and online networking activities); 4) By end of the grant
period to create an independent Master’s degree in Neurological Research at the University of Ibadan in Nigeria,
with several member of the faculty being recent TALENTS trainees; 5) To evaluate the effectiveness of the
Program. We anticipate that TALENTS will establish a sustainable network of individuals with expertise in
neurological research poised to assume leadership and academic faculty roles in Africa, and able to mentor
successive generations of locally well-trained and successful neurological researchers in the region."

Currently, supervised surgical training provides only a small fraction of surgical experience in the career of a practicing
surgeon. Surgeons’ skill develops throughout their career. Surgeons benefit from supervised feedback from experts during
training, but they lose such structured and specific feedback once they begin independent practice. Surgical skill is
associated with patient outcomes. Therefore, supporting surgeons’ continuous professional learning through automated
structured resources can improve patient care. The status quo for surgeons in practice is to measure patient outcomes or
other process of care variables as indirect measures of their skill. These measures do not inform surgeons how to improve.
The goal in this project is to develop tools to analyze videos of the surgical field to provide surgeons with unbiased skill
assessments and specific feedback on how to improve. This project includes integration of these tools into a personalized
surgical learning platform and evaluation of its effectiveness for surgeons’ skill acquisition. To achieve this goal, this project
includes a multi-disciplinary team to include expertise in ophthalmology, surgical education, surgical data science, computer
vision, machine learning and deep learning, statistics, and human-computer interaction. The video analysis tools developed
in this project will enable the following for cataract surgery, one of the most common surgical procedures in the U.S. and
across the world: 1) objective assessments of surgeons’ skill; 2) provide surgeons with specific feedback on how to improve
that is personalized given their past performance; and 3) preliminary evidence of effectiveness of a personalized learning
platform for surgeons’ skill acquisition. The anticipated impact of our work is to create a pathway in which the surgeon is
incentivized to see themselves and their performance as part of the process of improving outcomes and value in care, and
institutions have access to objective tools to create reproducible standards for surgical competency."
10925294,"Project Summary / Abstract 
Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are the output neurons of the retina responsible for transmitting information about the visual world from the eye to the brain. Thus, RGC damage and loss, a characteristic of many disorders of the visual system, has the direct consequence of vision impairment, or blindness when RGC loss is more severe. Our translation-enabling approach builds on a very well-established, thoroughly characterized and validated experimental glaucoma (EG) model. This affords our study the distinct advantage of conducting each of the proposed hypothesis-driven experiments within the framework of a reliable model of RGC degeneration that closely recapitulates the anatomical changes and pathophysiological processes observed in human glaucoma. Moreover, our preliminary results establish the feasibility of our approach, demonstrating that we have already achieved successful transplantation of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived RGCs into the EG retina, while also characterizing major barriers that require targeted solutions. Hence, we propose to employ a series of manipulations to both donor RGCs and the recipient EG retina in order to overcome the existing barriers to RGC replacement and thus make a giant leap forward toward realization of the audacious goal to restore vision in persons blinded by glaucoma or other optic neuropathies. Each of our Aims is soundly based on existing knowledge of the relevant biology and will lead to meaningful enhancement of donor RGC survival, integration, and function in the glaucomatous EG retina. We will utilize rigorous quantitative electrophysiological and anatomical assessments for testing the hypothesis at the core of each Aim. Aim 1 will target neuroinflammation to improve the long-term survival of transplanted RGCs. We will create hypoimmunogenic iPSCs and manipulate the host retinal environment using systemic immunosuppressive agents or inhibition of microglial activation. Aim 2 will augment donor cell survival and integration through modulation of cellular age, with host retinal glia experimentally induced to an immature state through cellular rejuvenation. Aim 3 will enhance the connectivity and axon outgrowth of donor RGCs in the retina. Donor RGCs will be edited to express hM3Dq DREADD receptors for chemogenetic stimulation and mTOR activators. Thrombospondin will be overexpressed in host retinal astrocytes and donor RGCs, leveraging astrocyte-derived factors that promote axonal outgrowth and synaptogenesis. Together, these Aims will generate a wealth of knowledge and resources for the scientific community and bring us significantly closer to the reality of vision restoration through RGC replacement."
10890003,"Project Summary
 Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons degenerate after functional decline in glaucoma, a circumstance potentially caused,
but certainly exacerbated by, energy deficit, indicating that metabolic dysfunction contributes to glaucomatous
degeneration. High intraocular pressure (IOP) in glaucoma results in hypoxia that promotes glycolysis through
upregulation of glycolysis-associated genes, but also mitochondrial recycling, and downregulation of genes encoding for
oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). A critical question is whether RGC metabolic reprogramming from OxPhos to
glycolysis is initiated by IOP-associated hypoxia, and whether repeated reprogramming and development of
pseudohypoxia underlies the significant energy stress and dysfunction observed in the glaucomatous retina.
 The long-term goal of this work is to leverage our understanding of retinal metabolism to maintain visual function
despite the stressors inherent in glaucomatous neurodegeneration. The overall objective of this proposal is to determine
the impact of IOP-mediated damage on retinal and optic nerve head metabolic resilience. Our central hypothesis is that
ocular hypertension (OHT)-associated hypoxia transitions into pseudohypoxia, destabilizing neural and glial metabolism
and mitochondrial homeostasis, with downstream negative impact on RGCs in the retina and ONH. This hypothesis
derives from our recent analysis indicating that mitochondria and availability of energy substrates, both targets of
hypoxia-associated regulation, contribute to the metabolic challenges of RGCs. The rationale for the work is that
investigating metabolic cooperation and dysfunction in glaucomatous retina will identify new therapeutic targets for a
disease that has no mechanism-based interventions.
 Guided by strong preliminary data, the aims of this proposal will address a critical element of the retinal energy
management in glaucoma by revealing 1) whether OHT is the impetus for metabolic reprogramming, followed by
adaptation as pseudohypoxia, in the glaucomatous retina; 2) how metabolic coupling is managed among neurons and
glia in the normal and ocular hypertensive retina; 3) how RGCs, Müller glia, and ONH astrocytes respond to and manage
metabolic challenge on a cell-by-cell basis. Overall, this work will enable us to determine how RGCs, Müller glia, and
ONH astrocytes respond metabolically to IOP increase, whether those changes persist long-term, and how we might
promote metabolic resilience. The approach is innovative by taking the position that insight will only come from
investigating the metabolic dependencies of the primary cell types impacted during the development of glaucoma
pathology. In addition, we will apply new cutting-edge approaches to the investigation of mitochondria such as cell-
specific mitochondrial isolation followed by metabolomics and co-detection of protein and gene expression through
spatial transcriptomics. This proposal is significant because we will reveal mitochondrial-specific metabolic dysregulation
amenable to therapeutic intervention."

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that there are over a billion people across the globe who
suffer from disabilities, with injuries and trauma listed as among the leading causes of disability. Most of them
reside in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Southeast Asia has one of the highest burdens of both
trauma and injuries, and related disabilities (Murray 2013). In Vietnam, while mortality due to injuries has
declined since 2008, the incidence of injuries has been increasing, which has led to significant increases in
Years Lived with Disabilities (YLDs) for most injuries (Nguyen 2020). Addressing this growing burden of post-
injury disabilities and the need for rehabilitation is a key priority area for the government of Vietnam. However,
in Vietnam and across Southeast Asia, there is limited local capacity for conducting research on the
consequences of injuries and post-injury rehabilitation, which would inform national policy and programmatic
responses. The absence of comprehensive training programs in the science of disability and rehabilitation, and
the social and economic impact within the larger public health sector in Vietnam, create a serious impediment
to analytic work in this field. This proposal offers a plan to address the growing need for understanding and
tackling the consequences of injuries and post-injury rehabilitation in Vietnam. The proposed 2021-2026
Johns Hopkins University-Hanoi University of Public Health Research Program on Health, Economic
and Societal consequences of trauma and injuries in Vietnam (JHU-Hanoi HEalS) will build on a strong
existing partnership between JHU and HUPH. Through this proposed program, we will build on existing
research and collaborations between our teams at JHU and HUPH in the larger field of health research and
public health from recent years. The overall goal of the Johns Hopkins University-Hanoi University of Public
Health Research Program on Health, Economic and Societal consequences of trauma and injuries in Vietnam
(JHU-Hanoi HEalS) is to strengthen research capacity to generate data and interventions to address the
rehabilitation needs of individuals post-injury and trauma in Vietnam, as well as the long term health,
economic, and societal consequences of trauma and injuries. Our approach will be based on close
collaboration between two institutions – Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health (JHU),
USA, and Hanoi University of Public Health (HUPH), Vietnam – each with a great commitment to
understanding the public health impact of trauma and injuries, experience and expertise in research and a
history of collaborative work. Our model will focus on using US expertise to strengthen the Vietnamese
institution, promote a sustainable research enterprise focused on injuries and trauma and their consequences,
leadership, national policy dialogue, and international linkages to Vietnam."
10692677,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The 2017 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Breastfeeding Report Card reported that
despite a high breastfeeding (BF) initiation of approximately 80% among the Hispanic population in the United
States (US), less than 25% of infants were exclusively breastfed (EBF) through 6 months, further perpetuating
ethnic disparities in chronic diseases such as diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. Hispanic women are more
likely to supplement feeding with formula, than non-Hispanic or African American (AA) mothers. Research has
reported that barriers such as insufficient BF education, lack of BF technical support (i.e. latching issues, sore
nipples), returning to work, easy access to free or discounted formula milk from Women Infants and Children
(WIC), lack of social support, perceived inconvenience, cultural belief that both formula and breastmilk (los-
dos) is best for the babies, perception that the infant is not satiated, and embarrassment associated with
breastfeeding result in premature weaning off BF among low-income Hispanic mothers. Therefore, increasing
the duration of EBF and continuous BF among low-income Hispanic women would require an innovative and
comprehensive approach that addresses the diverse range of barriers listed above. The proposed Fast-track
proposal titled Multi-modal Intervention for Lactation Care (MILC) will be a mHealth platform that consists of
the following innovative components: 1) Chat bot system to provide virtual peer counselor support; 2) Use of
escalating magnitude of incentives contingent on remotely observed breastfeeding; 3) Asynchronous and
synchronous communication tools to facilitate lactation and social support; and 4) Virtual peer mother to
mother support network. We propose the following aims for the Phase I:
1) Conduct formative research with a) low-income Hispanic mothers, b) Certified and international board-
certified lactation consultants (CLCs/IBCLCs) and c) in-depth Interviews (IDI)s with WIC staffs/primary care
providers (PCPs).
2) Conduct pilot testing of MILC prototype with 20 low-income Hispanic BF mothers who delivered their babies
at TUH and 5 CLC/IBCLCs working at TUH to demonstrate feasibility (usability and acceptance).
We propose the following aims for the Phase II:
1) Modify Phase I MILC prototype for commercialization and;
2) Conduct a randomized control trial (RCT) with 178 participants from TUH and Christiana Care Health
System (CCHS) and 20 CLCs/IBCLCs on MILC to assess MILC’s efficacy to significantly improve EBF rates at
6 months including increasing rates of any BF at month 1, month 3 and month 6.
In the long term, the impact of MILC will increase the rates of EBF up to 6 months along with increasing rates
of any BF up to 12 months."
10908601,"Insertable Cardiac Monitor-Guided Early Intervention to Reduce Atrial Fibrillation Burden Following
Catheter Ablation (ICM-REDUCE-AF Trial)
PI: Ilan Goldenberg, MD, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY
 Percutaneous catheter ablation (CA) to achieve pulmonary vein electrical isolation is an effective and
recommended treatment for drug-refractory paroxysmal and persistent atrial fibrillation (AF). Nevertheless,
recurrence rates after a single AF ablation procedure are in the range of 30%-50%. Accordingly, more measures
are needed to improve success rates following CA of AF.
 To date, conventional management after CA ablation has mostly been based on intervention for clinical
AF recurrence. Continuous recording with insertable cardiac monitors (ICMs) can now be used to detect early
recurrences of subclinical AF (SCAF) and patients-triggered mobile app transmissions post ablation. We
hypothesize that early intervention following CA can prevent substrate progression that promotes the onset and
maintenance of atrial arrhythmias. We therefore propose a randomized, double-blind (to SCAF data), single
center, clinical trial in which 120 patients with drug-refractory paroxysmal AF or persistent AF planned to undergo
CA with an ICM, will be randomized to: an intervention arm (n=60) consisting of ICM-guided early intervention
based on SCAF and patient-triggered mobile app transmissions vs. a control arm (n=60) consisting of a standard
intervention protocol based on clinical AF recurrence validated by the ICM. We believe that ICM-guided early
intervention management provides a novel personalized approach and a paradigm shift in post-AF ablation
management that will result in a significant reduction in AF burden and healthcare utilization in this expanding
population, with corresponding improvements in functional capacity and quality of life, compared with
conventional follow-up after AF ablation.
 In the proposed clinical trial, Aim 1 is to evaluate whether ICM-guided early intervention based on SCAF
detection and symptom-triggered mobile app transmissions will be associated with a significant reduction in AF
burden following CA for AF compared with the standard strategy of treatment upon the development of clinical
AF recurrence. AF burden will be assessed from ICMs at 15 months post-AF ablation (excluding the 3-month
blanking period). Aim 2 is to evaluate whether ICM-guided early intervention management will be associated
with a reduction in in healthcare utilization (defined as unplanned hospitalizations, emergency department visits,
cardioversions, and unplanned office visits) compared with a conventional management strategy. Aim 3 is to
evaluate whether ICM-guided early intervention management will be associated with improvement in functional
capacity and quality of life compared with a conventional management strategy following CA for AF."

10912591,"Project Summary
Chronic pain is an enormous public health problem, and African American older adults bear a disproportionate
burden of disabling pain. Evidence-based chronic pain self-management support can improve pain-related
functioning, yet standard models for providing this support are not well-suited to reach older people in
communities of color such as Detroit, Michigan, which face severe racial segregation and socioeconomic
disadvantage. Existing pain self-management interventions are mostly group-based and require in-person
contact, making them less accessible to older adults with transportation or mobility barriers. Moreover, existing
interventions seldom address the social determinants of health (e.g., economic stressors) that are rooted in the
same structural inequities that produce high rates of pain and hinder its management. The long-term goal of
this line of research is to build a robust evidence base for chronic pain self-management interventions that
meet the needs of vulnerable older adults in underserved communities. The objective of this proposed project
is to determine whether community health workers (CHWs)—i.e., lay health workers with close ties to the
communities they serve – can effectively teach cognitive-behavioral pain management strategies to older
adults in a disadvantaged urban setting. CHWs are uniquely suited for this role, given their ability to provide
culturally appropriate care and their deep knowledge of community resources that enables them to address
social determinants of health. The central hypothesis is that a CBT-based pain self-management intervention
(“STEPS”) delivered over 7 weeks through telephone sessions with a CHW and mobile health tools improves
one-year pain-related outcomes. Our highly encouraging preliminary findings indicate that STEPS is feasible,
deliverable by CHWs with high fidelity, and well-received by participants (n=31). Its potential efficacy is
suggested by significant improvement in pain interference (pre-post Standardized Mean Difference = 0.84, p =
000). The proposed trial will take place in partnership with the Detroit-based Henry Ford Health System. There
are three specific aims: 1) Conduct a Stage 3 efficacy trial to assess whether STEPS can reduce one-year pain
interference and intensity among 414 primarily African American older adults, 2) Assess psychobehavioral
mediators and moderators of intervention effects, and 3) Using qualitative data from participants and other
stakeholders, conduct mixed-methods analysis to provide context for quantitative findings and inform a toolkit
for dissemination, if the intervention is effective. This project is innovative in that it enlists CHWs, who have
delivered evidence-based interventions for other conditions but are not yet part of the pain care workforce. It
has strong potential impact given that the model being tested is low-cost, scalable, and suitable for deeply
disadvantaged settings, where the burden of chronic pain is greatest. Moreover, it can be delivered remotely,
which not only maximizes access but is compatible with social distancing. Ultimately, this research could lead
to a transferable model that can be applied to other vulnerable populations in need of improved pain care."

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common cancer among men and women in the U.S., leading to
over 50,000 deaths per year. Research aimed at reducing CRC’s high burden, discovering/validating novel
biomarkers associated with prognosis, addressing the growing epidemic of early-onset CRC, and countering
CRC disparities in underserved populations is of pressing importance. CRC patient cohorts that include diverse
populations and longitudinally ascertain clinical data and biospecimens are essential for pursuing these critical
objectives. The ColoCare Study is a large, multi-institutional prospective survivorship cohort that enrolls newly
diagnosed patients with CRC from diverse racial/ethnic and geographic backgrounds. CRC survivorship
cohorts are rare and ColoCare is unique given its collection of detailed epidemiologic and clinical data and a
variety of biospecimens at multiple time points. This design enables innovative survivorship research that
spans lifestyle/behavioral factors, racial/ethnic CRC disparities, and translational studies aimed at discovering
and validating novel molecular, blood- and microbiome-based biomarkers related to the risk of adverse CRC
outcomes. Such research can inform treatment decision-making, interventions aimed at improving key clinical
and patient reported outcomes, and the development of novel therapeutics.
 The ColoCare Study has enrolled >3,000 patients with a median of 2.1 years of follow-up and biospecimen
collections including tumor tissue and serial blood, stool, and urine samples. Despite being a young cohort,
ColoCare has already supported 70 published papers and 79 projects that include 72 external investigators.
Continued U01 infrastructure support is critical to sustain and grow this valuable resource for CRC survivorship
research. Here, we will pursue the following aims: (1) Increase the size of the cohort from 3,361 to 4,157
participants, including enhanced recruitment of underserved and understudied populations who experience
significant disparities in CRC outcomes, and patients receiving novel therapies. (2) Extend participant follow-up
to 5-years through both active follow-up (biospecimens; questionnaires; medical record abstractions) and
passive follow-up (SEER/state cancer registries and National Death Index). (3) Maintain and expand the
ColoCare biorepository, including collection of tumor tissue samples and longitudinal collections of blood and
stool samples. (4) Maintain and expand the ColoCare Central Data Warehouse, the capabilities of our study
portal to encourage and facilitate requests from external and internal investigators, and engagement with our
Community Advisory Board to advance patient participation and the public dissemination of knowledge
generated by ColoCare. With continued infrastructure support, this unique and comprehensive resource will
continue to enable a wide-range of impactful colorectal cancer survivorship research."
10903796,"Project Summary
Microsatellite instablility (MSI), a class of genetic hypermutability arising from impaired DNA
mismatch repair, contributes to development to types of cancers. While immune checkpoint
blockade (ICB) is effective for some patients, 45-60% of patients do not response to ICB and the
use of these agents can be limited by their toxicity and/or acquired resistance. The pressing need
for further therapies against this large class of cancers inspired our efforts identifying the RecQ
helicase WRN as a synthetic lethal target for MSI cancers. This discovery raises fundamental
questions about how WRN functions to protect the MSI cancers from DNA double strand breaks
and what is the best strategy to implement WRN inhibition to treat MSI cancers. This project seeks
to address these questions by first testing our hypothesis that WRN is required to unwind
secondary DNA structures that are specifically enriched in MSI cells (Aim 1). Furthermore, we will
explore the structure/function relationship of WRN in the context of MSI with a goal of identifying
essential regions to inform drug discovery efforts (Aim 2). Our preliminary data also demonstrated
that WRN inhibition induces a TNFα transcriptional response in MSI cells. These results inspired
our hypothesis that the DNA damage following WRN depletion triggers an innate immune
response in MSI cancers (Aim 3). By integrating functional genomics, biochemical techniques,
DNA repair biology, and in vivo modeling, we seek to define the mechanism underlying the
dependence upon WRN in MSI cells for survival, facilitate rational design of WRN inhibitors, and
promote development of new combination therapies for MSI cancers.
I am a medical oncologist with a background in functional genomics and DNA repair biology. My
long-term goal as a physician-scientist is to lead a basic/translational laboratory studying how
cancers tolerate impaired DNA repair pathways and the vulnerabilities that arise in this context. I
will be primarily mentored by Dr. Adam Bass at the Broad Institute and Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute. Furthermore, my scientific advisory committee composed of Drs. Alan D’Andrea,
Raymond Monnat, Matthew Meyerson, and David Barbie will help guide my scientific and career
development. Coupled with collaborations with Drs. Andre Nussenzweig and Tyler Jacks, a
focused training and career developmental plan, the proposed training plan will help me build the
momentum to launch my career as an independent investigator."
10914033,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most common hematological malignancy and is largely incurable. Black
Americans experience an unexplained 2-fold excess risk compared to White Americans, while Asian Americans
experience a lower risk. MM is preceded by a precursor state characterized by an accumulation of benign
monoclonal plasma cells that secrete a monoclonal protein (monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined
significance, MGUS), which occurs with the same racial/ethnic disparity as seen in MM. Thus, explaining the
causes of the disparity in MGUS will shed light on the causes of the disparity in MM. We (MPIs Cozen, Desai
and Bertrand) are submitting this proposal in response to PAR 19-279, MMDPQ1: “What risk factors, singularly
or in cooperation, explain the variation in MGUS incidence among different races?” Our central hypothesis is
that racial and ethnic differences in plasma cell growth/angiogenic factors, microbial translocation, chronic
antigenic stimulation due to previous infection and lifestyle factors can explain the observed MGUS incidence
disparity. By screening participants in 4 multiethnic NCI epidemiology cohorts (Black Women's Health Study,
Women's Health Initiative, Multiethnic Cohort, Southern Community Cohort Study), we will identify 844 Blacks,
844 Non-Latino Whites, 146 Latino and 146 Asians with laboratory validated MGUS and an equal number of
age-, sex- race/ethnicity- matched controls without MGUS by the same laboratory screening. We will measure
levels of 18 biomarkers reflecting plasma cell growth, angiogenesis, inflammation and microbial translocation
(IL6, IL17, XCL13, IL6-R, BAFF, APRIL, gp130, HGF, CCL-8, Angioprotein-2, LBP, sCD14, adiponectin, BCMA,
IP-10, IL10, MIP1-a, CXCL12) (Aim 1). We will also examine exposures associated with B-cell activation
including lifetime cumulative infection from chronic immune stimulating agents by measuring antibodies
simultaneously in a multiplex system to Hepatitis B and C viruses, H. pylori, T. gondii, T. pallidum, C. trachomatis,
HPV, and all 8 Herpes family viruses (Aim 2), and lifestyle factors obesity, physical activity, diabetes and use of
anti-inflammatory medications metformin, statins and aspirin, known to affect B-cell response (Aim 3). To
determine whether a given putative risk factor can (at least partly) explain the racial disparities in MGUS we will
(1) determine whether the factor is consistently related to MGUS within all four ethnic groups and if so then; (2)
estimate the strength of the relationship in a combined analysis and; (3) determine whether the prevalence of an
MGUS-associated factor differs by race in a direction consistent with the known racial differences in MGUS risk.
We will use logistic regression techniques that relate either continuous or binary factors (body mass index,
diabetes, individual infections) to the log odds of MGUS. With our multidisciplinary team of co-investigators and
collaboration of 4 racially/ethnically diverse cancer epidemiology cohorts, we are uniquely positioned to be able
to identify causes of the MGUS disparity, about which there is little known. This study will provide critical
information on the knowledge gap that exists in the causes of racial/ethnic disparity for MGUS."

1 The Mirarab laboratory designs leading computational methods for answering biological and biomedical ques-
2 tions, focusing on scalability and accuracy. These methods span several areas (e.g., microbiome proﬁling,
3 multiple sequence alignment, and phylogenomics), and a common thread among them is evolutionary mod-
4 eling. The lab has developed scalable and accurate methods for reconstructing evolutionary histories (i.e.,
 5 phylogenies) and using these histories in downstream biomedical applications. Reconstructing phylogenies is a
 6 fundamental goal and a precursor to many biological analyses. Methods developed by this lab (e.g., ASTRAL)
7 are at the forefronts of modern genome-wide phylogenetics. Moreover, biomedical research increasingly uses
8 evolutionary histories in diverse areas like microbiome analyses, immunology, epidemiology, and comparative
9 genomics. While the lab has previously focused more on inferring species histories, it has recently started
10 to shift its focus to developing methods for microbiome analyses. The inference and the use of evolutionary
11 histories in analyzing environmental microbiome samples present a unique set of challenges.
12 In the next ﬁve years, the Mirarab lab will focus on designing, testing, and applying improved methods for
13 statistical analyses of microbiome data. These methods will target two questions. (i) Proﬁling: What organisms
14 constitute a given sample? (ii) Association: How are samples different in their organismal composition, and
15 how do these differences connect to measurable characteristics of their environment? While both questions
16 have been subject to considerable research, many computational challenges remain, providing an opportunity
17 for better methods to make a signiﬁcant impact. Instead of focusing solely on new algorithms, the lab will
18 also work on building better reference datasets and combining data from multiple sources. Thus, the project
19 aims to harness the unprecedented computational power, large available datasets, and recent advances in
20 machine learning to improve state-of-the-art dramatically. The project will not use off-the-shelf machine learning
21 methods in a black-box fashion. Instead, it develops methods that incorporate biological knowledge (e.g., of the
22 evolutionary relationships) into machine learning methods in a principled biologically-motivated fashion.
23 The lab will pursue several ambitious goals for both proﬁling and association questions. The project will
24 (i) create methods to infer a continuously-updated reference alignment and tree encompassing all sequenced
25 prokaryotic genomes (half a million currently) to be used for proﬁling, (ii) build methods for ultra-sensitive sam-
26 ple proﬁling, (iii) use deep learning to connect data obtained using amplicon sequencing and metagenomics,
27 (iv) build discordance-aware phylogenetic measures of sample differentiation, and (v) develop machine learning
28 methods for associating a proﬁled microbiome to phenotypes of interest such as disease. These new methods
29 will draw on statistics, machine learning, discrete optimization, and high-performance computing. Consistent
30 with the goals of MIRA, the project may explore new unforeseen opportunities if they ﬁt its general goals."

Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a common disorder whose etiology remains unclear and likely
multifactorial. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), fail to fully reduce the burden of disease, highlighting need
for additional studies into the pathogenesis of MDD. Alterations in gut microbiota composition (termed
“dysbiosis”) leading to altered signaling along the route of communication between the gut and the brain
(termed the gut -microbiota- brain axis) represents a novel modifiable target associated with MDD. While
several studies have linked dysbiosis to MDD, our understanding of how these changes contribute to altered
signaling along this gut-microbiota-brain axis and depressive symptoms remains limited.
This proposal aims to determine how changes in the activity of an understudied pathway of tryptophan
metabolism (the indole pathway) by the gut microbiota contributes to the pathophysiology of MDD. Using stool
and blood samples from a well characterized cohort of unmedicated MDD subjects along with healthy controls
and samples from these same unmedicated subjects after 8 weeks of antidepressant treatment, the candidate
will address two aims. First, using a shotgun metagenomics approach, changes in the capacity of the gut
microbiota to produce metabolites of the indole pathway associated with MDD will be assessed. This will be
related to changes in serum levels of indoles, activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, and the ability to
modulate the activity of microglia. Next, these parameters will be assessed after antidepressant treatment to
identify changes associated with successful treatment. This study is novel given its use of unmedicated, well
characterized MDD subjects and our assessment of gut microbiome community structure/function within the
same individual after treatment (which has never been done previously). The candidate will leverage a number
of approaches including 1) metagenomics 2) metabolomics 3) in vitro assays and 4) bacterial genetics to
interrogate mechanisms of gut-brain axis signaling involved in the pathophysiology of MDD.
This proposal presents a five-year research career development program designed to provide a foundation for
future research endeavors as an independent physician -investigator researcher. The candidate is currently a
Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Fellow (in a three-year research fellowship) at UCSF. This proposal builds on
the candidate's previous experience studying host-pathogen interactions and the role of Lactobacillus species
in health and disease. This proposal will integrate new domains of expertise by his mentors, including the study
of the role of dysbiosis of complex microbial communities in the etiology of disease, neurodevelopment and the
neurobiological basis of depression, and design/implementation of clinical studies by his mentors, Dr.
Wolkowitz, Dr. Mellon, and Dr. Lynch. These skills fill critical gaps in the candidate's knowledge and the plan
outlined here will provide the candidate with a unique set of skills enabling him to transition to an independent
research career focused on gut-microbiota-brain axis signaling in neuropsychiatric disease."
10913487,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The overall goal of this problem-driven research is to provide a proof-of-concept strategy for implementing a
nonlinear membrane based analysis for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) rupture risk assessment that
overcomes the scientific and technological limitations of a finite element analysis (FEA)-based approach. To this
end, we propose to develop and apply a method for quantifying rupture potential index (RPI) that does not require
knowledge of the tissue properties of the AAA wall and intraluminal thrombus, nor does it need an estimation of
the unstressed AAA shape or residual stresses, and does not require an FEA solver. The proposed method is
based on nonlinear elastic membrane analysis (NEMA) theory, informed by our prior body of work on geometry
quantification of patient-specific AAA models. Therefore, it is a physics-driven method for RPI quantification. We
also propose to apply the method while conducting a prospective human subjects research study and assess its
potential for rupture risk assessment based on its ability to predict future growth rates. We hypothesize that the
new method for calculating RPI will be able to predict future AAA growth rate with a minimum probability of 80%.
We will complete the following Specific Aims to accomplish the aforementioned goal and test the proposed
hypothesis: (I) Develop a non-FEA approach for calculating RPI; (II) Calculate individual RPI and growth rate for
AAAs under surveillance; and (III) Perform a predictive analysis of future AAA growth based on current RPI. The
primary expected outcome of this research is a physics-driven method for predicting future AAA growth by
calculating RPI using current, standard of care abdominal CT images. The method is devoid of the limitations
that characterize typical biomechanics-based approaches. If proven successful, this approach could be
envisioned as part of a computational tool for rupture risk assessment in the clinic."
10933400,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Nuclear hormone receptors (NRs) are among the most widely targeted proteins in malignancy as they drive a
number of common cancers. Hormones directly bind to NRs, leading to downstream transcriptional signaling.
Some of the most common cancers (breast and prostate) are a result of aberrant NR signaling (estrogen and
androgen receptor, respectively), and are treated using NR-targeting drugs like selective estrogen receptor
modulators (SERMs) and degraders (SERDs). Other NRs, including glucocorticoid and thyroid receptors, are
targeted in other diseases. Still others are orphan receptors or have yet to be therapeutically targeted.
 My research focuses on an important yet unanswered aspect of NR biology. It is known that hormone
binding to NRs leads to transcriptional activation, followed by NR protein degradation. NR degradation regulates
its transcriptional activity, but the mechanism of NR degradation and its effects on NR signaling remains not well
characterized and is a central question in the field of NR biology. Understanding this phenomenon is clinically
important: widely prescribed drugs for breast and prostate cancer work via binding and degrading specific NRs.
I have recently discovered that, after hormone binding to NRs, the HECT E3 ubiquitin ligase UBR5 binds to and
degrades NRs. Importantly, I found that multiple NRs are degraded by UBR5, delineating a common degradation
mechanism of at least a large subset of NRs. We discovered that UBR5 regulates NRs following ligand activation
by binding to the same site as nuclear co-activators (NCOA), which facilitate NR induced transcription, resulting
in direct competition on chromatin. UBR5 therefore is not only a regulator of NR protein stability, but of
transcription. However, we and others have observed that NRs can undergo ligand induced degradation without
ligand induced activation, implying that NRs discriminate between NCOA and UBR5 binding; characterization
and control of these interactions would lead to a specific induction of NR activation or degradation (or both),
leading to significant therapeutic control over physiologic or disease processes reliant on hormone signaling.
 My goal is to characterize UBR5's role as a transcriptional regulator by direct degradation on chromatin
and by doing so, enable an understanding of the pathways of nuclear hormone activation and degradation. If
successful, this may enable the rational design of hormone derivatives that can decouple NR activation and
degradation, allowing for control over hormone receptor signaling. The research proposed here also will yield
basic insight into chromatin and transcriptional regulation, and ubiquitin E3 ligase biology. To achieve this long-
term goal, we must first develop: a characterization of the biochemical interactions between UBR5 and its NR
substrates (Aim 1), a better understanding of UBR5's regulatory capabilities over NR transcriptional activities
(Aim 2), and a broader characterization of small molecule hormone derivatives that lead to NR activation,
degradation, or both (Aim 3). These aims form parallel lines of investigation that seeks to establish E3 ligases
as transcriptional regulators and create a platform for rational drug design of hormone derivatives."
10892150,"The environmental sensor, aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) serves as a ligand for pollutants as well as
for plant, microbial and endogenous compounds. Following AhR ligation, the activated AhR regulates gene
expression through the binding of AhR/ARNT complex to specific DNA motifs known as Dioxin Response
Elements (DREs). Studies from our lab and elsewhere have shown that some AhR ligands have potent
immunosuppressive properties. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) results from chronic inflammation in the
gastrointestinal tract that affects 1.5 million people in the US. The pathogenesis of IBD involves complex
interactions between gut microbiota, immune response, environmental and dietary factors, and
genetic/epigenetic regulation. Recently, we made an exciting observation that the AhR ligand and plant product,
I3C ameliorates colitis in mice, which was associated with anti-inflammatory effects, regulation of gut dysbiosis,
and enhanced expression of β-defensins (mBD1,2,3) by Colonic Epithelial Cells (CEC). β-defensins constitute
antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) that resist microbial colonization of epithelial surfaces in the colonic tissue. β-
defensins may also mediate anti-inflammatory effects. In fact, studies have shown defective expression of
intestinal AMPs particularly defensins in IBD patients. We were excited to uncover DREs in the promoters of
mouse β-defensins (mBD1, 2, and 3). In the current study, we will test the central hypothesis that dietary indoles
(I3C) attenuate colitis through AhR activation leading to increased expression of mBDs by CECs via pathways
involving DREs, and/or epigenetic regulation resulting in modulation of microbiota and prevention of epithelial
barrier damage. Furthermore, we propose that mBDs induced by I3C play a critical role in restoring healthy gut
microbiota, preventing intestinal barrier damage and suppressing colonic inflammation through induction of
Tregs. Aim 1 will test the mechanisms of mBD induction by dietary indoles. We will use reporter assay, promoter
bashing and electrophoretic mobility shift assay to determine whether I3C activated AhR directly binds to the
DREs to induce mBDs. We will also determine the effect of I3C on the mBD expression by using AhR cKO mice
with AhR deletion in IEC, ILC3 and Tregs. In Aim 2, we will study epigenetic regulation of β-defensins by dietary
indoles. To that end, we will test whether I3C regulates mBD expression by altering histone modification and
decreasing DNA methylation. We will specifically determine if I3C regulates the SATB1-mediated histone
deacetylation and chromatin remodeling. In Aim 3, we will test whether administration of mBDs offers protection
from colitis by regulating gut dysbiosis, preventing CEC barrier damage, enhancing Treg subsets and decreasing
Th17 subpopulations to attenuate colonic inflammation. Finally, we will use mBD KO mice to test whether mBDs
are required for I3C-mediated protection from colitis. The proposed studies are highly significant because they
will identify novel mechanisms through which dietary indoles suppress colitis by altering the microbiota, through
activation of AhR leading to increased expression of host-derived AMPs, specifically β-defensins."

Accumulating evidence supports the involvement of circadian rhythm dysfunction in bipolar disorder (BD). There
is currently a critical need for identifying the neuropathological correlates of circadian dysfunction in human
subjects with BD, and linking these correlates to functional consequences. We focus on the suprachiasmatic
nucleus (SCN), the master clock of mammalian organisms, and its major output area the paraventricular nucleus
(PVN), a region critically involved in the regulation of stress and anxiety. Our preliminary data showing decreased
expression of somatostatin and the clock protein period 2 in the SCN indicate impaired SCN molecular clock
rhythms in BD. Furthermore, decreased period 2 along with increased expression of the stress signaling
molecule corticotropin releasing factor in the PVN during the morning in subjects with bipolar disorder suggests
that weaker SCN rhythms impact downstream stress signaling, coinciding with the established increase in
severity of anxiety and depression and increased cortisol at this time of day. Studies in nocturnal rodents have
provided insight into how the SCN and PVN are involved in regulating stress and mood, suggesting that disrupted
SCN molecular clock rhythms can alter expression rhythms of clock molecules and stress response molecules
in regions involved in mood regulation. Our preliminary evidence suggesting weakened molecular clock rhythms
in the SCN of subjects with BD supports this hypothesis. There is currently a lack of information regarding the
cell specific expression rhythms of neuropeptides and clock molecules, and their association with stress
response molecules in these regions in humans. The proposed studies will establish the foundation necessary
to test our overarching hypothesis that altered molecular clock rhythms in the SCN in BD are associated with
altered clock rhythms and increased expression of stress response molecules in downstream regions involved
in stress response and mood regulation. We will test the hypotheses that i) expression of clock molecules,
neuropeptides, and corticotropin releasing factor follow diurnal rhythms of expression in the human SCN and
PVN ii) SCN and PVN molecular rhythms are disrupted in subjects with BD, associated with altered expression
of molecules implicated in genome wide association studies."
10929314,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a serious skeletal complication that affects 30% of people living
with sickle cell disease (SCD). ONFH causes severe chronic pain and permanent disability. ONFH
symptoms persist even after curative hematopoietic stem cell transplant therapy, with post-transplant patients
reporting poorer quality of life due to their skeletal limitations. There is an urgent need to explore effective
therapies for ONFH to relieve pain and improve the health-related quality of life for people with SCD. Alendronate,
an oral bisphosphonate that is FDA-approved for treatment of osteoporosis, decreased bone pain and delayed
the time to femoral head collapse in people with steroid-induced and traumatic ONFH. The therapeutic potential
of alendronate to alleviate bone pain in adults with SCD-related ONFH is an important gap in knowledge with
far-reaching public health implications.
My colleagues and I recently showed that low bone density, another prevalent skeletal complication of SCD,
associates with ONFH and chronic pain in children and adolescents with SCD. I speculate that the association
between low bone density, ONFH and sickle cell pain will be even more significant in adults since many SCD
complications worsen with age. In this K23 resubmission, I plan to study the pain phenotype of adults with SCD
and low bone density using a validated patient-reported outcome measure. I will also conduct a single-arm 6-
month feasibility study of alendronate in a prospective cohort of 24 adults with SCD-related ONFH. The primary
endpoints are predetermined recruitment and retention rates. Secondary endpoints include preliminary safety
and efficacy, as measured by adverse events reporting, medication adherence, opioid use, change in pain scores
and other surrogate markers. Lastly, I will collect serum and urine specimens from a subset of non-transfused
study subjects to better understand how bone biomarkers can be used a proxy for alendronate adherence and
to study how bone biomarker concentrations correlate with underlying SCD bone pathobiology.
Repurposing alendronate as targeted therapy for SCD-related ONFH can reduce opioid use and improve
health-related quality of life for people with SCD. This revised K23 proposal will lay the groundwork for a
subsequent R01 application for a Phase 2 multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of alendronate
in adults with SCD complicated by ONFH. My work will significantly add to ongoing clinical-translational
studies to reduce the burden of chronic pain in people living with SCD. The research and training program
detailed in my K23 application will provide me with the critical skills I need to build my career as an
independent, clinical investigator engaged in developing safe and effective therapies for people with SCD."
10909904,"Project Summary/Abstract
 The inability to maintain upright body posture and balance is one of the major motor disorders following
spinal cord injury (SCI). In our previous, NIH-supported studies, specific distortions in operation of spinal
postural mechanisms (networks) underlying each of three main phenomena related to SCI – spinal shock, the
development of spasticity, and the recovery of postural functions have been demonstrated in an animal model
(rabbit). We also demonstrated a crucial role of supraspinal postural networks in control of posture. A general
goal of the present project is to explain effects of SCI on postural functions on the basis of SCI-caused
changes in the operation of the corresponding supraspinal neuronal postural networks. Clinical data suggest
that most SCIs are incomplete. Incomplete SCIs cause severe distortions in the interaction between the brain
and the spinal cord. This leads to a dramatic decrease or asymmetry of muscle tone and postural limb reflexes
resulting in the inability to stand and maintain balance. Our Aim 1 is to analyze the effects of incomplete SCIs
(lateral and dorsal hemisection, LHS and DHS) on the operation of supraspinal postural networks, and to
explain postural deficits by the changes in the activity of specific ascending and descending pathways. We
have developed a novel technique that allows to perform “reversible LHS or DHS” repeatedly many times. This
allows studying postural responses and the activity of individual neurons of the ascending and descending
pathways under two conditions: (i) when the brain is connected to the spinal cord and (ii) during LHS or DHS,
when the connection between the spinal cord and the brain through lateral or dorsal pathways, respectively, is
temporarily blocked. Previously we have shown that, after DHS and LHS, postural functions recover in a few
weeks. Our Aim 2 is to analyze the activity of supraspinal postural networks in recovered LHS- and DHS-
subjects, and to explain the recovery by changes in the activity of specific populations of ascending and
descending neurons. For this purpose, we will (i) record the activity of individual neurons of the supraspinal
postural networks during postural performance in recovered LHS- and DHS-subjects, and (ii) compare the
results with those obtained in intact subjects and in subjects after acute LHS and DHS. Our Aim 3 is to analyze
the role of different descending pathways in control of specific aspects of postural behavior in recovered LHS-
and DHS-subjects, and to explain the recovery by the changes in the functional role of particular pathways. For
this purpose, the effects of the chemogenetic activation/inactivation of different supraspinal pathways on the
performance of various postural tasks in intact and recovered LHS- and DHS-subjects will be compared.
 This study will provide unique information about the SCI-caused changes in the activity of supraspinal
neuronal networks, which are responsible for the motor deficits, as well as about the changes underlying
functional recovery in subjects with incomplete SCI. This information is clinically relevant as a basis for
designing new rehabilitation strategies for recuperating postural functions in patients with postural deficits."

technologies to DC-IDDRC investigators in order to support, facilitate, and enhance IDD-targeted research in
humans and in animal models. To achieve the Core’s aims we have established advanced imaging facilities at
three collaborating DC-IDDRC institutions - Howard University (HU), Georgetown University (GU), and
Children’s National Hospital (CNH) - that provide structural and functional imaging of animal models and
human populations. The HAIC provides access to a wide array of imaging tools to investigate mechanisms of
disease, establish biomarkers, examine effects of disease, and monitor outcomes of interventions. We have
made significant institutional investments in 3T human MRI scanners at CNH, and GU that provide researchers
with state-of-the-art imaging instrumentation and expand our imaging capacity in neonates and ill children.
Furthermore, we have also invested in MRI scanner/software upgrades and added PET, SPECT, and CT to
the preclinical animal imaging facilities at HU. HAIC personnel provide technical expertise in imaging strategy
design, essential imaging services, acquisition and innovative imaging sequences and analysis methods
across all sites and institutions. Core faculty and staff also help educate, train, and support investigators in the
use of advanced neuroimaging methods, applications, and analysis software as well as foster innovation. The

10907694,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) in women taking oral contraceptives (OC) is a problem of broad clinical
significance that is mediated, at least in part, by estrogen effects on the expression of blood coagulation
proteins by the liver or vasculature. Our overall goal is to identify and characterize the underlying coagulation
pathways leading to OC-induced hypercoagulability and to identify genetic factors prevalent in individuals at
highest risk for VTE. OC use decreases the plasma concentration of two endogenous anticoagulant proteins,
tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) and protein S (PS) that modulate plasma FIXa production and activity.
We have developed a highly sensitive and specific (<10 pmol/L) technique for measurement of plasma FIXa
activity using an enhanced thrombin generation assay, which amplifies the FIXa signal from subject plasma via
thrombin generation in FIX-deficient plasma. Using this assay in plasma samples from blood donors we found
that OC-induced changes in TFPI and PS are associated with elevated plasma factor IXa (FIXa) activity in
~30% of women taking OC. Our central hypothesis is that OC use alters the inhibition of procoagulant
responses by the natural anticoagulants TFPI and PS, producing large increases in plasma factor IXa (FIXa)
activity and a systemic hypercoagulable state. This hypothesis will be probed to identify biochemical and
genetic correlates of OC-induced hypercoagulability. Biochemical studies using recombinant FIX variants
resistant to antithrombin or PS binding will be used to define how TFPI and PS modulate FIXa generation in
human plasma-based systems. The clinical impact of the biochemical findings will be examined by
measurement of plasma levels of TFPI, PS, and FIXa, GWAS analysis, and a thrombosis history questionnaire
in two cohorts of pre-menopausal women: 1) a cross-sectional cohort of ~1000 pre-menopausal blood donors;
and 2) a longitudinal cohort of ~45 adolescent girls to be followed for one year after initiation of OC-therapy.
The data collected in the cross-sectional cohort will be modeled to identify non-genetic and genetic factors that
correlate with OC-associated differences in plasma TFPI, PS and FIXa and thrombosis history. The data
collected in the longitudinal cohort will be used to examine the time course and stability of the OC-induced
plasma hypercoagulable state within individuals using repeated measures analysis. These findings will be used
to validate plasma protein changes and the effect of SNPs identified by GWAS in the cross-sectional cohorts.
The proposed experiments will define the biochemical and genetic underpinnings of the OC-induced hyper-
coaguable state focused on our finding of elevated amounts of an activated clotting factor, FIXa, in the plasma
of about 30% of women using OC. These results will also establish rationale for further clinical studies to define
the predictive value of plasma FIXa and associated genetic markers for OC-induced thrombosis and facilitate
evidence-based decision-making for women considering use of OC and related hormonal therapies."

This is a competitive renewal application for continuing support of a predoctoral training program at UC Davis
focused on research using Animal Models of Infectious Diseases (AMID). The AMID Training Program, launched
in 2004, takes advantage of the unique resources at UC Davis, where we have co-localized on one campus the
Graduate School, Schools of Medicine and Veterinary Medicine, the California National Primate Research
Center, the internationally renowned Mouse Biology Program, and the Center for Immunology and Infectious
Diseases— creating a unique training environment that arguably exists nowhere else in the world. During the
previous funding period, using this NIH grant and UC Davis matching support, we supported a group of 21
students who were mentored by 14 different faculty trainers, and included 11 (52%) women trainees, 3 students
in combined DVM/PhD or MD/PhD programs, and 6 (29%) trainees from URM groups. The success of the AMID
Program during the past funding period is best highlighted by the accomplishments of the 21 students, which
include authoring an average of 3.1 papers from their UC Davis graduate work (many in high impact journals,
including Nature, Science, and Cell Press), receiving predoctoral fellowships and awards, and advancing to
prestigious postdoctoral positions. Long-term success of the AMID program is also evident, as 8 of our past
trainees now have Assistant or Associate Professor positions at major research Universities and others have
equivalent leadership positions in industry. In addition, the AMID program has fueled collaborative research,
enhanced student mentorship, provided campus-enriching seminars, and resulted in research grants to several
participating faculty. This training program also spurred the development of several campus initiatives, including
an interdisciplinary graduate program (equivalent to a minor) called the Designated Emphasis in Host-Microbe
Interaction, two new graduate course offerings, enhanced pedagogy of responsible conduct of research, and
new initiatives to encourage URM applications to our graduate programs. We request continued support of four
predoctoral trainees per year, which will be supplemented by institutional funds to support three additional
trainees. This Training Program addresses a critical need and we expect continued success of the AMID
Program, with a large and diverse pool of prospective trainees; enthusiastic program directors; an expanded
group of training faculty that is increasingly accomplished and gender balanced; and a research community
operating in an ideal environment for studies on animal models of human infectious diseases."
10864062,"ABSTRACT
Chronic constipation (CC) is a common condition that affects up to 25% of the population in North America with
rising incidence that poses a major burden on the healthcare cost. The pathophysiology of this condition is
poorly understood and consequently there are inadequate treatments. The significant problems are, 1)
incomplete understanding of the defecation reflex and 2) lack of physiologically relevant and practical
diagnostic test for identifying the underlying mechanism(s). Current diagnostic tests provide incomplete and
often conflicting information. Not surprisingly, results of these tests correlate poorly with symptoms and
treatment outcomes. Our objective is to provide an improved understanding of the continence mechanisms
and defecation patterns in healthy subjects and patients with CC using a novel Fecobionics device for mapping
the geometric and manometric profiles during evacuation. Fecobionics is an electronic simulated stool that has
the consistency and shape of normal stool. The device records pressures, cross-sectional area, orientation,
bending, shape, and viscoelastic properties of the rectum and anal canal simultaneously. Our central
hypothesis is that rectal peristalsis is a key component of the defecatory reflex which is not assessed in the
current paradigm of diagnostic testing. The novel Fecobionics device will mimic the natural defecation and
provide new mechanistic insights into the anorectal physiology and pathophysiology to facilitate the
development of new treatments for CC. Fecobionics can provide complete picture of the normal defecation
pattern (“signatures”) that includes rectal peristaltic reflex, deformability of the device and distensibility of the
anal sphincters in healthy subjects and patients with various subtypes of CC. The Specific Aims are as
follows: 1) Study the defecation dynamics in normal control subjects using Fecobionics. We will establish the
role of rectal contraction/peristalsis in the normal evacuation process. 2) Define the defecatory patterns in
patients with CC associated with defecatory disorders. We will determine if abnormalities of rectal contraction
contribute to the CC. 3) Use a mathematical model of anorectal passage of Fecobionics for enhanced
understanding of the normal and abnormal defecatory patterns, including the length-tension properties of the
rectum and anal sphincter muscles. Our proposal seeks to shift current CC research by providing a stool
surrogate for examining the physiologic parameters of defecation reflex using a novel device that will record,
pressure, deformability, biomechanics, vectoral and topographic changes in the rectum and anal canal. The
noted parameters will be recorded using a wireless Fecobionics device that can examine in detail the
mechanistic underpinnings (stress and deformation) of defecation reflex/process in health and disease. The
impact of this project is that it assesses a novel, safe, low cost, less invasive, low-risk, radiation-free device in
its ability to provide better understanding of evacuation and continence mechanisms and thereby facilitate
future development of innovative therapies. The improvement can lead to improvement in diagnostic and
therapeutic modalities and reduce healthcare costs associated with anorectal disorders."

 This K01 application aims to promote the applicant's development to become a multi-disciplinarily trained and
independent academic researcher. This application's collective strengths are defined in these 3 major areas: 1)
Credentials: PI's application builds upon his productive track-record to achieve scientific independence in the
field of drug delivery and liver fibrosis, including alcohol-associated liver disease (AALD). The PI's goals include
enhancing grantsmanship, leadership, and team management skills to become an independent, tenure-track
academic researcher. In addition to technical training, PI intends to build skills in communicating with faculty
members, industry members, and students. 2) Training Environment: Drs. Mahato (mentor) and Kharbanda, and
Cheng (co-mentors) are world-class researchers and fully committed to advancing the PI's career. Particular
emphasis will be given to grant writing, collaboration building, and applying for external funding. The mentoring
committee has strong credentials in developing the next generation of successful academic scientists. The
knowledge and experience gained during this award period will help the candidate generate data to apply for an
R21/R01 grant. 3) Innovative Research: PI's central hypothesis is that alcohol-induced activation of inflammatory
pathways is mediated by AKT and BRD4 and synergize with the hedgehog (Hh) pathway to promote AALD.
Simultaneous inhibition of these pathways using targeted nanomedicine could alleviate the progression of AALD
and related morbidities. The PI has generated the following preliminary results; (a) Conditioned media from the
EtOH treated primary human hepatocytes significantly stimulated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) as determined by
α-SMA expression levels and upregulated GLI1/2 activity; (b) The protein cMYC is upregulated in patient
samples diagnosed with alcoholic hepatitis; (c) Treatment with novel inhibitors MDB5 (Hh) and SF2523
(PI3K/BRD4) showed decreased their target genes in HSC-T6 cells; (d) EtOH diet-fed mice show increased p-
AKT, cMYC, and GLI1/2 protein levels in the liver compared to mice on the control diet; (e) Treatment with
MDB5 and SF2523 decreased liver injury markers ALT and AST, and lowered GLI1, cMYC, and p-AKT protein
levels in ethanol-fed mice; (f) Novel cleavable amphiphilic peptide (CAP) was self-assembled into nanoparticles
(NPs) of size range 100± 10 nm loaded with both the drugs (payload 5% w/w); (g) CAP-NPs were sensitive to
fibroblast activation protein (FAP-α), and NPs dissembled in presence of recombinant FAP-α. Based on these
robust results, the proposal has the following specific aims: Aim 1. Establish the role of AKT/BRD4 dual inhibitor
SF2523 and Hh inhibitor MDB5 in AALD. Aim 2. Formulate and characterize HSC targeted CAP-NP loaded
with SF2523 and MDB5. Aim 3. Determine therapeutic efficacy of SF2523 and MDB5 loaded pPB-CAP-NPs in
ALD mice. The new knowledge and nanomedicine generated in this proposal may open new therapeutic avenues
for the treatment of AALD."
10914885,"Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common inherited heart disease and
the most common cause of sudden death in young people. While genetic studies have
identified specific sarcomere genes associated with HCM, they fail to predict which
patients will develop HCM. This proposal is motivated by mounting clinical and animal
model evidence for mechanical epigenetic factors possibly explaining this variance.
These data suggest that mechanical overload on the heart, caused by hypertension,
can act together with sarcomere mutations to cause maladaptive hypertrophic
remodeling in HCM. We are also motivated by the need to identify the factors underlying
the failure of drug treatments to reverse HCM: although medicines that reduce blood
pressure can reverse idiopathic (non-genetic) hypertrophy, they fail to reverse the
course of symptomatic HCM. Based upon these prior data, we hypothesize that HCM
mutations alter the magnitude of cardiac overload required to induce hypertrophic
remodeling and shorten the timeframe over which remodeling is reversible.
We aim to dissect the molecular mechanisms through which mechanical loading
integrates with sarcomere mutations to cause structural and functional pathology in
HCM linked to mutations in Myosin Binding Protein C (MYBPC3). This is possible for
the first time because we have developed a medium-throughput, human induced
pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived micro-heart muscle model system that allows us to
apply a controlled magnitude of mechanical overload to iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes.
This system will enable us to characterize the effects of overload on micro-heart muscle
derived from both iPSC without disease mutations, and from iPSC engineered to harbor
HCM patient specific MYPBC3 mutations (Aim 1). We will extend our magnetic hydrogel
technologies to dynamically control the magnitude of mechanical overload on micro-
heart muscles in situ, enabling us to determine mechanisms through which HCM
mutations render cardiomyocytes resistant to blood pressure reducing therapeutics (Aim
2). Finally, we will determine molecular mechanisms linking mechanical overload and
MYBPC3 mutations with hypertrophic remodeling (Aim 3)."

found within the tumor myeloid compartment have the important capacity of cross-presenting tumor-associated
antigens (TAA) to CD8+ T cells, and act as `master regulators' for the T cell response in cancer. We hypothesize
that in situ induction and activation of cDC1 enhances the therapeutic efficacy and immunogenicity of RT. To
test this hypothesis, we developed a combinatorial in situ radioimmunotherapy comprised of in situ administration
of: 1) Flt3L to mobilize cDC1 to the TME; 2) RT to promote immunogenic death of cancer cells and maturation
of DC; and 3) dual TLR3/CD40 stimulation to activate antigen-loaded cDC1 for priming of tumor-specific CD8+ T
cells. Our new data using multiple syngeneic orthotopic murine models of poorly immunogenic tumors
insensitive to anti-PD-L1 therapy reveal that in situ radioimmunotherapy elicits de novo adaptive T cell responses
that are characterized by novel clonotypes and stem-like Tcf1+ Slamf6+ phenotypes, renders tumors responsive
to anti-PD-L1 antibody, mediates durable complete responses, and develops tumor-specific systemic
immunological memory. Compelling evidence suggests that immunogenicity of RT can be enhanced by in situ
induction and activation of cDC1; however, immunomodulatory effect of in situ radioimmunotherapy against
distant metastatic tumors remains unclear. cDC1 prime CD4+ T cells as well as CD8+ T cells, but the role of CD4+
T cells in in situ radioimmunotherapy remains elusive. In addition, it remains unknown whether in situ
radioimmunotherapy overcomes poor T-cell infiltration in human non-T cell-inflamed tumors. In this proposal
we will elucidate the roles of CD4+ T cells in augmenting antitumor efficacy of in situ radioimmunotherapy (Aim
1). Additionally, we will seek to better understand the mechanisms underlying the immunomodulatory effect of
in situ radioimmunotherapy targeting non-irradiated distant metastatic tumors (Aim 2). Finally, in Aim 3, we will
seek to determine the alteration of the human TME in patients with unresectable and metastatic breast cancer
treated with in situ radioimmunotherapy. These studies will add essential mechanistic understanding to how RT
and the immune system interact, and provide insight into the clinical potential of in situ radioimmunotherapy
against non-T cell-inflamed tumors insensitive to anti-PD-L1 therapy."
10925299,"PROJECT SUMMARY: OUTREACH (This core is identical to all three partnering institutions)
The overall goal of the Outreach Core is to implement and evaluate an evidence-based, theory-informed, multi-
level, clinical trial and cancer genomics education program (CTC-GEP) that addresses the determinants for
African American (AA) and Latinx participation in clinical trials and cancer genomics studies. The CTC-GEP is
informed by the Increasing Minority Participation in Clinical Trials (IMPaCT) program, an efficacious clinical trials
navigator program implemented at the University of Alabama at Birmingham O’Neal Comprehensive Cancer
Center. We will build on the findings of this program and extend application of the patient navigation model to
participation in clinical trials and genomic cancer research. A cadre of lay community navigator professionals
will be trained and serve as clinical trials navigators (CCN) to deliver two unique types of toolkits comprised of
evidence-based educational resources on research participation (low-tech) and culturally tailored educational
and multiple media content via mobile tablet technology (high-tech). The CCNs will deliver these toolkits and
provide logistical support to participants interested in participating in cancer research in rural and urban
community health and academic research centers within the Partnership catchment areas. The CTC-GEP will
also address AA and Latinx beliefs, values, attitudes, concerns, and preferences related to participation in
research, such as privacy, trust, and safety. An evaluation plan based on a logic model will be applied throughout
the project. Outcome measures will be assessed through pre- and post- surveys. The outcomes of the CTC-
GEP include a) intentions to participate in research, b) awareness and knowledge about research, and c)
genomic research and clinical trial enrollment. Additionally, having a Joint Clinical and Biomedical Research
Advisory Roundtable (JCAR) guided, clinical community navigation and education program will lead to increased
awareness, opportunity and participation in genomic research and clinical trials among a diverse population of
AAs and Latinx. The rationale for this Core, intended to facilitate research and not conduct research, is to identify
effective strategies to facilitate research participation among AA and Latinx populations. Thus, the activities
outlined in this proposal are congruent with the strategies in the Comprehensive Partnerships to Advance Cancer
Health Equity (CPACHE) RFA listed for the Outreach Core."
10925303,"PROJECT SUMMARY – BIOETHICS SHARED RESOURCE (BESR)
(The Bioethics Shared Resource is identical for all three Partnering Institutions)
The Bioethics Shared Resource (BESR) is coordinated through the Tuskegee University (TU) Center for
Biomedical Research and includes bioethicists consulting for Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM), and the
University of Alabama O’Neal Comprehensive Cancer Center at Birmingham (UAB OCCC). The BESR
provides exceptional bioethics education, training, guidance, and consultation throughout the MSM/TU/UAB-
OCCC Partnership and spearheads research on bioethical issues. BESR activities fall under three overarching
and complementary objectives: (1) achieving competencies in content areas of bioethics with a focus on
cancer research ethics; (2) integrating bioethics concepts nationally, by presentation of a conference on
bioethical issues in cancer research, and throughout the Partnership by dialogue with researchers, clinicians,
faculty, students, patient advocates, community health advisors, patient navigators, recruiters, and key
personnel; and (3) conducting research to uncover and expand ethical issues from the perspectives of
underserved racial/ethnic minorities and making recommendations that inform scientific and behavioral
research and policy. The specific aims of the BESR are: (1) To expand on the strategic integration of bioethics
in all Partnership projects, at every stage of research, through collaboration with the Research Education and
Outreach Cores; (2) To collaborate in teaching graduate/undergraduate courses in bioethics, health disparities
and health policy, and bioethics in biosciences, and facilitating discussions of ethical issues in clinical trials
through the utilization of the bioethics experts across the three partner institutions; (3) To endow community
stakeholders, patient advocates, students, and investigators across all Cores and Projects with tools needed to
design, conduct, and manage ethical and culturally sensitive clinical studies through the implementation of an
e-Course on Good Clinical Practice (GCP) in social and behavioral cancer research; (4) To facilitate the ethical
engagement of study participants in medically underserved urban and rural areas of Alabama and Georgia,
addressing issues of trust/mistrust and the informed consent process in clinical and genomic studies; and (5)
To leverage the expertise and bioethics facilities at TU, MSM, and the UAB OCCC to conduct projects that
address bioethical issues in biomedical, social, and behavioral cancer research involving racial and ethnic
minorities. Expansion of these advances to the national level will be via presentation of a conference on ethical
issues in cancer research. Appropriate methods for achieving the stated aims are described in the Research
Strategy section. Planning and evaluation of outcomes are detailed in the Logic Model."
10925334,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: PLANNING AND EVALUATION CORE
The Planning and Evaluation Core (PEC) will ensure that planning, monitoring, evaluation, and tracking of
partnership activities will be comprehensive to the needs of the Meharry Medical College/Vanderbilt-Ingram
Cancer Center/Tennessee State University Cancer Partnership (MVTCP), and utilize evaluation activities to
ensure that the MVTCP is successful in contributing to the broad goals of the Comprehensive Partnerships to
Advance Cancer Health Equity (CPACHE) program. The information we garner through our evaluation
processes will be used to guide the investment of resources into projects, programs, and institutional-level
strategies such as recruitment and leveraging of resources that support the goals of the Partnership. At a time
in which cancer health disparities and inequities in research and education remain as major barriers to improving
health and quality-of-life for all, ensuring that the efforts of the MVTCP are successful is paramount. Conducting
high-quality, continuous evaluation of the MVTCP provides the opportunity to document our efforts, measure our
successes, and attend to our weaknesses for the purposes of program improvement. During the past funding
cycle, the PEC worked with all cores of the MVTCP to develop logic models that are used to identify program
theory, as well as the measurable outputs and outcomes of each core. The metrics identified through this process
were then harmonized with the CPACHE-wide evaluation indicators to create an integrated outcome framework
designed to capture the broader impact of the MVTCP. In the next funding cycle, we will build on this work to
develop evaluation tools and processes to ensure high-quality implementation of funded projects, integration
among projects and cores, and dissemination of methods and findings that demonstrate the impact of the
MVTCP. The work of PEC will be guided by the following aims: 1) foster on-going coordination facilitated by the
Administrative Core, with the Internal Advisory Committee and Program Steering Committee to ensure the
MVTCP is receiving expert feedback and guidance on cores, projects, and the performance of the MVTCP as a
whole; 2) use a combination of established and innovative evaluation techniques to assess the MVTCP and its
accomplishment of short- and long-term goals; 3) develop a culture of evaluation within the MVTCP that is
committed to the use of data to support decision making, drive quality improvement, and inform dissemination."
10925341,"PROJECT SUMMARY: RESEARCH EDUCATION CORE
The goal of the Meharry Medical College/Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center/Tennessee State Cancer Partnership
(MVTCP) Research Education Program is to facilitate the growth and career development of a new population
of outstanding underrepresented minority (URM) cancer researchers. Our current Pathway to Discovery program
begins with cancer research education for high school students, continues for undergraduate Biology/Chemistry
majors at Tennessee State University (TSU) and culminates with support for graduate students (PhD, MSPH
and MPH) at Meharry Medical College (MMC) and TSU. The program also includes research support for medical
students at MMC and Vanderbilt University (VU). This program has proven to be very successful in supporting
the progression of a diverse population of students into cancer research careers. We propose to enhance the
efficacy of the Pathway to Discovery program by including psychosocial resources derived from social cognitive
career theory (SCCT). Research experience will engage students in the development and evolution of self-
efficacy (SE) as well as a sense of being part of the scientific research community [science identity (SI)]. SCCT
research shows that strong SE and SI are especially crucial to URM students entering and completing the
necessary programs to pursue research careers, including cancer research. We propose a program grounded
in SCCT that provides psychosocial resources and research experiences needed to develop and sustain SE and
SI. MVTCP is particularly suited to target African American and Latinx undergraduate students (at TSU),
graduate (at TSU and MMC) and medical students (at MMC). High school students come from two local STEM
magnet schools with predominant URM student populations. To achieve our goals, we propose the following
aims: 1) Provide psychosocial resources for high school (8 students, 4 juniors and 4 seniors) and undergraduate
students (12 students, 3 at each level freshmen through seniors) engaged in continuous academic year and
summer cancer research experiences to ensure development of SI and SE by leveraging the cancer research
and support resources at our Partnership institutions. Development of SE and SI will be accomplished by
providing opportunities for laboratory research and communities of practice (CoP) and a series of workshops
based in SCCT. 2) Recruit and support a diverse population of graduate students (2 MPH/3 PhD students each
year) who will evolve, strengthen and maintain a strong SI and SE as they engage in cancer research with the
ultimate goal of enhancing the diversity of the cancer research workforce. SCCT-based workshops and
resources targeted at the evolution and maintenance of SE and SI in our graduate students will be implemented.
3) Provide educational research opportunities, workshops and CoP to medical students (4 students each year
at MMC/4 at VU) to ensure successful evolution, strengthening and maintenance of their SI and SE and to
sustain their interest in clinical population sciences and translational cancer research with a focus on disparities."
10925344,"PROJECT SUMMARY: CANCER OUTREACH CORE
The Cancer Outreach Core (COC) will apply a community-engaged research (CEnR) framework to facilitate and
nurture integration and partnership between the institutions in our Meharry Medical College/Vanderbilt-Ingram
Cancer Center/Tennessee State University Cancer Partnership (MVTCP). The COC will engage with our
community partners to incorporate meaningful community engagement into research and outreach to ensure
that MVTCP activities are reflecting the needs and concerns of those populations that are most affected by
cancer health disparities in the 14-county Nashville Metropolitan Statistical Area. The overarching goal of the
COC is to facilitate the reduction of cancer health disparities by leveraging the strengths of community partners to
support and enhance cancer research and outreach efforts which will be addressed by the following Specific Aims:
1) enhance community collaborations to accelerate research and implementation of programs and policy
designed to reduce cancer burden and disparities; 2) facilitate strategic research and diverse/inclusive clinical
trial participation relevant to community needs; and 3) develop innovative outreach and education strategies to
support capacity building of MVTCP stakeholders. These aims will be achieved through the collaboration of the
COC with other MVTCP cores, through a robust Community Advisory Board (CAB), and through regularly
consulting with MVTCP research projects. Given the significant regional mortality disparity among Black (compared
to white) men with prostate cancer, a CAB member representing the Prostate Cancer Coalition of Tennessee
collaborated on the pilot work that led to the submission of a full project in this renewal on prostate cancer. The higher
regional rates of ovarian cancer led to the formation of an ovarian cancer support group established through a CAB
member, enabling ongoing support of a pilot project focused on ovarian cancer. The COC will facilitate bi-directional
communications, bringing community input to the projects and disseminating results to the community. Furthermore,
MVTCP investigators leading research projects will provide presentations to the CAB and receive feedback on
presenting to lay audiences. With coordination through the Administrative Core, the COC will collaborate with
the Translational Pathology and Population Research and Clinical Trials in Cancer Equity Shared Resource
Cores to develop an educational module about biospecimen donation. With the Research Education Core
students will be engaged in community outreach utilizing new technologies aiming to reduce cancer disparities.

10925347,"PROJECT SUMMARY: PRACTICE SHARED RESOURCE CORE
The proposed Population Research And Clinical Trials In Cancer Equity (PRACTICE) Shared Resource Core
will build upon the infrastructure of the existing Clinical Trials Core (CTC) that has provided support to the
Meharry/Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center/Tennessee State Cancer Partnership (MVTCP) since its
inception. While the CTC has been instrumental in bringing clinical trials to the patient base at Nashville
General Hospital (NGH) at Meharry Medical College (MMC), to more completely address cancer health
disparities, we must augment these efforts with studies in prevention, early detection, treatment,
survivorship and palliative care in the Nashville Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), served by our
Partnership. We propose to establish the PRACTICE Shared Resource Core to further benefit the NGH
patient base, promote investigator-initiated research and extend the Partnership's reach to the underserved
in the Nashville MSA. The MVTCP has great strength in population sciences research that will enhance the
existing strength in clinical research. Examples include studies led by MMC, Tennessee State University
and Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center (VICC) investigators working with statewide cancer registries to recruit
for etiologic studies of breast cancer, lung cancer screening trials for early detection, a tobacco control trial in
the underserved, enhancing participant recruitment to cancer research and collection of biospecimens in
collaboration with the Cancer Outreach Core and Translational Pathology Shared Resource Core. There is a
rich history of conducting therapeutic clinical trials with interactions between the Clinical Trials Office (CTO) at
VICC and the CTO at NGH. The overarching mission of the PRACTICE Shared Resource Core is to enhance
accrual to therapeutic clinical trials while expanding access for minority and underserved patients to research
studies across the cancer care continuum. The PRACTICE Core worked extensively with Lucy Spalluto, MD
in the genesis of her proposed project examining the implementation of breast cancer risk assessment in
underserved women. We will assist with implementation of this study and dissemination of the results. Our Core
will also support other clinical and population-based science research across the cancer care continuum,
illustrated in three thematic domains focused on decreasing cancer health disparities: prevention and early
detection; interventional trials and observational studies during and following treatment; implementation of
healthcare interventions to improve cancer care delivery. The PRACTICE Core will address the following aims:
1) expand the portfolio of therapeutic clinical trials and cancer control studies relevant to the patient base of
NGH at Meharry and the Nashville MSA; 2) develop a cancer cohort at NGH at Meharry to serve as a resource
for future studies across the cancer care continuum; and 3) provide training and mentorship for clinical trainees
in the conduct of clinical trials and in the recruitment and retention of underserved populations in research."

Tissue Acquisition, Histology/Immunohistochemical/Histopathology, and Morphology Cores, centrally located at
MMC to provide a comprehensive suite of continually expanding high-quality services including human cancer
research tissue banking and distribution, human and animal tissue processing, sectioning, routine and special
staining, immune-based cell antigen staining, mRNA and DNA in-situ localization, histological and
histopathological review and interpretation, and a variety of state of the art imaging capabilities. The collection
of well-characterized human tissue for correlative research and molecular biology studies is a critical part of
cancer research and is the foundation for the development of effective translational medical research and
personalized molecular diagnostics and treatment. The TPSRC works collaboratively with the research
community and designs, implements, and validates new Core approaches and services. To facilitate integration
with the Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Shared Resource Core, MMC provides an on-campus office for in-house
consultation purposes for investigators who routinely utilize the TPSRC. Our collaboration with the Cancer
Outreach Core in an advocacy and educational role enhances awareness of research efforts to eliminate cancer
disparities in African American and minority groups. The TPSRC will work closely with the Population Research
And Clinical Trials In Cancer Equity (PRACTICE) Shared Resource Core for biospecimen collection. Further the
TPSRC will actively engage with the MVTCP–sponsored research projects proposed by Josiah Ochieng, PhD,
(Project 2) and Anil Shanker, PhD, (Pilot Project) to provide tissues and pathology services to support their
research initiatives."

Administration: Facilitating a Multi-Institutional Enterprise
Abstract/Summary
The Biotechnology Research Center of BioModular Multi-scale Systems (CBM2) for Precision Medicine, which
is seeking to continue its important mission through this competitive renewal application, has outlined an
aggressive and highly innovative research program that will generate new technology platforms for the analysis
of markers secured from circulation as part of the Liquid Biopsy initiative. These markers include rare biological
cells, cell free DNA, and extracellular vesicles as well as the molecular cargo they carry (DNAs, RNAs, and
proteins). In its active rendition (2015-2020), CBM2 generated new platforms for the isolation of these liquid
biopsy markers and amplification-based molecular assays of their cargo that can be used to guide clinical
decisions for a number of important disease states (i.e., Precision Medicine). Unique to this competitive renewal
is the evolution of innovative tools to enable the analysis of the liquid biopsy's molecular cargo without requiring
amplification that will provide unique opportunities, such as the analysis of epigenetic modifications in DNAs and
RNAs. Our platform technology is innovative in that the isolation steps will be integrated to the molecular analysis
steps to form fully automated mixed-scale (micro- and nanotechnologies) and modular fluidic systems. The fluidic
systems will be populated with task specific modules produced from the expiring P41 as well as innovative ones
evolving from the TR&Ds in this competitive renewal. All modules are manufactured in plastics using injection
compression molding. The modules can also be used as standalone units to facilitate dissemination.
The lofty goals envisioned by CBM2 will be realized through an accomplished multidisciplinary team of
researchers across several institutions that possess complementary skill sets. The Administrative Core of the
Center will seek to coordinate activities between the Center's researchers to aggressively move the research
program forward in a timely manner to provide compelling outputs that will not only provide unique opportunities
for the Center's Collaborative and Service Projects, but the biomedical community as a whole. The Center's
leadership team is seasoned with extensive experiences in managing large research organizations that have
demonstrated success within the research community as well as generating compelling training programs for a
variety of audiences with an interest in liquid biopsies and mixed-scale fabrication. The Leadership Team will
coordinate the research efforts of the Center with its Collaborative Projects to allow for application driven
development of the proposed technologies. The Center is well versed in transitioning its technologies into the
commercial sector to facilitate dissemination that will increase Center visibility through Service Projects. The
system design approach adopted by the Center (modular format) will facilitate the generation of integrated fluidic
systems for automating complex assays. Collaborative and Service Projects will also evolve from the Center
through the engaging Training and Dissemination Program including a robust website and extensive networks
provided by the Leadership Team as well as an active Visiting Scholar's Program."

TR&D 1: Single-Molecule Processing: Detection and Identification of Single DNAs, RNAs, and Proteins using
Immobilized Nanoscale Enzymatic Reactors (INERs) and Nanoscale Electrophoresis
Abstract/Summary
The ability to process single molecules has already demonstrated its utility in a number of basic and translational
endeavors in biology and medicine. There are tangible examples of its success including digital PCR (dPCR)
and Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). In the case of dPCR, samples are parsed into nanoliter volumes such
that each reactor volume contains statistically a single molecule, which is subsequently amplified via PCR. This
technique shows exquisite analytical sensitivity by discerning subtle target copy number variations. For NGS,
bridge PCR is used to create clonal clusters of amplified targets for sequencing-by-synthesis. Unfortunately, both
do require a PCR step, which can be problematic. For example, amplification can mask epigenetic modifications
in DNA and/or RNA that can carry important diagnostic and/or prognostic information for disease management
(i.e., Precision Medicine). While amplification-free strategies are preferred, this can be problematic when
analyzing clinical markers that are sometimes low in abundance. This is the case when attempting to analyze
blood-borne markers, such as the liquid biopsy markers. For example, a single circulating tumor cell (CTC)
carries 6 pg of genomic DNA and thus, may not be detected by NGS without significant rounds of amplification.
In this P41 competitive renewal application of CBM2, the Center will develop a suite of tools that can process
single molecules (DNAs, RNAs, and proteins) harvested from liquid biopsy markers, such as CTCs, and
extracellular vesicles (EVs), using amplification-free strategies. The unique attributes of our tools is that they will
not only detect, but also identify unamplified single molecules with high efficiency. In TR&D 1, immobilized
nanoscale enzymatic reactors (INERs) will be realized that can enzymatically digest DNAs (using Exo I
processive exonuclease), RNAs (uses XRN1, a processive exoribonuclease), and proteins (trypsin, which is a
proteolytic enzyme). A fluidic network fabricated in a plastic via nanoimprint lithography (NIL) will be generated
that contains a sub-micron pillar to which the enzyme is surface immobilized. The INERs can be connected to
nanoscale electrophoresis that can monitor in real time the reaction products with high identification accuracy
via their electrophoretic mobility (i.e., Time-of-Flight, TOF) using fluorescence single-molecule tracking during
their electrokinetic transport through a plastic-based nano-column. Unique phenomena occurring in the
nanometer electrophoresis columns will produce molecular-dependent mobilities that are not observed using
microscale columns. Coupled with outputs from TR&D 2 (in-plane nanopore sensors), the INER products can
potentially be detected using a label-free approach. An application scenario that will be demonstrated using
INERs coupled to nanoscale electrophoresis is the ability to identify membrane proteins in liquid biopsy markers,
such as extracellular vesicles (EVs). Because we are working with non-amplified targets, the tools generated by
the Center will have the ability to directly detect and identify molecular signatures that are hard to read using
amplification strategies, such as low abundance proteins."
10844391,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Diabetes mellitus, a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by hyperglycemia, affects over 37 million
individuals in the United States and 422 million worldwide and is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease,
blindness, end-stage renal disease and death. Maternal diabetes is also associated with risk for poor
pregnancy outcomes. Highly penetrant genetic forms of diabetes including maturity onset diabetes of the
young (MODY), neonatal diabetes, and syndromes that comprise both diabetes and developmental and
intellectual disabilities account for at least 1% of diabetes, or over 340,000 cases nationwide. Distinguishing
these genetic forms of diabetes from type 1 (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) demonstrably improves glucose
control and quality of life by enabling replacement of invasive insulin treatment and/or ineffective oral treatment
with less invasive and more efficacious etiology-based oral or dietary treatment for the patients and their
affected family members. In some cases, the individualized treatment can ameliorate neurological dysfunction.
However, recent studies show that most cases are misdiagnosed. There are several barriers to improving the
diagnosis rate, including lack of awareness, clinical overlap with other diabetes types, expense of testing,
genetic heterogeneity and predominance of rare variants. With the advent of next generation sequencing
techniques, testing is becoming increasingly feasible and cost-effective, but for its true potential to be realized,
a systematic process for the pooling, annotation and curation of variants is needed. Thus, we have
established an international ClinGen Monogenic Diabetes Expert Panel (MDEP) with both Variant Curation
(VCEP) and Gene Curation (GCEP) components consisting over 60 members and have developed gene-
specific rules for classifying MODY variants, curated hundreds of variants for deposit into ClinVar, and curated
the relationship with diabetes of all genes asserted as MODY genes. We now propose to move another step
toward our goal of true precision medicine for diabetes mellitus through comprehensive curation of the
relationship of diabetes and congenital hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia with 70+ genes which have been
proposed as monogenic diabetes genes and to develop and apply gene specific rules to the curation of
variants in monogenic forms of autoimmune diabetes and insulin resistance/lipodystrophies, which have
individualized treatment implications distinct from the MODYs, including the opportunity to prevent extra-
pancreatic disease in multi-organ autoimmune forms and to treat the underlying leptin deficiency found in many
lipodystrophies."
10888364,"Project Summary
Patients with epilepsy have a 25-fold elevated risk of sudden death. Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy
(SUDEP) is the most common disease-related cause of premature mortality in people with seizure disorders,
affecting 1 of every 1000 patients annually. Despite this, mechanisms and risk factors of SUDEP remain largely
unknown. Having ongoing generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) and no nocturnal supervision are the only
definite risk factors, and reducing seizures is the only currently available preventive strategy. Several other
clinical factors and potential biomarkers such as prolonged post-ictal generalized EEG suppression (PGES) that
follows GTCS, abnormal inter-ictal ECG, and structural brain MRI abnormalities were associated with increased
SUDEP risk, but none were rigorously confirmed in a large case-control study. While limitations of single-center
studies in accumulating a sufficient number of cases are well recognized, prospective multicenter studies are
also severely limited by the time, expense, and loss of follow-up constraining sample size and power. To sidestep
these limitations, we propose a retrospective multisite case-control study that will screen >40,000 patients from
86 epilepsy monitoring centers worldwide, with a conservative expected total of >185 SUDEP cases and 370
age/sex-matched controls. Employing our comprehensive approaches to identify SUDEP cases combined with
novel data harmonization techniques will allow us to: 1) provide an unprecedentedly large curated dataset of
SUDEP, 2) identify clinical, electrophysiological, and imaging predictors of SUDEP using advanced machine
learning methods, and 3) develop an individualized model to predict SUDEP risk that can be used in clinic.
The proposed study will test the hypothesis that SUDEP cases exhibit different electroclinical and imaging
characteristics that can provide an individualized prediction model. We will identify ictal electroclinical and
interictal electrophysiological and neuroimaging biomarkers of SUDEP. We will compare markers of seizure
severity between SUDEP cases and age/sex-matched living epilepsy patients, including decerebrate or
decorticate posturing during GTCS, PGES duration, postictal bradycardia + asystole and post-convulsive central
apnea. Additionally, we will assess putative interictal biomarkers including decreased low frequency power in
ECG heart rate variability and decreased MRI-derived volumes in the right hippocampus/amygdala and
brainstem. We will also employ machine-learning techniques to uncover novel biomarkers from interictal
electrophysiological data. Finally, using a Bayesian framework, we will develop an individualized SUDEP risk
prediction tool that combines clinical features with measures derived from routine EEG, ECG, and MRI.
Our goal is to create a SUDEP case-control dataset to identify clinical risk factors and biomarkers that will help
to create a robust model of an individual’s SUDEP risk based on measures derived from routine clinical care and
testing such as interictal ECG, MRI and EEG. Such a tool could transform clinical practice, facilitate trials of
SUDEP interventions, and ultimately save lives."
10684761,"The goal of this proposal is to further evaluate the safety and feasibility of gene transfer to provide aromatic L- amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) enzyme into the midbrain of patients with AADC deficiency and continue Biologics License Application (BLA)-enabling studies as per FDA recommendations. AADC deficiency is a devastating genetic neurometabolic disorder which causes hypotonia, dystonia, intense and long-lasting oculogyric crises (OGC), developmental delay and chronic and severe neurological dysfunction. A gene therapy based on delivering of a recombinant adeno-associated virus carrying the DDC human gene (AAV2-AADC) to the brain structures that physiologically AADC enzyme (midbrain) could be a most needed disease-modifying treatment for AADC deficiency. Eight (8) AADC deficient patients have been treated (160 µL) in our initial NIH- funded trial in the US under BB-IND-16127 and an additional 15 subjects under an ethics committee-approved compassionate use program (CUP) in Poland. The latter received a larger infusion volume (≤300 μL) and a shorter surgical procedure. Both approaches were safe and well-tolerated regardless of dose or volume of infusion. OGCs stopped a few weeks after the surgery and subjects’ sleep, mood and irritability improved. Most subjects are gaining head control and muscular tone, developing purposeful movements and some are even sitting up and starting to walk without support, regardless of their age. Encouraged by the safety and positive biomarker and clinical outcomes observed in those groups, we propose an extension of the BB-IND-16127 study to (i) determine the long-term (up to 5 years) safety and tolerability of the surgical infusion of already treated subjects (n=8) (ii) determine the safety and tolerability of a larger volume of Cohort 2 vector concentration into the SN/VTA administered via a surgical procedure optimized to increase safety by reducing surgical and anesthesia times (single-cannula insertion per hemisphere) in AADC deficient patients >4 years, and (iii) demonstrate effective restoration of AADC function by measuring CSF neurotransmitter metabolites and changes in brain FDOPA uptake on PET imaging. This will be a multi-center study with subjects to be treated at The Ohio State University and at the University of California San Francisco. As per our discussions with FDA, the study design includes a 12-month lead-in period that will serve as a natural history control group to explore potential efficacy of this novel treatment. Cohorts 3 (4-13 years, n≤12) and 4 (>13 years, n≤12) will then receive a larger infusion volume of AAV2-AADC at the same titer Cohort 2 received (2.6 x 1012 vg/mL; up to 300 μL/hemisphere). Renewal of funding for this trial will enable assessment of the safety and tolerability of an optimized dose and delivery procedure to enhance distribution of AADC expression within the midbrain, which we hypothesize may lead to further clinical improvement. Completion of this exploratory clinical trial will pave the way to registration of this disease-modifying AAV2-hAADC gene therapy for AADC deficiency and future gene therapies for other neurological disorders."
10929951,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Broad Impact: Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in American men and in 2022
alone will result in the death of over 34,000 men. PCa mortality is typically caused by disease that has
advanced to the metastatic castration-resistant stage (mCRPC) and has spread to distant sites such as the
bone, brain, liver, and lymph nodes. Currently, there are no effective or curative therapeutic strategies for
mCRPC, which is in part due to high rates of acquired drug resistance to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)
and the standard-of-care chemotherapy drug for mCRPC, docetaxel (DTX). Consequently, there is a critical
need for novel and effective therapeutic options for mCRPC. Recent findings have indicated glutamine and
related glutamate metabolism as significant drivers of the metabolic reprogramming of mCRPC that contributes
to drug resistance mechanisms. Indeed, a metabolic switch has been identified in PCa following ADT that
allows the cells to rely on the androgen-independent isoform of glutaminase (GLS1, the enzyme that converts
glutamine to glutamate) rather than the isoform that is inhibited by ADT, affording drug resistance. Efforts to
chemically inhibit GLS1 to overcome this issue have failed since there is a steady influx of glutamate via the
xCT transporter when there are physiologically-relevant levels of cystine. However, our preliminary data shows
that concurrently inhibiting GLS1 as well as glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH, the enzyme that converts
glutamate to the TCA cycle intermediate alpha-ketoglutarate) may be sufficient to overcome this resistance
mechanism across PCa subtypes including mCRPC. The overall goal of this project is to identify novel
combinatorial treatments for mCRPC that synergize with DTX to target metabolic vulnerabilities and overcome
drug resistance for improved treatment outcomes. Central hypothesis: Concurrent inhibition of GLS1 and GDH
in combination with DTX can circumvent drug resistance mechanisms and increase therapeutic efficacy
compared to SOC in mCRPC. Aim 1: Determine the metabolic role of GLS1 inhibition with CB-839 plus DTX
for the synergistic inhibition of PCa tumor growth in vivo. Aim 2: Elucidate the impact of concurrent GLS1 and
GDH inhibition plus DTX on PCa growth, proliferation, metabolism, aggressiveness, and invasiveness
compared to SOC in vitro. Aim 3: Evaluate whether combination treatment with a GLS1 inhibitor and a GDH
inhibitor plus DTX can synergistically inhibit PCa growth more effectively than SOC in vivo. Experimental
techniques including metabolomics, metabolic flux analysis using stable isotope tracers, in vitro and in vivo
modeling of mCRPC, and validation of drug treatment efficacy will be undertaken to achieve the research
goals. These findings will be used to inform novel treatment strategies to accompany docetaxel to prevent
cancer growth, proliferation, and aggressiveness in mCRPC for more effective treatments and improved
outcomes for patients with mCRPC."

Pancreatic Cancer (PaC) represents 3.2% of all new cancer cases in the US and is the third leading cause of cancer
mortality. The prognosis for PaC is dismal and has remained almost unchanged for decades, indicating that
current treatments are inadequate. Thus, there is an urgent need for new therapies for this mortal disease.
ABTL0812 is a small molecule with anti-cancer activity through a unique mechanism of action. ABTL0812
inhibits the PI3/Akt/mTOR (PAM) pathway by binding to the nuclear receptors PPARα and γ, which induce
TRIB3, a pseudo kinase that binds to Akt and impedes its activation, leading to mTOR inhibition and
consequently to autophagy-dependent cancer cell death. The PAM pathway is responsible for the tumorigenesis
of many cancers, including PaC, as well as for the development of resistance to different treatments, such as
chemotherapy. Since ABTL0812 targets are expressed in pancreatic cells, ABTL0812 was tested in vitro and in
vivo in PaC models, showing antitumor activity as a single agent and combined with chemotherapy by inducing
a potentiation effect. ABTL0812 successfully concluded a First-in-Human Phase I clinical trial (EudraCT 2013-
001293-17) in advance solid tumors, where it was shown its safety and tolerability. The recommended Phase II
dose (RP2D) was determined based on PK/PD modelling, since no Dose-Limiting Toxicities were detected and
a Maximum Tolerated Dose was not achieved. Additionally, several long disease stabilizations of up to 18 months
were found, indicating potential signs of efficacy. These promising results led to an ongoing Phase I/II clinical
trial, where ABTL0812 is given as first line therapy in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin (P/C) in
patients with advanced endometrial cancer (EC) or squamous non-small cell lung carcinoma (EudraCT 2016-
001352-21) in Spain and France. The same protocol is approved by the FDA (IND 137394). To date, phase I has
been successfully completed and interim results of the phase II has shown long-term responses. In the EC arm,
ABTL0812 combined with P/C increases by almost 50% the efficacy of P/C alone; ORR is increased from 52% to
75%. The aim of the proposed phase I/II study is to evaluate ABTL0812 in combination with gemcitabine and
nab-paclitaxel (Gm/P) as first line therapy in metastatic PaC. Based on the important role of PAM pathway in
PaC and in chemotherapy resistance, and in our preclinical data that shows that ABTL0812 potentiates Gm/P
efficacy, together with the clinical data, we expect that this trial will demonstrate that ABTL0812 improves the
clinical treatment of PaC. In addition, a biomarkers program will be run that could lead to a response prediction
companion diagnostic. This study will be the first step towards the potential clinical application of ABTL0812 to
treat PaC. Once the phase I part is completed, the safety and tolerability of ABTL0812 in combination with Gm/P
will be determined. In the subsequent phase II, the efficacy of the proposed combined treatment compared to
chemotherapy will be determined. If a significant improvement is detected, that will lead to a larger phase II or
III trial to confirm this patient´s treatment improvement."

Hemianopia (the loss of half the field of vision on the same side in both eyes) is a severe visual consequence
of stroke and traumatic brain injury. Resuming driving after the onset of hemianopia is an important goal to
maintain independence and quality of life. People with hemianopia are permitted to drive in about 18 states.
However, in a retrospective analysis of crash records, drivers with hemianopia were found to have a higher risk
for crashes than drivers with a full field of vision. Intersections are especially challenging for drivers with
hemianopia as a wide field (up to 180°) has to be checked for potential hazards, requiring head as well as eye
movements. If drivers with hemianopia do not scan (look) toward the side of the hemianopia, or do not scan far
enough, then a hazard that appears within a field loss area might never be seen or might be seen too late to
make a safe driving response. Although there is strong evidence of inadequate scanning by people with
hemianopia in simulated driving, little is known about their scanning behaviors and the extent to which
inadequate scanning contributes to collision risk in real-world driving. The overall goals of this research are to
(1) Investigate inadequate scanning and factors contributing to near-collision incidents (a proxy for actual
collisions) in naturalistic driving; (2) Evaluate the efficacy of a novel approach to scanning training to address
intersection scanning deficits; and (3) Evaluate whether scanning training in the simulator transfers to real-
world driving. To address the first goal, in Aim 1, drivers with hemianopia and drivers with normal vision will
complete an extended period of driving with a video-recording system in their own vehicle. This will provide
important data to better understand factors contributing to inadequate scanning in naturalistic driving and the
role of inadequate scanning as compared to other at-risk behaviors in near-collision incidents. To address the
second and third goals, randomized controlled clinical trials will be conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the
scanning training for former drivers with hemianopia (Aim 2) and current drivers with hemianopia (Aim 3).
Scanning training will be given in a simulator. In Aim 2 the effects of the training on intersection scanning and
responses to hazards will be evaluated in the driving simulator. In Aim 3, the effects of the training will be
evaluated through recordings of scanning behaviors in naturalistic driving before and after training, which will
enable an evaluation of whether training in the simulator generalizes to improvements in scanning in real-world
driving. The program of research will also examine whether scanning in the virtual environment of a driving
simulator is representative of scanning in real-world driving as a first step toward validating the driving
simulator as a tool for both training and evaluation of scanning of at-risk drivers. The proposed research has
the potential to make a significant contribution toward improving road safety by improving scanning of drivers
with hemianopia, thereby improving detection of hazards and reducing their collision risk at intersections."

Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are the projection neurons of the retina that serve as the connection between the
eye and the brain. In this role, they allow for the transmission of visual information to thalamic targets, with
damage to this pathway in injury or disease leading to vision loss or blindness. Glial cells, particularly astrocytes
and microglia, are found adjacent to RGCs within the optic nerve, where they maintain homeostatic conditions
for RGCs to ensure proper health and functionality. Conversely, neuroinflammatory conditions occur when
astrocytes and microglia are induced to adopt a reactive state, leading to the degeneration of RGCs.
Neuroinflammation has been associated with a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, but the pathology of
neuroinflammation in glaucoma is unique due to the highly localized nature of glial reactivity in the optic nerve
head as RGC axons exit the eye, correlated with the initial site of injury along RGC axons in glaucoma. While
animal models have demonstrated the importance of glia in neuronal development and degeneration, important
differences exist between animal models and human patients, including low conservation of RGCs as well as
numerous functional differences in glia. As such, the development of a human model of these cellular interactions
would further expand our understanding of how glia provide support for RGCs, as well as how glia respond
during neuroinflammatory conditions leading to the degeneration of RGCs in glaucoma. Human pluripotent stem
cells (hPSCs) can serve as powerful in vitro models for the study of retinal development and disease, with
previous studies demonstrating the ability to model RGC neurodegeneration in vitro. However, these studies
have not focused upon the compartmentalized nature of RGCs, nor how reactive glia disproportionally affect the
axons of RGCs in neuroinflammatory conditions. Thus, to address the shortcomings of existing hPSC-based
models of glaucoma and to better recapitulate interactions between RGCs and glia, the current application
leverages a robust and reproducible in vitro model to recreate the spatial interactions of glia upon human RGC
axons relevant to the neurodegenerative phenotypes observed in glaucoma. Interactions between glia and RGC
compartments will be analyzed in quiescent and reactive states, and the functional consequences of reactive
glia upon RGC axons will be assessed phenotypically, transcriptionally, and functionally to identify the extent to
which reactive glia modulate RGC neurodegeneration. The successful pursuit of the following aims will leverage
a powerful microfluidic platform for the analysis of RGC axons to include the neuroinflammatory effects of glia
and will provide opportunities to further elucidate fundamental neurodegenerative mechanisms in human RGCs,
as well as to develop novel therapeutic approaches to slow or reverse neurodegeneration."

The proposed project, My Home, My Health: Place-Based Public Health Resources for Rural
Educators, will address future bioscience workforce needs by engaging rural underserved youth, improving
the teaching skills of informal educators, and leveraging the expertise and research of Montana's NIH-
supported scientists. Montana State University in partnership with three tribal colleges -- Salish Kootenai
College, Blackfeet Community College, and Chief Dull Knife College -- and researchers of the Montana
IDeA Network of Biomedical Research Excellence (INBRE), will build a model for how INBRE networks can
train their researchers to create outreach kits with the communities they serve in order to reach underserved
youth. Additionally, the project will draw upon the expertise and community contacts of the NIH-funded
American Indian / Alaska Native Clinical & Translational Research Program (AI/AN CTRP). My Home, My
Health will create a series of hands-on, place-based activity kits that will focus on a broad definition of
disease ecology encompassing multidimensional picture of the interplay of abiotic conditions with multiple
pathogens and hosts interacting within a whole ecosystem. The project addresses the NIH goal to ""foster a
better understanding of biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research and its implications"" by engaging
communities to create regionally relevant hands-on activities that will help to attract underserved audiences
to STEM, give youth the opportunity to gain and practice STEM skills relevant to bioscience professions,
and enhance educator professional development. The project team will be searching for exemplary
practices to improve STEM learning outcomes that can be measured, replicated and disseminated. The
project includes INBRE tribal college researchers and afterschool program educators in three targeted
communities: The Northern Cheyenne, Blackfeet and Flathead Reservations. My Home, My Health will train
30 INBRE researchers (undergrads, graduate students, and faculty) in science communication and
outreach so they can help design and pilot the kits with youth. The project team will also train 50 informal
educators from around Montana in how to use the project's lessons, which will improve the educators'
content knowledge of disease ecology. In total, the project will impact 2,260 youth, 50 educators and 30
early-career and established researchers. After the SEPA grant is completed, the project model will
ultimately become part of Montana INBRE's future training and outreach with 50 INBRE researchers
participating each summer. INBRE will use and lend out the kits to educators around the state and continue
to create new kits. The project team includes two PIs that are women of color and there are six Native
Americans from five tribes acting as staff and/or advisors."
10900691,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The overall goal of this proposal is to examine the changes in cortical network activity in the parkinsonian state
and how these are modified during DBS or administration of levodopa and improvement in motor signs.
Although multiple studies have examined the changes in basal ganglia activity that occur in the parkinsonian
state, there are few studies and little understanding of the changes in cortical neuronal activity, function, how
these changes mediate the development of motor signs, or how they are modulated during deep brain
stimulation (DBS). In our previous proposal we have made significant strides in characterizing the changes in
neuronal activity in the supplementary and motor cortices (SMA and MC) in the parkinsonian condition and
during STN or GPi DBS using the MPTP monkey model of PD. The current proposal continues and broadens
this work to include the dorsolateral prefrontal and dorsal premotor cortices (DLPFC and PMd), areas with
known anatomical connections to the basal ganglia, which are intimately involved in motor control and in the
development of parkinsonian motor signs but have been largely ignored in nonhuman primate studies of PD
pathophysiology. In this proposal we will examine cortical network function in PD by characterizing the
changes in neuronal activity that occur within and across the DLPFC, PMd, SMA and MC in the parkinsonian
state using the MPTP monkey model of PD, examine how DBS in the internal and external segments of the
globus pallidus (GPi and GPe, respectively) and subthalamic nucleus (STN) modify this activity, and how the
changes associated with DBS compare to that which occurs with administration of levodopa. We will
simultaneously record from populations of cells in the DLPFC, PMd, SMA and MC using Utah arrays in the
DLPFC, PMd, and MC, and Gray Matter devices in the SMA, at rest and during passive and active movement
and compare results across the following conditions: normal, parkinsonian, parkinsonian + DBS in three
different sites (GPe, GPi and STN), and parkinsonism + L-dopa (alone and in combination with DBS in each of
the three sites). We will explore the role of GPe as an alternative target to STN and GPi DBS given our
previous studies demonstrating its suppressive effects on both STN and GPi. Characteristics of neuronal
activity and connectivity changes will be correlated with the development of parkinsonian motor signs, their
amelioration during DBS and L-dopa and to changes in the planning, initiation and execution of movement."

Leadership and Educational Advancement Program for Diverse Scholars
This proposed project is an evidence-informed mentoring and leadership development program
for early career social and behavioral scientists from underrepresented racial and ethnic
populations who show promise in research related to the NIDDK mission but who have not yet
received R01 funding and have not ascended to a leadership position in their respective disciplines
or professional associations. Three cohorts of 10 postdoctoral scholars from underrepresented
populations will be recruited to participate over the course of five years. Each mentee will take
part in a two-year mentorship program and will be matched with volunteer mentors who are
leading researcher in diabetes and other endocrine and metabolic diseases, have expertise in the
trainee’s area of interest, and who have a track record of receiving federal funding. Training
mechanisms will include: 1) online group training sessions focused on critical topics associated
developing a successful research proposal in diabetes, endocrine or other metabolic diseases; 2)
1:1 mentoring from volunteer mentors; 3) a hybrid virtual and in-person leadership development
course; 4) a leadership shadowing program; and 5) executive coaching. The program will help
trainees to 1) conceptualize, draft, and submit a high-quality research application to an
appropriate federal funding mechanism (particularly NIDDK and other NIH agencies) or national
foundation, and 2) obtain the relevant leadership skills necessary to become competitive for
leadership positions in academic careers of interest to NIDDK. The program also aims to support
opportunities to increase diverse scientific leadership at the American Psychological Association
through the leadership shadowing program."
10887584,"Pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy is characterized by the appearance of morphological abnormalities in the
retinal capillary vessels. Although such abnormalities are used in the clinical evaluation of the disease severity,
the hemodynamic mechanisms underlying their development and progression remain unknown. These
morphological abnormalities are highly localized in specific regions of the retinal vascular network, and may
correlate with the local variations of the hemodynamic parameters and forces. Diabetic conditions significantly
alter the biophysical properties of the blood cells, however the influence of such altered biophysical properties
on the retinal hemodynamics and pathogenesis of retinopathy are not known. Existing in vivo imaging
techniques have limitations in terms of the hemodynamic measurements in the topologically complex and multi-
plexus retinal vasculature. Additionally, tissue hypoxia and the loss of blood flow autoregulation are pathogenic
factors in retinopathy. No study exists that correlates diabetes-mediated altered biophysics of the individual
blood cell to the loss of retinal tissue oxygenation and flow regulation. Our underlying hypotheses are: (i)
altered biophysics of diabetic red blood cells (RBC) alone can mediate vascular abnormalities by altering the
hemodynamic parameters and forces; and (ii) such changes are spatially heterogeneous across the retinal
vascular network, and correlate with the focal and heterogeneous nature of vascular abnormalities. The broad
objective of this project is to understand the relationship between the hemodynamics of diabetic blood cells,
retinal vascular network topology, and pathogenesis of retinopathy, using a high-fidelity, predictive
computational modeling study. Specific aims are: 1) To develop a multiscale computational model of the
diabetic retinopathy hemodynamics taking into consideration the precise microstructural and geometric details
of the 3D vascular networks as obtained from in vivo images of the human retina, and 3D deformation of every
single blood cell with altered biophysical properties representing diabetic conditions. 2) To predict diabetic
RBC-mediated alteration in the retinal hemodynamics, and how such changes are correlated to the formation
and heterogeneity of microvascular abnormalities and vascular adaptation at different stages of progressive
retinopathy. 3) To evaluate the significance of diverse cellular-scale hemodynamic pathways involved. 4) To
predict the role of RBC hemodynamics on retinal hypoxia and loss of nitric oxide bioavailability as pathogenic
factors in retinopathy. This study is significant and innovative because it will (i) develop the first high-fidelity,
predictive computational model that combines the exact 3D geometry of ultra-large-scale and multi-plexus in
silico retinal vasculature, and 3D deformation and rheology of every blood cell, (ii) provide a rheology-
topology coupling mechanism as a basis of hemodynamics-mediated initiation and progression of vascular
abnormalities, (ii) directly model heterotypic individual cell-cell and cell-endothelium interactions, and (iv)
couple individual RBC transient deformation with blood and retinal tissue gas transport."
10916220,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Tuberculosis (TB) remains a leading cause of death globally, particularly among HIV-positive people.
Understanding the dynamics of TB transmission in the era of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is key to halting TB
transmission. As ART roll-out progresses, whether the contribution of people taking ART to TB transmission is
increasing is unknown. Community TB surveys consistently show that about half of people with infectious TB
do not report symptoms, and are therefore missed by most current TB screening efforts. The objective of this
project is define how to target TB case-finding efforts to maximise impact while retaining cost-effectiveness, in
settings of high HIV prevalence and mature ART programs. Our central hypothesis is that populations and
settings can be defined where ""symptom-agnostic"" TB screening (i.e. not limited to symptomatic people) has a
major impact on TB transmission, and is cost-effective. The project aims are (1) to compare the infectiousness
of HIV-positive people taking ART compared to those not taking ART; (2) to assess the infectiousness of the
""walking well"", i.e. people with asymptomatic TB; (3) to model the impact and cost-effectiveness of symptom-
agnostic screening at different levels of the health system. The project will be conducted in the context of the
Africa Health Research Institute (AHRI)'s demographic surveillance area in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa where
TB incidence, HIV prevalence and ART coverage are high, and a population survey using mass radiographic
screening for TB has started. We will accomplish our aims through a household contact study, measuring the
proportion of child household contacts who have TB infection, comparing groups of households according to
characteristics of the index TB patient. For Aim 1, we will compare the proportion of child contacts with TB
infection between HIV-positive index TB patients who are vs. are not taking ART. For Aim 2, we will compare
the proportion of child contacts with TB infection between asymptomatic index TB patients who do not report
any symptoms (identified by AHRI's population TB survey) vs. symptomatic index TB patients. This gives us a
unique opportunity to investigate TB transmission from people who do not report TB symptoms, who are
missed by most TB screening programs. In Aim 3 we will use a novel mathematical model, incorporating new
insights into TB natural history and transmission gained from Aims 1 and 2, to determine the circumstances
under which symptom-agnostic screening would have most impact on TB incidence and mortality, and explore
comparative cost-effectiveness of interventions along the diagnostic pathway at different levels of the health
system. By combining population-based epidemiology with mathematical and economic modelling, our project
will delineate (i) whether more resources should be dedicated to earlier identification of TB among people
taking ART; (ii) whether symptom-agnostic screening of the ""walking well""; should be considered and (iii) under
what conditions. This could inform a paradigm shift in TB case-finding strategy."
10813053,"Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a chronic relapsing disease that constitutes a major health problem for Veterans
and society in general. Likewise, stress-related disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are
highly debilitating and present with especially high prevalence in Veterans as well. Stress is known to play a
significant role in triggering relapse and promoting excessive, harmful levels of alcohol use. This is of particular
concern because the frequent co-occurrence of stress and alcohol related disorders is associated with more
severe clinical symptoms and medical complications compared to either disorder alone. The prevalence of PTSD
and AUD comorbidity is especially high in Veterans, with prevalence rates reported in the 55-75% range. Given
the high prevalence of PTSD-AUD comorbidity in Veterans, it is not surprising that the Department of Veterans
Affairs has highlighted this as a special and high priority research area. Thus, the need to better understand
underlying mechanisms of stress-alcohol interactions is paramount to developing more effective treatment
strategies to address this significant medical problem.
The overall focus of Dr. Becker’s Alcohol Research Program at the Charleston RHJ VA Medical Center is aimed
at elucidating neural mechanisms and brain circuits underlying the ability of stress and chronic alcohol (ethanol)
exposure to promote/mediate excessive levels of drinking. The Becker research lab has played a leading role in
developing novel, clinically relevant animal models that enable multidisciplinary analyses of the complex and
dynamic nature of stress-alcohol interactions. The research program employs a comprehensive and integrative
approach, utilizing innovative neurobehavioral, neurochemical, and molecular biology techniques to address
research questions of particular relevance to the overall VA health care mission.
One line of research focuses on the role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in stress-enhanced alcohol
drinking. We showed that chronic alcohol-induced excessive drinking is associated with a deficit in cortical BDNF
expression, an effect exacerbated by stress. Increasing cortical BDNF activity reversed these effects and since
exercise is known to elevate BDNF levels in brain, we are currently employing molecular and pharmacological
approaches to examine mechanisms by which exercise increases BDNF signaling in the brain and thereby
reversing the ability of stress to enhance alcohol drinking. Another set of studies utilizes molecular,
chemogenetic, and pharmacological approaches to examine mechanisms and circuitry underlying adaptations
in pro-stress (dynorphin) and anti-stress (oxytocin) neuropeptides that contribute to stress-enhanced drinking
and relapse. Using a novel model of PTSD-AUD comorbidity that demonstrates long-lasting sensitization of
stress-induced alcohol relapse/drinking in mice with a history of chronic stress exposure, selective targeting of
subpopulations of neurons and specific brain pathways has advanced new insights about mechanisms
underlying excessive drinking, increased relapse vulnerability, and impaired behavioral/cognitive flexibility
associated with stress and chronic alcohol exposure. Another long-standing area of focus in the Becker lab has
been the development of clinically relevant animal models that facilitate discovery of new and novel treatment
targets as well as utilizing these models to evaluate potential therapeutic strategies for mitigating maladaptive
changes that engender harmful alcohol drinking and the capacity for stress to exacerbate the problem.
Collectively, Dr. Becker’s Alcohol Research Program embraces cutting-edge, translational research efforts
dedicated to developing more effective treatment strategies for stress and alcohol related disorders – a
significant medical problem for Veterans. As such, his research, administrative, and educational leadership role
as SRCS continues to significantly impact and contribute to the overall VA patient care mission."
10911215,"SUMMARY
 My laboratory has been interested in the mechanisms that control the identity and the fate of cancer cells
during tumor evolution, including in response to treatment. We have made important contributions to this field
of research in the past decade. Our work on the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor Rb in stem cells and cancer
models has identified a new function role for Rb in the control of cell identity and plasticity, which explains in
part why Rb-mutant cancer cells often fail to respond to therapy. Our pioneering work on Rb-mutant small cell
lung cancer (SCLC) has provided fundamental novel insights into the biology of this neuroendocrine cancer.
 SCLC is the most lethal form of lung cancer. Treatment options have remained virtually unchanged for the
past 30 years. SCLC kills ~250,000 patients worldwide every year. As the number of heavy smokers worldwide
continues to grow, SCLC will remain a major health issue this century. With unique tools to study SCLC in vivo
and a highly resourceful network of collaborators, we are uniquely placed to continue to greatly impact the
SCLC field by confronting key issues that few investigators address. Importantly, our research combines
technically innovative approaches that will allow us to address questions about SCLC progression and
maintenance that are difficult, if not impossible, to tackle using traditional human tumor-derived cell lines,
previous mouse models, or cancer patient samples. We have developed rapid and accurate mouse models of
human SCLC. We have used these models and patient-derived xenografts to identify the cell of origin of SCLC
and biomarkers for early detection, as well as drivers of the tumorigenic phenotype of SCLC and their
mechanisms of action. We have also contributed to the elucidation of the genomic landscape of mouse and
human SCLC tumors. Notably, our findings have led to the implementation of clinical trials in SCLC patients.
 In the next 7 years, we will continue to use SCLC as a paradigm to elucidate the mechanisms that
determine the identity of cancer cells, their plasticity, and their fate. We will perform these studies in the context
of our recent breakthroughs investigating inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity in primary mouse and human
SCLC tumors. Our model is that SCLC tumors, which have very few stromal cells, generate their own
microenvironment to support their growth, in part through activation of Notch signaling. This intra-tumoral
heterogeneity may critically contribute to the lack of response of tumors to therapies. A second major focus of
our work is to elucidate the mechanisms that underlie the striking metastatic ability of SCLC to multiple organs,
including the brain. We propose that the switch to a more neuronal differentiation state that accompanies the
gain of metastatic ability of neuroendocrine SCLC cells is a key aspect of this high metastatic potential. We will
test these ideas in vivo and ex vivo using a combination of unique genetic, molecular, and cellular approaches."
10844386,"Pertussis (Whooping cough) is a highly contagious, airborne disease that is rapidly re-emerging as a serious
public health threat in the United States. Despite high vaccine coverage, annual reported cases in the U.S. have
been increasing recently, with an average of 25,000 per year from 2010-2019. This is a level unseen since the
early 1960s. Diagnosis of pertussis is challenging because its early symptoms (during the contagious catarrhal
stage, prior to paroxysmal cough) overlap with other respiratory diseases. This is analogous to the diagnostic
challenge of COVID-19. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has illustrated the critical public health importance of
accessible, rapid diagnostics for controlling the spread of highly transmissible respiratory diseases, a category
that includes pertussis. Consequently, as with COVID-19, there is a critical need to develop improved pertussis
diagnostics to enable prompt, appropriate patient treatment as well as limit needless community transmission.
The project goal is a rapid, point-of-care (POC), lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) to detect Bordetella pertussis
antigen from nasopharyngeal specimens. The target population will be symptomatic patients who present in
pediatrician offices, urgent care clinics, or small hospital ERs. The product will be a sensitive and specific test
that enables immediate action, akin to other highly used and accepted LFIAs (e.g. COVID-19, RSV).
This proposal builds on data and results from Phases I and II. First, the B. pertussis protein tracheal colonization
factor A (TcfA) was identified as a specific biomarker for presence of the bacterium. Second, a library of epitope-
mapped monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with high affinity and specificity to TcfA was developed. Third, over 784
permutations of mAb combinations were evaluated for construction of a LFIA. Fourth, the prototype LFIA’s
configuration was optimized for high specificity and sensitivity for detection of both purified TcfA and clinically
relevant concentrations of B. pertussis cells. Fifth, the prototype LFIA showed high sensitivity and specificity for
diagnosis of pertussis in a baboon model. Finally, proof-of-concept was demonstrated with patient specimens.
Per the original plan, Phase IIb builds on Phases I and II to deliver an FDA-cleared diagnostic. Three aims are
proposed. Aim 1 includes an FDA Pre-Submission and transitions from a research-grade, prototype LFIA to a
commercial-grade product made under GMP. Aim 2 is a pre-clinical evaluation of precision and reproducibility,
limit of detection, analytical specificity and inclusivity, stability, ruggedness, interfering substances, and microbial
interference. Aim 3 is a clinical evaluation that will end with a FDA 510(k) Submission. If successful, this study
will deliver a pertussis POC test that is easily accessible to all clinics and that provides results in an actionable
timeframe – thereby reducing patient morbidity and preventing unnecessary community transmission."

Racism is one of the most urgent and broadly impactful crises in contemporary society, increasing an
array of adverse health outcomes including mortality in Black Americans, yet neuroscientists and
psychologists have heretofore shied away from directly examining personal experiences with racism
and their consequences on the brain, mind, and body. Such investigation is essential because it will
allow us to better characterize mechanistic pathways linking experiences with racism to health
disparities and to devise potential strategies for addressing such disparities. Repeated exposures to
racism likely trigger and amplify a cascade of stress-related brain and physiological responses that are
known to mediate elevated risk for adverse health outcomes. In this project, we will examine several
elements of this mechanistic cascade. We aim to apply validated scientific paradigms in novel ways to
examine brain, physiological, and psychological responses to the recollection of specific personal
experiences with racism – compared to other types of life experiences – among people who identify as
Black or African American. We will also use prospective smartphone-based ecological momentary
assessment (EMA) methods to measure the frequency and severity of experiences with racism as they
occur in daily life in real time, and we will associate these measures with brain, physiological, and
health outcomes. We will examine the relationship between brain/physiological responses to racism
and health outcomes and functioning measures – such as psychological distress, cardiovascular
disease risk, cellular aging (telomere length), hair cortisol, coping, emotion regulation, and social
support – and determine whether brain and physiological responses mediate the relationship between
extent of racism exposure and health outcomes. The proposed investigation represents an innovative
paradigm shift, in which racism is treated like other pathophysiological processes that affect health. We
have assembled an interdisciplinary team with expertise in areas including neuroimaging, trauma,
biomarkers of stress, physiological perspectives on health disparities, ecological momentary
assessment, emotion regulation, and the empirical study of anti-Black racism, yielding a collaborative
effort that is unique and synergistic. It is an approach with potential to transform the way that
neuroscientists and psychologists conceptualize and study racism, helping to overcome some of the
obstacles that have prevented previous scientific investigation of personal experiences with racism.
Among our central aims is to increase the representation of a minoritized participant population that has
been historically undersampled in NIH-funded research, and to promote the training and career
advancement of underrepresented research trainees, consistent with NIH goals."

The growing prevalence of stimulant use disorder (StUD) in the US is a major public health
concern. As of 2020, 3.2M people had StUD in the US, which exceeds the 2.7M people with
opioid use disorder (OUD), and there were ~57K stimulant-related overdose deaths in 2021. In
fact, stimulants are considered the “4th wave” of the overdose crisis. In 2020, NIDA Director
Nora Volkow, MD stated that “although deaths from opioids continue to command the public’s
attention, an alarming increase in deaths involving the stimulant drugs methamphetamine and
cocaine are a stark illustration that we no longer face just an opioid crisis”. Despite substantial
R&D efforts, there is no FDA-approved pharmacotherapy for the treatment of StUD – in contrast
to OUD where medication-assisted treatment (MAT) is the standard of care – and there is an
urgent need for such.
This UG3/UH3 proposal aims to develop SBS-518 as a first-in-class treatment for StUD. SBS-
518 is a dual sigma receptor antagonist and dopamine active transport (DAT) inhibitor. We have
demonstrated that SBS-518 decreases stimulant self-administration in rats, without being
rewarding itself. These data support the development of SBS-518 as a novel, first-in-class
treatment for StUD.
In the UG3, we will conduct a targeted lead optimization to select our lead compound (SBS-
518x) and quickly move into development. We will conduct nonGMP API and drug product
development, nonGLP toxicology studies, and submit for a pre-IND meeting with FDA to align
on the IND-enabling program. By the end of the UG3, we will have our identified our clinical
candidate and conducted preliminary CMC and tox work. In the UH3, we will conduct the IND-
enabling CMC and toxicology work, submit an IND and conduct a Phase 1 clinical trial. In
summary, we propose to develop a novel agent for StUD and bring it through a first in human
clinical trial."

Hematological abnormalities, such as thrombocytopenia, anemia, lymphocytopenia, monocytopenia,
and neutropenia, frequently occur in patients infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-1.
Of note, Pancytopenia has been considered as the hallmark feature of patients with advanced
Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (Group IV). In addition, patients with HIV infection are
susceptible to HIV-associated opportunistic infections and bone marrow neoplasms. More
importantly, antiretroviral treatments result in incomplete rescue of hematopoiesis and are known to
impair normal hematopoiesis in patients with HIV infection. Emerging evidence establish a strong
link between HIV-1 and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) of the bone marrow. Overall, these studies
provide a compelling rationale for further investigations into mechanisms through which HIV-1
dysregulates hematopoiesis. However, the cellular mechanisms responsible for pancytopenia and
bone marrow failure following HIV-infection remain incompletely understood. More importantly, it
remains unclear if HIV infection is directly affecting the physiology and functions of HSCs. To this end,
the research proposed here aims to unravel the physiologic impact of HIV infection on HSCs and to
identify the progenitors that are susceptible to HIV infection.
The major hypothesis of this study is that HIV infection impairs HSC maintenance in the bone
marrow and their differentiation into myeloid, erythroid, and lymphoid lineages, which
ultimately results in immunodeficiencies. The rationale is that HIV infection alters the physiological
properties of HSCs, such as quiescence, self-renewal and multilineage differentiation, therefore
suppressing their vital functions. To test our hypothesis, we will use a combination of
xenotransplantation, in-vitro culture, molecular cell biology, biochemical and fluorescence correlation
spectroscopy studies. In the first specific aim, we would investigate the impact of HIV infection on
the physiology of HSCs. In the second specific aim, we would identify the HSPC subsets that are
susceptible to HIV-1 both in-vitro and in-vivo. Studies proposed in Aims 1 and 2 are complimentary
and informed by the data of each other, but not dependent on the outcome of the other Aim.
We believe that the proposed research will provide detailed insights into the mechanisms through
which HIV infection impairs HSC biology and causes hematopathology. Knowledge obtained from the
proposed research would be useful to design novel and more effective therapies for human
hematologic diseases that are caused by viral infections."
10879165,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The overdose (OD) crisis continues to devastate communities across North America. Despite 90% of paramedic-
attended ODs in British Columbia (BC), Canada being non-fatal, much of the research has focused on fatal ODs.
While men account for over 70% of fatal ODs, there is evidence of a more balanced distribution of men and
women experiencing non-fatal ODs (NFODs); further, women have higher mortality rates in the year following
an NFOD. People living with HIV (PLHIV) are disproportionately affected by the OD crisis and are at increased
risk of fatal ODs, yet little is known about the longer-term impacts of NFODs on PLHIV in terms of adverse health
outcomes and healthcare utilization (HCU). Considering the increasingly high rates of NFODs, gendered
differences in mortality following an NFOD, and knowledge gaps concerning health outcomes following an
NFOD, this proposal seeks funding to investigate the role of sex, gender, and HIV status in differential NFOD
outcomes. BC’s universal healthcare system and data centralization enabled the Comparative Outcomes And
Service Utilization Trends (COAST) Study, a population-based longitudinal cohort comprised of linked
administrative health datasets on all known adult PLHIV and a 10% random sample of the general population in
BC. Using COAST, we aim to: (1) Generate estimates for the incidence rates of fatal and nonfatal ODs among
people living with and without HIV (2012-2020) in BC; (2) Assess and compare changes in health care utilization,
chronic comorbidity, and mortality among people living with and without HIV who experienced an NFOD,
modified by sex and gender; and (3) Assess and compare changes in HIV treatment outcomes in people living
with HIV who experienced an NFOD, modified by sex and gender. This project will also involve the development
of a Community Advisory Board (CAB) for proposed and future projects. The CAB will provide guidance to
ensure research soundness and relevance to the community throughout the research and knowledge
mobilization processes. Our collaborative research will be an opportunity to explore other research possibilities
initiated by the CAB as important for women and gender minorities living with and without HIV who are affected
by the OD crisis. In response to the National Institute on Drug Abuse Notice of Special Interest NOT-DA-
21-021 to advance research specific to women and other underrepresented populations including gender
minorities, this proposal will inform future CAB-led cycles of inquiry and analysis amongst our team to answer
relevant research questions and address the identified needs of cisgender women and gender minorities living
with and without HIV affected by the OD crisis."
10873760,"1) Background, key gaps in our understanding, and important challenges to be addressed. In response to
injury, differentiated adult secretory cells in the gastrointestinal tract undergo metaplasia, or the conversion of
one cell type to another. In the pancreas, this is called `acinar to ductal metaplasia' (ADM) and it is thought to
function in tissue regeneration. The goals of our laboratory are to generate tools to understand the process of
ADM, to identify the consortium of ADM cell types that emerge, and to determine their physiological role in
tissue injury. 2) Description of recent progress by the PI. By the end of her post-doctoral work, the PI showed
that differentiated, secretory cell types, such as tuft cells, form in the pancreas in response to ADM (DelGiorno
et al. Frontiers in Physiology, 2020). Tuft cells are solitary chemosensory cells with myriad roles in mediating
inflammation. Combining RNA sequencing, electron microscopy (EM), and mouse models of disease, she
identified a functional role for tuft cells, the first description in any model of tumorigenesis (DelGiorno et al.
Gastroenterology, 2020). Using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and EM, she has identified the
formation of several additional secretory cell populations in ADM of unknown function, which are now being
studied in the DelGiorno laboratory. 3) Overview of future research program. We propose to continue our
work on ADM by creating a workflow combining Single cell RNA-seq and EM Analysis (SEMA) to study
epithelial heterogeneity in pancreatic injury with and without the genetic manipulation of identified cell types.
Volumetric electron microscopy (3DEM) will be used as a substrate on which to map the information provided
by scRNA-seq to reveal the spatial relationships between cells and infer the function of individual cell types
through the study of their organellar content. Our approach leverages scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to
conduct a variety of experiments on the same tissue including: [1] imaging of dehydrated whole-mount samples,
[2] wide-field “chip mapping” of large areas of ultrathin sections, and [3] large-scale serial section approaches
for 3DEM acquisition. Mapping is enhanced using correlative light and electron microscopy to assign molecular
markers identified in scRNA-seq by immunofluorescence to cells with defining characteristics in SEM (e.g.,
nuclear shape, distribution of mitochondria, etc). Our 3DEM datasets are amenable to high-throughput image
processing (e.g., segmentation, geometry processing) using machine learning and deep learning tool kits.
Together, these tools provide a novel discovery workflow, which will be applied to projects throughout our
laboratory aimed at evaluating cellular heterogeneity in ADM. Our goals for the next five years are to use this
SEMA approach to build a multi-dimensional atlas of the cellular content and spatial relationships of the
various emergent cell types in ADM. Mouse models lacking individual ADM cell subtypes will be used to
assess phenotypic effects on cellular makeup, relative positioning, and disease progression. Together, these
studies will provide invaluable insight into the role of ADM in tissue healing and regeneration in the pancreas."
10866349,"Hair cells of the auditory and vestibular systems signal sensory stimuli as graded changes in neurotransmitter
release and employ unique anatomical and molecular components that differ from conventional synapses.
Among the unique molecular features is the apparent lack of reliance on neuronal SNARE proteins and their
various partners. Instead, hair cell exocytosis depends on a large protein called Otoferlin, by unknown
mechanisms. In this proposal, we investigate the unique features of hair cell synaptic transmission using a
combination of molecular biology, electrophysiological approaches in zebrafish, and novel in vitro membrane
fusion assays. In Aim 1 we will determine whether Otoferlin can stimulate membrane fusion using well
established cell-cell fusion assays with engineered cells and determine the requirements for SNAREs, lipids
and calcium in otoferlin-dependent fusion. These experiments will also determine the functional domains
required to mediate membrane fusion. Importantly, this strategy avoids difficulties with purification of Otoferlin
that hindered advances in reconstituting Otoferlin-dependent fusion in the past. In Aim 2, we will measure the
calcium-dependent membrane binding properties of Otoferlin and look for Otoferlin-interacting partners in
native cells. In Aim 3, we use the zebrafish lateral line as a model system explore the role of SNAREs in hair
cell exocytosis. In Aim 4, we test the effectiveness of truncation mutants to rescue synaptic function.
Understanding hair cell synaptic function at the molecular level will ultimately aid in understanding how auditory
information is processed and communicated. Moreover, mutations in Otoferlin lead to DFNB9 form of inherited
deafness and thus study of its function has relevance for human disease. Otoferlin belongs to the ferlin class of
proteins, which include myoferlin and dysferlin, which are also implicated in membrane fusion and human
disease. It is reasonable to expect that what we learn in this project will be instructive for studies with other
ferlins. Lastly, the fundamental understanding of presynaptic processes in these specialized cells will have
broader implications for cellular communication in general and thus, may contribute to our understanding of
various aspects of mental health and neurological disorders."

10686205,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Vaginal colonization with a Lactobacillus-dominant microbial community is associated with lower risk for preterm
birth, HIV acquisition, HPV persistence and cervical dysplasia. A diverse, Lactobacillus-deficient vaginal
microbiota such as that seen in bacterial vaginosis (BV) is associated with mucosal inflammation, which is likely
the mechanistic link to the adverse health outcomes seen with dysbiosis. Antibiotic treatment for BV achieves
short term cure, but recurrence is common. Probiotic treatment to restore healthy lactobacilli is only moderately
successful, even with daily treatment. These results emphasize the need for novel strategies to manipulate the
genital microbiome and produce sustainable shifts away from dysbiosis. We propose a randomized clinical
trial of vaginal microbiota transplant (VMT) with extensive characterization of donors, transplant material,
recipients and engraftment, to identify determinants of vaginal microbial colonization and stability. Our team has
already obtained an IND, successfully recruited donors, and generated preliminary data demonstrating stability
of Lactobacillus in donated material. In Aim 1 we will enroll up to 25 healthy donors and 126 recipients with a
history of recurrent BV and an abnormal Nugent score. Recipients receive 1 week of oral metronidazole and are
randomized to VMT or saline placebo, two doses given on non-consecutive days in a single week. The primary
outcome is prevalence of a Lactobacillus-dominant vaginal microbiota by 16S rRNA sequencing 1 month after
intervention. Secondary outcomes include adverse events, Lactobacillus dominance over the entire 6 month
follow up, and prevalence of BV by Nugent score at 1, 3 & 6 months. In Aim 2 we will characterize the impact of
vaginal fluid transplantation on recipient microbiome (Aim 2.1) and mucosal inflammation (Aim 2.2). For Aim 2.1
we will use 16S rRNA sequencing, qPCR and shotgun metagenomic sequencing (SMS) to define the kinetics of
Lactobacillus colonization and community diversity over the 6 months following study intervention. In Aim 2.2 we
will assess the impact of VMT vs. placebo on soluble markers of inflammation in vaginal fluid and endocervical
immune cell activation. In Aim 3 we will identify genetic characteristics of both successful donations and
Lactobacillus isolates cultivated from successful VMT donors and recipients (Aim 3.1). We will compare isolates
in vitro to test functional metrics for future selection of strains for novel products (Aim 3.2). We will also compare
metabolic profiles of successful vs. unsuccessful donations (Aim 3.3). The resulting isolate collection and
database of genes and metabolites associated with achieving Lactobacillus dominance will provide a basis for
design of a novel live biotherapeutic for prevention of BV and its associated sequelae. Execution of these three
aims will also provide novel insights into determinants of vaginal Lactobacillus colonization and the causal
relationship between Lactobacillus and protection from BV, moving the field forward whether or not our trial
demonstrates a clinical benefit for VMT. Data obtained will provide guidance on what features are important for
designing a synthetic intervention, which would be easier to scale up for widespread use than VMT."
10906932,"Project Summary/Abstract
Combination treatments aiming to stimulate synergistic immune pathways employing cytokines or
immunomodulatory antibodies are generally more effective than monotherapies in preclinical models of cancer
immunotherapy. However when given systemically, these combination treatments suffer from high toxicity from
on-target off-tumor stimulation as well as low local concentrations at the tumor site due to poor tumor penetrance
and high clearance rates. Local intratumoral therapy is a viable approach to bypass some of the challenges
associated with systemic delivery, but requires optimization to promote retention of the therapeutic agent at the
injection site and minimize leakage into the circulation. We have recently developed an approach to enhance
vaccine efficacy by engineering the binding of immunogens to the commonly used adjuvant aluminum hydroxide
(alum) via a site-specific phosphoserine (pSer) peptide tag. The pSer moieties undergo a ligand-exchange
reaction with free hydroxyl groups on the surface of alum leading to stable anchoring of proteins on alum
particles. We propose here to apply this alum-anchoring platform in the context of cancer to retain potent immune
agonists within the tumor site, promoting a robust systemic immune response with minimal toxicity. Our
preliminary results show that this simple approach can be used to load stimulatory cytokines onto alum for
retention at the tumor site up to a month, stimulating a strong anti-tumor response from a single shot treatment.
We plan to develop and optimize this translational strategy through the following specific aims: (1) use in-cell
phosphorylation to produce phosphoserine-tagged cytokines and other candidate immune agonists for optimal
alum binding, (2) determine optimal treatment regimens for these intratumoral alum-bound therapeutic agents in
vivo in multiple tumor models, (3) define the mechanism of action through which this therapy elicits a response,
(4) evaluate the systemic immune response and assess strategies to enhance abscopal effects by promoting
the transfer of immunostimulatory payloads to motile lymphocytes for trafficking to distal untreated tumors.
These studies will establish a robust technology platform capable of safely delivering treatments currently viewed
as too toxic, by addressing key limitations in existing localized therapeutic strategies"
10908512,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading global cause of disability. A prominent feature of MDD is circadian
rhythm disturbances. Recent studies have shown gene expression (GE) rhythms in the human brain using a
“time of death” analysis of postmortem (PM) brain tissue, where GE data is organized across a 24-hour clock
based on individual time of death. Using this approach, it was previously shown that MDD subjects have
disrupted GE rhythms across a number of brain regions, including the striatum. The striatum is composed of the
dorsal striatum and ventral striatum and both have been implicated in stress, anhedonia, and depression. In
preliminary studies, the candidate characterized GE rhythms and phase relationships across the human dorsal
and ventral striatum. The mechanisms driving these rhythmic patterns of GE in the striatum and the alterations
observed in MDD remain to be investigated. This K01 proposal utilizes a multi-omics approach to investigate
DNA methylation (DNAm) as a potential epigenetic mechanism by which GE rhythms are altered in depression.
Given that (1) DNAm in the striatum is strongly implicated in depression and directly influenced by stress and (2)
DNAm rhythms are correlated and time-locked to GE rhythms in the human cortex, the central hypothesis is that
striatal GE rhythm disruptions in depression are driven by chronic-stress induced alterations in DNAm rhythms.
This hypothesis will be tested by the following aims: (1) Determine rhythmic changes in DNAm in the human PM
dorsal and ventral striatum in MDD subjects; (2) Employ a multi-omics data integration approach to determine
how rhythmic changes in DNAm affect transcriptome-wide rhythms in the human PM dorsal and ventral striatum
in MDD subjects; and (3) Determine the regulation of transcriptome-wide rhythms and anhedonia-like behavior
by DNAm in the dorsal and ventral striatum in a mouse model of chronic stress. These studies are central to
understanding the mechanisms underlying circadian disruptions in MDD and may result in the discovery of novel
therapeutic targets for future treatments. To complete the proposed studies and support his career goal of
establishing an independent laboratory to study the epigenetic mechanisms driving circadian rhythm disruptions
in depression, the candidate will require mentored training in: (1) developing conceptual and technical expertise
in the use of rodent models and human PM brain tissue to study the neurobiology of depression; (2) developing
conceptual and technical expertise in the field of epigenetics; and (3) learning advanced biostatistics and
bioinformatics skills to integrate circadian analyses of transcriptomics and epigenomics data. To achieve these
training goals, the candidate has assembled a mentorship team with extensive expertise in the neurobiology of
depression, epigenetics, and biostatistics. The Department of Psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh offers a
well-funded environment with exceptional career development opportunities to become a successful
independent investigator. At completion of this proposal, the candidate will be uniquely positioned to lead his
own research program studying the epigenetic mechanisms driving circadian rhythm disruptions in depression."

Candidate: Tessa M. Andermann, MD, MPH is a fellowship-trained Infectious Diseases specialist who has
been involved in patient-oriented research throughout her medical training. As an Assistant Professor of
Medicine at UNC, she has specific interests in translational research and is invested in precisely tracking the
development and dissemination of antibiotic resistant organisms in immunocompromised patients in order to
prevent untreatable infections. The specific training objectives for the proposed award include gaining
expertise in: 1) applying next-generation sequencing technologies to characterize antibiotic resistance genes in
gut flora, and 2) designing clinical studies to prevent infections with multidrug-resistant organisms in patients
with cancer. Her expert team of mentors include Drs. Jonathan Juliano, MD, and Anthony Fodor, PhD.
Environment: As one of the nation's premier research institutions, the University of North Carolina provides an
optimal environment for the proposed research. The Division of Infectious Diseases is home to a number of
extremely accomplished basic, clinical, and translational research scientists; within the Division, there is active
work investigating antimicrobial resistance that will provide Dr. Andermann ample guidance and leadership.
The UNC research community's collegial nature is demonstrated in the seamless incorporation of experts in
cancer, the gut microbiome, and microbial genomics with whom Tessa has developed the necessary
relationships to accomplish the proposed research. UNC, in kind, has demonstrated its support of Tessa's
research career by providing the salary support that allowed her to develop this current proposal.
Research: Patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) whose gut flora are colonized
with antibiotic-resistant bacteria have a higher frequency of bloodstream infections (BSI), and an increased
mortality. Despite the significant burden of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in this population, knowledge of how
antibiotic-resistant bacteria develop and disseminate in patients is limited. Prior studies in HCT recipients have
not yet investigated the acquisition and transfer of AMR genes within and between gut bacteria that may
contribute to infection. The overarching goal of the proposed research is to assess the impact of gut AMR gene
dynamics on the risk of systemic infections using novel sequencing technologies. The specific aims are to
determine: 1) the timing of AMR gene acquisition relative to transplant, 2) the extent of AMR gene transfer and
dissemination between bacteria in the gut, and 3) the relationship between AMR gene burden and BSI risk
after HCT. To accomplish this, next-generation sequencing will be performed on stool samples from 70 HCT
recipients at two different institutions. We hypothesize that the increased antibiotic resistance gene burden in
the gut resistome after transplant is due primarily to expansion of pre-transplant AMR genes and is associated
with an increased risk of BSI after HCT. We expect that this research will yield a greater understanding of how
antimicrobial resistance develops in gut bacteria that can be used to prevent infections in patients with cancer."

leveraging a long-standing collaboration between Moi University College of Health Sciences (Moi University
School of Public Health [MUSPH] and School of Medicine [MUSM]) in Kenya and the Academic Model
Providing Access to Healthcare (AMPATH) Consortium, a collaboration of North American and European
Universities led by Indiana University. The over-arching aim of this proposal is to create sustainable and
collaborative capacity for HIV Implementation Science and Dissemination (HIV-ID) both within academia and at
the county-level (equivalent to U.S. states). The primary aim is to build a sustainable educational infrastructure
to support training in HIV-ID in western Kenya. This will be achieved by enhancing existing degree programs
and supporting establishment of emerging degree programs at MUSPH. The second aim is to expand human
resource capacity in HIV-ID that promotes collaboration between academia and county health teams. This will
be accomplished by supporting training for 12 masters and two doctoral students, including six masters
students representing county health teams. The third aim is to support continuation of trainees in HIV-ID. This
will be accomplished by establishing a competitive post-graduate fellowship program to conduct research
embedded in county health teams and by training 5 post-graduate fellows within this program.
We will build research mentorship capacity at MUCHS by leveraging a collaboratively developed mentorship
training program and creating an environment where mentorship modeling and growth is promoted. We will
engage county health teams and county governments in the HIV-ID Program to address the vital need for their
collaboration with academics in order to tackle challenges within the HIV prevention and care cascades. This
will be addressed by strengthening existing relationships with the counties, supporting masters students from
the counties, opening program workshops to county health teams, and promoting research projects that
engage county health teams. We will promote reciprocal innovation, defined as the bidirectional, co-
constituted, and iterative exchange of ideas, resources, and innovations to address shared health challenges
across diverse global settings. This will be achieved by supporting collaborative Kenyan and North American
trainee mentorship and by creating and supporting a joint learning process for Kenyan and U.S. post-graduate
fellows.
By strengthening in-country educational infrastructure, expanding local human resource capacity in strategic
areas, promoting sustained engagement in research, enhancing mentorship capacity, and supporting research
collaboration with county health teams, this training program will build sustainable research capacity for HIV-ID
and promote decolonization of global health."
10914066,"Project Summary
The hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is the most serious complication of high-risk Shiga toxin-producing
Escherichia coli (STEC) infection and the most common cause of acquired acute kidney injury in otherwise
healthy children. HUS develops in up to 20% of children following STEC infection, 60% of whom require
temporary renal replacement therapy (RRT); an additional 50% develop serious extrarenal complications.
Although mortality from acute HUS is low (1-3%), it has remained constant for three decades and
approximately 30% of HUS survivors experience long-term sequelae, chiefly chronic kidney disease,
hypertension, and diabetes. There have been only three relatively small, randomized trials to prevent
progression to HUS and/or to reduce kidney injury once HUS is established; none have demonstrated benefits,
and none have been performed since 1999.
Recent cohort studies suggest that early intravascular volume expansion (hyperhydration) in STEC infected
children could be nephroprotective if and when HUS occurs. However, more evidence is needed before
hyperhydration supplants traditional ‘wait and see’ (i.e., conservative fluid management) reactive care
approaches which focus on outpatient care and minimizing intravenous fluid administration to avoid fluid
overload in children who do develop HUS. Here, we will confirm or refute the hypothesis that aggressive
volume expansion, administered early in STEC infected children, is associated with better renal outcomes and
fewer adverse events than conservative management by accomplishing three Specific Aims: (1) Determine
the effectiveness of hyperhydration in decreasing the prevalence of Major Adverse Kidney Events by 30
days (defined as death, RRT, or sustained loss of kidney function at 30 days) in STEC-infected
children versus conservative fluid management; (2) Determine the effectiveness and safety of
hyperhydration in decreasing HUS and life-threatening, extrarenal complications in STEC-infected
children versus conservative fluid management; (3) Create a biorepository that will be linked to our
clinical data to identify prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in STEC-infected children. To
accomplish these Aims, we will conduct an embedded, open-label, cluster-randomized crossover superiority
trial in 26 emergency departments. Participating sites, located in the United States and Canada, will be
randomly allocated to the order of protocol implementation (hyperhydration or conservative fluid management)
in this two-interval, two-intervention trial, developed with the support of an NIAID R34 grant. The design,
facilitated by rapid molecular enteric diagnostics, overcomes many barriers to studying this challenging disease
and maximizes the potential therapeutic benefits by embedding the intervention into routine clinical care. If we
confirm our hypothesis, this project will provide the first causal evidence of an effective, implementation-ready
intervention for children infected with high-risk STEC."

We have recently conducted and published a game changing phase 3 clinical North American Intergroup
(NAIG) trial (E1912) for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) therapy which tested a combination of Ibrutinib
and Rituximab (IR) vs. the prior gold standard chemoimmunotherapy (CIT): fludarabine, cyclophosphamide,
and rituximab (FCR). This trial showed that both progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) are
superior with IR and subsequently was the driving factor in FDA approval for frontline use of IR in progressive
previously untreated CLL in the spring of 2020. While our work revealed distinct clinical advantages to non-CIT
approaches, a number of new questions have emerged with respect to how best apply this advance.
The durability of the response to first-line ibrutinib-based therapy is highly variable and requires indefinite
treatment exposing patients to the risk of chronic toxicity and selective pressure that may foster resistant
clones. The ability to more accurately predict the durability of response could help identify patients more likely
to have long term remission with ibrutinib therapy (candidates for time limited therapy) and those more likely to
have a short duration of response whom may benefit from intensive combination therapy with alternative novel
agents. We wish to develop a unique model(s) incorporating multiple key prognostic factors that will have a
high level of confidence in predicting patient outcomes to novel therapy combination.
Our initial study on patients treated on IR arm of E1912 found a subset of patients on the IR arm with evidence
for emerging mutations and changes in their clonal architecture predicting relapse. The exact mechanisms for
relapse need to be defined as we predict that these patients will be difficult to treat and alternative strategies
needed. We found that IR therapy was uniquely able to reactivate the previously exhausted T cell killing activity
directed against the leukemic CLL cells. While we have some information on the mechanism(s) for this, much
remains to be learned and also the exact timing for achieving the maximal restoration of T cell function or
fitness. This beneficial impact on T cell function will also be studied as it relates to generation of CAR T cells as
these cells are powerful inducers of immunotherapy which is itself capable of removing residual CLL tumor
burden. We hypothesize that the outcome of the studies will add significant and important information on how
to best select non-chemotherapy for CLL patients and also the treatment impact on the immune system. These
goals will be accomplished through the following specific aims:
Aim 1: Develop an Integrated Model to Predict Clinical Outcomes for CLL Patients Treated with Novel Agents.
Aim 2: Determine the Genetic, Epigenetic and Transcriptomic Changes in Ibrutinib Treated CLL.
Aim 3: Characterize the Impact of Ibrutinib Treatment on T-cell Fitness to Guide Application of
Immunotherapy."
10912667,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Sepsis is a disorder that contributes to approximately 1 in 3 hospital deaths in the United States
and 1 in 5 deaths worldwide. Advancing sepsis management has been challenging in part due
to the heterogeneity of septic patients in demographics, comorbidities, infectious source,
microbiologic etiology, and level of organ dysfunction. Our group has previously identified sepsis
subclasses that differ in prognosis and response to treatment, suggesting that precision
medicine may improve sepsis care. Glucocorticoids (GCs) are commonly used in septic patients
despite inconsistent results from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and they are an ideal
candidate to develop a precision medicine approach. Recently, two of the largest RCTs ever
conducted to test efficacy of GCs in sepsis (APROCCHSS and ADRENAL) also demonstrated
conflicting results. Reconciling discordant results between trials has proved challenging with
traditional methods but may be facilitated by state-of-the-art computational approaches which
incorporate machine learning to estimate the conditional average treatment effect based on
individual covariate patterns. In this proposal, we will create a ‘knowledge network’ using clinical
and biologic data from 4 RCTs of GCs in sepsis (APROCCHSS, ADRENAL, ESCAPe,
HYPRESS) and electronic health record data (Sepsis Endotyping in Emergency Care project).
In Aim 1, we will utilize unsupervised and supervised learning approaches using clinical data
from RCTs to characterize heterogeneity of treatment effect, identify subclasses that benefit,
and develop a treatment policy to reduce 90-day mortality. In Aim 2, we will use causal
Bayesian modeling approaches that incorporate RCT and EHR data to identify effect modifiers
and confounders of GC therapy and mortality. We will use these results to develop a treatment
policy to reduce 90-day mortality. Secondary analyses will compare RCT-only policies in Aim 1
to RCT-EHR policies in Aim 2. In Aim 3, we will perform cytokine assays and RNAseq using
samples from the ADRENAL, ESCAPe, and HYPRESS trials to identify endotypes that benefit

computational biologists, and critical care specialists with an established track record of
collaboration for this proposal. Successful completion of our Aims will reconcile discordant
results of prior RCTs testing GCs in sepsis, develop a treatment policy that can be deployed in
EHRs, and improve design of future RCTs."
10764318,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Though stress is necessary for the adaptive survival of a species, stress exposure can also elicit maladaptive
physiological and behavioral responses. Stress-induced maladaptive responses may lead to subsequent
development of psychiatric disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive
disorder (MDD). A core symptom observed in these disorders is increased fear expression, as defined by
heightened fear responses in the presence of stimuli associated with fear. We have previously discovered that
a single injection of (R,S)-ketamine, a rapid-acting antidepressant, attenuates learned fear following contextual
fear conditioning (CFC). We and others have reported that the ventral hippocampus (vHPC), specifically
ventral CA3 (vCA3), mediates (R,S)-ketamine’s effects on attenuating learned fear. However, how exactly
(R,S)-ketamine modulates the ensembles in vCA3 to decrease fear generalization is yet to be explored. It has
additionally been shown that ventral CA1 (vCA1) contributes to fear behavior. Thus, this research plan will lay
the groundwork to uncover the effects of (R,S)-ketamine administration on fear behavior using of in vivo
microdialysis to complement and further explain the data already collected from in vivo Ca2+ imaging in vCA3
and vCA1. Overall, my goal for this proposal is to better understand how (R,S)-ketamine alters
neurotransmitters and neuronal ensembles to buffer against heightened fear expression. My preliminary
findings outlined in Aim 1 show that (R,S)-ketamine: 1) blunts responses to shocks during fear encoding
specifically in vCA3; 2) differentially affects activity in ventral hippocampal regions CA3 and CA1; and 3)
decreases correlated activity in the ventral hippocampus during both fear encoding and retrieval. Together,
these findings lead me to my hypothesis that there are distinct changes in neurotransmitter content
immediately following (R,S)-ketamine administration that are long-lasting and that blunt the experience of a
fearful stressor. However, to test this hypothesis, I need to utilize in vivo microdialysis as outlined in Aim 2 to
measure levels of glutamate, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and serotonin (5-HT) in vCA3 or vCA1 of
male and female mice to understand how they potentially mediate (R,S)-ketamine’s effects. To date, no
longitudinal studies utilizing in vivo Ca2+ imaging or in vivo microdialysis studies have yet been performed
investigating (R,S)-ketamine effects on fear behavior. In Aim 3, I describe a postdoctoral research direction to
accomplish my goal of understanding the biological substrates of stress resilience. I have gained experience in
behavior, in vivo techniques, cellular and molecular neuroscience, and microscopy. However, I have yet to
conduct techniques that manipulate circuits, or that probe the contribution of transcriptomic changes after drug
treatment or with stress. Thus, I plan to address these gaps in my knowledge by finding a post-doctoral
position that allows me to grow in these skills. In summary, this proposal will lead to the development of a
diverse skillset in order to become a successful independent researcher in the psychiatric field."

10911197,"PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY. Lung cancer is a disease of older adults, who make up the least studied
population of patients in cancer research. Evidence gaps persist in understanding the impact of newer treatments
such as immunotherapy on functional status, the ability to recover from disability (resiliency), and clinical
outcomes (e.g. symptom burden and treatment toxicity) among older adults. Current evidence indicates that the
majority of older adults with cancer prioritize maintaining functional independence (i.e. no disability) over survival.
Despite this common desire among older adults, disability in basic activities of daily living (ADLs), instrumental
activities of daily living (IADLs), and mobility is a common consequence of cancer treatment. Functional status
in terms of ADLs, IADLs, and mobility is often unmonitored throughout the treatment course. Among older adults
with lung cancer, poor physical capability and psychological symptoms such as anxiety and depression are
common and represent potentially modifiable risk factors to achieve resiliency rather than disability. Interventions
that focus on helping older adults enhance resiliency and prevent functional decline during treatment are urgently
needed. Therefore, the objective of this application is to test a novel supportive care intervention specifically
designed to enhance resiliency among older adults with advanced lung cancer. This supportive care intervention,
called Resiliency among Older Adults Receiving Lung Cancer Treatment (ROAR-LCT), is designed to help
patients engage in behavior change to preserve functional status, by optimizing a resilience response to cancer
treatment, and is delivered virtually to decrease treatment burden for older adults. The first aim of this proposal
is to conduct the ROAR-LCT pilot randomized clinical trial, comprising physical therapy plus relaxation versus
standard-of-care, to evaluate a) feasibility and b) the preliminary effect on functional status (primary outcome).
The second and third aims are to compare secondary outcome differences (physical capability and psychological
symptoms) and exploratory outcome differences (symptom burden and treatment toxicity) between the two study
groups. As a geriatric thoracic oncologist, my overall career goal is to become an independent physician-scientist
conducting research to understand the problem of disability following a lung cancer diagnosis and developing
empirically supported strategies to improve a resilience response and prevent disability among older adults. This
award and training proposal will provide the support to advance my knowledge of patient-reported functional
outcomes for older adults, implement this knowledge in the design of behavioral clinical trials, and share this
knowledge in new leadership roles. To help ensure the success of this application, I have developed relationships
with a distinguished mentorship team having expertise in behavioral interventions, cancer control, lung cancer,
and geriatrics. This award will provide me with the additional training and career development I need to become
an independent physician-scientist focused on cancer and aging and to achieve my long-term goal of becoming
an international leader in geriatric oncology and a role model and mentor for women in academic medicine."
10907749,"Abstract
Of the one million emergency department (ED) patients hospitalized with acute heart failure (AHF), loop
diuretics are the only IV treatment used over 80% of the time, although only with level of evidence C. Prior
studies have focused on the initial dose of IV diuretic and failed to find one strategy with maximal efficacy.
Diuretic dosing and response vary widely, leaving many patients inadequately treated. Some have a clinical
response to diuretic therapy resulting in symptom improvement and discharge from the hospital within 3-5
days. However, despite apparent symptom improvement, 50% of these patients experience no weight loss and
up to 50% leave the hospital with residual congestion. Patients with residual congestion and minimal weight
loss at hospital discharge experience a disproportionately high number of readmissions. Up to 20% of
hospitalized patients have a poor initial response to IV loop diuretics, and are considered diuretic “non-
responsive”. As a result of untreated fluid and sodium retention, worsening heart failure (WHF) occurs
frequently during their inpatient stay. Patients who develop WHF experience prolonged hospital lengths of stay
(LOS), increased mortality, and consume significantly more resources. There is an unmet need to individualize
diuretic therapy to improve decongestion and subsequently reduce adverse events. Yet, even knowing the
fundamental role of congestion in AHF, there is little consensus among clinicians about how to optimize
diuretic responsiveness. Despite multiple clinical trials aiming to clarify the ideal approach to loop diuretics in
the management of congestion, the appropriate selection of dose and route, as well as determination of
effectiveness of diuretic therapy remains largely empirical. A standardized, protocol-driven treatment pathway
for hospitalized patients started in the first two hours of ED evaluation and utilizing objective measures of
diuretic response is needed. This would maximize diuretic efficiency, facilitate quicker resolution of congestion,
avoid WHF and prolonged LOS, and reduce AHF readmissions. Our strong preliminary data suggests low
urine sodium predicts length of stay and outcomes after initial diuretic dosing in the outpatient and inpatient
setting, and can be used to titrate diuretics. Our preliminary use of spot urine sodium to titrate loop diuretic
doses and maximize response in inpatients with AHF has shown compelling improvements in congestion and
weight loss. We propose to begin this protocol in the ED and hypothesize it will improve AHF outcomes relative
to structured guideline-based usual care. Specifically, we hypothesize use of spot urine guided diuretic therapy
will: 1) result in significant improvement in global clinical status at 5 days relative to structured guideline-based
usual care, and 2) result in significant improvement in congestion at 5 days and in global rank at 30 days
relative to structured guideline-based usual care. Early protocolized treatment of patients with AHF will more
rapidly improve dyspnea, avoid development of in-hospital WHF, result in greater decongestion at hospital
discharge, and therefore prevent HF-related readmissions and CV death."
10694976,"This application plans to develop a program, Symptom Monitoring & Systematic Assessment and
Reporting System in Young Survivors (SyMon-SAYS), to enable timely mitigation and management of
unrelieved symptoms for children with cancer. The SyMon-SAYS will administer, score, interpret and display
the results of symptom assessments in “real-time” between clinic visits in cancer care ambulatory settings,
when patients are likely to be more symptomatic. We hypothesize that this system can facilitate prompt
identification of problematic symptoms; consequently, with the availability of graphical symptom reports over
time, timely providers’ clinical care, and an informative symptom management booklet, patients will become
informed about their condition and take an active role in treatment, which will further improve self-management
skills. Better self-management promotes adherence to treatment plans, builds individual capacity, improves
interaction between patients and caregivers, reduces the use of medical specialists, and optimizes clinical
outcomes across the lifespan throughout the treatment and disease continua. The proposed waitlist control
randomized trial is based on our preliminary study testing the feasibility of the patient-centered SyMon-SAYS in
a pediatric oncology clinic. Results showed that the SyMon-SAYS was acceptable to patients/parents and they
were willing to use it during their routine clinical care. Clinicians expressed interest in receiving reports yet
preferred to review them in the medical record. Based on what we learned from this pilot, we now propose to
integrate the SyMon-SAYS system into the electronic health record (EHR), to streamline the alert notification
with clinician workflow by using EHR (Epic) messaging, and to include a broader range of symptoms. Patients
and parents will complete the weekly symptom assessment and review the symptom report by logging into the
Epic MyChart patient portal. Instead of using a standalone SyMon-SAYS app, we will align the SyMon-SAYS
program with the Epic EHR. We plan to conduct a single institution modified waitlist control randomized trial of
200 children (ages 8-17) with cancer over 16 weeks (Group A: 16-week SyMon-SAYS intervention; Group B:
8-week usual care and then 8-week SyMon-SAYS intervention) to achieve the following specific aims: 1)
evaluate effectiveness of SyMon-SAYS at week-8 and its maintenance effects at week-16. We hypothesize
that Group A (versus Group B) will report decreased parent-perceived barriers to managing their children’s
symptoms, decreased patient symptom burden, increased patient and parent self-efficacy, and ultimately
increased patient HRQOL at week-8 and no significant differences between Groups A & B at week-16; 2)
evaluate influential factors to Aim 1, including contextual patient and parent factors, adherence to the SyMon-
SAYS intervention, and symptom communication; and 3) evaluate predictors of adherence to the SyMon-SAYS
intervention and preference of SyMon-SAYS versus usual care."
10909950,"This K08 proposal describes a 5-year research training program that will prepare the candidate for a career as
an independent, NIH-funded translational scientist focused on mechanisms driving sepsis-mediated vascular
disease. The scientific premise for the aims is that vascular endothelial dysfunction is a key driver of organ injury
in pediatric sepsis. Morbidity and mortality remain unacceptably high in pediatric sepsis despite advances in
modern medicine, principally due to knowledge gaps in the mechanisms driving vascular disease during sepsis.
Endothelial cell-derived angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) has emerged as a critical promoter of vascular injury and organ
impairment in sepsis through its antagonism of the endothelial Tie2 receptor. Plasma Ang-2 levels are
significantly elevated in children with sepsis and are associated with measures of organ injury and outcomes.
Preliminary data suggest that heparan sulfate cleavage from the surface glycocalyx of flow conditioned primary
human lung microvascular endothelial cells promotes Ang-2 expression, implicating a novel paradigm by which
Ang-2 is upregulated in sepsis. Preliminary data and prior work also suggest that inactivation of liver kinase B1
(LKB1) and downstream adenosine-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) may be integral in this
process. Further, the candidate discovered that Ang-2 is bound to the surface of exosomes isolated from plasma
of septic children, suggesting that exosomal Ang-2 may significantly contribute to vascular disease and organ
injury during sepsis. Together, these data support the novel mechanistic hypothesis that enzymatic heparan
sulfate erosion from the endothelial glycocalyx during pediatric sepsis upregulates expression of Ang-2 that,
when bound to exosomes, has potent vascular destabilizing effects. To test this hypothesis, in vitro, ex vivo, and
clinical studies will be performed in the following two aims. Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that glycocalyx heparan
sulfate erosion increases Ang-2 expression from flow conditioned human lung microvascular endothelial cells
via attenuated LKB1 activity and downstream AMPK pathway signaling. Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that
exosomal Ang-2 (a) is biomarker for organ injury and clinical outcomes in pediatric sepsis and (b) promotes
endothelial permeability via Tie2 receptor antagonism. Harnessing the combined expertise of the candidate’s
mentoring team and utilizing the wealth of resources available at the candidate’s institution, the candidate will
train in advanced translational science techniques germane to the completion of these aims, including
microvascular flow modeling, nanoparticle tracking analysis and characterization with flow cytometry, and electric
cell-substrate impedance sensing. The proposed research program has defined benchmarks that will facilitate
the candidate’s career advancement and will culminate in the submission of an R01 to continue uncovering the
mechanisms driving vascular disease in pediatric sepsis that will foster the discovery of novel therapeutics."
10918092,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Trauma to the central nervous system (CNS: spinal cord and brain) together affect more than 2.5 million people
per year in the US, with economic costs of $80 billion in healthcare and loss-of-productivity. Yet, the precise
pathophysiological processes impairing recovery remain poorly understood. This lack of knowledge is
exacerbated by poor reproducibility of findings in animal models and limits translation of therapeutics across
species and into humans. Part of the problem is that neurotrauma is intrinsically complex, involving
heterogeneous damage to the central nervous system (CNS), by far the most complex organ system in the body.
This results in a multifaceted CNS syndrome reflected across heterogeneous endpoints and multiple scales of
analysis. Multi-scale heterogeneity makes traumatic brain injury (TBI) and spinal cord injury (SCI) difficult to
understand using traditional analytical approaches that focus on a single endpoint for testing therapeutic efficacy.
Single endpoint-testing provides a narrow window into the complex system of changes that describe SCI and
TBI. Understanding these disorders involves managing datasets that include high volume anatomy data, high
velocity physiology decision-support data, the high variety functional/behavioral data, and assessing correlations
among these endpoints. In this sense, neurotrauma is fundamentally a data management problem that involves
the classic ‘3Vs of big data’ (volume, velocity, variety). Of these, variety is perhaps the greatest data challenge
in neurotrauma research for reproducibility in basic discovery, cross-species translation, and ultimately clinical
implementation. For the proposed Data Repositories Cooperative Agreement (U24) we will build on our prior
work managing data variety in the Open Data Commons for SCI (odc-sci.org) and TBI (odc-tbi.org) to make
neurotrauma data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR). The milestone-driven aims will: 1)
further develop and harden our data lifecycle management system with end-to-end data version control and
provenance tracking, data certification, and data citation; 2) develop in-cloud data dashboards and visualizations
to monitor data quality and to promote data reuse, exploration, and hypothesis generation; 3) establish a pan-
neurotrauma (PANORAUMA) data commons that brings together separate data assets currently supported by
our multi-PI (MPI) team by aligning a patchwork of governance structures and policies. The goal of the proposed
project is to develop a pooled repository for preclinical discovery, reproducibility testing, and translational
discovery both within and across neurotrauma types. Our team is well-positioned to execute this project given
that we developed some of the largest multicenter, multispecies neurotrauma data repositories of neurotrauma
to-date (N>10,000 subjects 20,000 curated variables); the Neuroscience Information Framework (NIF); data
terminologies and standards for these fields (MIASCI, NIFSTD); and policy work with the International
Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility (INCF). The PANORAUMA cooperative agreement is highly responsive
to PAR-20-089, leveraging early successes in SCI and TBI data sharing to improve quality and sustainability."
10904921,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Pediatric sepsis is a major global public health problem associated with millions of deaths every year. However,
the current criteria to diagnose pediatric sepsis are outdated, lack specificity, do not allow early detection and
risk stratification in all settings, and are discordant with clinician-based diagnosis. In 2016, the adult Sepsis-3
task force redefined sepsis as “life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to
infection,” emphasizing the pivotal role of organ dysfunction in the pathophysiology of sepsis. Importantly, they
used a data-driven approach. The adult Sepsis-3 criteria, however, have been criticized for their limited
applicability outside the intensive care unit and in resource-limited settings. The pediatric criteria are still based
on the systemic inflammatory response syndrome and unvalidated organ dysfunction criteria. In 2019, the
Society of Critical Care Medicine and other major global organizations sponsored the creation of the Pediatric
Sepsis Definition Task Force to update the definition and operational criteria for pediatric sepsis. The overall
objective of this proposal is to derive and validate novel pediatric sepsis criteria that generalize beyond
the ICU and to differently resourced settings. The new criteria will be based on measures of organ
dysfunction. However, it remains unknown which organ dysfunction measures are optimal for the new pediatric
sepsis criteria. Furthermore, there is currently no pediatric emergency and inpatient database with the
granularity and broad representation needed to derive and validate the new sepsis criteria. In this proposal, we
will address these critical gaps to advance the science and clinical care of pediatric sepsis. We will extend our
prior work and leverage the expertise of our international investigative team to build a large, centralized
electronic health record database of pediatric emergency and inpatient care from institutions in both
high-income countries and low- and middle-income countries. We will use these rich clinical data to accomplish
the following aims: 1) determine the optimal clinical criteria for each pediatric organ dysfunction in differently
resourced settings and care environments, 2) develop and validate novel pediatric sepsis criteria, and 3) design,
build, and evaluate prototype CDS tools to facilitate use of the new pediatric sepsis criteria. We have assembled
an investigative team with a successful track record in the field and will work in partnership with the Pediatric
Sepsis Definition Task Force to address this global health priority. We expect the results of this proposal to have
a powerful and sustained impact on the science of pediatric sepsis and organ dysfunction and ultimately
improve sepsis recognition, accelerate appropriate effective treatment, decrease unnecessary treatment, and
improve the outcomes of children with sepsis around the world."

With more than 300,000 new cases of Lyme disease each year in the U.S., approximately half of new cases
occur in children. Children with Lyme meningitis, a clinical manifestation of Lyme disease, present with
headache, fever and fatigue. Previously, an intravenous antibiotic (ceftriaxone) was the recommended first
treatment for Lyme meningitis, but it is associated with a high rate of complications related either to the long-
term intravenous catheter placed for medication delivery or to complications from the medicine itself. Based on
European trials conducted in adults and small observational pediatric studies, some clinicians have begun
treating Lyme meningitis in children with an oral antibiotic (doxycycline), avoiding the complications associated
with intravenous ceftriaxone and reducing health care costs.
Our first goal is to compare oral doxycycline to intravenous ceftriaxone for the treatment of Lyme meningitis,
with a focus on both short-term recovery and long-term quality of life. Our second goal is to examine patient,
parent and clinician preferences to inform shared decision-making about Lyme meningitis treatments.
To accomplish our goals, we propose a comprehensive pediatric Lyme meningitis study, enrolling children at
20 U.S. centers located in regions of the U.S. where Lyme disease is endemic. Treatment decisions will be
made by the child’s doctors, per usual practice, and we will obtain informed consent to follow the outcomes
over the following six months. We will enroll a total of 210 children with Lyme meningitis to determine whether
oral doxycycline is not inferior to intravenous ceftriaxone for the treatment of Lyme meningitis in children. We
will interview patients, parents and clinicians to gain a nuanced understanding of the factors that shape
treatment decisions. The overall impact of this study will be to inform the best practices for the treatment of
children with Lyme meningitis accounting for the preferences of key stake holders."
10929342,"Project Summary/Abstract
Animal development consists of complex cell coordination and rearrangement via intercellular communications.
It is not well understood how progenitor cells interpret neighbor cell signals that impact cell fate decisions. One
critical signaling element in animal development is morphogen signaling. Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)
acts as a morphogen to pattern the dorsoventral (DV) axis during vertebrate development, where BMP
concentration gradients correlate with different cell identities. To study the mechanism in which progenitors
interpret BMP gradients, I look to zebrafish development. Zebrafish are transparent during embryonic and
larval stages, facilitating high resolution microscopy of cell fate change and migration patterns. Zebrafish share
more than 70% of their genes with humans, making them excellent models for human development and
disease research. Using zebrafish embryos, I will manipulate BMP concentration, progenitor cell location, and
BMP signal duration within mesodermal progenitors and determine the morphogenetic outcome. In Aim 1 of
this project, I will investigate the mechanism in which BMP signal coordinates its migration and cell fate gene
expression that results in its characteristic morphogenetic output. With DV BMP morphogenetic signaling, cells
may be positioned in embryonic domains where the microenvironment affects a binary fate switch. To answer
my question, I will be using transgenic embryos to conditionally overexpress ectopic BMP signal. Transplanting
transgenic cells into wildtype (WT) embryos prior to gastrulation stages will allow for the analysis of transgenic
cell fate decisions within the WT environment. I will analyze time lapses of developing embryos containing
these transgenic cells using spinning disk confocal microscopy. Cell fates will be genetically assessed using in
situ hybridization and fate-specific fluorescent probes before, during and after gastrulation. In Aim 2, I will be
determining the role that BMP signal duration has on cell fate decisions. I will be utilizing the Auxin Inducible
Degron (AID) system to create specific durations of BMP signaling and BMP target gene expression in order to
determine how signal duration impacts fate. Because a direct BMP target protein inhibits the transcription of
cell fate specific transcription factors, I hypothesize that the duration of BMP signaling would change the
amount of time that this target gene is present, allowing cell fate genes to bind when they normally would not
be able to, thus altering cell fates. The combined use of cell autonomous reporter fish lines, transplantation,
gene expression analysis, transgenic fish utilizing the AID system, and spinning disk confocal microscopy will
allow me to test my hypotheses."

The goal of this F31 fellowship application is to support and promote the training of Cindy R. Hu, currently a
pre-doctoral student in the Department of Environmental Health of the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health
and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at Harvard University. Her long-term research interests focus on
the associations of multiple environmental exposures on sleep. Ms. Hu has assembled a group of leading
experts as her Sponsors and Co-Sponsors including Drs. Jaime Hart, Brent Coull, Peter James, and Susan
Redline. Sleep is an important component of human health; it is a process that serves key functions in cognition,
performance, physiological repair, and recovery. Inadequate sleep has been linked to many physical health
outcomes like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity, as well as mental health outcomes such as anxiety
and depression. A nation-wide analysis showed an uneven geographic distribution of insufficient sleep across
the US; this geographic variability may be explained by a confluence of social and environmental determinants
of health. Environmental exposures that shape one’s sleeping environment as well as exposures that are
experienced during wake can impact sleep health. Of particular interest due to their modifiability are built
environment factors, such as light at night, neighborhood greenspace, and walkability have been shown to
affect sleep. Currently, environmental epidemiological studies of sleep often rely on self-reported measures of
sleep. The development of mobile health technologies provides an opportunity to quantitatively measure sleep
in ecologically valid and free-living (i.e. non-laboratory) conditions on a larger scale, but requires validation
against research standards. In addition to quantitative assessments of sleep, mobile health data can provide
rich information on GPS location and behaviors like physical activity, which allow for investigation of
mechanisms that link environmental exposures to sleep. Another key aspect of furthering our understanding of
how the environment impacts sleep is the utilization of an exposomic framework; to our knowledge, no study
has examined the effects of multiple exposures on sleep. Using the unique resources of the Nurses’ Health
Study 3 (NHS3) longitudinal cohort, Ms. Hu will receive extensive training in multiple aspects of exploring the
impacts of the environment on sleep, ranging from how to compare objective measures from multiple sources
(Aim 1), using mobile health panel studies to examine associations between features of the built environment
on sleep outcomes (Aim 2), and how to scale these insights to a full cohort of US women and men (Aim 3). This
will position her to be a future leader in the field of the environment and sleep through high-quality mentorship
and extensive professional development opportunities."

Adolescence is a time of increased risk and reward seeking behaviors, and 74% of adults with a substance use
disorder initiated use by 17 years of age, with many drugs of abuse acting through the dopamine (DA) system.
This makes understanding DA system development in adolescence of great importance to uncover the etiology
substance use disorders. In the rat, adolescence is a critical window of circuit refinement in the nucleus
accumbens (NAc), a dopamine (DA) rich brain region associated with reward. Microglia, the resident immune
cell of the brain, not only provides neuroimmune support but prunes synapses and receptors. We recently
demonstrated in rats that dopamine d1 receptor (D1r) peaks in adolescence and declines into adulthood, and
this decline occurs via a microglial-dependent phagocytic mechanism in males but not females. Importantly, this
downregulation of D1r in the NAc mediates termination of adolescent social play behavior in males. It is not
known what regulates microglial pruning behavior in the NAc. It is known that microglia phagocytosis across
brain regions due to chromatin remodeling altering transcriptional accessibility of required genes. Moreover,
microglial phagocytosis of synapses has been demonstrated to be dependent on neuronal activity. My central
hypothesis is that NAc microglial chromatin reorganization throughout adolescent development regulates
genomic accessibility and expression of phagocytic genes, mediating D1r phagocytosis directing social behavior
in males. I predict this occurs in a DA activity-dependent manner. To test these hypotheses, in Aim 1 I will
characterize genomic accessibility and gene expression with microglia, correlating phagocytic gene accessibility
expression through across adolescent development. This will provide a novel baseline characterization of
microglia through development and between sexes, potentially identifying sensitive periods of dynamic gene
regulation. In Aim 2 I will determine if dopaminergic signaling to the NAc is required for typical microglial
phagocytic activity and chromatin organization, impacting social behavior. This will demonstrate whether
microglial pruning of dopamine receptors during adolescence is dependent on neuronal activity and has
consequences for behavior. Collectively these data allows for powerful future directions investigating effects of
drugs of abuse on microglial development and function"
10796822,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Lymphocyte entry into lymph nodes (LNs) from blood is a key homeostatic process for efficient initiation of an
adaptive immune response to pathogens. Naïve B and T cells traffic through LNs to scan for foreign antigens
delivered to and concentrated in these organs from diverse sites of potential infection. If no antigens are
encountered, lymphocytes exit LNs into lymphatic circulation before returning to the blood and beginning the
cycle again. This constant lymphocyte recirculation requires large scale extravasation into lymphoid tissue under
non-inflammatory conditions, and the specialized vessels supporting this process in LNs are called high
endothelial venules (HEVs). HEVs express and luminally present several vascular ‘addressins’ and chemokines
that together support a multi-step adhesion cascade for lymphocyte entry into LNs. The signals promoting
lymphocyte arrest on HEV walls are well-elucidated, but the chemoattractants driving transmigration across the
endothelium are not fully understood. Elucidating the ligands and receptors that mediate this fundamental step
of entry is essential for understanding and manipulating immune cell trafficking in diseases such as cancer and
autoimmunity. The enzyme Ch25h, which produces 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC) from cholesterol, is highly
and selectively expressed in HEVs compared to capillary endothelium in LNs. Furthermore, Cyp7b1, which
hydroxylates 25HC to generate 7𝛼𝛼,25-dihydroxycholesterol (7,25HC), is expressed in stromal cells surrounding
LN HEVs. 7,25HC is a potent ligand for EBI2, a GPCR that helps guide activated B cell movement within LNs
and is also highly expressed in naïve B and T cells. The capability for oxysterol synthesis by HEVs suggests
EBI2 and 7,25HC may play a role in mediating lymphocyte entry into LNs. We hypothesize that a gradient of
7,25HC across HEVs supports post-adhesion transendothelial migration of naïve B and T cells. In preliminary
studies, EBI2 KO B cells and CD4 T cells displayed a recruitment defect to LNs in adoptive transfers, and a
similar homing defect was evident in mice lacking Ch25h or Cyp7b1. Furthermore, dependency on EBI2 for
lymphocyte entry into LNs increased in a viral infection setting. We hypothesize this is due to elevated 7,25HC
levels and reduced chemokine levels in inflamed LNs. From these results, we aim to determine the step of LN
entry that EBI2 directs via a combination of in vivo homing assays, intravital imaging, and in vitro migration
assays (Aim 1). In addition, we will examine EBI2’s role in maintaining lymphocyte homing in inflamed LNs by
characterizing the changes, and signals mediating these changes, in LN oxysterol and chemokine levels during
infection (Aim 2). Overall, this work will define a novel chemoattractant driving lymphocyte migration into LNs
and advance our understanding of the transmigration process. As well as their role in LNs, HEVs form in tumor
associated tertiary lymphoid tissues and at sites of chronic inflammation. Our findings could inform development
of novel therapeutics that modulate lymphocyte infiltration in these disease settings."

water supplies, the maximum contaminant level was recently reduced and enforced beginning in the early
2000s. Rural populations, however, rely on private wells which are not regulated for contaminants and may
contain higher levels of wAs found in groundwater. Exposure to As has been linked to systemic inflammation
and endothelial dysfunction, as well as kidney damage. A limited but growing body of evidence suggests that
low-to-moderate levels of wAs present in the US increases the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes,
including stroke and myocardial infarction. Few epidemiologic studies have evaluated the association between
wAs and chronic kidney disease (CKD), a prevalent disease found at higher rates of unknown cause in some
rural regions of California. Another drinking water contaminant, uranium (wU), which naturally occurs in
groundwater, shares similar toxicologic properties to wAs and is particularly nephrotoxic. Given wU may co-
occur with wAs, exposure to elevated levels of both contaminants may exacerbate the risk of CVD and CKD. In
collaboration with the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, a geospatial dataset of
annual wAs and wU levels (1990-2020) has been developed using measurements from community water
supplies and private wells, and spatially allocated to water system boundaries and private groundwater grids
(1x1 mile grids), respectively. Our study proposes to first evaluate spatiotemporal trends and the co-
occurrence of wAs and wU in community water supplies and private wells across California. We will leverage
the geospatial dataset to estimate long-term residential drinking water levels of wAs and wU for participants in
the California Teachers Study cohort (enrolled in 1995-96). We will conduct two epidemiologic studies
evaluating the association between exposure to wAs and the prospective risks of CVD (including stroke and
acute myocardial infarction) and CKD (stage 3 CKD to end stage renal disease) incidence/mortality. We will
assess whether risk is greater for participants with the highest exposure levels of both wAs and wU. In
summary, our study will describe trends in wAs and wU over time for both public and private water sources,
identify regions in California with elevated exposure, as well as contribute to limited knowledge about exposure
to low-to-moderate wAs levels and joint exposure to wU and the risks of CVD and CKD in the US."

Novel neuroimmune disorders defined by the presence of autoantibodies in plasma and/or CSF have recently
been discovered, most often first described in the context of paraneoplastic syndromes, only later to be also
found unassociated with tumors. These include limbic encephalitis (e.g., anti-NMDAR, anti-AMPAR, anti-
GABABR, anti-LGI1, anti-CASPR2), cerebellar ataxias (e.g., anti-Yo, anti-DNER, anti-GAD), stiff-person
syndrome (anti-GAD, anti-amphiphysin, anti-GlyR) and others (anti-Hu). Although little is known regarding the
pathophysiology of these disorders, some are believed to be more B-cell or T-cell mediated, hypotheses mostly
suggested by observed therapeutic responses and the surface/intracellular nature of antigens. Involvement of
KIR and HLA is unexplored in these disorders. Intriguingly, our preliminary data support a strong Genome-Wide
Association Study (GWAS) significant association of anti-NMDAR encephalitis with activatory KIR2DS1, the
strongest KIR association ever reported, suggesting KIR-NK cell axis to be a key regulator for these disorders.
We propose to conduct a genetic survey of the HLA and KIR repertoires in these diseases. Our specific aims 1
and 2, we will do a detailed characterization of symptoms and collect serum and DNA on 2000 cases (~1000
cases already collected). Our specific aim 3 will leverage state of the art advances in KIR and HLA next-
generation sequencing to perform high resolution genotyping in cases and controls, in addition, we will also
perform genome-wide single nucleotide typing in all cases and controls which will guide our association analysis.
In our specific aim 4, we will perform association analyses of the genome wide genotyping, compare frequencies
of HLA and KIR alleles in cases and controls. In our specific aim 5, any disorder with KIR and/or HLA finding(s)
we will conduct KIR-HLA interaction analyses focusing on KIR with known HLA ligands. This will involve
comparing frequencies of interacting KIR-HLA ligand pairs in cases versus controls; further, we will correlate
KIR/HLA findings with disease severity or symptom clusters. The study of these disorders will benefit neurology,
neuroimmunology, cancer, and infectious disease work. The fact these disorders are occurring in the setting of
heightened tumor immunity is notable and relevant to cancer immunotherapy, a growing area. These datasets
will be made available through ImmPort, which will allow countless researchers to prioritize basic studies of B
cells, T and NK cells in these disorders and associated tumors."

The broad goals of this Core are to provide facilities for vision scientists at Columbia University. Resources are
provided for imaging, histology and electroretinographic recording. The module is administered so as to ensure
equipment access, technical support and personnel training. The availability of shared state-of-the-art equipment
and facilities operated by trained and highly qualified technicians with oversight by vision faculty substantially
increases the quality and quantity of achievements earned by research programs. Productive functioning of
these core facilities will i) facilitate collaborative efforts; ii) enable the tackling of gaps in our knowledge that
require multiple areas of expertise; enhance the productivity of ongoing research making research funds more
profitable; and enable the development of new research strategies. The clustering of clinically applicable
instruments with in the Core enhances interactions between research and clinical faculty and encourages
translational research. The availability of the resources of the Core is also an advantage when recruiting new
faculty.
The core provides training for students and postdoctoral associates in in vivo eye imaging using modalities of
short-wavelength fundus autofluorescence, near-infrared fundus autofluorescence and optical coherence
tomography (OCT). Training in tissue processing and sectioning for histological analysis is also made available
as is training in electroretinographic (ERG) recording of visual function.
The Core supports a clinical grade animal-dedicated confocal laser scanning ophthalmoscope (Heidelberg)
equipped for short-wavelength fundus autofluorescence (AF), near-infrared fundus autofluorescence,
angiography and spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). Two new high resolution Bioptigen
SD-OCT (Envisu R2210 and R4310) enable non-contact in vivo SD-OCT imaging of the eye in animal models.
This capability will advance investigations of cornea, tear film, lens, glaucoma and retinal structure in both the
diseased and healthy eye. The instruments enable the study of animal models of disease in parallel with human
subjects research.
The core maintains 3 instruments for ERG testing. These machines are used to test the function of retinal
pigment epithelium (bleach protocol, c-wave), photoreceptors (scotopic and photopic serial intensities), and
retinal ganglion cells in rodents.
Skilled personnel under the direction of Dr. Sparrow manage day to day activities including training in the use of
the instruments. Reserving and tracking of usage time and scheduling of maintenance together with other day-
to-day activities are managed by iLAB software."

Project/Summary Abstract
The UAB NEI P30 Administrative Core performs an essential function in overseeing the overall activity of the
scientific Cores, and making sure that funds are appropriately utilized to support the highest quality science in
a diverse range of vision disciplines. Another major role of this Core, in conjunction with the efforts of the UAB
University Wide Interdiciplinary Research Center’s (UWIRC) Vision Science Research Center (VSRC), is to
promote and actively foster new collaboration, and to provide support and guidance to new and less
established investigators to develop and strengthen their research programs. Both the Core Director/PI, Dr.
Samuels and Co-Director/Co-PI, Dr. Pittler are NEI R01 supported and maintain active and productive labs.
Their combined expertise in diverse areas of vision research, and strong working relationship, makes them an
excellent team to lead the P30 grant. They will receive at least bi-annual input from an advisory committee
comprised of internal and external experts with a history of NEI P30 and/or NEI R01 funding. They will seek
additional input from UAB P30 participants and others in a monthly open forum of all UAB vision scientists that
precedes Vision Research at UAB Seminars. Additionally, the quality of Core- provided resources and services
is measured by focused surveys, town-hall style meetings, and through interaction with faculty at faculty
meetings and retreats. Continued support for one staff personnel with more than a decade of administrative
experience is requested to facilitate day-to-day operations such as ordering supplies, maintaining compliance
and budgets, coordinating repairs if needed and assisting with document preparation and record keeping. Due
to strong institutional support, grant management/secretarial/business officer support costs represent less than
5% of the total budget each year. The Administrative Core has an essential role in maintaining and
coordinating P30 activities and keeping the Cores running smoothly and effectively."

Project/Summary Abstract
The Molecular & Cellular Analysis Core was approved as a molecular biology/histology core and has been an
active and critical core for many Core participants for more than 15 years. Core participants in the current cycle
have demonstrated outstanding productivity publishing 178 papers (an 11% increase over the previous cycle).
For the proposed funding cycle, of the 14 moderate or extensive use Core participants, 12 are NEI R01-funded
(86%) and the other two are actively seeking new NEI R01-funding or have other NEI support. Three of the
four limited use Core participants proposed have NEI R01-funding and the other one has funding from other
vision support sources. The core has continued to evolve to meet user needs warranting several core
enhancements. Major institutional support has allowed the purchase of new equipment or the upgrade of some
of the key Core equipment to help meet user needs by providing the most up to date equipment. The focus for
this cycle was to enhance the capabilities of microscopic analysis through major update of a wide-field
microscope and addition of an advanced analysis software suite. The Core encompasses protein and nucleic
acid analysis, histology, and now advanced microscopy imaging and analysis. Dr. Pittler, the Core Director is
an expert in cell and molecular biology, and biochemistry focusing on animal models of retinal degeneration
and will continue as the Core Director. Dr. Marina Gorbatyuk, an expert in AAV technology and the study of the
unfolded protein response in animal models will continue as the Associate Director to assist with Core
governance and metrics analysis. In addition to having advanced equipment for analysis, the Core has a highly
educated, well-trained PhD scientist, Dr. Jose Luis Roig as the Laboratory Director. His broad knowledge and
experience base and overall scientific skill is a major asset. The Core equipment is primarily housed in
dedicated space in close proximity to most users and is accessible 24/7. Conflicts in usage scheduling is
minimized through a comprehensive online scheduler for all major equipment. Outstanding institutional support
has been critical in many ways: (1) to provide the facilities that house Core equipment and an office for the
laboratory director, (2) to maintain the equipment, (3) and to obtain new equipment to increase core capability.
Core usage is carefully monitored to ensure priority of use among Core participants as follows: NEI R01-
funded participants have first priority for use (1), followed by participants with NIH new investigator status that
are actively seeking an NEI R01 (2), then by participants that are collaborating as key personnel on an NEI

Project/Summary Abstract
Assessment of ocular structures and visual function is essential to both basic and translational research in vision
science whether in animal models or human subjects. Widely used technologies include optical coherence
tomography (OCT) for display of layered tissues in posterior and anterior segments, electroretinography (ERG,
for massed retinal signals separable into multiple identified components), slit lamp for bio-microscopy of anterior
and posterior segment, imaging of the fundus via multiple modes of visualization (color, autofluorescence, dye-
based angiography, infrared reflectance), and optokinetic nystagmus (to assess visuomotor control, visual acuity
and contrast sensitivity). In response to growing UAB vision researcher needs, the “Ocular Phenotyping Core”
was established to encompass a comprehensive suite of instrumentation and to provide the necessary support
for accurate ocular phenotyping. Specific instruments include Bioptigen 840 nm SD-OCT and Micron IV digital
fundus camera for small animals, Optomotry optokinetic nystagmus in small animals including rats, mice and
zebrafish, and Spectralis SDOCT for large animals and human donor eyes. An S10 grant awarded to Dr. Paul
Gamlin in 2020 has allowed the purchase of three new tools that will greatly enhance ocular phenotyping of both
large and small animal tissues 1) Zeiss Lumera 700 ReScan with Resight 700 operating microscope with
intraoperative optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging; 2) FLEX Module Spectralis OCT2 System for
imaging the retina and optic nerve head with structural and angiographic OCT, in animals at various body
positions; 3) Anterior Segment CASIA SS-1000 swept source OCT (Tomey Corp.) for imaging the cornea, iris,
and lens in large animals, as well as the whole eye in small animals.
This core will support 15 UAB Vision Scientists, including 13 with planned moderate to extensive all of whom are
currently NEI R01-funded. The Director and Associate Director of this proposed core have extensive publication
experience in electroretinography and OCT validation/ interpretation, respectively. New directions for the core
will include the completion of a new LED-based ERG system that will simplify this testing. Further, an
existing AOSLO system originally designed for human retinal imaging will be re-engineered in order to image
rodent and tree shrew eyes in vivo. At the same time, capabilities for fluorescence imaging and cell-targeted
photo-stimulation will be added. Additionally, Ocular Phenotyping Opportunities will be advertised to identify new
ocular mouse models through full ocular phenotyping screens of mouse models generated by non-ocular

10899525,"UAB Core Center for Vision Research – Research Programming & Computational Analysis Core
Project Summary/Abstract
The Research Programming and Computational Analysis (RPCA) Core was created in 2013 as a result of
strategic task realignment within the existing P30 Core Grant to better align services previously performed in the
Computer Core with current and emerging research needs. This re-alignment was brought about in response to
the increasing complexity of digital data, particularly laboratory-generated images in vision research, and the
need to develop custom analysis routines to process, summarize, quantify, and database those data. Custom
image analysis and processing routines in particular are an increasingly critical component of vision research,
particularly with the emergence of several new clinical and research imaging modalities such as conventional
and adaptive optics optical coherence tomography imaging and volumetric microscopy techniques. In addition,
a vast array of research data is now digital, necessitating the development of custom data management,
databasing, filtering, and quantification schemes through research programming. The second longstanding
primary function of the RPCA Core is to develop custom software interfaces for control of and data acquisition
from new and existing research equipment. Much of this equipment is developed in-house through collaborations
with the Instrumentation Core, and custom software interfaces are a mainstay of instrument development,
implementation, and data acquisition. Custom programming for data analysis and instrument interfaces is out of
the reach of most investigators due to the high cost of competent programmers and the relatively limited need
within individual projects. The goal of this core module is to offer researchers a comprehensive programming
and computational data analysis service where custom database programming, data analysis routines and
stand-alone programs can be developed for individual project needs by highly trained personnel. This realigned
Core anticipates moderate to extensive use from 12 of the 20 NEI R01-funded investigators at UAB."

The Cellular Imaging Core (CIC) plays a pivotal role in the multidisciplinary research pipeline of IDDRC 
investigators at Boston Children’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Located within the Kirby Neurobiology 
Center of Boston Children’s Hospital, this shared microscopy facility offers researchers access to high-end and 
specialized microscopy and digital imaging approaches which they can harness to understand the underlying 
mechanisms and structural changes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. The Core offers widefield, 
confocal (multiphoton, laser-scanning, spinning disk) and super-resolution (stimulated emission depletion, 
STED) microscopes for high resolution subcellular localization of proteins of interest, for tracking live cells over 
prolonged periods of time, and for monitoring populations of cells in vivo in an awake, behaving animal. These 
instruments are accompanied with access to image analysis workstations, and importantly, to an extensive 
educational program that trains researchers one-on-one on the capabilities and limitations of each instrument 
and software package used. Core staff can also collaborate closely with IDDRC researchers in core-assisted 
projects to design, optimize and implement custom designed experiments or analysis approaches. Additionally, 
the Core offers Instrumentation and Technology Courses to inform the scientific community about what is new 
for state-of-the-art microscopy, to provide interactive, hands-on workshops on image acquisition, analysis and 
processing and to address issues in robustness with these imaging methods. Through these interactions with 
researchers, the Core identifies and obtains new equipment and technology that is relevant to our researchers. 
Taken together, here the CIC proposes a comprehensive program of collaboration with IDDRC investigators

microscopy technologies that elevate and accelerate our understanding of normal and pathological neural 
development, plasticity and function."
10907604,"SUMMARY
The overall goal of the Lipid-Based Self-Assembled Materials and Characterization Core (LBSAMCC) is to
synthesize, characterize, and deliver highly novel therapeutics for ameliorating the devastating effects of nitrogen
and sulfur mustards to the eye (Project 1) and skin (Project 2). High-density lipoproteins (HDL) are small
nanoparticles that solubilize and transport cholesterol and lipids, are integral in modulating the innate immune
system, and function to enhance the integrity of epithelial barriers. The development and delivery of novel
materials that mimic these key functional features of HDLs and, importantly, enable targeting of appropriate cell
types (e.g. innate immune cells, keratocytes, and keratinocytes) in the eye and skin, highly differentiate this
platform from others to ameliorate injuries caused by mustards. The Thaxton lab pioneered the synthesis of
HDL-like synthetic biologics (HDL NPs) with an inert, solid core gold nanoparticle (AuNP) upon which the self-
assembly of lipid and protein cargos of HDLs can chemically attach. The overall size and surface chemistry can
be strictly controlled to resemble native HDLs enabling these first-generation materials to be tailorable, such that
any number of phospholipids, sterols, and/ or small molecule drugs (e.g. siRNA or microRNA) may be added.
Recent collaborations between the Thaxton and Nguyen labs further demonstrated that the AuNP of first-
generation materials can be swapped out for size-controlling organic core (oc) scaffolds, which can be used to
control biological function (e.g. cholesterol uptake and anti-inflammatory) and opens up the opportunity to load
and unload the core of these targeted materials with relevant therapies (e.g. vitamin D). Ultimately, synthetic
HDL biologics offer a tremendous opportunity for developing novel therapies against eye and/or skin injuries that
occur due to exposure to mustards. The LBSAMCC will be directly responsible for synthesizing a suite of organic
cores (Specific Aim 1) to be used as templates to produce a library of ocHDL NPs with and without small-
molecule and lipid-conjugated drugs and formulated to be topically applied to the eye and skin (Specific Aim 2).
Furthermore, the LBSAMCC will facilitate the complete physicochemical and functional screening of the ocHDL
NPs (Specific Aim 3) so that they can be confidently delivered and further developed in each of the Projects. As
such, the LBSAMCC will deliver effective ocHDL NPs to remediate chemical mustard injuries to the eye and
skin. The impact of this work is that a rigorous approach and step-wise method will produce effective topically
delivered therapies for ameliorating the devastating injuries caused to the eye and skin by nitrogen and sulfur
mustard."
10907606,"Project Summary
The Polymeric Materials Synthesis and Characterizations Core will formulate, synthesize, and characterize lead
candidates for the mitigation of mustards and provide support and chemical expertise to other cores and projects.
The Core will be co-directed by Drs. Nathan Gianneschi (Dept. of Chemistry) and Stephen Miller (Dept. of
Microbiology-Immunology). A tiered approach will be taken to select and optimize such candidates. Initially
properties that enhance the efficacy of the materials would be determined and physiochemical analysis on the
materials of interest would be probed. One such example is our ability to enrich materials for radical scavenging
at the chemical doping level. Other properties would include surface charge, porosity, binding capacity, and
solubility of materials. Depending on the material and application for the skin or eyes, the candidate material will
be formulated as a nanoparticle, or as a surface coating and the delivery could be optimized for its specific
application. That is, materials can be prepared for delivery via direct application as a liquid solution or cast into
a film or in the case of PLGA Immune Modifying Particles (PLGA-IMPs) for intravenous infusion. After initial in
vitro and in vivo studies, materials will be scaled-up for clinical trials, with many of the proposed systems already
known to be amenable to that kind of scale-up. The Polymeric Materials Synthesis and Characterizations Core
will be responsible for advancing the synthesis of materials such as polymers from small molecules, will make
chemical modifications to improve lead compounds/materials, and will synthesize components for the Lipid-
Based Self-Assembled Materials Synthesis and Characterization Core. The goals of this core are to develop
formulations and delivery platforms for lead candidates such as melanin, biodegradable polymeric PLGA IMPs
(which will be further modified by encapsulating anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10 and TGF-β) and compounds
(e.g. Vitamin D), and peptide-based delivery systems for the skin and eyes by modifying their physiochemical
properties and by characterizing materials for scale-up and clinical translation. For the Polymeric Materials
Synthesis and Characterizations Core we propose the following Aims: Aim 1: Utilizing melanin for the
remediation and adsorption of mustards; Aim 2: Protein-Like Polymers for treatment of mustard gas in the eye;
and Aim 3: Production and characterization of negatively-charged, biodegradable PLGA Immune-Modifying
Nanoparticles (PLGA-IMPs) for therapeutic treatment of chemical tissue injury."
10907610,"A key aspect of the Northwestern University CounterAct Center of EXcellence (NUCCX) is to create a
collaborative countermeasure research community. The overall goal of this core is to centralize and coordinate
all of the intellectual activities of the NUCCX with an emphasis on attracting new investigators into the field of
mustard injury. One of the ways that this goal can best be accomplished is through a comprehensive education
and training program emphasizing personal and professional development, coupled with a vigorous community
outreach effort and an unwavering commitment to recruiting women and URMs into the NUCCX community.
One of the strengths of the NUCCX is its diversified group of scientists from the departments of chemistry,
dermatology, immunology, medicine, ophthalmology, physics and astronomy, and urology. These scientists are
located within Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences.
In addition to the faculty, there will be undergraduate, graduate, medical students, residents and postdoctoral
fellows. However, such diversity also brings with it the challenge of cohesivity, which will be another mission of
this core. Through engagement with outreach initiatives, the Education and Enrichment program will also
encompass Science in Society (SIS) and community partners including Chicago Public School partners and
Boys & Girls Clubs of Chicago. Specifically, this core will: (i)l foster education and training with multidisciplinary
seminars, workshops, and networking opportunities; (ii) advance personal and professional development of
NUCCX trainees and investigators[ (iii) engage community partners through Northwestern University’s Science
in Society (SiS); (iv) promote inclusivity and diversity within the mustard injury field; and (v) conduct evaluations
of the overall program and of key aspects of the education and enrichment program, including trainee
professional development. A major initiative will be the fostering of sex and minority representation in the field of
mustard injury. An innovative aspect of the seminar series is that seminars will be recorded, and with the slides,
curated to create continuous learning as new researchers enter into the NUCCX and the field. We envision that
after a few years, an online blended course will be developed. The core will disseminate material related to the
above program on the NUCCX website and through electronic communication to the local research community.
With respect to sex and underrepresented minorities (URM), in coordination with the Skin Biology & Diseases
Resource-Based Center (SBDRC) and T-32 Training Grant program within the Department of Dermatology, the
NUCCX will align with their endeavors to attract and recruit URM and women into countermeasures research.
The NUCCX training and education program will highlight research within these communities and provide
networking opportunities for trainees. The Education and Enrichment Core will accomplish all of these tasks with
guidance from: (i) the Steering Committee; (ii) the Internal Advisory Board; and (iii) an External Advisory Board."
10907613,"SUMMARY
Sulfur mustard (SM) is a reactive bifunctional alkylating agent that reacts with a variety of small molecules and
macromolecules such as DNA. SM was used as a chemical warfare agent during World War I and many times
thereafter. SM and nitrogen mustard (NM) cause severe epithelial and deep tissue injury characterized by acute
inflammation, induration, swelling, and blistering upon contact. The influx of immune cells first by neutrophils
followed by monocytes and macrophages provide defense to the damaged epithelium; however, with time,
persistent inflammation results in an immune storm that incurs additional tissue damage resulting in a long
recovery process. Treatment of SM injuries is complicated due to the complexity of the mustard-induced injury
combined with variables of exposure concentration and time to therapy. Thus, novel therapies to prevent the
deleterious effects of SM exposure is a major unmet need. Our goal is to develop countermeasures using
topical and systemic interventions. Specifically we will focus on switching off key cellular events upstream
in the injury cascade to limit the immune storm and induction of tissue matrix factors. To achieve this
goal, we will undertake a comprehensive nanoparticle-based approach to 1) block monocytes and macrophages
from entering injured skin and 2) stabilize SM injured skin to block further release of chemo-attractants for
immune cells. We have shown that a high dose systemic administration of vitamin D3 suppresses innate immune
cell activity and ameliorates damage to the skin and circulating blood cells following SM and NM exposure.
Therefore, combinations of novel nanoparticle-based materials with vitamin D3 may yield positive treatment
results. The novel particles that we will test are (i) i.v. administration of poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) immune
modifying microparticles (PLGA-IMPs). These particles have anti-inflammatory properties because they block
monocytes and neutrophils from leaving the vessels and entering into sites of tissue injury; (ii) topical application
of synthetic, functional high-density lipoprotein nanoparticles (HDL NPs) inherently enhance re-epithelialization
following wounding and can act as anti-inflammatory agents; and (iii) topical application of a synthetic mimic of
melanin using dopamine formed into spherical polydopamine nanoparticles (PDA NPs). These particles reduce
NM-induced inflammation and edema. Our strategy is use systemic infusion of PLGA-IMP to block monocyte
and macrophages to mitigate skin and systemic manifestations from NM and SM exposure. We will use HDL
NP to target skin and immune cells NF-kB activity, and we will use PDA NPs to topically block acute inflammation.
We will also investigate the efficacy of these particles in combination with vitamin D3. Ultimately, these
investigations will yield unique treatments for SM-induced injury that will have anti-inflammatory, pro-resolving,
capacity with minimal side effects. These novel drugs also will have market sustainability factor by having multiple
indications; not only for treating SM injury, but in patients with skin burns."
10907615,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The ocular anterior surface in conjunction with the tear film provide the first line of defense against penetration
of noxious agents, which can adversely affect vision. Once this two-component system is breached, the
anterior surface is capable of mounting a vigorous response, which involves a relatively rapid re-
epithelialization along with a brisk inflammatory episode. A variant on the response of the anterior segment to
perturbation occurs to patients following exposure to the chemical warfare agent, sulfur mustard (SM). The
acute symptoms usually resolve completely without further inflammation after 2-6 weeks. However, in a subset
of patients, corneal epithelial erosions, limbal ischemia, and, occasionally, peripheral corneal thinning and
neovascularization may slowly progress. With respect to treatment modalities, either steroidal or non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs are the accepted treatment for the acute and prolonged phases. However, long-term
use of topical steroids in SM ocular injuries is not ideal. Thus, additional therapies to prevent the ocular
deterioration of SM victims is a major unmet need. We have recently demonstrated that topical application
of synthetic, functional high-density lipoprotein nanoparticles (HDL NPs) inherently enhance re-epithelialization
following corneal wounding and can act as anti-inflammatory agents following a chemical burn to the cornea.
Furthermore, HDL NPs are effective vehicles for the delivery of miRNAs to the cornea. Therefore, HDL NPs
will be complexed with miR-184, a highly angiostatic miRNA in the cornea, to treat the delayed phase of NM-
induced corneal injury. We also have evidence that Vitamin D3 (Vit D3) and poly(lactic-co-glycolicacid) immune
modifying nanoparticles (PLGA-IMPs) systemically or HDL NPs topically, administered to mice that were
exposed to topical nitrogen mustard (NM), an analogue of SM, significantly reduce pro-inflammatory and
angiogenic signaling. Collectively, these observations on HDLs, Vit D3, miR-184 and PLGA-IMPs have vast
translational potential as novel treatment modalities for SM-induced injury to the eye. To test this idea, we will
develop and assess these topical ocular therapeutics for the acute and delayed phases of NM injury to mice.
We will evaluate the efficacy and mechanisms underlying these treatments with a combination of clinical,
morphological, cell biological and immunological approaches. Additionally, we will evaluate a new class of HDL
NPs that replace the inorganic Au core with an organic, transparent lipid-conjugated core scaffold, which will
not inhibit the passage of light. We will also appraise the utility of systemic administration of Vit D3 or PLGA-
IMPs to treat the delayed phase of NM-induced ocular injury. These results will establish the most effective
topical and systemic regimens to treat the acute and delayed phases of NM injury. Finally, we will apply this
knowledge to evaluate the efficacy of our chosen treatments for SM injury in rabbit eyes using the approaches
described for NM injury. Ultimately, our studies will yield innovative treatments for SM-induced injury that will
have anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenic, pro-resolving, capabilities with minimal side effects."
10907618,"Mustard gas and mustard-related compounds are alkylating agents that cause severe epithelial and deep tissue
injury characterized by acute inflammation, induration, edema, and blistering upon contact. The underlying
mechanism of tissue damage following exposure to nitrogen mustard (NM) and sulfur mustard (SM) is complex.
After the initial direct injury to the skin there is an influx of immune cells that provide a defense to a breached
epithelium but can produce unfavorable inflammation culminating in an immune storm that sets off a cascade of
tissue injury. Historic use of SM demonstrates that the consequences extend beyond surfaces of the skin. Our
group has shown by suppressing activated macrophages systemically with high dose vitamin D can ameliorate
both local skin and deeper tissue injury. Given that the totality of injury from mustard exposure is attributable to
the toxic agent and the activities of the immune system, it may be naive to consider that a single countermeasure
can adequately and comprehensively mitigate the effects of mustard. We will leverage our experience with NM
and SM, and access to banked tissue from in vivo NM exposure in humans and SM in large animals, to serve as a
foundation to unravel the signals in the skin compartment vs. the immune compartment. Mustard exposed skin
explants will be immunophenotyped and the harvested culture supernatants will be used to stimulate activation of
naïve peripheral blood immune cells. Our human Mustard Skin Explant and Supernatant (MuSES) experimental
setup approximates features of human skin in vivo, exposed to SM and will enable studies that delineate
inflammatory factor production by the skin and immune compartments. Inflammation profiles from MuSES will be
validated using tissue from our in vivo human clinical trials in patients undergoing field treatment for precancerous
skin treatments. Given the remarkable resemblance of the skin phenotype reaction, we can gather information
from in vivo human exposure models to test our two countermeasures . Clinical outcomes coupled with novel
signature molecular targets will facilitate proof-of-concept (POC) clinical trials in 5-FU patients (delayed start to
years 3-5). Our countermeasure strategies are to block the activation of skin infiltrating immune cells with vitamin
D3 or block their entry into the skin with PLGA-immune modifying microparticles. This combined approach is aimed
at limiting the surge of cytokines and inhibiting downstream tissue matrix factors released in the skin. The goals
of this project are to better understand reactions of the skin and immune system using a combination of human
tissue and trials to develop medical countermeasures."

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the US and worldwide, largely because most
patients have advanced, incurable disease at the time of diagnosis. However, lung cancer
screening (LCS) with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) has the potential to revolutionize
lung cancer outcomes through early detection. As LCS is disseminated into real-world settings
and populations, a key outstanding question is whether the benefits/harms ratio found in clinical
trials will apply to an older and sicker population. The basic conundrum facing LCS candidates is
that the single risk factor most strongly linked to lung cancer -- smoking history -- is also strongly
linked to morbidity and death from non-lung cancer causes (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease emphysema), which limit life expectancy and increase risk of complications from
diagnostic or therapeutic procedures. The overarching goal of our proposed study is to precisely
characterize this vulnerable subpopulation with high comorbidity burden, quantifying for them the
benefits and harms of LCS to enable more informed decision-making by patients contemplating
LCS. Our study will help close this knowledge gap by leveraging real-world data to more fully
characterize this subpopulation of “marginal” LCS candidates, reducing the uncertainty currently
facing patients and providers. More specifically, we propose to leverage electronic health records
and claims data for patients ages 55-80 (n~34,039) undergoing annual screening with LDCT in
geographically diverse real-world settings from 2016-2022. We will then use these observational
data with validated models in the Cancer Intervention Simulation Network to simulate LCS
outcomes in the real-world US population. By generating previously unavailable real-world data
for use in validated simulation models, this proposal responds directly to calls to improve patient-
centered decision-making in LCS candidates for whom the net benefits of screening are currently
highly uncertain."

10906028,"Project Summary/Abstract
The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in over 26 million infections and overwhelmed healthcare systems
throughout the U.S. The novel nature of COVID-19 has generated unprecedented diagnostic and therapeutic
dilemmas. One area of emerging concern is the collateral impact of the pandemic on increased antibiotic
prescribing and an associated acceleration of bacterial resistance. For instance, early reports indicate that a
high percentage of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 receive antibiotics despite few having confirmed
bacterial co-infections. In addition to the public health implications, overuse of antibiotics is also a threat to
patient safety due to the risk of serious adverse drug events and Clostridioides difficile colitis. In January 2021,
the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America issued a white paper outlining research priorities related to
COVID-19 that highlighted an urgent need to “identify the impact of changes in health care utilization and
delivery on antibiotic prescribing” and “develop and implement optimal Antimicrobial Stewardship Program
(ASP) strategies to improve antimicrobial use and patient outcomes while adapting to changing healthcare
delivery during COVID-19”. This project is specifically designed to address this call to action as we aim to
comprehensively characterize the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on antibiotic prescribing and bacterial
resistance trends in acute care hospitals and identify strategies that effectively promote resilient antibiotic
stewardship. The assembled team is uniquely qualified to conduct this project given our expertise in evaluating
antibiotic prescribing patterns, access to data from ~350 U.S. hospitals and extensive experience using
systems engineering methods to analyze stewardship interventions. For the quantitative analyses, we will first
characterize overall and condition specific antibiotic prescribing trends before and after COVID-19 using an
interrupted time series analysis. Next, we will identify patient and hospital level factors that increased the risk of
non-indicated antibiotic prescribing during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the goal of identifying potential
intervention targets. Finally, we will complete a systems engineering guided qualitative analysis, focused on
hospitals that least and most effectively mitigated the impact of COVID-19 on antibiotic prescribing, to identify
systems-level contextual factors and strategies. These results will be used in a multidisciplinary co-design
process to develop an antibiotic stewardship implementation toolkit that enhances resiliency during operational
upheaval and is transferable between organizations. Given the dynamic nature of the pandemic (e.g. variant
strains), it is imperative to classify the previous, ongoing and future adverse impacts on antibiotic prescribing to
guide development of tailored stewardship strategies for widespread dissemination. This work represents a
vital contribution to AHRQ’s ongoing efforts to combat both COVID-19 and the longstanding pandemic of
antimicrobial-resistant infections."
10890687,"This FastTrack Phase 1/2 application aims to create a new IND-ready CAR-T platform for the
treatment of HIV, developed in the laboratory and tested in non-human primates. Molecular
engineering techniques have been applied to create chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) expressed
in T cells to target HIV-infected cells. CD4-based CARs are designed to achieve immune
eradication of HIV1 infections through recognizing gp120 envelope protein on infected cells.
However, prior clinical trials did not meet with success, which we propose to address with the plan
of this research. One of the features predicted to affect efficiency of CD4 CAR is T cell exhaustion,
characterized by high PD1 expression of HIV-specific CD8 and CD4 T cells. Our laboratory
recently defined transcription factor YY1 to be master regulator of T cell exhaustion, mediating
upregulation of checkpoint receptors (CR) and downregulation of Type I cytokines with
accompanying cytotoxic failure. We confirmed that YY1 is increased in parallel with PD1 in CD4
T cells in chronic HIV infection. Knockdown of YY1 restored cytokine IL2 production in preclinical
testing and reduced CR expression, including exhaustion marker PD1, where blocked PD1 and
restored IL2 correlated with recovered T cell cytotoxic potency. Another drawback of prior CD4-
based CAR-T is that CD8 T cells expressing the CD4 CAR receptor are now readily infected and
eliminated by HIV that could also have hampered success of prior human trials. Lastly, prior tests
involved 1st generation (gen) CARs of limited signaling potential that are now improved with
addition of costimulation that may be yet further improved. Our overall goal is to create a more
effective CAR-T for the control of HIV. Our Aims for this proposal include (1) creating anti-HIV
CAR-T cells that will resist T cell exhaustion with incorporation of YY1 shRNA for sustained anti-
HIV potency. Further, we will (2) render the CD4 CAR-T infection-proof with RNAi intervention to
block infection and virus replication in the CAR-T. Finally, we will (3) conduct a complementary
effort to generate new 3rd gen 3-signal CD4 CARs (CAR3) that incorporate additional
costimulatory molecules to improve potency and reactivation potential. Building on our
considerable preliminary work, we will quickly finish the Phase 1 component to complete
molecular engineering efforts in months 1-6, moving directly to Phase 2 in vitro and then non-
human primate testing. This plan is a collaboration between IT Bio, LLC (Boston) and the lab of
Dr Steven Braun (Tulane). The Tulane National Primate Research Center (TNPRC) will conduct
the NHP experiments under the direction of IT Bio, LLC through a fee-for-service contract. With
these three efforts – suppressing T cell exhaustion, rendering CAR-T infection-proof and
increasing T cell potency and reactivation potential – we hope to obtain a novel, IND-ready cellular
therapeutic agent that will provide a sustained control of HIV to parallel recent successes in CAR-
T treatment of B cell cancers."
10913342,"Background: Seventeen Veterans die by suicide on a daily basis, and Veterans often seek care in Emergency
Departments (EDs) prior to a suicide attempt. Lethal means safety (LMS) interventions, which aim to reduce
access to common methods of suicide such as firearms or toxic medications, are considered important
components of suicide prevention programs and are recommended for Veterans with elevated suicide risk.
Significance/Impact: The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) considers suicide prevention a clinical and
research priority. In 2019, VHA began screening all Veterans seeking ED care for elevated suicide risk. The
VA’s National Strategy for Preventing Veteran Suicide highlights “efforts to reduce access to lethal means of
suicide among Veterans with identified suicide risk.” However, no LMS intervention has been developed to
accompany this initiative and prior LMS interventions have not been developed for US Veterans or VHA
settings. The proposed work will address this critical gap in VHA suicide prevention efforts by developing and
testing a Veteran-centered, ED-based LMS intervention for multiple methods of suicide.
Innovation: Several evidence gaps must be addressed in developing such an intervention. No prior LMS
intervention has been shown to be efficacious in promoting medication and firearm safety, and prior
interventions have not accounted for the various, person-specific mechanisms by which individuals change
behaviors. The proposed intervention will incorporate multiple evidence-informed elements specifically chosen
to target different but complimentary behavioral mechanisms highlighted within the Health Belief Model (e.g.,
self-efficacy) as critical to behavior change. Elements include those that equip staff with evidence-based
communication strategies, and provide Veterans with practical, patient-centered support to facilitate LMS
behaviors. To ensure that this intervention meets the needs of at-risk ED patients and is sustainable long-term
if shown to be efficacious, we will engage Veteran and clinical stakeholders to develop the intervention.
Engaging stakeholders in intervention development, an emerging VHA priority, is critical for ensuring feasibility,
acceptability, and credibility. As one Veteran remarked during a focus group, “I appreciate you all askin’ us
what we’re thinkin’, rather than just sayin’, ya know, here’s what it is and here’s what it’s gonna be.”
Specific Aims and Methodology:
Aim 1: Identify contextual factors that may inform development of the intervention. I will conduct semi-
structured qualitative interviews with up to 30 at-risk Veterans who recently received VHA ED care to identify
intrapersonal, interpersonal, and institutional factors that should be considered during intervention refinement
and adaptation in Aim 2.
Aim 2: Leverage the expertise of a diverse sample of stakeholders to refine intervention elements, adapt them
for use among Veterans and within VHA EDs, and develop a final intervention protocol and related materials.
Building on prior studies and knowledge gained from Aim 1, I will employ a stakeholder-engaged process to
refine, adapt, and finalize the LMS intervention protocol and materials. I will use two evidence-based methods
to engage stakeholders and build consensus (Nominal Group Technique, online modified-Delphi process).
Aim 3: Pilot the ED-based LMS intervention among 40 Veterans to assess feasibility and acceptability. I will
assess feasibility of recruitment, staff fidelity to the intervention, and Veteran engagement, including after ED
discharge, and acceptability of the intervention among participants, intervention staff, and ED staff.
Next Steps/Implementation: Results from this pilot study will support an IIR application to test the efficacy of
this intervention in promoting LMS behaviors among at-risk Veterans. If found to be efficacious, consistent with
VHA’s public health approach to suicide prevention and my long-term career goals, my future work will aim to
adapt and disseminate the intervention across various VHA (e.g., primary care) and community settings."

Our proposed NCBIB resource, ReproNim: A Center for Reproducible Neuroimaging Computation, seeks
to continue to drive a shift in the way neuroimaging research is performed and reported. In the first award
period, we have successfully created a substantial set of tools, developed best practices and trained a cadre of
users that improves the baseline reproducibility of many studies. But there is more to do. Through the
continued development and implementation of technology that supports more efficiency and effectiveness for
more users, we extend our comprehensive set of data management, analysis and utilization frameworks in
support of both basic research and clinical activities. Our overarching goal is to improve the reproducibility
of neuroimaging science and extend the value of our national investment in neuroimaging research, while
making the process easier and more efficient for investigators. Reproducibility is critical because the
current literature is fraught with published results that are due to mistakes (occasionally misconduct); or turn
out to be false positives (contributed to by the lack of statistical power). More importantly, given the current
publication system, it is exceedingly difficult to discern between false positive and true positive finding as data
is hard to aggregate, and exact methods are hard to replicate.
In this Administration Core, we seek to continue to seamlessly and efficiently administer the overall
operations of the Center. To accomplish this, we will: 1) Provide overall management of the day-to-day
operations of the Center; 2) Provide continuous self-monitoring and external verification of our progress and
direction; and 3) Promote our technological developments with a voice that is heard within the national and
international neuroimaging, neuroinformatics and reproducibility research communities. We will work in
partnership with the other TR&D projects and the Collaborative and Service Project users and the Training and
Dissemination Core to foster knowledge of and use of the reproducible framework in the neuroimaging
research community."
10914880,"Summary/Abstract
Tremendous progress on cancer has been made at the molecular level over the past decade, largely due to
the broad application of high throughput, large-scale bulk whole genome, exome and RNA sequencing. In
particular, the discovery of numerous medium to high-penetrance drivers, characterization of pathogenic
germline variants, and the revelation of many-to-many relationships of genes and pathways, have brought a
fuller view of the combinatorial complexity of cancer. Indeed, newer technologies, like single-cell and spatial
genomics methods, are now augmenting bulk sequence data to power deeper studies of cancer dynamics,
such as heterogeneity, evolution, and interaction with the microenvironment. The current view is that such
advanced data, augmented by improved bioinformatics analysis tools and larger, well-curated cohorts will
enable medicine to push beyond statistical descriptions toward a genuine deterministic understanding of
cancer. Toward this goal, our proposal seeks to extend and apply established bioinformatics systems to
integrate the above technologies and leverage our broad range of capabilities and to support the NCI Genomic
Characterization Network (NCI-GCN) and Center for Cancer Genomics (CCG) via three specific aims: (1)
annotating and interpreting coding and non-coding somatic and germline alterations, (2) characterizing tumor
cell populations, evolution, and the tumor microenvironment, and (3) unlocking biological and clinical insights at
both the individual and cross-cancer (Pan-Cancer) levels to discern basic themes across the major human
cancers. Our approach involves fluencies in four areas of core competence outlined in the program RFA: DNA
mutations, long-read sequence analysis, scRNA-Seq analysis, and spatial genomics data analysis (with
connection to digital imaging analysis)."
10922682,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
We propose herein a methodology to identify synthetic peptide-based binders to non-canonical structural
motifs in RNA. Reagents that selectively target these biologically important motifs would be transformative
theranostic tools for study and modulation of RNA-governed biology. The long-term goal of our research
program is to develop sequence and context-selective reagents for targeting of any such non-canonical
structural motif in lncRNAs. The objective of this application is to synthesize a small library of peptide-derived
reagents and quantitatively rank their competence in non-canonical hybridization to defined RNA structures,
using novel and robust functional screening methods in vitro and in cell culture. In contrast to the striking
progress of synthetic biology at the coding interface, non-canonical targeting remains in development. We
hypothesize that progress in this area is limited in a number of ways: 1) a prior focus on targeting Watson-Crick
(WC) paired bases rather than non-canonical pairs; 2) an over-emphasis on intercalation-driven binding; 3)
lack of exploration of secondary structure in RNA targeting reagents; 4) lack of a unified functional assay to
rigorously evaluate binding. We further hypothesize that synthetic binding solutions exist for every
non-canonical motif; if these solutions could be found, then non-canonical hybridization could be programmed
in the same way that duplex hybridization is programmed. Such an advance would enable precise interrogation
of nucleic acid biology with novel chemical tools. The rigor of the prior research lies in the known efficiency of
synthetic bases in targeting select non-canonical pairs, as well as preliminary data demonstrating tunable and
expansive binding selectivity via backbone and base modification. We will test our central hypothesis and
accomplish the overall objective of this application via the following three specific aims: 1) Synthesis and
evaluation of bPNAs targeting non-canonical sites via base-triple formation; 2) Enzymatic and functional
assays for bPNA-RNA targeting efficacy; 3) In vitro and intracellular bPNA targeting and selectivity for
structural motifs in native RNAs."
10689748,"Background. In the United States, two women die every day from pregnancy-related complications. Non-
Hispanic Black women die at 3 to 4 times the rate of non-Hispanic White women, and women living in rural
areas and women with low income are also at increased risk. For every pregnancy-related death, about 100
more women nearly die due to severe maternal morbidity (SMM), or complications from pregnancy and/or
delivery that result in significant lasting health consequences. Research suggests that >60% of these deaths
and SMM events are preventable, and that improving women’s health before pregnancy (e.g., managing
chronic medical and mental health conditions) may be one key to prevention. Little is known about women
Veterans’ pre-pregnancy health risks and maternal outcomes. Preliminary data from pilot work suggest that the
rate of pregnancy-associated deaths among Veterans using VA maternity care benefits is nearly double the
national rate. Because women Veterans have a high prevalence of chronic medical and mental health
conditions, and given that half (48%) of women Veterans age 18-45 identify as non-White and 25% live in rural
areas, it is critical to examine the role of these pre-pregnancy health risks in adverse maternal outcomes and to
explore how patterns of comorbid health risk factors vary among women from vulnerable subgroups.
Significance / Impact. The proposed research will fill major gaps in the literature about the etiology of
maternal mortality and SMM both within and outside of VA, and directly aligns with VHA and HSR&D priorities
around women’s health and health equity. Innovation. This study is the first to examine the impact of pre-
pregnancy health risks on maternal outcomes among a national cohort of women Veterans and the first to
examine whether social characteristics modify associations between pre-pregnancy health and maternal
outcomes. Specific Aims. Aim 1 is a quantitative study to classify women Veterans according to co-occurring
pre-pregnancy health risks, describe associations between risk profile groups and adverse maternal outcomes,
and identify how these associations vary across population subgroups. Aim 2 is a qualitative study to examine
women Veterans’ pre-pregnancy healthcare needs, experiences, and preferences. Aim 3 involves intervention
development, refinement, and pilot testing with the input of key VA clinical and operational informants and
women Veterans. Methodology. Aim 1 will use latent class analysis and multiple regression to examine a
national cohort of over 30,000 pregnancies to women Veterans in FY2010-2019. Aim 2 will recruit and
interview ~30 women Veterans about their experiences and needs related to pre-pregnancy health and health
care in VA. Aim 3 will recruit ~6 VA clinical and operational informants and ~3 women Veterans for a VA
stakeholder advisory panel, 5-10 women Veterans and their providers to provide feedback on intervention
components, and 10-15 women Veterans and providers to pilot test the intervention components.
Implementation / Next Steps. Findings will be presented to local and national operations partners and will
directly inform follow-up research to test one or more of a set of patient-centered pre-pregnancy health
intervention strategies in multiple VA primary care sites. Candidate. Dr. Deirdre Quinn is a postdoctoral
research fellow in women’s health at the VA Center for Health Equity Research and Promotion. The purpose of
this CDA-2 is to facilitate Dr. Quinn’s successful transition to an independent VA health services investigator
focused on achieving quality and equity in women Veterans’ reproductive health. The objective of this CDA-2
research is to examine how links between women Veterans’ pre-pregnancy health risks (e.g., chronic
conditions), social characteristics (e.g., race/ethnicity, rurality), healthcare experiences, and maternal
outcomes can inform opportunities to improve women Veterans’ healthcare. This objective will be achieved
through expert mentorship and in-depth training in: (1) advanced quantitative research; (2) qualitative research;
(3) designing and testing intervention strategies to improve women’s health; and (4) professional leadership."
10911995,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Significant data implicate a role for autoantibodies to citrullinated proteins in RA pathogenesis, and
autoantibodies to the citrullinating enzyme peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) are also found in a subset of
patients with the most severe joint disease. Citrullination is the calcium-dependent conversion of peptidyl-
arginine to citrulline by the PAD enzymes, but the mechanisms that initiate immune responses to citrullination-
associated autoantigens are poorly understood. While different several mechanisms have been proposed, our
published and preliminary data implicate cytotoxic lymphocyte-mediated killing of neutrophils in the generation
of citrullinated autoantigens and immunogenic PAD4 in a subset of patients with RA. A pathogenic role for
cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in this process is strongly supported by our preliminary work on patients with T
cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia (T-LGLL), a rare form of leukemia in which 20-30% of patients develop
RA (T-LGLL/RA). This disease is characterized by clonal expansion of CD8+ T cells, neutropenia and somatic
activating mutations in STAT3. Interestingly, we have found striking autoimmune and genetic similarities between
T-LGLL/RA and the anti-PAD4 antibody positive subgroup of RA, suggesting a common pathogenic origin for
the development of arthritis in these two diseases. Importantly, these findings make T-LGLL/RA a powerful yet
simplified human model driven by pathogenic CTLs, in which to study novel pathogenic mechanisms in RA. In
this project, we will use unique cohorts of patients with RA and T-LGLL/RA, as well as innovative and state of
the art technologies, to examine the novel hypothesis that killing of neutrophils by pathogenic CTLs is a central
mechanism promoting the lack of tolerance to autoantigens in a unique serologically distinct RA subset. To
address this hypothesis we will define: 1) common pathogenic mechanisms linked to autoreactive CTL expansion
and serological profiles indicative of CTL-driven disease in RA and T-LGLL/RA; 2) how the cytotoxic lymphocyte
granule pathway shapes the repertoire of autoantigens presented from dying neutrophils to autoreactive CD4+
T cells by antigen presenting cells; and 3) the clonality, specificity and effector functions of autoreactive CD8+ T
cells in RA and T-LGLL/RA. Our long-term goal is to apply this knowledge to define precise mechanism-guided
preventive and therapeutic interventions in RA."

10932123,"CANCER RESEARCH EDUCATION PROGRAM: SUMMARY
Effectively addressing cancer health disparities requires a comprehensive, multidisciplinary diverse workforce to
address multi-level and complex health inequities, which are evident in the continuing disproportionate cancer
incidence and mortality rates of underrepresented minorities. To fully understand and address the most critical
factors effecting cancer health disparities, it is necessary to continuously enhance the design, approach,
implementation, dissemination, and practice of cancer health disparities research. Likewise, it is fundamental to
establish a sustainable infrastructure that will facilitate the didactic training and inclusion of more
underrepresented minority (URM) investigators and students in cancer health disparities research. Virginia State
University (VSU) and Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) Massey Cancer Center (MCC) have established
a collaborative Cancer Research Education Program (VSU-MCC CREP) to maximize existing institutional
resources and to build an infrastructure that will increase the capacity of faculty and students to pursue and
facilitate cancer health disparities research and enhance VSU’s ability to lead in education, community
engagement, and research in cancer health disparities in Virginia.
The overall goal of the VSU-MCC CREP partnership is to pilot test cancer health disparities training and
education programs and to use the preliminary data to not only advocate for the institutionalization of these
programs but also to inform the development of a pipeline for VSU URM faculty to successfully compete for NIH
funding (K awards, R01s). The long-term goal is to develop a sustainable education and training program that
will improve the impact and scope of research discoveries and translation by increasing the number of
underrepresented minority investigators and students who can significantly inform, influence, and conduct cancer
health disparities research. Our approach is threefold: 1) develop the research capacity and capital of developing
faculty at VSU to conduct cancer disparities research; 2) increase the number of diverse students at both
institutions interested in cancer health disparities research and participating in cancer research education
experiences; and 3) increase the number of investigators at both institutions conducting cancer research.
The SUCCEED CREP will provide a set of unique and sustainable training experiences aimed at increasing the
capacity of a local historically black college to take the lead in education, community engagement, and research
in cancer-related health disparities. The organizing theme of the educational and training experiences for faculty
and students is to build the knowledge, skills, partnerships, and capacity for multidisciplinary approaches to
identify and reduce local cancer-related health disparities and their determinants."
10912661,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The prognosis for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC) patients is dismal. This is likely due to the
presence of a uniquely suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) that is dominant in most PDAC. Our data
suggest immune priming by conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) may be a necessary barrier to overcome to
generate lasting immunity in PDAC patients. cDCs are central for generating tumor antigen–specific T cell
responses. Our new data show that cDCs are severely dysfunctional in patients with PDAC. This dysfunction is
driven by two mechanisms: 1) We recently reported that PDAC patients have impaired cDC development in
their bone marrow, and this leads to functional depletion of circulation pre-DCs, and poor response to
checkpoint inhibitors. 2) We recently showed that even when cDC development is not fully impaired, cDC1s
are physically/biochemically excluded from the PDAC TME. These mechanisms to the loss of stereotactic body
radiation therapy (SBRT)-induced priming of tumor antigen-specific T cell responses and ultimately failed
tumor control in animal models. We overcame both of these dysfunctional barriers by targeting cDC1s using a
combination of systemic treatment with FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (FLT3L) and CD40 agonists. Our pre-
clinical data are exceptionally strong and have placed us in a unique position to translate these findings into
PDAC patients. Our central hypothesis is that targeting cDC can unlock responsiveness to RT by
generating lasting anti-tumor immunity. We will expand test this hypothesis in three specific aims.
Aim 1. Determine the safety and efficacy of the combination of CDX-301 plus CDX-1140 and SBRT in
locally advanced PDAC patients
Aim 2. Determine the mechanisms by which FLT3L plus a CD40 agonist induce anti-tumor immunity.
Aim 3. Determine if FLT3L plus CD40 agonists improves responsiveness to checkpoint
immunotherapy.
Impact. PDAC patient responses to conventional radiation therapy have been disappointing. Our data strongly
support the use of FLT3L and CD40 agonist to enhance patient responsiveness to RT and generate long-term
anti-tumor immunity. Our team is well-positioned to test our central hypothesis directly in clinical and
experimental studies."
10914120,"Project Summary
Satellite cells are required for the growth and regeneration of skeletal muscle. Molecular genetic analyses,
engraftment assays, and single-cell analyses have suggested that satellite cells are a heterogenous population
that potentially exhibit very distinct properties. Understanding satellite cell heterogeneity and identifying the
long-term self-renewing stem cell within the satellite cell compartment remains one of the most important
unresolved issues in muscle biology, and with the advent of technologies that facilitate single-cell analyses, is
currently attracting much interest. In preliminary experiments, we have used gene expression analysis to
define a gene signature for a subpopulation of satellite cells we term satellite stem cells. This gene signature
was then used to identify a novel cluster that contains this subpopulation using single-cell RNA-seq analysis.
Transplantation of satellite stem cells after isolation, using cell surface markers that we defined, indicate that
satellite stem cells exhibit markedly superior engraftment properties. Therefore, we hypothesize that satellite
stem cells represent the bona fide long-term self-renewing muscle stem cell. Here we propose to molecularly
characterize this important subpopulation and establish its hierarchal relationship with the larger population of
satellite cells and their progenitors. In Aim 1, we propose to characterize the function and potential of satellite
stem cells using lineage tracing and following transplantation of prospectively isolated satellite stem cells. We
will examine the expression of genes specifically expressed in satellite stem cells during asymmetric cell
divisions and lineage progression on cultured myofibers. These experiments will provide important new
information concerning the activity, potential, and function of satellite stem cells. In Aim 2, we will define the
cellular and molecular composition of satellite stem cell lineage hierarchy at the resolution of single cells. We
will use single-cell transcriptomics (RNA-seq) to delineate the differentiation trajectory of satellite stem cells
and their derivatives that arise during growth and regeneration using mice containing lineage tracing alleles,
and mice lacking genes that perturb regeneration. We will analyze the function of differentially expressed
regulatory genes using a novel high-content analysis platform. This data will allow reconstruction of the cellular
differentiation trajectories and provide important new information into the molecular regulation of self-renewal
and lineage progression. In Aim 3, we will identify and characterize human satellite stem cells by conducting
analysis of satellite cells isolated from human muscle biopsies. The notion that satellite cells are heterogenous
with a subset representing a long-term self-renewing stem cell remains controversial. Our discovery of a gene-
signature specific to satellite stem cells is therefore innovative and paradigm shifting. In particular, the
identification of cell surface markers specific to satellite stem cells will without question, facilitate rapid
advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate satellite stem cell homeostasis in
human muscle wasting diseases and in aging."

Liver regeneration is a program with a broad range of applications that is designed to maintain a healthy state of
the tissue. When the liver gets exposed to severe damage, there is an active repair response that can use the
functional cells and help them expand to the optimal size for that tissue. Many toxins and related treatments are
capable of damaging the liver tissue to the point where only a modest quantity of liver function remains. However,
under these conditions the liver is uniquely positioned to repair its structure and recover the original tissue mass
and it is these processes that help maintain liver function, referred to as Liver Regeneration. The repair process
has multiple productive applications. However, it may be derailed by processes such as the heavy consumption
of alcoholic beverages and as a result, it is subject to monitoring that may derail its usefulness. Unusually, we
recently discovered that exposure of our rats to ethanol in their food will chronically lead to a health crisis upon
liver injury only in male rats, whereas female rats did not suffer from this affliction. This finding matched our prior
studies that had demonstrated that females are more resistant to some types of alcohol-related injury. Moreover,
we have developed a research program in which males are subject to a variety of alcohol-related injuries that
females are protected from. These findings are correlated with the individual tests for sensitivity of the liver
regeneration process resolved in specific interactions. The Specific Aims are summarized here to enable the
recovery of the critical points to identify where the problems are located. These aims include (a) studies to test
the hypothesis that ethanol affects the tissue state balance of metabolic compensatory adjustments and
proliferation to disrupt the integrate response to PHx, (b) studies to test the hypothesis that interlinked cell state
transitions across multiple cell types govern the integrative response to ethanol-mediated disruption in a sex-
dependent manner; and (c) studies to identify the renormalization of the ethanol-blocked deficiencies in
hepatocyte proliferation by normalizing early phase transcriptional regulatory events; We will bridge between
animal models and human ALD in these Aims by evaluating the animal study results across a spectrum of human
ALD conditions to identify commonalities and translatable mechanisms of ethanol action and putative targets for
intervention."
10900784,"7. Project Summary
Multiple early feasibility trials in humans have demonstrated that implantable Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) can enable
people with severe paralysis to use neural signals to control remote and digital communication technologies, including
messaging and email. Such studies have demonstrated clearly that BCIs have the potential to improve the quality of life of
patients who have physical disability due to paralysis of speech and upper limbs. However, until these technologies are
commercialized, access to BCIs will remain limited to people involved in research studies, and only for the duration of their
enrolment in the study. To address this unmet need, Synchron, Inc. has developed the StentrodeTM system, a fully
implantable BCI that communicates wirelessly to an external interface on a mobile computing platform. The StentrodeTM
BCI is a 16-channel array of sensors integrated into a self-expanding, stent-like substrate. The StentrodeTM is delivered
endovascularly via a catheter to the Superior Sagittal Sinus, where it measures volitionally-modulated neural signals from
the leg area of motor cortex in both hemispheres. A fully implantable, wireless telemetry unit digitizes and transmits the
neural signals from the StentrodeTM to an external mobile processor that converts the neural signals into commands for
operating a computer or other assistive device, such as a speller for communication. The Synchron team has already initiated
a first-in-human trial of the StentrodeTM BCI system in Melbourne, Australia, under approvals granted by the Therapeutic
Goods Administration (TGA) of Australia and the IRB of the Royal Melbourne Hospital. The first human implant was
performed in a person with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in August, 2019. The participant has experienced no adverse
events and is using the system to operate a computer and type messages to friends, family, and caregivers.
The objective of the proposed research is to demonstrate in an Early Feasibility Study (EFS) that the StentrodeTM BCI
communication system is safe and effective in providing a quantifiable improvement in independence and quality of life in
n=6 people with severe paralysis due to ALS. Two Specific Aims are proposed: 1) Preclinical assessment of the StentrodeTM
for safety and functionality to complete an FDA submission, and 2) Testing of StentrodeTM’s safety and efficacy in an EFS
clinical trial in two centers of excellence in the USA. Under Aim 1 (UG3 phase), preclinical safety studies and software
validation in large animal studies will be completed to test robustness of StentrodeTM, compliance to safety standards for
Class III electromechanical implants, safety and baseline functionality in a large animal model, efficacy of custom-built
software, and a functional neuroimaging study to support presurgical planning. Under Aim 2 (UH3 phase), an EFS study
will test safety of StentrodeTM placement, monitoring adverse events, target patency, and device migration. When combined
with eye-tracking technology, users will be trained to perform computer-based tasks using eye-gaze to control cursor
position and BCI outputs to control discrete actions, such as letter or menu-item selection and zoom. Clinical efficacy
outcomes will assess the restoration of independent function by use of personal devices, including technical capability (click
and typing speed and accuracy, smart home, IoT, haptic feedback), independent domestic functionality (I-ADLs) and QOL
and mental wellbeing (WHOQOL, MacGill QOL, HADS)."
10865056,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This T32 competitive renewal application from the Yale Department of Dermatology proposes to continue its
strong track record of training future leaders in academic dermatology. Of the 32 trainees who were
supported by this T32 program during the past 15 years of funding and who have completed their
subspecialty and/or research training, 22 (>60%) are currently in full-time academic positions, and 13 are
actively engaged in substantive basic and/or clinical investigation, while 9 others are full-time clinician-
educators at Yale, Harvard, Stanford, Northwestern, and OSHU. Emphasis will be maintained on this program
developing the research and critical thinking skills of MD and MD/PhD dermatologists, although PhD
candidates with significant potential to make substantive contributions to translational and molecular
cutaneous biology will also be sought out for consideration. We also propose in the next period to capitalize
upon the experience of our faculty in training talented MD/PhD and PhD pre-doctoral students who now
populate T32 training programs across the country, including our own. The currently identified training faculty
for this renewal consists of thirty-two individuals with broad-ranging expertise in cutaneous biology and
substantive previous mentoring experience. 27 are R01-funded “Primary Mentors/Preceptors” (8 with faculty
appointments in Dermatology and 19 with appointments in nine other departments). All are established
mentors and conducting cutting-edge research collectively encompassing a substantial portion of cellular and
molecular biology. However, trainees are not restricted to these currently identified mentors as research
project preceptors; they are strongly encouraged to look broadly throughout the university for mentors whose
laboratories would provide them with the best opportunities to further develop and refine their research and
critical thinking skills. Qualifications for being a primary mentor include current R01 level sfunding, a
documented previous track record as a successful mentor, and approval by this program's Executive
Committee. Because we consider it most conducive to the trainees' development of intellectual independence
and to the introduction of new scientific skills into dermatology, substantial exposure to outstanding
investigators outside our own department will continue to be emphasized. As in past funding periods, each
trainee will have two mentors, one inside and one outside of Dermatology. Typically, the Primary Mentor/PI is
based is outside the department, and the Dermatology faculty secondary advisor serves as an additional
monitor of the trainee's progress to help ensure that her/his career trajectory stays on course. 17 Dermatology
faculty members have been designated as potenital “Secondary Mentors/Advisors” including physician-
scientists as well as those that are principally clinically oriented or have yet to fully establish their indendent
research programs. 4 individuals have been identified as junior faculty with demonstrated abilities to obtain
peer-reviewed funding and outstanding potential to become primary mentors within the next funding cycle."
10911105,"Abstract
The development of a neuroprotective therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD) would be a major therapeutic
advance, particularly for our veterans. Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) has been shown to be
the most potent protective trophic molecule to dopamine (DA) neurons affected in PD. GDNF requires CNS
delivery as it does not cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Unfortunately, clinical trials of GDNF therapy in PD
patients have given mixed results. It is challenging to deliver therapeutic levels of GDNF to all degenerating
nigrostriatal neurons using traditional surgical approaches due to the large target area in the human brain and
the poor brain tissue penetration of this molecule. We have developed a novel approach capable of resolving
these problems: hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation (HSCT)-based macrophage-mediated GDNF
delivery. This unique approach takes advantage of macrophages’ natural property of homing to sites of
neuronal degeneration, capitalizes on our powerful macrophage-specific synthetic promoter (MSP), and
implements recent advances in HSC gene therapy. Our previous work using conventional HSCT reproducibly
demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach in various (acute and chronic, and neurotoxin induced and
genetic) mouse models of PD. However, conventional HSCT requires toxic preconditioning such as irradiation
and thus may not be suitable for our veterans with PD. In the last funding cycle, we introduced our newly
developed novel non-cytotoxic HSCT method. Using this novel system, we again demonstrated that genetically
engineered HSC-derived macrophages infiltrate the brain parenchyma and accumulate at diseased sites to
provide sustained focal GDNF delivery that leads to dramatically reduced degeneration of DA neurons in the
substantia nigra of PD mice. Critically, this protection ultimately results in amelioration of motor and non-motor
dysfunction and is achievable with little apparent adverse effects. In this grant application, we propose to study
the dose-effect relationship of this novel HSCT-based approach to identify key correlates of protection and the
optimum therapeutic dose. The efficacy of this novel intervention will be validated in an additional model of PD.
Finally, single-cell RNAseq sequencing will be applied to delineate the molecular and cellular mechanisms
underlying this novel neuroprotective therapy. The proposed study will provide another important step in the
development of our innovative disease-modifying treatment for PD."
10849932,"The problems of an aging society transcend the boundaries of any specific discipline and play
out across multiple biologic and societal domains. The six National Institute on Aging center
programs address these problems but typically from a specific disciplinary perspective. To
provide a mechanism to foster cross-disciplinary collaborations the Research Centers
Collaborative Network (RCCN) was established in 2008. It is led by the American Federation
for Aging Research and the Wake Forest School of Medicine. The RCCN addresses the
challenge of building multidisciplinary collaborations by employing 5 complementary strategies:
1) identifying intellectual opportunities that are best advanced by inter-center collaboration; 2)
stimulating the development of cross-center collaborations; 3) providing new opportunities for
early career researchers to expand their multidisciplinary collaborative network; and 4)
leveraging RCCN activities to bring additional resources to multidisciplinary aging research. Its
first two years were highly successful. In a highly praised workshop series, it brought together
key thought leaders from each of the 6 NIA center programs, offered didactic programs for early
career researchers, established a Webinar series, worked with NIA center coordinating centers
to coordinate activities and promote dissemination, and worked with the CTSA’s Inclusion of
Older Adults workgroup to increase recruitment of older adults to clinical research among other
achievements. Its goals going forward build on these achievements and introduce important
innovations and refinements. The RCCN’s specific aims for the next cycle are to: 1. Stimulate
cross-center collaboration through: a) Workshops focused on cross-cutting scientific themes
each relevant to 4 or more center programs; and b) Pilot grants supporting the initiation of
cross-center collaborations. 2. Provide educational opportunities for early career investigators
to build competencies in multidisciplinary and cross-institutional research. 3. Work with NIA
Center program coordinating centers and other NIA supported research networks to: a)
disseminate cutting edge multidisciplinary science; b) foster connections between the 6 NIA
center programs and other NIA-supported research networks; and c) develop tools, standards
and guidelines to promote multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional research. 4. Expand its
impact through fostering applications to foundations, the CTSA program and other potential
sponsors whose interests align with NIA Center programs. The RCCN employs multiple
evaluation strategies designed to strengthen and adapt its programs and to gauge its impact in
fostering multidisciplinary approaches to solving the problems facing older adults."
10909050,"Summary
Support is requested for training of 5 predoctoral trainee positions per year, in a university-wide visual science
training program at the systems, cellular, and molecular level. Training by thirty-six faculty mentors focuses on
analysis of visual processing, and cellular, molecular and genetic aspects of the normal and diseased eye, in
both basic science and disease-oriented research. Twenty-five faculty work in Systems and Computation on the
visual and oculomotor systems in humans, non-human primates, and other model systems, using
neurophysiology, psychophysics, behavioral analysis, brain imaging, and computational modeling (Section 1).
Six faculty in Section 2 (Development and Plasticity) focus on retinal cell specification and axon guidance, eye
development, the blood-retina barrier, and biophysics and plasticity of cortical dendrites and circuitry. Eight
faculty have research programs that touch on Molecular/genetic Approaches to the Normal and Diseased Eye
(Section 3) with primary interests in retinal degeneration, retinoid processing, and the genetics, diagnostics and
therapy of retinal disorders, with a focus on age-related macular degeneration and retinal edema. Although
mentors are in different departments (Biological Sciences, Psychology, Statistics, Biomedical Engineering and
Radiology, Ecology, Evolution and Environmental Biology on the Morningside campus; Neuroscience on the
Manhattanville campus; and Genetics, Ophthalmology, Pathology & Cell Biology, Neurology, Medicine and
Pediatrics on the medical school campus, multiple collaborations on interdisciplinary themes routinely support
training and advances on vision The research carried out by the mentors and trainees matches the goals in
NEI’s strategic plan for eye and vision research, including the Audacious Goals Initiative and 2020 Vision for the
Future. Suppport is sought for up to three years for predoctoral students who have chosen their lab and mentor
in vision studies. Trainees working on thesis projects related to the vision sciences are selected from selective
graduate programs such as the Doctoral Program in Neurobiology and Behavior, and Integrated Program in
Cellular, Molecular and Biomedical Sciences, both of which host MD-PhD students. Through activities such as
didactic courses, training in rigor and reproducabilty, thesis committees, symposia, seminars, and the Greater
New York Vision Club (VisioNYC), it is expected that faculty and trainees will interact, collaborate, and produce
a new generation of vision scientists who will elucidate information processing, development, and diseases of
the visual system."
10922727,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of this grant is to optimize hepatic histotripsy to create safe and effective ablation in any
location in a large animal, human-scale model. Liver cancer is a leading cause of death with
ablation one of the limited curative options in select patients. Unfortunately, currently available
ablation procedures have a variable local failure rate of ~10-40%. Also, tumors located near
critical structures, such as bile ducts and bowel, often do not receive curative treatment as thermal
ablation is associated with increased risk of injury. Histotripsy is the first non-invasive, non-
thermal, and non-ionizing ablation modality, using focused ultrasound energy to create cavitation,
resulting in mechanical tissue disruption. In preliminary studies, histotripsy has shown an ability
to cause tissue disruption that spares certain structures with collagenous architecture, including
bile ducts and bowel, and to create ablation zones with a thin margin between treated and normal
tissues. To catalyze the clinical translation of histotripsy and potentially increase the
number of patients eligible for curative treatment, a key question needs to be answered:
Can we leverage the potential safety advantages of histotripsy while maintaining efficacy
such that more tumors will be eligible for curative treatment? First, strategies to mitigate the
effects of respiratory motion by decreasing liver motion with high-frequency jet ventilation or using
in-suite cone-beam CT to model liver motion and modify prescriptions will be trialed in Aim 1. In
Aim 2 we will determine dose thresholds to treat excised HCC while sparing critical structures to
identify a safe, effective treatment dose for tumors of any location and then validate this dose in
a survival, in vivo swine liver model. Finally, in Aim 3 we will advance a SCID-like HCC porcine
liver tumor model, which will allow us to apply these strategies to tumors located within specific
high-risk locations of the liver to confirm safety and efficacy, ultimately, proving our hypothesis
that histotripsy can treat tumors in any liver location safely. The three Specific Aims are the
following. Aim 1: Determine the best strategy to mitigate the effects of respiratory motion to
increase the precision and safety of histotripsy ablation. Aim 2: To determine dose thresholds for
liver cancer and critical structures ex vivo, allowing a trial of safe, effective treatment parameters
for in vivo treatment in critical locations. Aim 3: Advance a highly relevant large animal liver HCC
model for medical devices and confirm safety and efficacy in this large animal model. This project
will yield critical preclinical data which will be necessary before the widespread adoption of
histotripsy to treat patients with non-surgical hepatocellular carcinoma."

Dr. Jessica Foster's career goal is to become a translational physician-scientist focused on immunotherapy for
pediatric brain tumors. This proposal describes a five-year plan to facilitate her transition to independence
through the acquisition of critical technical skills and scientific training in brain tumor modeling and evaluation
of the tumor microenvironment with single cell RNA sequencing, integrated with comprehensive mentoring
from a diverse team of faculty members. She will conduct the proposed studies under the proven mentorship of
Dr. John Maris, an international leader in translational neuroblastoma research and immunogenomics.
Additionally, her dedicated Advisory Committee is comprised of highly regarded physician-scientists with
diverse expertise in immunotherapy and pediatric brain tumors. Finally, the collaborative research environment
with unparalleled resources at the University of Pennsylvania and the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia
provides an ideal setting to conduct these translational studies.
Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a devastating pediatric brain tumor that remains incurable despite
decades of clinical trials, with a median survival of 11 months. This proposal seeks to use chimeric antigen
receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, a form of immunotherapy, to target DIPG. Recently GD2 was identified as an
immunotherapeutic target for DIPG, and lentiviral GD2-directed CAR T cells were able to successfully treat
murine models of DIPG. However, a significant number of mice treated with CAR T cells died due to
inflammation and herniation, prompting concerns for potential toxicity from this therapy, in particular in the
pons. This proposal is building upon the applicant's experience utilizing mRNA for the creation of CAR T cells
that are transient and can be titrated to effect to avoid toxicity, here using repeated local delivery of GD2-
directed mRNA CAR T cells to effectively treat DIPG while still maintaining safety. Aim 1 will determine the
effect of GD2-directed mRNA CAR T cells on tumor, microenvironment and normal tissue using both
immunocompetent and xenograft models of DIPG. Aim 2 will use single cell RNA sequencing to investigate the
role of microglia in DIPG development and test mRNA CAR T cells in combination with inhibition of microglia.
Dr. Foster's ultimate goal is to create a clinical trial for patients with DIPG using mRNA CAR T cells directed
against GD2, as well as generating a new treatment platform for all pediatric brain tumors. These efforts will
provide an outstanding foundation for her career as a physician-scientist and the development of an
independent translational research program."
10865007,"ABSTRACT
Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the USA and fibrosis is a common endpoint for most cardiac
diseases. Recent research has shown monocytes and macrophages are important mediators of heart fibrosis.
We found reduced levels of the transcription factor Fli1 in monocytes isolated from systemic sclerosis (SSc)
patients, an autoimmune connective tissue disease characterized by widespread tissue fibrosis and fibrotic
cardiomyopathy. Co-culture of human cardiac fibroblasts and Fli1 depleted monocytes resulted in potent
induction of galectin-3, and alternative activation markers in myeloid cells, and abundant collagen deposition by
fibroblasts, and this was blocked by the mTOR inhibitor Rapamycin. Preliminary experiments revealed that
deletion of Fli1 in monocytes/macrophages via Cre-mediated recombination using LysMCre mice
(LysMCre/Fli1fl/fl) predisposed mice to develop myocardial fibrosis.
Based on published data and our preliminary results, we hypothesize that Fli1 deficiency in macrophages
contributes to SSc fibrosis and cardiomyopathy, and that Rapamycin may block these effects. To test this
hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims:
Specific aim 1: Determine the molecular mechanism leading to fibrosis following Fli1 depletion in
monocytes/macrophages. We expect that decreased Fli1 in monocytes/macrophages will result in enhanced
migration, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, and will promote the production of extracellular matrix via Fli1/galetin-
3/mTOR pathway.
Specific aim 2: Determine whether loss of Fli1 in macrophages leads to cardiomyopathy in vivo. We
expect that the LysMCre/Fli1fl/fl mice will have enhanced inflammatory infiltrates, heart fibrosis and diastolic
dysfunction in response to Angiotensin II, which will be inhibited by Rapamycin.
Specific aim 3. Investigate whether myeloid Fli1 has a role in SSc-associated cardiomyopathy. We expect
that monocytes and macrophages from SSc patients with cardiomyopathy will display a similar phenotype to the
LysMCre/Fli1fl/fl macrophages.
The studies proposed should allow us to gain better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of heart fibrosis
in SSc, and determine whether future treatments for SSc-cardiomyopathy, should target Fli1 and the myeloid
system via Rapamycin, thus providing the basis for potentially safer, more effective therapies."
10793580,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Approximately 25% of diabetic patients experience diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs). This is a significant clinical
problem since there are no effective biomarkers for predicting outcomes, no drug candidates that have recently
been FDA-approved and no therapies that are widely effective in treatment. Additionally, the prevalence of
diabetes and non-healing DFUs are highest among minorities, such as in Native American and Hispanic
populations, and associated with social deprivation and high mortality.
The University of Arizona (UArizona) is the leading public research university in the American Southwest and an
ideal transdisciplinary research community for studying DFU healing. The partnership between UArizona and
Banner Health provided service to 5,680 patients with open wounds last year. Ranging from trauma to podiatry,
Banner Health saw 3,770 individuals with diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) in the past 3 years. Dr. Geoffrey Gurtner
has an established history in studying both late-stage biomarker validation through clinical trials and also
mechanistic and early-stage biomarkers identification through the collection of many high-quality biosamples
and longitudinal data (Aim 1). This is supported by both the large patient population at UArizona as well as Dr.
Gurtner’s history in identifying rate cell subpopulations in DFU samples collected from human patients.
Next, we aim to create a unified Standard of Care through the execution of high-quality clinical trials for DFUs,
which historically have been difficult to recruit, and also by collecting high-quality data to address the
heterogeneity of DFUs with complex pathologies, co-morbidities, and social factors. At UArizona, Dr. Gurtner
and Dr. Zhou conduct high-quality clinical trials and have access to a wide distribution of patients and a range of
techniques to make sure that “No DFU Patient Goes Unstudied” (Aim 2). Next, our diverse patient pool will allow
us to specifically understand how social and environmental contextual factors (“social determinants of health”;
SDH) may affect diabetic healing and biomarkers, specifically be recruiting over a diverse and expansive patient
pool (Aim 3). Finally, we have access to not just the entire Banner Health Network (BHN), but also to the Indian
Health Network and outreach programs for Latino communities. Through this expansive network that
incorporates people of all demographics and socio-economic statuses, we will establish effective collaborations
between the CRU and new clinical sites to generate cooperative problem-solving and high-level training, with
shared resources and values (Aim 4)."

10912633,"Project Summary
Lengthening the small intestine is a potentially curative therapy for patients with intestinal failure due to short
bowel syndrome. Short bowel syndrome is the end result of devastating diseases that affect the small intestine.
Patients with short bowel syndrome have malabsorption and cannot eat normal meals. The current therapy for
short bowel syndrome consists of providing parenteral nutrition, optimizing the health of the remnant intestine,
and enhancing intestinal adaptation. While parenteral nutrition has dramatically improved their survival, many
patients with short bowel syndrome cannot be weaned from parenteral nutrition and develop end stage liver
disease. Over the last decade, we developed and refined devices to lengthen the small intestine. By applying a
gradual force to a segment of the small intestine separated from continuity, we were able to triple the length of
the small intestine in rats and pigs. There was a net growth of the intestinal cell mass and an increase in the
absorptive surface area. The lengthened segment was functional when it was restored back into intestinal
continuity. These studies demonstrated the potential of mechanical intestinal lengthening as a novel treatment
of patients with short bowel syndrome. In this proposed research, we will obtain data on spring devices that will
lengthen the intestine that are still in intestinal continuity in different size animals. We will also develop ways to
maximize intestinal lengthening with multiple springs applied repeatedly. Lastly, we will employ the spring in a
porcine short bowel model. If successful, these studies will lead to a Phase 1 clinical trial of these devices in
patients with short bowel syndrome. This approach will revolutionize the treatment strategy of patients with
short bowel syndrome."

 The Enteroid Core (EC) is a multi-service resource that provides Program Project and Core Investigators and
their laboratories the tools and advice needed to establish and utilize human intestinal stem cell-derived
enteroids/colonoids for understanding the pathogenesis of enteric bacterial infections. The Enteroid Core
provides established enteroid and colonoid cultures from JHU biobank, expertise and training in the use of human
small intestinal and colonic enteroid monolayers, growth factor-conditioned media required for propagation,
maintenance, and differentiation of enteroid cultures, including M cells, as well as assistance in troubleshooting
growth, differentiation, and use of enteroids for study of host-pathogen interactions in each project. The Enteroid
Core works in close collaboration with the Immunology Core to develop novel co-culture models of human
enteroids/colonoids with primary human innate immune cells. Our collaborative work during the current award
period resulted in the first human immune-enteroid co-culture model that included monocyte-derived
macrophages. In addition, the Enteroid Core developed techniques and protocols to assist Project laboratories
achieve their proposed Aims including lentiviral transduction of human enteroids/colonoids for stable knockdown
(via shRNA) of target genes (e.g. MUC2 for Project 1 (EAEC); MRP5 for Project 3 (ETEC)) and differentiation of
specialized intestinal epithelial cell types (e.g. M cells for Project 2 (Shigella)). This renewal application seeks to
continue these collaborative efforts to provide Projects 2 (Shigella) and 3 (ETEC) and the Immunology Core with
media necessary for propagating human enteroids/colonoids and growing them as monolayers as well as media
to normally differentiate enteroids/colonoids as well as to express M cells (Project 2 (Shigella)). Project 1 (EAEC)
investigators have been trained to make conditioned media independently and will receive quality control support
from the EC. The EC will continue to help with troubleshooting problems with culturing enteroids as well as use
of enteroids for each project. In collaboration with the Immunology Core, the EC will continue developing innate
immune cell-enteroid co-culture models to include human monocyte-derived dendritic cells and intraepithelial
lymphocytes. In addition to new co-culture models, the EC and Immunology Core will increase the complexity of
co-cultures through increased direct physical interaction of enteroid monolayers with immune cells normally
present in the lamina propria, using commercially available 3D cell culture scaffolds, perfusion systems, and
recently developed anaerobic chamber used for human enteroid monolayers."
10868680,"IMMUNOLOGY CORE – ABSTRACT
Diarrheal disease is the second leading cause of death in children under five years of age. Understanding the
processes involved in bacterial pathogenesis and host response to enteric pathogens is essential to improve
treatment and develop effective prevention strategies. Such studies have been hindered by the lack of reliable
models that fully recapitulate the complex cellular and molecular events and interactions that take place in the
human gut. The Immunology Core (IC) will establish and refine co-culture models of human intestinal epithelial
and innate immune cells to recreate the tissue structure, cell interaction, and coordinated responses of the
human gut. This physiologically relevant system will generate new insights into the coordinated actions of
epithelial and immune cells during enteric infections. The IC will also support the studies performed by the
projects by providing technical expertise for implementation of immune co-cultures. The IC has two main Aims.
Aim 1. As a core developmental Aim, the IC will: 1) Refine the enteroid-immune cell co-culture by seeding
epithelial cell monolayers on a collagen-coated porous scaffold (i.e. Alvetex®) that will allow direct cell-to-cell
contact and migration. 2) Establish a multi-cellular model consisting of epithelial cell monolayers co-cultured with
different innate phagocytic cells: monocyte-derived macrophages (MF), polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN),
and dendritic cells (DC) isolated from human peripheral blood. Phagocytic cells not only perform anti-microbial
functions but also initiate adaptive immunity. We have successfully engrafted human phagocytes individually to
enteroid monolayers. To better recreate individual and synergistic function of epithelial and innate immune cells,
we will combine these three main phagocytic lineages with enteroid monolayers. Tissue structure and integration,
cell phenotype, viability, and functionality will be assessed by histology, confocal microscopy, flow cytometry and
microarray technology. Phagocytic activity, transmigration and cytokine and chemokine production will be
examined to determine cell function. 3) Develop a co-culture model containing epithelial cells and TCRgd+ T cells
from human peripheral blood. TCRgd+ T cells within the mucosal barrier, also known as intraepithelial
lymphocytes (IEL), are rapidly mobilized and deploy diverse innate immune functions in response to pathogens.
Cell phenotype will be characterized by flow cytometry, and function will be assessed by cytokine production and
cell cytotoxicity. Tissue structure will be examined by histology and microscopy. Cell movement will be monitored
with particle tracking system/software and confocal microscopy. Optimal conditions for the generation of immune
co-cultures will be defined, and protocols produced and made available to the research projects.
Aim 2. As a support service Aim, the IC will write detailed protocols to implement the methods described above
and will provide training and technical assistance to facilitate the experimental work of the individual projects.
Collectively, the work proposed will generate new knowledge on enteric infection and immunity that can inform
prophylactic and therapeutic development efforts."

Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) is an important pathogen of traveler's diarrhea, diarrhea in industrialized
countries and growth faltering in developing countries. In this application, we propose to study the role of highly
prevalent serine proteases from the SPATE family in EAEC pathogenesis, and their relationship with chronic
inflammatory enteropathy using a newly established human leukocyte-colonoid model. This application
comprises a consortium among investigators at Johns Hopkins University (JHU), who have pioneered the
development of the enteroid/colonoid model, and researchers at the University of Maryland (UMB) and the
University of Virginia (UVA), who are leaders in the study of the pathogenesis of diarrheal disease caused by
diarrhegenic E. coli and Shigella. We have successfully used the colonoid model to characterize relevant
features of EAEC pathogenesis, highlighting the important role of the lectin-like serine protease Pic in intestinal
colonization and inflammation. In this project will leverage the existence of the newly developed leukocyte-
colonoid monolayer model to characterize the modulatory activity of Pic and other serine proteases in goblet
cells, leukocytes and epithelial cells in EAEC pathogenesis. This project will comprise three Specific Aims. In
Aim 1, we will characterize the effect of Pic in goblet cell function by obtaining mechanistic insights into Pic-
mediated MUC2 exocytosis and by establishing the role of the goblet-cell secreted serine protease inhibitor
WFDC2 in EAEC pathogenesis by using unbiased transcriptomics and pharmacological approaches. In Aim 2,
we will characterize the role of SPATEs in EAEC-induced epithelial inflammation by obtaining mechanistic
insights into MUC1-mediated epithelial inflammation in EAEC infection, employing gene silencing and
pharmacological approaches. In Aim 3, we will characterize the immunomodulatory property of Pic lectin and
mucinolytic activity on leukocyte functions in EAEC pathogenesis employing neutrophils- and macrophages-
colonoids co-cultures along with state-of-the-art time-lapse microscopy, flow cytometry and Luminex-based
assays. This work will continue to advance our understanding of EAEC pathogenesis, generating fundamental
insights that will illuminate aspects of pathogenesis relevant to other enteric pathogens, and could open up new
avenues for therapeutic intervention. We will work closely and synergistically with investigators in other projects
and the Core components."

causing an estimated 163 million cases and >74,000 deaths per year. The greatest impact is in children
under 5 years of age in developing countries where Shigella was identified as the most important pathogen
causing diarrhea in 12-59 month old children. The widespread isolation of multiple drug resistant isolates
limiting therapeutic interventions and the continued high levels of endemic disease underscore the
significance of Shigella as a global health priority and reinforce the need for preventative interventions and
vaccine development. Infection with Shigella results in diarrhea and dysentery following transcytosis of the
epithelial barrier, invasion of gastrointestinal cells, intracellular replication and induction of a severe
inflammatory response. Interaction with host innate immune cells including macrophages (MΦ), dendritic
cells (DCs) and intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) are critical events in progression of disease symptoms as
well as in initiation of a protective immune response. The human enteroid model provides a highly human
relevant multicellular system that recapitulates important aspects of gastrointestinal physiology. Advances
during the first P01 funding cycle included the addition of M cells and immune cell co-culture in enteroids.
This complex model provides a system in which critical features of Shigella uptake, transcytosis, and
engagement with immune cells can be identified which may serve as targets for interventional strategies.
Using a series of isogenic Shigella strains with mutations in key virulence factors, we aim to define bacterial
requirements for each stage of host engagement. Furthermore, the evaluation of a series of live attenuated
vaccine strains that have been studied clinically will serve as tools to further understand bacterial
requirements for the pathogenic process and allow determination of the utility of this model to distinguish
promising vaccine candidates. Building on our current capability of M cell incorporation, we will use the M
cell enteroid model to characterize sequential stages of Shigella-host interactions including the process of
uptake and transcytosis, and subsequent interaction with critical innate immune cells. These studies will
reveal novel aspects of host-pathogen interactions and ensuing innate immune responses to this pathogen
that better reflect what occurs in humans; new insights will be provided that will guide intervention strategies."
10868689,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The bacterial pathogen enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) contributes to the global burden of diarrheal disease
because vaccine protection and therapy remain inadequate. A long-term goal is to improve knowledge of
innate immune responses to ETEC infection, as they are likely important for initiating durable adaptive
immunity. The objective of this project is to understand the innate immune defenses employed by human
intestine to sense and eliminate ETEC, thus informing strategies for vaccine and/or drug design. We will (Aim
1) characterize the recognition and response mechanisms employed by tissue resident macrophages and
neutrophils against ETEC infection. In a complementary inquiry, we will (Aim 2) assess antimicrobial peptides
(AMPs) released by epithelial and immune cells in response to ETEC that could serve as potential treatment.
These aims will be explored in primary co-culture models of human small intestinal epithelium (tissue-derived
enteroids) and immune cell types from peripheral blood that are assembled on scaffolds to facilitate
physiologically relevant crosstalk between bacteria, epithelia, and immune cell populations. Model
development, application of anaerobic environment to mimic conditions in the intestinal lumen, and
characterization will combine the expertise of the Enteroid and Immunology Cores that support this P01. The
proposed studies are significant in that they will indicate the molecular signal transduction involved in reacting
to and resolving ETEC infection without clinically overt inflammation, an understudied aspect of acute
pathogenic diarrheal disease. Results from these studies will be compared to findings from enteroaggregative
E. coli and Shigella pathogenesis proposals in this P01 to identify common effectors for therapeutic targeting.
The projects of this P01 will cumulatively innovate human primary epithelial and immune cell co-culture
strategies for host-pathogen research."
10915028,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT - Methods Core
The Methods Core will advance the scientific mission of CAPS by maximizing the scientific
rigor of the research conducted by CAPS scientists via promoting the use of optimal
methods, new tools, and best practices. Scientific methods make it possible for CAPS
scientists to conduct research of the highest caliber to help end the HIV epidemic. However, it
can be difficult for CAPS scientists to determine which research methods and technologies
from a continually growing list best suit the needs of particular research questions and
projects. Given the increasing number of study designs, data sources, data analysis
approaches, and the growing complexity of these methods and technologies, the Methods
Core will ensure that CAPS investigators are equipped to meet these challenges, particularly
for addressing the priority thematic areas for CAPS: identifying the co-occurring and
multiplicative factors that interact to affect HIV and its co-presence with other health
conditions and understanding and improving health delivery systems. The Core will promote
optimal use of rigorous methods leading to high impact studies via these specific aims: (1)
Promote use of rigorous study designs and support, train, and consult on research designs
and methods; (2) Foster and leverage use of emergent technologies and multiple data
sources in HIV research; and (3) Foster use of advanced analytic and mixed methods in HIV
research. The Methods Core will also continue to provide its foundational services, which
include: (1) consulting on refining research questions, study design, measures, data sources,
sample size, and methods of analysis; (2) optimizing presentation of research methods and
results in NIH grant proposals, conference presentations, peer-reviewed articles, and
communications to communities affected by HIV; and (3) participating in internal, pre-
submission peer reviews of grant proposals and manuscripts, responses to extramural
reviews, and resubmissions. In addition to helping scientists choose rigorous approaches
from an ever-increasing array of study designs and data collection, storage, and analysis
options, the Core will also share with CAPS scientists evolving best practices on data de-
identification for preserving participant confidentiality in the context increasing requirements
by journal outlets for distribution of data for public access. Through these activities, the
Methods Core will contribute crucially to the rigorous research needed to end the HIV
epidemic."
10915030,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – Community Engagement (CE) Core
The Community Engagement (CE) Core advances the scientific mission of CAPS by closing
the gap between research and practice. Engaging the community in research to address
policies, practices, and programs relevant to their well-being is critical to ending the HIV
epidemic and ensuring that the full prevention and care toolbox is accessible to all. CAPS will
base its CE activities on substantial theory and evidence, guided by the UK National Institute
for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) Community Engagement framework, to promote
the mutual and bidirectional exchange of information, ideas, and expertise between
community members and researchers. The Core proposes to carry out three aims: (1)
Connect high-impact HIV science to communities (scientist à community); (2) Integrate
community perspectives into high-impact HIV science (community àscientist); and (3) Foster
community-engaged research (communityßà scientist). The CE Core will increase community
access, both domestic and international, to CAPS's innovative HIV research by implementing
evidence-based translation strategies, by reviewing, synthesizing, translating, and broadly
disseminating cross-cutting HIV research findings. The CE Core will also support the CAPS
Community Advisory Board to provide community input to strengthen the design,
implementation, and dissemination of research findings, especially considering the co-
occurring and multiplicative factors that underlie HIV health disparities and by including those
working in traditional and nontraditional HIV-related health systems. And the CE Core will
strengthen the capacity of CAPS scientists and community stakeholders to participate
collaboratively in CE research on HIV, including research on co-occurring and multiplicative
factors resulting in HIV health disparities, and research on health systems. Through its
activities, the CE Core will help CAPS scientists thoughtfully engage with communities to
formulate and conduct research projects, interpret and disseminate the findings, and foster
research that is prioritized by, meaningful to, and respectful of people affected by HIV."
10897067,"ABSTRACT
The CDC recommends that persons living with HIV (PWH) be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. However,
there are minimal scientific data to support this important public health principle in relation to ongoing
immune dysfunction and chronic comorbidities and the persistent HIV reservoir in antiretroviral treated (ART)
PWH. We propose that a formal, comprehensive, longitudinal study in a well-characterized cohort of male
and female PWH compared to HIV uninfected controls (HUC) is essential to assess the immunogenicity
of COVID-19 vaccines in PWH. The MACS-WIHS Combined Cohort Study (MWCCS) is ideal for analyzing
the interactive impact of chronic HIV infection on COVID-19 Pfizer and Moderna RNA-based vaccine
immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 and the HIV reservoir. In Aim 1, we propose to conduct an in-
depth analysis of antibody neutralizing function and B lymphocyte responses in 100 male PWH and 100
female vaccinated PWH, and 25 male and 25 female vaccinated HUC, from the MWCCS. In Aim 2, we will
extensively characterize immune cell phenotypes, soluble markers, and functional cellular immune
responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in the participants from Aim 1 before and after vaccination. In Aim 3,
we will evaluate the effects of COVID-19 vaccine on the persistent HIV reservoir (amount and composition,
immune parameters) before and after immunization. Aim 4 applies machine learning approaches on the
entire set of features quantified in Aims 1-3 to predict COVID-19 vaccine response outcomes and
determine the critical parameters that influence vaccine responses. We believe that this study is unique,
important, and critically timely for assessing the scientifically unprecedented, vaccine prevention
phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in the context of HIV infection."
10897984,"Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) is a major cause of bacterial infectious diarrhea in children, travelers and deployed
military personnel in risk areas. As such, development of a vaccine would be advantageous for public health.
One strategy is to use subunits of colonization factors combined with toxoids of heat-labile toxin (LT). Recently,
a first-in-humans safety and immunogenicity Phase 1 vaccine trial (NCT03404674) was conducted. with dose-
escalating intramuscular delivery of CS6-subunit antigen CssBA combined with LT-R192G/L211A (dmLT). No
serious adverse events were reported and we observed strong humoral immunogenicity in several cohorts,
notably related to dmLT dose. Yet a complete analysis of clinical trial samples, including humoral and cellular
memory is lacking. As this vaccine trial indicates, dmLT is not only an LT toxoid but also a potent adjuvant that
stimulates immunity to co-delivered antigens; however, there is a gap in our understanding of molecular
mechanisms responsible for initiating vaccination outcomes with antigens co-delivered with dmLT.
The objective of this proposal is to expand analysis on serum and PBMC samples from an ETEC Phase 1 clinical
trial and to define the key biomarkers and molecular mechanisms directing vaccine outcomes. In the proposed
studies we aim to explore (1) how vaccination doses modulated development of memory, longevity and diversity
of the humoral response; (2) how vaccination altered development of durable cellular immunity; (3) whether early
signaling events can serve as biomarkers of immunity; and (4) what molecular mechanisms during immunization
shape vaccination outcomes.
To do so we will analyze our stored clinical trial samples and perform a number of sophisticated analyses,
including transcriptional and metabolomics assays using samples from a related ETEC Phase 2b vaccine-
efficacy trail to define signatures of vaccine induced protection which we will then validate using the Phase 1 trial
samples. In addition, we will validate findings with cellular analyses and mouse models. These findings will help
with the development of an ETEC vaccine for human use by parenteral route and also provide mechanistic
insight into key events directing vaccination outcomes."
10906794,"Urine cadmium and risk of fracture and bone loss
Abstract
Osteoporosis and related fractures are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States and globally.
Mechanistic studies from bone organ and cell culture systems suggest cadmium (Cd) mobilizes bone minerals
from skeletal tissue. Cd is a heavy metal and natural element found in soil, with increasing concentrations linked
to phosphate fertilizers and sewage sludge found in croplands. As a result, human dietary exposures have
increased over time by 26% dating from 1990 through 2003. In addition, Cd has increased in human bones ten-
fold since pre-industrial times. Following intake, Cd is stored in the kidney, where it remains for decades (half-
life: 10-30 years). A small portion of Cd is slowly excreted in the urine, making urinary Cd (U-Cd) a well-
established biomarker of long-term exposure. Cross-sectional studies have linked Cd to low bone mineral
density, osteoporosis, and fracture, suggesting a potential population attributable fraction of 30% assuming there
is a causal relationship. However, currently lacking are large prospective studies.
We propose to leverage existing samples and data from the two largest prospective US osteoporosis cohort
studies to perform an in depth study of U-Cd, bone loss, and fractures that will include long-term follow-up of
up to 20 years using: 1) The Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS) Study and 2) the Study of Osteoporotic
Fractures (SOF). Aim 1: Using efficient case-cohort study designs we will investigate the prospective
association between U-Cd and incident fractures in 1,321 MrOS men and 1,578 SOF women who will be sex
matched with 1500 randomly selected persons from each respective cohort. Cd, creatinine, osmolality, and
cotinine will be analyzed in urine. Aim 2: Evaluate the prospective association between U-Cd and rate of loss
of total hip bone mineral density (BMD) in men and women from the subcohorts, and in incident fracture cases.
Aim 3: Utilize markers of bone metabolism and structure to provide novel insights into the cellular and structural
mechanisms by which Cd may adversely affect bone. Evaluate the association between U-Cd and markers of
bone formation (PINP) and bone resorption (CTX) in men and women. In a substudy using data already available
in men, evaluate the association between U-Cd and bone structure (HR-pQCT). Also, in an exploratory subAim,
apply mediation analyses using a counterfactual framework based approach to estimate the extent to which Cd’s
influence on bone loss might be mediated via biomarkers of bone metabolism (serum PINP, CTX).
A large fraction of older US men and women have documented Cd exposure. Highly accurate measures of Cd
exposure linked to powerful epidemiological cohorts provide a unique, cost effective approach to this important
public health issue. These studies will transform the field of Cd-bone research and have high potential to impact
policy decisions in the US and globally."
10908577,"In striated muscles, actin thin filament architecture is critical for efficient contractile activity, and
alterations in thin filament integrity are linked to severe and often lethal skeletal and cardiac
muscle diseases. Our long-term goal is to identify the components and molecular mechanisms
regulating actin architecture in striated muscle during normal development and disease. Our
short-term goal is to evaluate how actin-binding proteins of the tropomodulin family (e.g. leiomodin
or Lmod and tropomoduin or Tmod) affect the formation and then the structure of the thin filament.
We will test our recently proposed molecular mechanism for the Lmod/Tmod-dependent
regulation of the pointed end of the thin filaments. We will also study the structural and functional
consequences of Lmod binding to sides of the already formed thin filaments. Finally, we will
establish mechanisms of regulation of Lmod functions. We propose three aims to identify
underlying molecular mechanisms of the full spectrum of Lmod and Tmod functions: (1) to
decipher the role of Lmod in the maintenance of proper thin filament lengths via pointed end
regulation; (2) to establish the role of Lmod’s actin-binding sites in thin filament activation; (3) to
test the hypothesis that Lmod functions are regulated by Ca2+. By employing high resolution
cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) in conjunction with 3-dimensional nuclear magnetic
resonance and Förster resonance energy transfer), we will recreate the full picture of Ca2+-
dependent Lmod interactions with the thin filament and reveal the biological significance of these
interactions. The robustness of structural models will be evaluated by monitoring of development
and contractility of cardiac and skeletal muscles in knockout mice in vivo via the identification and
utilization of mutations specifically affecting newly discovered Lmod’s and Tmod’s functionalities.
To achieve these goals, we established a powerful multidisciplinary collaboration between the
Kostyukova laboratory at the Washington State University (expert in protein structure, biochemical
and biophysical properties of actin-binding proteins), the Gregorio laboratory at the University of
Arizona (expert in the molecular, cellular and developmental biology of myofibril assembly) and
the Galkin laboratory at the Eastern Virginia Medical School (expert in high resolution cryo-EM of
actin complexes). Our data will provide a comprehensive identification of critical components of
the regulatory mechanisms underlying thin filament assembly and maintenance in health and
disease."

Despite many years of discussion, research, and efforts to promote change, a great disparity remains between
the presence of African American, Hispanic, Native American, People with Disabilities, and other
underrepresented minority (URM) faculty at US research universities and their representation in the US
population. This reality is no less true in the neurosciences than in other disciplines. Moreover, URMs who do
achieve faculty status appear to achieve traditional measures of success at a lower rate than do their majority
counterparts. Although data on publications and funding rates appear to be lacking, there is a striking absence
of URMs in visible positions of prominence as full professors or chairs at universities and as symposia speakers,
journal editors, or societal officers. We believe that these two problems are related – that if those URMs who are
faculty become more successful in regard to those measures, this in turn will stimulate an influx of other URMs
into faculty ranks. Our evaluation of available programs in the US indicates that there are limited opportunities
to adequately assist early career URM faculty in overcoming these difficulties, and it is this problem that we seek
to address through the Center for Underrepresented Research in Addiction (CURA) to promote the advancement
of junior faculty members in drug addiction research at research universities. Defining success for such faculty
in terms of quality and quantity of manuscripts, grants submitted, and funded, visibility at the national level,
mentoring of others by the participants, and promotion, we propose to establish a program based on the following
hypothesis: The success of early career URM faculty in drug addiction research can be increased substantially
by an intensive individualized educational program focused on (1) and individualized career development plan
and the identification of a team of relevant mentors (2) strong instruction in professional skills and the responsible
conduct of research (RCR), (3) individualized and frequent mentoring by senior established faculty (4)
development of an expanded network and peer-mentoring, and (5) the promotion and enhancement of the career
of URM faculty at their own institutions. To test this hypothesis, we will develop the CURA program to advance
the career of URM faculty. We will recruit 10 early career URM faculty in drug addiction research each year for
five years who have great promise for success. We will then develop career development programs for each
participant and together the participant and mentoring team will develop a career development plan. To facilitate
that plan we will establish a one-year educational program consisting of (a) workshops, (b) strong mentoring, (c)
attendance at professional scientific meetings, (d) assistance in the expansion of their network, and (e)
mechanisms to promote communication and peer-mentoring among the participants. The impact of our efforts
will be evaluated and the results disseminated at meetings and in publications. We believe that this approach
will have a significant impact on the success of early career URM faculty in the neurosciences and will serve as
a model for programs in other areas of academia."

(RBS) training of alcohol servers has shown promise. RBS training is currently required or incentivized by 36 U.S.
states and California will require it starting in 2022. Our team has shown that an online RBS training, named
WayToServe®, was effective in two randomized trials. These results filled a gap in the literature on RBS training
that is limited by the lack of randomized trials, poor measurement of training implementation, and almost
exclusive focus on live training when online training predominates. The goal of this SBIR Fast-track research is
to develop and test an in-service professional development component for alcohol servers trained by
WayToServe to improve its effectiveness. It is intended to motivate servers to implement the RBS skills in the
face of common barriers, provide support for RBS actions from a “community” of alcohol servers, and prevent
natural degradation of skills over time. Rationale for this product is provided by past research showing that
training, certification, and in-service contact improves professionalism and efficacy of community prevention
interventions. Scientific premise is provided by the positive results of our trials on the WayToServe® training.
The in-service component will be delivered through the WayToServe Facebook page that currently is “followed”
by over 20,000 alcohol servers trained by WayToServe. The specific aims of Phase I are to: 1) develop content of
in-service professional development on RBS skills with a) premises owners/ managers interviews and b) alcohol
servers in New Mexico and Washington State trained by the WayToServe online RBS training through focus
group discussions; 2) produce a prototype WayToServe Plus in-service professional development component in
flowcharts and an initial library of Facebook posts, including text, graphics, and interactive elements and
evaluate it for acceptability, usability, and engagement in focus groups and field pilot trial with alcohol servers in
New Mexico and Washington State trained by the WayToServe online RBS training, and 3) determine feasibility
of WayToServe Plus in-service professional development component and develop evaluation plans for Phase II
research. Milestones will be an EAB-approved Phase I research plans and development of the content outline and
WayToServe Plus prototype, evaluation of WayToServe Plus prototype, and feasibility assessment of the
WayToServe Plus in-service professional development component. Phase II specific aims will achieve the
milestones of full production of WayToServe Plus and a randomized trial testing its effectiveness by: 4)
producing the full WayToServe Plus in-service professional development component and 5) conducting a
randomized trial with 160 alcohol premises in New Mexico and Washington State evaluating effectiveness of
WayToServe Plus on refusal of sales to PiP (primary outcome). The SBIR research is innovative as WayToServe
Plus will be the first continuous in-service professional development for RBS and will increase the WayToServe
training's effectiveness and commercial advantage with alcohol servers and corporate clients."

The primary objective of the Biospecimen and Pathology Core of the Wistar/UPenn SPORE in Skin Cancer is to
provide a centralized facility focused on procurement, processing, analysis and distribution of malignant and
normal tissue in support of translational cancer research, particularly melanoma research. The Core has been
an effective resource for all SPORE projects in the prior funding period, which were heavily tissue-dependent,
and will continue to provide essential support services for the proposed SPORE Projects moving forward. The
Core will collect, store and process high-quality and well-annotated biospecimens (blood, fresh and paraffin
embedded tissue) of tumor and normal tissue using SOPs modified in a Project specific manner (Aim 1). We will
expand and maintain a functional multi-institutional integrated biospecimen and clinical database that includes
pathological, treatment, recurrence, and follow-up data as well as comprehensive acquisition and distribution
data associated with the use of tissue. The already existing database supports horizontal, vertical and inter-
SPORE collaborations (Aim 2). We will select and distribute high quality biospecimens. We have developed
procedures to select, prepare and distribute well-annotated tissues from benign, primary and metastatic tumors;
DNA, RNA and proteins from biospecimens according to the specifications of each project. Distribution is
governed by guidelines developed by the Tissue Resource Allocation Committee (TRAC) to ensure efficient and

10912740,"Abstract
Toward precision medicine and precision disease prevention, the overarching goal of this proposal is to
develop innovative statistical methods for accurate risk prediction. We address three challenges that
plague studies on the value of candidate risk predictors that adds to established predictors for improved
predictive accuracy: there is often a lack of independent validation data, the source population for the
study sample and the target population of prediction are often different, no statistical methods are
currently available for developing risk prediction models using individually-matched case-control data,
and there is a lack of statistical methods for helping assess study feasibility beyond standard power
calculation for testing predictor-outcome association. On the other hand, data and information that are
external to the study may well exist and can be exploited to alleviate these challenges. For example, a
model with only standard predictors often exists and has been validated, and the distribution of standard
risk predictors in the target population of prediction is often available. We propose that external data and
information can be exploited to address the above-mentioned challenges for candidate predictor
evaluation, and develop innovative statistical methods to bring this idea to fruition. Considering
prediction of a binary outcome, we propose a novel method to building logistic prediction models that are
guaranteed to calibrate well in the target population, an innovative method for risk prediction with
individually matched case-control data, and a method to project the added value of candidate predictors to
help assess study feasibility. Our methods, accompanied by user-friendly software, will facilitate cost
effective and timely predictor evaluation for predicting binary outcomes. Our methods were motivated by
and will be applied to several PI Chen's collaborative studies."

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a chronic lung disease characterized by increased pulmonary artery
pressure leading to right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy, RV failure and death. The incidence of PAH is much
higher in female patients (4:1 ratio). While previous studies investigating sex differences in PAH have focused
extensively on the role of gonadal hormones, in particular estrogen, we are the first lab to investigate the role of
sex chromosomes in PAH. Our recent published work using innovative mouse models demonstrated in the
absence of sex hormones, the Y chromosome (ChrY) protects against experimental pulmonary hypertension
(PH), indicating that gene(s) encoded on ChrY can protect against PH. Only 4 genes on ChrY are expressed in
the lungs Uty, Kdm5d, Eif2s3y, and Ddx3y. Our preliminary data identified Uty as the top candidate gene
responsible for ChrY protection against PH. Additionally, we demonstrate that Uty expression is reduced in male
patients with PAH and multiple animal models of PH. Our RNAseq analysis on the lungs of PH wildtype (WT)
and Uty-KD male mice revealed a few promising targets including the proinflammatory cytokines Cxcl9 and
Cxcl10. Our preliminary data shows Uty co-localizes with Cxcl9/10 in lung macrophages, and expression of
Cxcl9/10 is significantly increased in bone marrow derived macrophages isolated from Uty global KO mice
compared to WT. More importantly, our pilot study shows that blocking the shared Cxcl9/10 receptor, Cxcr3,
using AMG487 can reduce PH severity in female rats with PH. Our bioinformatics analysis also identified
Endothelin-2 (ET-2) is up-regulated in the lung as a result of Uty-KD. The role of ET-2 is currently unknown in
PAH. For the first time, we show that increased ET-2 expression may contribute to worsening PH by inhibiting
angiogenesis and promoting SMC proliferation in the lung. Our working hypotheses are: (1) ChrY gene Uty
protects against PH development; (2) loss or absence of Uty results in more severe PH through increased
expression of Cxcl9/10 and ET-2 resulting in vascular EC death, SMC proliferation and pathological
angiogenesis; and (3) Blocking Cxcl9/10 alone or together with blocking ET-2 activity reduces the severity of PH
in a sex-specific manner. Aim 1. To examine whether knockdown of Uty in the lungs, in the presence and
absence of hormones, abolishes the protective role of ChrY in experimental PH; Aim 2. Investigate the
mechanistic role of the Uty/Cxcl9/10 and Uty/ET-2 axes in PH pathogenesis; Aim 3. Determine if blocking the
activity of downstream Uty genes Cxcl9/10 alone or together with blocking ET-2 rescues PH development by
reducing EC apoptosis and SMC proliferation and promoting angiogenesis in male and female rats."

Most clinical trial designs use \one-size- ts-all"" rules for treatment assignment and evaluation based on models that
ignore patient heterogeneity. This is disconnected from medical practice, where physicians use each patient's diagnosis
and prognostic variables to make personalized, precision medicine treatment decisions. Modern precision medicine
exploits biotechnologies such as proteomics, genomics, gene sequencing, mass spectrometry, or cytometry methods
that evaluate multiple cell surface markers. These generate vectors of biomarkers that may be used to re ne existing
disease subgroup de nitions, construct new disease classi cations, and formulate clinical trial designs and statistical
rules for personalized/precision treatment assignment. In oncology and other disease areas, there is rapidly increasing
development of new biotherapies, including cell therapies, immunotherapies, and targeted molecular agents. A biotherapy
may be administered once or in multiple cycles; used in combination with conventional treatments such as cytotoxic
chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery; and often generates complex outcomes, such as repeatedly evaluated tumor status,
multiple biological variables, and occurrence times of both early and late onset toxicities. This complicates the de nitions
of \response"" and \toxicity,"" and produces multidimensional treatment e ects that may di er between subgroups. An
example is a phase I-II trial to optimize subgroup-speci c doses of donor derived natural killer (NK) cells for treating
B-cell hematologic malignancies, where donated NK cells are engineered using chimeric antigen receptors to enhance
their cancer killing e ects, then expanded using growth factors to obtain cell doses large enough for therapeutic use.
Subgroups may be de ned using disease subtypes and prognostic variables. Co-primary outcomes may include ordinal
disease status, including complete or partial remission, stable disease, or disease progression, evaluated either once or at
monthly intervals; time to severe NK cell-related toxicity, such as cytokine release syndrome; and a binary indicator of
100-day survival. Considering (biotherapy, dose, administration schedule) a treatment regime, a clinical trial of one or
more new biotherapies may include a subgroup-speci c risk-bene t tradeo based dose or schedule optimization for each
biotherapy, randomization among regimes restricted to achieve balance within subgroups, and subgroup-speci c group
sequential rules to select superior regimes or drop unsafe or ine ective regimes. The proposed research will construct
robust Bayesian regression models for regime-outcome e ects that account for patient heterogeneity, including possible
regime-subgroup interactions. These will be the basis for sequential decision making and regime assignment, and
they may include latent variables to adaptively combine subgroups with similar regime-outcome e ects. Each clinical
trial design will be tailored to address a combination of these goals in speci c biotherapy settings. For each design,
user-friendly computer software will be provided, including programs for trial simulation to establish design operating
characteristics, trial conduct, and use by practicing physicians to choose optimal regimes for their patients. The
overarching goal of the proposed research is to develop and identify optimal personalized biotherapy regimes, spanning a

Episodic memories integrate the content of human experience in space and time and constitute the core of one's
identity. Memory formation involves processing, and constructing interpretations of the incoming information in
our daily lives and is one of the first functions compromised in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's
Disease. With population aging, we face a “Cognitive Tsunami” of millions of people with memory disorders.
Thus, understanding neural mechanisms of memory, and finding interventions that enhance these processes is
a critical endeavor with the potential to improve the lives of countless people world-wide.
 Although it is established that memory is critical for cognitive well-being, and sleep is critical for memory
consolidation, the underlying mechanisms in the human brain are poorly understood. Research on memory and
sleep so far has suffered from a gap between non-invasive cognitive research in humans and detailed
electrophysiological research in animals. Moreover, most human studies are dominated by stimulus response
methodologies where the presented stimuli constitute limited, discretized, aspects of memory. This approach,
albeit well-controlled, is far from the rich narrative of episodes we experience. Thus, to mechanistically probe
human memory consolidation, it is imperative to (a) employ methodologies that incorporate the continuous and
multimodal nature of experience; (b) identify relevant neural activation patterns and how they are transformed
and reactivated during sleep; (c) establish means to causally modulate memory processes during sleep.
 Building upon our exploratory U01 project, this proposal seeks a breakthrough in our understanding by
going beyond the state-of-the-art, and via the application of integrative and multidisciplinary approaches. It
capitalizes on a highly unique opportunity to record and modulate neuronal activity of a large number of
single neurons and neuronal assemblies in the human brain. In parallel, it exploits the high dimensionality
of the data as an asset through the use of cutting-edge Deep Learning (DL) algorithms, which have emerged
as promising analysis tools. Specifically, the project will investigate the presence, and decoding, of distributed
neural patterns associated with memory for different aspects of experience during wakefulness and identify
their reactivation during sleep. The proposal aims to selectively modulate memory via application of novel
closed-loop stimulation in sleep in concert with the DL model predictions.
 We anticipate that this project is poised to shed light on the relationship between sleep and memory, and
its modulation from a novel perspective. Such an ambitious goal can only be achieved with unrivaled combination
of experience, access to a clinical setting, and interdisciplinary collaborations such as those proposed in this
project. By combining the opportunity to stimulate and record neural activity with the computational power of
artificial intelligence, this project aims to offer findings with far reaching implications for basic neuroscience and
contribute to the development of novel therapies for human memory disorders."
10851800,"Project Summary/Abstract
Approximately 38.5% of Americans >65 years of age report chronic pain lasting 6 months or
longer. This percentage is expected to increase given the growth in the older adult population
and the associated growth of chronic conditions that can contribute to pain. Chronic pain tends
to be more complex in older adults with ~70% of them describing pain in multiple sites and over
60% describing multiple types of pain.
To date, no large national sample of older adults provides detailed, longtitudinal information on
the experience of chronic pain in older adults; the pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic
strategies that older adults are using to manage their chronic pain; and the impact of chronic
pain on important person-centered outcomes. The proposed study will fill these significant gaps
in knowledge by conducting the first national longitudinal study focused on chronic pain in older
adults. In a large national sample of 1888 older adults, of whom 1,232 have chronic pain (i.e.,
pain >6 months duration) and 656 do not have chronic pain, we aim to: 1) Determine the
prevalence and characteristics (i.e. quality, severity, interference) of chronic pain as well as
identify the pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatments used to manage chronic pain; 2)
Evaluate for longitudinal differences in biological, psychological, social factors, as well as
physical and cognitive function and QoL between older adults with and without chronic pain; and
3) Examine the longitudinal relationships between chronic pain (i.e., worst pain score) and
patient reported outcomes (i.e., physical function, cognitive function, QoL). We will determine
which biological, psychological, and social factors at enrollment are associated with changes in
the trajectories of chronic pain, identify subgroups of older adults with distinct pain profiles using
latent profile analysis, and determine how changes in the trajectories of physical function,
cognitive function, and QoL are associated with these distinct pain profile classes.
Informed by a better understanding of pain characteristics, factors associated with chronic pain,
treatment approaches and long-term impact, we will be equipped to develop and test tailored
interventions that target subgroups of older patients, with the goal of improving the management
of chronic pain, as well as overall function and QoL."
10917118,"Project Summary/Abstract
 The overarching goal of this proposal is to understand how the stereotypical structure of retina forms
during embryonic development. Towards this goal, this proposal seeks to develop novel molecular recording
technologies that allow the reconstruction of lineage history based on endpoint measurements. This method
leverages genome editing techniques to stochastically create heritable mutations within synthetic barcode
arrays that accumulate edits over time. Because readout of these arrays is compatible with spatial
transcriptomics technologies, these methods when combined will allow the simultaneous capturing of
transcriptional cell state, lineage relationships, and spatial position of single cells within retina tissue. The
resulting lineage tree datasets will then be analyzed using a novel statistical tool termed Lineage Motif
Analysis, a computational approach to identify all significantly over- or under-represented cellular patterns. This
approach systematically enumerates all possible arrangements of observed fates on progressively larger
subtrees and then compares their frequencies to those expected in a null model based on uncorrelated cell
fate between cell divisions. Lineage trees will reveal how birth-order of cell types is regulated on the clonal
level and lineage motifs will reveal the extent to which lineage in the retina is stochastic or preprogrammed.
Furthermore, lineage motifs represent direct insight into the “rules” that govern how the retina forms during
development, and provide a way to describe how such “rules” change in different contexts like disease or
pharmacological perturbation. The datasets and analysis proposed here will inform the development of new
therapeutic strategies for regenerative medicine to treat retinal diseases that lead to blindness.
 My training program outlined here will equip me with the necessary tools and knowledge to (1) carry out
the aims of this proposal and gain novel biological understanding, and (2) advance me towards my career goal
of leading a research team focused on studying the fundamental principles that underlie embryonic
development and disease progression. I will work with Dr. Long Cai, a pioneer in spatial transcriptomics, to
learn imaging and image processing techniques, as well as Dr. Carlos Lois, an expert in neurobiology, to learn
mouse manipulation and surgical procedures. Dr. Elowitz and I will meet regularly to discuss my research
progress, writing plans for paper publications and grants, teaching/mentoring students, and opportunities to
present my research at Caltech and national conferences. As a PhD student at Caltech, I will have access to
leaders well-versed in applying quantitative approaches to study developmental biology, state-of-the-art core
facilities, and cutting-edge coursework in both biology and statistics. By funding the rest of my PhD research,
this fellowship will enable me to uncover the fundamental principles that underlie retina development and set
me up for independence as I transition towards becoming an independent investigator in my later career."
10907850,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A crucial function of the central nervous system is to bias behavior toward events and outcomes that hold
relevance for survival. It is well recognized that odors have a strong effect on animal behavior, as they guide
food search, maternal bonding, and mate selection. Even though humans do not consider olfaction to be a
dominant sense, humans are similarly swayed by the rewarding properties of odors. With recent developments
in the pattern-based analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data and non-invasive brain
stimulation techniques, we are now in a position to explore the neural mechanisms of olfactory reward in
humans. During the previous funding cycle, we gained key insights into how odor rewards are represented in
orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and how the dopaminergic midbrain may support these representations. The
objective of the current renewal application is to capitalize on these novel methods in order to address new
questions arising from these initial findings about the neural mechanisms of odor-guided behavior in humans.
Specifically, we will use OFC-targeted transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and novel behavioral tasks that
involve food odors as rewards to reveal the specific contribution of different OFC networks to decision making.
Moreover, the proposed studies will combine network-based TMS with pattern-based fMRI to elucidate the
neural mechanisms that drive learning about the identity of future odor rewards. Complementary studies will
examine how one’s motivational state modulates perceptional and neural responses to food odors, such that
they can aid the detection of biologically relevant rewards in the environment. Together the experiments
proposed in this project will fundamentally extend our understanding of olfactory reward processing in the
human brain at the functional and mechanistic level, with implications for neuroscientific research on learning,
memory, and behavior in general. Moreover, the findings from this work can lead to a better understanding of
the behavioral deficits described in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders, including Schizophrenia, eating
disorders, and addiction, and may ultimately provide insights into the development of novel diagnostic and
therapeutic approaches."

Project Summary/Abstract
The Machine Shop remains an essential Core servicing the researchers in Vision Science at UAB. It enables
custom components to be designed and built to accommodate uncommon species (e.g. tree shrew, macaque)
for which commercial equipment is unavailable or unsuitable for the novel science being pursued. The Core
also enables new instruments to be built or commercially incompatible components to be melded for new
purposes. Whenever it is practical to do so, all new device and component designs are now initiated with
digital drawings in AutoCAD, which seamlessly operates with two new major pieces of equipment: a computer-
numerically-controlled (CNC) milling machine and a 3-D printer for high-end materials. Our move to a digital
platform streamlines the manufacturing process by minimizing trial-and-error in new devices and improves
precision and repeatability. The digital approach also helps to educate trainees on the feasibility and
practicality of their designs, as they can learn to visualize the final product without having to make it first. Our
machinist is now experienced with on-going scientific projects by Core users, the wide range of new materials
available (biocompatible alloys and plastics), and he routinely offers design and materials recommendations
that improve and expedite project outcomes. The design process is further facilitated by the machinist’s
recently acquired Associate degree in computer-aided drafting. Currently the Machine Shop Core is used
extensively or moderately by 14 of the 25 Core Grant participants."

10689014,"ABSTRACT
The NOD2:RIPK2 complex helps a cell recognize and respond to an intracellular bacterial infection. Activation
of this pathway initiates a cytokine response that helps tailor the adaptive immune system to eradicate the
offending pathogen. Signaling from this complex must be precisely tailored. Too little inflammation can cause
immunodeficiency that can manifest in dysbiosis while too much inflammation can manifest in inflammatory
disease. Over the past decade, my lab has worked to understand this signaling system with the goal of
identifying drug targets such that when the NOD2:RIPK2 complex is hyperactive and therefore
hyperinflammatory, we have pharmacologic tools to inhibit it. To this end, we have now developed agents for
RIPK2 that inhibit its kinase activity. These inhibitors are now at the Pre-IND stage and we anticipate filing for
an IND in late 2020 or early 2021. Despite this chemical success, key questions surrounding RIPK2’s kinase
activity remain. While some studies suggest that kinase activity is necessary for function, others suggest it is
not. We don’t know the kinase-dependent versus kinase-independent signaling pathways that are activated or
inhibited. We don’t know any bone fide RIPK2 substrates, and we don’t know which patients will particularly
benefit from RIPK2 inhibition. To this end, we have developed phosphoproteomic and phospho-substrate
databases utilizing mass spectrometry and chemical genetics. This grant application aims to leverage these
unpublished databases to i) identify novel RIPK2 substrates, ii) identify novel RIPK2 kinase-regulated signaling
pathways and iii) identify patient populations in which RIPK2 targeting might be most efficacious. Better
understanding RIPK2’s kinase activity is highly significant as RIPK2 inhibitors enter the clinic over the next few
years."
10893991,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
The quantity and quality of aging in place after a hip fracture is poor, and these outcomes have not improved
substantially over the last 20 years. The built environment in an older adult’s neighborhood has a strong
influence on the quality of aging in place 4-6—yet has not been addressed in usual hip fracture care. This is
especially concerning for older adults who live in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods, which have
fewer resources to support high-quality built environment infrastructure. 5 Crumbling sidewalks and curbs in
disadvantaged neighborhoods are associated with a 400% increase in mobility disability for older adults. 7 Older
adults living in disadvantaged neighborhoods are also more likely to perceive their neighborhoods to be
unsafe, and thus less likely to participate in physical activity outside.
 In this Beeson K76 award, Dr. Falvey proposes a novel model of ENgaging community and municipal
seRvICes to promote high-quality aging in place after Hip fracture (ENRICH). ENRICH uniquely combines
successful mobility interventions from prior work on hip fracture recovery, proactively identifying neighborhood-
level barriers to recovery during the transition home after hip fracture, helping obtain needed services and
equipment to bridge gaps related to the built environment, and provide targeted additional rehabilitation that
focuses on community level mobility in a real-world environment after completion of usual care. The goal of
ENRICH is promoting greater mobility in the community and allowing older adults to participate in community
activities to improve the quality of aging in place.
 To tailor ENRICH for Baltimore, this project will 1) gather information on which factors (e.g. housing)
most strongly impact the number of healthy days spent at home after hip fracture, using Medicare claims data
linked with US Census Bureau data; 2 use this data to guide interviews with patient and clinician stakeholders
to elucidate meaningful adaptations of ENRICH; and 3) pilot test the adapted ENRICH intervention with 24
older hip fracture patients living in disadvantaged neighborhoods.
 Completing these aims will help launch Dr. Falvey’s career as an independent clinician-scientist and
leader in the fields of rehabilitation and aging. He proposes to gain complementary skills in longitudinal and
mixed methods data analysis, patient-centered outcomes research, healthcare disparities, and conduct of
clinical trials. His mentorship team, led by Dr. Jay Magaziner, is well-positioned to help him complete the study
successfully and support his career development."
10877877,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) provide durable clinical responses in about 20% of cancer patients, but
have minimal effects in cancers lacking intra–tumoral T cells. Approaches that turn T–cell–deplete cancers into
ones that attract high–quality T cells are needed to sensitize these unresponsive cancers to ICIs. Tumors contain
somatic mutations that encode for mutant proteins that are tumor–specific and not expressed on normal cells
(termed neoantigens). Cancers, such as melanoma, with the highest mutational burdens are more likely to
respond to single agent ICIs. However, most cancers, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC),
have lower mutational loads, resulting in lower antigenicity, weaker endogenous T cell repertoires, and fewer T
cells infiltrating the tumor. PDACs also have an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) consisting
of monocytes, B cells and T cells that express T cell inhibitory signals. Preclinical studies show that a mutated
KRAS (mKRAS) vaccine given with ICIs to genetically–engineered mice overexpressing mKRASG12D (KPC mice)
inhibits premalignant lesions from progressing to PDAC (PMID: 24607504). My work with Panc02 cells showed
that a neoantigen–targeted vaccine, PancVAX, a mixture of twelve 20–mer neoantigen peptides, when paired
with IC modulators cleared tumors in Panc02–bearing mice with a survival benefit (PMID: 30333318). In this
proposal we will test the hypothesis that peptide vaccines targeting ‘shared’ mKRAS neoantigens, or
‘personalized’ patient–tumor–specific neoantigens will trigger high–quality neoantigen–specific effector and
effector memory T cells, which will then become available for further activation by ICIs and result in tumor
rejection. We will thus conduct two early clinical trials to test vaccines targeting mKRAS (Specific Aim 1) or
patient–tumor–specific neoantigens (Specific Aim 2) in combination with the ICIs ipilimumab and nivolumab in
patients with resected and metastatic PDAC, respectively. In both instances, we will assess safety of the triple
combinations, perform in–depth immune phenotyping of peripheral blood to include T cell number, quality and
repertoire, and study the cellular architecture of the TME. A complement of state–of–the–art technologies
including single cell RNA–Seq and TCR–Seq, and multispectral immunofluorescence will be utilized. In the long
term, these studies should inform future combination immunotherapy approaches in PDAC patients, and, in the
short term, will provide me with vital new skillsets in bioinformatics, human immunology, and early clinical trial
design. The outstanding mentorship of my Advisory Team, the rich scientific environment at Johns Hopkins, and
the vast array of available resources should poise me to achieve my goal of becoming a funded, independent
investigator in translational oncology by the end of this grant period."

The Science & Health Education Partnership (SEP) at the University of California, San
Francisco (UCSF) proposes Constructing a Community of Teen Health Science Leaders
(THSL). THSL is designed as a leadership opportunity that offers a roadmap for its teen
participants to recognize themselves as “science leaders.” The teen participants, from
backgrounds underrepresented in the sciences, will work closely with UCSF faculty to
understand the NIH-funded research that informs teen health recommendations. Through these
collaborations, the students will identify health issues that impact their community and plan how
to share this information at a one-day Health Summit for their peers. Design of the Health
Summit (its speakers, session styles, and interactive activities) will be informed by participants’
knowledge of their community and how best to inspire engagement among their peers. The
Health Summit will also give these students the opportunity to be recognized as science leaders
among their peers. We believe that this leadership opportunity will engender a sense of
belonging in science that will encourage the student participants to ultimately pursue STEM
careers. The specific aims for this project are to: 1) Develop a community of Teen Health
Science Leaders; 2) Support Teen Leaders as they organize and lead the annual Teen Health
Summit; 3) In collaboration with learning researchers, develop a validated instrument to
measure “Belonging in Science,” and test the impact of THSL on students’ sense of belonging;
and, 4) Publish the results of the learning research in peer-reviewed journals to inform and
advance the science education community’s understanding of student belonging in science.
In order to study the program’s impact on belonging in science, THSL incorporates two levels of
engagement among the Teen Leaders. Over the life of the project, 80 students will serve as
Junior Leaders, with 15 of these students selected to rejoin the program in subsequent years as
Senior Leaders. The Belonging in Science survey instrument will compare the responses of all
THSL Teen Leaders to the control group of Health Summit student attendees (600 over the life
of the grant). Lessons on healthy behaviors from the Health Summit will be further amplified by
sharing teen-crafted health messaging via social media and by presenting interactive activities
from the Health Summit at the Bay Area Science Festival. Combined over the life of the grant,
we anticipate reaching more than 52,000 additional people with public health messaging
designed and facilitated by teens."
10691581,"Kidney transplantation improves the health and quality of life for those veterans with end stage kidney disease
(ESKD). While early patient and graft survival are excellent, long-term outcomes continue to be challenging.
Patient death with existing kidney graft function occurs in about half of all recipients over time. This is primarily
due to the development of cardiovascular disease in a patient population with multiple preexisting cardiac
disease risk factors. There has been little progress in improving outcomes in this area for over two decades.
Recent studies in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients using SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), regardless of the
presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), results in both kidney protective and cardiac protective impacts
and improved patient outcomes. However, kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) were excluded from these clinical
trials due to concerns that these agents promote infection, diminish graft function, and may alter
immunosuppressive drug levels that are the mainstay of patient’s transplant therapy. There are limited published
data of SGLT2i treatment of selected KTRs. The goal of this submission is to examine the safety and efficacy of
SGLT2i therapy in veterans with KTRs and T2DM. Our hypothesis is treatment with SGLT2i will lead to
improvements in graft and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with T2DM, with acceptable side effect profile.
To test this hypothesis, we will execute a multicenter clinical trial at 4 VA medical centers, including 3 that serve
as primary kidney transplant programs. Our multidisciplinary research team includes transplant medical and
surgical expertise, diabetology, and informatics and statistical support familiar with VA data systems. In open
label fashion, we will treat eligible KTRs and comprehensively assess adverse and serious adverse event data,
as well as assess any untoward impacts on graft function and diabetes management. Secondly, we will utilize
VA data from the VINCI corporate data warehouse to develop a control cohort of veterans with KTRs and T2DM,
not treated with SGLT2i. We will utilize propensity score matching to reduce bias that may occur in observational
studies. With this strategy, we will further address the potential beneficial impact of SGLT2i treatment on
cardiovascular outcomes, as well as kidney disease progression in the transplanted kidney. We will also analyze
the cost impact of using this agent in this patient population, in terms of hospitalizations, unanticipated
procedures, and CKD management. These studies will provide new information to the transplant community for
both veteran and non-veteran alike, with a detailed assessment of safety and feasibility of this agent class using
a pragmatic approach to transplant care. These results will translate into an opportunity to mitigate late graft loss
in this patient population, and a potential breakthrough in clinical care that to date has been unrecognized."

(therapeutics) of high programmatic interest. Preterm infants are at great risk of developing bronchopulmonary
dysplasia (BPD). BPD leads to a significant impact on lifelong respiratory health. BPD is an oxidative stress-
dependent disease that inhibits alveolarization and induces a combination of other pernicious processes that
results in sustained states of inflammation in the lungs of preterm infants. About 15,000 BPD cases are reported
per year in the US. The costs of caring for BPD patients in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) are over
$350,000 each just in the first months of life. Such costs are over twice the amount required for NICU patients
without BPD. In preliminary studies, we show that N-acetyl-lysyltyrosylcysteine amide (KYC), a novel,
bioengineered tripeptide inhibitor of myeloperoxidase (MPO) toxic oxidant production, is an effective agent for
improving lung growth, increasing weight gain, and improving survival in hyperoxic pups by inhibiting multiple
points of a newly defined destructive inflammatory cycle initiated by supplemental oxygen (S-O2) and the tissue
damage caused by S-O2. Accordingly, the goal of this Direct to Phase II proposal is to perform the preclinical
safety, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and preliminary toxicology studies necessary to generate data
required for pre-IND meetings with the FDA for using KYC to treat BPD patients presenting in the NICU. In Aim
1, we will determine the efficacy of IV KYC in hyperoxic rat pups and its pharmacokinetics. Preliminary studies
reveal that KYC has an excellent intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SQ) bioavailability in adult mice. Our
previous published BPD studies utilized KYC given to hyperoxic rat pups by the intraperitoneal (IP) route. Aim
1A will be to determine the efficacy of KYC given by the IV route to hyperoxic rat pups compared to IP
administration. We will examine the pups for translational effects of KYC on inflammation and lung development
to confirm published IP administration findings. In Aim 1B, we will determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of KYC
in rat pups. In Aim 2, we will determine the efficacy of KYC in preterm hyperoxic rabbit kittens. We will determine
the effectiveness of IV administered KYC in the 29-day gestation preterm hyperoxic rabbit kitten model of BPD.
We will study the translational effects on inflammation and lung development as per Aim 1. In Aim 3, we will
perform preclinical toxicology studies of KYC. Repeated-dose general toxicology studies will be carried out in
juvenile rats and beagles. These studies will follow a standard design, with the assessment of clinical signs, body
weight, food consumption, toxicokinetics, clinical pathology (hematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis), and
organ weights. With data from Aims 1-3 in hand, ReNeuroGen will be prepared for both a commercialization
readiness pilot program proposal and pre-IND meetings with the FDA."
10903955,"Abstract
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common sleep disorder associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular
(CV) disease. However, it remains uncertain whether treatment of OSA improves CV outcomes given the lack
of evidence from recent clinical trials. We hypothesize that characterizing repetitive nighttime blood pressure
(BP) surges following sleep apnea events improves risk stratification in OSA and helps identify those who benefit
most from therapy. OSA is a major risk factor for nocturnal hypertension, a well-established prognostic marker
for adverse CV outcomes, including mortality. Therefore, it is plausible that nocturnal hypertension acts as a
mediator between OSA and CV morbidity and mortality. However, continuous BP is not currently quantified in
clinical sleep studies for OSA evaluation, while the conventional ambulatory BP monitoring device that
intermittently measures BP is unable to capture BP surges associated with sleep apnea events. To capture sleep
apnea-specific episodic BP increase, we will use a recently validated finger-cuff-based beat-to-beat BP device
to monitor nocturnal BP during polysomnography (PSG). In this time-sensitive ancillary study, we propose to
examine the extent to which sleep apnea-specific BP increase is associated with an increased risk for CV
outcomes (Aim 1, cross-sectional study); and whether individuals with higher sleep apnea-specific BP surges
respond more favorably to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy in terms of reduction in CV risks
(Aim 2, prospective study). In addition, we will examine the race-specific differences between White and African
American in the degree of sleep apnea-specific BP increase and whether the associations examined in Aims 1
and 2 are modified by race (Aim 3). To achieve these aims, we will leverage the infrastructure and resources of
the ongoing NHLBI sponsored parent study at the Brigham and Women's Hospital (N~160) in which novel PSG-
derived physiological metrics are being investigated to evaluate their utilities for predicting CV responses to 12-
week CPAP therapy in people with OSA. We will add continuous beat-to-beat BP monitoring to PSG recording
performed at the baseline study of the parent study. The primary CV outcome will be left ventricular strain by
speckle tracking echocardiography, which is a sensitive marker for subclinical mechanical left ventricular
dysfunction. Secondary CV outcomes will include other conventional echocardiographic measures of structural
and functional remodeling, electrocardiographic marker of left atrial electrical remodeling and arterial stiffness
by pulse wave velocity. We will also recruit additional African Americans to have sufficient statistical power in
Aim 3. The major innovation of this proposal is the incorporation of the continuously measured nocturnal BP and
other PSG-derived physiological measurements into the clinical decision making. Our study design allows for
race-specific investigation with the goal of better understanding the mechanisms linking OSA to the existing CV
health disparity in African Americans."

through the development of innovative, transformative, early phase trials testing new conceptual
approaches that will enable clinical advances in the prevention of cancer. Our Aims are to 1.
Advance high priorities in cancer prevention, for maximum impact on cancer incidence when these are
advanced into clinical use. These priorities include (i) investigate novel agents and repurposed agents that
target mutations and pathways known to be important in the development of cancer, (ii) novel or
established biomarkers to identify individuals most like to predict benefit from a given approach, (iii) trials
that will result in unifying biological themes across different organ sites, leading to protection against more
than one cancer type, (iv) test innovative dosing and delivery methods, to reduce the symptom and
toxicity burden for users of cancer prevention agents. 2. Provide consultation, scientific guidance, and
mentoring to consortium investigators who are proposing new trial concepts; assist consortium investigators
through trial design, initiation, conduct, and analysis; and to serve as the administrative hub of the
consortium. We will foster communication, collaboration, and sharing of available resources
between consortium members and across consortia, to maximize impact of clinical trials testing similar
interventions or in similar populations. Serve as a liaison between the consortium and the NCI DCP, by

and/or depression than as a lone diagnosis. Up to 90% of individuals with PTSD may
present with comorbid anxiety disorders. We propose to study the underlying genetic
architecture of anxiety disorders and how they overlap, interact with and influence other
co-morbid disorders. We will perform genome-wide association studies in the Million
Veteran Program sample (~200,000 informative individuals and growing), UK Biobank
(~100,000 individuals), and All of Us (~36,000 informative individuals and growing)
using anxiety traits to investigate the genetic architecture of anxiety disorders. We will
perform sex and ancestry stratified as well as joint-analyses to search for sex or
ancestry specific variation. Sex-chromosome-wide association studies will be
conducted in the same samples. The sex chromosomes (and mitochondrial DNA) are
understudied in genetics, with most studies focused on the autosomes. This is despite
evidence for a role for the polyamine system in depression, stress disorders and suicide
and the gene for the rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine catabolism,
“spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase 1” (SAT1) being found the X-chromosome.
It is critical to include the sex-chromosomes for a complete picture of the genetic
architecture of disease. Finally, we will seek to use functional genomics, polygenic risk
scoring, and causal inference to assay the functional importance of lead findings,
genetic overlap and liability to related traits, and potential for clinical translation of
findings."
10908370,"Up to 60% of adults and 80% of children with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) develop
nephritis (LN), with 10–30% progressing to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The gold standard
for diagnosis of LN is a renal biopsy. Histological parameters remain the best predictors of
ESRD. Despite being the gold standard, histological diagnosis of LN has several shortcomings.
In multiple inter-observer renal pathology assessment studies reported thus far, the inter-
pathologist correlation coefficients, or concordance, in assessing most histological parameters
have been sub-optimal. This has provided the impetus for the current proposal.
We propose to leverage the power of computer vision and deep learning to build a classifier that
rivals the best-trained renal pathologists in making a histological diagnosis of LN using current
diagnostic criteria. We propose to train a deep convolutional neural network to distinguish the
different LN classes, and to identify a full spectrum of histological attributes useful for diagnosis.
We will compare the performance of the newly generated neural network in scoring
glomerular/tubulo-interstitial features and LN classes, against a panel of human renal
pathologists. Finally, we propose to build a neural network that can predict clinical outcome
based on baseline renal pathology. Reliable and reproducible classification of LN could
dramatically improve patient management and long-term renal and patient survival."

The goal of this proposal is to provide mechanistic insight into how METH use alters the monoocyte epigenetic
landscape and viral reservoir dynamics to impact clinical progression in treated HIV infection.
There is a strong resurgence of methamphetamine (METH) use that is fueling one-in-three new HIV infections
in MSM [1]. Although the majority of MSM who use METH can achieve viral suppression in the modern anti-
retroviral therapy (ART) era, findings from our team and others indicate that approximately half experience
virologic rebound (i.e., at least one viral load > 200 copies/mL) over 15 months [2]. There is also evidence that
METH and other stimulant use predict faster clinical HIV progression even after adjusting for HIV disease
markers and self-reported ART adherence [3], [4]. Little is known about the bio-behavioral mechanisms whereby
METH use accelerates HIV pathogenesis.
We have demonstrated that host surrogates of monocyte inflammation processes, that are key drivers in viral
immunopathogenicity and neuropathogenicity (including soluble CD14 and CD163 [sCD14, sCD163]), are
exacerbated by recent METH use and amplified among MSM who inject METH in treated HIV infection [5], [6],
[7], [9]. This is further underscored by our recent preliminary data obtained through a METH using HIV cohort
indicating increases in monocyte activation markers (IL-6, sCD14) in METH using HIV subjects relative to HIV
only subjects. We hypothesize that METH use disrupts the monocyte epigenetic landscape to impart long-
lasting changes in immune activation and on lymphoid and myeloid cell reservoir dynamics that drives
HIV pathogenesis in treated HIV infection.
We propose to assess the impact of METH use on the dynamics of the biologically competent reservoir and on
the epigenetic landscape of monocytes. We will access well-defined cohort resources (IDEA, CRUSH) of METH-
using MSM to interrogate the monocyte epigenetic landscape and the viral reservoirs with virologic surrogates
that are tailored to revealing reservoir changes in both lymphoid and myeloid reservoirs in highly vulnerable
subjects where longitudinal sampling is likely to be challenging. Specifically, we propose to:
Aim 1: Assess the monocyte epigenetic landscape and lymphoid viral reservoir dynamics and
surrogates of clinical HIV progression and neuropsychiatric health in MSM who do or do not use METH
on effective ART and who naturally interrupt ART,
Aim 2: Interrogate the plasma virome in MSM on effective ART who do or do not use METH and who
naturally interrupt ART to gauge the impact of METH use on myeloid reservoir activation in vivo.
Advancing our basic understanding of the underlying mechanisms whereby METH alters the monocyte
epigenetic landscape and viral reservoir dynamics will guide the development of approaches to ameliorate the
impact of METH use on clinical progression in treated HIV infection."

 Primary immune deficiencies (PIDs) are a group of over 480 rare disorders of the immune system that
result in increased susceptibility to infections, autoimmunity, and malignancies. The most severe forms of PIDs
are fatal unless immune reconstitution is achieved by hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) or gene
therapy. In 2009, the Primary Immune Deficiency Treatment Consortium (PIDTC) was established to conduct
retrospective and prospective studies of risk factors, long term outcomes and late effects in individuals with
severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS), and chronic granulomatous
disease (CGD); with the 2019 funding cycle a protocol to study primary immune regulatory disorders (PIRD)
was added. Because individual PIDs are rare, multicenter collaborations are needed to systematically collect
detailed data to study outcomes and to develop clinical trials to determine the best interventions.
 Annual Workshops, starting in 2011, and continuously funded by R13 awards from NIAID, have brought
together participating investigators from the PIDTC sites, now comprising 47 academic centers across the US
and Canada. These Workshops and Education Days, the latter added in 2016 to encourage and train a
diverse group of new experts, fosters interaction between physicians, basic scientists, patient advocates, and
engage trainees who then become leaders. This application requests continuation of R13 support for PIDTC
Workshops for the coming 3 years. The proposed 13th PIDTC Scientific Workshop and Education Day in
Cincinnati, Ohio (PIDTC2023) will be themed “New Treatments for Primary Immune Disorders.” We will offer
topics including cellular therapies for infections, graft vs. host disease, gene therapy, and development of
clinical trials. Plans for the two following workshops in 2023 and 2024 are described.
 The specific objectives are:
1. Collect, analyze and disseminate information on survival, clinical status, and immune function in patients
 with PIDs who have received HCT or other forms of treatment.
2. Establish biological markers to predict successful immune reconstitution following treatments.
3. Evaluate novel approaches to treatment for PIDs that minimize HCT-related toxicity while fostering robust
 and durable engraftment and immune reconstitution.
4. Develop optimal treatment protocols for infants with SCID identified by newborn screening.
5. Develop clinical trials to define best practices for treatment of PIDs.
6. Encourage trainees to become the next generation of PID experts.
7. Recruit and train underrepresented minority physicians to the field of PID.
8. Increase synergy between scientists, physicians, and patient advocates from diverse backgrounds to
 improve PID awareness and public education."
10912750,"Abstract:
IgE-mediated food allergy to peanuts (PN) and/or tree nuts (TN), is a major health problem in
the United States, affecting approximately 4% of children and up to 2% of adults. Co-allergy
among these foods is relatively common and is difficult to identify given the more common
finding of co-sensitization. Recent progress with early administration of these foods and oral
immunotherapy, especially in conjunction with anti-IgE have merit. Unfortunately, these
approaches are not successful for all patients and, even when successful, have limitations
regarding compliance and unpredictable breakthrough. There are significant, unmet needs to
1) understand the immunologic details of IgE mediated activation of mast cells by allergens
from PN and TN, 2) understand the molecular basis for co-allergy among TN and between PN
and TN, 3) develop improved diagnostics to identify clinically relevant peanut and tree nut
allergy and 4) design new approaches to interfere with allergic reactions caused by peanuts.
The overarching concept of this proposal is that the 2S albumins are the most important
allergens of peanuts and tree nuts and are the key to understanding PN and TN allergy and
cross-reactivity and to developing potent diagnostic and potentially therapeutic reagents.
Preliminary data show that we have 1) developed a sensitive ELISA assay, 2) identified the
critical amino acids within IgE-binding peptides, 3) demonstrated that conformationally
constrained (3D) peptides bind IgE strongly and 4) shown that patients with PN allergy alone
and PN + TN allergy identify different patterns of peptides in a microarray assay. We
hypothesize that 1) we can optimize IgE binding to existing peptides and discover novel
peptides with enhanced binding, 2) there are cross- reacting epitopes of PN and selected TN
and 3) IgE binding to existing and novel peptides will have potential predictive value for
important clinical outcomes. We propose to 1) perform positional amino acid (aa) screening to
optimize binding of IgE to peptides, 2) utilize click chemistry and stapling technology to
enhance IgE binding and resistance to proteases and 3) use microarray technology to assess
IgE binding with well-defined samples from patients with PN, WN, PecN, CN and PisN allergy
and from those undergoing clinical trials. Success in this project will establish a new
intellectual framework regarding allergen/IgE interactions, describe, at least in part, the
molecular basis for these co-allergies, design new diagnostics and move us along the path
toward development of an oral, peptide based, treatment for peanut allergy."
10925286,"Abstract: In early breast carcinogenesis, neoplastic cells grow in multiple layers towards the lumens of ducts,
which subjects the periluminal cells to harsh conditions of low oxygen, low pH, and nutrient deprivation.
Adaptation to these harsh conditions is a pre-requisite for survival of incipient tumor cells. Adaptations are initially
acute and reversible, but eventually Darwinian selection results in cells with hardwired phenotypes. A prominent
example of this is aerobic glycolysis, or the Warburg Effect (WE), wherein cells are hard-wired to ferment
glucose, even in the presence of oxygen. Notably, a WE is highly correlated with a cancer’s metastatic potential
and poor outcome. Hence, a major question in carcinogenesis is: “What are the mechanisms by which a harsh
microenvironment eventually selects for hard-wired (heritable) phenotypes, such as a WE?”. Rather than simply
selection of pre-existing phenotypes, we contend that the microenvironment actively induces phenotypic diversity
through a systematic set of epigenetic and genetic alterations.
 To address this question, we combine preliminary data from three different approaches that are all focused
on the eco-evolutionary dynamics occurring during carcinogenesis: In the first, we have subjected benign breast
cancer and epithelial cells to harsh conditions encountered in DCIS and have observed that the cells that survive
these selections exhibit a WE. We selected three clones and applied single cell RNA sequencing and single cell
ATAQ sequencing as well as whole exome sequencing to map the transcriptome, epigenome, and mutation
patterns of the selected clones compared to their parental normal cells. This will form the model system to be
analyzed throughout the current proposal. In the second line of investigation, we have documented the profound
epigenetic changes that occur during progression of multiple myeloma (MM) from pre-malignant to metabolically
active disease. We hypothesize that these observations in MM can provide a framework to predict and interpret
the changes that breast cancer cells undergo as they transition from a benign non-glycolytic to an aggressive
glycolytic state. In the third line of investigation, we have outlined a continuum starting with epigenetic changes
and show how these result in permanent mutational or chromosomal changes. This latter work provides a
framework with which to predict and interpret how microenvironment-induced epigenetic changes can eventually
lead to hardwired genetic changes that are observed in aggressive glycolytic breast cancer. By combining these
approaches, we propose to decipher the mechanisms whereby microenvironmental stress-induced genome
evolution results in hard-wired phenotypic adaptations, represented by a WE.
 At the end this study, we expect to have a more complete and comprehensive understanding of the
environmentally-induced epigenetic and genetic changes that occur during carcinogenesis, and how these relate
to hard-wired phenotypic profiles, as exemplified by the Warburg Effect."

The mission of the Proteomics Shared Resource is to provide cost-effective, state-of the-art analytical proteomics 
services to investigators of the Cancer Center. During the past funding period, the Core was upgraded as a result 
of a major initiative by SBP, which provided more than $2.5M in support for the purchase of new equipment. This 
upgraded equipment included two Thermo Fusion Lumos systems, Q-Exactive Plus and TSQ Quantiva systems, 
all with appropriate coupled LC systems. Additionally, there was addition of a Bravo AssayMap automation 
system for sample preparation, and the recruitment of highly trained proteomics scientists—the Core staff now 
includes three Ph.D.-level scientists. The Proteomics Core provides a full array of services, including study 
design, sample preparation, and the generation, analysis, and interpretation of data. In addition to straightforward 
protein identification, the Core supports work involving cutting-edge proteomics methodologies, including labeled 
and label-free quantitative proteomics, and both focused and global post-translational modification (PTM) 
analyses. In the past several years, the Core has additionally taken on larger scale high throughput projects. 
The Core also supports affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry (APMS) using proximity labeling and 
epitope tagging technologies to study protein–protein interactions. More recently, the Core has worked closely 
with Cancer Center laboratories to implement new proteomics technologies, including histone PTM profiling, 
biomarker discovery in biofluids, and drug target identification. Over the past funding period, the Proteomics 
Core has provided services to 41 Center members representing all three programs, and this work has supported 
at least 43 cancer-relevant publications."
10888326,"Project Summary:
There is strong evidence for a vascular component in the development and progression of
primary open angle glaucoma (POAG). Specifically, glaucoma is associated with impaired
retinal blood flow (RBF) and autoregulation of RBF. Autoregulatory impairment may precede
retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss and has been proposed as a potentially early, reversible
biomarker. The rationale underlying this proposal is that highly precise and accurate, direct
measures of RBF are necessary to study dynamic changes in RBF and their effect on RGCs.
Current methods of quantifying RBF remain limited as the majority of imaging modalities provide
indirect, relative measurements of RBF. We will directly measure RBF using two robust direct
measures: erythrocyte mediated angiography flowmetry (EMAf) and multimodal adaptive optics
(mAO). Both techniques allow for the highly accurate and precise measurement of RBF down to
the capillary level in the human eye in vivo. We hypothesize that these direct measures of
determining absolute RBF will show impaired autoregulation of microvascular RBF in early
glaucoma and that this will correlate with glaucomatous damage. Our research program will test
this hypothesis through two specific aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will determine the extent of
impaired autoregulation associated with early glaucoma and measure its ability to predict further
glaucoma damage. In Specific Aim 2 we will determine the relationship of capillary density and
RGC density in glaucoma subjects and controls. We predict that early glaucoma subjects will
exhibit significant measurable impaired vascular autoregulation as compared to controls and
that local changes in these parameters will predict structural glaucomatous deficits."

 Similar to other complications of diabetes mellitus (DM), diabetic gastroenteropathy (DGE) reflects organ-
specific dysfunctions likely due to DM-related endocrine, metabolic and immune/inflammatory disturbances.
Therapies for DGE are ineffective and address the symptoms, not the disease itself. Hence, and aligned with
the mission of RFA-DK-20-030, this proposal seeks to uncover the cellular and molecular mechanisms of DGp
and its relative, non-ulcer dyspepsia, in carefully phenotyped patients. We focus on the links between
dysimmunity, ICC, glycemia, and mitochondrial dysfunction.
 The specific aims are as follows: Aim 1. To analyze the relationship between the transcriptome and
epigenome of single gastric immune cells, gastric emptying (GE), and glycemia in DM and non-DM patients
with upper GI symptoms. Aim 2. To determine the relationship between the transcriptome and epigenome of
single circulating PBMCs and single gastric immune cells in DM and non-DM patients with upper GI symptoms.
Aim 3. To investigate the relationship between the transcriptome and epigenome of single gastric ICC and
immune cells and single circulating PBMCs in DM and non-DM patients with upper GI symptoms.
 These studies will be investigated with in vivo (i.e., assessment of the DM phenotype, gastrointestinal
symptoms, and GE) followed by ex vivo assessments (i.e., transcriptome and epigenome of single circulating
PBMCs, single gastric CD45+ cells, and single ICC) in 45 patients undergoing sleeve gastrectomy (i.e., 15
patients in each of 3 groups: non-DM + normal GE, DM + normal GE, DM + delayed GE). This proposal is
anchored by, and builds on, an established bench-to-bedside collaboration between Drs. Bharucha and Ordog
which, through their complementary expertise, has enhanced our understanding of diabetic gastroparesis. It
seeks to better understand the pathogenesis, and through the studies in peripheral immune cells also identify
novel biomarkers, of DGE."
10906110,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Though a number of studies have been reported regarding how aging-associated mutations lead to the
higher incidence of cancer development and more aggressive cancer progression in elderly patients, few studies,
if any, address that how altered mechanical characteristics of the microenvironment in aging tissues affect the
course of cancer pathology. Mounting evidence strongly supports that mechanical properties of the tissues,
including elastic modulus and relaxation time, significantly contribute to the pace of tumor progression. The
reported results so far agree with the notion that the mechanical properties of aging tissues and cells are different
from those of young tissues and cells. Given that tissues are, in general, stiffer in older individuals and tissue
stiffness is known to promote tumor progression, we hypothesize that aging skin tissue, exhibiting distinct
mechanical characteristics, promotes the progression of skin cancer in elderly patients via p53-mediated
pathways. To prove this hypothesis, first, we plan to overcome the knowledge gap in the systematic quantification
of the different mechanical properties between young and aging tissues. We will measure the elastic modulus
and relaxation time of human skin tissues of different ages using a custom-built indentation-based mechanical
analyzer. Second, to systematically investigate how the altered mechanical property promotes tumor
progression, we will establish an in vitro model system in the mimicry of young and aging tissues. Third, we will
use the in vitro model system to evaluate the rate of tumor progression, p53 abundance, stability and activity in
skin cells growing in the varied mechanical/viscoelastic microenvironment."
10912723,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Many adult organs--for instance, intestine, mammary gland, skeletal muscle, skin—respond to reduced
levels of functional demand by shrinking their physical size. In these organs, cells are lost faster than they are
made, leading to a reduction in total cell number. The intestine is a broadly conserved exemplar of demand-
driven organ shrinkage. In wild animals, cyclic periods of starvation cause intestinal size to shrink by 60-75%.
Humans also undergo healthy intestinal shrinkage, but excessive or dysregulated cell loss can quickly become
pathological, as seen in enteropathies like celiac sprue, endotoxemia, and giardiasis. Yet—unlike the
mechanisms that balance cell division/loss during everyday turnover—the mechanisms that tune cell
imbalance for physiological shrinkage are virtually unknown.
 The roadblock to mechanistic investigation of intestinal shrinkage has been the lack of a tractable
laboratory model, which must allow cells (and their dynamic behaviors) to be monitored across time and must
possess cell-specific markers and other tools to facilitate mechanistic studies. Historically, studies used
rodents, but modern research protocols cannot replicate natural famine/feast cycles.
 My lab has developed a new invertebrate model of intestinal shrinkage that is both tractable and
genetically manipulable: the Drosophila adult midgut, akin to the vertebrate small intestine. We demonstrate
that intestinal shrinkage is conserved in Drosophila, and we document that its underlying basis is the massive
squeezing-out of now-superfluous enterocytes through active extrusion.
 Here, we investigate intestinal shrinkage from both sides of the equation for net cellular balance: mature
cell loss (Aim 1) and stem cell capacity (Aim 2). Our studies leverage the midgut’s superlative toolkit of cell-
specific genetic reporters and our own pioneering innovations for real-time and longitudinal imaging of
functioning midguts inside live animals. In Aim 1, we ask how the gut senses loss of ingested food—
mechanical compression, lack of nutrients, or both. We test if two known regulators of extrusion, the
transcriptional co-activator YAP/Yorkie and intercellular Ca2+ waves, function during shrinking to increase
extrusions. Third, we probe whether a shrinking gut regulates cell extrusions at the organ scale or at the level
of individual cells. In Aim 2, we seek the mechanisms that cause a 75% culling of the stem cell pool during
shrinkage—even as stem cell mitoses paradoxically increase. We will test if stem cells initiate non-self-
renewing divisions, adopt terminal fates directly, and/or activate apoptosis.
 The fly gut’s digestive physiology, stem cell lineages, and molecular regulation are similar to humans.
Hence by elucidating the cell-to-organ scale mechanisms that operate at this frontier of tissue biology, this
project may yield leads for therapies to treat cellular imbalances in human disease."

10913379,"Project Summary - Project 1
Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) such as anti-PD-1 antibodies have revolutionized anti-tumor therapy for many
types of cancers including metastatic melanoma. However, the patient response rates are low. Combined
therapies such as ipilimumab and nivolumab produce a higher response rate but are associated with significant
toxicities. A major unmet need is to develop quantitative assays that stratify patients who will respond to anti-
PD-1 therapy to avoid unnecessary toxicities, and direct non-responders to alternative treatments. Such a pre-
treatment or early on-treatment predictor would provide decision-enabling information to clinicians to optimize
the treatment of melanoma patients. While there is enormous interest and intensive efforts from both academia
and industry to identify predictors to response to ICI, the current biomarkers are suboptimal and early on-
treatment biomarkers are not available for any cancer types. Exosomes are nano-sized vesicles secreted by
cells to the extracellular milieu. We found that metastatic melanoma cells secrete exosomes enriched with PD-
L1, which suppress the function of CD8+ T cells in circulation and facilitate tumor growth. In patients’ plasma, the
level of circulating exosomal PD-L1 (“exPD-L1”) and its change during the course of anti-PD-1 treatment are
associated with the patient response to anti-PD-1 therapy (Chen et al., Nature 2018). Most recently, we found
that tumor associated macrophages (TAM) also secrete exosomes that carry PD-L1 (“TAM-exPD-L1”), which
can be selectively and quantitatively measured in patient blood. TAM exosomes effectively suppress the
proliferation and function of CD8 T cells. The overarching goals of Project 1 are to develop a quantitative liquid
biopsy-based tool that enables clinicians to predict the patient response to ICI-based therapies, and to
understand the role of TAM-derived exosomes in immune suppression. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that
exPD-L1, and especially TAM-exPD-L1, individually or in combination, are effective predictors of patient
response to ICI. We perform the assays using a large multi-institutional validation set of patient samples across
different major therapeutic contexts, taking advantage of the unique infrastructure SPORE offers. In Aim 2, we
will systematically investigate the pivotal roles of TAM-derived exosomes in immune suppression using
melanoma-macrophage co-culture system, humanized mouse system, and exosomes purified directly from
patient tumor tissues. Together, our work will establish exosomal PD-L1 as a rationale-based clinically relevant
stratifier that warrants future development for clinical diagnostics. The proposed study will also unveil a role of
TAM exosomes in immune suppression, which will not only advance our understanding of immune suppression
at new dimensions, but also helps develop novel therapeutic approaches to improve the treatment of patients
with melanoma."

The overall goal of this project is to investigate the role of Zika virus (ZIKV) in glaucoma pathobiology. ZIKV is
an emerging viral pathogen that causes microcephaly and leads to severe ocular complications in newborns
born to ZIKV infected mothers. Although the ocular manifestations of ZIKV are primarily reported to affect the
posterior segment of the eye resulting in chorioretinal atrophy, withering of the retina and choroid, and optic
nerve abnormalities, several clinical case reports showed the involvement of the anterior segment resulting in
glaucoma. Studies from our laboratory, as well as those of others, have shown that ZIKV can cause
glaucomatous pathology including an increase in intraocular pressure (IOP), retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss,
and optic nerve damage. The offspring of ZIKV infected dams have shown increased IOP and RGC loss and
the presence of anti-flavivirus-antibody in these mice correlates with significantly enhanced glaucoma
pathology due to antibody-dependent enhancement. Until the recent ZIKV epidemics, glaucoma has been
primarily considered as a genetic and age-related disease and has not been reported among infants exposed
to infection during gestation. Several studies have now reported that ZIKV can cause congenital glaucoma in
infants born from mothers who were infected during pregnancy. Considering the fact that there is an endemic
transmission of ZIKV in >84 countries, it is imperative to investigate the link between ZIKV and glaucoma to
develop new prognostic and therapeutic tools to combat this global health threat. Our laboratory has developed
several in vitro and in vivo models to study the pathobiology of ocular ZIKV infections. In our recent study, we
reported that ZIKV can infect and replicate in human primary Trabecular Meshwork cells (HTMC). More
recently, we performed RNAseq analysis and discovered that ZIKV infection of HTMC leads to transcriptomic
alteration and dysregulation of several pathways including those that modulate ER stress response,
autophagy, hypoxia, and ECM organization. Furthermore, ZIKV-infected mice exhibited increased IOP, ER
stress, and autophagy in the anterior segment of the eye. ZIKV infection also caused RGC death and loss of
RGC and optic nerve damage leading to disruption of anterograde axonal transport. Based on these novel
findings, we hypothesize that ZIKV induces ER stress and autophagy resulting in TM death and dysfunction,
increased IOP, and the development of glaucoma. Two specific aims are proposed to test this hypothesis. Aim
1 will determine the role of ZIKV induced ER stress in TM dysfunction and the pathobiology of glaucoma using
C57BL/6 (WT) and IFNAR1-/- mice/pups and whether the reduction of ER stress alleviates ZIKV induced
glaucomatous pathology. Aim 2 will investigate the role of autophagy using HTMC, and mouse models and
evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of an FDA approved drug, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in ZIKV induced
glaucoma. The anticipated results will establish the role of ZIKV infection in the pathogenesis of glaucoma and
elucidate the molecular mechanisms and pathway-mediated therapeutic targets for future treatments."

21st century changes in the healthcare sector have outpaced changes in science education. High school
students who have the luxury of receiving high quality experiential education are least likely to be from racially,
ethnically, or geographically diverse backgrounds. There is an urgent need to reach students least likely to be
served with culturally responsive, localized science education partnerships, specifically minority and rural
student populations. Without special programming, inequities in educational access will persist, and the
healthcare sector will be ill-prepared for whom it is designed to serve. For the last five years, we have used an
NIH Science Education Partnership Award (SEPA) to address this problem by focusing on teachers as agents
of change. Our prior SEPA (2015-2020), Teachers and Students for Community-Oriented Research and
Education (TSCORE), empowered teachers to engage urban high school students in Kansas through
innovative teaching about health disparities and creation of model units. We found that teachers in
underserved districts lacked the professional development, curricular materials and often depth of knowledge
needed to implement culturally relevant, rigorous NGSS-aligned science curricula. Underserved school districts
are less likely to partner with universities and industry to provide students with opportunities for experiential
learning outside the classroom. And partnerships with industry are key to designing and implementing STEM
educational experiences that meet the needs of a diverse population of students while preparing them for
careers. With these premises in mind, we propose a continuum of educational interventions that are embedded
within the existing structure of the state of Kansas Health and Bio Sciences Career Pathway. “TSCORE LIFT,”
which Links Industry, Faculty, and Teachers in communities, will 1) Create community linkages among health
system, university faculty, and public school teachers to offer a continuum of NGSS-aligned educational
interventions across the state of Kansas Health and Bio Sciences Career Pathway. Each of five Kansas towns
will have a local health system partner, a local K-INBRE university partner, and a public high school, who will
work together to develop NGSS-aligned high school storylines for biology courses; a health science academy

science and healthcare workforce needs. 2) We will empower teachers to work alongside health system and
university partners to develop and implement a curricular continuum of NGSS-aligned localized science
education programming through summer professional development that will mirror the rollout of the science

10919210,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Worldwide, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents the fifth most common cancer and the second-leading
cause of cancer-related mortality. In the U.S., both the HCC incidence and mortality are increasing at an alarming
pace. Despite these concerning trends, treatment options for HCC remain limited, and the prognosis is grim, with
a 5-year survival rate of just 15%. Thus, identifying effective strategies to prevent the development of incident
HCC represents a critical public health need. A growing body of preclinical and population-based observational
data now demonstrate that lipophilic statins, and in particular atorvastatin, reduces hepatic inflammation, cellular
proliferation and cancer cell invasion, and reduces the incidence of HCC, in part by acting on relevant pathways,
including the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway. However, despite these promising data, well-designed randomized
controlled trials (RCTs) of atorvastatin for HCC prevention have not yet been reported. Historically, the feasibility
of an HCC prevention trial has been limited by large sample size and long lengths of follow-up required to assess
target endpoints. Recently, however, our group has derived and validated a 186-gene expression Prognostic
Liver Signature (PLS), that represents an accurate, reproducible and highly reliable surrogate biomarker for HCC
risk in multiple international cohorts of all major viral and non-viral etiologies of cirrhosis. Further, we have
demonstrated that therapeutic modulation of the PLS accurately recapitulates future risk of developing incident
HCC tumors, both in vivo and in confirmatory human studies. Finally, we and others have demonstrated in human
liver tissue samples that atorvastatin modulates the PLS in part by acting on the Hippo-YAP pathway. Thus, the
PLS represents a novel and highly tractable surrogate biomarker endpoint for an RCT of atorvastatin for the
reduction of incident HCC risk.
In this proposal, we will conduct a phase II RCT in 60 patients with compensated cirrhosis, designed to test the
efficacy, safety and tolerability of 48 weeks of atorvastatin for the reduction of HCC risk, defined by our validated
PLS profile. All subjects will have a high-risk PLS defined at screening liver biopsy, and subjects will be randomly
assigned to 1 of 2 study arms for the 48-week study period: atorvastatin 20mg/day or placebo, with appropriate
monitoring for the 48-week period, followed by a repeat biopsy at week 48 to assess for improvement in the PLS
profile. We will also confirm whether atorvastatin has adequately engaged its targets by evaluating
pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, pre/neoplastic markers, and alteration in the Hippo-YAP pathway. We
hypothesize that PLS-based HCC risk level decreases in the atorvastatin arm at the end of 48-week treatment.
If atorvastatin treatment is effective, safe and well-tolerated, it could become the first chemopreventive agent
designed to prevent the development of HCC, guided by PLS, in the growing population of patients in the U.S.
who are affected by cirrhosis and are at high risk for this devastating complication."

TR&D 2: An innovative label-free dual-nanopore TOF sensor for detection and identification of single molecules
Abstract
Nanofluidic devices offer promising and highly innovative approaches for analyzing single molecules and
obtaining biophysical information that cannot be realized using microfluidics due to scaling issues. The ability to
provide reliable, rapid, quantitative, and low-cost identification of single molecules will offer exciting new
opportunities for a broad range of biomedical applications. The goal of TR&D 2 of the Biotechnology Resource
Center of BioModular Multi-scale Systems (CBM2) for Precision Medicine is to produce an innovative label-free
nanofluidic sensor for not only detecting single molecules, but identifying them as well. The hypothesis behind
our nanosensor is, “individual molecules moving electrokinetically through a 2D nanotube will experience time-
of-flight (TOF) that are dependent upon their molecular identity.” We have demonstrated this concept in our
active P41 with baseline separations of fluorescently labeled deoxynucleotide, ribonucleotide monophosphates
and oligonucleotides via their time-of-flight (TOF) through a polymer-based nano-column. TR&D 2 aims to extend
the TOF differentiation of single molecules to a label-free approach. Label-free readout of the molecular-
dependent TOF is achieved using dual-nanopore TOF sensors, where two or more in-plane nanopores are
placed at either end of a nano-column, which is used for nanoscale electrophoresis. The molecular TOF
measured by the time delay between two consecutive current transient signals provides a signature to allow for
identification of single molecules. In the active P41 Center, preliminary data have demonstrated this capability.
This TR&D will develop the hardware and software required for high throughput label-free TOF sensing. High
rate manufacturing of the nanosensor with sub-5 nm in-plane nanopores will be achieved via NIL using the
manufacturing protocols that we developed in our active P41. This will be combined with the development of
data processing electronics and single-molecule identification algorithms based on machine learning to increase
identification accuracies. Technologies required to build multiple nanosensors on a single chip (>100 sensors
per chip) will be developed, which include large area molding tools, replication processes, reliable
electrical/fluidic connections, and electronics/software. This will allow for high throughput processing of single
molecules. As a demonstration of the technology developed in this TR&D, we will use the dual-nanopore TOF
sensor to assess epigenetic modifications of DNA. By integrating solid-state nano-reactors (TR&D 1) with
optimized dimensions of the in-plane nanopores and nano-columns, this sensor can be configured to provide
molecular information from unamplified targets (DNA, RNA, and proteins) with unprecedented identification
accuracies (>95%). This will transform single-molecule processing to allow servicing a broad biomedical
community for a wide range of applications."

TR&D 3: Manufacture and Assembly of Thermoplastic, Modular, Integrated Fluidic Systems
Abstract/Summary
One of the primary limitations in the application of liquid biopsy markers to a diverse set of clinical problems,
such as cancer, stroke, and drug-resistant bacterial infections, is the mass-limits they impose on the
associated molecular assays. Mass limits are particularly problematic when using benchtop instruments and
the associated sample handling. Most liquid biopsy-based molecular assays require multiple steps, each
with a complex workflow, and the added problem of transferring small quantities of targets, such as DNA,
RNA, or proteins, from one instrument to the next. Mixed-scale fluidic systems offer the potential to compress
the entire set of assays into a single, integrated platform reducing sample loss, operator expertise, and
simpler workflows. The goal of CBM2 is to develop technologies to make modular, integrated systems available
for routine clinical use, even for mass-limited samples. Technologies evolving from this project will reduce
the complexity of building and operating integrated and modular fluidic systems specifically designed to
analyze liquid biopsy markers.
In order to reduce the complexity of building such systems, the platforms should be conducive to high-scale
production, which points to the use of injection molded thermoplastics. The modular concept facilitates this
by using the same or similar modules for different assays, ability to use the modules as standalone units,
and a motherboard containing standardized interconnects to host the modules. The focus of TR&D 3 is to
develop technologies for manufacturing and assembly of injection molded motherboards and modules.
High thermal expansion metals will enable robust mixed-scale mold inserts and reduce demolding stresses. A
novel, scalable, repeatable and rapid method of thermally bonding cover plates to polymer substrates
containing fluid networks (pressure assisted, boiling point thermal fusion bonding (PABP TFB)) will be used
that delivers high process yield rates. Another challenge for building modular systems is to ensure that the
small quantities of target DNA, RNA, or proteins can pass reliably between modules and the motherboard
without loss and eliminating the need for O-rings or gaskets. To eliminate the need for gaskets, the
modular systems will use gasketless superhydrophobic fluid interconnects that combine precision
alignment of components to set gaps <10 µm, with superhydrophobic films on the surfaces around a fluid
passage. The seal is a function of capillary forces, has a predictable failure pressure, and can transport
biofluids, such as plasma and blood, and reagents from module to motherboard. The gasketless interconnect
is tolerant of misalignment, which occurs in normal manufacturing processes; efforts in the renewal application
will establish what the range is and the maximum failure pressure.
To demonstrate the power of the modular fluidic systems, TR&D 3 will manufacture and assemble a
complete modular system that will enrich circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and sequence certain genes in their
genome. The system will have five modules connected to a universal motherboard and process a blood sample
to an electronic readout of selected genes of the CTCs, providing actionable information for clinicians."
10929433,"SUMMARY
The major objective of the proposed research is to illuminate the molecular basis underlying genetic and
epigenetic variation in a major developmental gene regulatory network (GRN). Studies from this and other labs
have identified a cascade of “core” zygotically expressed GATA-type transcription factors, and maternal
regulatory inputs, that activate the GRN controlling development of the endoderm in C. elegans. The latter
include the maternally supplied SKN-1/Nrf2 transcription factor and a triply redundant Wnt, MAPK, and src
signaling system that acts through the LIT-1/NLK kinase and the POP-1/Tcf/Lef transcription factor to initiate
endoderm development. Removal of any one of these inputs results in an impenetrant phenotype, reflecting a
bistable state that shows wide variation between genetically distinct isotypes. Analysis of reciprocal crosses
between isotypes with quantitatively different requirements for SKN-1 in this process revealed that endoderm
GRN output is also influenced by long-term heritable epigenetic states that differ between natural C. elegans
isotypes. This transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (TEI) requires genes involved in piRNA function, the
nuclear RNAi pathway, and histone H3K9 methylation. These findings provide a springboard for unveiling the
molecular basis for genetic and epigenetic plasticity in the regulation of the endoderm GRN. In Aim 1, we will
evaluate hypotheses regarding the mechanisms of action of three genes that differentially alter the requirements
for SKN-1 and Wnt signaling. We will assess how expression of the core regulators of endoderm development
is influenced by quantitative variation in the requirement for the maternal GRN inputs. We will assess how
variation in the requirement for LIT-1 kinase is accommodated in the mechanism that controls asymmetric cell
division leading to activation of the endoderm GRN and will test the hypothesis that quantitative variation in the
requirement for LIT-1 extends to its global action in many asymmetric cell divisions. In Aim 2, we will develop
and implement high-resolution, high-throughput approaches to identifying causal genes underlying variation in
the requirement for the major endoderm regulatory inputs. We will test candidate genes for modulation of the
SKN-1-dependent activation of the endoderm GRN. In Aim 3, we will analyze the molecular basis for
transgenerational inheritance (TEI) of GRN output. We will assess the stages in the endoderm GRN that are
modulated by this TEI and test the hypothesis that epigenetic differences in SKN-1 requirement between
selected isotypes extends to other regulatory inputs. We will test the hypothesis that TEI results from differences
in chromatin states of endoderm genes and that differential expression of non-coding RNAs and endoderm
regulatory genes is associated with TEI. Findings from this research will help to illuminate mechanisms of birth
defects and can provide a paradigm for understanding relationships between an individual’s genotype and
responsiveness to pharmacological agents, of importance to advancing precision medicine. They will also reveal
factors that alter the outcome of Wnt signaling, a major regulatory mechanism associated with many cancers."

The last step in cell division, abscission, relies on a transient structure called the midbody, which resides inside
the intercellular bridge between newly forming daughter cells. It consists of overlapping spindle midzone
microtubules which are coated with electron dense material called the midbody matrix. Long conceptualized as
a structural remnant subject to degradation following cytokinesis, emerging data suggest that midbodies play
instructive post-mitotic roles in establishing cell fate, proliferation state, tissue polarity, cilia formation, neuron
function, and oncogenesis. However, very little is known about the functional significance of the electron dense
material, since it was first actively pursued by Michael Mullins and Dick McIntosh in the 1970s, and then by
Ryoko Kuriyama in the 1980s. My lab has uncovered a surprising novel function for this electron dense material
in that it is a site of RNA storage and is a novel actively translating RNP granule with a uniquely complex life
cycle comprised of both membrane-less and membrane-bound phases, that we are calling the MB-granule (for
Midbody-granule). Employing quantitative, super-resolution approaches in live and fixed cells, coupled with
genomics and genetic manipulations to address our questions, we discovered that translation occurs in a
compartment surrounding the midbody RNP granule, as well as in post-mitotic midbody remnants (or MBRs),
and internalized MBRs (or MBsomes). RNA-seq data of isolated mammalian midbodies revealed an enrichment
of both oncogenic and stem cell transcription factors that have no described function in cell division, but
presumably act post-mitotically. Midbody-enriched transcripts initiate translation immediately before abscission,
a step that we have shown occurs in early G1, just after the nuclear envelope is fully reassembled. Treatments
commonly used to determine RNP phase condensates revealed that the midbody matrix behaves as a novel
type of RNP granule, and that the critical cytokinesis kinesin motor, Kif23/MKLP1, may serve as a novel RNP
scaffold. The MB-granule is a very novel class of RNP granule in that it’s translationally active, has membrane-
less and membrane-bound phases, and functions post-mitotically in cell fate and proliferative decisions. Here,
we will focus our efforts to determine the cell-type specific components of MBRs, the spatiotemporal regulation
of MBsome structure, and function, and if MB-granule RNAs are being liberated in cells that engulf them. Our
proposed studies will uncover unique insights into conserved and divergent MBsome structure and function,
offering insight into how this unique RNP condensate and organelle behaves as novel form of intercellular
communication."

This proposal aims to train a dual-degree, DVM-PhD student for a career as a lab animal veterinarian and independent
scientist. The research outlined in this proposal will develop a pre-clinical platform to evaluate CAR-T therapy in a canine
model. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells have induced up to 90% remission rates for treatment
relapsed/refractory B cell malignancies. While mice have been instrumental to CAR-T progress, CAR-T therapy for solid
tumors have been hampered by this inbred, immunodeficient model. Pet dogs are a higher fidelity translational model
due to their outbred genetics, intact immune system, high incidence of cancer, and similar cancer biology.
A CAR is a fusion protein comprised of a T cell receptor signaling domain, costimulatory domain, and an antibody based
binding domain. CARs are introduced to patients’ T cells ex vivo, enabling the T cells to directly recognize tumor antigen.
CAR-T cells are a “living therapy” wherein the efficacy of the treatment relies not only on the design of the CAR, but also
how the CAR-T cells are able to home to the tumor and elicit anti-tumor effects. The CAR helps T cells to “recognize” the
tumor, but the trafficking, persistence, and effector function of these cells relies heavily on intrinsic T cell biology. To
adequately assess CAR-T cell function in vivo, design of the CAR (Aim 1) and patient T cell biology (Aim 2) will be
evaluated.
Aim 1 – Determine optimal CAR design for targeting tumor associated antigens GD2, FolR1, and CD20. CAR constructs
will be designed for the tumor associated antigens GD2, FolR1, and CD20. These CARs will be introduced to primary
canine T cells via a lentiviral vector. The CAR-T cells will be evaluated for efficacy against antigen positive tumors by IFNγ
ELISA, IL-2 ELISA, and Incucyte live cell videomicroscopy. Each of these constructs will be tested with CAR costimulatory
domains 4-1BB and CD28. The CAR constructs with the strongest reactivity will be further evaluated with an NOD scid
gamma (NSG) mouse xenograft model, measuring tumor growth inhibition and CAR-T expansion in vivo.
Aim 2 – Determine which subset of CAR-T cells preferentially traffic and persist in the tumor in vivo. To evaluate the
respective contribution of CAR-T cell subsets to anti-tumor efficacy in vivo, semi-random nucleotide barcodes will be
added to the CAR constructs allowing for the tracking of clonal lineage during CAR-T production, infusion, and post-
engraftment in mice. Using single cell sequencing, clonal diversity of the CAR-T infusion product will be compared to
clonal diversity intratumorally. Subsets of CAR-T that preferentially home to and expand in the tumor will be identified.
Together, these aims will set the basis for future studies of CAR-T therapy in a canine model. Aim 1 will provide a
candidate CAR construct to be evaluated in a canine model. Aim 2 will provide a method for understanding how CAR-T
cells traffic to and persist within a tumor in vivo. This platform will be used to screen and refine novel approaches to
CAR-T therapy in a high-fidelity, high-throughput animal model."

Behavioral studies have shown that early life experience significantly shapes the development of brain abilities.
Accordingly, if early experiences are highly unbalanced, e.g. if they occur under the influence of chronic
challenges or stresses, the individual's personality will develop specific traits, including some that are
associated with severe psychopathologies. Despite these extensive behavioral characterizations, very little is
known about the biological mechanisms underlying learning and memory in early life, with the exception
of the effects of trauma and stress. Understanding the mechanisms underlying learning and memory in
early development is key for comprehending how the learning and memory systems are built and
function throughout life, as well as to better elucidate the deficits associated to neurodevelopmental
disabilities.
 One of the most important systems operating in the brain is the medial temporal lobe-dependent memory
system, which processes information about episodic, spatial, contextual and social experiences. Until recently
it was believed that this memory system does not function in infancy because it is developmentally immature,
and only begins to be involved late in development. However, recent studies in rodent models, including our
own, showed that episodic and spatial forms of learning require the function of biological mechanisms in the
dorsal hippocampus (dHC), a main region, together with the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), of the medial
temporal lobe memory system. Despite this recent progress, knowledge of the biological and system-level
mechanisms of infantile, hippocampus-dependent learning and memory is lacking.
 To fill this knowledge gap we propose to employ rodent models of episodic and spatial learning, genetically
engineered mouse models, molecular imaging technology, spatial transcriptomics and RiboTag mouse
technology combined with omic analyses to pursue the following specific aims: (1) To map the distribution at
a system level (dHC and mPFC) of the cellular networks activated in response to episodic learning in infancy
and in memory recovery following reminders at later ages, and to test the malleability and roles of recovered
infantile memories in adult behavior. (2) To comprehensively profile in situ dHC and mPFC gene expression at
the level of the whole transcriptome, as well as obtain a comprehensive translatome specifically regulated in
excitatory and inhibitory neurons, in response to learning in both infant and adult brains.
 These experiments will provide an unprecedented amount of novel information regarding the biological and
system-level mechanisms underlying infantile learning and memory, as well as an invaluable source of
knowledge for generating novel hypotheses regarding neurodevelopmental and adult cognitive disorders."

geographically-adjacent NICUs, each with large neonatal populations, to increase subject availability, and draws
on the intellectual excellence of two respected academic neonatal divisions. The Center has consistently ranked
in the first or second quartile of NRN centers for number of infants enrolled in clinical trials, and ranks 6th in size,
as measured by enrollment in the generic database (GBD) of infants <29 weeks’ gestation.

goals of enhancing rigor and reproducibility through NIH peer review of all new protocols, promoting greater
availability of multisite clinical trial infrastructure to support trials from a wider range of investigators
through a more open, inclusive mechanism for study proposals, facilitating data sharing and access to
biospecimens through timely deposit of data and biospecimens into the NICHD Data and Specimen Hub

The dopamine D4 receptor (D4R) plays important roles in cognition, attention, and decision-making. The human
DRD4 gene is highly polymorphic, with different variants associated with various neuropsychiatric disorders. In
particular, VNTR variants (the three major ones are termed D4.2R, D4.4R, and D4.7R) are differentially associated
with ADHD and substance use disorders, with the D4.7R reliably associated with increased prevalence of ADHD
and substance use disorders (SUDs). Determining precise physiological roles of D4R signaling as well as
understanding the consequences of D4R variants in contributing to disease states has been hampered by the
lack of suitable compounds with high affinity, sufficient selectivity, characterized agonist-antagonist responses,
and/or suitable in vivo activity. Currently there are no known compounds with differential activity at D4R variants.
Therefore, we seek to develop new, optimized D4R ligands with variant-specific activity to expand our
understanding of D4R function and in the development of potential therapeutic compounds. D4.7R has altered
ability to heteromerize with dopamine D2 receptors (D2Rs) or α2A adrenergic receptors (α2ARs), when
compared to the more common D4.4R. Our team has discovered that D4R agonist A-412997 produces differential
signaling at D4.7R or D4.4R heteromerized with D2R or α2AR, and differential signaling at Gαi1 versus Gαo1. We
will leverage our existing library of A-412997 analogs, and create new rationally designed analogs, to identify
new pharmacological tools will have the potential to surmount current limitations on the understanding of the
functional significance of D4R VNTR polymorphisms. Novel D4R ligands also hold the potential to be used as
pharmacotherapeutics for SUD. Since there are no FDA-approved medications for the treatment of
psychostimulant use disorders, and no FDA-approved medications selective for D4R, novel pharmacological
tools targeting D4R variants can address multiple needs. The proposed research seeks to design, synthesize,
and evaluate new ligands using computational modeling approaches that exploit underexplored regions within
the D4R protein structure to develop selective D4.2R, D4.4R, and D4.7R ligands."
10818534,"Obstetric practices and treatments are steeped in tradition, often introduced without rigorous evaluation
based on “expert” opinion. Practices are often influenced by the media with societal acceptance then entering
common practice without an assessment for risk or benefit. Because obstetrics often impacts two patients it is
important to understand the potential consequences for both individuals when a new intervention, medication,
or device is introduced into clinical practice. A treatment may benefit the mother but harm the fetus or inversely
benefit the fetus but harm the mother. These adverse events have both social and financial implications for
both the family and society. In addition, new therapeutic interventions can be associated with increased
healthcare expenditures. These social and financial burdens need to be determined to help mold health care
policy and practice.
 Since its inception, the Eunice Kennedy Shriver NICHD Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units (MFMU) research
network has conducted clinical trials and observational studies that have provided new knowledge to our
understanding of pregnancy especially in the area of prematurity. Past studies have demonstrated the benefit
of 17-OH progesterone caproate to reduce the risk of preterm delivery and antibiotics to prolonged pregnancy
after premature preterm rupture of the membranes, among other effective interventions. Other studies have put
an end to expensive and ineffective interventions, such as fetal pulse oximetry and fetal heart rate ST segment
analysis, both of which failed to change delivery outcomes. MFMU network studies have played a significant
role in providing evidence for and against numerous practices over the past 26 years.
 In this application, we demonstrate that the investigators in the Department of Reproductive Biology at
Case Western Reserve University (CASE) have the ability to conduct collaborative research and have
successfully participated in the MFMU research network and are qualified to continue as a study center. Our
investigators have a diverse background in clinical trials and multi-center studies providing a depth of
experience for future as well as on-going studies. Our center has performed well in both recruitment and data
quality while maintaining high rates of participant retention. The CASE community (participating institutions and
medical school) has been and continues to be highly supportive of the CASE-MFMU study center and our
investigators. The CASE study center has provided leadership and participated in the administrative operations
that lead to the success of the entire MFMU network. Our use of administrative processes to improve
recruitment and hold down costs has been innovative. CASE provides a strong administrative and research
infrastructure such as the CASE-Clinical & Translational Science Collaborative to support our study center
operations. The CASE study center team is ideally positioned to provide leadership with exceptional
performance in the coming MFMU Network cycle."
10898883,"People with HIV (PWH) remain vulnerable to central nervous system complications (e.g., neurocognitive
impairment) despite antiretroviral therapy (ART) that suppresses viral replication. While many etiologies of these
complications exist, damage to the blood-brain-barrier (BBB), inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction are
consistently implicated, yet seldom studied simultaneously. PWH also use cannabis more frequently than the
general population and recent evidence by our group and others indicates that cannabis may protect PWH from
BBB damage by reducing inflammation and promoting mitochondrial homeostasis. The proposed
multidisciplinary, translational project will combine a clinical observational study with two preclinical models: a)
a technologically advanced brain chip model for BBB and b) personalized ex vivo/in vitro modeling of
mitochondrial toxicity in BBB cells to determine the effects of cannabis use on the BBB in PWH. Using this
multilevel approach, we will test the hypothesis that cannabis effects on the BBB vary based on patterns of use:
moderate use will be associated with beneficial effects, due to the anti-inflammatory properties of cannabis, but
chronic daily use will have detrimental effects. In a cohort of PWH and people without HIV (PWoH) across a
range of cannabis use from naïve to daily users, we will measure in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) a
panel of biomarkers that reflect the BBB, inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. These readouts will be
correlated with advanced permeability and multicompartment diffusion magnetic resonance imaging that will
identify global and regional variations in BBB leakage along with neuronal and glial microstructural properties
(Aim 1). We will model the BBB using 3D microfluidic cultures of brain endothelial and parenchymal cell subsets
to measure the effects of HIV and cannabinoids on BBB permeability, inflammatory gene expression, and
markers of mitochondrial function (Aim 2). Because responses to HIV and cannabis are often specific to
individuals or groups of individuals, we will use monocyte-derived macrophages and sera from the PWH and
PWoH in the observational study to determine the effects of cannabis (and HIV) on BBB cellular components
(astrocytes and endothelial cells), and on mitochondrial function, inflammatory gene expression, and BBB
biomarker gene expression (Aim 3). Thus, the proposed project will provide innovative clinical readouts in a
unique cohort alongside state-of-the-art modeling of the BBB and personalized investigation of pathogenic
mechanisms. This highly innovative, multidisciplinary research proposal is very likely to generate impactful
translational knowledge regarding mechanisms of pathogenesis and guide future therapeutic interventions. With
our combined clinical and pre-clinical expertise in HIV infection, substance abuse, BBB biology and imaging, and
mitochondrial homeostasis, we are uniquely suited to perform the proposed research."

clinical trialists and neurodevelopmental specialists have successfully participated in multiple clinical trials,
including previous NRN experience during the 2001-2005 cycle; 3) Sharp’s integration of neonatal research
into clinical care which allows for recruitment 24/7 through highly trained personnel who attend all high-risk
deliveries and complete the antenatal consent process, with consent rates of over 80% for many clinical trials.
Specific Aim 1: Enroll diverse high-risk neonates into current and future NRN trials. The Sharp

NRI-CC PI, Anup Katheria, MD, has a proven track record of efficiency, leadership, and expertise. He designed
and led several large multicenter RCTs and routinely conducts multiple trials simultaneously, including
Premature Infants Receiving Milking or Delayed Cord Clamping trial (PREMOD2, 20 centers, N=1,200, est.
completion 9/2022) and completed enrollment in the Umbilical Cord Milking in Non-Vigorous Infants trial
(MINVI, 10 centers, N=1,730). Both trials enrolled nearly 3,000 participants for secondary studies. Despite
PREMOD2 being temporarily stopped, these trials continued enrolling during the pandemic; enrollment was
completed in 6 and 3 years (with ongoing 2-year follow-up), respectively. His experienced investigative team
including two senior investigators who led the NRN SUPPORT trial and its neurodevelopmental follow-up
component, coupled with a productive research team with a strong history of conducting multiple neonatal
clinical studies, will provide additional expertise to the NRN.
Specific Aim 3: Prioritize long-term neurodevelopmental follow-up in all research trials. The Sharp High
Risk Infant Follow-Up program provides longitudinal, comprehensive neurodevelopmental assessments for
newborns delivered at Sharp and enrolled in clinical trials that helped increase the overall neonatal follow-up
rates to above 85% for recent clinical research trials."
10928085,"Project Summary:
During infection by arthropod borne flaviviruses such as Dengue (DV) and Zika (ZV), infected cells accumulate
non-coding RNAs termed Subgenomic Flaviviral RNAs (sfRNAs) that consist of the viral genomic RNA’s 3
untranslated region (UTR). sfRNAs are generated when the host 5 to 3 exoribonuclease Xrn1 encounters
exoribonuclease-resistant RNA (xrRNAs) structures in the genome’s 3 UTR that halt its progress. Analysis of
flaviviral genomes has revealed that the majority of mosquito-borne flaviviruses have multiple xrRNAs “in
tandem”. It was hypothesized that these structures were functionally redundant and working independently to
generate sfRNA. However, data in our lab has revealed that within certain flaviviruses the structural integrity of
one xrRNA is sensed by the other, affecting its function. We hypothesize that this “coupling” or “coordination” is
due to tandem xrRNAs interacting through intervening sequences and/or structures. To test this hypothesis, we
developed a surrogate reporter system that allows us to test the functional effects of mutations in the intervening
sequence of the Dengue virus tandem xrRNAs. Specifically, our assay reports on changes in the patterns of
produced sfRNAs, which have been well characterized for the wild type sequences. For aim 1 we will use this
system to explore the mechanism of this coupling between xrRNAs in multiple flaviviruses. In addition, this
research will also include uncovering the mechanism in which sfRNAs interfere with the mosquito immune
response. Specifically, it has been shown that sfRNAs are capable of interacting with the mammalian Dicer
protein, reducing the amount of small interfering RNA (siRNA) formed in vitro. Since mosquitos rely on RNA
interference (RNAi) as their primary defense against viral infection, and mammalian and mosquito Dicer proteins
are well conserved, we hypothesize that sfRNAs dampen the RNAi response in mosquitos by interacting with
the Dicer-2 (Dcr2) protein of the mosquito RNAi pathway. Under aim 2 we will utilize a series of in vitro
biochemical assays to test how this interaction between sfRNA and Dcr2 is taking place and elucidate on how
sfRNAs work to dampen the immune response of the mosquito vector. Uncovering the dynamics of these host
pathogen interactions could lead to new strategies for attenuating sfRNA production in mosquitos to curb the
spread of flaviviruses."

The pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) interacts with the basal ganglia to enable smooth movement and is a
target for deep brain stimulation (DBS) in Parkinson's disease (PD). PD is the most common
neurodegenerative motor disorder, characterized by resting tremor, rigidity, slow movement, and postural
instability. Caudal-targeted DBS stimulation improves gait impairment in both patients and rodent PD models
whereas rostral-targeted DBS worsens it in rodent PD models. Effective PPN-targeted DBS may be attributed
to increasing alpha oscillations in the caudal PPN generated by closed-loop circuits and increasing neuronal
activity across the PPN. Contradictory outcomes of PPN-targeted DBS in both patients and rodent models
suggest functional heterogeneity within the PPN and differences between its rostral and caudal subregions. To
understand how DBS differentially modulates movement within the PPN, it is critical to dissect the functional
subpopulations within the PPN and determine how they communicate with the basal ganglia. In this proposal, I
focus on the cholinergic PPN neurons whose selective degeneration in PD also correlates with gait
impairment. I will use ex vivo whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology, optogenetics, calcium imaging, and
retro bead labeling (1) to characterize the intrinsic electrophysiological properties and identify a molecular
marker that differentiates rostral and caudal cholinergic PPN neurons in adult mice, (2) to characterize and
comprehensively map the regional connectivity of inhibitory synaptic inputs to the PPN, and (3) to identify
closed-loop circuits between the inhibitory basal ganglia nuclei and the PPN. Our preliminary data show that
the two major inhibitory basal ganglia nuclei, the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) and globus pallidus
externus (GPe), differentially project to the rostral and caudal PPN in axon imaging. Using optogenetics with
whole cell patch clamp and calcium imaging, we can confirm the functional connectivity of these anatomical
axonal projections and characterize inhibitory currents from the SNr and GPe on the PPN. Using
immunostaining, I will test the differential expression of five proteins selectively expressed in the PPN
compared to other brain regions to identify a molecular marker that can be used as a tool to genetically access
the rostral and caudal PPN. Using optogenetics and retrobead-labeling, I will determine whether SNr- and
GPe-projecting PPN neurons also receive inhibitory input from the respective basal ganglia nuclei, forming a
closed-loop circuit. This proposal will comprehensively characterize and map the regional connectivity of the
SNr and GPe to the cholinergic PPN and identify closed-loop circuits that can help us understand how the PPN
interacts with the basal ganglia to modulate movement and how its degeneration underlies motor deficits in
PD. These findings will guide new pharmacological targets and DBS-targeting of the PPN circuit in PD
patients."

Osteoarthritis, stroke, spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, and amputation affect roughly 19% of the U.S.
adult population, with osteoarthritis and stroke being leading causes of serious long-term disability in adults
worldwide. Along with other conditions such as cerebral palsy, Parkinson's disease, and orthopedic cancer,
these conditions often significantly impair movement, resulting in substantial societal costs, an increased risk of
other serious health conditions (e.g., heart disease and diabetes), a reduction or even loss of independence,
and a decreased quality of life. Despite the significance of the problem and the uniqueness of each patient,
treatment design for movement impairments has not progressed substantially beyond off-the-shelf
interventions selected based on subjective clinical judgment. If affected individuals are to recover the most
function possible, a paradigm shift is needed toward personalized interventions designed using objective
evidence-based methods.
 This project seeks to develop innovative software technology that will allow engineers working in
collaboration with clinicians to design effective personalized interventions for movement impairments using
objective physics-based computer models. The software technology will employ the same computer modeling
and simulation methods that have revolutionized the design of airplanes and automobiles over the past 25
years. The proposed software will create a virtual representation of the patient and then apply virtual
treatments to the virtual patient to identify the treatment design that is most likely to maximize recovery of lost
function. Virtual patient models will obey laws of physics and principles of physiology to reflect how the patient
moves before treatment and predict how the patient will move after treatment. To enable fast and easy
construction of patient models and optimization of patient functional outcomes, the software technology will be
incorporated into the NIH-funded OpenSim software for modeling and simulation of human movement.
 To support development and adoption of the proposed software, the project will also use the software to
design personalized interventions for three individuals post-stroke with impaired, asymmetric walking function.
The research team will organize a three-year “Stroke Grand Challenge Competition,” held each year at the
same professional conference, to engage the research community in model-based personalized treatment
design. An extensive human movement data set will be collected from each subject to be used for constructing
a virtual model of the subject. Competing research teams will use the software and the subject's virtual model
to design personalized treatments that improve the subject's walking symmetry. In addition, the research team
will use the new software to develop its own personalized intervention designs for the same subjects. Any
clinically promising interventions identified by either competition participants or the research team will be
implemented on the same subjects in a follow-on project to evaluate their efficacy."

This project has two complementary goals: (1) to advance discovery of genes involved in
substance use disorders using new multivariate genomic techniques, and (2) to characterize the
risk associated with identified variants in diverse longitudinal samples in order to understand the
spectrum of phenotypes associated with identified variants, across development, and in
conjunction with the environment. Each of these areas represents critical steps in using genetic
data to improve prevention, intervention, and treatment for substance use disorders (SUDs),
and will lay the foundation as we move into an era of personalized medicine. Human gene
identification efforts for substance use disorders lag behind other areas of psychiatry, in part
due to constrained sample sizes of available SUD cases. However, recent meta-analyses of
substance-related phenotypes such as age of initiation, consumption and problems, reveal
significant genetic correlations across substance use outcomes, as well as with numerous other
psychiatric and behavioral traits. These findings map onto twin data demonstrating significant
genetic correlations across substance use disorders and other externalizing traits. This project
will (Aim 1) apply new multivariate genetic methods to capitalize on genetic sharing between
substance use phenotypes and related traits in order to boost power to detect common variants
associated with substance use outcomes, and to characterize the latent pathways by which
genetic variants operate. Bioinformatic characterization of these identified genetic variants will
provide insight into underlying biological risk pathways, and phenotypic characterization of
resultant polygenic risk scores will help us understand how risk unfolds across development and
in conjunction with the environment. We will apply results from the multivariate analyses to two
complementary longitudinal datasets, consisting of a population-based and high-risk sample, in
order to (Aim 2a) map the behavioral phenotypes associated with the genetic risk scores
identified in Aim 1 across adolescence and emerging adulthood; (Aim 2b) test for pathways of
risk specific to sex and racial/ethnic background; and (Aim 2c) test for moderation of genetic risk
by key environmental factors. Jointly, these analyses will advance our understanding of how
genetic variation contributes to risk for substance use disorders."
10914046,"Project Summary/Abstract
Women with physical disabilities experience stark disparities in pregnancy care, complications, and outcomes,
compared to women without disabilities. Black women and Latinas also experience substantial disparities
related to perinatal care and outcomes, compared to White women. Black women and Latinas with physical
disabilities, thus, are presumably at heightened risk of adverse experiences and outcomes. Nonetheless, no
known studies have investigated the intersection of disability and race/ethnicity in relation to perinatal care and
disparities. Preliminary findings from the investigator team demonstrate that Black women and Latinas with
physical disabilities are at substantial risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes. Efforts to improve their pregnancy
care and experiences while reducing costs require a definitive assessment of these women’s pregnancy risks
and outcomes. The overarching goal of this study is to use a mixed-methods approach to understand
pregnancy experiences, maternal and infant outcomes, related healthcare costs, and unmet perinatal
healthcare needs of Black women and Latinas with physical disabilities and their infants, and examine the
intersecting impacts of disparities from two avenues of marginalization (race or ethnicity, and physical
disability). The specific aims of this study are: 1) Compare perinatal care receipt, pregnancy-related
complications, health outcomes, inpatient healthcare utilization and costs among cohorts of women based on
race, ethnicity, and physical disability status, and determine if the combined effects of being a Black woman or
Latina with physical disabilities are additive or multiplicative; 2) Use linked data from Georgia, California, and
Massachusetts to examine first year health outcomes, healthcare utilization and costs for cohorts of women
based on race, ethnicity, and physical disability and their infants (<1 year old), and determine if the combined
effect of being a Black woman or Latina with physical disabilities is additive or multiplicative; and 3) Identify
unmet needs and barriers to perinatal care for Black women and Latinas with physical disabilities through: (a)
interviews with Black women and Latinas with physical disabilities who are currently pregnant or have recently
given birth, and (b) focus groups with obstetric care providers. This study will lead to a first-ever systematic
understanding of pregnancy and infant health outcomes and pregnancy care costs for Black women and
Latinas with physical disabilities, thus establishing a foundation for development and testing of future
interventions to improve outcomes. This study will fill a critical knowledge gap in understanding of the
pregnancy-related experiences among Black women and Latinas with physical disabilities before, during and
after pregnancy."
10901976,"ABSTRACT: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is a spectrum of liver disease ranging from steatosis
(nonalcoholic fatty liver, NAFL) to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with fibrosis. Hepatic Stellate Cells
(HSCs) play a critical role in the pathogenesis of NASH. In response to chronic toxic injury, quiescent HSCs
(qHSCs) activate into aHSCs/myofibroblasts, that secrete the extracellular matrix to promote liver fibrosis. The
mechanism of NASH-mediated activation of human HSCs is not well understood. Phenotypic changes in HSCs
occur without a change in the DNA sequence but are regulated on an epigenetic level, e.g. specific
modifications in the chromatin structure, which affect DNA accessibility of the regulatory transcription factors
(TFs), causing transcriptional activation or repression of their target genes. We will analyze normal, NAFL, and
NASH livers that have been declined for liver transplantation. We will compare our observations in human
HSCs to the well characterized foz/foz mouse model of NASH. Our proposed study will integrate state-of-the-
art single-cell-based technologies, a) Single cell (sc)RNA-Seq on purified human HSCs will identify major
human HSC subsets; b) Single nuclei (sn)ATAC-Seq and snRNA-Seq will be performed using whole liver
tissue to capture and characterize the areas of open chromatin and matching gene expression of individual
HSCs; c) Transcriptional activity of the regulatory promoter/enhancer elements will be further accessed using
PLAC-Seq followed by ChIP-Seq with H3K27ac, a mark associated with cellular activation (HiChIP-Seq). The
transcriptome (AIM 1) and epigenome (AIM 2) of human HSCs, the genome-wide locations of the regulatory
elements and their corresponding TFs that regulate distinct HSC phenotypes and drive NAFL®NASH
progression, will be determined. Motif enrichment analysis of regions exhibiting characteristics of active
enhancers in combination with gene expression data will enable inference of major classes of transcription
factors critical for specific subsets of human HSCs. The factors that drive human HSC activation and thereby
promote NAFL progression to NASH will be identified. Selected targets (AIM 3) will be evaluated using the
experimental model of NASH in Western-diet (WD)-fed foz/foz mice, using ablation of individual aHSC subsets
(via overexpression of Diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) in Col1a1+ aHSCs in a Cre-loxP-dependent manner), or
HSC-specific knockout of the key TFs. Specific factors that prevent or suppress HSC activation (for example,
Etv1, E3F3, Egr2, NRF1, Tal1, Atf3) will be pharmacologically targeted, and the in vivo effect of treatment on
Co1a1+ aHSC activation will be monitored in live WD-fed reporter LratCol1a1-Fluc foz/foz mice (that upregulate Col-
1a1-driven Luciferase in mouse aHSCs), or humanized patient-specific xenograft Rag2-/-gc-/- mice. Overall, we
anticipate identifying new targets for the antifibrotic therapy of NASH."

Mitochondrial apoptosis is a stress-triggered cell death pathway implicated in health and disease. This
pathway is readily blocked in cancer. Mitochondrial poration is at the heart of mitochondrial apoptosis being
regulated by the BCL-2 proteins. This process regulates the release from mitochondria of prodeath factors that
activate the caspase cascade which dismantles apoptotic cells. Mitochondrial poration is executed by the
BCL-2 protein BAK. Here we propose to delineate the mechanism of mitochondrial poration by BAK, which is
elusively defined and controversial. In particular, we propose to elucidate 1) the mechanism of BAK activation,
2) BAK association with and poration of membranes, and 3) BAK recognition and sequestration by prosurvival
BCL-2 proteins. To accomplish these aims we will use a multi-pronged approach including high-resolution
structural biology, biophysics, biochemistry, and cell biology to generate a complete picture of mitochondrial
poration by BAK. Upon successful completion we will redefine our mechanistic understanding of this process,
and we will reveal innovative ways to target apoptosis in pathophysiology."
10906184,"PROJECT SUMMARY
An important goal in neuroscience is to elucidate with cellular and molecular clarity how neurodegeneration (ND)
might occur in vivo, given the intricate signaling and interactions among neurons and glia in the brain. This
application aims to understand a fundamental G Protein Coupled Receptor (GPCR) signaling pathway in both
programmed neuronal death (PND) and insult-induced ND (IND). IND will be studied in in the context of Gaucher
disease (GD), a multisystemic disorder including neuropathology before the age of three and Parkinson’s
disease (PD).
 It is well known that neuronal death occurs both in development and in diseased conditions. During
development, PND is critical for constructing a functional nervous system, e.g. by providing signals for the
colonization of microglia. On the other hand, IND due to injury or disease processes significantly impairs the
nervous system function. Studies employing invertebrate model organisms have provided insights. How PND
and IND are mechanistically regulated in vertebrates, however, is not well understood.
 Through an unbiased whole organism-based small molecule screen employing a chemo-genetic
nitroreductase/metronidazole (NTR/MTZ) dopamine (DA) neuron degeneration model in zebrafish, we have
uncovered inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) that significantly protect neurons from both PND
and IND. RAS is a peptidergic GPCR signaling system found in vertebrates, classically known to regulate blood
pressure and salt retention. RAS inhibitors are widely used drugs for treating high blood pressure. The
mechanism of action of RAS in ND however remains poorly understood, despite that RAS expression is detected
in both neurons and glia, and altered expression is observed during aging, in multiple ND diseases, and inhibitors
of RAS are in clinical trials for treating ND.
 We further find that inhibiting RAS signaling reduces DA ND in GD. Microglial colonization in the healthy
developing brain is also significantly decreased upon RAS inhibition. Built on these preliminary data, we
hypothesize that RAS signaling regulates both PND and IND outside its conventional role in the vascular system
but involves neurons and glia. This hypothesis will be tested in both PND and IND, using a combination of
molecular genetic, chemical genetic, and advanced microscopic imaging methods.
Expected outcomes and impact: Through a systematic screen, we have uncovered a role of RAS signaling in
both PND and IND in a highly accessible vertebrate model organism. The proposed research will create new
fundamental knowledge to address the underlying mechanisms. Inhibitors of RAS signaling have clinical
implications for treating ND diseases. By addressing the mechanisms of action for these agents, our research is
well in line with NIH’s strategic plan to benefit human health through basic science research."

 Proper B cell development is an essential part of innate and adaptive immunity. Coordination of a
number of molecular mechanisms are required to facilitate B cell development, maturation, activation, and
survival of B cells. Recently, the ubiquitin E3 ligase, UBR5 has been found mutated in a significant number of
cases of patients with mantle cell lymphoma, implicating the E3 ligase in B cell development. UBR5 is a key
regulator of DNA damage repair, transcription, translation, and our data suggests mRNA splicing via the
spliceosome. UBR5 is a HECT domain ligase, which contains a cysteine residue that is responsible for
ubiquitin transfer to its substrates. To elucidate the role of UBR5 in B cell maturation and activation we
generated a conditional mutant disrupting the C-terminal HECT domain. Loss of the HECT domain leads to a
block in maturation of B cells in the spleen with a reduction of B1 and marginal B cell subsets, as well as
phenotypic alterations and functional defects of follicular B cells. Proteomic studies reveal up-regulation of
spliceosome proteins in B cells lacking the HECT domain of UBR5, and that UBR5 interacts with splicing
factors. To further understand the functional role of UBR5 in regulating B cells activation and maturation and
the consequences of aberrant spliceosome component expression, we will define the role of UBR5 during
germinal center formation and activation (Aim 1), determine the ubiquitin independent vs. dependent function
in B cells (Aim2), and identify the role of spliceosome and altered transcripts in B cell activation (Aim 3). These
studies will unravel a novel role of UBR5 in B cell maturation by regulating alternative splicing of key transcripts
during B cell development."
10880589,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
The goal of this project is to adapt the empirically-validated FOCUS intervention and test its feasibility and
acceptability among sexual and gender minority (SGM) cancer patients and their caregivers. SGM cancer
patients face unaddressed challenges that adversely impact their quality of life (QOL), including minority stress,
or the chronic stress engendered by living with a stigmatized SGM identity. Furthermore, caregivers of SGM
patients are often not acknowledged in healthcare systems primarily designed to serve heterosexual/cisgender
(H/C) patients; resources for caregivers of H/C patients often do not address their needs; SGM patients may be
more likely to rely on SGM friends or ex-partners as caregivers; and these diverse SGM caregivers may be
affected by minority stress in cancer care settings. Psychoeducational interventions are needed to address these
disparities and improve the QOL of SGM cancer patients and their caregivers together. The FOCUS intervention
uses both psychoeducation and problem solving to improve QOL, coping, and self-efficacy in cancer patients
and their caregivers, and has been shown to be efficacious in three prior clinical trials. However, as noted by our
SGM community partners, the LGBT Cancer Action Council (CAC), its content has not been tailored to SGM
relationships. Consequently, we propose to adapt the evidence-based FOCUS Program for SGM cancer
patients and their caregivers (Aim 1). In collaboration with the LGBT CAC and guided by the transtheoretical
SGM-affirmative adaptation model and ADAPT-ITT framework, we will conduct 6 focus groups with ≥24 SGM
cancer patients and their ≥24 caregivers to “theater test” FOCUS and elicit qualitative feedback about adaptation.
We will also elicit feedback from our panel of 5 topic experts in SGM research, and create a manualized, adapted
intervention called FOCUS-SGM. We will then assess the feasibility and acceptability and explore potential
outcomes of the adapted FOCUS-SGM intervention in a two-arm pilot trial (Aim 2). We will randomize 80
SGM cancer patients and their caregivers (total N≥160) to either FOCUS-SGM or a waitlist control. Assessment
of patients and caregivers will occur at baseline, post-intervention, and at a 3-month follow-up (~6 months
after baseline). We hypothesize that it will be feasible to recruit a sample of SGM cancer patients and caregivers
through clinic, community, and online approaches; at least 80% of SGM patients and caregivers will be highly
satisfied with the content and delivery of FOCUS-SGM; 75% will complete 3 or more FOCUS-SGM sessions;
and 75% will complete post-intervention and 3-month follow-up assessments. We will also explore whether
potential outcome measures (QOL, coping, self-efficacy to manage cancer, relationship communication, and
minority stress) are responsive to the effect of FOCUS-SGM versus control. This grant represents a critical step
in preparing our team to conduct a definitive trial of FOCUS-SGM, responds to community and NCI priorities,
and has potential to address QOL disparities in SGM populations."
10925361,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
At least 14 million people in the U.S. are blind or living with a vision impairment (VI), and the number
affected is projected to double by 2050 due to aging and growth of the U.S. population. The majority
of those with VI and blindness are older adults aged ≥65 years. Racial and ethnic minorities are also
disproportionately affected, in part due to social determinants of health (SDoH) like healthcare
access, economic stability, and features of the built environment. Particularly in later life, VI is thought
to be associated with a host of adverse outcomes, including dementia, admission to a long-term care
facility, and even mortality. Nonetheless, rigorous and generalizable research on how SDoH impact
vision and eye health, and how vision influences late-life outcomes has been limited due to a lack of
data that: (i) is longitudinal; (ii) is representative of the U.S. population; (iii) contains objective
assessments of visual function; and (iv) samples older adults. In the proposed project, we will
address this barrier using newly collected vision data from the NIH-funded National Health and Aging
Trends Study (NHATS), an ongoing nationally representative panel study of >7,000 adults aged ≥65
years. In 2021, NHATS began annual measurement of distance and near visual acuity and contrast
sensitivity. In Aim 1 of the proposed study, we use NHATS data to provide the first-ever estimates on
the incidence of VI and blindness at the national level, as well as national prevalence estimates
stratified by age, sex, and race and ethnicity. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the longitudinal influence of
SDoH on vision health. To do so, we will utilize individual-level indicators of SDoH from NHATS, and
neighborhood level-indicators from the NIH-funded National Neighborhood Data Archive that is linked
to NHATS. In Aim 3, we will investigate the longitudinal impact of VI and blindness on the
development of dementia, placement in long-term care, and all-cause mortality. In a sub-aim, we will
use a longitudinal mediation model to test whether the influence of SDoH on adverse late-life
outcomes is mediated by vision and eye health. To date, it has not been possible to carry out
nationally representative studies on the associations of VI with SDoH and key late-life outcomes due
to the lack of longitudinal and objectively measured visual function data in a national sample. Thus,
the proposed studies will address critical scientific gaps. This proposal is also highly responsive to the
National Eye Institute’s new 5-year Strategic Plan, including: (i) to gather current epidemiologic data;
(ii) to support research at the nexus of SDoH and the healthcare system; and (iii) to explore research
encompassing comorbidities. Epidemiological estimates will be made publicly available and all study
findings will be widely disseminated to maximize the impact of these studies on public health and
policy and to optimize vision and overall health and wellbeing for an aging U.S. population."

One of biology’s central challenges to define the mechanisms by which the single cell zygote assembles itself
into the complex body plan of an animal. For the last 27 years we have addressed this fundamental question,
following the lead initially provided by the dual functions of bcatenin in cell adhesion and Wnt signaling. We
seek to determine how cells assemble polarized tissues and organs and change shape and move during
morphogenesis, by coordinating cell adhesion and the cytoskeleton. In parallel, we study Wnt signaling, a
paradigm for mechanisms cells use to choose and maintain fate in development and homeostasis and how this
goes wrong in disease. We study these events in Drosophila, using its sophisticated genetic tools along with
cutting edge microscopy to explore events in vivo, and combine this with work in cultured mammalian cells, to
explore conservation and divergence of these mechanisms. Many of the proteins on which we focus are
disrupted in human developmental disorders, cancer initiation and metastasis. Currently we explore three key
questions in the field. First, we ask how cells initiate and maintain apical-basal polarity, a fundamental property
of animal tissues. Cell-cell adherens junctions serve as key polarity landmarks, demarcating the apical and
basolateral domains. Our goal is to determine how different upstream inputs are integrated to position
adherens junctions during apical-basal polarity establishment, and to define mechanisms ensuring robust
polarity maintenance. We hypothesize that the egg plasma membrane and the polarized cytoskeleton it
organizes act through multiple effectors to position adherens junctions, with junctional proteins acting as
coincidence detectors, and that new mechanisms turn on at gastrulation onset, buffering errors during
cellularization. Second, we explore mechanisms by which cell-cell junctions link to the actomyosin cytoskeleton
to allow cell shape change without disrupting epithelial integrity. We hypothesize different cells choose from an
array of proteins/protein complexes to assemble and link adherens junctions, with different proteins
contributing distinct dynamics or force resistance, and that multivalent interactions among the proteins
increases robustness. In parallel, we ask how upstream signaling cues drive integrated cytoskeletal responses
in morphogenesis, using Abl kinase as a model. Third, we explore how cells choose and maintain fate, using
Wnt signaling as a model. We focus on the tumor suppressor Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), a key
negative regulator that is mutated in 80% of colon cancers. Our long-term goal is to determine how APC and
its partners in the Wnt-regulatory destruction complex regulate signaling during development and homeostasis,
and how that goes wrong in cancer. We hypothesize that the destruction complex is a multimeric machine
assembled by polyvalent interactions, that its cellular localization and assembly state are regulated by Wnt
signaling acting via regulated Dsh:Axin interactions, and that the F-box protein Slimb/TrCP carries bcatenin to
the E3 ligase. This process provides a paradigm for how regulated protein stability regulates cell signaling."

Purpose
 The New Mexico Department of Health Scientific Laboratory Division (NMDOH SLD)
has participated in the Retail Meat Surveillance (RMS) since 2004.The RMS study has
traditionally focused on retail meat samples like raw chicken, ground turkey, ground beef,
and pork that are derived from farm based live-stock animals such as bovines, poultry,
and swine. The associated bacterial targets from these meat matrices have been
Salmonella species, Campylobacter species (primarily C. jejuni and C. coli),
Enterococcus species, and E. coli. Recently the National Antimicrobial Resistance
Monitoring System (NARMS) program has moved in a strategic direction with an
emphasis on a One Health model of monitoring, which is a multisectoral and
transdisciplinary approach that looks at the interconnections between people, animals,
plants, and the environment. This has and will continue to bring about new pilot studies
that will expand testing to other meat matrices as well as to environmental samples such
as surface waters and soils.
 The Environmental Microbiology (EM) Laboratory at NMDOH SLD is currently
participating in the latest NARMS pilot study involving seafood and is doing well with
isolating the intended targets: Vibrio species, Aeromonas species, Enterococcus species,
and Lactose fermenters. EM Laboratory enjoys participating in the pilot study and
currently has some method modifications to better improve recovery of some of the listed
targets. The seafood pilot study is particularly important because the consumption of
seafood, particularly aquaculture products, is projected to significantly increase and such
industries rely heavily on the use of antibiotics to combat infectious diseases that threaten
production.
 Purchasing activities have been limited, in terms of the monthly shopping frequency for
raw meat samples and time allotments for such operations (limited to 3 hours), due to a
shortage of qualified purchasing personnel equipped with P-cards. The EM Laboratory
was recently provided with a P-card which will make it possible to expand shopping /
sample gathering capabilities for the start of this upcoming grant cycle. No longer will the
EM Laboratory be limited to just one shopping event per month, but instead is planning
on going once per week. EM Laboratory personnel will additionally be able to purchase
retail meat samples from other cities across the entire state of New Mexico that previously
was not possible. Such temporal and geographical expansions should overall provide for
more meaningful data to the NARMS program.
Expected Outcomes
 The goal of this study is to determine the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among
Salmonella, Campylobacter, E. coli and Enterococci isolated from retail samples of retail
chicken, ground turkey, ground beef and pork chops purchased from grocery stores in
New Mexico. The information obtained will also help our epidemiologists better
understand the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in New Mexico. The laboratory will
continue to provide testing for this project following established procedures and also
participate in any pilot studies that are introduced. The approval of a P-card for the EM
section will allow for additional coverage with the state of New Mexico over the five-year
grant project.

10906776,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Though trauma is often considered an isolated disease process, advancements in acute care have shifted the
burden of injury from the acute physiologic insult to the chronic post-injury sequalae. Over 95% of hospitalized
trauma patients now survive to discharge. However, many go on to suffer long-term consequences of injury in
the form of worsened functional status, mental health, and health-related quality of life. These trauma-initiated
chronic conditions make it difficult for many working-age adults to return to work and economic productivity.
The combination of poor clinical outcomes and work loss may be further compounded by unexpected medical
debt as many working-age adults carry high-deductible insurance plans. Unfortunately, there is a paucity of
information regarding long-term clinical and economic outcomes after major injury in the US. As a result, the
policy interventions needed to optimize long-term recovery after major injury remain unknown. The purpose of
this proposal is to close these key knowledge gaps and map a policy response moving forward. The specific
research aims of this proposal are to evaluate (i) long-term clinical outcomes and (ii) long-term economic
outcomes among working-age survivors of traumatic injury; and to evaluate (iii) the impact of alternative
insurance design strategies on long-term outcomes after traumatic injury. The proposed study leverages a
unique data opportunity at our institution and will be the first of its kind to combine a state-wide trauma registry
(containing both inpatient data and long-term patient-reported outcomes) with 24 months of pre-injury and 24
months of post-injury consumer credit reports. We will use the evidence from these novel analyses to simulate
changes in insurance benefit design in order to optimize return to work and mitigate financial strain after injury.
This project will also facilitate the career development of the candidate. The highly experienced and
multidisciplinary mentorship team, the proposed career development and research plan, and the unparalleled
research environment are ideally suited to address the career goals and educational needs of the candidate PI,
John W. Scott, MD, MPH. Although he has substantial prior experience in surgical health services research, he
lacks experience with (i) longitudinal data analysis, (ii) evaluating personal financial data, and (iii) policy
simulation methods. In addition to the innovative research plan, this proposal also includes additional training
which will be essential both for the successful completion of this research and for Dr. Scott’s career
development, including graduate level courses and experiential learning opportunities. This career
development award will lay the groundwork for Dr. Scott to mature as an independent investigator and national
leader in improving long-term clinical and economic outcomes after acute illness and injury through policy
evaluation and reform."

Drug-resistant bacterial infections pose a serious and growing public health threat
globally. In order to enhance the antibiotic resistance surveillance data for the National
Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS), the WAPHL proposes a
continued collaboration with FDA to survey antibiotic resistance of bacteria isolated from
retail meat and seafood in Washington’s Puget Sound Region.
The primary outcomes we hope to achieve as a result of our project are to maintain the
ability to: 1) Collect and process samples within a relevant time frame, such as that
described in the FDA protocol and guidelines 2) Perform microbiological tests, such as
those described in the project protocol, of the total samples suggested by the FDA 3)
Utilize results from the project to analyze quality assurance practices 4) Integrate and
coordinate surveillance activities 5) Exchange relevant and complete surveillance data
6) Use data to inform program and policy development 7) Employ data for education on
current and emerging hazards 8) Support awareness of antimicrobial resistance among
the public 9) Identify foodborne illness outbreaks and coordinate outbreak investigations
10) Analyze antimicrobial resistance data in our jurisdiction over time 11) Defend our
jurisdictions involvement in protecting and promoting the public's health.
Funds from this award will be used over the next 5 years to: 1) enhanced outbreak
investigation response and reporting 2) improve surveillance to drive public health
action in WA State 3) seek collaboration opportunities among city, county, state, and
federal partners and other external partners 4) sustain and enhance our laboratory
diagnostic capabilities 5) improve laboratory coordination and outreach/information flow
in order to coordinate stronger connections between our communicable disease
epidemiologists and laboratory functions at the state and local levels in WA State 6)

Data obtained from this project will help to determine prevalence trends of bacteria and
their antibiotic resistance in retail meats and seafood within Washington State.
Additionally, it will also be used to inform policy, affect regulatory actions, monitor trends
in resistance, raise awareness of the appropriate use of antibiotics to attain optimal
health for people, animals and our environment."
10813057,"Project Summary
Trauma-induced inflammation and multiple organ failure are major causes of mortality and
morbidity in American soldiers and veterans. Gut barrier dysfunction plays a critical role in the
development of posttraumatic complications by providing the major site for plasma leakage and
bacterial translocation. Leaky gut, a consequence of gut barrier damage during trauma, has not been
treated effectively. The pathology of leaky gut has not been fully characterized and its cellular and
molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. The overall objective of this application is to
expand my current project towards a new phase to further investigate the molecular control of cell
specific mechanisms that contribute to leaky gut during trauma and subsequent acute lung injury.
We hypothesize that thermal injury induced inflammation in gut tissue activates focal adhesion
pathways in intestinal epithelium resulting in epithelial junction disassociation, therefore, impairing
gut epithelial barrier integrity. The project will focus on 1) to analyze the molecular mechanism of
FAK mediated gut epithelial barrier dysfunction; 2) to evaluate the role of FAK activation and
therapeutic potential of FAK inhibition; 3) to identify and characterize leaky gut-produced circulator
factors that contribute to lung injury. The study design employs complimentary in vivo, ex vivo, and
in vitro models that incorporate molecular and genetic approaches into physiological experiments
under clinically relevant trauma conditions. The significance of the study lies in its potential not only
to contribute to the advancement of gastrointestinal pathobiology, but also to have clinical
implications in the development of effective therapies or surgical interventions against gut barrier
injury. In addition, the funding will support PI’s effort to participate in the VA services and the
collaboration with VA physicians and scientists."
10871913,"Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) results from a blood clot in the neurovasculature and is a leading cause of death
and neurological disability in the United States (US). AIS impacts more than 700,000 Americans annually, with
a 65% chance of death or severe disability. By 2030, it is expected that the AIS economic burden will exceed
$180B in the US alone.
 Standard AIS therapies include FDA-approved thrombolysis using alteplase (i.e., tissue plasminogen
activator, tPA) within 4.5 hours of stroke onset and earliest-possible thrombectomy for large vessel occlusions
(out to 24hrs). In contrast to thrombectomy, thrombolysis does not require confirmation of a vessel occlusion.
Because only ~10% of AIS victims are eligible for thrombectomy, thrombolysis remains a critical first line tool to
treat those diagnosed with AIS. When employed, thrombolysis is associated with a modest ~15% improvement
in stroke outcomes, resulting in only ~10% fully recovering. However, due to alteplase's ~7% dose-dependent
hemorrhage risk, thrombolysis remains contraindicated for mild and wake-up strokes which together make up
~60% of all AIS events. Currently, thrombolysis usage within the US remains low (~10%) with 90% of all AIS
victims only receiving palliative care. Thus, there is an urgent need to improve the efficacy and safety of
thrombolysis and extend thrombolysis to more AIS victims.
 UNandUP has invented a novel nanoparticle-based thrombolysis platform to safely accelerate alteplase to
AIS-associated blood clots, thereby overcoming restrictive hemodynamics known to prevent alteplase from
reaching the occlusion. The platform overcomes this barrier by 1) conveying alteplase-conjugated magnetic
nanoparticles to the clot’s surface more than 350X faster than normal biological diffusion (so that lysis starts
within minutes versus hours), and 2) mechanically mixing alteplase at the clot’s surface to improve lysis using
an alteplase dose nearly 250X lower than currently approved (which promises to eliminate alteplase’s elevated
hemorrhage risk). C3i participation and FDA/regulatory meetings confirm a likely CDER pathway which,
although lengthier and more costly than a CDRH pathway, results in a commercially attractive pharmaceutical
product. The platform is affordable to hospitals, does not require precise knowledge of the clot’s location, and
is intended to support EMT transfers between spoke and hub stroke centers, thereby ensuring thrombectomy
is not delayed. Once proven safe and effective, UNandUP’s goal is to extend the benefits of thrombolysis to
nearly all 700,000 AIS victims, which is 10X more than currently treated. By leveraging UNandUP’s prior
success in developing magnetic nanoparticles and portable magnet systems, the aims of this effort can focus
on synthesizing cGMP nanoparticles using proprietary magnetic cores and conducting safety and efficacy
studies in support of an FDA-CDER regulatory approval process."
10852904,"Optimal reward-guided behavior relies on intact connections between prefrontal cortex and striatum: circuitry
that is disrupted by frontal brain injury1,2. Sustaining a brain injury increases risk for developing depression,
anxiety, attention deficits, mood disorders and problems with impulse control3,4. The symptoms of frontal
traumatic brain injury (TBI) strongly resemble psychiatric disorders with regards to disruptions in reward-guided
behavior, and therefore may share common mechanisms driving behavioral impairments. Mechanisms may
include a combination of inflammatory, molecular, and cellular changes that are triggered by injury. Determining
which factors mediate persistent effects of behavior is necessary to understand chronic impacts of TBI and
develop treatments addressing the often debilitating symptoms enduring after injury. The proposed research will
examine how severe and mild frontal TBI impacts neural communication with its distributed striatal network to
influence reward-guided behavior. Identifying a neurophysiology signature associated with reward deficits would
provide a new target for brain-based treatment options. Neuromodulation, altering the electrical potentials of
the brain, may serve as a potential intervention to remediate behavioral deficits by restoring rhythmic brain
patterns and structural integrity of their underlying connections following injury. Preclinical testing in
translational animal models is critical to better understand the structural and functional mechanisms driving
behavioral impairments, and to test repetitive brain stimulation as a method to remediate effects of injury.
The first goal of this proposal is to quantify behavioral consequences of severe and mild frontal TBI made using
a controlled cortical impact (CCI) in rodents. TBI causes axonal shearing of white matter tracts and chronic
inflammation resulting in long-term changes to the brain’s microstructure. Abnormalities in corticostriatal
connectivity is being implicated in the onset of psychiatric-like symptoms, yet the relationship with TBI-induced
impairments remains unclear. As one of the most widely used injury models in animals, CCI produces focal
damage in rats that mirrors concussion, contusion, and hemorrhage in humans by driving an impactor directly
into the brain through a surgical opening in the skull30. The injury severity and location are controlled by the
experimenter and highly reproducible across animals. After injury, rats will perform a probabilistic reversal
learning task which requires reward-guided decision making, behavioral inhibition, flexible behavior, and
conditional discrimination: cognitive functions that all depend on intact prefrontal cortex. Reward-related
behavioral impairments on the reversal learning task will be related to microstructural changes.
To capture disturbances in the cortico-striatal network after TBI, brain activity will be recorded as rats run the
probabilistic reversal learning task. Neural activity is not random, it oscillates at periodic frequencies to coordinate
communication within and between distributed brain areas. Each of these frequency bands are predicted to
coordinate different aspects of behavior through long-range coupling in functional networks. Large-scale local
field potential probes will be used to record from 32 brain areas simultaneously capturing these oscillatory
dynamics during reward-guided behavior. Identifying frequency-specific activity that is disrupted by TBI, would
offer insight into the neural mechanisms of reward-guided behavior and point to a new therapeutic target.
Lastly, brain stimulation targeting the cortico-striatal network will be used to assess its effectiveness at inducing
neuroplasticity changes to remediate effects of TBI. We will follow neuromodulation procedures known to be
successful in humans with the goal of studying the structural and functional mechanisms associated with
restored reward-guided behavior. The proposal will examine if stimulation to lateral orbitofrontal cortex can
improve reward-guided behavior, restore cortico-striatal network activity, and induce long-term structural
changes. This research is critical to identify mechanisms of TBI and remediate reward-related impairments."
10906061,"Project Summary
Normal aging is typically associated with pervasive declines in cognitive, motor and sensory function, however,
there are substantial individual differences: some older adults experience mild impairments while others
experience severe cognitive declines. Understanding the neural bases of individual differences during aging is
imperative in designing future interventions to address age-related cognitive impairments. Using behavioural
testing, functional MRI, spectroscopy and pharmacological manipulations in human adults, I propose to
investigate the scope, cause and consequences of age-related decline in two neural factors that may play a
role in these individual differences: (1) neural distinctiveness (how similar/confusable neural activation patterns
are in response to different stimulus categories) and (2) brain signal variability (moment-to-moment change in
neural activity independent of task). Both these measures have been found to decline with age and both have
been associated with individual differences in behavior. During the predoctoral (F99) phase of the training, my
research will focus on healthy aging: 1) investigating the scope and cause (specifically role of GABA levels) of
age-related decline in neural distinctiveness in sensory regions, 2) the cause of age-related declines in brain
signal variability, and 3) the behavioral consequences of age-related declines in these two neural measures.
During the postdoctoral (K00) phase, I will extend my previous research to again study neural distinctiveness
and brain signal variability, but now in the context of memory and hippocampal dysfunction, and in a clinical
population (patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment, MCI). I will use task-based fMRI to measure neural
distinctiveness, resting-state fMRI to measure brain signal variability, and MR spectroscopy to measure levels
of various neurotransmitters (including glutamine, glutamate, NAA, and GABA), all in the hippocampus, in
healthy younger and older adults as well as MCI patients. I will also collect behavioral data from the same
participants during the Mnemonic similarity task (MST), a highly sensitive measure of hippocampal dysfunction.
I propose to investigate a) age-related changes in neural distinctiveness and resting state variability in the
hippocampus, b) the neurochemical basis of these neural changes, and c) the behavioral and pathological
consequences of these neural changes. For all the MCI patients, I will also have access to a rich dataset of
other biomarkers (e.g., longitudinal measures of CSF and PET-based amyloid and tau) collected at UCI’s
Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC). I will therefore be able to examine neural distinctiveness and
brain signal variability in the context of the Amyloid Tau Neurodegeneration (biomarker profiling) Framework.
Together, this research could lead to the development of preclinical markers for AD and open new avenues for
early pharmacological interventions to treat cognitive declines in healthy and pathological aging."

This collaborative technology focused project seeks to develop, characterize, and validate visible-light optical
coherence tomography (vis-OCT) as a functional tool to transform the clinical management of glaucoma. We will
address two unmet needs in clinical glaucoma diagnosis and detection of progression: (1) the ability to measure
retinal sublayer structure and (2) to accurately assess local retinal hemoglobin oxygen saturation (sO2). The
earliest structural changes in glaucoma are thought to be a retraction of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) dendrites in
the inner plexiform layer (IPL). Specifically, this would occur in the outer IPL, where RGC “off” cells synapse.
Identification of loss of synapses, either by decreased scattering or by the change in IPL sublayers’ thicknesses,
could serve as an earlier and more sensitive biomarker for glaucoma than any other. Measuring retinal sO2 and
specific arteriole-venule couplets can determine the oxygen extraction in the regions served by those vessels.
Our preliminary data indicate that regions showing damage in glaucomatous eyes have lower oxygen extraction
than similar areas in healthy eyes. Our observation suggests that such oxygen extraction abnormalities can be
measured well beyond the “floor effect” threshold noted with conventional OCT, allowing assessment of disease
beyond the time point that conventional structural OCT becomes insensitive. To achieve our long-term goal, we
will focus on new vis-OCT optical system design, imaging protocols, and data processing methodologies to
identify both metabolic and ultra-fine anatomical alternations in early glaucoma, both of which are beyond the
capabilities of existing imaging technologies."
10909255,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The rising prevalence of cirrhosis, the end-stage of any chronic liver injury, is a significant contributor to morbidity
and mortality in the United States. Preventative measures including treatment of underlying liver disease,
monitoring and screening for complications and addressing risk factors associated with disease progression are
key to improved survival. As cirrhosis progresses, complications such as liver failure and liver cancer develop,
resulting in death. Racial/ethnic minorities, individuals with substance use disorders, HIV infection, and those
with low socioeconomic status are all at high risk for cirrhosis complications due to comorbidities and barriers to
healthcare access. Liver transplantation is the only medically viable option in end stage liver disease but given
the shortage of organs and even more numerous patients who are unable to be considered for liver
transplantation listing, there is a significant need to improve our understanding of underlying pro- and anti-fibrotic
processes and risk factors along with potential therapies to halt disease progression. In addition, evaluation of
contribution of clinical risk and social determinants of health that may differentially impact cirrhosis burden in at
risk populations is critical to addressing disparities in cirrhosis burden in this country. Thus, effective strategies
for prevention of cirrhosis complications is a high-priority need. Accumulating evidence suggests that statin, a
lipid lowering drug, has a preventative role in cirrhosis. Statins improve portal venous pressure and decrease
liver cancer risk and mortality in cirrhosis in epidemiologic studies and limited clinical trials. However, large
pragmatic randomized controlled trials in patients with compensated cirrhosis are required to confirm these
observations. To address these gaps in knowledge about cirrhosis as well as the unmet clinical needs of patients
with the disease, two sites within the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) and their diverse community
links will contribute to the Liver Cirrhosis Network with the following specific aims: 1. To assemble a longitudinal
cohort with diverse etiology and stage of cirrhosis supported by comprehensive clinical measures and a
biospecimen repository in order to promote clinical and translational research in cirrhosis; 2. To conduct a
randomized controlled double-blind trial testing the efficacy and safety of a rosuvastatin versus placebo in
patients with compensated cirrhosis. Our short-term goals are to better characterize clinical risks and social
determinants of health associated with cirrhosis complications in at risk populations, to evaluate a Hippo pathway
related mechanism for cirrhosis progression (the YAP score), and to assess the role of rosuvastatin in
compensated cirrhosis and clinically significant portal hypertension from fatty liver disease (alcoholic and
nonalcoholic) and chronic viral hepatitis in those with or without HIV infection. The results are expected to have
broad implications, given that progressive fibrosis defines chronic injury not only in the liver but in essentially all
epithelial tissues."
10693580,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fastest growing
cause of HCC and predicted to become the leading indication for liver transplantation. As liver transplantation
remains a scarce resource, chemoprevention and early treatment are imperative. NAFLD patients represent a
distinct high-risk population due to the challenges of HCC screening related to obesity, potential absence of
elevated tumor markers, and the observation that 20-30% of cases occur in the absence of cirrhosis, who are
not targeted for screening. Given that early detection is key in improved survival and receipt of curative treatment,
understanding the mechanisms leading to NAFLD-related HCC have important clinical consequences. Although
lipophilic statins have been associated with decreased HCC incidence, their chemo-preventative mechanism(s)
remains elusive. Over the years, the YAP/TAZ cascade emerged as an important signal transduction pathway
in the pathogenesis of HCC, and has been shown to be modulated by changes in intracellular lipids. Stearoyl-
CoA desaturate (SCD), the rate limiting enzyme of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), is a key enzyme in
the Hippo pathway that links YAP/TAZ to sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1) and mTORC1 in
hepatocarcinogenesis. Using human liver bulk RNA sequencing studies of a prospective cohort of NAFLD/NASH
patients undergoing bariatric surgery, we discovered a novel regulatory role of SCD by a long non-coding
enhancer RNA. After characterizing the intracellular lipid pool with an SCD inhibitor, we next investigated the
role of SCD on the YAP/TAZ pathway using an in vitro cell culture model and demonstrate SCD-dependent
decrease on YAP protein and its target genes. Our preliminary data led us to hypothesize that SCD and
monounsaturated to saturated fatty acid ratios regulate and are a point of convergence in the YAP/TAZ,
mTORC1 and mevalonic acid pathways. In this proposal, we aim to delineate the mechanisms underpinning the
role of lipids in HCC through the YAP/TAZ pathway. In Aim 1, we will study cellular sub-types in HCC and
adjacent non-HCC human samples to identify how the YAP/TAZ pathway relates to lipid gene expression. Gene-
environment interactions with statin use will also be investigated using the Million Veteran Program, to identify
the sub-group of patients who would benefit from statin chemoprevention. In Aim 2, we test the hypothesize that
statins and the mevalonic acid pathway regulate YAP/TAZ function through Rho in hepatocytes and patient-
derived tumoroids. The effects of statin on cellular localization and phosphorylation of YAP/TAZ and the
YAP/TEAD-regulated genes will be examined. We will determine if these effects are dependent on Rho or
intracellular cholesterol/lipid metabolites. In Aim 3, the role of SCD on the regulation of YAP/TAZ, cell proliferation
and migration in a panel of hepatocytes and cancer cells will be examined. These studies will lead to further
understanding of the mechanisms of lipophilic statins and other lipid-modulating agents in chemoprevention and
identifying YAP/TAZ HCC cellular signatures, with the goal of advancing precision oncology in Veterans with
NAFLD-HCC. The training objectives in this proposal will foster Dr. Benhammou’s growth as a translational
cancer researcher, which are made possible by a rich scientific environment at the University of California, Los
Angeles and the VA Greater Los Angeles."
10891604,"Tezcat is an early-stage, biopharmaceutical company developing novel biologics with a unique
mechanism of action to treat the most recalcitrant cancers, such as mutant RAS multiple
myeloma. Multiple myeloma is an incurable hematologic malignancy with an expected median
survival of 7-8 years. Despite an initial response rate approaching 90% to proteasome inhibitor-
containing combinations, all patients relapse and eventually become resistant to any treatments.
Approximately 70% of these relapse/refractory patients harbor a mutation in RAS. We have
observed that mutant RAS multiple myeloma cells display high levels of macropinocytosis, a
nutrient scavenging process that facilitates the bulk engulfment of extracellular fluid and its
solutes. Our drug candidate, TZT-102, utilizes our proprietary macropinocytosis-selective
monobody that carries an FDA-approved cytotoxic payload. Results from our Phase I STTR
project demonstrate that TZT-102 has robust anti-tumor activity in mutant RAS MM xenograft
models without showing toxicity issues. Based on the success of our Phase I aims, we propose
a Phase II SBIR program for investigators at Tezcat to advance TZT-102 through Specific Aims
that will pursue bioanalytical assay development (Aim 1) and non-GLP toxicology studies in rats
(Aim 2) to prepare for a pre-IND meeting with the FDA (Aim 3). Tezcat has entered into a license
agreement with NYU Langone Health for exclusive, worldwide rights to the technology being
developed. The commercialization strategy will be based on further development through Phase
II SBIR studies and towards IND status and first-in-human clinical trials through a strategic
partnership. Thus, we expect this Phase II SBIR to provide additional support for pursuit of GMP
protocols and GLP safety and toxicity studies to support IND submission with the FDA."
10897955,"Aspergillus fumigatus is an environmental mold that is responsible for a life-threatening pneumonia
known as invasive aspergillosis. The infection begins with the inhalation of conidia (spores) into the lung. In a
healthy individual, the spores are cleared by the immune system. However, in the immunosuppressed
population, or patients in the ICU, failure to eradicate the fungus allows the spores to germinate. A. fumigatus
releases an armamentarium of degradative enzymes as it grows, resulting in severe damage to the lung
parenchyma. Fibroblasts are one of the major cell types that respond to tissue damage. In response to injury,
these cells differentiate into an activated state, which is required to stabilize the tissue and promote repair.
However, fibroblast activity is not restricted to matrix secretion; emerging evidence suggests that they also
possess the ability to detect microbial pathogens and to respond by secreting mediators with the potential to
contribute to pathogen clearance. In this grant, we propose to take advantage of unique genetic mouse models
that we have developed to determine the contribution of pulmonary fibroblasts to the outcome of A. fumigatus
exposure. We hypothesize that fibroblast activation in response to A. fumigatus-induced lung damage amplifies
a protective inflammatory response. The proposed aims will test this hypothesis by determining the dynamics of
fibroblast activation and deactivation in response to A. fumigatus in both immunocompetent and
immunosuppressed mice, the transcriptional response of fibroblasts to A. fumigatus exposure, and the
contribution of fibroblasts to pathogenic outcome in a mouse model of fibroblast ablation. The findings of this
study will provide new information on mechanisms of host defense against A. fumigatus and potentially other
pathogens that damage the human lung.

10901938,"Elastic, Degradable Vascular Grafts with Helical Microfibers
 When an artery occludes, rerouting blood flow with a vascular graft can save lives or limbs.
Autologous grafts are the preferred conduit for replacing small-diameter vessels. However, not all
patients have suitable donor vessels, and the wound healing complications associated with the
harvest can be severe. Synthetic grafts can be used but the foreign material does not degrade or
integrate with the host, leading to graft failure and risk of infection. These grafts function best in
large caliber arterial reconstruction but perform poorly in smaller arteries such as in the coronary
and below the knee arteries. We will overcome this challenge by using a degradable graft made of
elastomeric microfibers arranged in helices mimicking extracellular matrix fibers in the artery. Our
preliminary data in rats show these grafts remodel into compliant, elastic vascular conduits
resembling the native arteries. The proposed research will address two key questions for clinical
translation: 1) will host cells fully populate the long grafts needed for human applications and 2)
will the same transformation occur in aged patients and those with systemic diseases such as
diabetes? Correspondingly, Specific Aim 1 will investigate host remodeling of 7-inch-long
interposition grafts in a sheep carotid artery. Aim 2 will assess graft remodeling in Zucker Diabetic
Sprague-Dawley rats, a new polygenetic model of Type 2 diabetes. Aim 3 will evaluate the
effectiveness of controlled release of cytokines in the graft to overcome the limitations caused by
aging. Upon completion of this project, we expect to have a graft design ready for clinical
translation. The knowledge gained will have impact beyond vascular substitutes in the
development of other cardiovascular devices."
10891611,"ABSTRACT
Rural Alaska Native children experience a high prevalence of preventable childhood hearing loss. School-based
programs provide the only access to preventive services for many underserved rural and minority children, yet
loss to follow-up from school hearing screening is common and scarcity of specialists in rural areas compound
barriers to care. The Alaska Tribal Health System addresses geographic barriers to care with a telehealth
network, but the network is not used for school hearing screening and is only available in Tribal regions. This
proposal brings a novel telehealth model directly into schools to reach underserved rural and minority children
across the state of Alaska, including non-Tribal regions. The overall objective is to prospectively implement
and evaluate a new virtual specialty care model in Alaska schools to reduce loss to follow-up from school
hearing screening and improve access to specialty care in rural environments. This work builds on the
team’s recent PCORI-funded cluster-randomized trial that translated Alaska’s existing Tribal telehealth network
in village clinics to a prevention model for school hearing screening referrals. Children randomized to clinic-
based telemedicine specialty referral were 2.3 (95% CI 1.4, 3.8) times more likely to receive an ear/hearing
diagnosis than those receiving the standard referral of a letter home. Success of the clinic-based intervention
varied substantially between communities; stakeholder interviews revealed implementation challenges that could
be addressed by delivering telehealth directly in schools. The current proposal will establish a unique model of
care in Tribal and non-Tribal regions across the state, bringing virtual specialty care directly into schools. Three
accomplished and complementary multi-PIs, who collaborated on PCORI- and NIDCD-funded studies in rural
Alaska, will lead an interdisciplinary team, and an Alaska Stakeholder Team that includes Alaska Commissioners
for Education and Health and Social Services will guide study development. In Aim 1, the team will develop and
pilot an implementation protocol for school-based virtual specialty care for hearing loss through focus groups
and interviews with community stakeholders. In Aim 2, they will conduct a stepped wedge, cluster-randomized
implementation trial of virtual specialty care in three representative regions (n=31 schools; 2,008 children). The
primary outcome is proportion of hearing referrals resulting in specialty follow-up within two months of screening
date. The conservative hypothesis, based on PCORI trial data, is that virtual specialty care will improve follow-
up by 100%. In Aim 3, the team will evaluate sustainability of virtual specialty care in Alaska schools through a
policy analysis to assess alignment between health and education sectors, identify policy and practice barriers
and accelerators, and ascertain payment models for future programmatic financing. This school-based telehealth
model to address preventable childhood hearing loss could be translated to other underserved rural and minority
groups, bringing high-value services into rural schools to alter the paradigm of prevention nationwide."
10894857,"The discovery that the host immune system can be harnessed to attack solid tumors and improve overall
survival for patients has been transformative. However, only certain tumors are responsive to immune
checkpoint blockade, and an unpredictable fraction maintain durable remissions. In addition, similarly
unpredictable toxicity can manifest with diverse autoimmune attack of normal tissue. Beyond PD-L1 staining
and mutational burden, we have limited biomarkers of response, and we have no predictors of autoimmune
toxicities. Recent studies have highlighted the contribution of the intestinal microbiota to successful PD-1/PD-
L1 and CTLA-4 antibody blockade. There is, however, no consensus as to which microbes promote effective
anti-tumor immune responses, and we lack an understanding of the mechanisms involved. In our proposed
studies, we will seek to identify human gut-associated bacterial species and products that enhance control of
lung adenocarcinoma growth following anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. We will then characterize the host cellular
and molecular targets of the bacteria and their products. In preliminary studies, we identified a strain of
Bacteroides vulgatus that promotes autoimmune disease and also restricts growth of implanted lung cancer
cells in anti-PD-1-treated mice. This tumor model will be used to assess the immune-potentiating roles of B.
vulgatus genes, such as those involved in synthesis of capsular polysaccharides and Lipid A, and to screen
bacterial libraries prepared from patient super-responders, to identify species and consortia that are most
effective at supporting inhibition of tumor growth. We have also developed an autochthonous lung cancer
model in which neoantigens accumulate due to targeting of the mismatch repair machinery, and we will assess
the ability of the candidate microbes to function in a therapeutic mode, after growth of the spontaneous tumors
is established. We will then characterize differences in metabolites and proteins within lymph draining the
intestine of mice colonized with immunotherapy-potentiating or control microbes, and candidate molecules will
be evaluated for their activity in the tumor models. Lastly, we will seek to identify the innate signaling pathways
and the relevant host target cells that convey microbial signals to the tumor microenvironment, thus enhancing
immune control of tumor growth following anti-PD-1 administration. Since tumor cell killing is mediated by
cytotoxic T cells, we will also determine if there are shared antigenic specificities between tumors and the
microbiota. These studies will be complemented by spatial transcriptomic analyses of tumor
microenvironments from mice with and without immunotherapy-potentiating microbiota. Serum from responder
and non-responder lung cancer patients will be evaluated for the presence of microbiome-dependent products
identified in the mouse model and tumor tissue specimens will be subjected to spatial transcriptomics analysis
to determine if there are features shared with tumors in mice. Together, these studies can provide insights for
designing rational strategies to utilize microbiota for potentiation of immune checkpoint blockade in cancer."
10844625,"PROPOSAL SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The US opioid crisis has had a significant effect on many populations, not the least of which effected are
perinatal women. The prevalence of opioid use disorder (OUD) among women giving birth in hospitals increased
by 131% from 2010-2017. OUD in pregnancy and postpartum increases the risks for a host of medical
complications and can lead to adverse birth outcomes including preterm delivery and intrauterine fetal demise,
as well as maternal morbidity and mortality. Loneliness and social isolation are also linked to poorer progression
of acute, chronic, physical, and mental conditions, as well as mortality, and are compounded during the perinatal
period (which is defined as pregnancy and the first postpartum year). Both loneliness and social isolation have
been linked to increased opioid use amount, relapse rates, and overdose even when controlling for OUD
treatment, employment, relationship status, and depression.
 To address both loneliness and engagement in perinatal and OUD care among perinatal women, we plan
to adapt an existing texting support chatbot, Penny, to make it appropriate for use by women who are pregnant
and postpartum and dealing with OUD. The newly adapted chatbot, Penny COPILOT, will allow for two way
short message service (SMS) messaging using natural language processing to respond appropriately and
accurately to user generated input. In this way, Penny COPILOT feels like texting a friend, as it responds using
real sentences and minimizes awkward confirmatory messages. Our team, in collaboration with the Penn Mixed
Methods Research Lab (MMRL) and Memora Health Technology Company, will use intervention mapping guided
by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Science. We will conduct a needs assessment, assemble
an advisory board, engage in pretesting to ensure safety and refine content, and pilot test the resultant adapted
Penny COPILOT in a sample of 20 perinatal women with OUD to evaluate acceptability, feasibility, and patient
satisfaction. Our goal is to develop and refine an acceptable, feasible, and satisfactory supportive texting chatbot
to promote patient engagement in perinatal and OUD care and decrease perceived loneliness."
10913455,"Candidate. My goal is to become an independent physician-scientist who merges physiology and patient-ori-
ented research methods to personalize care for patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). My training as an
engineer and a doctor in Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine (PCCSM), complemented by research
training in epidemiology, have given me the background necessary to pursue this goal. I propose training activ-
ities that will allow me to personalize treatments for one of the most pressing problems for OSA patients- effec-
tiveness of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Through coursework, externships and mentored expe-
rience in physiologic and patient-oriented research, this training program will build skills and knowledge in 1)
physiologic characterization of OSA, 2) treatment adherence, efficacy and patient-oriented outcomes, 3) conduct
of clinical studies, 4) advanced biostatistics and 5) leading a research program. Executing this program will
bridge current knowledge gaps related to the role of physiologic traits in CPAP effectiveness and set me up for
success as an independent investigator.
Mentors and Environment. I have engaged an exceptional team of mentors with expertise tailored for this
proposal. My primary mentor, Dr. Yaggi, is a national expert in OSA epidemiology and clinical study conduct. My
co-mentors are Dr. Wellman, a pioneer in translational OSA physiology, and Dr. Redeker, a leader in patient-
centered outcomes sleep research. This proposal leverages a wealth of resources across institutions, including
Yale’s Center for Precision Pulmonary Medicine and Clinical Epidemiology Research Center, Centers for Sleep
Medicine, PCCSM Section and Internal Medicine Department. The Sleep Disordered Breathing laboratory led
by Dr. Wellman at Harvard is a renowned OSA physiology center. This environment provides methodologic
expertise, research tools and a venue to conduct cutting-edge patient-oriented research in sleep.
Mentored Research Project. Most patients with OSA who are prescribed the gold-standard therapy, CPAP, are
ineffectively treated. This is due to 1) poor CPAP adherence, 2) high residual apnea in 20% of users (low efficacy)
and 3) inconsistent symptom improvement. To improve CPAP effectiveness, we propose to address novel phys-
iologic targets that cause OSA in each individual: arousability, ventilatory control sensitivity and pharyngeal mus-
cle compensation. Our overall objective is to determine the contribution of these traits to CPAP effectiveness
independently of established biological, psychological and social predictors. This work leverages state-of-the art
sleep study analysis tools and validated measures of the determinants of CPAP effectiveness to create a prag-
matic, prospective cohort (n=267) of OSA patients. This unique dataset will help determine whether physiologic
causes of OSA influence CPAP adherence, efficacy, sleep quality, symptoms, function and quality of life. The
results will inform design and conduct of a randomized clinical trial designed to modify physiologic traits such as
easy arousability to improve CPAP effectiveness and other patient-centered outcomes in OSA patients."
10915031,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT - Implementation Science and Health Systems (IS/HS)
Core
The Implementation Science and Health Systems (IS/HS) Core advances the scientific mission
of CAPS by equipping scientists with the skills and expertise to conduct research that brings
proven-effective interventions to scale in diverse settings. HIV intervention science now
includes a robust toolkit, including biomedical approaches for primary and secondary
prevention, effective behavioral strategies, and interventions to address social-structural
barriers to prevention and care. Unfortunately, many efficacious interventions have not yet
attained their full potential, owing to challenges in meeting the complex needs of vulnerable
communities who experience intersecting and co-occurring health and social conditions and to
inadequate integration of interventions into routine practice across health delivery settings and
systems. The IS/HS Core will build capacity within the Center for AIDS Prevention Studies in
applying implementation frameworks, designs, and strategies to integrate interventions and
services into both traditional and nontraditional settings to ensure service access for the
populations most in need. The Core reflects our belief that achieving optimal and equitable
delivery of HIV services requires research skills that draw on implementation and
dissemination theories, fluency in working within diverse health systems, and a commitment to
address intersecting and co-occurring health and social conditions. To do so, the IS/HS Core
takes an ecological and systems-level lens, focusing on the context of the populations served,
health care delivery settings, and stakeholders who can shape responses. Our work will be
guided by three aims: (1) to stimulate rigorous research to optimize intervention
implementation through a focus on implementation theory and intervention implementation
strategies, adaptation, and refinement; (2) to promote expertise in integrating interventions
within diverse health delivery settings through work to support program integration,
measurement, and data integration; and (3) to build capacity to sustain interventions in diverse
contexts via support for studying policy contexts, partnerships outside of health settings, and
promoting team science. The IS/HS Core will promote CAPS' objectives and the Core aims
through seminars, peer review, consultations, referrals, and town halls addressing critical
research topics. To this foundational mix of offerings, the Core will add novel approaches,
including skills-building workshops, multidisciplinary symposia, conferences, and growing a
multidisciplinary network of collaborators across UCSF, health systems, and community
agencies."
10910114,"Project Summary: Our ultimate goal is to find new ways to improve smooth muscle function in people with
visceral myopathy, a disease defined by profound bowel, bladder and uterine smooth muscle dysfunction.
Bowel dysfunction, called myopathic Chronic Intestinal Pseudo-Obstruction (CIPO), is often treated by
intravenous nutrition. Bladder weakness often requires catheterization. When symptoms start in utero, colon
growth is minimal, causing Megacystis Microcolon Intestinal Hypoperistalsis Syndrome (MMIHS). Only ~20%
of people with MMIHS survive to adulthood. Current treatments may reduce symptoms but are not based on
disease mechanisms. Recent data show that 44% of people with MMIHS/CIPO have heterozygous point
mutations in gamma smooth muscle actin (ACTG2), one of 6 actin isoforms. Actin isoforms have distinct roles
in cells, and while actin is well studied, ACTG2 is barely studied. Myopathy-causing ACTG2 mutations are
spread throughout the actin structure. This suggests variant-specific disease mechanisms that could benefit
from variant-specific therapies. To design such therapies, we need a deep understanding of how individual
variants cause disease. We therefore pursue an integrated strategy, combining biochemical, structural, cellular
and stem cell approaches to determine how ACTG2 mutations cause visceral myopathy. Technical
breakthroughs and extensive preliminary data set the groundwork for success. In Aim 1, we develop new ways
to express recombinant human actin in human cells, without tags and featuring natural post-translational
modifications. This major innovation opens the way to biochemical studies of ACTG2, and should also facilitate
studies of variants of other actin isoforms causing skeletal myopathy, cardiomyopathy, vascular disease,
sensorineural hearing loss, and congenital malformations. Using recombinant ACTG2, we will study the
biochemical-structural properties of disease-causing ACTG2 variants, and their interactions with key Actin-
Binding Proteins (ABPs) that regulate actin assembly. To determine how mutations affect cell biology (Aim 2),
we express wild-type or mutant ACTG2 in human Intestinal Smooth Muscle Cells (hISMC). We selected
hISMC because disease-causing ACTG2 variants might alter interactions with ABPs or depend on cell-type
specific post-translational modifications. Our innovative quantitative image analysis pipeline already revealed
how the most common ACTG2 mutation (R257C) affects the actin cytoskeleton and cell biology. We will now
use this strategy to study other ACTG2 mutations. Some mutations might also cause myopathy by preventing
the MRTF-A transcription factor from entering the nucleus to induce contractile gene expression and smooth
muscle differentiation. To test this hypothesis, we invented a new way to convert human Pluripotent Stem Cells
(hPSCs) to visceral smooth muscle-like cells (Aim 3) and made cell lines expressing disease-causing ACTG2
variants. Our cross-disciplinary, integrated strategy should clarify mechanisms of ACTG2 mutation-induced
visceral myopathy, leading to mutation-specific drug screening strategies and new therapies."
10889075,"ABSTRACT
Gastroparesis is a chronic gastrointestinal motility disorder characterized by delayed gastric emptying, chronic
abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. Its incidence has increased 3-fold in the last decade, which has increased
healthcare costs by 10-fold. It is suggested that immune dysregulation plays a role in the pathophysiology of the
disease; however, the immune cellular mechanisms remain largely unknown, especially in humans. This is
largely in part because of limited knowledge on the types and functions of immune cells present in the human
stomach. This gap in knowledge presents a significant barrier to understanding the cellular mechanisms of
disease, and for the rational design of novel therapeutic strategies. Our preliminary data using mass cytometry
(CyTOF) shows that the human stomach harbors mononuclear phagocyte populations that are more diverse
than previously appreciated. Our studies also point, for the first time, to a disease that affects not only the
stomach muscularis as previously suggested, but also the stomach mucosa. Importantly, mononuclear
phagocytes in the mucosa of gastroparesis patients are dysregulated in numbers and function, which correlates
with delayed stomach emptying. Based on these data, our central hypothesis is that gastroparesis patients
harbor dysregulated mucosa and muscularis mononuclear phagocytes that contribute to the pathophysiology of
the disease. In three specific aims, we propose to resolve the identity and dysregulation of stomach mucosa and
muscularis mononuclear phagocytes in gastroparesis patients at a resolution that has not been done until now.
We will also explore the role of a neuronal peptide in modulating stomach mononuclear phagocyte function
during gastroparesis. To achieve these aims, we will take advantage of approaches that allow for the
identification of mononuclear phagocytes in an unbiased fashion. These approaches will be combined with ex
vivo functional assays and a mouse model of stomach emptying with the goal of unraveling cellular mechanisms
of disease. Our rationale is that by investigating the identity, i.e., phenotype and function, of human stomach
mononuclear phagocytes, we can elucidate the cellular mechanisms underpinning delayed stomach emptying
in gastroparesis. This proposal has the potential to impact the rational design of therapeutic strategies for
gastroparesis."
10913383,"Project Summary – Project 2
A new approach that can overcome resistance to immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) is a major unmet need for
Stage IV melanoma patients. The overall goal of this project is to determine if combined ICI with autophagy
inhibition can address this unmet need. Autophagy is a key resistance mechanism to chemotherapy and targeted
therapy. More recently our work and the work of others has implicated autophagy as a resistance mechanism to
immunotherapy. This raises a number of questions about which is the best approach to target autophagy and in
which cell types is it most critical to target autophagy within the tumor microenvironment. This project will
leverage deep collaborations with emerging biotechnology companies that have developed next generation
chemical lysosomal and non-lysosomal autophagy inhibitors that are headed to the clinic. The following aims will
test our overall hypothesis that lysosomal autophagy inhibition results in focused cellular pathway perturbations
in cancer cells and immune cells that enhance the efficacy of ICI: Specific Aim 1 will determine the mechanism
by which novel clinical grade autophagy inhibitors modulate tumor-immune interactions during ICI, focusing on
effects on myeloid, tumor, T cell, and other immune cell phenotypes. We will compare the ability of each of these
inhibitors to augment combined anti-PD-1 and anti CTLA-4 Ab in clinically relevant mouse models. We will focus
on PPT1, a lysosomal thioesterase that regulates autophagy, and the major molecular target of chloroquine
derivatives, and an exciting new target for cancer drug development. We will utilize our novel conditional Ppt1
KO mouse model, to compare the effects of ICI combined with Ppt1 KO in tumor cells, dendritic cells, and myeloid
cells, and compare genetic inhibition to chemical Ppt1 inhibition on melanoma tumor growth. In Specific Aim 2
will determine changes in immunoprofiles of the TME in patients and preclinical models treated with combined
ICI and autophagy inhibition. We will conduct the LIMIT melanoma trial, an adaptive phase I/II trial of nivolumab
+ HCQ and nivolumab + ipilimumab + HCQ in Stage IV melanoma patients. Novel PET imaging technologies
will be used to track CD8+ T-cells in tumors and correlate CD8+ signal with histological CD8+ analysis and
clinical response. In related pre-clinical mouse studies, we will use unbiased approaches to achieve a
comprehensive view of changes in melanoma tumors treated with ICI and HCQ or ICI and DC661 during early
response and resistance. Impact: Our study will identify the mechanism by which autophagy inhibitors modulate
the TME while providing the preclinical rationale for launching next generation clinical trials using novel
autophagy inhibitors more potent and specific than HCQ in ICI combination regimens. Our clinical trial will provide
valuable safety and clinical activity data that will also guide the development of more potent and specific
autophagy inhibitors."
10913387,"Project Summary – Project 3
There is an unmet need to improve the survival of patients with high-risk Stage II melanoma. Currently, the
treatment for Stage II melanoma is surveillance despite unacceptably high recurrence and mortality rates
observed with surgery alone. The sentinel lymph node (SLN) is the first lymph node drained by a primary tumor
and is not only a target for metastasizing cancer cells but also an immunological sensor of tumor antigens
released by primary cutaneous melanoma. Our preliminary data in a draining lymph node (LN) metastasis model
shows striking increases in myeloid cell populations prior to and during melanoma metastasis to the LN. We
propose that these changes in the LN may compromise its ability to act (i) as a gatekeeper to prevent melanoma
spread via the lymphatics and (ii) as an instructor of antigen-specific T cell immunity capable of controlling local
disease and intervening on hematogenous spread. Thus, our overall hypothesis is that the capacity of the
SLN to protect against locoregional and distant melanoma spread is dependent on its immune health,
which is pliable and determined by the immunostimulatory capacity of lymph node-resident myeloid
cells. In Aim 1, Drs. Karakousis (Clinical co-Project Leader (PL)) and Schuchter (co-Investigator (I)) will conduct
an investigator-initiated Phase II clinical trial of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab in clinical Stage IIB/C melanoma.
Using primary tumors and sentinel LNs (SLN) from both this clinical trial and stage-matched historical cohorts,
we will determine the effects of immunotherapy on the immunophenotype and anti-metastatic capacity of the
SLN. We will use a combination of unbiased global profiling strategies pioneered by Dr. Wherry (co-I) and
hypothesis-driven approaches guided by our discoveries into the role of macrophages in preparing the metastatic
niche (Beatty, Applied co-PL) to determine therapy-associated changes in SLN-positive and -negative patients.
Studies in syngeneic models will then inform the role of myeloid cell subsets in directing changes in LN biology
triggered by melanoma development and their impact on anti-PD1 therapy. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that
the immunostimulatory capacity of lymph node dendritic cells determines the likelihood of response to anti-PD1
therapy. Under the leadership of co-PLs Drs. Herlyn and Beatty , we will use multiplex tissue- and cell-based
assays to analyze samples collected from our Phase II trial and stage-matched historical controls with the goal
to define T cell interactions with myeloid cells, including dendritic cells, and their impact on treatment response
and clinical outcomes. In addition, we will determine if clinically-available TLR agonists can enhance the
immunostimulatory capacity of the draining LN and in doing so, improve the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy using
humanized mice challenged with patient-derived xenografts which model early stage melanoma with high fidelity.
Impact: We anticipate neoadjuvant immunotherapy will substantially reduce SLN positivity rates warranting future
randomized studies designed to change clinical practice. We expect to identify the SLN as an important
determinant of melanoma pathogenesis and clinical outcomes to immunotherapy."
10913392,"Project Summary – Developmental Research Program
In the previous cycle, the Wistar/UPenn SPORE Development Research Program (DRP) was led by Dr. Robert
Vonderheide, who has since become the Cancer Center Director of the Abramson Cancer Center. The DRP
recruited a diverse array of investigators from many fields into melanoma and skin cancer research. The result
has been an outstanding number of high impact papers, extramural grants, and two projects graduating from the
DRP into full projects in this application. Building on this success, Dr. Meenhard Herlyn and Dr. Ravi Amaravadi,
the co-Directors of this SPORE grant will serve as DRP co-Directors in the new cycle. The overall goals of the
DRP in the new grant period remain to advance high quality research, foster new ideas, and move research
studies from pilot to project status. A second goal of the DRP is to create opportunities for the scientific
development of junior faculty or senior investigators who are interested in transitioning into skin cancer research.
Our approach is summarized in 2 specific aims and is enabled by a strong commitment for an exceptional level
of institutional support from The Wistar Institute and UPenn. The DRP will, in particular, welcome projects on
non-melanoma skin cancers and topics not covered by the funded full Projects. Aim 1 is to attract, select and
fund the most outstanding proposals with significant potential to benefit the Skin Cancer SPORE and
translational skin cancer research. Specific research projects are summarized that represent all cancers of the
skin. Aim 2 is to support and integrate the selected pilot projects into the SPORE program with established
processes to review and monitor progress. Women and underrepresented minorities will be strongly encouraged
to participate. The DRP has a transparent peer-reviewed selection process that incorporates defined criteria for
funding decisions. We require that DRP awardees be active in SPORE functions, use the SPORE Core resource,
and provide formal written progress reports. Within the context of the DRP, we have established high standards
and expectations of the investigators and have established a formal process to review and monitor progress of
funded pilot projects. The Program measures success by publications, extramural funding, stimulating new aims
in existing SPORE Projects, and elevation to full projects for the future."
10913394,"Project Summary – Career Enhancement Program
The goal of the Career Enhancement Program (CEP) is to recruit, train and retain a diverse pool of outstanding
early-career investigators who are committed to pursuing translational skin cancer research. The CEP will be led
by two established investigators with complementary expertise in basic (Dr. Villanueva) and clinical (Dr.
Schuchter) melanoma research. Both co-Directors are committed to training and mentoring of translational
investigators and have an established record of recruiting and supporting women and minorities. The CEP will
primarily assist junior faculty in their career development, but more established investigators interested in
refocusing their research efforts on melanoma/skin cancer could also be considered. Women and
underrepresented minorities will be strongly encouraged to participate. Likewise, projects aimed at addressing
health disparities and/or skin cancer subtypes more common in underrepresented minorities will be encouraged
and given special consideration. A team of clinicians, educators and researchers with broad expertise in
translational research will ensure implementation of the specific aims of this program. With the support of the
University of Pennsylvania, the Abramson Cancer Center and The Wistar Institute, the CEP will provide junior
faculty the resources and guidance needed to establish innovative and fully funded independent skin cancer
research programs and become future academic leaders. The CEP will provide awardees with two years of
financial support for translational research projects in skin cancer with potential promotion to full SPORE projects
or independent grant support. Awardees are required to actively participate in SPORE functions, use the SPORE
Core resources, and provide both formal written progress reports and oral presentations. We have established
high standards and expectations for the research mentors and a formalized program of long-term awardee
mentorship. The program measures success by resulting publications, funding, and ultimately career
advancement and national recognition. We have an outstanding talent pool of candidates and an effective
training and mentorship program that will result in an exceptional group of skin cancer researchers. Our SPORE
CEP has had an outstanding record recruiting and training investigators for careers in translational skin cancer research.
Our past CEP awardees have published 74 papers during the past cycle and have been highly successful in obtaining
peer reviewed funding from NCI and/or other funding agencies. In addition, all past awardees have transitioned from
young investigators into leading academic positions and remain in the skin cancer field."
10911857,"TITLE: Biotechnology Resource Center of BioModular Multi-scale Systems (CBM2) for Precision Medicine
Training and Dissemination: Sense-of-Scale: The use of mixed-scale systems for rare biomarker analysis
Abstract/Summary
The Center of BioModular Multi-Scale Systems for Precision Medicine (CBM2) seeks to develop innovative
mixed-scale tools for the analysis of liquid biopsy markers that aid in managing patients' diseases by identifying
appropriate clinical treatment strategies that benefit patients guided by the molecular composition of their
disease. This approach, known as ”Precision Medicine,” will be the focus of the Center's Training and
Dissemination (T&D) efforts by leveraging the compelling research taking place under the umbrella of the
Center's Technology Research and Development (TR&D) projects. The Center will participate in training and
educating patrons (i.e., non-Center affiliated researchers, collaborators, students, physicians, and potential
industry partners) on Center technologies, “How to Make It”, and “How to Use It.” Findings and discoveries
stemming from the TR&Ds will be efficiently disseminated into the scientific community and to physicians
involved in clinical research. CBM2 will take advantage of existing resources within the Center's affiliated
institutions (KU, UNC, and LSU) to familiarize the biomedical community with its extensive capabilities; an
example includes state-of-the-art nanofabrication resources located at all three campuses. Dissemination of
Center discoveries will be enhanced by compelling publications, patents, and the formation of startups around
Center IP. The Center will educate a non-scientific community on the subject of Precision Medicine and the
benefits it offers in terms of the improvement of patient care and disease management. Dissemination will follow
traditional routes and those not so traditional, such as publications and presentations at national/international
meetings as well as a robust website, social media, and online instructional videos. Our visiting scholar program
to engage non-affiliated researchers in the Center's TR&D projects will facilitate dissemination.
The common theme of the Center's T&D efforts will be, “Sense-of-Scale: the use of mixed-scale systems for rare
biomarker analysis”. CBM2's objectives in training will be to convey the message that biological systems (i.e.,
liquid biopsy markers such as cfDNA, miRNA, proteins, EVs, and cells) span many sizes and that biotechnology
research frequently involves experiments that must link different biological length scales together to realize the
delivery of effective integrated systems for their analysis. Training efforts will involve discussions on defining
research areas based on the characteristic size of the biological system of interest and time-scales of relevant
phenomena (i.e., reactions, separations, diffusion) under investigation. T&D events will seek to answer questions
related to differences between processes that take place in a micro- and nano-scale environment. How does
biology differ when executed below tens of micrometers or nanometers? Can these processes be modeled?
How can observables in different length scales be used for designing fluidic systems with different sizes? Hands-
on experiments will be designed that will convey to parties the size of cells, EVs, and DNA and how devices can
be developed to analyze them."
10843884,"PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT
Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is the most lethal state of prostate cancer (PCa) and
remains as the most challenging issue in PCa treatment. The development of more effective treatments for
mCRPC is a significant unmet clinical need. There are substantial heterogeneities in treatment responses of
mCRPC, necessitating the use of more personalized strategies in guiding treatment based on the specific
genomic characteristics of individual patients. There are considerable limitations in using the traditional tissue-
based genomic profiling to guide mCRPC treatment, partly because mCRPC is a bone-predominant metastatic
disease, thus tissue samples are difficult to obtain and yields are generally low. Moreover, during treatments,
the genomic profiles of tumors may change quickly to evade therapeutic or immune attacks, leading to drug
resistance. In order to promptly and accurately capture these changes and adjust treatment plans, repeated
tumor biopsies would be needed, which is difficult to perform in routine clinical practices given the invasive and
bone-predominant nature of mCRPC. Therefore, in order to improve mCRPC prognosis, it is highly important
to develop novel, non-invasive liquid biopsy approaches to real-time monitor treatment response and guide the
use of different treatments. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are shed from tumors into blood and have extremely
high malignant potential, and are arguably the most important subset of tumor cells to monitor and treat. CTCs
can be non-invasively and repeatedly enumerated in real-time, and have exhibited promising prognostic
potentials, as evidenced by the FDA-approval of the CellSearch platform for CTC enumerations as an
independent prognostic factor of several metastatic cancers including mCRPC. However, national guidelines
have not unanimously endorsed the use of CTC enumeration in routine clinical practices, mostly because it
remains unclear what actions should be taken for high-risk patients with elevated CTCs. These facts highlight
the importance of moving beyond CTC enumeration and towards in-depth genomic characterizations of CTCs.
Large studies on single-cell CTC analysis have been rarely reported, partly due to the significant challenges on
single-CTC detection, isolation, whole genome amplification (WGA), and sequencing bias identification and
correction. We have established a comprehensive pipeline on the enrichment, enumeration, isolation, WGA,
sequencing, and data analysis of single CTCs. Based on three PCa patient cohorts at the Sidney Kimmel
Cancer Center, MD Anderson Cancer Center, and George Washington University Cancer Center, we will
conduct genomic profiling of single CTCs to identify markers of treatment response and prognosis. To our best
knowledge, this is the first large population-based study of single-CTC analysis in mCRPC. Findings from this
study will significantly improve the potential of the clinical application of CTCs in mCRPC management, by
precisely tailoring treatment to the genomic make-up of individual CTCs from individual patients."

 Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a grade IV glioma, is the most malignant form of an
astrocytoma and is the most common malignant brain tumor in adults. The cause of this primary
and highly aggressive cancer is unclear. The current treatment for glioblastoma is limited to
maximal safe surgical resection, followed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Unfortunately,
virtually all patients will have tumor recurrence and die of this disease. While survival without
treatment is approximately three months, survival following treatment is only 12 to 15 months.
Less than 5% of people survive longer than five years.
 A cardinal metabolic characteristic of tumorigenesis is a metabolic shift in which glycolysis,
even in the presence of adequate tissue oxygen, increases disproportionately relative to oxidative
phosphorylation (OXPHOS), a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect. This glycolytic shift
occurs in GBM and is mechanistically associated with post-translational inhibition of the
mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), which normally catalyzes the rate-limiting
step in the aerobic oxidation of glucose-derived pyruvate and lactate. PDC inhibition is due to
transcriptional upregulation of one or more of four pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoforms (PDK
1-4) that inhibit PDC by reversible phosphorylation. Dichloroacetate (DCA), the prototypic PDK
inhibitor, readily crosses the blood-brain barrier and represents an entirely new class of small
molecule metabolic modulators that act in mitochondria to reset cellular homeostasis in various
congenital and acquired metabolic disorders. Indeed, pharmacological inhibition of PDK in cancer
cells by DCA restores PDC activity, reverses the Warburg effect and induces a caspase-mediated
selective apoptosis of tumors. Extensive pre-clinical research and early clinical trials in patients
with recurrent GBM and other brain tumors indicate that DCA may be a safe and uniquely effective
metabolic therapy for GBM.
DCA inhibits its own metabolism and its only clinically limiting toxicity is reversible peripheral
neuropathy. To mitigate this adverse effect, we developed and validated a genotyping method
for genetics-based dosing of DCA that dichotomizes subjects into fast and slow drug
metabolizers, leading to safe, personalized DCA dosing."

Narcotic use in pain management of underserved minority populations and minority United States veterans has
played a major role in the ongoing opioid crisis. According to the NIH, veterans are more susceptible to opioid
addiction and are 40% more likely to suffer from severe chronic joint pain then non-veterans. Over the next
decade, the percentage of minority veterans will increase from 23% to 34% and is expected to rise. This shift of
racial and ethnic minorities directly correlates to the growing demographics of minority active-duty soldiers that
make up over 40% of our nation’s military forces. The federal government considers the 18.2 million veteran and
42 million non-veteran minority Americans to be ""potentially vulnerable patient populations” with health disparities
particularly related to joint diseases care. Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common of these joint diseases
affecting the entire US population, and of considerably higher 19-fold incidence and prevalence in the service-
disabled veteran population. Although the disease itself does not appear to occur more frequently in minorities,
its effects and progression are more severe. This is especially true among minorities with arthritis, 36.7% of
Black patients and 35.5% of Hispanic patients reported severe joint pain compared to only 23.0% of non-Hispanic
Whites. The economic burden of veterans with OA is estimated to approach or exceed $60 billion annually due
to longer life expectancies. Arthritis is also a significant economic and health burden in the United States at large
which is estimated to exceed $394 billion in healthcare costs by 2030. In our SBIR HEAL Phase I, we developed
a wireless long-duration low-intensity ultrasound NSAID-enhanced (2.5% diclofenac) sonophoresis system for
use by the underserved OA population. We first demonstrated that the sonophoresis technology could increase
tissue penetration of NSAIDs by 3.8x compared to standard of care (p<0.01). Secondly, the miniature device
was evaluated in a 25-subject human-factors study, 54-subject diathermy study and a 52-subject OA clinical
study on patients with radiographically confirmed mild to moderate knee OA. In 8-weeks of daily 4-hour use,
symptomatic pain was significantly reduced by 3.43 point (55%) NRS (n=34, p<0.0001) versus 1.00 point (22%)
NRS (n=18, p=0.0847) for subjects treated with topical diclofenac pain cream. Over 98% of the study population
found the device easy to use and would continue treatment for their knee OA symptoms. For this Phase II HEAL
renewal application (1) First ZetrOZ Systems will refine the design and optimize the wireless sonophoresis
technology for shelf-life stability and device functionality/usability by the veteran and aging population. A series
of regulatory testing standards including sensitization, cytotoxicity, packaging/formulation stability,
biocompatibility, microbial growth, shelf-life and home-use will be completed on the wireless sonophoresis
system. Additionally, a porcine animal model with histopathology and pharmacokinetics will be completed to
verify the safety profile of the technology. (2) ZetrOZ Systems will complete a 24-week, 3-arm, multi-site,
placebo-controlled, randomized, efficacy study to expand upon our Phase I study by examining the health
benefits and commerciality of the sonophoresis technology in 300 patients enrolled at three ethnically diverse
locations. The primary outcome of the study will be pain score, evaluated daily using the numerical rating scale
(NRS). Baseline NRS score will include the first two weeks of the study without intervention. The intervention
phase will separate three demographically equivalent groups of 100, assigned to use either the
medicated/unmedicated sonophoresis technology or standard 2.5% diclofenac topical cream daily self-applied
for 24 weeks. The proposed combination therapy has the potential to deliver a safe, effective, and conservative
treatment approach for OA across the minority, veteran, and aging populations."

This research program focuses on tRNA biology and its subcellular trafficking. tRNAs are small noncoding RNAs
that are essential for decoding the genome by delivering amino acids to translating ribosomes according to codon
directions in mRNAs. Defects in tRNA biology cause numerous human disorders from metabolic diseases, to
neuromuscular diseases, and to cancer. tRNA biology requires a complex set of conserved gene products for
post-transcriptional processing, subcellular traffic, and intron turnover. We employ budding yeast and in vivo
technologies to discover unknown important aspects of tRNA biology. In Aim 1 of this proposal we will study
tRNA nuclear export. It is not completely understood how tRNAs that are transcribed and partially processed in
the nucleus are exported to the cytoplasm for their iterative function in translation. One pathway utilizes the
conserved b-importin Los1/Exportin that is dedicated to tRNA nuclear export, but it is unessential in all tested
organisms. Employing an unbiased genome-wide screen for gene products involved in tRNA biology, we
discovered three additional gene products that export tRNA to the cytoplasm: the heterodimer, Mex67-Mtr2 and
Crm1. However, Mex67-Mtr2 and Crm1 are not dedicated to tRNA and they have major roles in mRNA and
protein nuclear export. Thus, it is not understood how they recognize tRNAs. Moreover, Mex67-Mtr2 appears to
be error-prone, delivering tRNA to the cytoplasm prior to removal of leader/trailer sequences. We will identify
adapters needed to complex Mex67-Mtr2 and Crm1 with tRNAs and learn how mistakes by the error-prone
exporters are dealt with. In Aim2 of this proposal we will study trafficking of tRNAs between the nucleus and the
cytoplasm. Although for decades it was thought that tRNA movement is unidirectional, nucleus to cytoplasm, we
co-discovered that tRNAs move bi-directionally between the nucleus and the cytoplasm and that the dynamics
are conserved between yeast and vertebrate cells. We developed a new methodology, the HCl/aniline assay,
that reports tRNA retrograde nuclear import and re-export to the cytoplasm. We will employ this methodology to
characterize the gene products that function in the tRNA retrograde pathway and assess whether tRNA
retrograde traffic is iterative. Aim 3 addresses tRNA introns. Possession of tRNA introns in subsets of tRNA
genes is conserved from Archaea to humans. Although the mechanism to remove introns from pre-tRNAs is
understood, the fate and function of tRNA introns is largely mysterious. We discovered one mechanism for tRNA
intron turnover; however, there are at least four additional unknown mechanisms to destroy tRNA introns which
we propose to characterize. Surprisingly, we also learned that under particular stresses, tRNA introns
accumulate to high levels. Furthermore, tRNA introns contain long stretches of complementarity to mRNAs. Our
preliminary data support the hypothesis that they regulate gene express through complementary base paring
with mRNAs; we will test this hypothesis in Aim 3. Thus, the proposed research program impacts upon multiple
facets of gene expression, quality control, and issues important to human health."
10903878,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Diabetes is a major public health problem in Latino(a)s. There are escalating numbers of Latino(a)s
diagnosed with diabetes and at disproportionate rates compared to other ethnicities. Numerous interventions
have been initiated to improve minority healthcare including diabetes group visits, which have been valuable in
improving education and glycemic control. In our group visit investigations, we initiated Community Health
Workers (CHWs)—local community members who serve as culturally-sensitive patient liaisons to the healthcare
system—as part of the multidisciplinary team. We demonstrated that CHWs are vital team members and
particularly helpful in identifying medication-access barriers. However, CHWs are frontline workers and often
left unsupported and poorly supervised. We used these data to pioneer the combination of four diabetes
interventions in our TIME trial (Telehealth-supported, Integrated CHWs, Medication-access, group visit
Education). The TIME trial showed that individuals randomized to TIME significantly improved glycemic control,
blood pressure and adherence to American Diabetes Association standards compared to usual care. The study
also showed that telehealth (mobile health (mHealth) and ZOOM video conferencing) was instrumental in
supporting CHWs in their work and enhancing their communication with patients.
 The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the expansive use of telehealth and its ability to improve
healthcare. It has also underscored the pressing need to improve care for low-income minorities. Though
diabetes programs are valuable in improving education and clinical outcomes, they are often difficult to initiate
in low-income settings. Pragmatic implementation using telehealth to mentor local clinic teams of providers and
CHWs is promising to address these barriers. We have pilot data showing the feasibility of telementoring a local
clinic to initiate TIME that has resulted in improved HbA1c levels but we now need to test it within a larger sample.
In the proposed study we will evaluate this approach in a randomized clinical trial (N=250; intervention=125) of
low-income, adult Latino(a)s with type 2 diabetes randomized to TIME (intervention) versus usual care enhanced
with education (EUC). Our research group will provide telementoring to local clinic teams to initiate TIME into
their clinics. To evaluate efficacy, we will compare TIME versus EUC clinical changes including HbA1c (primary
outcome), blood pressure, cholesterol, and body mass index from baseline to 12-months (AIM 1). To compare
longitudinal data of study arms, we will follow these clinical measures until 36 months (AIM 2). We will also
provide TIME program acceptability and evaluation data for participants and clinic teams from baseline to 12-
months (AIM 3). We hypothesize that TIME participants will have superior and more sustainable clinical
outcomes compared to EUC individuals and that the intervention will have high levels of acceptability and
evaluation data. We anticipate that the proposed study will provide justification of telementoring to initiate TIME
and strong evidence to improve the longitudinal care of low-income Latino(a)s with diabetes."

Skin disease affects 1 in 4 Americans and costs $75 billion annually. Diagnosis relies upon visual inspection,
but the subjective nature of visual assessment can lead to death from skin cancer misdiagnosis or suffering
from misdiagnosis of a treatable chronic inflammatory condition. Non-white Americans make up 40% of the
population and face further challenges, because disease can appear more subtly in pigmented skin, leading to
systematic underdiagnosis and undertreatment. Skin biopsy is more objective but not all patients, particularly
children, tolerate invasive procedures, and there are concerns about overutilization and low diagnostic yield of
biopsies. Thus there is an urgent need for objective technologies that can quantitatively assess cutaneous
inflammation and neoplasms across diverse skin types, and that can provide noninvasive alternatives to skin
biopsy. Macroscopic optical imaging modalities may be able to address this need, but mostly depend on
Silicon(Si)-based photodetectors, which constrains what these devices can measure because in the range
where Si-based detectors are most sensitive (400-950 nm), melanin and hemoglobin are the dominant
chromophores, while lipid and water are essentially invisible. With respect to microscopic optical imaging
modalities, reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) provides an alternative to biopsy. However, conventional
RCM is limited to depths of 200-350 µm, and therefore deeper lesion margins may be missed and disease
processes that extend beyond the epidermis are inaccessible. The short wave infrared (SWIR) spectral range
(900-1700 nm) extends beyond the reach of Si-based detectors, and is characterized by increased water and
lipid absorption, and decreased melanin absorption. In recent work we found that noninvasive SWIR imaging
provides high contrast visualization of cutaneous inflammation that can be used to derive quantitative
measures of inflammation that decrease linearly with disease progression. These considerations inform the
central hypothesis that SWIR imaging will support objective assessment of inflammatory and neoplastic skin
diseases regardless of skin pigmentation. In Aim 1 we will develop a macroscopic SWIR imaging modality and
test its ability to assess disease severity in representative chronic inflammatory conditions in patients with
diverse skin types. In Aim 2 we will develop a microscopic SWIR imaging modality and test its ability to surpass
existing optical imaging depth limitations and also to differentiate benign from malignant lesions. These aims
will be achieved through technical expertise in the Shmuylovich lab, with preclinical validation in skin mimicking
phantoms followed by pilot studies in human subjects. This work represents a paradigm shift in cutaneous
imaging whereby novel research-grade infrared imaging will be clinically translated to quantitatively assess
disease across the full spectrum of diverse skin types, and at length scales ranging from whole body
photography to virtual histology. These new technologies will have the potential to provide all patients with
access to accurate diagnosis and management of skin disease and improve treatment outcomes."
10897226,"Abstract: In today's microbiome era, it is well-recognized that dental caries, one of the most prevalent and costly
chronic infectious diseases world-wide, results from dysbiosis of the oral microbiota and the oral environmental
changes that cause tooth damage. Specifically, frequent intake of fermentable carbohydrates promotes a
progressive shift in microbial composition toward acidogenic and acid-tolerant species. The continual acid-
induced demineralization eventually overcomes the buffering capacity and anti-microbial properties of saliva,
leading to irreversible tooth destruction. The goal of this proposed research is to prevent dental caries through
targeted treatment of acid-producing bacteria (t-TAB). t-TAB will promote a healthy microbial community that is
vital for modulating pH and preventing acid-induced teeth damage. The t-TAB will be achieved by selectively
inhibiting the growth of cariogenic bacteria through enhanced antimicrobial (AM) efficacy in response to the
accelerated acid production by these bacteria in comparison to commensal species. We propose four specific
aims to develop, identify and assess effective t-TAB candidates. In Specific Aim 1, we will synthesize and
characterize six new pH-sensitive quaternary pyridinium salts (pH-QPSs). We expect to identify compounds or
combinations of compounds that provide t-TAB in aqueous mixtures. We will enhance our understanding of the
chemical structure/AM efficacy relationship and optimize the AM efficacy and solubility of pH-QPS(s) to obtain
safe and effective t-TAB treatments. In Specific Aim 2, we will transform a clinically tested AM agent,
chlorhexidine (CHX), into a t-TAB agent which provides pH-responsive AM efficacy. We will achieve acid
enhanced CHX release through encapsulated CHX in QPS-functionalized mesoporous silica nanoparticles. We
will also identify the synergistic pH-AM-E induced by interactions of CHX and pH-QPSs. In Specific Aim 3, we
will assess and compare the t-TAB efficacy of lead candidates from Aim 1 and Aim 2 by employing a multispecies
biofilm model that simulates human oral microbial community (named O-mix). The t-TAB efficacy will be
assessed in the presence and absence of sucrose—the cariogenic dietary carbohydrate. Strategy will entail
evaluating biomass, analyzing microbial profiles and determining environmental pH. Finally, the most effective
t-TAB candidates that successfully inhibit the growth of cariogenic acid-producing bacteria without affecting the
functions of commensal species will be further assessed in Specific Aim 4 in vitro using a microbial-caries model
on human enamel and in vivo employing a well-developed mouse caries model. Successful completion of the
proposed aims will provide new materials for oral rinse in dental clinics to prevent/treat dental caries. Knowledge
gained from this study will also advance material development to prevent infection and erosion."

Title: Tracing and targeting the epigenetic heterogeneity in breast cancer metastasis.
Metastasis is major cause of cancer-related death and is the most challenging to treat. Besides the well-studied
genomic mutations in cancer, our understanding of non-genomic alterations remains limited. The proposed
approach is to dissect the mechanisms of non-genomic intra-metastasis heterogeneity in breast cancer.
Recently, we demonstrated that osteoblasts (bone forming cells) promote a global alteration of chromatin
organization which associates with increased stemness, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, and
overexpression of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases included FGFR1 and PDGFRβ. Ultimately, estrogen
signaling was inhibited while endocrine resistance was increased. Mechanistically, we identified FGF2/PDBFβ/
EZH2 axis as a novel regulator of epigenetic reprogramming in breast cancer bone metastasis. However, several
outstanding questions remained unanswered: (i) what mechanisms drive phenotypic variations between
neighboring cells in bone metastasis, (ii) are epigenetic traits inheritable during metastasis progression, and (ii)
if yes, how do they influence therapeutic response? In this project, our goal is to understand the mechanisms of
intra-tumor heterogeneity in bone metastases and determine how epigenetic heterogeneity affects therapeutic
response beyond the genetic heterogeneity that has been extensively studied. We aim to trace and dissect the
epigenetic intra-tumor heterogeneity (eITH) using a cutting-edge barcoding strategy (K99 phase), identify
epigenetic modulators by integrating single cell multi-omics (K99-R00 phase), test new therapeutic approaches
and eventually expand our findings to other breast cancer metastasis sites (R00 phase) including lung, liver, and
brain. Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) is an internationally renowned institution for breast cancer research,
which gives me the opportunity to closely interact, exchange ideas, and share my findings with leading scientists,
clinicians and patient advocates. For my career transition, I assembled a team of senior scientists and experts
including my mentor, Professor Xiang H-F Zhang, who is well-established in breast cancer bone metastasis. My
co-mentor, Professor Jeffrey Rosen, is a distinguished scientist in mammary gland development and breast
cancer modeling. Because of the clinical relevance of the project, I also included Professor C. Kent Osborne,
founding director of the Dan L. Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center (DLDCCC), Professor Matthew J. Ellis,
a world-renowned oncologist and director of the Breast Center, Dr. Bora Lim, an expert in aggressive subtypes
of breast cancer (e.g. inflammatory breast cancer), Professor Susan G. Hilsenbeck, a distinguished
biostatistician, and Dr. Zhandong Liu a computational biologist and statistician with expertise in single cell
analysis. Adding the expertise of my advisory team to the rich intellectual resource and cutting-edge technology
available at BCM will facilitate my successful transition into an independent position at a top research institution."

The Biostatistics and Computational Analysis Core (BCAC) is a critical supporting core for the
proposed project. The BCAC will work closely with all project investigators to meet their
bioinformatic, statistical, and data science needs. By making data Findable, Accessible,
Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR), the BCAC will maximize the impact and optimize the path to
identifying high impact insights on the initial steps of the induction of bNAb precursors, and help
to address the knowledge gap whether vaccine adjuvant-induced innate responses impact bNAb
precursor development and affinity maturation which are expected to inform the development of
new targeted immunomodulatory approaches for HIV vaccine design.
The program will generate a suite of longitudinal data with a broad data types, including
transcriptomics, single cell (sc) RNA-sequencing, immunome analysis by CyTOF, proteome
analysis of soluble immune mediators in plasma, and bacterial presence/abundance in the gut.
Such rich data provides unprecedented opportunities to gain insights into innate responses, but
also creates analytically challenges to dissect underlying mechanisms of bNAb precursor
development, which are intricate with many factors interweaving with each other and jointly
impacting bNAb precursor development. The BCAC investigators are recognized experts in
biostatistics, data integration across multi-omics, and HIV research, which allows them to address
the challenges by providing state-of-the art expertise in a wide range of data science fields. The
core will ensure effective data management and data integration. More importantly, the core will
develop a suite of innovative approaches to integrate longitudinal immune, microbiome, and
molecular signatures to predict the development of bNAb precursors. The sum of the combined
results of Projects and Cores provided by the BACA in this Program will be greater than data
output that could be achieved by each Program component alone. By integrating the data
obtained in Project 1 with microbial signatures identified in Project 2, we expect to make more
precise prediction on bNAb precursor development, as defined by the B Cell Core."
10852987,"ABSTRACT - PROJECT 1
The induction of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAb) by HIV vaccination remains a major challenge. Rational
B-cell-lineage vaccine design with native HIV envelope trimers has emerged as the most promising vaccine
strategy. Yet, while HIV Env glycoprotein trimers targeting the respective germline B cell receptor have been
successful in inducing autologous tier 2 neutralizing antibodies by vaccination, the induction of antibodies able
to neutralize heterologous strains remains limited. Numerous studies have reported that vaccine-induced
antibody responses can be enhanced by the inclusion of adjuvants in the vaccine regimen. The potential of
adjuvants to impact the induction of bNAb, however, is largely unexplored. The long-term goal of Project 1 is to
identify mechanisms by which adjuvants can enhance the induction and maturation of bNAbs. We present
preliminary data that immunization of infant rhesus macaques (RM) with the germline targeting BG505 GT1.1
SOSIP mixed with the TLR7,8-based adjuvant 3M-052 in stable emulsion (SE) resulted in the induction of bNAb
precursors against the CD4 binding site (CD4bs), indicative of VRC01-like bNAbs, in 3 of 5 animals by 1.5 years.
Studies in adult RM have reported that the inclusion of 3M-052 in HIV vaccine regimens promotes the induction
of long-lived plasma cells, and HIV vaccines with TLR3- or TLR4-based adjuvants in germline BCR knock-in
mice have been associated with increased somatic hypermutation (SHM) and the induction of VRC01-like bNAb
precursors. However, the mechanisms by which 3M-052 or other TLR-based adjuvants support germinal center
activity, SHM, the induction of HIV bNAb precursors, and/or the development of long-lived plasma cells remain
unknown. The objective of Project 1 is to identify the determinants of the initial steps in the induction of bNAb
precursors. We hypothesize that adjuvants given in combination with BG505 GT1.1 SOSIP trimers alter the
developmental pathway of Env-specific B cells through the induction of specific innate responses that will impact
affinity maturation of bNAb precursors. Understanding the complex process of B cell development towards bNAb-
producing B cells in response to HIV vaccination and its regulation will require broad omics-based approaches
that this Program will apply. Project 1 will thoroughly assess innate immune responses via transcriptomics, single
cell (sc) RNA-sequencing, immunome analysis by CyTOF, and proteome analysis of soluble immune mediators
in plasma. To determine whether bNAb development can be impacted by the choice of adjuvant, we will ask
whether the yield of bNAb precursors after BG505 GT1.1 SOSIP immunization differs dependent on innate
responses induced by 3M-052-SE versus a saponin-based adjuvant (Aim 1), and dependent on adjuvant-
specific immune cell activation and function in lymph nodes (Aim 2). In collaboration with Project 2, we will define
how these innate responses are modulated by commensal bacteria (Aim 3). The results are expected to inform
the development of new targeted immunomodulatory approaches of the vaccine prime to optimize the induction
of bNAb precursors and provide a framework for bNAb-targeting HIV vaccine evaluation and down-selection."
10852992,"Abstract – Project 2
Globally, 600,000 young adults become infected with HIV-1 each year. Therefore, there is an urgent need to
develop an early life vaccine strategy that protects young adults from HIV infection. This early life vaccine should
elicit protective broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs), which have been shown to be effective against infection
in nonhuman primates and humans. Newer, rationally designed native-like HIV envelope trimer-based vaccines
that engage germline B cell receptors and drive evolution of bNAbs have been developed. These B cell lineage-
based vaccines induce bNAb precursors in 50–60% of infant and adult nonhuman primates, and early clinical
trial data suggests some humans also develop bNAbs. While these findings offer significant promise that the
long-standing goal of an effective HIV vaccine is on the horizon, there is a gap in our understanding of the
determinants of bNAb induction that results in only half of vaccinees developing a favorable response. It is now
clear that the microbiome is intricately intertwined with the development and modulation of the immune system,
and that these microbiome–immune interactions are critical for vaccine responses. Our preliminary data confirm
that the microbiome is a necessary and modifiable factor that influences vaccine responses, with specific
bacterial taxa positively associated with antibody titers resulting from immunization with HIV Env-based vaccines.
Thus, Project 2 proposes to define specific microbial features that can be harnessed as an endogenous adjuvant
to help—along with optimal exogenous adjuvants identified by Project 1—drive induction of HIV bNAb
precursors after vaccination with the BG505 GT1.1 SOSIP trimer immunogen. Specifically, Aim 1 of this project
will couple shotgun metagenomic data and microbe–phenotype triangulation, a novel microbiome discovery
platform we developed, to define microbial features that associate with the induction of HIV bNAb precursors.
Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that some commensal bacteria predispose towards beneficial vaccine responses
by helping induce vaccine-elicited antibodies that are cross-reactive with the microbiome. To enhance the
translational potential of our work, we will examine microbiome cross-reactive antibodies in both infant NHPs
and humans. Finally, Aim 3 will develop a gnotobiotic human B cell lineage knock-in mouse model to
experimentally define the role of the microbiome in bNAb precursor induction, including functionally validating
the bioinformatically identified microbial features. Taken together, the results of this Project will elucidate specific
microbes that modulate the immune landscape such that a greater percentage of B cell lineage-based vaccine
recipients develop bNAb precursors. Ultimately, these adjuvant-like microbes can be incorporated into future
vaccine strategies."
10915539,"Summary
 The abuse of opioid drugs is associated with treatment non-compliance, greater risk of viral transmission,
and more rapid clinical progression of HIV disease. The overarching hypothesis behind the present project is
that the analysis of molecular profiles of neuronal and glia cells at the single cell level in drug abuse-relevant
brain regions by single nucleus RNA-Seq (snRNA-Seq) will reveal key genes that are dysregulated by the
interaction of HIV with opioid abuse, resulting in neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. To test the
present hypothesis, we propose to use validated systems biology strategies for the reconstruction and
interrogation of a genome-scale integrated gene regulatory network in conjunction with snRNA-Seq from HIV
transgenic (Tg) rats, which harbor a non-replicating HIV-1 transgene expressing chronic low-levels of multiple
HIV-1 proteins in disease-relevant cell types, and wild-type rats.
 The occasional but limited use of a drug is clinically distinct from dependent drug use, which is
characterized by the emergence of dependence and a negative emotional state when access to the drug is
prevented that drives negative reinforcement, a powerful source of motivation for drug seeking. Therefore, we
will use a state-of-the-art paradigm of voluntary intravenous opioid self-administration under short access
(ShA) conditions, which is characterized by a non-dependent, “recreational” pattern of drug use, and long
access (LgA) conditions, which leads to dependent drug intake. Escalated drug intake under LgA conditions is
highly relevant to human substance use disorder (SUD) as it has been suggested that it models all 7 of the
criteria for drug addiction in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV and 7 of the 11
criteria in the DSM-V. We showed that HIV Tg rats self-administering oxycodone in this LgA paradigm of
escalated self-administration display increased neural injury and cognitive impairment.
 The project will address the following vexing question about opioid abuse in the setting of HIV infection:
what are the cell types and cell states that drive neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, virus expression, and
escalated (dependent) opioid self-administration and cognitive impairment in the setting of HIV?
 Overall, this collaborative interdisciplinary proposal integrating single cell level transcriptomics, state-of-the-
art behavior methods in HIV Tg and wild-type rats, and computational strategies for the deconvolution of the
gene regulatory network at the single cell level will elucidate key mechanisms that underlie the effects of HIV
and opioid abuse and their detrimental interactions on neuroHIV progression, virus expression and
persistence. The results will indicate transformative new mechanistic hypotheses that may lead to novel
therapeutic concepts for opioid use disorder (OUD) in the setting of HIV and will establish key resources for the
neuroHIV field to be made publicly available through the SCORCH data coordination center and other public
repositories."

Adoptive  Cell  Immunotherapy  using  patient  harvested  T  cells  engineered  against  tumor-­specific  targets  has

10918071,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder with a complex genetic
architecture. The development of effective therapeutics and diagnostic tools for ASD has been hindered by our
incomplete understanding of underlying genetic variation. De novo variants (DNVs), estimated to contribute to
30-40% of cases, have been primarily studied in protein-coding regions of the genome. Hundreds of thousands
of non-coding variants have been identified but deciphering their functional contribution to ASD etiology remains
challenging. Cis-regulatory elements such as promoters and enhancers represent one avenue to assay the
potential impact of non-coding DNVs, but their regulatory activity is dependent on cellular contexts such as cell
type and activation state. The two cell types primarily involved in ASD biology are excitatory (glutamatergic) and
inhibitory (GABAergic) neurons, both of which can be generated in vitro from human pluripotent stem cells and
depolarized to model the transcriptomic and epigenetic changes caused by neuronal activation. Our lab
annotated the enhancers present in both cell types at baseline and activated states and found 2495 enhancers
containing non-coding ASD DNVs, including several hundred that are cell-type specific or activity-dependent.
Using a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA), this proposal will determine whether non-coding DNVs found
in individuals with autism alter cis-regulatory activity in glutamatergic or GABAergic human neurons in either
baseline or activated states. Further, gene-enhancer mapping has revealed that a subset of DNV-containing
enhancers is predicted to regulate genes previously implicated in ASD. To validate cis-regulatory activity and to
compare trans-effects on downstream gene networks, a CRISPR inhibition screen will be performed in both cell
types and activation states, targeting 25 ASD genes and their DNV-containing enhancers. If successful, this work
will demonstrate the potential functional contribution of non-coding de novo variants to ASD biology, which has
thus far remained an outstanding question in the field. Moreover, this will generate transcriptomic datasets for
top ASD risk genes in two clinically relevant cell types at both resting and active states to expand upon the
growing number of functional genomics ASD studies, emphasizing convergent regulatory gene networks. This
research will take place at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, containing the 2nd best NIH-funded
neuroscience department and home to the Seaver Autism Center, renowned for bridging basic science and
clinical trials for more effective ASD care. The scientific rigor, innovative techniques, sophisticated analyses,
multi-disciplinary collaborations, and ample mentorship opportunities outlined here would propel me towards a
successful career as an independent research professor studying the molecular mechanisms underlying
psychiatric disorders while mentoring future generations of scientists and advocating for mental health education."
10925421,"Project Summary/Abstract
Despite recent experimental advances in single cell techniques and a concurrent development in
statistical methods, our ability to predict single cell dynamics and identify the biochemical
processes that dictate cell-to-cell variability remains rudimentary. We have identified the key
roadblock in achieving mechanistic understanding of single cell behavior: we do not have
computational methods to integrate single cell data with mechanistic signaling network models.
Building upon our previous work and leveraging cutting-edge developments in neural networks,
we propose a comprehensive research program to bridge this gap.
The central problem in integration of single cell data with mechanistic models is that even large-
scale data only partially constrain the models, leading to a family of models that fit the data equally
well. How do we then choose from the models? Our strategy is to use the Maximum Entropy (Max
Ent) approach which infers the least complex model: one that does not disfavor any outcome
unless warranted by the data and the mechanistic constraints. Over the past decade, we have
pioneered the novel use of Max Ent to model dynamics of biological networks. In the next five
years, we plan to have two main research goals; (1) to build and validate the computational
architecture required to integrate single cell data with models and (2) in close collaboration with
experimentalists, use the developed framework to study the variability in two important
pathways; the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and mechanotransduction. We
envision that this framework will be indispensable in exploring the mechanistic origins of cell-to-
cell variability across a broad range of signaling networks. Notably, under-constrained models are
ubiquitous in many areas of quantitative biology, including two of the laboratory’s other research
foci: metabolism and microbiome dynamics. The program proposed here will directly benefit
integration of large-scale data with mechanistic models and a principled exploration of otherwise
hidden hypotheses."
10843758,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This proposal addresses how the cellular functions of two major cytoskeletal polymer systems, septins and actin,
are coordinated and influence each other. To address this question, I will use the budding yeast S. cerevisiae,
where septins were first discovered, and where I am readily able to combine a ‘bottom up’ in vitro reconstitution
and single molecule imaging approach with a ‘top down’ genetics and live imaging approach. The proposal builds
off of recent discoveries made in the Goode lab, which reveal that septins are organized at the yeast bud neck
into 8-10 evenly-spaced bars, or “pillars”, which co-align with F-actin cables used for intracellular transport. While
work in a number of model organisms has closely linked the in vivo functions of septins and actin, we still have
only a limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying this septin-actin crosstalk. The goal of this
proposal is to define these mechanisms. S. cerevisiae express 5 different septin proteins, which co-polymerize
into filaments and are further organized into higher order structures. My preliminary data show that one of the
septins (Shs1) mediates direct binding to F-actin in vitro, and that loss of SHS1 disrupts actin cable architecture
and function in vivo. In Aim1, I will use targeted mutagenesis to generate new shs1 separation-of-function
mutants disrupting F-actin binding. I will then use these mutants to investigate how Shs1-mediated F-actin
binding contributes to the alignment of actin cables with septin pillars in vivo, and intracellular transport of
secretory vesicles. In Aim2, I will reconstitute purified septin oligomers and filaments decorated with actin-
nucleating formins (Bnr1) and formin-regulatory proteins (e.g., Gin4, Bud6, and the Mlc1-Iqg1-Hof1 complex),
and define their effects on F-actin assembly and organization by TIRF microscopy and single molecule imaging.
These experiments will test several important hypotheses, including: (1) whether septins and Gin4 activate full-
length Bnr1 from autoinhibition to promote actin assembly; (2) whether Iqg1 has regulatory effects on F-actin
and Bnr1, like its human counterpart IQGAP1 (based on a recent study from the Goode lab; Hoeprich et al.,
2022); and (3) whether septin oligomers/filaments themselves (via Shs1) directly influence F-actin bundling and
dynamics. In parallel to these in vitro experiments, I will acutely deplete the same proteins in vivo (using degron
tags) to determine how each contributes to the assembly and alignment of actin cables at the bud neck. My
preliminary data already point to an exciting new role for Iqg1 in controlling actin cable formation during polarized
cell growth. Together, the in vitro and in vivo work outlined in this proposal will: (i) clarify how septins, formins,
and formin-regulatory proteins work in concert to shape actin networks, (ii) define new subunit-specific roles for
septins in actin regulation, (iii) lay a strong foundation for launching my own lab focused on septin-actin crosstalk,
and (iv) provide new leads that will allow me to extend this work in the future (on my own and via collaboration)
into other systems."

Tuberculosis remains a serious global epidemic and with the rise of multi-drug resistant strains, an efficacious
vaccine solution is imperative. Synthetic subunit vaccines, which do not contain live bacteria, present
numerous advantages over attenuated vaccines by offering a safer option for immunocompromised individuals
and being amenable to rapid, scalable, and reproducible production. The subunit vaccines currently being
developed for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) use peptide or protein antigens, which target MHC-restricted
conventional T cells, overlooking the potential of Mtb lipid antigens as vaccine candidates. Mycobacterial lipids
are presented by group 1 CD1 (CD1a, b, c) and group 2 CD1d to cognate T cells. Group 1 CD1-restricted T
cells can be identified in patients with TB and have been shown to contribute to protective immunity against
Mtb infection. In order to study further study group 1 CD1-restricted Mtb response, we previously created CD1
expressing transgenic mice (hCD1Tg) and CD1b-restricted T cell receptor transgenic T cells (DN1Tg) specific
for the dominant Mtb lipid antigen mycolic acid (MA). We have since showed that DN1 T cells can be activated
in vivo by vaccination with nanoparticles (NP) loaded with MA. We immunized hCD1Tg-DN1 mice with MA-NP
to generate memory DN1 T cells. Using transcriptome analysis, we then determined that memory DN1 T cells
most closely resemble T follicular helper (TFH) cells. In this proposal, we will assess whether two key TFH cell
molecules, Bcl6 and PD-1, are necessary for memory DN1 T cell differentiation. We will also validate findings
in the polyclonal setting using single cell sequencing. Finally, we will test whether memory DN1 T cell can
provide protection in Mtb infection conditions. Through this work, we will be able to understand unique
determinants of memory group 1 CD1-restricted T cells differentiation and their role in Mtb infection bringing us
a step closer to creating a lipid-based vaccine for Mtb."
10908433,"We previously showed that tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) produced within the kidney is part of a
mechanism that regulates renal function and the blood pressure (BP) response to increases in dietary salt
intake. Our recent studies suggest that TNF effects in the kidney are evident in the medullary (m) thick
ascending limb (TAL), proximal tubule (PT), and cortical (c) TAL/macula densa (MD) regions of the nephron.
However, the cellular sources within the kidney that produce the TNF that accounts for these effects have not
been determined, nor have the molecular mechanisms been identified. Thus, we developed two mouse
models in which TNF has been genetically deleted in the: 1) TAL, and 2) distal nephron downstream of the PT,
which will be used to understand the role of TNF produced by renal epithelial cells as part of an emerging
intratubular TNF system that attenuates increases in BP induced by high salt (HS) intake. We also have
tailored a complementary approach, using PT- and TAL-specific TNF silencing lentivirus constructs, to
specifically inhibit TNF production by these cell types. The genetic and lentivirus approaches will be used in
tandem to determine the mechanism by which TNF regulates Na+-K+-2Cl- (NKCC2) phosphorylation and
isoform expression, renal function, and BP. Preliminary data suggest that TNF, via activation of TNF receptor
1 (TNFR1), inhibits phospho-NKCC2 (pNKCC2) expression by a mechanism involving activation of the
serine/threonine phosphatase, calcineurin (CN). The effects of TNF on CN have not been explored in the
kidney, thus experiments will address TNF-dependent increases in CN activity as well as expression of the
catalytic subunit CNAb and regulatory subunit CNB. The genetic and lentivirus strategies will be adapted to
determine the effects of salt intake on TNFR1-dependent CN-mediated inhibition of pNKCC2 expression,
electrolyte excretion, and the BP response to HS intake. The NKCC2A and NKCC2B isoforms are strategically
localized along the mammalian TAL and contribute to regulatory functions in response to high and low salt
conditions, respectively. TNF inhibits the expression of both isoforms suggesting a role for this cytokine in both
the mTAL and cTAL/MD segments of the TAL. We previously showed that in each instance, TNF regulates
renal function involving these isoforms in a manner that limits reabsorption of NaCl. However, the molecular
mechanism by which TNF suppresses both NKCC2A and NKCC2B mRNA in response to high and low salt
intake, respectively, has not been determined. Previous miRNA profiling of the TAL in combination with new
preliminary data have identified 3 candidate miRNAs that regulate NKCC2 isoform mRNA abundance. For
instance, miRNA-195 expression is induced by TNF derived from the TAL and inhibits NKCC2A mRNA
accumulation and pNKCC2 expression in mice ingesting HS. Collectively, the studies will define a novel
intratubular regulatory system in which TNF production by renal tubular epithelial cells, in response to
increases in salt intake, regulates NKCC2 isoform expression and function and contributes to BP homeostasis."

For the last 21 years, The University of Texas-Houston (UTH) has been a vital part of the
Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units (MFMU) Network. We have always been committed to the
mission to garner unbiased data. With upward of 3.6 million annual deliveries in this country, the
need for prospectively collected data from multiple centers or randomized clinical trials (RCT)
remains of the utmost importance. The need for a research consortium of this nature has never
been more crucial; a fact made evident during our recent COVID-19 pandemic.
Because of our long history within the MFMU network, we have developed and refined the
necessary infrastructure and research skills to be successful. The UTH research team has a
combined research experience of over 80 years and abundant clinical knowledge with over 100
years of working on labor and delivery. Prioritizing participation in the Network is ingrained in
our Division. Our Chair, MFM Division Director, and Fellowship Director have all served as
Network PI and alternate PIs. Within our Division, we have a combined 40-year experience as
PI or alternate PI. Our center consistently ranks among the top sites in the percentage of
patients enrolled from the eligible pool. Currently, we recruit from 3 hospitals, with upwards of
11,000 combined births annually including over 75% from underrepresented minorities. Our
follow-up rates have consistently exceeded 90% for pre-planned long-term studies.
To further cement our value as a member of the Network, we continue to demonstrate great
academic productivity. Since 2018, we have published over 260 peer-reviewed articles,
congruent with the MFMU Network’s aims. In the last five years, UTH faculty and Fellows have
published 15 RCT, with two-thirds of the trials being multi-centered. One of these trials (Dinis J
et al. Am J Obstet Gynecol. 2020) served as the basis for the recently completed Network trial—
Prescription After Cesarean Trial (PACT). Our faculty and fellows continue to be active in
proposing primary proposals to the Network and suggesting hypothesis-generating secondary
analyses from existing MFMU data. Independent of the Network, we continue to publish
secondary analyses, and our MFM Fellows and faculty are conducting several RCTs that do not
interfere with current ongoing MFMU trials.
We remain committed to the MFMU network by ensuring proper conduct of the studies,
maintaining our performance ranks in the top half in all aspects, and aiming to continually
improve the rates of eligible people randomized, follow-up, and data quality metrics."

In this renewal application, we highlight the ability, commitment and strengths of Emory University to continue
its more than 3 decades of participation in the Eunice Kennedy Shriver NICHD Multicenter Neonatal Research
Network (NRN). As the largest metropolitan city in the US with a single perinatal-referral center (Emory) and
single academic children's health system (Children's Healthcare of Atlanta-CHOA), we have a large pool of
high-risk admissions. Our center brings together 3 Emory-affiliated Atlanta hospitals: Grady Memorial Hospital,
the largest hospital in Georgia with a focus on caring for underserved populations; Emory University Hospital
Midtown, a high-volume delivery hospital and high-risk maternal center; and CHOA at Egleston, a quaternary
referral center. These sites care for ~8,000 live-births and 1,800 neonatal admissions per year with a single
group of neonatologists from the Pediatric Institute at Emory and CHOA. The inborn extremely preterm infants
and their families comprise populations typically under-enrolled in neonatal trials (87% Black; 3% White) with
diverse sociodemographic characteristics. The Emory center has deep expertise in clinical trials and
epidemiology and a robust infrastructure for clinical research with strong institutional support. Dr. Ravi Patel
will continue to lead the Emory site. He has been NRN PI since 2020 and served as site-PI for 6 randomized
trials since 2012. He has nationally-recognized expertise in neonatal transfusion medicine, necrotizing
enterocolitis, caffeine therapy and perinatal epidemiology. Additionally, Dr. Patel received scientific approval by
the NRN Steering Committee for a randomized trial of platelet transfusion strategies that could be implemented
in the upcoming cycle. Dr. Brenda Poindexter, Chief of the Division of Neonatology, is an established clinical
investigator and internationally renowned researcher in neonatal nutrition. She will continue as alternate PI,
bringing long-standing expertise and service to the NRN as Chair of the Protocol Subcommittee and as NRN
PI for two prior institutions (Indiana University, 2006-2014 and Cincinnati Children's, 2014-2020). Dr. Nathalie
Maitre will continue as follow-up PI, a role she began in 2016. She is a neuroscientist and established follow-up
investigator with unique expertise in the development of quantitative measures of infant neural function. Drs.
Barbara Stoll and Lucky Jain will continue as collaborators, along with a cadre of other talented investigators.
Emory investigators led the two most cited NRN publications in the past decade. Additional strengths include:
1) A consolidated neonatology research infrastructure directed by the PI with 4.5 FTE of coordinators. This
ensures prioritization of NRN studies and the ability to enroll 24/7; 2) Comprehensive follow-up program, with
one of the highest follow-up rates in the NRN and 5 trials with 100% follow-up; 3) Close academic links to the
Marcus Autism center, Emory-Georgia Tech biomedical engineering program, Rollins School of Public Health
and CDC; 4) Strong institutional research strength: Department of Pediatrics ranked #4 in NIH funding; 5)
Broad divisional engagement with the NRN: 10 current faculty have led or served as site-PI for NRN studies."
10913325,"TR&D Project 1: A FAIR Data and Metadata Foundation for Reproducible Research (DISCOVER)
SUMMARY
Our NCBIB resource, ReproNim: A Center for Reproducible Neuroimaging Computation, seeks to
continue to drive a shift in the way neuroimaging research is performed and reported to improve the
reproducibility of neuroimaging science and extend the value of our national investment in neuroimaging
research. In this Technology Research and Development Project, TR&D 1 - A FAIR Data and Metadata
Foundation for Reproducible Research, we focus on the necessary tools and best practices to enable the
efficient annotation of scientific data and the effective search for and discovery of this data and its associated
workflows and software. During the current period, we have developed robust data annotation tools for raw and
derived data and associated tools for discovery. The data annotation tools are supported by an infrastructure
for managing the necessary terminologies required for annotation. Our tools and procedures support the “FAIR
Data Principles” which describe a set of key principles that will ensure data’s value to the research community
such that the data are Findable (with sufficient explicit metadata), Accessible (for humans and machines),
Interoperable (using standard definitions and Common Data Elements), and Reusable (meeting community
standards, and sufficiently documented). The Office of Data Science at NIH has endorsed these principles and
NIH has recently incorporated them in their most recent policy for data management and sharing
(NOT-OD-21-013) that requires the preservation and sharing of scientific data from all research, funded or
conducted in whole or in part by NIH. The tools and services provided by TR&D1 will therefore not only assist
researchers in performing reproducible neuroimaging, but also in the utilization of the increased amounts of
data being made available as part of this data sharing policy. Support for researchers will be accomplished via
two specific aims: 1) Production of FAIR data through metadata annotation and alignment allowing for the
sharing and publication of these data; and 2) Enabling data discovery and cohort generation for researchers to
be able to effectively re-use FAIR data for re-analysis or re-execution. These two complementary aims will be
supported by a third aim focused on support and training: 3) Extend and harden existing ReproNim software
for FAIR data publication and discovery in coordination with the community. This aim will ensure that the tools
we develop will be more accessible to those who have limited technical experience and will be complemented
by training modules and support for different user experience levels and use-cases. This suite of tools, part of
the larger ReproNim toolset, enables researchers to work within a FAIR data ecosystem. We will carry out this
work in collaboration with the other ReproNim technology research and development projects and our
Collaborative and Service projects. Together, we will help researchers become more efficient in the production
and sharing of FAIR data, promoting the ability of these researchers to utilize a growing collection of well
described data and to advance knowledge and explore the generalizability of scientific claims."
10913329,"TR&D Project 2: Improving Research Efficiency through Better Descriptors (DESCRIBE)
SUMMARY: The scale and complexity of neuroimaging research have grown exponentially over the last three
decades and have enabled new insights into human cognition in health and disease and development of new
imaging hardware, processing, and informatics technologies. As new information has proliferated into the
research ecosystem, there is a need to integrate this knowledge from publications, data sources, and analysis
tools. This integration has been hampered by limited harmonization of description across these digital outputs.
During the current period, this Technology Research and Development Project, TR&D2, has addressed some
of these challenges. We extended the Neuroimaging Data Model (NIDM) - a descriptor framework built on top
of the World Wide Web Consortium's Provenance Data Model (W3C-PROV) and backed by community-
developed ontologies. Using such standards we also created a set of technologies with our ReproNim projects
and partners to enable reproducible analytics, to harmonize data and results, and to gather standardized
provenance. This proposal aims to increase research efficiency and overall trust in scientific findings through
better description of digital objects and better provenance of analytics. To accomplish these overarching goals,
we will: 1) Formalize detailed and structured descriptors of all stages of a neuroimaging research workflow.
This is critical for interpreting and trusting scientific results. 2) Develop a resource to create and disseminate
Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable (FAIR) and robust scientific workflows. This will enable users to
trust and reuse existing and well-tested analyses, as well as disseminate their own scripts when such analyses
are not available. 3) Extend and harden existing ReproNim technologies in coordination with the community.
We will integrate our technologies through developers of other tools, thus making our technologies more
accessible to those who have limited technical experience. This effort will be complemented by training and
support for different user experience levels and use cases. We will deliver a set of technologies that allows
researchers to harmonize their output by design, from assessment and imaging data collection to final results.
These technologies will also support consolidation and reuse of existing workflows, with new processes being
developed only when necessary. Finally, our tools will support community-based generation, curation, and
management of standardized information. We will carry out this work in collaboration with the other ReproNim
technology research and development projects, and our collaborative and service projects. Together, we will
help researchers become more effective through increased efficiency in every facet of the research lifecycle.
TR&D2 technologies support the overall mission of ReproNim to improve the way neuroimaging research is
performed and reported, to enable a comprehensive set of data management, analysis and utilization
frameworks in support of both basic research and clinical activities, and to improve the reproducibility of
neuroimaging science and extend the value of our national investment in neuroimaging research."
10913333,"TR&D Project 3: Efficient and reproducible execution from data collection to processing (DO)
SUMMARY: The ReproNim project seeks to transform neuroimaging practice, to make research more efficient
and effective in such a way that also makes it reproducible as a result. As more data, metadata, and computing
resources become available to the neuroimaging community, tools and frameworks for managing data and
processing workflows that ensure consistent control over all of the digital objects of science become
increasingly important. Such tools should assist in obtaining valid results while establishing their provenance
and minimizing the need for manual curation and intervention; they should not get in the way of doing
research. In this Technology Research and Development Project, TR&D 3, we establish new approaches, as
well as adopt and contribute back to existing tools, to automate many stages of data collection and analysis,
making efficient use of local or remote computing resources that are available to the researchers. In particular,
we aim to 1) Automate “Doing (execution of) an experiment” through collection and representation of data,
metadata, and provenance across all stages of a neuroimaging acquisition, including all the data types that
could be important for quality assurance and proper accounting for possible confounding factors, such as
audio/video stimuli, physiological recordings, details of the experimental design. Automated integration of
imaging and non-imaging data not only makes research more efficient and labor saving, it also makes
collected and shared data more comprehensive, accurate, and reproducible. 2) Make computational resources
(GPUs, local High Performance Computing centers, and cloud computing resources) conveniently and
efficiently available to researchers to perform execution of needed data transformations (conversion, analysis,
etc.). While orchestrating execution we will record detailed provenance information, sufficient for re-execution
of any stage of the research process, and make it available to the researcher alongside with the produced
results. Efficient use of computational resources and collection of detailed provenance will facilitate
experimentation and application of bleeding edge analysis workflows, while reducing necessary technological
know-how. 3) Maintain, support, and extend existing ReproNim and related software and data resources that
we and our partners have made available openly to the community. This effort will be complemented by
training modules and support for different user experience levels and use cases. Ensuring such continuity in
availability and robust operation of tools, computing environments, and data resources is essential for any
effort aiming to support efficient and reproducible computation. We will carry out this work in collaboration with
the other ReproNim technology research and development projects, our collaborative and service projects, and
the neuroimaging community at large. This work will automate and conveniently interface complex
technologies while facilitating use of established data standards and provenance recording, lowering the
technological expertise necessary for neuroimaging scientists to advance knowledge."
10913338,"SUMMARY: Curbing irreproducibility and increasing efficiency and efficacy in research disciplines relying on
brain imaging requires not only new technologies and tools, but also a strong component of community
engagement and training. During the first phase (2016-2020) the ReproNim training core has developed and
disseminated educational material for reproducible neuroimaging through four in-person workshops and a
series of training activities timed with the OHBM, SfN, and NeuroInformatics conferences. We have also
developed a Massively Online Open course (MOOC) on the Moodle platform to widely disseminate our training
material, and have launched the “Train the Trainer” fellowship program in partnership with the International
Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility (INCF). Most ReproNim Fellows (18 out of 21) reported they are
organizing training events; to date Fellows alone have trained well over 500 trainees . During this first phase,
we also learned which activities were the most efficient in disseminating ReproNim training. In the next phase,
we propose to extend and complement our previous work in three directions. First, we will develop more
comprehensive material, adapted to different trainee backgrounds. We will use specific common key user
stories to develop materials that will demonstrate how these can be answered with the combined use of the
ReproTools. Second, acknowledging that with limited resources we cannot only rely on training everyone
through our own workshops, we will be working on scalable solutions to training by 1) rolling out a more
complete version of our MOOC, and 2) extending our Train the Trainer fellowship program to operate a
pyramid scheme, such that our Fellows not only develop educational programs in their local environs, but
leverage the Train-the-Trainer materials to conduct their own Trainer programs. Third, as materials are being
constantly developed in a distributed manner and need to be up-to-date, we will implement better findability
and accessibility to updated training material through the development of an inventory of annotated links to
training resources. While working on these goals, we will be building a community of trainees and (future)
trainers able to participate in the development, dissemination and use of reproducible neuroimaging research
practices and tools."

10897303,"High-throughput technologies have transformed biology by enabling deep phenotyping of living organisms.
Deep phenotyping in genetically randomized populations provides a powerful resource for understanding
cause and effect – this is the promise of systems genetics and precision medicine. Despite the advances in
data collection and the availability of genetic and genomic resources, generation of actionable knowledge from
these data presents computational and statistical challenges. The goal of the GeneNetwork project is to
provide a platform of innovation to make the best use of the data and computational tools for systems genetics.
The proposed project will focus on broadening the impact of the web service by broadening community
participation in the web service and strengthening computational engine powering the web service. We will
enhance our database by providing automated tools for data entry and curation (Aim 1); we will improve tools
for genetic analysis of high-throughput traits (Aim 2); enable bidirectional information sharing between animal

10929310,"Project Summary:
Over the last two decades, enabled by progress in synchrotron radiation techniques, molecular biology
methods, and computational resources, there has been tremendous progress in determining the
conformations of biomolecules that has led to deep structural and functional insights. But there is another
dimension to biological function, namely dynamics, which is, as yet, underexplored. This has created a
serious blind spot that inhibits progress towards a full understanding of macromolecular functions and
biological processes. The broad objective of this proposal is to utilize and develop computer simulations
that address this deficiency in knowledge by rigorously modeling biomolecular dynamics to increase our
understanding of biological processes. More specifically, we will pursue three interrelated projects. First,
we will determine how chromatin remodeling factors influence the dynamics of nucleosomes and
chromatin fibers as a means of epigenetic gene regulation. Second, we will examine the mechanisms of key
virulence factors in bacteria, including how they scagence iron from hosts and how they defended
themselves from peptidomimetics. Finally, we will develop computational methods that more effectively
model the results of solution small angle X-ray scattering experiments for diverse biomolecular complexes.
Completion of these studies will reveal intricate details about the relationship between the structure,
function, and dynamics of multicomponent biomolecular complexes across a vast range of time and length
scales. Furthermore, the synergy between the scientific goals, as well as the computational methods and
strong experimental collaborations in each of these projects, will foster new opportunities and areas of
scientific inquiry that the MIRA award will allow us to pursue. Overall, this work will address a series of
fundamental gaps in knowledge for critical biological processes, and will lay the foundation for future
studies that will improve the treatment and prevention of human ailments."
10918198,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Approximately 43 million adults in the U.S. struggle to comprehend basic texts. This is a major public health
crisis given the strong association between reading comprehension (RC) ability and broad health and
economic outcomes, including more than 300 billion annual economic burden related to low literacy in the US.
Despite the prevalence of low RC, meta-analyses of behavioral interventions and national statistics in the US
reveal no significant RC gains over the past 30 years. This is due in part to limitations of behavioral
approaches to characterize the complex processes involved in RC. Brain research has identified more granular
mechanisms of RC/RC ability. This includes my own research that has identified brain pathways that promote
behavioral resilience in RC disorders, i.e. brain pathways that mitigate severe symptoms in RC disorders.
However, brain research has thus far been unable to apply brain network science for a direct, clinical benefit.
The goal of the current proposal is to address the need for brain-based RC interventions by integrating recent
breakthroughs in two separate fields: brain network science of RC resilience and non-invasive brain network
stimulation. I have established a line of research that uses functional MRI and EEG to characterize brain
signatures of RC ability and resilience. I have found that cross-network communication between the reading-
language brain network (RLN) and a brain network responsible for goal-oriented thought (the cognitive control
network; CCN) is more predictive of RC outcomes than within-network communication (e.g. RLN alone).
These results mirror findings in a range of disorders that connect the CCN to resilience and provide a
compelling target for brain intervention. In a separate field, brain stimulation has also seen a recent
breakthrough: using EEG-guided, individually-tuned stimulation of full networks results in recovered memory
capacity in older adults that outlasts stimulation, but this has not been applied to other domains. The proposed
project will take advantage of recent advances in RC brain network science and non-invasive brain stimulation
to develop a safe, brain-based RC intervention protocol. I hypothesize that promotion of cross-network
connectivity will result in increased RC ability particularly in low RC groups. In this project, I will determine: the
causal effects of cross- vs within-network stimulation on readers' RC ability and brain metrics (Aim 1); how
stimulation outcomes interact with individual differences in baseline RC ability/brain metrics (Aim 2); and the
efficacy of stimulation beyond behavioral training effects (Aim 3). N = 225 adults with good and poor RC ability
will be tested across 3 visits: a pre-intervention visit for baseline behavior and fMRI/EEG metrics; a stimulation
visits (randomized/subject for cross- vs. within-network targets) with behavior and fMRI/EEG metrics, and a
post-intervention visit to measure prolonged behavior and fMRI/EEG effects. Before stimulation, subjects will
receive a short RC intervention. This approach will allow us to establish the efficacy of cutting-edge stimulation
approaches in adult literacy, with potential applications in a range of other disorders."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) accounts for about 70% of dementia cases, and the number of AD patients continues
to grow substantially due to the worldwide phenomenon of population aging, prompting the call for innovative
technologies that will enable the early identification of patients at risk and monitoring of disease progression and
therapeutic response. There is a known sequence of pathological alterations that develop in Alzheimer’s disease
(AD) long before frank cognitive decline, offering potential targets for early detection of disease onset with
subsequent interventions. While volumetric MRI changes are useful to assess the presence of
neurodegeneration, regional cortical volume loss is a relatively late structural marker of neurodegeneration in
AD. On the other hand, diffusion MRI (dMRI) is a non-invasive imaging technique sensitive to pathological
changes on the cellular level, at least three orders of magnitude below the nominal spatial resolution of
conventional MRI. So far, most AD studies using dMRI have largely focused on white matter changes. However,
on histopathology, AD is primarily a cortical disease. The ability to probe early microstructural changes in GM in
vivo would open the door to assessing disease onset and progression, facilitating the development of disease-
modifying therapy. This project will bridge the gap in understanding changes in GM tissue microstructure in AD
and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using a combination of tools in multiple domains, such as biophysical
modeling, ex vivo and in vivo dMRI, and histological validation. We will address this multi-faceted research
challenge through the following aims: Aim 1: Establish time-dependent dMRI measurements to evaluate the
density of axonal varicosities, size of cell body (soma), and soma/neurite density using a high-gradient MRI
system. By leveraging the very strong diffusion gradients on the current and next-generation Connectome MRI
scanner, we will develop a novel technique for evaluating the tissue microstructure in healthy subjects, AD and
MCI patients. Aim 2: Validate in vivo and ex vivo dMRI measures of axonal and soma structure via Monte Carlo
simulations of diffusion and histological analysis in three-dimensional realistic substrates based on light and
electron microscopy, and micro-CT data. Aim 3: Assess the correlation of GM microstructural parameters with
cognitive dysfunction, amyloid and tau PET scans, and blood and cerebrospinal fluid protein biomarkers, such
as amyloid beta, total and phosphorylated tau (P-tau 181 and P-tau 217).
 In summary, building on our previous success in assessing white matter microstructure using dMRI, our
study in GM promises to provide reliable noninvasive imaging markers of neurodegeneration, facilitating our
understanding of the mechanisms underlying the progression of AD. Ultimately, the quantification of GM
microstructure will offer prognostic and confirmatory biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases, facilitating the
assessment of treatment efficacy with the emergence of new therapies for AD and related dementias."
10911111,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory, demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system (CNS). A
great deal of our understanding about the immunologic processes that underlie MS derives from studies in its
autoimmune animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). However, the vast majority of
studies in EAE and MS have focused on evaluating and targeting CD4+ T cell responses, with the general
assumption that these diseases are predominantly Th1/Th17-mediated and Th2/Treg-modulated. Recent
reports from others and us indicate that CD8+ T cells play a role in the pathogenesis as well as regulation of
autoimmune demyelination. Our studies in MS and EAE have provided evidence for a novel and
unexpected disease suppressive role for CNS-specific CD8+ T cells (CNS-CD8). Based on our data, we
hypothesize that specific functional and phenotypic subsets of CNS-CD8 form an important and
exploitable arm of immune regulation during autoimmune demyelinating disease. We propose that this
process can be harnessed for the development of effective immunotherapeutic approaches. The
experiments proposed in this application will utilize EAE models to address the fundamental cellular and
molecular mechanisms of immune modulation (IFNγ and its receptor, trafficking and cytotoxicity, suppression
at the site of pathology) by these autoregulatory CD8 T cells, and to define a potent and enhanceable immune
suppressive subset of CNS-CD8. Further, a novel vaccination strategy that reliably engages disease-reversing
CNS-CD8 will also be investigated as a proof of principle. We believe that achievable results from the
proposed experiments will provide greater fundamental insights into CD8 T cell-mediated immune regulation
and pave the way for newer intervention strategies for MS and other immune-mediated diseases."

These capabilities will allow NIAID to rapidly and efficiently address development and production gaps."
11041789,"The development of effective HIV vaccines and other prevention strategies relies on the use of nonhuman primates (NHPs) in preclinical studies. To meet this need, the Simian Vaccine Evaluation Units (SVEUs) provide NHP resources that primarily support preclinical evaluation of AIDS vaccines and prevention modalities. The SVEU program will provide NIAID the ability to evaluate candidate AIDS vaccines using NHP models in which thorough evaluations of systemic and mucosal immune responses can be conducted, vaccine efficacy can easily be tested, correlates of reduced risk of virus acquisition can be identified, and approaches to enhance immunogenicity and efficacy of clinical vaccines can be conducted. The SVEUs will provide a responsive, flexible vaccine resource that is available to NIH-supported researchers and can support all stages of AIDS vaccine research, from preclinical evaluation or clinical testing of candidate AIDS vaccines, with the objective of identifying a vaccine that will generate immune responses able to prevent or control viral infection. The scope of the SVEUs includes housing and maintenance of NHPs, the conduct of studies supporting AIDS prevention research, with an emphasis on AIDS vaccines, support of a NHP breeding colony, and general administration and management of these activities."
10896467,"Project Summary
Children with Callous-Unemotional (CU) traits, which are defined by impairments in empathy, prosociality, and
guilt, represent a uniquely at-risk subset of children with conduct disorder. These children have worse prognoses
and response to treatments than children with conduct disorder alone. As a result, many of them suffer from poor
educational achievement, substance use disorders, and antisocial behaviors. Genetic and environmental factors
both affect the development of CU traits, which can occur as early as age 3 years. Twin studies place the
heritability of CU traits around 58-81%, with the most implicated genes coding for neurotransmitter receptor
variants. Due to the potential genetic effect on brain development, prior studies in adolescents have investigated
and found alterations in emotion processing and emotion regulation areas of the brain. However, it is unknown
whether these brain changes precede the early development of CU traits or occur later as a result of the
pathology.
To address this gap, we will leverage a unique, prospective, longitudinal cohort of 385 mother-infant dyads
(recruited through R01 MH113883) that includes state-of-the-art neonatal neuroimaging, parental measures of
CU traits (added by the applicant), and measures of offspring CU traits at age 3 years (added by the applicant).
We hypothesize that altered functional brain connectivity in the newborn period, which occurs prior to postnatal
environmental exposures, will mediate the heritable link between parent’s and children’s CU traits. To test this
hypothesis, we plan to link CU traits in both mothers and fathers to CU traits in their children at age 3 years.
Second, we will explore the relationship between neonatal functional connectivity in emotion processing and
emotion regulation regions and CU traits at age 3 years. Finally, we will examine the role of neonatal functional
connectivity in mediating heritable relationships between parent and children CU traits.
Critically, this proposed project builds upon the candidate’s strong background and experience in neuroimaging
analyses and behavioral assessments, enabling development of new skills across the domains of quantitative
methods and atypical child development. Finally, not only will this project improve the understanding of aberrant
brain development underlying early CU traits, but it will also provide the necessary background for the candidate
to become a highly successful academic physician-scientist investigating the biological underpinnings of CU
traits and treating patients with externalizing disorders."
10893356,"Project Summary/Abstract
 This proposal responds to an FOA (RFA-NS-18-030) calling for 1) “novel approaches to understand neural
circuitry associated with well-defined social behaviors;” 2) Distributed circuits that contribute to the coordination
of motivational states and reward behavior;” 3) “Empirical and analytical approaches to understand how
behavioral states are emergent properties of the interaction of neurons, circuits and networks.” The study of
subcortical circuits that control conserved, naturalistic behaviors is crucial to understanding brain function. We
aim to understand how dynamic interactions between different circuit nodes in the Hypothalamic-Extended
Amygdala Decision (“HEAD”) network control innate social behavior decisions, e.g., between aggressive and
reproductive behaviors. We propose an integrated approach to this problem that combines microendoscopic
imaging (MEI) of genetically identified neuronal subpopulations with automated, machine learning-based
classification of social behavior in freely moving mice, together with functional perturbations of neuronal activity
in vivo. Our broad, long-term objective is to understand how distributed activity among interconnected
structures in the HEAD network controls moment-to-moment decisions between competing goal-directed
behaviors that are crucial for the survival of animals and humans. The central objective of this proposal is to
understand how information flows through this network during social interactions, and is decoded to control the
decision to engage in reproductive vs. aggressive social behaviors. To understand how activity in “upstream”
nodes controls neural representations in “downstream” nodes, we will implement a novel approach combining
reversible chemogenetic inhibition of the former with concurrent imaging of neuronal population activity in the
latter. The rationale for this approach is that an understanding of the system requires characterizing the effects
of functional manipulations on both behavioral and circuit-level phenotypes. To achieve our objective, we will
first characterize the neural coding of behavior and conspecific sex identity in multiple nodes of the extended
amygdala, using single-site microendoscopic imaging and computational analytic approaches (Aim 1);
determine how perturbations in the activity of such nodes influence representations in hypothalamic nodes
(Aim 2); investigate the roles of intra- and inter-nuclear interactions in determining the balance of activity
between aggression and reproduction-promoting hypothalamic nodes (Aim 3); determine how this balance is
decoded by downstream mid-brain structures to determine the type of social behavior to express (Aim 4). This
contribution is significant because it represents a systems-level approach to understanding how a subcortical
network controls behavioral decision-making. The contribution is innovative because it integrates analysis of
neuronal population activity, quantitative measurement of naturalistic social behavior and functional
perturbations of activity in specific neuronal subpopulations to gain insight into how distributed neural circuits
control survival behaviors, in a context that is relevant to maladaptations causing human psychiatric disorders."
10915005,"Premise: HIV associated CVD is a significant cause of clinical morbidity and a barrier to successful aging
among persons living with HIV (PWH). To date, HIV-CVD research has emphasized ischemic coronary heart
disease. However, nearly 80% of the global CVD burden exists in developing nations and 70% of the HIV
epidemic exists in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) where heart failure (HF) is the predominant CVD manifestation.
Data from high income countries (HIC) has established that chronic HIV disease contributes to increased risk
for ventricular dysfunction and clinical HF. We have shown that asymptomatic PWH in South Africa (SA) have
greater diffuse myocardial fibrosis by CMR, when compared to uninfected controls, representing structural
changes that may increase risk for HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). These findings support our
hypothesis that risk for HF will be increased among PWH taking ART in SA, and will manifest predominantly as
HFpEF. Unifying mechanistic features of HFpEF have been proposed but the pathogenesis is heavily
influenced by the presence of co-morbid end-organ diseases. This has motivated attempts to characterize
clinical `phenogroups' of HFpEF based on the profile of comorbid conditions. When compared to HICs, the
relative frequencies of co-morbid conditions (e.g., obesity, hypertension) and other risk factors (e.g., mTB,
substance use) differs in low-to-middle income countries like SA. The unique risk factor profiles of PWH in SA
will then result in distinct HFpEF phenogroups and changes to underlying cardiac structure.
Approach: We propose to enroll PWH and uninfected controls, utilize echocardiography to adjudicate HF
subgroups, and then identify a cohort of PWH with HFpEF to study clinical and biologic factors in greater detail.
The target population includes patients living in Khayelitsha township, outside of Cape Town, SA, who are age
≥40 years and on ART with viral suppression (if living with HIV). Standardized clinical echocardiogram (ECHO)
will be used to adjudicate HF status and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) will be used to characterize the
injury pattern of cardiac fibrosis among those with HF. Our proposal includes following specific aims:
Aim 1: Estimate the prevalence of HF due to ventricular dysfunction in SA, as well as the effect of treated-HIV.
Aim 2: Determine the clinical phenogroup(s) that define HFpEF among PWH on ART, age ≥40, in SA.
Aim 3: Explore immunologic factors that may contribute to myocardial fibrosis and HFpEF risk in PWH.
Research and Health Implications: This proposal targets a large unmet need in the HIV-CVD field. HIV
associated HF is a clinically significant challenge, and data from HIC do not adequately represent LMIC like
SA. In addition, HFpEF can result from heterogeneous pathologies, and HIV disease may influence HFpEF risk
through multiple pathways depending on underlying risk. Our proposal will determine the burden of HFpEF
among PWH, develop POC approaches for identifying those at risk, and identify clinical and biologic features
that may be targeted in HIV-CVD clinical trials within a global region where most of the HIV epidemic resides."
11080128,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of cognitive and motor impairment in the United States and is
estimated to result in long-term disability in approximately 1 to 2 percent of the population. Currently, all
pharmacological therapies focused on limiting neurodegeneration after TBI have been unsuccessful in
preventing secondary sequelae. Therefore, the prevention of secondary cognitive and motor sequelae is a
significant unmet need in neuroscience research.
Long myelinated axons within white matter are vulnerable to physical trauma and disruption of these tracts after
TBI results in white matter atrophy that is strongly correlated with both cognitive and motor dysfunction. Myelin
is generated by mature oligodendrocytes and is essential for robust propagation of action potentials and for the
survival and integrity of neuronal axons. Oligodendrocyte death and demyelination can therefore result in
increased vulnerability of axons, predisposing them to degeneration. Although progressive and chronic white
matter abnormalities are reported after TBI, the mechanisms initiated by mechanical strain on brain tissue that
contribute to oligodendrocyte dysfunction and white matter loss remain poorly defined. My preliminary data show
that multifactorial TBI induces dynamic changes in the oligodendrocyte lineage. With publicly available RNA
sequencing data I demonstrate that Yes-associated protein (YAP) may transcriptionally activate genes
upregulated in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) after TBI. YAP and its co-transcriptional activator PDZ-
binding motif (TAZ) are the nuclear effectors of the Hippo signaling pathway, a highly conserved pathway that
regulates organ growth and regeneration. Oligodendrocytes and OPCs are known to respond to mechanical
stimuli such as shear stress through the actions of YAP, however the consequences of YAP hyperactivity in this
lineage are unknown. I demonstrate that YAP hyperactivity is sufficient to impair OPC differentiation. The aims
of this proposal will seek to define 1) how modulation of YAP activity affects differentiation and proliferation of
OPCs and 2) whether YAP maintains the progenitor state in OPCs and unlocks a cryptic transcriptional program
when hyperactivated. These aims will be achieved using a combination stem cell biology and genomics
techniques, in conjunction with in vivo disease modeling. Understanding the functional consequences of YAP
activity in the oligodendrocyte lineage will offer new opportunities to prevent or reverse the neurological sequalae
of traumatic brain injury that affect millions of Americans."
10910228,"The goal of this research is to develop a sensor device prototype to rapidly measure an array of diverse
salivary biomarkers as input for novel machine learning (ML) methods that can predict periodontitis and
monitor periodontal progression. Our long-term goal is to develop a rapid, user-friendly, and low-cost pointof-care (POC) device, for use in either a dentist’s office or at home, that rapidly integrates and analyzes data
to support patient management. It addresses the priority area of the Data Science, Computational Biology,
and Bioinformatics Program of NIDCR in integrating and analyzing high-volume and diverse data to better
understand dental, oral, and craniofacial biology and diseases.
According to the CDC, nearly 50% adults have some form of periodontal disease. Perioodontitis is silently
progressive and patients often seek professional care only in an advanced stage where advanced, painful
and costly procedures are needed to control disease or replace lost teeth. Early detection of periodontal
disease at an individual patient level is required and there is growing awareness that multiple biomarkers are
valued in predicting risk of disease in individuals. We hypothesize that predictive models can be established
based on the measurements of a large set of periodontitis-associated biomarkers in saliva; a sensor device
that integrates multi-sensor modalities and the machine learning (ML) models will advance the clinical goal
of early diagnosis of periodontitis to enable earlier clinical interventions. Thus, we will develop and apply
three distinctive sensor modalities for detecting concentrations of salivary analytes relevant to various stages
of periodontal progression, i.e., inflammation, soft tissue destruction or bone destruction (Aim 1). Data from
both sensor outputs and clinical examination will be used to train ML models via a novel multi-modal
adversarial knowledge distillation ML framework, which promotes accurate early prediction with partial
longitudinal data representations (Aim 2). The multi-sensor modalities and the ML models will be embedded
in a single microfluidic device, incorporating steps such as sampling, detection, and data analysis as an
integrated lab-on-a-chip, and permitting the sensor data preprocessed to transmit only the actionable
information to the outside platform to protect the user's privacy (Aim 3). Such a device is anticipated to offer
for unobtrusive, accurate, and frequent saliva-based self-monitoring, and provide detailed medical data to
support clinical decisions. It will be an effective tool for future personalized medicine and dramatically
improve patients' oral health."
10915466,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Advances in synthetic biology will play a fundamental role in shaping the future of cancer diagnostics toward
earlier and more specific detection of disease. For example, whole-cell biosensors such as bacteria have been
genetically engineered to perform complex functions such as signal amplification to detect clinically relevant
biomarkers in human urine and serum. In mammalian cells, sense-and-respond components that employ
Boolean logic have been demonstrated for multiplexed control of engineered T cell therapies, thereby increasing
the specificity of tumor sensing and reducing systemic toxicity. These advances highlight the promise of synthetic
biology when applied to cancer, yet the vast majority of these strategies rely on genetic circuits and make use of
non-mammalian protein components. Such circuits are complex and raise safety and immunogenicity concerns
for regulatory approval, especially in the context of in vivo early cancer detection where repeated administrations
of biosensors are likely needed to monitor for nascent disease. This proposal seeks to develop a new class of
diagnostics called AND-gated synthetic biomarkers for early detection of cancer metastasis. Synthetic
biomarkers are an emerging class of activatable biological sensors that are designed to be administered
systemically, query sites of early disease, and harness tumor-dependent activation mechanisms, such as
dysregulated protease activity, to drive production of a reporter. These reporters can then be detected
noninvasively from blood, urine, or other bodily fluid samples. Proteases play key biological roles across the
major hallmarks of metastasis and are particularly potent molecular amplifiers by catalyzing the irreversible
hydrolysis of peptide bonds, allowing a single protease to turnover thousands of substrates. AND-gated synthetic
biomarkers will be applied for early detection of colorectal cancer (CRC) liver metastasis. Although the liver is a
common site for metastatic spread from primary CRC, regional resection of liver-isolated metastases can lead
to potentially curative results. Yet early detection of CRC liver metastases at a size when they are most
responsive to therapy (1–2 mm) remains challenging by radiographic imaging such as CT and FDA-approved
blood test such as the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) test. To design AND-gated synthetic biomarkers for CRC
liver metastasis, pairwise combinations of proteases will be selected based on differential RNA expression in
CRC liver metastases compared to healthy liver tissue. Multivariate mathematical models will be developed to
understand how design parameters enhance specificity and cooperativity compared to experimental results.
Syngeneic and xenograft models of CRC liver metastasis will be used for preclinical validation studies to allow
benchmarking against CT and CEA. This proposal will lay the groundwork for earlier detection of cancer
metastasis by programmable synthetic biomarkers."
10913443,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Insomnia is a debilitating condition that escalates risk of a myriad of disorders, and affects up to one third of
adults. Although insomnia can be effectively treated with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I),
there is a shortage of specialty providers trained in CBT-I. Consequently, most patients with insomnia are
unable to receive CBT-I as the recommended first-line intervention for insomnia. To address this problem,
CBT-I can now be delivered digitally (dCBT-I) with strong efficacy; however, the real-world effectiveness of
dCBT-I is limited by poor engagement. Over 50% of patients do not complete the full course of dCBT-I, and
40% of those who persist in treatment do not adhere to critical components of dCBT-I. Moreover, treatment
completion and adherence are 2-3 times worse in those with low socioeconomic status. Our pilot data indicate
that the disparity in completion and adherence to dCBT-I is related to low health literacy, defined as the ability
to find, understand, and use information and services to inform health-related decisions. Health literacy is
especially critical for engagement with digital interventions that are self-guided, such as dCBT-I.
 This proposal responds to an announcement focused on improving patient adherence to treatments. We
propose a large-scale intervention comparing enhanced dCBT-I to control dCBT-I in improving treatment
completion and adherence in a sample stratified by socioeconomic status. We also propose to test the effect of
enhanced dCBT-I on reducing socioeconomic disparities in treatment adherence and completion. An
innovative component of this trial is the use of non-specialist coaches as a scaffold for low health literacy, and
to enhance treatment motivation and self-efficacy. Furthermore, those who are at-risk for treatment non-
completion are shifted to telehealth coaching focused on one single critical behavioral component tailored for
ease of assimilation into the patient’s daily life. The adaptive component provides patients two different
treatment modalities to maximize engagement and both approaches leverage technology to increase
accessibility. Our long-term goal is to ensure equitable effectiveness of digital insomnia treatments. To that
end, our overall objective is to determine how adherence and completion in dCBT-I can be improved,
particularly in those with low SES as a health disparities population. Based on pilot data, our central hypothesis
is that, compared to control dCBT-I, enhanced dCBT-I will increase engagement by providing targeted support
for those who need it."

Despite growing recognition that diagnostic failures are the “new frontier” for patient safety research, there has
been no study to systematically examine diagnostic failures (delayed, wrong or missed diagnoses) in dentistry.
The primary goal of our proposal is to close this knowledge gap by systematically evaluating dental diagnostic
failures (DDFs) associated with periodontal diseases with a goal of moving the profession towards diagnostic
excellence. Periodontal (gum) diseases affect 46% of US adults and may often lead to pain, tooth loss, and/or
poor quality of life when not properly managed.
 This work is significant because it is the first attempt to systematically evaluate diagnostic performance
in dentistry. It is innovative because it utilizes a new methodology for mining EHR data to identify diagnostic
errors, and examines the association between diagnostic errors and clinical/health service outcomes. The
approach is grounded in our extensive preliminary work. The investigators are experienced researchers who
have pioneered patient safety research in dentistry and laid the foundation for a diagnostic-centered profession
through developing and disseminating the dental diagnostic terminology SNODDS that enables dentists to
accurately document patients' diagnoses within the EHR in a standardized manner. Our study will be
conducted at two academic institutions, which will provide a robust learning environment.
 In Aim 1, we determine the incidence of dental diagnostic failures (DDFs) associated with periodontal
diseases and conditions. This Aim seeks to assess the concordance between clinician-given diagnoses and
established diagnostic criteria from the American Academy of Periodontology (AAP) in order to determine the
baseline incidence of DDFs associated with periodontal diseases. Specifically, we will deploy automated query
scripts to extract critical data elements from the EHR that will be used to generate an EHR-based diagnosis for
comparison with the clinician-given diagnosis. All discordant cases will be reviewed independently by trained
site clinicians and collectively by the expert panel to confirm the presence or absence of a DDF.
 In Aim 2 we evaluate clinical and treatment patterns and clinical outcomes following DDFs. In this Aim,
we will examine the patterns of treatment received by patients following their periodontal diagnoses and their
periodontal health outcomes. We hypothesize that patients with inaccurate diagnoses (DDFs) will be more
likely to receive inappropriate treatment (over- or under-treatment) when compared against recommended
treatment guidelines. They will also have poorer clinical outcomes (e.g. progression of periodontal disease,
tooth loss) compared to those with accurate diagnoses (non-DDFs).
 We expect that our research will provide the dental profession with a fundamental understanding of
DDFs related to periodontal diseases and conditions. It will also provide a solid roadmap from which to develop
and implement DDF mitigation strategies that will prevent unnecessary harm to dental patients."
10908380,"Seasonal influenza epidemics are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and while prophylactic
immunization has proven the most efficient way to prevent influenza so far, current vaccines provide limited
protection against antigenically distinct influenza strains, notably those with pandemic and/or high pathogenic
potential. Therefore, innovative approaches to provide longer-lasting protection than currently licensed vaccines
and against a wider variety of influenza viruses is highly desirable. Mobilization of immune effector cells with
potent antiviral activity against conserved influenza antigens represents one strategy to enhance cross-
protection. Classically, Natural Killer (NK) cells are viewed as nonspecific effector cells of the innate immune
system that play critical roles in defense against viral infections, including influenza. Unexpectedly, for over a
decade, paradigms suggesting that immunological memory is exclusively mediated by T and B cells have been
challenged by several independent studies clearly demonstrating that subsets of murine, non-human primate
(NHP) and human NK cells are capable of adaptive immune functions, including antigen-specificity and recall
responses. Our new preliminary data now show for the first time that influenza-specific NK cells mediating potent
responses against conserved influenza antigens from serologically distinct strains exist in humans and provide
mechanistic evidence supporting a role for HLA-E and its activating ligand NKG2C in antigen-specific NK cell
responses. Collectively, these findings suggest that vaccine strategies that concomitantly enhance the breadth,
magnitude and cross-reactivity of influenza-specific memory NK cell, T cell and B cell responses might
significantly improve vaccine-induced cross-protective immunity. However, mechanisms underlying the
establishment and maintenance of true antigen-specific NK cell memory are largely undefined and protection
mediated by influenza-specific memory NK cells remain to be determined in primate species. In this study, we
propose to address the overarching hypothesis that MHC-E-restricted memory NK cells can mediate
heterosubtypic protection against influenza through three focused independent Aims: (i) Characterize
human influenza-specific memory NK cell responses; (ii) Assess influenza-specific memory NK cell-
mediated cross-protection in macaques; and (iii) Delineate MHC-E-restricted NK cell antigen specificity
against influenza. We expect these innovative studies to help develop universal influenza vaccines tailored to
mobilize influenza-specific memory NK cells."

measured by cardiopulmonary exercise or six minute walk testing. However, these artificial tests do not
capture the intensity, frequency, duration, context, and pattern of physical activity throughout the day or week
in the patient’s life. Such an activity “signature” or phenotype may more accurately reflect an individual’s
function and perceived health-related quality of life (HRQOL) by providing insight into multisystem function,
side effects, and treatment benefits and burdens. A physical activity intervention which is personalized for a
PAH patient could lead to improvements in psychosocial function, symptoms, HRQOL, fitness, and even
survival. Unfortunately, there have been very few published studies of physical activity in PAH patients, none of
which have assessed multidimensionality in a large multicenter cohort. We have performed preliminary studies
using traditional accelerometry which have shown that patients with PAH cluster into low, medium, and high
activity phenotypes which show differences in six minute walk distance and HRQOL. Functional principal
components analysis has identified “signatures” of physical activity patterns throughout the day in PAH. Novel
biosensors which continuously capture multiple streams of data in real time (including accelerometry) would
provide an innovative approach to remote clinical monitoring and may increase the efficiency and pertinence of
clinical trials in PAH.
 The Pulmonary Hypertension Association Registry (PHAR) has been prospectively collecting data from
adult and pediatric PAH patients from centers throughout the United States since 2015. The PHAR has
enrolled 1400 patients with 2000 patient-years of follow-up at 52 centers, representing one of the largest
multicenter registries of patients with PAH. We propose to measure accelerometry for one week periods
biannually for > 1400 patients over four years (~7000 assessments) in the PHAR with high efficiency and low
patient burden. We aim to determine the predictors of physical activity phenotype and whether physical activity
patterns are associated with health-related quality of life, emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and
time to lung transplantation or death in PAH. We will estimate the “minimally important difference” in physical
activity which could be used as an end point in clinical trials in PAH. We will incorporate a novel wearable
biosensor which could be used to advance these models of physical activity in PAH."
10913335,"Innate and Adaptive Immune Responses in the Pathogenesis of Glaucoma
Glaucoma is a globally unmet medical challenge and a leading cause of irreversible blindness. Elevated
intraocular pressure (IOP) is a major risk factor of glaucoma; yet, clinically it is neither required nor sufficient to
cause neuronal damage. The mechanisms underlying glaucomatous neurodegeneration are not fully understood.
Recently, we have provided the first convincing evidence demonstrating an immune mechanism underlying
neurodegeneration in glaucoma. We showed in both the inducible and inherited glaucomatous mouse models
that elevated IOP induced upregulation of heat shock proteins (HSPs), retinal microglial activation and T cell
infiltration/HSP-specific CD4+ T cell responses and that retinal immune responses are the driving force for
progressive RGC and axon degeneration in glaucoma. Remarkably, in germ free mice, which are deficient in
HSP-specific T cells, IOP elevation failed to induce microglial activation, HSP-specific T cell responses, and
glaucomatous neurodegeneration. These results strongly support that elevated IOP presents a physical stress
rather than direct damage to RGCs and axons; it is the stress-evoked events, likely involving both innate and
adaptive immune responses that cause glaucomatous neurodegeneration. The key unanswered questions are
how elevated IOP activates microglia and T cell responses to induce RGC and axon damage and what are the
molecular signals that induce microglial and T cell responses in glaucoma. HSP expression, especially when
released from the cell, is known to induce both innate and adaptive immune responses. We hypothesize that
elevated IOP induces HSP signaling, leading to microglial activation and HSP-specific T cell responses, which
in turn cause RGC degeneration in glaucoma. In the present application, we propose to critically test this
hypothesis from three complementary angles: 1) to determine if HSP signaling is responsible for initiating both
innate and adaptive immune responses in the retina and inducing glaucomatous neurodegeneration; 2) to
investigate if HSPs are key pathogenic antigens driving T cell responses in glaucoma; and 3) to test if levels of
HSP-specific T cells in the peripheral blood of patients with glaucoma can serve as biomarkers for diagnosis or
predication of glaucoma progression. The proposed studies will be carried out as a collaborative effort among
investigators and glaucoma specialist at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear and Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, who have complementary expertise and a long history of productive collaboration. Elucidation of
the immune mechanisms in glaucomatous neurodegeneration would lead to a paradigm shift in the
understanding of the disease pathogenesis and provide a basis for the development of mechanism-based
diagnosis, prevention and treatments. Given that the retina has long been served as a model for the central
nervous system, the proposed studies may also shed light on the pathogenesis of other neurodegenerative
disorders afflicting the brain and spinal cord."

Two-thirds (67%) of family caregivers to persons living with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias
(AD/ADRD) provide complex care tasks, such as medical/nursing tasks (e.g., managing medications, transferring
from bed to chair, managing swallowing difficulties). Yet, only 53% of AD/ADRD caregivers receive any training
to prepare them to conduct complex care. Consequently, AD/ADRD caregivers experience high levels of worry
about making a mistake. Most responses to caregivers’ need for complex care training are not specific to
AD/ADRD caregivers, though complex care is exponentially more challenging in the context of AD/ADRD.
Provision of complex care to this population is complicated by the presence of behavioral symptoms of dementia
(BPSD), difficulty with communication due to cognitive changes, and greater likelihood of multimorbidity than
found amongst cognitively intact older adult care recipients. Another limitation of current responses to caregivers’
need for complex care training is current resources do not fully integrate principles of psychoeducation known to
be effective at improving caregiver self-efficacy. High levels of self-efficacy, a person’s belief in their ability to
accomplish a specific task, are associated with more positive perceptions of caregiving (e.g., meaningfulness),
while low self-efficacy contributes to emotional distress, including depression. To build caregivers’ self-efficacy
in the performance on complex care, Learning Skills Together (LST) was developed in 2017 at the UT Health
San Antonio Caring for the Caregiver program by a multidisciplinary team with expertise in nursing, occupational
therapy, speech-language pathology, nutrition, dental hygiene, and gerontology. In its most recent rendition, LST
was delivered online over 4 synchronous videoconferencing sessions and program content integrated principles
of Self-Efficacy Theory, such as peer-learning, modeling, and assignments so caregivers could practice skills
and access feedback. In a single-arm pre- and post-test pilot study of LST, we observed statistically significant
increases in self-efficacy at 4-weeks post-intervention (p=0.003). Near significant effects persisted 8-weeks post-
intervention (p=0.057). To rigorously test the efficacy of participation in LST on caregiver self-efficacy, we
propose to test the hypothesis that caregivers to persons living with mid-stage AD/ADRD who participate in LST
will report greater improvements in self-efficacy compared to a randomized active control group (N=200). We
will also test for secondary outcomes we anticipate will be affected by improvements in self-efficacy, including
caregiver depression and appraisal of BPSD. Subgroup analyses will be conducted with African American/Black,
Latinx, and women caregivers; race, ethnicity, and gender will be tested as intervention effect modifiers given
prior research demonstrating differences in the effects of self-efficacy intervention according to these
characteristics. If findings demonstrate the efficacy of Learning Skills Together, the next step will be to examine
effectiveness when delivering this program in community settings (e.g., Area Agencies on Aging)."
10904964,"Project Summary
 Rates of opioid use during pregnancy are at epidemic proportions. Infants exposed to opioids before
birth frequently develop neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) and are at a much higher risk of
sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). A major knowledge gap is that it not currently possible to determine
the magnitude of NOWS or SIDS risk in opioid-exposed infants. Most infants with antenatal opioid exposure
are observed for several days after birth in the hospital to determine if the infant develops NOWS. Infants who
develop NOWS are frequently managed using the Finnegan scoring system which is complex and subjective.
There is therefore a need for rapid objective and quantitative measurement of signs of opioid withdrawal.
There is a critical need to determine if the hospital course of NOWS or abnormalities in respiratory control can
be predicted soon after birth, in order to initiate earlier monitoring or therapy. Furthermore, it is essential to be
able to adjust therapy in a more evidence-based manner.
 The overall objective of the Vital Signs In Opioid-exposed Neonates (ViSION) project is to use
cardiorespiratory dynamics (characteristics and patterns of heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturations)
soon after birth from the existing large cohort of opioid-exposed newborns (>140/yr) at the University of
Alabama at Birmingham to develop and validate mathematical models to predict (a) onset of NOWS, (b)
changes in magnitude of NOWS as estimated by Finnegan scoring, and (c) abnormal polysomnographic
(sleep) study at three months of age. The central hypothesis of this proposed study is that cardiorespiratory
dynamics improve detection of NOWS onset and severity, and can predict infants with sleep disordered
breathing before discharge. The Specific Aims are:
Specific Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that cardiorespiratory dynamics soon after birth identify opioid-exposed
neonates at higher risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome. This hypothesis will be tested in a
prospective cohort of 200 opioid-exposed newborn infants and 100 healthy control infants.
Specific Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that cardiorespiratory dynamics of infants diagnosed with neonatal
opioid withdrawal syndrome track temporally with clinical assessment by the Finnegan scoring. This
hypothesis will be tested in a prospective cohort of 100 newborn infants diagnosed with neonatal opioid
withdrawal syndrome.
Specific Aim 3: Test the hypothesis that intermittent hypoxemia and bradycardia events soon after birth are
associated with apnea-hypopnea index on polysomnographic studies at three months of age. This hypothesis
will be tested in a prospective cohort of 60 newborn infants diagnosed with NOWS, 60 opioid-exposed infants
without NOWS, and 60 healthy control infants."
10917204,"Most cancer patients die as a result of metastatic disease and our inability to effectively deliver therapeutic drugs into the
anatomical niches where cancer cells thrive. Thus, there is a major unmet need to develop therapeutic strategies that
effectively target cancer cells in the local tumor microenvironment (TME) while minimizing peripheral toxicity. Cytonus
Therapeutics and UCSD Moores Cancer Center has co-developed a highly innovative first-in-class drug transporter platform
(CargocytesTM) that is a safe and effective means to deliver therapeutic drugs to treat primary and secondary tumors.
Cargocytes possess several unique features that we leverage for precision delivery of cancer therapeutics to patients with
metastatic disease. First, Cargocytes possess innate tumor trophic properties and are engineered with additional homing
controls that allow for precise, predictable, and safe delivery of therapeutic cargo to the TME. Moreover, because they lack
a rigid nucleus, they clear critical FDA barriers to safety due to their inability to transfer or inappropriately express genomic
DNA. In addition, they are smaller and more malleable than nucleated carriers and better able to penetrate deep within
tumor tissue and metastatic foci. Furthermore, they retain all biosynthetic machinery and can express biological cargo within
the TME. While Cargocytes can deliver a wide range of therapeutic cargoes, they are ideally suited for locally delivering
potent immune activating agents, such as IL-12, into the immunologically “cold” TME.
Our phase I proof-of-concept work shows that Cargocytes precisely deliver IL-12 into the TME, deeply penetrating and
interdigitating within metastatic foci when delivered intratumorally or systemically and resulting in a dramatic reduction in
metastatic burden that can be measured within 24 hours. While this was demonstrated using Cargocytes that secrete IL-12
(CA-IL-12), we have since focused on development of Cargocytes for intravenous delivery, a more desirable administration
route for clinical development and treatment of systemic metastatic disease. Therefore, Phase II work will evaluate the
potential of intravenously administered Cargocytes to deliver secreted (CA-IL-12) or surface contained (CA-scIL-12) to
breast cancers that have metastasized to lungs or liver. Our hypothesis is that Cargocytes will home to metastases, deliver
IL-12 deep within disease foci, and break immune tolerance when used in combination with ICB. This will lead to i) local
and systemic antitumor immunity, ii) a reduction in metastatic burden, iii) improved tumor-free and overall survival, and
iv) durable antitumor immunity. Three specific aims are outlined to test this hypothesis. Aim 1 will determine the abilities
of peripherally administered CA-scIL-12 and CA-IL-12 to locally deliver IL-12 to primary and secondary tumors and to
reprogram innate and adaptive anti-tumor immune responses. Aim 2 will then evaluate the ability of our lead CA-IL-12
medicine selected in aim 1 (CA-IL-12L) in combination with PD-1 antibody in the adjuvant setting to effectively treat ICB
refractory tumors and generate systemic antitumor and antimetastatic immunity. Aim 3 will test the therapeutic efficacy of
CA-IL-12L and ICB in a robust preclinical model of spontaneous breast oncogenesis that preserves tumor heterogeneity."
10804742,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Cancer-induced skeletal muscle atrophy is a central and defining feature of the cancer cachexia syndrome, a
highly prevalent condition that affects over 50% of patients with advanced cancer and over 500,000 patients
per year in the U.S. In addition to being highly prevalent, cancer-induced skeletal muscle atrophy has
devastating consequences for patients; it reduces physical function and quality of life, often complicates or
precludes cancer treatment, and strongly predicts early mortality from cancer. Unfortunately, a pharmacologic
therapy for cancer-induced muscle atrophy does not exist. Thus, cancer-induced skeletal muscle atrophy
represents a highly significant unmet medical need with broad relevance to cancer patients. A major goal of
Emmyon, Inc. is to discover and develop a pharmacologic therapy for cancer-induced skeletal muscle
atrophy. To that end, we recently discovered a natural compound that significantly reduces cancer-induced
muscle atrophy in five well-established and distinct in vivo mouse models of cancer. We then used that natural
compound as a lead in medicinal chemistry program and discovered and patented a confidential and
proprietary chemical derivative (EMMY1-06) that appears to be significantly more potent and more efficacious
than the lead compound in at least two distinct mouse models of cancer-induced muscle atrophy. In this
Phase II SBIR proposal, we seek to continue this exciting work by advancing the development of
EMMY1-06 and related molecules as pharmaceuticals for cancer-induced skeletal muscle atrophy.
Specifically, we will further investigate EMMY1-06's safety, efficacy, and mechanisms of action in several
distinct and complementary mouse models of cancer-induced muscle atrophy that involve multiple tumor types,
sexes, and ages; these studies will significantly advance EMMY1-06 towards clinical development and
commercialization in SBIR Phase III. In parallel to our detailed studies of EMMY1-06, we will also design,
synthesize, and characterize novel compounds that are structurally related to EMMY1-06, seeking to discover
additional compounds with pharmacologic properties that are similar to or perhaps even better than those of
EMMY1-06 in preclinical models of cancer-induced muscle atrophy. Together, these studies will rigorously
advance the scientific understanding and commercial development of a highly promising new class of
pharmaceutical agents. Through this work, we hope to ultimately discover and develop a new
pharmacologic therapy that could broadly improve clinical outcomes for millions of patients who
suffer from cancer."
10912739,"SUMMARY- PROJECT 4 - Fork Repair: Mechanisms and consequences of stalled replication fork
processing
DNA replication is central to cancer etiology and treatment since errors during replication generate most cancer
driver mutations, and many cancer treatments including PARP inhibitors and chemotherapeutic agents target
DNA replication. We aim to discover the mechanisms of replication-coupled DNA repair and tolerance that are
important for tumorigenesis and development of new therapeutics. The premise of this application is that ATP-
dependent motor proteins act in pathways to control replication fork remodeling as a mechanism of replication
stress tolerance and error avoidance. In order to overcome challenge, intermediates in these pathways are
shunted towards alternative mechanisms, including translesion synthesis and repriming. The mechanism
deployed may depend on the type of challenge, its persistence, and the inactivation of selected replication stress
response and repair proteins that are common in cancer. While ensuring replication is completed, the use of
error-prone mechanisms can generate the genetic alterations that drive tumor development and drug resistance.
This genetic instability may also provide new opportunities for therapeutic intervention through synthetic lethal
approaches. This project will answer fundamental questions about these replication stress response
mechanisms using a combination of structural, biochemical, genetic, and cell biology approaches. Specifically,
we will determine how ATP-dependent fork reversal enzymes control replication fork dynamics, identify the
mechanisms that regulate replication stress tolerance pathways, and determine the consequences of damage
tolerance and fork repair pathways for genome stability. These aims will be accomplished by the combined efforts
of four investigators with expertise in cell biology, genetics, biochemistry, biophysics, and structural biology and
a history of working in cooperation with each other and with the other project investigators and research cores."
10930882,"Project Summary - Project 3
The loss of midbrain dopamine neurons in Parkinson’s disease (PD) induces complex anatomical and functional
changes throughout the basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuitry and downstream targets. Although our
understanding of neuronal activity changes in basal ganglia output nuclei and the subthalamic nucleus has
increased significantly over the past decade, much remains to be known about the pathophysiology of the
corticospinal system in the parkinsonian state. In this project, we provide strong preliminary evidence that there
is a significant breakdown of the thalamocortical system and major changes in the morphology of pyramidal cells
in the primary motor cortex (M1) and supplementary motor area (SMA) of monkeys that have been rendered
parkinsonian with chronic administration of the neurotoxin MPTP. Combined with findings from the literature
suggesting that corticospinal neurons display abnormal activity in M1 of MPTP-treated parkinsonian monkeys,
one of the hypotheses of our project is that corticospinal neurons in M1 and SMA undergo complex structural
and morphological changes that hamper their synaptic connectivity with the thalamocortical afferents, thereby
contributing to the dysregulation of functional connectivity between basal ganglia and motor cortices in
parkinsonism. Another major roadblock that significantly limited progress in our understanding of the
pathophysiology of motor cortices and the corticospinal system in PD has been the lack of reliable tools to study
the full connectome of corticospinal neurons. Although conventional tracing studies have demonstrated that both
M1 and SMA are enriched in a large variety of overlapping projection neurons that innervate a wide array of
basal ganglia, thalamic, brainstem and spinal cord regions, the extent to which these projections originate from
distinct or common neuronal populations remains largely unknown, or relies on data gathered from small
samples of identified pyramidal neurons. In this project, we will take advantage of the unique and highly efficient
retrograde transport properties of a newly developed designer variant of adeno-associated virus to map and
compare the connectome of corticospinal neurons between control and parkinsonian monkeys. Because the
behavioral functions of specific subtypes of corticofugal neurons derive from their complex output projection
patterns, not just their final termination site, an in-depth knowledge of the axonal branching pattern of
corticospinal axons in normal and parkinsonian states is of utmost significance in our understanding of the
pathophysiology of cortical outflow in Parkinson’s disease. Together with functional studies proposed in the other
projects of this application, our findings will lay the foundation for the development of new therapeutic
approaches, such as chemogenetic methods, to directly manipulate the activity of specific subsets of
corticospinal neurons in PD."

10930888,"Project Summary – Project 4
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is associated with behavioral impulsivity and deficits in motor control which result in
an inability to cancel planned actions or stop ongoing movements. These behaviors are affected by deep brain
stimulation (DBS) and levodopa treatment. The prefrontal cortex and its connections to the subthalamic nucleus
(STN), the main target of DBS therapy for PD, have been implicated in the control of these ‘response inhibition’
functions. It has been proposed that modulation of prefrontal-STN connections by DBS can change response
inhibition behavior, but clinical studies of this interaction have been conflicting, and clinical programming of DBS
devices continues to focus on the optimization of the motoric outcome of DBS, with little attention to the potential
changes in cognition and behavior which may result from DBS. The effects of dopaminergic medications on
motor response inhibition are also not well understood. While large-scale changes such as outright compulsive
disorders are often recognized, more subtle shifts in behavior are not usually acknowledged. The proposed
experiments will study the pathophysiologic underpinning of response inhibition abnormalities in PD, asking
which cortical mechanisms are engaged in different aspects of motor inhibitory control (proactive vs reactive;
discrete vs continuous) in patients off and on levodopa therapy, compared to healthy controls, and examine
whether the effects of STN DBS on response inhibition correlates with the degree of activation of the prefrontal
cortico-STN pathway. We will use invasive and non-invasive electrophysiology methods, as well as computa-
tional modeling. We will study patients longitudinally (before, during and after DBS procedures) and measure
their performance and cortical activity while they perform two response inhibition tasks. We will define the degree
of prefrontal cortico-STN pathway activation by different stimulation settings, using both direct electrophysiologic
recordings (subcortico-cortical evoked potentials) and state-of-the-art computational biophysical models. We will
also study how behavior and the underlying electrophysiologic activity change with levodopa treatment, and how
these alterations relate to the results of standard clinical neuropsychological tests. In addition to the PD patients,
we will study control subjects to understand to what extent changes in PD differ from healthy behavior and
physiology. We hypothesize that the stimulation location and the extent of stimulation field produced by STN-
DBS determine the degree of prefrontal cortex engagement and impact the patient’s ability to inhibit actions. We
postulate that by developing a detailed understanding of how these changes arise, both locally and throughout
the cognitive and motor networks, we can design stimulation strategies that maximize motor benefit and minimize
negative behavioral side effects of DBS. Successful completion of the proposed studies will thus inform DBS
targeting and programming strategies. The proposed Catalyst clinical study will synergize with the other Udall
Center components by focusing on cortical electrophysiology and exploring cortical-subcortical interactions that
lead to motor/cognitive dysfunction in PD, specifically as it relates to STN-DBS."

Translation of mRNAs by ribosomes is an essential process in all living cells, and it is frequently dysregulated
in many cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. The initiation stage of translation is usually thought of as the
major point for regulation of protein expression and mRNA stability. However, we and others have recently char-
acterized a critical and multi-faceted role for the elongation stage of translation in regulation of gene expression.
During our last funding period, we identiߑed a novel role for synonymous codon usage in regulating elongation rate
and protein expression from mammalian mRNAs during amino acid limitation. Our studies of synonymous codon
effects led to the major discovery that collisions between multiple ribosomes serve as a signal for cells to recog-
nize and rescue stalled ribosomes. Furthermore, we observed that high initiation rates counter-intuitively decrease
protein expression and stability of mRNAs undergoing ribosome collisions. Emerging from these advances is a
role for the mRNA as a dynamic platform for multi-factorial interactions between large macromolecular complexes
during translation. In the next project period, we will dissect such interactions that occur between elongating ri-
bosomes, initiating ribosomes, and mRNA decay factors. The goal of these studies will be to comprehensively
deߑne the set of ribosome-mediated interactions that are important for accurate prediction of gene expression in
the speciߑc contexts of mRNA turnover, short upstream open reading frames, and ribosomopathies. Towards this
goal, we will leverage our unique interdisciplinary approach combining quantitative high throughput experiments
with computational kinetic models. Successful completion of our research will provide a mechanistic framework
to predict the cellular consequences of disease-associated mutations in ribosomes and mRNA decay factors, as
well as in noncoding and synonymous sites of speciߑc mRNAs."
10916290,"Summary/Abstract
The use of antibiotics has significantly increased in recent years. Antibiotics (ABX) severely alter the
gut microbiome, destroying potentially pathogenic bacteria, as well as beneficial ones—producing a
state of microbial imbalance called dysbiosis. Notably, a diminished gut microbiome has severe defects on
the immune system, yet how these defects may affect cellular immunotherapy is largely unknown.
 To better understand how dysbiosis influences cellular immunotherapy, we focused on melanoma as
an exemplary immunogenic solid tumor. The incidence of melanoma has increased drastically over the
past decades, with its morbidity rate continuing to outpace that of most other cancers. Early stages of
melanoma are often successfully controlled and treated; yet patients with advanced stages of melanoma are
treated with cellular immunotherapy and only 50% respond. We hypothesize that ABX-induced dysbiosis
dictates, at least in part, the reduction in treatment efficacy.
 Our overall goal is to define the systemic effects of antibiotic-induced dysbiosis on the distal
tumor microenvironment and develop therapies to promote antitumor immunity. The major
objective of this application is to overcome dysbiosis-induced ICAM-1 suppression and thereby enhance
the effectiveness of cellular immunotherapy. Attaining this objective will be the next step in increasing the
efficacy and response rate of immunotherapies. We formulated a robust and unbiased approach using
various melanoma models to accomplish the following Aims:
Aim 1. Identify ABX primarily responsible for stromal immune suppression resulting in tumor progression.
Aim 2. Increase ICAM-1 on tumor-associated endothelial cells during dysbiosis.
Aim 3. Increase cellular immunotherapy efficacy in melanoma during dysbiosis.
 Completing these aims will expand our understanding on how antibiotics-induced perturbation of the
gut microbiome impacts the distal tumor microenvironment. This work has the potential to establish new
paradigms aimed at enhancing the efficacy and response rate of immunotherapies by modulating the
tumor vasculature, as all types of immunotherapy ultimately dependent on efficient trafficking of effector
leukocytes into the tumor."
10829454,"Abstract:
Selective degeneration of midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons in the substantia nigra and abnormal
accumulation and aggregation of -synuclein in Lewy bodies are hallmark pathological features of Parkinson’s
disease (PD). Currently, available treatments are symptomatic and there is no treatment that can halt or slow
down the disease progression. Based on extensive studies on transcriptional regulation of mDA neurons from
this and other laboratories, the orphan nuclear receptor Nurr1 (also known as NR4A2) has emerged as a master
regulator of mDA neurons and a promising target for therapeutic development in PD. Although Nurr1 has been
considered a ligand-independent, constitutively active transcription factor, we identified both synthetic
(amodiaquine, chloroquine, and glafenine) and endogenous ligands (prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) and PGA1), which
directly interact with the ligand binding domain (LBD) of Nurr1 and activate its transcription function with distinct
mechanisms. Furthermore, our preliminary data showed that Nurr1 expression is significantly compromised by
both prolonged exposure to neurotoxin and overexpression of -synuclein. Based on these results, we
hypothesize that Nurr1 is an “adopted” nuclear receptor whose transcriptional function is significantly modulated
by both synthetic and native ligands and that there is functional crosstalk between Nurr1 and PD risk factors. To
address these hypotheses, we propose to investigate the following questions. First, we will address whether
there exist additional endogenous ligands in the brain and will investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms
how these novel ligands regulate Nurr1’s transcriptional function by identifying its coregulators and delineating
their structure-activity relationships. Second, we will investigate whether there is crosstalk between Nurr1 and
PD risk factors such as -synuclein and how Nurr1’s ligands regulate this crosstalk. Third, using in vivo models
of PD, we will systematically investigate whether Nurr1’s optimal synthetic and/or endogenous ligands can
provide mechanism-based neuroprotection for eventual application as novel therapeutics for PD. If successful,
these studies will advance our understanding of Nurr1’s function and regulation by its ligands in health and
disease, and address whether Nurr1 can be a “druggable” target for PD."

Vascular access is the most common medical procedure in the world, with over a billion insertions performed
annually. In the United States, over 350-million peripheral intravenous (IV) catheters are sold yearly, in addition
to millions of central and arterial lines. However, peripheral IV placement often requires several attempts at
insertion, which is painful and time consuming. Furthermore, there is a high rate of early failure that can lead to
further complications, including extravasation, thrombophlebitis, and compartment syndrome, as well as delays
in delivery of therapeutic medications. Ultrasound guided vascular access is widespread and has advanced
difficult IV access success rates, but there is clearly room for improvement as the success rate for ultrasound
guided peripheral IV placement is stagnant at 80%. Improving the success rate for vascular access will have a
huge impact on patient care and patient safety.
 To address the clinical need described above and overcome the current technical challenges, we have
pioneered a novel concept of ‘active acoustic communication’ between needle and imaging systems for
guidance. We are further evolving the concept into a clinical prototype that is intuitive and easy to use, low cost,
disposable, works with any ultrasound vendor, offers easy needle tip tracking, and differentiates between tissue
types. A ‘5T (tool tip tracking + tissue typing)-IV’ guidance platform will offer an integrated interface layer for
clinicians, providing (1) high-spatiotemporal resolution (sub-millimeter and sub-second) tool tip tracking over a
wide field-of-view, (2) encoded contrast with a flashing active echo pulse to visualize the needle tip, and (3)
highly accurate tissue typing at the needle tip with (4) an unaltered clinical workflow. In this project, we will first
develop a vendor-independent clinical prototype hardware and software package with comprehensive
performance characterizations in tissue-mimicking phantoms, and this will guide further iteration of the form-
factor and software user interface included in the clinical prototype to be tested in animals. The efficacy and
user experience will be extensively evaluated in preclinical phantom models by performing human factor studies
with 65 end users. Quantifiable metrics (e.g., success rate, time duration and number of trials) will be compared
between conventional US and the 5T-IV guidance methods will be expanded to swine animal models for both

 Protein phosphorylation defines one of the most important and pervasive regulatory mechanisms in cell
signaling. A precise control of the balance between phosphorylation and dephosphorylation is crucial for living
organisms to maintain normal physiological functions. While protein kinases have attracted a significant amount
of attention given the promise of developing inhibitors for targeted therapies, significant knowledge gaps exist
on the opposing actions of protein phosphatases. The overall objective of this study is to investigate the
molecular mechanisms by which PTPRF, a receptor-type tyrosine phosphatase, regulates Wnt signaling and
normal intestinal homeostasis. A large body of evidence indicates that Wnt signaling is required for the
maintenance of normal intestinal stem cells; and dysregulation of Wnt signaling is often the first step leading to
the development of colorectal cancer. In our efforts to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of Wnt signaling,
we identified PTPRF, a receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase, as a novel positive regulator in the Wnt pathway
that promotes the activation of Wnt signaling upstream of the β-catenin destruction complex. To further determine
the functional importance of PTPRF, we utilized Ptprf knockout mice to investigate if Ptprf-loss alters Wnt
signaling and the proliferation and differentiation of intestinal stem cells in vivo. Our exciting new data showed
that intestinal crypts isolated from Ptprf knockout mice have reduced ability to form organoids, which coincides
with decreased expression of Wnt target genes. In addition, we found that PTPRF interacts and co-localizes with
LRP6 and caveolin upon Wnt stimulation; and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of PTPRF in 293T cells
attenuates Wnt-stimulated TOP-Flash reporter activity as well as LRP6 phosphorylation. Moreover, we identified
NEDD4L as a novel E3 ligase that controls PTPRF ubiquitination and degradation. Collectively, the central
hypothesis driving this proposal is that that PTPRF positively regulates Wnt signaling by promoting the
formation of Wnt signalosome and the expression of PTPRF sustains intestinal stem cell function. The following
specific aims are proposed: 1) to delineate the molecular mechanisms underlying PTPRF-mediated regulation
of Wnt signaling; 2) to determine the role of NEDD4L in controlling PTPRF protein stability; and 3) to define the
functional importance of PTPRF in regulating the proliferation and differentiation of intestinal stem cells in vivo.
Results from our studies will fill an important knowledge gap on how protein phosphatases are involved in
regulating complex biological processes. To ensure the success of this study, we have assembled a strong
investigative team with collective expertise in protein phosphatases, Wnt signaling and intestinal epithelial cell
biology. Ultimately, by providing new mechanistic insights into PTPRF-dependent regulation of Wnt signaling,
our findings will help identify new strategies for treating Wnt-driven diseases by using PTPRF as a target."
10841392,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Epigenetic regulation is critical for cardiac electromechanics and pathology. Epigenetic modulators, such as
histone deacetylases (HDACs), are known master regulators of gene expression and influence cardiac function
through chromatin remodeling, direct action on transcription factors (TFs), and action on cytoskeletal and
contractile proteins, among others. Recently, novel pharmacological agents, HDAC inhibitors, have been
developed as treatments for cancer and immune diseases, driving an interest in robust characterization of HDAC
control in cardiac function. Our preliminary experiments focused on computational modeling of RNAi-informed
transcriptomic data in human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CM) but saw
limitations in knockdown efficiency and loss-of-function-only modulation using siRNAs. To extend and improve
this work, we propose an experimental approach based on bidirectional perturbation (repression/activation) of
individual HDAC genes in hiPSC-CM by CRISPR interference and activation (CRISPRi/a). Transcriptomic
analysis of these samples will inform computational gene regulatory network (GRN) inference to model
relationships between HDACs, TFs, and cardiac ion channels. GRN-predicted relationships will be validated by
all-optical electromechanical assays measuring voltage, calcium, and contraction traces in hiPSC-CM. An
iterative approach will allow feedback from functional experiments to refine our computational models. Such
studies will advance our understanding of how certain HDACs drive electrophysiological phenotypes in the heart,
which is critical in the fields of cardiac injury, cardiac therapeutics, and cardio-oncology."
10912585,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Background: Gender minority youth (GMY; children, adolescents, and young adults whose gender identity differs from
their birth-assigned sex) face a disproportionately high risk for serious mental health problems relative to cisgender youth
(whose gender identity is congruent with their birth-assigned sex). These mental health inequities are exacerbated by
treatment utilization barriers, including the dearth of mental health providers trained in gender-affirming care (i.e., practices
that address the distinct experiences and mental health needs of gender minorities). The NIH and numerous scholars have
called for increased efforts to develop and deploy interventions that improve access to, engagement in, and quality of, mental
health interventions for gender minorities. Research: The proposed research will develop and pilot test a training
intervention to increase mental health providers’ use of gender-affirming practices. Intervention design (Aim 1) will utilize
community-engaged and user-centered design methods, with systematic engagement from key stakeholders: GMY, their
caregivers, as well as providers with and without expertise in gender-affirming care. Using an empirically-supported
framework for behavioral intervention development, the intervention will be designed to affect three mechanisms
hypothesized to result in behavioral change in providers (i.e., increased use of gender-affirming practices): knowledge,
attitudes, and self-efficacy. Scalability of the intervention will be emphasized through the integration of mHealth
technology. Intervention refinement (Aim 2) will involve two phases of user-centered design usability testing: (1) lab-based
testing with focus groups of providers and (2) a case series study with 3 providers treating GMY consumers for 3 months.
Feedback from usability testing will be used to iteratively refine the intervention and ensure the intervention’s readiness for
pilot testing. The pilot test (Aim 3) will be an open trial in a multi-clinic mental health agency, aimed at examining the
feasibility and acceptability of conducting a future RCT. Effectiveness and implementation data from both providers (N =
44) and consumers (i.e., GMY and their caregivers; N = 50 GMY) will be collected and analyzed. Candidate’s Career
Development, Goals, and Environment: The proposed Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award
(K23) will provide Dr. Price with the advanced training and skills necessary to launch an independent research program
focused on reducing mental health inequities for stigmatized youth and families through developing and evaluating training
interventions, with an emphasis on GMY. Formal training and mentorship in (T1) mechanism-driven intervention
development and testing, (T2) user-centered design, (T3) community-engaged research, and (T4) implementation science
will support the successful execution of the primary research aims and Dr. Price’s career development. The immense
resources available at Boston College, coupled with the vast expertise of Dr. Price’s mentorship and advisory team members,
will further ensure the success of the research and training aims, and pave the way for a future RCT of the training
intervention."
10929971,"Significance: The ability to measure the molecular mechanisms of neuronal communication at the nanometer
spatial scale will have enormous impact on basic bioscience and likely to future clinical neuroscience. In
particular, AMPA- and NMDA-type glutamate receptors (known as iGluRs) are dynamically involved in neuron-
to-neuron communication across the thin (≈30 nm) synapse; when dysregulated, neurodegenerative diseases
result, such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. We—and others—have tracked these events with
nanometric resolution using super-resolution fluorescence microscopy (SRFM). Using small probes—quantum
dots (≈12 nm diameter) and other photostable fluorophores, developed in our lab in the preceding grant—we
came up with some surprises. We find that a large fraction of the AMPARs reside in the synapse where their
mobility is restricted; during long-term-potentiation (LTP, a molecular underpinning of memory formation), we’ve
quantified their numbers and find during their maintenance phase that their lateral diffusion is rare; NMDARs
have extra-synaptic nanodomains which may keep their numbers from rising during LTP. But are these, and
other results, correct? To validate these preliminary results, we will measure the placement and diffusion of the
iGluRs, primarily AMPARs, using three different SRFM techniques, each one having its own advantages and
disadvantages. We will also determine the 3D-orientation of the synapse, the effect of probe size and type, the
details of LTP activation, and quantitatively determine the number of iGluRs at each synapse. The results
between the three techniques will be compared.
Innovation: Each SRFM technique has new aspects, particularly with respect to neuroscience. First, we will
improve the PALM/STORM technique (one type of SRFM) to test the distribution and dynamics of iGluRs more
accurately. We will use new probes—nanobodies and scFv’s—against post-synaptic proteins and iGluRs, and
test new sQDs and new cross-linking reagents against iGluRs. We will also determine the orientation and position
of the synaptic zone by labeling neuroligin and various presynaptic proteins, such as Bassoon and RIM1/2, first
under basal conditions and then with chemical LTP (cLTP). Second, we will use and develop PAINT, another
form of SRFM, which has recently been shown to have a 100× increase in speed with excellent spatial
resolution—≈5 nanometers in 0.2 sec. We will show that quantitative-PAINT can be applied to fixed neurons
and can be used to measure cLTP on an individual synapse. And for the first time, we will apply PAINT to a living
neuron under physiological conditions to measure AMPAR dynamics. With PAINT, we will be able to test how
many iGluRs there are per synapse, whether they are synaptic or extra-synaptic, and how the number of iGluRs
change with cLTP. Third, we will utilize a fluorogenic activating protein (FAP) with iGluRs and show that the
number of receptors can be measured in living neurons with nanometric resolution, no background, and
potentially fast response to cLTP. This method will therefore provide another test of iGluR structure & dynamics."

10919878,"Project Summary/Abstract – Addressing Social and Behavioral Determinants of Health Core
Social determinants of health (SDOHs), defined as the conditions in the environments in which people are
born, live, learn, work, play, worship, and age, are major drivers of diabetes-related morbidity, mortality, and
disparities. Health behaviors such as care-seeking decisions, medication adherence, self management, diet,
and physical activity are also key factors that influence diabetes-related outcomes. In addition, these
behavioral factors can be important mediators of the deleterious effects of SDOHs on diabetes-related
outcomes, limiting the real world impact of medical and public health advances in diabetes prevention and
treatment and further contributing to population health disparities. Despite growing recognition of the
importance of socio-ecological, economic, and behavioral influences on the prevention and treatment of
diabetes, and their contribution to inequities in diabetes-related outcomes, much remains unknown about the
most effective ways to address these influences to improve outcomes and eliminate disparities. Closing this
gap in knowledge will require cross-disciplinary expertise in a broad range of social and behavioral
determinants of health, experience with and access to strong cross-sector partnerships, and dissemination of
novel research to key stakeholders who can implement, sustain, and disseminate findings. The Addressing
Social and Behavioral Determinants of Health Core will catalyze state-of-the-art approaches to address socio-
ecological, economic, and behavioral determinants of health in order to eliminate inequities in diabetes
prevention and treatment. The Core will support Center investigators and trainees with measuring and
intervening on social and behavioral determinants of health among diverse patient populations in a range of
community and health care settings. This Core will have a particular focus on developing novel interventions
that screen for and modify SDOHs, leverage insights from behavioral economics and other behavioral science
frameworks, support culturally competent behavior change among diverse patient populations, and address
the health consequences of individual, interpersonal, and structural racism. This Core has four Specific Aims:
Aim 1. Support state-of-the-art translational research to address socio-ecological, economic, and behavioral
determinants of health in order to eliminate inequities in diabetes prevention and treatment. Aim 2. Integrate
rigorous measurement of socio-ecological, economic, and behavioral determinants of health into translational
diabetes research. Aim 3. Catalyze new collaborations to address socio-ecological, economic, and behavioral
determinants of health in translational diabetes research. Aim 4. Develop early career investigators who will
measure and target socio-ecological, economic, and behavioral determinants of health in translational diabetes
research. Our multidisciplinary focus, breadth, and depth of expertise in the social and behavioral determinants
of health in this Core position us well to catalyze a pipeline of innovative diabetes translational research to
improve outcomes and ameliorate the conditions that result in diabetes disparities."
10919880,"Project Summary/Abstract - Leveraging Community, Peer, and Family Support Core
This Core facilitates research on and the development and evaluation of interventions addressing community,
peer, and family support. We define community as the overarching ecosystem through which family and peer
support is leveraged. Families and peers are defined broadly to include biological kin and individuals who
comprise current and potential new social networks. These may consist of colleagues, neighbors, participants
in a group medical visit, members of a virtual community, and even well-designed apps. Thus, this Core
emphasizes a) the exchanges within and between communities, families, and peers (i.e., overlap); b) the
characteristics and processes they share (i.e., interact); and c) the reciprocal association between their
influence and their contexts – culture, disease characteristics, stage of life, etc. (i.e., function). The Core will
support studies into these topics, including interventions anchored in communities and health care systems
that utilize community, peer, or family influences, broadly defined. To improve the design, implementation, and
evaluation of interventions, this Core will also support studies exploring community, peer, and family support
paths and how different contexts shape them.
The Core’s work is highly pertinent to the Center’s emphasis on anti-racism and health equity. It is important to
consider how communities, families, and peers are influenced by the harmful effects of racism and social and
economic injustice. At the same time, communities, peers, and families have critically important roles in helping
individuals confront racism and deal with its effects on their health and reducing inequity more broadly. This
Core’s objectives are centered on how supports from communities, peers, and families impact and can best be
mobilized to promote substantive positive changes in the lives and health of those affected by diabetes.
The Core is an outgrowth of the Michigan-UNC Peer Support Core, funded through the Michigan Center for
Diabetes Translational Research, 2016-21. It continues the Peer Support Core’s emphasis on the variety of
peers and peer support approaches and the processes that undergird them, while expanding on these to
include families and communities. With its national focus, the Core will serve colleagues at the University of
Michigan, the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, and diabetes researchers across the US. This will
include individual consultation to researchers and on research projects, national outreach, and facilitation such
as through webinars and annual research workshops of a national Special Interest Group of researchers
interested in the contributions of and interactions among community, peer, and family supports for reducing
inequity in diabetes prevention and management."

10868701,"Children living in poor-urban neighborhoods bear a high burden of asthma morbidity, and there is strong
evidence that housing-related environmental exposures such as pest allergens are a major driver of this
excess asthma morbidity. Historic residential discrimination together with systemic disinvestment in
neighborhoods have contributed to poor neighborhood and housing conditions, which make successful
mitigation of housing-related exposures difficult, and in many cases, impossible. In contrast, housing mobility
programs, where families are supported in moving to less segregated communities, may address the root-
causes of the exposures that drive asthma disparities, while also serving as a tool by which we can parse the
role of various housing and neighborhood exposures and understand their long-term effects on asthma. In our
Mobility Asthma Project (MAP, R01 ES026170-05), children with asthma are followed before and after moving
from high-poverty segregated neighborhoods to low-poverty neighborhoods. We have found, so far, that with
moving, allergen levels and asthma outcomes are markedly reduced. This suggests that housing policy may be
a tool to reduce asthma disparities. However, while these initial findings strongly support the benefit of housing
mobility programs on short-term asthma outcomes, additional questions have emerged which can only be
answered by follow-up of this unique cohort. Our aims here are (1) To compare long-term (4-7 years) asthma
morbidity and home exposures between low-income, minority children with asthma who move to low-poverty
neighborhoods with similar children living in high-poverty neighborhoods, (2) To determine if moving from a
high- to a low-poverty neighborhood is associated with improved lung function growth among the original MAP
participants by repeatedly assessing lung function up to 4-7 years post-move and comparing their lung function
trajectories with a similar population from the URECA cohort and (3) To examine the role of stress, measured
by: a) exposure to neighborhood stressors, b) parental/caregiver stress, and c) child stress in the relationships
between indoor exposures, moving, and asthma morbidity and lung function. The proposed MAP Follow-Up
Study is poised to advance our understanding of the long-term effects of living in poor quality housing in high
poverty neighborhoods on asthma and lung function growth and directly inform the development of policy-
oriented interventions, such as expansion of housing mobility programs, which show great promise for
reducing the disproportionate burden of asthma among minority children with asthma."
10692777,"PROJECT SUMMARY .
Acute ischemic stroke is the leading cause of disability in the United States and the second-leading cause of
death worldwide. AIS that involves a major cervical or cerebral artery is termed a large vessel occlusion, and
recent landmark randomized studies found that endovascular thrombectomy is an effective treatment for
ischemic stroke caused by large vessel occlusion of the internal carotid, middle, or anterior cerebral arteries
(anterior circulation). However, up to 15% of large vessel occlusions occur in the vertebral or basilar arteries,
and these posterior circulation stroke patients were largely excluded from modern endovascular thrombectomy
trials. Clinical outcomes in patients with vertebral or basilar artery occlusions are often poor with severe
disability or death occurring in 30-54% and 36-86% of patients, respectively. There are no prospective or
randomized data designed to determine which imaging strategies should be used to guide thrombectomy
treatment decisions in this understudied population.
PRECISE (PeRfusion imaging to identify postErior CIrculation candidateS for thrombEctomy) is a prospective
cohort study of patients with acute ischemic stroke due to occlusion of the vertebral or basilar artery within 24-
hours of symptom onset. Patients will undergo CT or MRI cerebral perfusion imaging prior to endovascular
thrombectomy treatment. The results of this study will determine if cerebral perfusion imaging can identify a
subset of patients who are most likely to have a favorable outcome after thrombectomy treatment. PRECISE
has the potential to improve the imaging evaluation of patients with acute ischemic stroke of the posterior
circulation, to provide valuable prognostic information regarding thrombectomy efficacy in these patients, and
to define sub-groups of patients who might benefit from future neuroprotective strategies."
10913463,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Uveitis is an important cause of visual morbidity, responsible for an estimated 10% of blindness in the United
States with an annual associated cost of $242.6 million. Prior studies have sought to elucidate the incidence
and prevalence of uveitis; however, these studies have been limited in scope by age subset, localized
geography, referral practice setting, or specialized health systems environment. The primary objectives of this
K23 career development proposal are: 1) to demonstrate the benefit of using multiple databases to
characterize the epidemiology of uveitis across the U.S., elucidating disparities in risk factors for its
development, persistence, and progression; and 2) to provide an academic uveitis and vitreoretinal surgeon
with the training and mentored research experience necessary to conduct independent clinical research.
Achieving these objectives will provide critical skills and experiences necessary to establish an independent
research program focused on applying clinical informatics to improve the clinical care of patients with uveitis.
The proposed K23 application will provide additional training in four vital areas: 1) epidemiology and
mechanisms of chronic disease; 2) quantitative characterization of health economics and health disparities; 3)
biostatistical methods for health services research; 4) validation and analysis of very large clinical databases.
The proposed research will capitalize on the strengths of two unique databases containing large and diverse
cohorts of patients, including health claims-based data from the Optum Clinformatics Data Mart and electronic
medical record-derived data from the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services safety net healthcare
system, to generate exploratory knowledge on health disparities in the epidemiology and treatment of ocular
inflammatory diseases. After validating longitudinal samples of patients with uveitis, the prevalence of uveitis in
diverse populations will be estimated, documenting race-ethnic and other disparities. Risk factors for the
development of uveitis and its sequelae will be incorporated in developing and testing models to investigate to
what degree risk factors might affect health disparities. The interaction between race and smoking status will
be a particular factor of interest. Population-based treatment patterns and health care costs associated with
non-infectious uveitis will be characterized. Socioeconomic disparities in the utilization of steroid-sparing
immunomodulatory therapy will be explored. The results of the proposed research will provide the foundation
for a future longitudinal study examining the benefit of targeted interventions in patients at higher risk of
blindness from uveitis. The ultimate goal of my research is to develop risk-stratification and treatment protocols
that guide the standardized care of patients with uveitis and decrease the incidence of ocular inflammatory
disease and its associated ocular morbidity."

Biological Analysis Core. The cardiopulmonary system is a major inter-dependent organ system in the human
body, which has a major impact on overall life span and aging. Understanding the mechanisms that distinguish
beneficial from deleterious senescence and the heterogeneity underlying senescent cell states in this organ
system is critical. The overall aim of the Biological Analysis Core (BAC) is to generate a high-resolution map
of cellular senescence in lung and heart tissue across the lifespan, using state-of-the-art technologies, and
identify robust biomarkers of cellular senescence that will predict therapeutic responses to senolytics. We will
generate and refine endogenous signatures of cellular senescence at single cell resolution in healthy lung and
heart tissue employing comprehensive profiling of current markers of senescence using unbiased high-content
screening. We will apply a range of state-of-the-art, high-resolution, and high-throughput methods to calibrate,
validate, and produce precise mapping data of senescence. These will include multi-color flow cytometry, high
resolution imaging of cleared as well as native tissue, scRNASeq/snATAC/PIC-seq multi-omics, proteomics, and
spatial transcriptomics. We will interrogate 3D ex vivo human lung and heart tissue subjected to specific drivers
of senescence (e.g., DNA damage, telomere attrition) to define senescence heterogeneity and refine current
senescence signatures. Lung and heart PCTS will be subjected to defined senescence-inducing perturbations
to map the response of single cells in their natural 3D environment using omics analysis and 3D high-resolution
confocal time-lapse imaging for visualization, tracking, and tracing of senescence cells in their natural
environment ex vivo. Finally, we will define the senescence phenotype and function of primary senescent cells
sorted from human lung and heart tissue and will determine cell- and organ-specific responses to senolytics by
assessing their changes in senescence signatures and SASP biomarkers. These novel signatures and
biomarkers of senescence generated in the BAC will continuously feed into tissue mapping analysis and will
thereby refine the spatiotemporal mapping of cellular senescence by hierarchical clustering and deconvolution
using computational analysis and artificial intelligence approaches. This will allow us to map senescent cells at
unprecedent spatial resolution and 3D reconstruction across the lifespan and to generate a comprehensive and
in-depth Lung and Heart Senescence Map."
10910035,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Eukaryotic cells are defined by their organelles, membrane-enclosed compartments in which specific cellular
processes are carried out. The nucleus is the largest organelle, contains all genetic material, and enables
separation of gene transcription from protein translation. As the nuclear envelope (NE) serves as a tight barrier
enclosing the nucleus, the cell requires machinery to establish and control nucleo-cytoplasmic communication.
There are two principally different components to this machinery. On one hand, nuclear pore complexes
(NPCs) serve as the main conduit for molecular exchange across the NE. On the other hand, universally
conserved linker of nucleo- and cytoskeleton (LINC) complexes serve as physical tethers across the NE, which
are necessary for positioning the nucleus and for mechano-sensing in a diverse set of circumstances.
Dysfunction of the machinery is at the core of important human diseases, including skeletal and cardiac
myopathies, premature aging, and cancer. Our goal is to understand the structure of the protein complexes
involved in nucleo-cytoplasmic communication at high (atomic) resolution. Such information helps to identify
and separate the myriad functions this machinery carries out and that we are still only beginning to fully grasp.
High resolution information further provides the basis for structure-guided drug design to interfere with the
salient human diseases, such as Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy (EDMD) and Primary Dystonia, which
are still not cured. The structural characterization of the NPC and the LINC complex are challenging, because
of the size and complexity of these multi-MDa assemblies. Over the past 15 years, we have made significant
advances on both problems. For the NPC, we have chosen a highly productive bottom-up approach, in which
we characterized multi-subunit complexes predominantly by X-ray crystallography, the building blocks of the
massive, 40-100 MDa NPC. Those structures have now been used in combination with cryo-electron
tomographic (cryo-ET) maps of assembled NPCs to generate composite structures that attempt to position the
roughly 500 individual proteins within one NPC. For the LINC complex, we solved the universally conserved
core component and have started to untangle the diverse network of its components, the Sad1/UNC-84 (SUN)
and Klarsicht/ANC1/Syne-Homology (KASH) proteins. Going forward, the challenge is the structural
characterization of large and dynamic assemblies, which is true for both, the NPC and the LINC complex, for
the latter particularly when including the connection to the nucleo- and cytoskeletal components. The dramatic
advances in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) over the recent past make this technology particularly
important for our studies. We anticipate combining X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM for studying the most
relevant structures going forward. The success of this will depend upon innovative, tailored methods to
address the particular challenges that come with each project. We have repeatedly shown over the past
decade how to successfully approach such challenges and have devised methods to meet them."

Expanded Program Project Summary
 Public health surveillance is the ongoing systematic collection, analysis, interpretation and dissemination of
data regarding a health event for use in public health action to reduce morbidity and mortality and to improve
health. State-based occupational safety and health surveillance programs are in a unique position to utilize
state-specific data sources and identify emerging occupational health and safety issues.
 Washington’s research and surveillance actions are based on data, input from multiple advisory groups,
and opportunities to take advantage of emerging interest from the public, press, or others in occupational
safety and health. Data based prioritization of research is influenced by the magnitude, severity, and cost of
conditions proposed for surveillance, such as work-related musculoskeletal disorders and workplace traumatic
injury fatalities. Recognition that many work-related injuries and illnesses are underreported to data systems
factors into surveillance prioritization for occupational disease and occupational exposures (e.g. our proposals
for respiratory disease and for hazardous occupational exposures to lead). Moreover, the burden of
occupational exposures, injuries, and illnesses are not shared equally across the working population with racial
and ethnic minorities likely suffering higher occupational injury and illness rates due to occupational
segregation into higher risk occupations and industries. Finally, there are often data gaps, like identifying
occupational contributions to infectious diseases, which influence our prioritization of surveillance projects.
With these factors in mind, in this research proposal, we intend to do the following:
1. From stakeholder input identify and respond to emerging occupational safety and health issues with data.
2. Complete the CSTE occupational health indicators to describe occupational exposures, injuries, and
 illnesses in Washington.
3. Create an occupational amputations surveillance system. Following creation, use the system to evaluate
 our state OSHA actions to prevent such injuries and streamline a system of improved reporting of
 amputations to regulatory authorities.
4. Lead efforts to improve industry and occupation coding on notifiable infectious diseases and identify
 workplace infectious disease clusters.
5. Continue Washington’s ABLES program and evaluate changes to the workplace lead exposure policies.
6. Implement expanded program surveillance projects, addressing fatal occupational injuries, work-related
 musculoskeletal disorders, occupational respiratory disease, and identifying racial and ethnic disparities in
 occupational injury and illness rates.

The Illinois occupational surveillance program, now in its 11th year of funding, is seeking program renewal in
order to continue to pursue population and case based occupational surveillance activities with the goal of
proactively identify emerging hazards and promoting policies to protect workers. As the bona fide agent of the
Illinois Department of Public Health, our research team at the University of Illinois Chicago, School of Public
Health has taken on the role of building occupational health surveillance capacity in Illinois.
We are applying for an expanded program comprising of a fundamental program and three expanded
projects. We plan to continue to lead the effort in the state of Illinois to enhance occupational safety and
health surveillance with the following programs:
-Fundamental Illinois Occupational Surveillance Program: Conduct active surveillance of occupational
injuries and illnesses in the State of Illinois utilizing recognized and new data systems with a particular focus on
high risk industries, as well as underserved and precarious workers. We will expand health informatics
capacity, organize statewide communications, and continue to build partnerships with stakeholders.
- Expanded Project #1- Linking Occupational Surveillance Data, Work Practices and OSHA
Enforcement Activities in Illinois: We aim to develop a “system of systems” through coordination with OSHA
and other public health stakeholders in Illinois. The proposed program will (1) develop a real-time surveillance
program to inform OSHA’s unprogrammed inspections, (2) analyze occupational injury and illness data
captured in data systems not available to OSHA in order to identify high risk industries, employers with
recurring severe injuries, and characterize emerging hazards to inform OSHA’s programmed inspections, (3)
assess the reliability of employer reporting of severe injuries, and (4) strategically coordinate efforts between
OSHA and other stakeholders.
- Expanded Project #2 - Work-related Injuries in Chiropractors: Surveillance and Training: We will
conduct occupational surveillance of ergonomic hazards and musculoskeletal health risks among
chiropractors. We will also develop continuing education material, deploy a CE course through a partnership
with the national association, and survey chiropractors about workplace hazards, knowledge regarding injury
prevention and barriers to mitigating these ergonomic hazards.
-Expanded Project #3 - Pesticide Related Illness Surveillance Program: Develop occupational surveillance
system to monitor pesticide related illnesses and use these data to develop outreach and training among high
risk workers. We will build a collaborative network of stakeholders to assess and engage workers with the goal
of reducing pesticide related illnesses in Illinois."

Single cell sequencing technology enabled us to identify the aberrant molecular alterations in diseased cells
presenting altered signaling pathways and emergence of disease-associated cell populations, leading to multi-
scale cell architectures in disease tissue micro-environment. However, drawbacks such as low sequencing
depth per cell, expensive costs and loss of cross-cell signaling information have hindered its broader
applicability to large-scale cohorts. On the contrary, clinically well-defined, multi-modal and high-depth bulk-
based sequencing data are abundantly available in public domain, and can be utilized to assemble robust
molecular models of the genetic diseases, and infer cell population abundances in the samples. Especially,
network biology approaches have been effective for integrating large-scale and diverse biomedical datasets in complex
human diseases, and dissect the disease mechanisms and novel therapeutic strategies. Thus, a systems approach to
synergistically utilize these complementary aspects of bulk and single-cell sequencing data is urgently needed to
construct the robust molecular models of disease mechanisms while addressing the multi-scale nature of cell
architectures in diseased tissues. Firstly, we will systematically investigate multi-scale cell architectures by
developing a novel unsupervised cell clustering approach, single-cell recursive multi-scale clustering via local
embedding (scRECIEM). Within scRECIEM, a novel cell-cell network construction algorithm will be developed
by embedding each cell with its nearest neighboring cells on topological sphere, and yield computation
complexity that linearly scales with the number of cells when parallelized. This will be accompanied by a top-
down divisive clustering approach that adaptively utilizes informative features at each split, which is guided by
network compactness measure, υ(α). These will identify a hierarchy of cell clusters captured at different
resolutions. Secondly, we will develop integrative multi-scale network analysis (iMUSNET) framework to
construct data-driven and mechanistic network models of disease etiology by utilizing the context-matched bulk
samples. Within iMUSNET, the context-matched pairs of bulk and single-cell cohorts will be systematically
collected, and we will construct multi-scale gene interaction networks capturing diverse co-expressed modules
at different resolutions. These gene modules will be tested for enrichments with a compendium of clinico-
genomic gene signatures curated within the bulk cohort. Key driver analysis will systematically look for
potential up-stream regulators of the clinic-genomic signatures by leveraging the network model topology.
Further, we will infer abundances of the context-matched single-cell clusters with high accuracy by utilizing the
scRECITE-inferred cell phylogeny, and these will inform relevant disease associated cell populations in the
bulk cohort. Overall, iMUSNET will generate a number testable hypotheses as potential regulators and
subnetworks underlying the disease of interest."

Six million Americans suffer from atrial fibrillation (AF), a heart rhythm abnormality that is increasing in
prevalence and is also a major risk factor for stroke. AF accounts for 15% of ischemic strokes, resulting in
permanent disability in 60% of cases and death in up to 20%. Oral anticoagulation (AC) is effective for AF-
related stroke prevention and the vast majority of AF patients have a guideline-directed indication for oral AC.
Despite this, only half of eligible AF patients receive treatment. This is particularly true among non-white AF
patients, in whom AC use is lower and stroke rates are higher. The proposed project, SUPPORT-AF IV:
Supporting Use of AC through Provider Prompting about Oral Anticoagulation Therapy for AF, will examine the
impact of a novel AC clinical decision support tool within the electronic health record (EHR) on AC prescribing
behaviors among healthcare providers from two distinct health systems who receive it. We will also examine
clinician engagement through provider interviews and detailed study of behaviors using electronic health
record access logs. Finally, we will refine the alert, develop a comprehensive dissemination plan, and create
an implementation toolkit to widen the use of the alert at other learning health systems nationally. Specific
Aims include: Aim 1: (alert enhancement) Enhance alert which will fire when eligible patients (those with AF
and elevated stroke risk not on AC) visit cardiology providers and PCPs; enhancements include links to
educational material, peership resources, and communication tools to use with patients not on AC. Aim 2:
(adherence: AC initiation and persistence) Measure adherence including AC initiation and AC persistence
(staying on AC for one year) in eligible patients (n=2632) of providers randomized to receive vs. not receive
alert ; repeat measurements in the subset of minority patients (n= 402). Aim 3: (mechanism of effect)
Measure association of digital crumbs with AC initiation and persistence; crumbs include alert specific actions
(opening smart set and linking out to patient educational materials, peership resources, and communication
tools), alert specific orders, other orders, and review of access log actions (review of various items - specialist
notes, cardiac testing results, or medication list). Aim 4: (provider and patient satisfaction) Interview
intervention providers (n=20) about satisfaction with alert and AC management; interview patients (n=25)
satisfaction with AC management received from intervention providers. Aim 5: (dissemination and
implementation) Refine alert, develop a comprehensive dissemination plan, and create an implementation
toolkit that captures all lessons learned from measuring effectiveness, mechanism of effect, and provider and
patient satisfaction.
We are applying for the R01 (PA-18-722) - Improving Patient Adherence to Treatment and Prevention
Regimens. Our research team brings together extensive expertise in AC care, informatics, implementation
science and health disparities that will guide us in the execution of the proposed aims."
10918081,"Project Summary/Abstract
My career began with the identification of cell surface markers on invasive cells, and led to the discovery of
how integrins αvβ3 and αvβ5 on endothelial cells respond to cues within the tumor microenvironment to
promote angiogenesis. I later demonstrated that αV integrins on tumor cells use these same fundamental
pathways to achieve aggressive, invasive, and metastatic behavior. Now, my R35 proposal represents a
further evolution of these concepts to ask how tumor cells undergo reprogramming in response to cellular
stresses, including hypoxia, nutrient deprivation, or cancer therapy. We find that αvβ3 expression can be
induced by stress to reprogram tumor cells toward a stress-tolerant, drug-resistant, stem-like state that is
associated with tumor progression and metastasis for a wide range of cancers. Because individual tumors use
this integrin to overcome unique challenges, we will define how αvβ3 activates downstream effectors that vary
between tumor type, genetic profile, and microenvironment. The overall goal of my future research program is
to understand how such tumors use integrin αvβ3 to gain stress tolerance so that we can devise ways to attack
this process therapeutically. This proposed research will not only lead to a fundamental understanding of how
tumors adapt to therapy or microenvironmental stress, but it should identify new druggable targets to limit
cancer progression by preventing or overcoming tumor cell drug resistance and stress tolerance."

Although impressive progress has been made to reduce the burden of heart disease, the illness remains the
leading cause of death in the United States. Notably, many types of persistent heart injury can cause pathological
remodeling of the heart and progression to heart failure (HF). Our goal is to identify novel molecular pathways
responsible for such transition, since targeting them therapeutically presents an exciting opportunity to reverse
heart remodeling and improve survival. While transcriptional regulators of progression to HF have been studied
extensively, the importance of post-transcriptional regulation, such as chemical modification of messenger RNA,
has been overlooked. Recent studies recognized that methylation of mRNA in position N6 of adenosines (m6A)
was essential for the heart’s ability to adapt to stress, but the master regulator of this mechanism remains
unknown. This proposal is aimed to identify the undiscovered cardiac mediator of m6A-dependent mechanism
and elucidate how exactly m6A methylation acts to maintain homeostasis in the heart. After methylation, m6A-
modified mRNAs can be recognized by specific mRNA-binding proteins belonging to the YTH domain family
(YTHDF), of which YTHDF1 is a key member expressed in the heart. Our preliminary proteomics data from
mouse hearts show that YTHDF1 is the only member in its family to interact with the protein Hook homolog 3
(HOOK3), which binds motor proteins to activate cargo movement along the microtubules. Since
ribonucleoproteins can use microtubular routes to reach their sites of localized translation, our central hypothesis
is that YTHDF1 is critical for maintenance of cardiac homeostasis post-stress by modulating m6A-mRNA
translation through its interaction with HOOK3. To test this hypothesis, we have already generated a novel
conditional mouse model with cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of YTHDF1. In Aim 1, we will subject control and
cardiomyocyte-specific YTHDF1 knockout mice to a pressure-overload model of heart failure to define the
requirement of YTHDF1 for cardiac stress adaptation. In Aim 2, we will then perform ribosome profiling to
determine the global impact of YTHDF1 on mRNA translation and crosslinking immunoprecipitation assays to
identify its key mRNA targets in adult cardiomyocytes. Finally, in Aim 3 we will characterize YTHDF1 interaction
with HOOK3 and analyze its functional significance using a variety of exciting molecular biology techniques.
Overall, our approach is innovative because it aims to define the entirely novel function of YTHDF1 in the heart.
This proposal is also significant because it will fill knowledge gaps about the mechanism for YTHDF1-dependent
regulation of m6A-mRNA fate through our newly discovered HOOK3 interaction. The proposed study is also
significant because targeting direct effectors of mRNA processing such as YTHDF1 opens new avenues for
correcting pathological protein synthesis in the heart. Markedly, such knowledge can offer unique transcription-
independent targets for restoring healthy biology of cardiac muscle cells."
10891453,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Given that anorexia nervosa (AN) has the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric illness and current
treatments show limited efficacy, there is a crucial need to better understand the brain mechanisms driving the
pathophysiology of this disorder. This proposal combines an experimental medicine approach focused on
gastrointestinal (GI) interoception with computational modeling to probe neural circuits of interoception and
appetite-related gastric processing in AN. The goal is to identify perceptual and neural markers for AN at the
individual patient level and apply machine learning methods to test clinical outcomes prediction longitudinally.
Supported by our preliminary data, this proposal is based on the premise that the pathophysiology of AN
includes a computational dysfunction manifested by cognitive suppression of the expected precision of afferent
interoceptive signals associated with hunger, which reduces their motivational influence and facilitates
maladaptive and avoidant eating behaviors. We propose a case-control study with 65 AN and 65 healthy
comparisons who will undergo extensive baseline testing using a novel GI interoception probe during
measurement of symptoms, behavior, circuits, and physiology. Sensory stimulation will occur during the
premeal period, anchoring responses to an anticipatory context with high relevance to the disorder. These
individuals will be followed for 180 days to examine clinical outcomes. A computational approach will examine
the basic hypothesis that AN individuals have lower sensory precision for GI interoception and that the degree
of sensory imprecision is related to clinical characteristics. Moreover, we will examine the relationship of this
imprecision to circuit and physiological measures. We will then apply machine learning approaches to these
neurophysiological and perceptual measures to longitudinally test the prediction of clinical outcomes. Achieving
the aims of this project will provide unique insights into the pathophysiology of AN by arbitrating whether AN is
a consequence of “top-down” or “bottom-up” dysregulation in the nervous system, which could transform our
understanding of how intrinsic interoceptive disturbances lead to AN. Pragmatically, it will result in new
technologies for identifying interoceptive dysfunction at the individual level, allowing psychiatry to develop
diagnostic and predictive biomarkers of AN. Thus the neurocomputational assay of gastrointestinal
interoception in AN could be used to develop low-cost, scalable, and objective tools for identifying dysfunction
in individual patients, to facilitate neurobiologically-based definitions of recovery, and to predict the risk of
relapse following treatment. Finally, this proposal lays the groundwork for the future development of precision
psychiatric interventions such as perceptual retraining therapies to target (and recalibrate) abnormal brain-
body interactions."

Sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a leading cause of acute respiratory failure in
critical illness. Morbidity and mortality are high and there are no proven pharmacologic therapies other than
antimicrobials. Sepsis-associated ARDS is characterized by pathologic degradation of the pulmonary
endothelial glycocalyx—a glycosaminoglycan-enriched endovascular layer necessary for pulmonary vascular
homeostasis. There is a vital need to identify early triggers of endothelial glycocalyx degradation in sepsis,
both to enhance our understanding of pathophysiology, and critically, to identify new therapeutic targets for
prevention and early treatment of sepsis-induced ARDS. Our published and preliminary data suggest that (1)
cell-free hemoglobin (CFH) is released into the circulation in sepsis and contributes to oxidant-mediated organ
dysfunction and death; (2) CFH can directly injure the lung endothelial glycocalyx, causing degradation and
shedding; (3) haptoglobin, an endogenous scavenger for cell-free hemoglobin that limits its ability to cause
oxidative injury has a common genetic variant, HP-2, that increases the risk of ARDS in both humans and mice
with sepsis; and (4) patients and mice with sepsis and the HP-2 variant have increased degradation of the
endothelial glycocalyx and evidence of increased oxidative stress. The studies in this proposal will build on
these preliminary findings to characterize the mechanisms by which CFH-mediated endothelial glycocalyx
degradation is modified by the HP-2 genotype. Our primary goal is to translate these findings to new targeted
therapies that will be tested in our novel isolated human lung model as preparation for rapid translation to
targeted clinical trials in sepsis. In Aim 1, we will use state-of-the-art mass spectrometry analyses of circulating
glycosaminoglycan fragments to determine the extent and signature of endothelial glycocalyx shedding in
patients with the HP-2 variant, study the association with ARDS and determine downstream mechanisms of
endothelial injury. In Aim 2 we will use genetically manipulated mouse models to determine the contribution of
heparanase and oxidative injury to glycocalyx degradation in mice with the HP-2 genotype. In Aim 3, we will
test the therapeutic potential of targeting oxidant mediated injury in the HP-2 genotype to preserve the
endothelial glycocalyx in the isolated perfused human lung as a translational bridge to future patient studies.
The studies proposed in these aims have the potential for major and sustained scientific impact. Since HP-2 is
the most common allele of the HP gene and over 40% of people of European or African ancestry are
homozygous for this allele, targeting patients with the HP2 genotype with therapies to prevent endothelial
glycocalyx degradation is a new approach that could have a major impact on clinical outcomes."
10817219,"PROJECT SUMMARY: EQUITABLE IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE (EIS) CORE (E)
 Based on CHARM strategic growth, significant local and regional investigator need, the National Ending
the HIV Epidemic (EHE) Plan and National HIV/AIDS Strategy, and the importance of equitable implementation
science (EIS) in S. Florida, US South, and the US generally, we propose a new EIS Core in CHARM as part of
our transition from a Developmental to a Full Center. The US HIV epidemic is regionally concentrated in the
US South, with Miami-Dade County (MDC) a leading HIV epicenter and priority region of the EHE plan. Within
MDC, HIV disparities that reflect those across the US and in the South (e.g., race/ethnicity, sexual identity, and
urban vs. rural) are prominent. Given the regional and demographic HIV disparities, there is an urgent need for
equity-focused implementation practice, research, and expertise to end our local, high priority epidemic.
Numerous evidence-based interventions (EBIs) have demonstrated efficacy in addressing HIV disparities in
MDC and populations who experience health disparities in the US South, but lack of EBI adoption,
implementation, and sustainment in community and clinical settings impede EHE progress. Relatedly,
investigators and community collaborators require expertise in equitable implementation practice and research
to fuel implementation efforts. Without an explicit focus on equitably scaling up and disseminating EBIs,
disparities will worsen. As such, EIS is key to achieving the EHE goals in MDC, the US South, and the US. The
overarching goal of the newly proposed Equitable Implementation Science (EIS) Core is to equitably
implement and disseminate EBIs to reach communities who could benefit the most. More specifically, the
Specific Aims for the EIS Core are as follows: 1. To serve as a regional and national resource for early career
and established investigators new to EIS devoted to the study of HIV, mental health and community engaged
research; 2. To support HIV and mental health scientists in developing implementation science projects (e.g., K
or R-level NIH grants or a CHARM pilot application) via consultations; and 3. To create pathways to
stakeholder-engaged implementation research and practice. Accomplishing these Aims will involve key
activities including but not limited to an annual EIS symposium and boutique mentoring program, EIS
workshops and seminars, EIS consultation services from local and national experts, and partnering with the
Dev Core for Program Planning Micro-Grants to facilitate building trusted relationships between investigators
and stakeholders to support locally relevant EIS research. The EIS Director and Co-Directors have expertise
and NIH funding in EIS. Developing an infrastructure at the University of Miami to support EIS is critical to
achieving EHE goals and developing a cadre of EIS scientists who can support the development of future EIS
research at UM, in our region, and nationally. Adding the EIS Core to CHARM will contribute new key activities
that are synergistic with the other Cores. The EIS Core will provide consultations, training, and mentoring that
are key to EIS practice and research that can facilitate equitably Ending the HIV Epidemic in MDC and beyond."

This proposal describes the framework of an Avant-Garde DP1 award for Dr. Gaurav Gaiha M.D. D.Phil. Dr.
Gaiha is currently an Assistant Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts General
Hospital and the Ragon Institute of MGH, Harvard and MIT. Dr. Gaiha’s research is focused on leveraging an
innovative approach known as structure-based network analysis towards the development of a functional HIV
cure. This new methodology developed by Dr. Gaiha integrates network theory principles with protein structure
data to identify mutation-resistant cytotoxic T cell (CTL) epitopes within the HIV proteome. These ‘highly
networked’ epitopes were found to be preferentially targeted by individuals who naturally control HIV in the
absence of therapy, setting the stage for translation of these findings into an effective, CTL-based vaccine for
HIV. However, a major challenge to the development of a broad CTL-based vaccine is the highly polymorphic
nature of MHC-Ia alleles (HLA A/B/C allomorphs) within the population at-large. Thus, this proposal intends to
generate and test a vaccine candidate comprised of highly networked CTL epitopes restricted by the non-
classical MHC-Ib HLA-E molecule, which is highly conserved among humans with only two known alleles. Our
analyses of the HIV proteome have already identified five highly networked, HLA-E restricted HIV epitopes. To
evaluate whether these epitopes can be harnessed into a novel vaccine, this proposal first seeks to leverage a
novel mono-allelic HLA-E mouse developed using an innovative gene knock-in methodology. These animals will
then be injected with a diverse set of multi-epitope immunogens comprised of HLA-E-restricted highly networked
epitopes and assessed for the induction of de novo CTL responses in the presence and absence of drugs of
abuse. The development of such a vaccine would have a major impact on the HIV epidemic as it would be
broadly applicable to substance abusing populations who have reduced adherence and provide an economically
feasible approach to achieve a functional HIV cure. Demonstrating the immunogenicity of a multi-networked
HLA-E restricted epitope vaccine aims to overcome the obstacles associated with traditional approaches to
therapeutic HIV vaccination and is consistent with the mission of both NIDA and the broader mission of the NIH."

 The lentiviruses HIV-1 and HIV-2 cause acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in humans. The
conventional wisdom that HIV-2 is a more benign cousin to HIV-1 was recently challenged, however, in a large
study that found after 23 years of HIV-2 infection, cumulatively over 90% of participants had AIDS and 80% had
died. An effective, safe, and scalable cure for HIV should account for any unique features that may characterize
HIV-2 latency.
 During the course of its replication, HIV-2 integrates into human DNA and creates a reservoir that is a
barrier to virus eradication - as is the problem for HIV-1. How similar, or different, these HIV reservoirs may be
is unknown. The scientific premise of this proposal is that there are unrecognized unique features of HIV-2
biology that may impact virus eradication efforts, relative to HIV-1. As an example, the HIV-2 Vpx protein has
recently been shown to counteract the Human Silencing Hub (HUSH), a highly conserved gene silencing
complex known to repress HIV-1 proviruses, in ways that may impact virus latency and the reservoir landscape.
HIV-2 vpx reactivates latent provirus transcription in primary human CD4+ T cells through degradation of the
HUSH complex.
 To study HIV-2 latency, we have recruited participants with HIV-2 into our longitudinal HIV Eradication
and Latency (HEAL) cohort. Our HIV-2 proviral landscape preliminary data has identified differences between
the HIV-1 and HIV-2 proviral landscapes and we see phylogenetic evidence that suggests clonal expansion may
maintain the HIV-2 reservoir, findings we propose to explore further in this proposal. We hypothesize that HIV-2
latency reversal differs from HIV-1 reactivation, provide data to support this, and propose experiments to
investigate the mechanisms that may explain these observations.
 The goal of this proposal is to use HIV and host genomic information to define the landscape of HIV-2
integration and investigate the mechanisms that control HIV-2 latency and its reversal. Here we propose to
leverage cutting-edge techniques to address important knowledge gaps in our understanding of HIV-2 infection
biology. We hypothesize that HIV-2 differs from HIV-1 in integration landscape and reversal from latency and
that Vpx plays a key role in these differences. Specific Aims of this proposal are to define the HIV-2 integration
landscape in vivo, understand the role of HIV-2 vpx in virus latency, and investigate the transcriptional blocks to
HIV-2 latency reversal. Our approaches test hypotheses that are central to understand HIV-2 latency and its
reversal."

We propose M2Q2-HIV [mHealth Messaging to Motivate Quitline use and Quitting among Persons Living with
HIV (PLWH) in Vietnam (M2Q2-HIV)], an adaptation of our current computer-tailored smoking cessation
intervention in Vietnam. We seek to promote underused government resources for public health (quitline) and
nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) among PLWH in a sustainable manner. The intersection of smoking and
HIV/AIDS poses a serious public health threat in Vietnam. Vietnam is dealing with these two challenges with
parallel rather than integrated plans. Vietnam currently has 431 outpatient clinics for HIV testing, with 188 clinics
providing antiretroviral (ARV) treatment, covered by public insurance. Vietnam has setup telephone “quitline”
counseling with trained tobacco treatment specialists who also provide NRT. These clinical (HIV) and public
health resources (quitlines) are not connected, reducing both programs’ impact. To connect these resources, we
will adapt our current intervention for computer-tailored, text-based smoking cessation in Vietnam to be specific
to PLWH smoking behavior, for example, by addressing HIV stigma via developing motivational and tailored
messages written by PLWH smokers. To further increase message relevance for PLWH smokers, we will add a
computer-tailoring innovation: a machine-learning, collective intelligence system. Companies like Amazon use
collective intelligence systems to continuously learn and adapt to user feedback (e.g., pages liked, or products
purchased), thus, increasing message relevance. We developed the first collective intelligence system for
smokers. Our pilot data indicates that the ability to continuously learn may be even more beneficial for smokers
who are less ready to quit, such as like PLWH. We will test M2Q2-HIV by conducting a randomized control trial
with 600 PLWH smokers in two provinces in Northern Vietnam (26 clinics; 9,877 HIV patients). In Aim 1, we will
conduct formative work to prepare the M2Q2-HIV system for PLWH smokers. In Aim 2, we will randomize and
follow smokers for six months. Our effectiveness hypothesis will evaluate carbon monoxide (CO) verified, six-
month, seven-day point prevalence cessation. Process hypotheses will evaluate self-efficacy, quitline and NRT
use, and test our hypothesized model that specific measured processes will partially mediate observed
intervention effectiveness. Using qualitative interviews with key stakeholders and PLWH smokers, Aim 3 will
support nationwide M2Q2-HIV dissemination assessing acceptability and contextual factors guided by the
Practical, Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model (PRISM). This project builds upon a long-standing,
successful collaboration between institutions in Vietnam (Ministry of Health, Bach Mai Quitline, Institute of
Population Health and Development, Hanoi Medical University) and UMMS. Our team has expertise in smoking
cessation, HIV intervention including stigma related to concomitant substance use, and implementation of
complex interventions. The Vietnam Ministry of Health is committed to incorporating M2Q2-HIV as a permanent
part of the national infrastructure if proven effective."

Molecular imaging (MI) originated in the need to better understand the fundamental molecular pathways inside
organisms in a noninvasive manner. Over the past two decades, two factors have acted in concert to fuel the
ascent of molecular imaging in both the laboratory and the clinic: (1) an increased understanding of the
molecular mechanisms of disease and (2) the continued development of in vivo imaging technologies, ranging
from improved detectors to novel labeling methodologies. We have established a vibrant and state-of-the-art
laboratory-based translational research program. The Lewis lab portfolio is situated at the intersection of various
disciplines – radiochemistry, cancer biology, chemistry, pharmacology and engineering. Our program has
already demonstrated that our work is not just to generate an “image” but also to non-invasively and
quantitatively measure target biology within a cancer. Even with the extensive preclinical advances in cancer
imaging that we have accomplished and the unparalleled visualization of cancer biology we have achieved, our
ability to translate our findings cannot be understated. Our program has excelled in the clinical translation of new
imaging agents, providing new insights into cancer biology in humans. In the realms of this R35 we plan to focus
on three main areas of discovery: (1) Can our successful imaging agents be transformed into theranostic agents
with the ability to quantify the target through non-invasive imaging while providing concomitant lethality? (2) How
can our theranostic agents be optimally deployed to quantitatively and non-invasively interrogate and treat tumor
heterogeneity? (3) Following conventional and/or novel targeted therapies, can we image cancer-specific
pathways to provide immediate and real-time predictors of response? We will exploit recent findings and novel
methods to answer these questions, using an integrated set of imaging, chemical, genomic and cancer biology
approaches. As such, the questions posed above will be of more general relevance and will allow us to address
concepts related to the interactions between imaging, therapy, and response."

Our Interdisciplinary Predoctoral Neuroscience Training Program strives to provide individualized, high quality
training to predoctoral students interested in pursuing scientific careers in the biological and biomedical sciences.
This training grant will support 8 students in their first two years of graduate studies, before they start their
dissertation research. Graduate students in our program receive broad, multi-disciplinary training that spans
many levels of inquiry, from genes through cognition, and emphasizes concepts, methodologies, experimental
design, quantitative skills and program, and sophisticated analysis of the primary literature. Our core curriculum
consists of graduate only courses, seminars, and workshops that provide a strong scientific foundation in
neuroscience and develop skills that are essential for successful, independent research careers in neuroscience,
such as effective science writing and oral presentation, knowledge of scientific review processes, and training in
ethics. New initiatives include a revised advising system, more structured program evaluation, and greatly
expanded quantitative training. We foster an environment unconstrained by traditional discipline boundaries,
where graduate students are encouraged to work at the interfaces of these disciplines. The training program
includes 39 core participating faculty and ~60 predoctoral trainees. The faculty trainers are drawn from eight

10912744,"SUMMARY- CORE 1: EXPRESSION AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY (EMB) CORE
High quality protein samples are rate limiting for most structural and mechanistic investigations of DNA Repair
(DR) complexes and assemblies. Core 1, the Expression and Molecular Biology (EMB) Core, is designed to
lower these barriers for individual labs by providing access to centralized resources and expertise in advanced
recombinant protein technologies. We will implement modern DNA assembly technologies and incorporate
efficient protein production strategies to overcome these technical bottlenecks. The EMB Core will serve as a
research, production, and training resource for all four Projects. We will develop robust pipelines for (1)
engineering vectors to aid soluble expression and purification for three established expression systems –
bacteria, insect cells and human cells, and constructing single-gene and multi-gene expression vectors using
advanced DNA assembly techniques, such as BioBrick and Gibson assembly, (2) providing expression systems
that facilitate efficient purification of well-behaved, functional DR complexes, e.g. by incorporating cleavable GFP
tags to be employed with GFP-binder single-chain nanobody columns, (3) validating protein interactions and
partnerships in DR complexes and assemblies, and (4) using streamlined scaled-up expression platforms to
support large-scale cell production. We propose three Aims to empower SBDR-5.
Aim 1. Meet the molecular biological needs of SBDR. We will generate in-house modified vectors and create
expression constructs for expressing single DR proteins and multi-protein complexes for desired host systems.
Aim 2. Provide key protein production resources for SBDR. The available resources include large-scale insect
cell and bacteria production, selected human cell production for difficult-to-express DR targets, purification of
recombinant proteins when needed, and validation of interacting partners in protein complexes.
Aim 3. Establish and maintain a Repository/Distribution Center for SBDR. We have amassed a large collection
of key reagents and maintained a Repository/Distribution Center. A secure EMB website with a searchable
database will be created to streamline access to these resources and allow timely distribution of the requested
reagents to the SBDR labs.
All four Projects will rely on EMB Core services to support their molecular biological and protein needs. The EMB
Core has established close interactions with all Projects during the previous four funding cycles. Ready access
to EMB Core’s enabling expertise and resources will synergize all four Projects, avoid duplication of research
efforts, and promote active collaborations. The proposed EMB technologies and services will, in concert with the
SCB Core, accelerate SBDR-5 research and empower SBDR Projects by facilitating quantitative, high-resolution
structural insights for DNA repair machinery functions."
10912746,"SUMMARY - CORE 2: STRUCTURAL CELL BIOLOGY (SCB)
A major challenge for cancer structural biology in SBDR4 is to structurally define the DNA repair (DR) proteins
and assemblies that maintain genomic integrity. However. DR proteins and complexes have encoded flexibility
and function in spatially and temporally coordinated complexes that make their structural characterizations so
challenging. With SBDR investigators, Core 2, the Structural Cell Biology (SCB) Core overcomes these
extreme challenges by providing access to and expertise on cutting-edge structural biology technologies
needed to probe DR proteins and complexes and not available in individual research institutions.
Aim 1. Determine structures, conformations and assembly states. The SCB Core, centered at a national
synchrotron facility, will provide macromolecular crystallography (MX) and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS)
data collection and beamline scientist-level expertise for SBDR members. MX provides high resolution atomic
structures, while SAXS can rapidly assess flexibility, solution conformation(s), and assemblies. SCB SAXS
includes ligand or buffer screening and assessing DNA bending, via GOLD-SAXS.
Aim 2. Detect folds and conformations for integrative structural biology. Analysis of large complexes in the
Projects, by megadalton structural mass spectrometry (MS) and with SAXS-validated structure predictions, will
provide testable hypotheses on their own, or will accelerate CryoEM studies at individual institutes.
Aim 3. Define molecular architectures in reconstituted systems and in the cell through synchrotron soft X-ray
tomography (SXT) of reconstituted phase transitions and cells and super-resolution fluorescence
measurements for quantitative measurements of DR assemblies, that would otherwise be problematic for
traditional structural methods.
The SCB Core is centered at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) synchrotron, where three beamlines (12.3.1,
8.3.1, and National Center for X-ray Tomography/NCXT) will provide SAXS, MX, and SXT data collection to
SBDR members. For enabling access to additional structural technologies and capabilities, SCB has branches
at Calgary (MS), New York (super-resolution microscopy), Oxford (MX), and Scripps (MX).
All four Projects will use the SCB Core, regardless of structural expertise in member laboratories, to optimally
and efficiently address Project structural and mechanistic Aims in ways that typical laboratories and beamline
visits cannot or do not do. Together, these SCB modalities allow SBDR-5 interrogation of dynamic DR
machines from atomic to cellular scales. The broad, long range objective of the SCB Core is to support SBDR
Projects to determine the impact of sequence variations, the means to dissect multiple functions, and the
mechanisms whereby flexible and dynamic DR machinery functions."

The overarching goals of the Faculty Development Core (FDC) are to develop and implement best practices at
the department, college and university for mentoring and supporting diverse early-stage faculty dedicated to
health disparities research and to enhance research development and investigator capacity to conduct health
disparities research and submit competitive NIH R01 grant applications. Early career faculty will represent
diverse races and ethnicities, be committed to and engaged in the spectrum of health disparities research
(detecting, understanding, reducing) and focus in one of our cluster areas (aging, chronic disease and
environmental determinants). The specific aims of core are (1) To provide professional development and
implement best practices for mentoring and sponsorship to support the career development of the FIRST
faculty cohort and prepare them for successful promotion and tenure; (2) To support the research development
of the FIRST cohort to maximize the ability of the cohort to obtain R01-type research funding by their third year
on faculty; and (3) To build a community of Assistant Professors with a special focus on health disparities (from
population health to intervention) to increase high impact interdisciplinary research on health disparities
research at Drexel University. We will accomplish these aims through a set of evidence-based structured and
unstructured activities including: (1) one-on-one mentoring sensitive to intersectionality; (2) peer and near-peer
mentoring (3) use of the consultancy model, (4) writing accountability groups, (5) professional development
workshops (5) support for teaching and (6) research development activities including a grant writing bootcamp
and grant review activities. In addition, we will implement networking and scientific exchange events to
promote a culture of inclusion, reduce isolation and promote interdisciplinary and collaborative health
disparities research across the University generally. Our scientific premise is that successful implementation of
these aims will enable FIRST faculty to advance their scholarship and result in the submission of competitive
NIH R01s which have potential to advance health disparities research and impact individual and population
health outcomes. We will leverage programs and policies already in place as well as a rich health disparities
research environment at Drexel University to develop an innovative comprehensive faculty development plan
that supports the members of the FIRST Cohort and provides a pathway to success that will not only benefit
the FIRST cohort but can be scaled up to benefit Drexel University as a whole. Innovative aspects of our
approach include the strong focus on interdisciplinary approaches to health disparities research from etiology
to intervention, the bridging of public health and nursing and health professions (with connections to other
areas such as arts and sciences and medicine), the grounding in an urban university strongly committed to
civic engagement, and the leveraging of strength as a center of excellence in health disparities research and a
University context committed to diversity and inclusion reflected in recent growth and investments."
10848245,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder with no definitive treatment that reverses
the course of the disease, and we still lack a firm grasp on how older people develop AD. Bridging Integrator 1
(BIN1) is the second-largest genetic risk factor for late-onset AD. At least 12 different alternatively spliced BIN1
isoforms are expressed in the brain, including the neuron-specific BIN1 isoform 1 (BIN1iso1) and the ubiquitously
expressed BIN1 isoform 9 (BIN1iso9). In the brain gray matter of patients with AD, there is a decrease in neuronal
BIN1iso1 and an increase in BIN1iso9 compared to healthy controls. Thus far, evidence has shown that neuronal
BIN1 isoforms participate in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, endocytic recycling, and synaptic vesicle release and
retrieval. However, the mechanisms by which BIN1 contributes to these functions and the neighborhood of
proteins that BIN1 interacts with to accomplish these cellular tasks remain largely undefined. Therefore, a
fundamental gap in the field is an unbiased characterization of BIN1iso1 interacting proteins and
proximal neighbors. Closing this gap will help define BIN1’s biological functions in healthy and diseased brain
neurons. Utilizing the highly innovative proximity biotin ligase, TurboID, fused to BIN1iso1, will allow the
identification of all proteins within a 10-nm radius. TurboID-based proximity labeling coupled with the most recent
advanced quantitative mass spectrometry and data analysis methods represents a powerful strategy for
discovery research. My preliminary in vitro studies using this approach in mouse N2a neuroblastoma cells
resulted in the discovery of 234 proteins as BIN1-associated (proximal) or interacting proteins. These
results identified several known BIN1 interactors such as tau, dynamin, synaptojanin, and many previously
unknown proximal proteins. The following Specific Aims will translate these findings in vivo and dramatically
advance the field. Aim 1. Identify neuronal BIN1iso1 interacting proteins in vivo using wild-type mice under
homeostatic conditions. Aim 2. Establish neuronal BIN1iso interactome in mouse models of AD (5XFAD and
PS19) before and after the onset of pathology. This project will not only advance the field by providing those
studying AD and BIN1 with a list of BIN1iso1 proximal proteins to generate novel hypotheses but will also support
the applicant’s pre-doctoral research training in AD pathophysiology, advanced methods such as in vivo AAV
transduction, proximity-based labeling in the context of AD pathology, large-scale proteomics data analysis, and
bioinformatics analysis of BIN1 functional pathways. The dynamic and highly collaborative research environment
at the USF Health Byrd Alzheimer’s Institute will enhance the learning opportunities in cell biology and molecular
pathology within an established AD laboratory led by a committed mentor. Furthermore, research training in
proteomics approaches offered by the collaborator’s lab and the Proteomics Core facilities will complement the
applicant’s interdisciplinary research training in age-related neurodegenerative disease."
10996077,"Abstract
Platelet parent cells are megakaryocytes (Mks). Studies have historically focused on Mk derived platelet
production in the bone marrow (BM) (1). More recently, platelet-producing Mks have been shown to be present
in the lung, and our lab and others have described an immune modulatory phenotype of lung Mks (2-4). The
recent identification of a low ploidy, immune differentiated BM Mk sub-population (5) highlights the relationship
that lower Mk ploidy may correlate with a more immune differentiated Mk. We refer to the development of a Mk
immune modulatory sub-population as Mk immune differentiation. The origin of lung Mks and mechanisms of
their immune differentiation remain unknown.
It is assumed, without experimental evidence, that lung Mks are ‘seeded’ from immature circulating BM
Mks. Lefrancais et al. showed the presence of GFP+ Mks in the lung vasculature when a mTmG lung was
transplanted to a PF4-Cre-mTmG recipient. The authors argued that the presence of GFP+ intravascular lung
Mks demonstrated an extra-pulmonary source. However, intravascular and extravascular lung Mks have
morphological and perhaps functional differences, and extravascular lung Mks make up about 70% of all lung
Mks. Thus, the majority of circulating Mks would have to leave the blood and tissue migrate to become lung
resident. Without direct evidence for this trafficking, the definitive origin of extravascular lung Mks remains
unknown, but may have a major impact on their immune differentiation. I hypothesize that extravascular lung
Mks derive from a local hematopoietic progenitor pool independent of BM megakaryopoiesis. I will test this
hypothesis by using complementary methods, including irradiation and transfer experiments, lineage tracing,
and in vitro colony forming unit assays.
The impact of Mk immune differentiation on the platelet pool is still not clear. Lung Mks make platelets, although
the relative proportion of lung derived platelets remains controversial (4, 6). Emerging evidence from studies of
platelet heterogeneity are beginning to suggest that platelet subsets may have functional significance. I
hypothesize that lung resident Mks contribute to an immune-differentiated platelet sub-population. To test this
hypothesis, I will use a novel strategy to identify lung derived platelets using oropharyngeal CFSE administration
in physiologic and thrombocytopenic conditions such as PF4-Cre-iDTR mice and nonlethal murine malaria.
Results from my proposed studies will contribute to an improved understanding of immune differentiated
megakaryopoiesis, and its role in coordinated immune responses and platelet immune phenotypes, with direct
applications to many vascular inflammatory diseases."
10817695,"Accurate assessment of children’s (5-12yrs) free-living physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE) is critical to
understanding the complex and interdependent relationship between children’s PAEE and health outcomes. The
combination of movement (e.g., steps, counts, raw signal) and heart rate data provides reasonably accurate
estimates of children’s PAEE during lab conditions. However, the combination of movement and heart rate
(MOVE+HR) may be inadequate for predicting children’s free-living PAEE. Studies in adults demonstrate
including the type of activity (e.g., the participant is walking, running, cycling, etc.) improves estimates of free-
living PAEE, relative to using movement or MOVE+HR. Yet, this evidence is based on studies conducted in
adults. No studies of children have investigated the impact of adding activity type to PAEE prediction equations
that use MOVE+HR. Existing consumer wearables (e.g., Fitbit, Garmin) are promising for the assessment of
children’s free-living PAEE. These devices incorporate built-in pattern-recognition features that automatically
detect activity type, and these metrics are provided in a user-friendly format for the end-user; however, no known
studies have evaluated the ability of consumer wearables to autodetect activities in children. Consumer
wearables also use photoplethysmography to capture HR and accelerometry to capture movement. Their unique
ability to capture activity type, HR, and movement metrics could significantly improve estimates of free-living
PAEE in children. Aim 1 will evaluate the impact of including activity type, captured via direct observation, to
regression equations that use movement and HR data from consumer wearables (i.e., Garmin Vivoactive 4S
and Fitbit Sense). Aim 2 will evaluate the ability of consumer wearables (i.e., Garmin Vivoactive 4S and Fitbit
Sense) to automatically detect activities (i.e., walking, running, biking). To accomplish these aims, this study will
capitalize on the validation design (i.e., semi-structured physical activity protocol and data
management/extraction procedures) and draw on data collected from 120 children (5-12yrs) from an existing
R01 project. This project will use analytical techniques, including cross-sectional time series (CSTS), multivariate
adaptive regression spline (MARS), machine learning, and equivalence testing to address the following aims.
The project’s long-term goal is to advance the assessment of children’s PAEE in epidemiologic- and intervention-
based studies for children, which is critical to understanding the complex relationship between children’s PAEE
and health outcomes. Through the execution of this project, the following will be gained: an in-depth knowledge
of the literature related to assessment of PAEE in children, expertise designing and implementing validation
studies assessing PAEE in children, hands-on training using gold standard measures to assess children’s PAEE
and activity type, proficiency performing advanced analytical techniques, and scientific communication and
grantsmanship skills, including peer-reviewed publication, scientific presentation, mentored manuscript review,
and a drafted post-doctoral grant application."
10842247,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
In the United States, approximately 1 in 44 children are diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Many
children with ASD experience a reduced quality of life due to adverse health outcomes across the life course.
Early diagnosis and intervention services are critical for improving long-term outcomes for individuals with ASD.
However, because of historical practices of racial segregation and discrimination in the US, access to an early
diagnosis and intervention services are not equitable. Identifying and diagnosing children with ASD facilitates
access to appropriate services, but racial and ethnic disparities in healthcare services cause many Non-Hispanic
Black and Hispanic children with ASD symptomology to be undiagnosed and under-treated in the healthcare
system and under-represented in research studies generated from those clinical databases. Even though these
racial and ethnic disparities in ASD diagnosis are well documented, many epidemiologic studies use billing code
algorithms and healthcare databases to examine etiologic questions about ASD, often without necessary
consideration of potential structural biases. Thus, this proposed dissertation research will explore the impact of
information and selection bias on ASD research, with an application to the association between epidural
analgesia use and ASD. The dissertation research will address the following specific aims: (1) Assess the validity
(i.e., sensitivity, predictive values) of an ASD diagnosis documented in the medical record compared to a
diagnosis derived from gold standard clinical assessments (stratified by child's race and ethnicity); (2) Use
internal validation data to conduct a bias analysis to examine the impact of outcome misclassification on the
association between epidural use during childbirth and ASD; and (3) Conduct Monte Carlo simulations to assess
the impact of selection bias on the association between epidural use during childbirth and ASD. Data from the
Study to Explore Early Development (SEED), a large US multi-site case control study, will be used to conduct
the proposed research. During the grant period, the fellowship applicant will achieve the following goals: (1) gain
more in-depth experience in scientific writing and results dissemination activities; (2) obtain in-depth training in
responsible conduct of research; (3) develop analytical skills in methods for quantitative bias analysis and
simulation studies; (4) enhance professional and personal development; and (5) develop a strong understanding
of child development and the etiology of Autism Spectrum Disorders. These goals would allow the applicant to
establish a solid foundation in the etiology of ASD, health inequities, and quantitative bias analysis approaches
through additional coursework, seminars, guided readings, and consultation with the mentorship team.
Furthermore, they will give the applicant the skillset needed to achieve their goal of becoming a tenure-track
professor focused on bridging the gap between epidemiologic research and public health practice to improve
maternal and child health outcomes among racial and ethnic minorities."
10886509,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a deadly malignancy characterized by poor response to all existing
therapies. Although immunotherapy has shown great promise against multiple deadly cancers, single-agent
checkpoint immunotherapy has been largely ineffective in PDAC. This lack of response is in part attributed to its
extensive inflammatory, desmoplastic stromal reaction and hypoxic microenvironment. Although tumor hypoxia
induces adaptive changes in both cancer cells and the surrounding stroma, most studies on the role of hypoxia
in tumorigenesis have focused on cancer cell-intrinsic properties. The impact of hypoxia on stromal cells
themselves and their interactions with cancer cells has remained largely unknown. The major cell populations
found within the PDAC stroma—macrophages and fibroblasts—are known to be large producers of
immunosuppressive factors, some of which can negatively affect cytotoxic CD8+ T cell activity in tumors. CD8+
T cells play an essential role in the anti-tumor response and the efficacy of immunnotherapies relies on the
amount of CD8+ T cell infiltration within the tumor bed. Based on our preliminary observation that macrophages
and inflammatory fibroblasts are enriched in hypoxic tumor regions while T cells are excluded from hypoxic areas
in PDAC, I hypothesize that hypoxia suppresses infiltration and activation of CD8+ T cells by modulating their
interactions with macrophages and fibroblasts. In Specific Aim 1, I will determine whether macrophages are
critical for hypoxia-mediated CD8+ T cell exclusion and suppression by treating CD8+ T cells with conditioned
media derived from macrophage cultures under hypoxia and depleting macrophages in syngeneic orthotopic
PDAC tumors. In Specific Aim 2, I will determine how fibroblasts regulate CD8+ T cell recruitment and function
in hypoxic tumor regions by blocking a factor secreted from fibroblasts in syngeneic orthotopic PDAC tumors,
injecting a hypoxia probe into mice, and assessing CD8+ T cell infiltration and activation in hypoxic and normoxic
tumor regions. The results of my studies will further the field’s understanding of how hypoxia drives an
immunosuppressive microenvironment via the crosstalk between CD8+ T cells, macrophages, and fibroblasts,
and thus aid in the development of effective immunotherapeutic strategies."
10983731,"Project Summary
 Dry eye disease (DED) is an ocular condition affecting about 6.8% of people in the United States, 87% of
which have evaporative dry eye disease (EDED). In EDED, abnormalities in the tear film lipids cause tear film
instability and increased evaporation. These abnormalities are typically caused by obstruction of the meibomian
gland orifices or senescence of the acinar cells of the meibomian gland. Despite the high number of patients
with EDED, current therapeutics only provide brief, palliative relief. To design therapeutics specifically for EDED,
a better understanding of how the tear film is stabilized is required.
 To study tear film stability, the tear film of rabbits, a species with a naturally hyper-stable tear film, was
compared to humans which identified four nonpolar lipids in rabbit tears that are absent from human tears. One
nonpolar lipid (rNPL593) was formulated into a topical therapeutic and used as a treatment in rabbits with induced
DED, which increased tear film stability and decreased damage to the cornea compared to untreated rabbits.
 To explore how rNPL593 increased tear film stability, we developed a novel in vitro experimental platform,
which includes synthetic lipids that mimic the tear film lipid layer and the interactions of that layer with the
environment and the rest of the tear film. With this model, we observed the spontaneous separation of the
nonpolar lipids of the tear film. This spontaneous separation shares many characteristics with an intracellular
phenomenon called liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). This finding conflicts with the current view of the tear
film nonpolar lipid organization which consists of a lamellar arrangement of nonpolar lipids with weak, transient
interactions. Instead, we propose that the different nonpolar species are mixed by blinking and that LLPS occurs
during the interblink interval. This spontaneous separation destabilizes the tear film eventually leading to its
breakup. Additionally, we propose that the alterations in the tear film lipids seen in patients with EDED promotes
LLPS, causing their clinical signs. Exciting preliminary data suggests that the addition of rNPL593 to the in vitro
model decreases the self-aggregation and phase separation of the nonpolar lipids. In this proposal, we will utilize
fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and modulation of the ratios of the nonpolar lipids to further
characterize the LLPS phenomenon and the addition of rNPL593 to further interrogate the effect of rNPL593.
 To determine the clinical efficacy of rNPL593, we will utilize a mouse model of EDED. These mice are
deficient in acyl-CoA:wax alcohol acyltransferase 2 (Awat2), which causes alterations in meibomian gland
secretions, decreased tear stability and secondary corneal damage, similar to moderate to severe EDED.
Preliminary data suggests that Awat2 KO mice treated daily with rNPL593 ameliorated ocular surface disease
and meibomian gland obstruction. This project aims to investigate how rNPL593 effects meibomian gland
function in Awat2 knockout animals using transillumination meibography, transcriptomics and spatial lipidomics,
laying the ground work for future clinical applications for patients with EDED."
10926853,"In African American (AA) men prostate cancer is characterized by higher aggressiveness, more extensive
metastases, early onset, and increased mortality rates compared to those in Caucasian men. We propose to
evaluate role of PDEF (Prostate Derived Ets Factor) and TWIST-1 in PCa health disparity. The studies
proposed in this application are driven by our novel observations that there is graded decrease in PDEF levels
in prostate cancer cells with increasing aggressive phenotype and in prostate cancer tissue sections of
patients. We also observed in multiple clinical data sets that PDEF mRNA expression is decreased in high
Gleason grade PCa and in tumor metastasis. Moreover we observed a reciprocal relationship between PDEF
and Twist-1 expression in PCa tissues and that PDEF and Twist-1 expression could predict PCa patient
survival. In preliminary studies we observed that PDEF expression is decreased in prostate cancer cells from
AA men and in cells with aggressive phenotype, and experimental modulation of PDEF expression modulates
cell migration and clonogenic activity in part by promoting luminal differentiation. These exciting preliminary
data form the basis of our proposed hypothesis: First, that, “ In African American Men PDEF could serve as a
functional marker for distinguishing aggressive prostate cancer from an indolent disease.” Second that “PDEF
functions as a metastasis suppressor in prostate cancer in part by modulating expression of Twist-1”, and third
that “Loss of PDEF can help us stratify PCa patients that might respond to DNA methyl transferase inhibitors”.
We propose three aims to test these hypothesis. AIM 1: To establish differences in expression levels of PDEF
between grade-matched Prostate Cancer specimens from African American and Caucasian men and correlate
these with patient outcomes; AIM 2: To determine the role of PDEF in PCa metastasis and racial disparity
using in vivo model systems, and ; *AIM 3: To evaluate if prostate cancers with PDEF loss respond more
favorably to combination of ADT (Enzalutamide) and DNA methyl-transferase inhibitors (azacytidine and
decitabine) as compared to ATD alone. The proposed studies are innovative as these will enhance
understanding of role of PDEF in suppressing prostate cancer metastasis and help us evaluate usefulness of
PDEF/Twist-1 in early detection of patients that may harbor aggressive prostate cancer with enhanced
metastatic potential. The impact of our study will be on the development of a new method to distinguish
aggressive and metastatic phenotype of prostate cancer from an indolent disease, which will particularly
benefit AA men, and reduce ethnic disparity in in prostate cancer treatment outcomes."
10913508,"Although significant progress has been made in understanding the genetic origins of
neurodevelopmental disorders, it remains unclear what specific molecular steps are disrupted and in which
specific neurons types they are dysfunctional or inoperable. One potential reason for this lack of understanding
is that neurons, originally classified according the type of transmitter produced, are now well known to possess
substantial molecular, cellular, and functional heterogeneity. It seems plausible that neurodevelopmental
disorders may arise not only from developmentally altered identities of an entire population of one particular
neuron type but also from altered development of one of its specific molecular or functional subtype(s). There
has been a decades-long intense interest in the regulatory mechanisms controlling 5-HT neurons as 5-HT has
wide-ranging modulatory effects on central neural circuitry and dysfunction of the serotonergic system has
been implicated in several neuropsychiatric diseases including depression, stress-related anxiety disorders,
autism, intellectual disability, OCD, and schizophrenia. 5-HT neurons possess tremendous molecular,
morphological, and electrophysiological heterogeneity. However, developmental trajectories of 5-HT neuron
subtypes are currently unknown as are the regulatory mechanisms that govern their development. The
objective of the proposed research is to use single cell RNA-seq and single cell ATAC-seq to comprehensively
define the spatiotemporal developmental trajectories of 5-HT neuron subtype transcriptomes and chromatin
accessibility. We will combine recent advances in single-cell genomics methods together with our well-
established serotonergic transgenic tools, our extensive experience in flow sorting mouse 5-HT neurons, and
our bioinformatics expertise to investigate the development of single-cell 5-HT neuron transcriptomes and
chromatin accessibility throughout fetal to early postnatal maturation. We will also investigate at the single cell
level, the hypothesis that the two disease-associated terminal selectors in 5-HT neurons, Pet1 and Lmx1b,
function to determine postmitotic 5-HT neuron subtypes through differential regulation of subtype-specific gene
expression, subtype-specific chromatin accessibility and control of downstream subtype-specific transcription
factor codes. Pet1 is of special interest as homozygous knockout mutations in FEV, the human ortholog of
Pet1, were recently reported in two brothers with Intellectual Disability and Autism Spectrum Disorder. In Aim
1, we will define the developmental trajectories of 5-HT neuron subtypes. In Aim 2, we will investigate the
control of 5-HT neuron subtype transcriptomes by Pet1 and Lmx1b. In Aim 3, we will determine the chromatin
mechanisms involved in the generation of 5-HT neuron subtypes. The completion of our proposed aims will
lead to a greater understanding of the subtype-specific gene regulatory networks that generate 5-HT neuron
subtypes, which may help illuminate specific neurogenetic pathways that are disrupted in neurodevelopmental
disorders such as ASD/ID."
10914856,"Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC), the most lethal form of breast cancer, is a health disparity. IBC
has a greater incidence and younger presentation in African Ancestry women (AA) compared with white women
(W). IBC is also particularly aggressive in AA, who exhibit substantially shorter median survival compared to W,
irrespective of molecular subtype. The underlying causes of this disparity in clinical outcome, much of which
remains after controlling for medical coverage and treatment access, are poorly understood, severely limiting
potential strategies to close this gap. Our proposed work addresses the critical, unanswered questions - What
tumor biological mechanisms drive the more aggressive IBC biology in AA) and how can these mechanisms be
modulated therapeutically? Our epidemiological studies identify that modifiable risk factors like reproductive
factors (early age at first pregnancy, multiparity, and lack of breastfeeding) and high body mass index (BMI), are
associated with poor therapeutic outcomes and survival among AA-IBC compared to W-IBC. These stressors
have the potential to cause persistent inflammation in the mammary gland. A basic survival mechanism that is
intrinsic in both normal and cancer cells is the ability to constantly respond and adapt to stress stimuli (like
mutations, life-stressors, environmental changes, therapy) referred to as adaptive stress response (ASR).
Linking these observations, is our identification of ASR gene sets in IBC cells exposed to stress stimuli that show
race-specific differences in expression. These datasets lead to our overarching hypotheses that 1. a
heightened adaptive stress response consisting of NFκB activation, suppression of programmed cell death, and
pro-tumorigenic macrophages promotes outgrowth of invasive, metastatic and treatment resistant tumor cells in
AA-IBC; 2. pharmacologic inhibition of the ASR pathway in conjunction with macrophage inhibition will suppress
IBC growth and dissemination. To test this hypothesis, we propose Aims to (1) investigate whether AA- and W-
derived normal breast epithelial cells and IBC cell lines promote monocyte differentiation using a panel of
immortalized cell lines from core breast biopsies of AA and W healthy women and IBC cells in co-culture assays
with monocytes and how ASR pro-survival markers correlate with stromal patterns of stem cells and
macrophages in patient tissues by gene expression and immunohistochemistry analysis; (2) implant AA- and W-

Background: The metastasis of cancerous cells to distant and vital organs is responsible for in excess of 90%
of cancer mortalities. Given this extraordinarily high mortality rate, there is a significant need for the development
of novel therapeutic approaches that either eliminate metastatic cancer cells or eradicate incipient cancer cells
prior to metastatic dissemination. An important barrier to tumor progression and metastasis is anoikis, a caspase-
dependent cell death program induced by loss of integrin-mediated attachment to extracellular matrix (ECM).
However, it has become clear that ECM-detachment can induce anoikis-independent mechanisms that can
compromise cell viability. More specifically, we have discovered that detachment of non-cancerous epithelial
cells from ECM triggers a significant elevation in the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which compromises
cell survival in an anoikis-independent fashion. The understanding of the cellular changes that contribute to the
elevation of ROS during ECM-detachment remains rudimentary and the strategies utilized by cancer cells to
combat ROS during ECM-detachment are insufficiently explored. Therefore, these points represent significant
knowledge gaps that this grant proposal aims to address. Discernment of mechanistic information regarding
the links between ECM-detachment, ROS, and cell survival could provide targets for the design of the therapeutic
approaches aimed at specifically eliminating ECM-detached cancer cells; an outcome that may have significant
impact for patients with metastatic disease.
Objective/hypothesis: In aggregate, our preliminary studies have unveiled a novel cell death mechanism (with
a tumor suppressive function) that compromises the viability of ECM-detached cells: the induction of mitophagy
as consequence of RIPK1 signaling. As such, these data have motivated our central hypothesis that RIPK1-
mediated mitophagy during ECM-detachment functions as a barrier to breast cancer progression.
Specific Aim I: To elucidate the molecular mechanism by which ECM-detachment promotes RIPK1-dependent
mitophagy and initiates cell death.
Specific Aim II: To assess the capacity of RIPK1-mediated mitophagy to antagonize tumor formation in vivo
and to evaluate antioxidant inhibition as a novel strategy to limit tumorigenesis in cancers that are deficient in
RIPK1-mediated mitophagy
Anticipated Outcomes: Following the completion of these studies, we will have accumulated significant
mechanistic knowledge regarding the relationship between ECM-detachment, RIPK1 mitophagy, and cell death.
Thus, the completion of these studies will unveil fundamental biological insights regarding cancer cell
survival during ECM-detachment that may ultimately lead to the development of therapeutic approaches
to limit the dissemination of breast cancer cells."

Adverse events (AE) during care transitions range from 19-28% and may lead to readmissions, representing
an ongoing threat to patient safety. Early identification and escalation of patient-reported symptoms to inpatient
and ambulatory clinicians is critical, especially for patients with multiple chronic conditions (MCC). Clinically
integrated digital health apps have the potential to more accurately predict post-discharge AEs and improve
communication for patients, their caregivers, and the care team. Such tools can provide individualized risk
assessments of AEs by systematically collecting relevant patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and leveraging
standardized application programming interfaces (API) to combine them with electronic health record (EHR)
data. While patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are increasingly used in ambulatory settings, their use for real-
time symptom monitoring and escalation during transitions from the hospital is novel and potentially
transformative–by both empowering patients to better understand their individualized risks of post-discharge
AEs, and improving monitoring while transitioning out of the hospital. Our proposed intervention is grounded in
evidence-based frameworks for care transitions, and scaling and spread of digital health tools. To inform our
intervention, we propose developing and validating a predictive model of post-discharge AEs for hospitalized
MCC patients using relevant PRO questionnaires and electronic health record (EHR) derived variables. We
will then combine, adapt, extend, and refine our previously developed EHR-integrated hospital and
ambulatory-focused digital health infrastructure to support MCC patients in real-time symptom monitoring
using PROs when transitioning out of the hospital. Our intervention uses interoperable, data exchange
standards and APIs to seamlessly integrate with existing vendor patient portal offerings, thereby addressing
critical gaps and supporting the complete continuum of care. Our multidisciplinary team uses principles of
user-centered design and agile software development to rapidly identify, design, develop, refine, and
implement requirements from patients and clinicians. Our team will rigorously evaluate this intervention in a
large-scale randomized controlled trial in which we compare our real-time symptom monitoring intervention to
usual care for patients with MCCs transitioning out of the hospital. Finally, we will conduct a robust mixed
methods evaluation to generate new knowledge and best practices for disseminating, implementing, and
using this interoperable intervention at similar institutions with different EHR vendors."

Over one-third of adults in the US have obesity, many with comorbidities including hypertension and diabetes.
Comprehensive lifestyle change is the first-line approach to treating obesity, but as many as half of patients are
non-responsive to behavior change interventions, and the majority of initial responders go on to regain lost weight
within 2 years. Pairing lifestyle intervention with an antiobesity medication (AOM) can enhance weight loss and
promote weight loss maintenance. However, despite the recent availability of several AOMs in the US, these
medications are rarely prescribed. Among the small subset of patients who do receive an AOM prescription, the
generic medication Phentermine accounts for 76% of fills. Phentermine is only approved for short-term use, while
current guidelines for treatment of obesity recommend long-term AOM prescribing. Concerns about longer-term
use of phentermine stem from the fact that it can increase heart rate and blood pressure, theoretically increasing
risk of incident cardiovascular disease. Despite these concerns, and despite the pressing need for affordable
and effective long-term obesity pharmacotherapy, there have been no high-quality, randomized controlled trials
of phentermine monotherapy to examine its efficacy, impact on risk factors, or potential adverse events if used
long-term. At 5 centers across the United States, we will conduct the Long-term Effectiveness of the Anti-obesity
medication Phentermine (LEAP) trial—a placebo-controlled, randomized trial, enrolling 1,000 adults with BMI
27-44.9kg/m2. In an intent-to-treat fashion, with all participants provided with an evidence-based online lifestyle
intervention, we will compare participants receiving 24 mg/day of phentermine vs. placebo for up to 24 months.
We will examine co-primary outcomes of percent weight loss and change in systolic blood pressure at 24 months.
Additionally, we will compare between groups changes in drivers of energy balance, including resting metabolic
rate, caloric intake, physical activity and dietary composition. Because weight loss can improve cardiometabolic
health, we will also compare changes in heart rate, hemoglobin A1c, lipids, waist circumference, atherosclerotic
cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk score, and novel ECG markers of cardiac strain. Finally, we will examine
overall adverse event and serious adverse event rate, including rates of incident cardiovascular disease or death.
The potential impact of our findings is large regardless of whether they are positive or negative. If phentermine
were shown to be safe and effective for long-term use in patients with obesity, it could provide an immediately
available low-cost option for weight management. In contrast, if shown ineffective, the trial could reduce off-label
prescribing of the medication and promote a shift to drugs with proven, albeit costly, long-term effectiveness."

Our nation is nearly paralyzed by the twin pandemics of COVID-19 and painful inequities in health outcomes
among COVID-19 infected Americans of differing ethnicities. To help address these, we seek sponsorship to
train the next generation of pandemic and emerging disease researchers in the FRONTIERS IN EMERGING,
RE-EMERGING AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES AND DIVERSITY. FrERZD2 will launch and sustain three vital
undertakings: sophisticated courses for skills development; relevant vital research experiences; and career
mentoring activities. Responsive to PAR-20-289, it is designed for 16 trainees who are graduate and medical
students, medical residents, postdoctoral fellows, and/or early-career faculty, and who also are US citizens or
permanent residents. The week-long course will help to ensure that clinically active scientists (especially
physicians) are able to obtain permission to participate. Too few laboratories are led by under-represented
minority (URM) scientists, and not enough new URM trainees graduate. We seek 5 years of sponsorship to
offer FrERZD2 courses at Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM), an HBCU, in 2021, 2023, and 2025 and
Ponce Health Sciences University (PHSU), a Hispanic-Serving Institution, in 2022 and 2024. Under the
overall directorship of Gerald Schatten from Pittsburgh, along with Jonathan Stiles at MSM, Idhaliz Flores from
PHSU, and Calvin Simerly, also from Pittsburgh, FrERZD2 is overseen by an external scientific advisory
committee. It offers dynamic advanced training courses consisting of daily lectures on emerging concepts,
followed by extended discussion, laboratory research, technologically intense workshops, and informal
seminars. Our similar training programs have recruited participants of whom 34% self-identify as African
American/Black and 30% as Hispanic Americans; 66% are women, and 62% are from URM institutions. Six
specific aims are proposed. Aim 1. Provide conceptual education and experimental training. Aim 2. Provide
background information and self-reflective exercises and demonstrations to understand, appreciate, and
address the historic and current underpinnings of inequities in the research workforce’s diversity and disparities
in health care. Aim 3. Sponsor meaningful mentored research. Aim 4. Discuss career planning. Aim 5.
Educate participants on the responsible conduct of research. Aim 6. Provide unbiased, quantitative,
independent mechanisms to track trainees’ careers, comprehensively and longitudinally. The program’s name,
FRONTIERS IN EMERGING, RE-EMERGING AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES AND DIVERSITY, acknowledges
our hope that the COVID pandemic may soon recede significantly and our realization that other emerging,
reemerging, and zoonotic diseases will arise that must be timely addressed. Overall, in conducting this
program, we will continue to enhance and expand the research careers of the most promising scientists, with
sensitivity to ensuring full diversity in the NIAID workforce."

(WHO’s Global Health Estimates 2020). The Biospecimen Core (BC) will generate high-quality, clinically
annotated, and pathologically evaluated specimens from normal human lung and heart (and corresponding
vessels and lymph nodes) to provide the fundamental basis for the creation of high-resolution, multi-modal, and
multi-dimensional senescence maps. The BC investigators will use their expertise in collecting, processing,
annotating, classifying, and distributing tissue samples and primary cells lines for lung and heart senescence
mapping. The core will excel in providing already catalogued tissues with as little ischemia-induced artifacts as
possible, and meet all legal and ethical standards including broad donor consent. The BC follows NIH/NCI Best
Practices for Biorepositories, with standard operating procedures (SOPs) in place to ensure the highest
biospecimen and clinical information quality to meet all legal and ethical standards. The biorepository efforts are
approved through OSU, Pitt, and URMC IRB protocols that cover the procurement, processing, and distribution
of human biospecimens. The BC will collect whole tissue from humans across the lifespan and will provide whole
tissue, precision cut tissue slices (PCTS), and purified cells to the TriState SenNet TMC. Together with the Data

Candidate: Elissa Kozlov’s career goal is to be an independent investigator dedicated to improving the mental
health outcomes of older adults with serious illness and their families, while establishing herself as a leader in
the field of geriatric mental health care and palliative care. She is a licensed clinical psychologist with expertise
in geriatrics and palliative care, and she has authored 25 peer-reviewed (15 first-authored) manuscripts.
Research: Up to 70% of adults with serious illness have symptoms of anxiety. Undiagnosed and undertreated
anxiety contributes to higher risk of pain, depression, fatigue, dyspnea, and polypharmacy. Patients with high
symptom burden and anxiety heavily impact family caregivers, which nearly 8 million older adults in the U.S.
rely on for assistance. Decades of research reveal the negative effects of caregiving on caregivers, (e.g., high
levels of stress, depression, and anxiety). Furthermore, there is a mutuality of distress in the caregiver/patient
dyad — when patients suffer psychologically, the caregiver suffers too. Unfortunately, older adults and their
caregivers have limited access to mental health resources because of shortages of mental health providers as
well as logistical issues including time constraints, transportation, and scheduling. The objective of this study is
to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of Mindfulness Coach, an mHealth
Mindfulness Therapy intervention developed by the Veterans Affairs, to reduce anxiety in older adults with
serious illness and their family caregivers. An efficacious and scalable behavioral intervention that mitigates
symptoms of patient and caregiver anxiety has the potential to reduce distress and enhance coping in the
patient–caregiver dyad without contributing to polypharmacy or burdensome appointments. Research is
urgently needed to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of dyadic mHealth
mindfulness therapy in older adults with serious illness and their caregivers.
Career Development: Dr. Kozlov has assembled an interdisciplinary team of mentors (Primary: Drs. Dong &
Reid, Mentorship Committee [Israel, Duberstein, and Hoover]) with expertise in geriatrics, mental health,
dissemination and implementation sciences, caregiving, and mHealth. Her career development plan integrates
coursework, seminars, and mentorship in the following areas: (1) Skills in mHealth interventions, data analysis
and clinical trials, 2) Dyadic interventions and analyses in geriatrics and palliative care, 3) Dissemination and
Implementation sciences (D&I), and 4) Leadership and grantsmanship. With support from the Rutgers
University Institute for Health, Health Policy and Aging Research, The School of Public Health and RWJ
Barnabas Healthcare System, Dr. Kozlov is positioned to lead geriatric mental health initiatives that are
supported by rigorous, programmatic research. The proposed research, training, and mentorship plan will
provide Dr. Kozlov with the data, skills and experience needed to become a leader in implementing and
delivering innovative mental health care to older adults with serious illness and their caregivers."
10881760,"Project Summary:
Prostate Cancer (PCa) accounts for ~30000 deaths annually in the USA. There is urgent, yet unmet, need for
identification and characterization of new targets for therapeutic intervention in PCa. Our goal is to address this
vital knowledge gap by characterizing the role of Prostate Derived Ets Transcription Factor (PDEF) in PCa, thereby
reducing the prostate cancer-related deaths. Our central hypotheses are that, “PDEF suppresses CRPC phenotype
and PCa metastasis in part by modulating AR cistrome and in part by restricting lineage plasticity and as such may
help sensitize CRPC men to current therapies”. This novel paradigm, implies that loss of PDEF tumor progression
and therapy resistance in part by allowing re-targeting of AR to non-canonical AR cistrome, and in part by
promoting lineage plasticity and emergence of CRPC, is a groundbreaking conceptual advancement, which holds
translational promise in identifying new therapeutic targets in CRPC, for which there is no cure to date. Our
hypotheses are driven by our novel observations that there is graded decrease in PDEF levels in prostate cancer
cells with increasing aggressive phenotype, and that PDEF inhibits cell migration, invasion in vitro, and tumor
metastasis in vivo. We discovered that PDEF negatively enriches gene sets associated with cell migration and tumor
metastasis. We observed that PDEF inhibits expression of sets of genes associated with EMT, NEPC and Stemness,
and that there is decreased PDEF during PCa progression in experimental (TRAMP) mouse model. Moreover, we
observed that PDEF promotes distinct transcription profiles related with canonical AR cistrome and luminal
differentiation. We now propose to test our hypothesis in three specific aims: AIM 1) To evaluate the role of PDEF
in modulating AR cistrome, AIM 2) To determine the role of PDEF in cellular plasticity and resistance to AR
pathway inhibitors, and; AIM3) To evaluate if prostate cancers with PDEF loss respond more favorably to
combination of AR targeted therapies (Enzalutamide (Enz) and EZH2 inhibitor (EPZ-6438) as compared to Enz
alone. The accomplishment of the goals proposed herein should substantially advance our understanding of the
mechanisms by which PDEF inhibits prostate cancer progression and metastasis. Our proposed investigation is
highly relevant to the mission of VA and is likely to have a significant impact on saving lives of Veterans by
characterizing novel targets for intervention against prostate cancer in the immediate future."
10900572,"The ability to predict when external events will occur, such as anticipating the actions of a predator or the
 availability of food, is critical for survival. Converging computational and experimental work suggests that
 dynamically changing patterns of neural activity, including neural sequences, underlie temporal prediction
 and temporal processing. It is increasingly clear that timing and temporal prediction are highly distributed
 computations, however, there has been little effort to systematically contrast and understand the
 computational tradeoffs between how time is encoded in different brain areas. Furthermore, while
 converging evidence suggests neural sequences in the striatum play a central role in timing, the
 mechanisms underlying the generation of neural sequences remains elusive. Critically, it is not known
 whether neural sequences are actively generated within the striatum or are “driven” by neural sequences
 present in corticostriatal inputs. We propose to address these major gaps in understanding with a
 combination of innovative experimental and computational approaches. Our key hypotheses are that: 1)
 neural sequences in the striatum provide a flexible dynamical regime that allows for temporal scaling, i.e.,
 speeding-up or slowing-down of motor responses, 2) cortical input shapes neural sequence formation in
 the striatum, 3) local inhibitory circuits serve to refine the quality of these sequences in the striatum, and
 4) neural dynamics encoding time are widely distributed throughout the brain but are more accurate in
 certain areas such as the striatum. Our project is anchored in a two-interval timing task in which mice
 learn to associate two cues with different reward delays, and has three major aims. Guided by large-scale
 neural recordings in multiple brain areas we will first develop cortical and striatal recurrent neural network
 models with the goal of understanding which circuit motifs are best suited to generate neural sequences,
 and determining which models best capture the experimentally observed activity patterns. Second, we will
 integrate neural recordings and optogenetic perturbations, together with computational approaches, to
 determine whether neural sequences in the striatum are driven by cortical input and refined by local
 inhibition, or in contrast actively generated within the striatum. Third, we will carry out a high-throughput
 electrophysiological survey of neural activity in multiple brain areas, to identify which areas contain the
 most accurate temporal codes as well as the potential computational tradeoffs between different codes.
RELEVANCE (See instructions):
 By integrating advanced computational and experimental approaches, this collaborative project will
 provide fundamentally new insights about how the mammalian brain is able to predict when external
 events will occur, enabling animals to produce appropriately timed movements that are critical in daily life.
 This work will reveal which brain circuits are most strongly implicated in timing, which is often impaired in
 neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s and Huntington’s disease."
10912479,"8. Project Summary/Abstract
Many proteins access, in addition to their native state, an alternative pathway of folding leading
to the formation of amyloid aggregates. Amyloidogenesis has been linked not only to more than
fifty human diseases but also to functions, which benefit the organism. Once arising, the
amyloid state is perpetuated through the incorporation and conformational conversion of native-
state protein, fragmentation of growing complexes and transmission both within and to other
individuals. These central events are modulated by protein sequence and conformation, protein
quality control pathways, and cell biology. Yet, how these contributing factors and processes
intersect to impact organismal physiology is poorly understood, despite a growing appreciation
of the contributions of amyloid to the biology of systems from yeast to man. This current gap in
knowledge is a critical barrier to progress in the field because we are unable to rationally
explain, predict, exploit, and reverse the link between amyloidogenesis and its physiological
effects. Our long-term goal is to bridge this gap by determining how these inputs are balanced
and disrupted to create and cure dynamic phenotypic states. Toward this end, we are exploiting
prions of Saccharomyces cerevisiae as an outstanding and robust model. Sharing many
characteristics with metazoan amyloids, yeast prions are a naturally evolved system in which
the thresholds separating phenotypic states can be accessed, studied, and traversed under
physiologically relevant conditions. We will exploit dichotomies in yeast prion biology, where the
same event yields distinct outcomes in different contexts, as experimental entryways to
elucidate system balance for the most crucial transitions: prion appearance, interference, curing,
and toxicity. Together, our studies will elucidate the molecular basis of proteostatic niches that
allow amyloid to survive or to be lost and will provide a framework for understanding similar
transitions in higher eukaryotes."

Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are a prevalent diabetes complications affecting up to 35% of people with diabetes.
Considering the continuous increase in diabetes prevalence and incidence reaching pandemic rates worldwide,
the healthcare and socioeconomic impact are staggering, with ~80,000 Americans sustaining non-traumatic
amputations each year, and five-year mortality rates of up to 40%. Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) costs alone are
estimated to add $9 billion-$13 billion per year to the rest of costs to manage diabetes. Additionally, after decades
of sustained decline, most recent evidence show that non-traumatic lower extremity amputations in diabetes are
now on the rise, despite advances in the standards of diabetes care, recognition for the need of interdisciplinary
care teams, and research to target wound care products. Thus, continuing the work and expanding our
accomplishments during the first cycle of the Diabetic Foot Consortium (DFC) Clinical Research Unit to validate
and implement sensitive DFUs biomarkers at the point of care cannot be understated.
The main objectives of the DFU Clinical Research Unit (CRU) at the University of Michigan are to expand the
work and activities initiated during the first cycle by integrating the robust DFC infrastructure we built at Michigan
with the highly skilled clinical and translational research team to: finalize the ongoing DFU biomarkers protocols;
implement the DFC master protocol and its various substudies; continue our high recruitment performance
across all ongoing and new biomarker studies; recruit, train and supervise satellite sub sites; develop new
methods to stimulate participants engagement and adherence; refine large and standardized biological, imaging,
and clinical samples collections, including patient reported outcomes and social determinants of health; analyze
how DFU recommended standards of care are implemented into usual care; active and effective participation in
DFC self-governing committees. Additionally, will participate in biomarker validation analyses and apply novel
discovery tools and analyses including machine learning techniques through a multidisciplinary approach to
identify new phenotyping, genomic, molecular and microbiome biomarkers from all DFUs biosamples and wound
images to be implemented at point of care. We will also leverage the large and diverse pool of people with
diabetes foot complications that receive care at the entire University of Michigan Health System, enabling us to
recruit for any ongoing and new DFU studies proposed in the renewal. Our continuous participation as a DFC
CRU, will enable us to build upon the state-of -the-art infrastructure, and the high record of success and
leadership we established over the past four years to continue to impact progress in all facets of DFUs from
research, to personalized treatment implementation and prevention, ultimately contributing to the great success
of the entire DFC network."

member. We enrich this research experience with regular group meetings to discuss research and develop
presentation skills, introduction to core concepts in cancer biology, emerging cancer biology research topics
and cancer research career pathways, and the development of professional skills critical for admission to and
success in a graduate program. Based on our ability to recruit a talented and diverse cohort of students, and
outstanding student outcomes in the initial funding period, we are requesting continued support for the
CREATE program. We will recruit 18 students each year, with 6 students participating in a novel “MSTP track”
where students will be mentored by a physician scientist and participate in additional MD/PhD-specific
enrichment activities. The rationale for this new track is based on success with a pilot in the previous funding
period, and the need to increase and diversify the physician scientist pipeline. For all CREATE students, we
have used our evaluation results to revise our cancer biology-specific activities, provide mentor training to all
program participants, and focus our professional development activities on supporting and enhancing
mentoring relationships, writing personal statements and interviewing. New initiatives in our diversity
recruitment plan will allow us to continue to recruit a high percentage of students from underrepresented
backgrounds. The CREATE program benefits from strong partnerships with the University of Minnesota
Masonic Cancer Center and the Medical Scientist Training Program (MD/PhD). We work extensively with the
Life Sciences Summer Undergraduate Research Programs, a long-standing umbrella organization that
coordinates the activities of several distinct summer research programs at Minnesota. This relationship
enhances our recruitment efforts, maximizes administrative efficiencies, and provides additional enrichment
activities that complement and enhance CREATE. Continuous quality improvement driven by our evaluation
plan will allow us to continue to enhance the student experience and positively impact short-term and long-term
measures of success."
10908520,"The ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 is designated by World Health Organization (WHO) as a Public Health
Emergency of International Concern. Similarities among ACE2 receptors predict that there are several animals
could function as reservoirs for the virus. Recent studies by us and others identified felid animals, including
domestic cats, tigers and lions as highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. These findings cause great
concerns on the potential for human to animal and animal to human transmission, along with the virus
mutations that appear as the virus goes back and forth between species. One goal of this study is to design
and prepare novel reagents and assays for detection and surveillance in animals. A second goal is to
develop a feline animal model. Together, these data will be incorporated into models for understanding
the risk of animal infection for veterinarians, other animal care professionals, and the general public.
Specific Aims are: 1). To generate and characterize specific reagents for use in COVID-19 research and
diagnostics; 2). To develop diagnostic assays for detecting COVID-19 virus infection in animals; 3). To
establish a feline model to study SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis; 4). To apply novel diagnostic assays in the
surveillance of pets and zoo animal populations. Outcomes of this study will generate a panel of SARS-CoV-
2-specific antibody reagents, diagnostic standards, and assays for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection in
all species of animals. The diagnostic assays will be applied to COVID-19 surveillance networks, which will
identify important animal reservoirs. The novel serological assay can also serve as a DIVA test to differentiate
between the vaccinated and infected animals (and humans). The feline pathogenesis studies will improve our
understanding of viral pathogenic mechanisms, host immune responses, and provide the source of samples for
early detection and test validation."
10909063,"Abstract
Two significant paradigm shifts are underway in cancer genomics: single-cell genomic profiling and the growth
of the NCI Cancer Research Data Commons. Single-cell genomics is transforming our understanding of
complex tumor populations and revealing new insights into tumor composition, microenvironment, cancer stem
cells, and drug resistance. Several large-scale, single-cell-focused, national and international projects are
currently underway, including HCA, HTAN, and HuBMAP. Data generated by these projects will impact almost
every aspect of biology and medicine. For these projects to realize their full potential,
it is essential to have
data visualization and analysis tools that make these resources accessible
to a broad group of biomedical
researchers. This is challenging, however, as existing data visualization and analysis tools simply cannot scale
to handle these large datasets. The second paradigm shift is NCI’s development of the Cancer Research Data
Commons (CRDC), a virtual data science infrastructure that connects cancer research data collections with
analytical tools, leveraging the dynamic computing power of the cloud. Efficient and secure incorporation of
widely-used 3rd party tools and platforms, including interactive visualization tools such as UCSC Xena, into
CRDC is needed to make this resource truly useful. As both of these transitions continue to accelerate in the
coming years, they present challenges and opportunities. We propose to enhance UCSC Xena to support and
enable these transitions through four aims. Aim 1. We will scale up UCSC Xena by 100x to support the
visualization of datasets with greater than 1 million cells (more generally, 1 million bio-entities) without any loss
of data or interactivity in the web browser. We will employ several new advances in computer engineering to
achieve this performance gain. In addition, we will develop three new visualizations to enable researchers to
better explore single-cell data. Aim 2. We will securely integrate UCSC Xena with resources in the NCI CRDC
and its community of data analysis tools and platforms. Our integration will make loading ending analysis
results into a private Xena Hub in CRDC for visualization in the context of large public data a routine practice.
Aim 3. We will provide visualization of the most current cancer genomics resource data through the expansion
and update of UCSC Xena database with key projects and datasets. We will collaborate with the Treehouse
Childhood Cancer Initiative to build a harmonized preclinical pediatric genomics data resource and make it
publicly available on the Xena Browser. This work will leverage PDX models and brain tumor organoids
currently being developed and profiled by Dr. Haussler’s group. Aim 4. We will improve user workflows and
engagement through User Centered Design, as well as continue user education, support, and outreach."
10898924,"Invasive fungal infections are a major cause of co-morbidity and mortality in patients living with immunodeficiency and transplantation. A limited antifungal arsenal and emergence of antifungal drug resistance have made the need for novel antifungal therapies paramount. Cellular protein synthesis carried out by the ribosome is a known and well-vetted target for pharmaceutical intervention in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, but has not been exploited in antifungal development because of the presumed inability to target the core catalytic function of the ribosome with specificity in fungi. Using the human pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans, we have leveraged two approaches to identify factors that associate with the fungal ribosome under stress conditions encountered in the host. Using a homology based approach, we have identified Cryptococcus-specific homologues of the conserved eukaryotic mRNA cap-binding complex (eIF4F) that we have names alternative eIF4G (AFG1) and alternative eIF4E (AFE1). Deletion of AFG1 results impairs hypoxia adaptation, which is a major pathogenesis-associated pathway in the major human fungal pathogens. Further work on the function of Afg1 and Afe1 as components of a novel eIF4F complex are outlined in Aim 1, and the identification of the mRNA targets they bind is outlined in Aim 3. Our second approach developed a novel proteomic pipeline that we’ve termed RiboPROT to identify the factors associating with translating ribosomes during adaptation to temperature stress and oxidative stress. Aim 2 of this proposal will investigate the role of these proteins in stress-responsive translation and pathogenesis. We have prioritized hits from our initial RiboPROT experiments to investigate further, and propose to identify additional factors under additional conditions relevant to cryptococcal pathogenesis and biology. For those with RNA-binding domains, cognate mRNA targets will be identified in Aim 3, identifying stress responsive translational regulons. At the conclusion of these studies, we will have a comprehensive set of ribosome-associating factors to investigate in future work as antifungal targets. These unique stress-specific and fungi-specific ribosome-associating factors may provide a novel pathway to targeting the fungal ribosome with specificity."
10898048,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Tuberculosis (TB) remains the global leading cause of death from an infectious agent. Understanding
why some patients present with early symptoms while others develop latent infections is critical for combating
this illness. While environmental factors are known to elevate the risk of early progression, a recent Genome
Wide Association Study revealed that host genetic factors also play a role, with early progression heritability
near 20%. However, TB genetics studies focusing on Europeans, which have dominated the field, suffer from
linkage disequilibrium obscuring causal loci and fail to center on the populations who suffer most from TB. By
contrast, this project will focus on a population from Lima, Peru with high TB burden and admixed ancestry,
which will reveal a broader range of genetic variants and enable more specific mapping of impactful loci. Early
progression risk is likely dictated by the immune response, the primary host-pathogen interface. Therefore,
using transcriptional profiling of monocytes (in bulk) and T cells (as single cells) in combination with genotyping
and environmental covariate data, the objective of this project is to characterize immune phenotypes altered by
genomic background that influence TB progression risk. Specifically, this project will: Aim 1) identify gene
expression immune phenotypes influenced by genetic ancestry, Aim 2) create a novel single-cell analysis
method and use it to identify cell population immune phenotypes influenced by genetic ancestry, and Aim 3)
identify specific genomic variants that alter immune phenotypes and impact TB progression risk. If successful,
this work will elucidate genomic mechanisms influencing TB infection outcomes and deepen our understanding
of immune physiology in a Peruvian population. Knowledge of genetic factors that prevent early progression
can inform the development of therapeutics and vaccines. This work will also produce a powerful method for
association testing in single cell datasets, Covarying Neighborhood Analysis, that can define with great
flexibility and granularity cell populations whose abundance is altered by a clinical phenotype of interest.
 Through the fellowship training plan, the applicant will develop: expertise in complex trait genetics,
fluency in the application of and development of bioinformatic methodologies, an understanding of how social
and environmental factors also contribute to infectious disease outcomes, and familiarity with immune
physiology and clinical aspects of infectious disease management. An ideal training environment of close
mentorship by an expert in complex trait genetics of immune-mediated diseases and single-cell methods
development, plus support from a network of advisors with complementary scientific expertise and career
experience in academic medicine, in combination with exposure to relevant coursework and meetings, will
enable the applicant to thrive in this program of study. At the conclusion of this fellowship, the applicant will be
poised to tackle critical problems in computational immune genetics with applications to infectious diseases
and global health, and to bridge the clinical and computational worlds through a career in academic medicine."
10911104,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The purpose of this Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) is to help the candidate, Dr.
Jessie Ford, become an independent researcher focused on identifying modifiable multi-level factors that can
explain and address the high rates of alcohol-involved sexual assault within bisexual women (BW) across the
lifespan in the US. Today, as many as 8-14% of women identify as bisexual. Research shows that BW are over
three times more likely to have experienced alcohol-facilitated sexual assault than heterosexual women (24.4%
vs. 7.6%), and that rates of hazardous drinking are higher for BW than for heterosexual women. Thus, it is
imperative to study how alcohol interacts with other social forces to create risk in order to prevent the high
rates of sexual assault among this growing demographic group. In order to examine this topic, the candidate
requires training in each of the following areas: 1) risk and protective factors for hazardous drinking; (2)
lifespan research methods for alcohol use and sexual assault; (3) conceptualizing and measuring multi-level
determinants of lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) alcohol use; and (4) mixed methods. Training will occur
alongside a career development plan that includes specific seminars, workshops, coursework, conferences,
hands-on practica, and tailored mentoring with a mentorship team comprised of experts in alcohol use, lifespan
and longitudinal research methods, determinants of LGB health, minority stress, risk taking, sexual assault,
mixed methods, bisexual health, and advanced statistical methods. The candidate will use this new training
data to build a novel conceptual model describing BW's disproportionate risk for alcohol-involved sexual
assault, with attention to the multi-level effects of individual, interpersonal, and structural factors across the
lifespan. To test this model, I will utilize a multi-method design across 3 studies that draw on the
methodological strengths of longitudinal cohort, multi-site cross-sectional, and mixed-methods data. These
datasets include: 1) the Chicago Health and Life Experiences of Women Study (CHLEW), 21-year study of 181
BW (ages 18-84); 2) the Online College Social Life Survey (OCSLS), a multi-site study of 638 BW (ages 18-25)
at 22 universities; and 3) my own primary data: The Bisexual Women, Alcohol and Sexual Health (BWASH) 2-
wave survey of 800 BW in a US general population sample. Further, the candidate will conduct 30 in-depth
interviews with BW recruited from the BWASH sample, integrating survey data with qualitative data to further
elucidate mechanisms. This research will provide critical formative data that will be used to develop a NIAAA
R01 proposal that will allow Dr. Ford to create a prospective dataset to identify multi-level etiologic pathways
(all in 1 dataset) that affect alcohol use and sexual health for BW. The new skills acquired through this K01 will
help the candidate achieve her career goal of becoming an independent investigator who conducts
transformative, cross-disciplinary work that advances research on determinants of alcohol use and adverse
sexual health outcomes."
10909877,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Reducing maternal morbidity and mortality is a clinical and public health priority in the United States (US).
Substantial research, public health, and clinical efforts focus on reducing morbidity and mortality thought to be
due to or aggravated by pregnancy, specifically hemorrhage, hypertension, and venous thromboembolism.
However, deaths due to drugs (both illicit and prescription), suicide, and homicide are increasing and may be
equally as common among pregnant women and new mothers. It is currently almost impossible to calculate
national estimates of pregnancy-associated deaths due to drug use, suicide, and homicide, because the
checkbox used to identify these deaths on US death certificates has been shown to undercount cases by 50%
or more. We also know little about trends or disparities in these deaths, morbidity due to similar causes that
does not result in death, or risk factors for drug use, self-harm, and violence during pregnancy and postpartum.
The overall goals of our proposed R01 are to provide the first population-based estimates of incidence,
trends, and disparities in mortality and morbidity during pregnancy and the first year postpartum due to drug
use, self-harm, and violence, and to ascertain which factors can identify women at high risk of these outcomes
in a hospital-based setting. Our first aim is to provide comprehensive national estimates on incidence, trends,
and disparities in pregnancy-associated mortality due to drugs, suicide, and homicide in the US between 2007-
2021, adjusted for misclassification arising from errors in the pregnancy checkbox method. Our second aim is
to determine incidence, trends, and disparities in pregnancy-associated morbidity due to drugs, self-harm, and
violence. Our third aim is to investigate whether hospital or ED service utilization and diagnoses during
pregnancy or at delivery can be used to identify women at high risk of future postpartum morbidity and
mortality due to drugs, self-harm, or violence. To achieve these aims, we will use a unique set of linked
California databases that will allow us to quantify misclassification of pregnancy-associated mortality and
apply an innovative bias adjustment to national estimates of pregnancy-associated mortality due to
drugs, suicide, and homicide. This dataset will further allow us to estimate pregnancy-associated
morbidity due to drug use, self-harm, and violence using a novel linkage approach that follows mothers
forward in time from their pregnancy or delivery, and to identify hypothesized antecedent risk factors (“red
flags”) for such morbidity and mortality that could create new opportunities for intervention and prevention.
The proposed research will extend the current knowledge base in research on maternal morbidity and
mortality to encompass non-obstetric causes that are likely of substantial and growing importance. Achieving
our aims will change clinical practice by finding ways to identify women at high risk for future morbidity and
mortality due to drug use, self-harm, and violence and lay the foundation for future research developing
preventive strategies."
10914085,"To build and diversify a workforce that meets the nation’s biomedical, behavioral and clinical research
needs, the NIH invests in projects that provide science and health-related educational activities at the
precollege level. These projects focus on students and teachers at the pre-kindergarten to grade 12 (P-12)
level—as well as their families—who come from underserved communities.
 The annual NIH SciEd Conference brings together individuals involved in these health and biomedical
science-focused P-12 Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) projects. This conference, which
originally was the PI meeting for the Science Education Partnership Award (SEPA) program, has been held
annually since 1991. In 2012, the conference expanded to include awardees and staff from all NIH-funded P-
12 STEM programs. Each year 200-250 individuals participate in the conference, including PIs and Co-PIs,
project staff and evaluators, P-12 teachers who participate in projects, NIH staff, and representatives of
other federal agencies involved in P-12 STEM education, including ED, NASA, NOAA and NSF. The
annual NIH SciEd Conference is the only federally-funded P-12 STEM meeting that includes all of the key
STEM agency programs. It thus plays an important role in interagency communication and building synergistic
interactions among projects funded by different agencies.
 The goal of each 2.5-day NIH SciEd conference is to provide a forum for learning, sharing, dialogue, and
networking among conference participants. This is accomplished via plenary, breakout, poster, and networking
sessions. The outcomes of the conferences include higher quality projects and project evaluations, a reduced
incidence of projects “reinventing the wheel,” and the development of collaborations between NIH-funded
projects as well as synergistic interactions with P-12 projects and programs funded by the other federal STEM
agencies. Specific Aims for the NIH SciEd Conference are:
SPECIFIC AIM 1: Provide updates on trends, issues and challenges in P-12 STEM and ISE education
 that are relevant to NIH awardees.
SPECIFIC AIM 2: Inform and educate the NIH P-12 STEM community about rigorous evaluation
 methods and instruments.
SPECIFIC AIM 3: Provide opportunities for awardees to share information, best practices and
 challenges; provide mentoring for new projects; and support the formation of collaborations.
 The conferences will be held in the Washington, DC area. They are planned by an Organizing Committee
of NIH SciEd PIs and staff, which changes each year. An annual conference report is disseminated to
participants, federal P-12 STEM staff, and senior NIH officials. The conferences will be organized by a
University of Utah grantee team that has planned and hosted the NIH SciEd conferences since 2008."
10888366,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a highly contagious airborne pathogen that infects > 2 billion people, of whom
an estimated 1.5 million people per year are killed by the disease. The global spread of multi-drug
resistant (MDR), extensively-drug resistant (XDR), and totally drug resistant (TDR) strains of
tuberculosis emphasizes the great need for new effective treatments. This renewal/Merit Award
application capitalizes on the discovery of hits against two critical targets in Mycobacterium
tubersuolsis – the imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-3-carboxamides and the imidazo[2,1-b]pyridine-5-
carboxamides that target QcrB and novel scaffolds that target complimentary BD oxidase –
and seeks to advance these to potential TB treatments. As the first to patent, prolifically publish,
and propose the mechanism of action for the imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-3-carboxamide (IAPC) series,
we are the most experienced group to continue development of this series through primate
evaluation in preparation for clinical (human) studies. Additionally, we have disclosed the impressive
in vitro properties of imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole 5-carboxamide (IT) series a new promising, rationally
designed, scaffold we will continue to develop. This new class has low nanomolar antiTB activity
against H37Rv, multidrug resistant (MDR) and extreme drug resistant (XDR) Mtb as well as good in
vitro metabolism and in vivo exposure with greater lung to plasma ratios. Most recently, we have
discovered a small molecule inhibitor of cytochrome bd oxidase in Mtb. A functional redundancy
between the cytochrome bcc:aa3 and the cytochrome bd oxidase protects M. tuberculosis from the
preclinical imidazopyridine (Q203)-induced bacterial death, highlighting the attractiveness of the bd-
type terminal oxidase for drug development. Combination of our QcrB and bd oxidase inhibitor is
bactericidal against replicating, nutrient-starved and hypoxic antibiotic-tolerant mycobacteria and
showed increased efficacy in a mouse model of infection. These results indicate that further
complementary development of a compound scaffold inhibiting the cytochrome bd oxidase will
enhance the value of a drug combination targeting oxidative phosphorylation for treatment of
tuberculosis.
 Furthermore, all of these heterocyclic scaffolds (IAPC, IT and bd oxidase inhibitor) can be prepared
in bulk (50 – 100 g) inexpensively and, from these penultimate intermediates, lead compounds with
animal efficacy can be prepared in just one synthetic step (amide bond formation or nucleophilic
aromatic substitution) and in multi-gram quantities (>15 g). Through our extensive collaborations,
we will evaluate all samples and combinations for antiTB activity. We will also perform related
studies, including microbe selectivity, gross toxicity particularly looking to avoid mitochondrial
toxicity, metabolism, pharmacokinetics (PK), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), mice and/or monkey
efficacy and mode of action studies of any new compounds with promising activity and
physicochemical attributes including metabolite identification. Our criteria for a clinical candidate
are: selective nanomolar potency against H37Rv and drug resistant Mtb, in vivo efficacy comparable
to first line drugs isoniazid and rifampicin (at a dose <100 mg/kg), low toxicity (at least 10x over
effective dose), minimal drug-drug interactions, good aqueous solubility (>100 g/mL) and synthetic
simplicity/cost effectiveness. A highly qualified team of coworkers and collaborators from
experienced laboratories has been assembled to accomplish the overarching goal of
providing the TB-research and biomedical communities a promising new anti-tb drug
treatment as well as validated new drug targtes (respiratory bc1 complex bd oxidase of Mtb).

10846802,"The anti-apoptotic BCL2 family proteins (including BCL2, BCLXL, and MCL1) act by neutralizing BAX and BAK,
and by inhibiting the BH3-only pro-apoptotic proteins that can activate BAX/BAK. BH3-mimetics are drugs that
enhance apoptosis by binding to and inhibiting BCL2, BCLXL, or MCL1. Navitoclax inhibits BCL2 and BCLXL
and has single-agent activity in hematological malignancies, but causes thrombocytopenia due to BCLXL
inhibition. A BCL2-specific BH3-mimetic that spares platelets, venetoclax, is similarly active and FDA approved
for several hematological malignancies. Unfortunately, these currently clinically available BH3-mimetics have
limited single agent activity in most solid tumors, which appears to substantially reflect a greater role for MCL1.
BH3 mimetic drugs that inhibit MCL1 have more recently been developed and are in early trials, but preclinical
studies from us and others suggest that it will in most cases be necessary to inhibit both BCLXL and MCL1 to
achieve robust apoptotic responses, and it is likely that toxicity will limit the ability to combine BCL2/BCLXL and
MCL1 inhibitors in patients. Although BH3 mimetics have limited efficacy as single agents in PC, they may have
activity in subsets of PC with genomic alterations affecting apoptotic pathways. We recently identified the
mitochondrial ubiquitin ligase MARCH5 as the primary mediator MCL1 degradation in response to cellular stress,
and found that MARCH5 gene deletion that occurs in up to ~5% of CRPC can sensitize to BH3 mimetic drugs.
Other alterations that increase MCL1 expression (including MCL1 gene amplification) are also frequent in PC
and can confer increased MCL1 dependence. Conversely, our preliminary data indicate that PC with
BRCA2/RB1 loss may be highly dependent on BCLXL. Based on these data, Aim 1 is to identify and characterize
genomic alterations that may be used as robust biomarkers for clinical trials of single agent BH3 mimetic therapy.
While a subset of PC may be responsive to single agent BH3 mimetic drugs, fully exploiting these drugs will
likely require the identification of synergistic combination therapies. Indeed, we have previously identified a
number of available drugs that can markedly enhance MCL1 degradation and sensitize to navitoclax. Therefore,
Aim 2 is to identify combination therapies that exploit BH3 mimetic agents to drive apoptotic responses in CRPC.
Finally, we hypothesize that castration-sensitive prostate cancer (CSPC) cells exposed to intensive androgen
signaling inhibition may have a reduced apoptotic threshold and be vulnerable, at least transiently, to the addition
of a BH3 mimetic drug. Therefore, Aim 2 will also determine whether BH3 mimetics can be used to exploit
vulnerabilities generated acutely by intensive ASI in CSPC. Overall, we hypothesize that BH3 mimetic drugs will
be highly effective in a subset of genetically defined CRPCs, and more broadly in combination with other targeted
agents. The Specific Aims are 1) Identify genomic alterations in prostate cancer that sensitize to BH3 mimetic
drugs and 2) Identify BH3 mimetic combination therapies that are effective in prostate cancer"

methods, and in coordination with the FIRST Coordination and Evaluation Center, multi-level outcomes
(individual, mentors, department, institution) including an evaluation of scientific impact of the FIRST Faculty
hires. The efforts of the EC are grounded in theoretical frameworks reflecting equity, inclusivity and
intersectionality, and are guided by a logic model conceptualizing our change efforts, the activities planned to
contribute to desired changes, the immediate outputs and ultimate outcomes that will be tracked and
documented. Specifically the EC will: (1) work closely with the designated FIRST “Coordination and Evaluation
Center” to help design and implement a uniform and systematic core data set across FIRST Program
awardees; (2) develop and implement an evaluation strategy specific to Drexel FIRST Program activities; (3)
provide formative evaluative reports to the Coordination and Evaluation Center and our Administrative and
Faculty Development Cores to inform programmatic adjustments and improvements; and (4) evaluate impacts
at multiple levels (individual FIRST faculty hire, department, college and institution) of Drexel’s FIRST Cohort
hires on outcomes ranging from individual ratings of inclusivity and social isolation to organizational readiness
and climate. Furthermore, we will evaluate scientific impact of FIRST faculty in advancing the science of health
disparities research using the National Institute of Minority Health and Disparities framework to identify
domains and levels addressed in their scholarship. Finally, as our long-term goal is to sustain a research
culture of inclusive excellence, the EC will establish an approach including tracking tools for continuous
institutional self-assessment, analysis and feedback, assuring accountability and integration of the FIRST
Program into the fabric of institutional life at Drexel during the life of the grant and thereafter. The specific aims
of the Evaluation Core are: (1) To characterize and track the various components that compose the FIRST
program at Drexel University; (2) To evaluate the impact of the FIRST program at Drexel on institutional
outcomes including organizational research climate and implementation and adoption of FIRST strategies,
policies, and processes to promote inclusive excellence; (3) To evaluate the impact of the FIRST program at
Drexel on outcomes defined at the level of the hiring academic units and the new faculty hires themselves,
including unit culture, mentoring environment, sponsorship, other cohort experiences (social isolation, support)
and career progression opportunities including productivity as reflected in publications, presentations,
collaborative opportunities, grant submissions and funding successes; and (4) To evaluate the impact of the
FIRST Cohort on advancing the science of health disparities research. Importantly, the EC will provide a
summative evaluation as to whether we have achieved the goal of inclusive excellence of the Drexel FIRST
Program and how it can be sustained beyond funding."
10927405,"PROJECT SUMMARY- ADMINISTRATIVE CORE.
 The Mississippi Center for Clinical and Translational Research (MCCTR) was established in 2016 as a
collaborative venture among three institutional partners: Tougaloo College, the University of Southern
Mississippi, and the University of Mississippi Medical Center, The MCCTR has subsequently formed an
integrated research resource network, creating the infrastructure to address the substantial health burden and
health disparities that exist in Mississippi.
 The organizational structure and leadership have clear lines of authority and responsibility and ensure close
monitoring of MCCTR progress and milestones. The leadership of the MCCTR, Joey Granger, PhD, who serves
as PI and Director, and Michael Hall, MD, MS, who serves as Director of Clinical and Population Research, have
worked closely with its Internal Advisory Committee (IAC) and External Advisory Committee (EAC) to leverage
existing research support and authority, optimize communication, and build on existing strengths. The constant
interchange of ideas and suggestions between the MCCTR leadership, EAC and IAC and the Tracking and
Evaluation Core during Years 1-4 of has led to significant improvements in MCCTR operations.
 Moving forward, the MCCTR will increase focus on implementation science and clinical and behavioral
interventions to address the disparities associated with obesity- and cardiometabolic-related disorders in
Mississippi, where these health indicators are among the worst in the nation. Specifically, MCCTR will focus on
these Mississippi populations: African Americans, people living in rural areas, and those who are economically
disadvantaged.
 To achieve this goal, MCCTR will also greatly expand its reach in the next funding cycle by adding strengths,
diversity and resources for clinical and translational (C/T) research by establishing new partnerships with the
University of Mississippi-Oxford campus and Mississippi State University—the two largest universities in the
state. MCCTR's impact on C/T research will also be greatly enhanced by inclusion of four CTSA/CTR Consortium
partners: the Louisiana Clinical and Translational Science Center (LACaTS), the Mayo Clinic Center for Clinical
and Translational Science (CCaTS), and our new partners: the University of Alabama-Birmingham Center for
Clinical and Translational Science (UAB-CCTS) and Northwestern University Clinical and Translational Sciences
Institute (NUCATS). MCCTR's in-state institutional partners and its consortium partners will be fully integrated
into the MCCTR through participation in its cores and working groups, through funding provided to Mississippi-
based investigators by its Pilot Projects Program and Professional Development Core, support from its
Community Engagement and Outreach Core, Research Services Core, and Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and
Research Design Core, and by representation on the MCCTR Steering Committee and Advisory Committees."
10927406,"PROJECT SUMMARY - PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT CORE. Mississippi has perhaps the greatest
need for strong clinical and translational (C/T) research programs in the country. We have the highest rates of
obesity and associated chronic diseases in the nation and tremendous opportunities to better understand the
causes and consequences of these diseases, especially in our large minority population which suffers from a
high rate of poverty, inadequate access to health care, and major health care disparities. The Professional
Development Core (PDC) of the Mississippi Center for Translational Research (MCCTR) will help address
Mississippi's health challenges by increasing the number of clinical and translational (C/T) investigators and
health care providers with sustainable research programs focused on chronic diseases and health outcomes. A
consortium of 5 Mississippi institutions along with CTR/CTSA institutions in Alabama, Louisiana, Minnesota,
and Illinois has been developed to provide new opportunities for synergistic, multidisciplinary research
collaborations in large, diverse patient populations as well as unique training programs for early stage
investigators (ESIs). In Phase II, the PDC will enhance the Clinical/Translational Research Scholars (CTRS)
Program, the Master of Science in Clinical Investigation Program, and Pipeline C/T Research Training
Programs to increase the number of and diversity of independent, highly productive C/T researchers focused
on important chronic diseases in Mississippi. The PDC will also enhance the Mentor Academy for ESIs and
mid-career faculty members to become more effective researchers and career mentors. The PDC has
developed several new programs, including a Faculty Exchange and Training Program (FETP), to promote
transdisciplinary and multi-institutional collaborations among MCCTR investigators and external CTR/CTSA
partner institutions. The FETP, along with a MCCTR-COBRE seminar series and frequent Work-in-Progress
meetings of investigators in the MCCTR and collaborating institutions will provide unique opportunities for
team-based C/T research and for improving the health of the people they serve. A new MCCTR Faculty
Recruitment Program has also been developed to more rapidly increase the number of established C/T
researchers in Mississippi who have demonstrated excellent mentoring skills, success of obtaining extramural
research funding, and expertise in emerging technologies, epidemiology, outcomes and community-engaged
research, and bioinformatics where there are currently gaps in MCCTR faculty expertise. Through these new
initiatives created, organized, and delivered by the MCCTR, Mississippi will have its first ever state-wide
initiative designed to build coordinated and synergistic programs among all of its major academic institutions,
focused exclusively on increasing Mississippi's C/T science workforce and improving health care of its people."

research to improve the health of Mississippians. Appropriately powered, well-designed studies with rigorous
analytics are critical to accomplishing these goals. The BERD Core is the central resource for expertise in clinical
research design, epidemiology, and biostatistics for the MCCTR and its partner institutions. During the next
funding cycle, the BERD Core will continue to support MCCTR investigators and will expand support for the
translational research spectrum, including bench science, randomized clinical trials, and community-based
research. The BERD Core will provide statistical review of all applications for MCCTR support, helping to ensure
that funded proposals will produce clear and interpretable results. The BERD core will also provide full support
to all MCCTR-funded investigators, helping them design clinical, translational, and community-based studies,
and prepare grant applications based on the results of their MCCTR-supported research. These activities of the
BERD Core will increase the quality of applications for MCCTR support, ensure that funding is targeted toward
studies that are most likely to succeed, produce will-trained investigators with efficient and successful research
projects, enhance resources for clinical, translational and community-based epidemiologic studies, and promote
the success of MCCTR investigators in producing high-impact scientific results and obtaining sustained
extramural funding."
10927411,"PROJECT SUMMARY – COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND OUTREACH CORE. The Mississippi Center for
Clinical and Translational Research (MCCTR) Community Engagement and Outreach (CEO) Core seeks to build
on its past successes by (1) increasing its presence within the State of Mississippi through additional partners
and the number of geographic regions in which it works; (2) establishing and administering a MCCTR Practice-
Based Research Network (PBRN); (3) extending its influence in developing the careers of faculty members
focusing on community-based participatory research; and (4) improving the quality and quantity of community-
engaged research initiatives, both within Mississippi and throughout the nation. The CEO Core will be co-led by
faculty members representing three of its partner institutions: Caroline Compretta, PhD (University of Mississippi
Medical Center); Holly Huye, PhD (University of Southern Mississippi); and Wendy White, PhD (Tougaloo
College).
 Supporting their efforts will be an expanded Community Advisory Board, along with taskforces and ad hoc
content-specific teams to more efficiently accommodate (1) effective development and delivery of CEO Core
initiatives; (2) timely responses to MCCTR and CEO Core stakeholders and community members; and (3)
enhancements to professional development initiatives for investigators pursuing community-engaged research.
A significant expansion of the CEO Core activities will be the participation of the Mississippi State University
Extension Service (MSES) on the CEO Core's Translational Communication Taskforce, co-led by David Buys,
PhD. Additionally, Victor Sutton, PhD, Director of the Mississippi State Department of Health's Office of
Preventive Health and Health Equity will co-lead the Translational CEnR Taskforce, and Lauren Bloodworth,
PharmD, from the University of Mississippi Oxford campus, will co-lead the PBRN Working Group Taskforce.
 The CEO Core will work closely with the MCCTR's other cores and its Pilot Projects Program to achieve the
following specific aims: (1) Enhance and extend outreach activities to engage relevant community groups,
researchers, MSES agents, and MCCTR stakeholders to identify and address community health priorities in rural
and health disparate populations; (2) Extend research capacity within community-academic partnerships by
providing training on community-based participatory research principles that focus on active engagement with
Mississippi's urban and rural communities; (3) Establish and promote a CEO Core
“Community/Academic/Clinical/Research Network” to facilitate bidirectional communication and research
opportunities among stakeholders, including the MCCTR PBRN, addressing community health issues in rural
and health disparate populations."
10927412,"PROJECT SUMMARY- PILOT PROJECTS PROGRAM. Central to realizing the MCCTR's purpose of
expanding Mississippi's capacity for clinical, translational, and community research is its Pilot Projects Program
(PPP). The PPP supports clinical, translational, and population research projects that will become the basis for
competitive extramural funding applications. During Phase I, key considerations in awarding support to early
stage investigators included the (1) likelihood of attracting extramural funding, (2) evidence of a path toward an
independent research career for the applicant, and (3) probability that the research program would lead to
improved management of obesity or obesity-related diseases. Additional considerations included support for
ethnic and gender diversity, promoting multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional research projects, and equitable
distribution of resources across the MCCTR partner institutions. During Phase II, the breadth of PPP's initiatives
will be expanded in several ways. First, the focus of our pilot project awards will be expanded to include health
conditions such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular and renal disease, cancer, infectious diseases, and
maternal health, all of which are disproportionally prevalent in rural and economically disadvantaged areas of
our state. Second, the number of institutions of higher learning eligible to participate in open solicitation for
applications will be expanded to include Tougaloo College, University of Southern Mississippi, the University of
Mississippi Medical Center, and our new members, Mississippi State University and the University of Mississippi
in Oxford. Third, a new funding program that provides up to $5,000 in seed money to support multi-institutional
collaboration and preliminary data collection for development of a subsequent proposal to the PPP and
elsewhere will be introduced. The PPP will solicit applications for funding two times per year to support
investigator-initiated clinical and translational research of priority health areas within Mississippi, including
community-engaged research addressing Mississippi's health disparities and access-to-care issues, with the
expectation of funding up to seven pilot projects per year. Applications for the seed grant program will be solicited
four times per year through an expedited application and review process. For all programs, studies addressing
health disparities and medically underserved populations with an emphasis on implementation will be prioritized.
The PPP and its related programs will lead to support for multi-institutional and multi-disciplinary collaborative
research among strong investigators from diverse academic and cultural backgrounds. Overall, this approach
will lead to a broad-based, state-wide research platform that has the capacity to improve health outcomes and
address health disparities across Mississippi."
10927415,"PROJECT SUMMARY – TRACKING AND EVALUATION CORE. Systematic and continuous feedback is
central to the success of the Mississippi Center for Clinical and Translational Research, which is comprised of
five partner institutions across Mississippi. With that in mind, the purpose of the Tracking and Evaluation (T&E)
Core is to provide useful, credible and timely data on the MCCTR's implementation, effectiveness and impact so
that Core Leads and PIs can adapt ongoing programming in pursuit of program aims. During Phase I, the T&E
Core established a suite of systematic procedures for collecting and sharing data on program use, quality, and
effectiveness. These procedures were designed to allow Core Leaders to engage in data-informed decision
making. During Phase II, the T&E Core will deepen and extend this model to better enable robust, timely
assessments of program implementation–along with assessments of the MCCTR's wider impact—to support
continuous, data-driven improvement. The long-term goals of the MCCTR are to (1) increase institutional
capacity to conduct clinical and translational (C/T) research, (2) achieve growth in partner institutions' sustained,
extramural funding, and (3) improve patient care and public health in Mississippi. To evaluate the MCCTR's
progress toward these goals, the T&E Core will conduct a mixed methods evaluation consisting of four core
components: (1) a five-year panel study with faculty from across MCCTR institutions, (2) secondary data analysis
of institutional data, (3) landscape analyses to track changes in institutional infrastructure throughout the life of
the project, and (4) a synthesis of cross-core data to evaluate societal impacts. The T&E Core will also monitor
progress toward short-term goals. Evaluation tools will focus specifically on (1) growth in research capacity, (2)
community participation and engagement, and (3) increased research productivity, quality, and impact. These
data and analyses will be shared with the MCCTR Director, Steering Committee, and advisory committees to
inform their decision making, and allow them to realign MCCTR assets and efforts as needed to increase the
utilization and quality of MCCTR services and resources. This information will also be shared with NIGMS,
through the MCCTR's Annual Report. The efforts of the T&E Core will result in accountable, informed leadership
and guide the allocation of available assets to maximize the MCCTR's success in increasing the number and
diversity of C/T and community-based researchers in Mississippi, increasing multi-institutional collaboration and
overall research funding, and producing research that will reduce health disparities and improve health outcomes
across Mississippi."
10927416,"PROJECT SUMMARY-RESEARCH SERVICES CORE. The goal of the Mississippi Center for Clinical and
Translational Research (MCCTR) Research Services Core (RSC) is to train and assist investigators in research
development and implementation including regulatory management, responsible conduct of research, effective
recruitment and retention, and research compliance. The RSC will provide a broad range of clinical,
epidemiologic, and population health expertise to investigators from the MCCTR Clinical and Translational
Research Scholars (CTRS) Program and Pilot Projects Program (PPP) to facilitate growth in clinical and
translational (C/T) and population health research with an emphasis on: racial/ethnic health disparities, rural
health, and telehealth. To facilitate implementation of C/T research to improve the lives of Mississippians, the
RSC will develop a new Telehealth subcore to reach rural areas of the state, which have high rates of
cardiometabolic diseases and worse health outcomes. In collaboration with the Community Engagement and
Outreach (CEO) Core, the RSC will also leverage new state networks including the Mississippi State Department
of Health and Mississippi State Extension Services to expand the reach of these important clinical programs.
During MCCTR Phase II, the RSC will expand use of electronic health data by partner institutions through greater
use of the UMMC Research Data Warehouse and Patient Cohort Explorer, which will allow investigators to use
“real world” data to explore a variety of health indicators and outcomes. The RSC will also facilitate broader early
career investigator involvement in large epidemiologic studies including the Jackson Heart Study, the
Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study, and the Risk Underlying Rural Areas Longitudinal (RURAL)
Study through creation of a new Cohort Study Navigator position. The RSC will work closely with all of the cores
but early interactions with the Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Research Design (BERD) Core with each MCCTR
investigator will optimize chances of successful project design and completion. UMMC will serve as the “hub” for
clinical trials, and the RSC will expand use of the UMMC Clinical Research and Trials Unit through the RSC
Clinical Research Coordinators. The RSC will streamline the clinical trial process for MCCTR investigators and
assist with participant recruitment and retention of a diverse participant population by the partner institutions.
The RSC will also help expand collaborations between the MCCTR partner institutions as well as other
CTRs/CTSAs including the Mayo Clinic Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCaTS), the University of
Alabama Birmingham Center for Clinical and Translational Science (UAB CCTS), the Louisiana Clinical and
Translational Science (LACaTS), and the Northwestern University Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute
(NUCATS). These collaborative networks will provide unique opportunities for larger scale investigations of
health disparities, rural health, and telehealth."
10922792,"Administrative Core Project Summary
The overarching goal of the GP IDeA-CTR Administrative Core (AC) is to provide oversight for and
effectively coordinate all research and investigator development activities supported by the Cores. The
AC plan builds on successes in the first funding period. With a Steering Committee (SC) and an Internal
Advisory Committee (IAC) comprising representatives from all partner sites, and an External Advisory
Committee (EAC) of national CTR leaders, we developed effective infrastructure, services, resources, and
community relationships to advance CTR across the Great Plains region. To build a robust network, we
collaborate with research leaders at all partner sites to assess communication, disseminate information on the
GP IDeA-CTR, and establish pathways for building infrastructure at partner sites. Interactions and leadership
at the national level facilitated our ability to expand CTR regionally and at other IDeA sites. These foundational
activities and the approaches proposed in this renewal endeavor to transform the culture at partner institutions
to bolster CTR capabilities, translate laboratory research to measurable health outcomes, and bring community
and clinician-generated ideas and experience back to the lab. Our specific aims are to: 1. Maintain strong
leadership and governance. The PI, core directors, and institutional leadership will have the authority and
credibility to effectively manage personnel, facilities, budget, and resources, in line with institutional and NIH
policies. 2. Enhance the operations and contributions of our effective SC and advisory committees. SC
enhancements will further enable strategic and operational plans, improve access to Core facilities and
services, and maximize GP IDeA-CTR impact across the network. We will maintain our effective IAC and EAC
to advise on strategic plans and add an Academic Public-Private Board to advise on innovative methods to
catalyze CTR and drive findings to the marketplace. 3. Advance overall plans for managing, coordinating,
and supervising the entire range of IDeA-CTR activities to ensure scientific and fiscal flexibility. This
includes development, support, and oversight of administrative staff of the GP IDeA-CTR to promote effective,
timely communications among the lead institution (UNMC) and partners, Core Directors, investigators, and
NIGMS staff. By meeting these aims, the AC 1) Enhances SC capacity to govern programs; 2) Strengthens
communication and dissemination of information on GP IDeA-CTR programs, resources, and services; 3)
Supports a transparent environment that welcomes input from all partners to solve problems, revise goals, and
realign resources; 4) Links resources and individuals to catalyze team science across partners; 5) Oversees
clinical research resources; 6) Advances network-wide plans to reach individuals and providers in rural areas,
as in our Practice-Based Research Network; and 7) Improves GP IDeA-CTR programs, structures, and
governance through regular feedback from a rigorous Training & Evaluation Core, along with consistent IAC,
EAC, and strong Community Advisory Board inputs."
10922795,"Professional Development Core Project Summary
Professional development is a critical component of efforts to enhance biomedical research activities across
the Great Plains IDeA Clinical and Translational Research (GP IDeA-CTR) Network. The Professional
Development Core (PDC) will act as the hub of all professional development activities in the GP IDeA-CTR,
leveraging the diverse strengths of faculty across partner sites. As the hub, all professional development
activities will be routed through this Core, with other Cores and collaborators acting as spokes that will offer
specialized training activities facilitated by the PDC. Educational offerings will continue to address the CTR
core competency areas of scientific communication, team science, translational teamwork, leadership, and
cross-disciplinary training to enhance the competitiveness of our investigators. Team-based mentoring will be
an area of emphasis for the PDC with the goal of supporting the GP IDeA-CTR’s efforts to recruit and
effectively train scientists to work in teams to develop innovative, state-of-the-art clinical and translational
science. We will continue to develop our network of CTR mentors across institutions where we have provided
structured mentor training and hands-on opportunities to receive/provide mentoring and have developed a tool
prototype that will connect aspiring CTR trainees to suitable mentors. The PDC specific aims are to 1)
Facilitate effective professional development activities and educational CTR offerings across the GP IDeA-CTR
Network to those engaged in CTR to enhance research competency, productivity, and impact; 2) Provide
structured mentoring and mentor training for CTR researchers at all career stages with a focus on our
innovative team-based mentorship model; and 3) Expand formal programs to support the development and
retention of early-career faculty who are preparing to compete for external funding as CTR investigators. The
training resources and infrastructure provided by the PDC are unique to Nebraska and the surrounding Great
Plains region and will provide the needed support for CTR capacity across our region."
10922799,"Biostatistics, Epidemiology, & Research Design Core Project Summary
The objective of the Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Research Design (BERD) Core of the Great Plains IDeA-
CTR (GP IDeA-CTR) is to develop the infrastructure to conduct high-quality clinical and translational research
(CTR) and enhance the development of competitive CTR programs and research teams across Great
Plains. During the initial funding period, the BERD Core successfully leveraged its members' expertise to
provide essential support to advance CTR research across the GP IDeA-CTR network. The BERD Core
closely collaborates with the other Cores in team science approaches to continue and expand the support to
advance CTR further and address regional health priorities of the Great Plains region. In addition to supporting
scientific research and developing BERD methodology research, we collaborate with all the Cores and the Pilot
Projects Program to support training in study design, grant development, and mentoring of early career CTR
investigators. The BERD specific aims are 1) Consult and collaborate on study design, data acquisition, and
data analysis to support investigators and teams throughout the GP IDeA-CTR network; 2) Lead or facilitate
the development of cutting-edge methodologies and tools in response to the needs of the GP IDeA-

in transforming CTR in the Great Plains region by creating universal access to critical expertise, tools, and
resources. This access will benefit GP IDeA-CTR investigators to conduct successful CTR and equip GP IDeA-
CTR early career investigators with essential skills to develop their CTR careers."
10911135,"ABSTRACT
Tumor suppressor p53 is the quintessential guardian of the genome whose function is inhibited in greater than
50% of all human cancers. Though mutation and deletion of p53 are major contributors to p53 inactivation,
overexpression of the negative regulators MDM2 and MDM4 (MDMX) are also known to inactivate p53, thus
leading to the cancer phenotype. Our lab has shown that specific types of cell stress initiate the generation of
an alternatively spliced isoform of MDM2. The predominant MDM2 alternative isoform, MDM2-ALT1 also
known as MDM2-B, functions to primarily activate the p53 pathway by inhibiting MDM2 and MDM4 in a
dominant negative fashion. Paradoxically, this isoform is upregulated in several human cancers, such as
pediatric high-grade gliomas, astrocytomas, rhabdomyosarcomas (RMS), and liposarcomas, as well as adult
cancers such as lymphomas and those of the breast. Thus, MDM2-ALT1 plays opposing roles in cancer
progression dependent upon the context of its expression. In the proposed research, we will study the
underpinnings of the control of the p53 pathway by MDM2-ALT1 to better understand 1) the specific
mechanism by which that MDM2-ALT1 is generated in cancer and 2) the ability of the resultant isoforms to be
targeted using splice-switching oligonucleotides. We hypothesize that the expression of oncogenic MDM2-
ALT1 is modulated by alterations in protein and RNA nuclear factors during the progression to tumorigenesis
and can be targeted to induce splicing changes. We will use assays that identify and measure splice regulation
in conjunction with gene editing approaches to identify RNA sequences and their respective nuclear factor-
binding partners necessary for regulation of MDM2 splicing. Furthermore, we will use novel genetically
engineered mouse models as well as established mouse xenograft assays and novel splice switching
oligonucleotides (SSOs) to modulate MDM2 isoform levels. Our work will broaden our knowledge of
combinatorial regulation of RNA processing in response to stress and in cancer and interrogate the utility of
MDM2 isoforms modulation for rational control of the p53 pathway."
10911140,"Project Summary
Up to 95% of premature infants undergo red blood cell (RBC) transfusion while in the intensive care unit, yet it
is unknown whether more restrictive or more liberal transfusions will lead to optimal brain development. The
Transfusion of Prematures (TOP) Trial is a multi-center study funded by the NHLBI and supported by the
NICHD Neonatal Research Network (NRN). The primary objective of the TOP Trial is to assess survival and
rates of neurodevelopmental impairment at 22-26 months corrected age in extremely low birth weight (ELBW)
infants that are randomized to either liberal or restrictive RBC transfusion thresholds. The trial began
enrollment in December 2012 and reached the target sample size of 1,824 infants on time in April 2017.
Although major deficits in motor and cognitive function may be detected at 22-26 months of age, these infants
are too young to assess cognitive, behavioral, and coordination skills that, if impaired, can lead to problems
with academic skills, motor performance or adaptive functioning in home or school environments, conditions
that are far more prevalent in this population and create substantial morbidity for the children and their families.
Because optimal transfusion management is a critical knowledge gap in neonatology, the currently proposed
TOP 5 Study will assess functional neurodevelopmental outcomes of infants randomized to two different
transfusion thresholds in the TOP Trial at 5 years corrected age.
The TOP 5 Study Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC) is led by Co-PIs Dr. Peg Nopoulos, who has a ten-year
history of studying the outcomes of premature infants exposed to liberal or restrictive transfusion, and Dr. Sara
DeMauro, who has extensive experience conducting multicenter outcomes studies in collaboration with the
NICHD NRN and the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) at RTI International. The DCC PI Dr. Abhik Das also
leads the DCC for the NICHD NRN. The NRN has a superb track record in school-age outcomes research and
history of productive collaboration with NHLBI. Thus, the TOP 5 Study has been thoughtfully designed to
leverage existing successful research infrastructure, relationships, and resources in order to reduce
redundancy and ensure success. The results of the TOP 5 study will provide evidence about which
approach to neonatal transfusion (liberal or restrictive) minimizes damage to vulnerable neuronal
circuits and, in turn, which transfusion strategy will improve both short and long-term outcomes for
these vulnerable premature infants."
11097643,"Project Summary/Abstract
 The fact that both duplication and deletion of the Peripheral Myelin Protein 22 (PMP22) gene cause
dysmyelinating peripheral neuropathy illustrates the importance of PMP22 for peripheral myelin integrity.
PMP22 duplication causes Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Type 1A (CMT1A) and PMP22 deletion causes
Hereditary Neuropathy with Liability to Pressure Palsies (HNPP). Although CMT1A and HNPP are the most
common inherited peripheral neuropathies, research on them is underfunded and there are currently no
disease-modifying treatments. This is largely due to the fact that PMP22 function and the consequence of
altered PMP22 expression remain unclear. Thus, there is a critical need to expand knowledge of what PMP22
does in myelin, how it is regulated and when precise expression is required as a means to improve therapeutic
potential of CMT1A and HNPP. This proposal aims to utilize cutting-edge techniques, including conditional
mouse models and super resolution microscopy, and knowledge of cell adhesion and membrane biophysics to
advance understanding of CMT1A and HNPP pathomechanisms. My central hypothesis is that PMP22 gene
dosage and lipid raft association govern localization and organization of myelin adherens and tight
junctions; a function that is most critical during development. In Aim 1, I will determine how PMP22
regulates adhesion junction organization in peripheral nerve myelin during development and aging with super
resolution and electron microscopy. I will aid the interpretation of these studies by evaluating the effects of
altered PMP22 expression on prototypical adherens and tight junctions in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK)
epithelial cells. The temporal requirement for precise PMP22 expression in myelin will also be defined by
generating powerful conditional mouse models of CMT1A and HNPP. In Aim 2, I will determine how
palmitoylation impacts PMP22 lipid raft association and regulation of adhesion junctions and define the
biophysical properties of PMP22 within the plasma membrane using MDCK and Schwann cell models of
CMT1A and HNPP and advanced biophysical methods. This K22 Career Transition Award will provide me with
additional training, mentorship and expertise in cell adhesion, membrane biophysics and microscopy, thereby
enabling my proposed research and facilitating my transition to independence. This training will complement
my previous training in cell and molecular neurobiology and my current peripheral nerve training, and the
expertise acquired during Phase I will be applied to more complex models in Phase II to expand mechanistic
details. Completion of these aims will accelerate progress towards my long-term goal of developing an
independent academic research career studying pathomechanisms of CMT1A and HNPP as a means to
improve their therapeutic potential. The training and mentorship provided by this award will expand my
technical skills and expertise, positioning me for success as an independent investigator."
10909040,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overarching goals of this proposal are to define how intrinsic IL-2 production and extrinsic IL-2 signals act
in conjunction with helper CD4 T cell subsets to configure the exhausted CD8 T cell pool during chronic viral
infections and ascertain how these factors contribute to the restoration of responses following checkpoint
blockade therapies. This is significant for providing both fundamental insights into the regulation of exhausted
T cell ontogeny as well as for devising strategies to structure this ensemble to improve infection control while
avoiding immunopathology. The premise is founded in part on a series of exciting published and preliminary
findings showing that the pace of viral control can be predicted by the number of IL-2 producing CD8 T cells
present at the peak of the effector phase of the anti-viral response. Moreover, the initial formation of IL-2
producing CD8 T cells is accelerated during the earliest stages of chronic viral infections, but this population fails
to amplify, suggesting that they may instead serve as progenitors for the development of transitional and
terminally exhausted subsets. We also discovered that IL-2-producing effector CD8 T cells generated during
acute infections have superior protective powers and are resistant to full terminal exhaustion following adoptive
transfer and chronic viral challenge. Additionally, our preliminary findings demonstrate that the cell-autonomous
synthesis of IL-2 attenuates the ability to receive STAT5 signals. Collectively, these findings are consistent with
a model in which the initial manufacture of IL-2 enables exhausted precursor formation by restricting STAT5-
mediated signals, which are known to drive terminal differentiation. Further, we anticipate that the subsequent
extinguishment of IL-2 synthesis restores permissiveness to STAT5 signaling, which prompts the further
developmental transition of these precursors into more exhausted sub-populations. Our studies are designed to
pin-point how intrinsic cytokine production and extrinsic cytokine signals direct the formation and maintenance
of exhausted subsets, and provide new insights into the mechanisms that shape the efficacy of the anti-viral T
cell pool during chronic infections. We propose the following specific aims:
1. Define the contributions of IL-2-producing CD8 T cells to the formation of exhausted subsets.
2. Define the influence of functionally distinct CD4 helper subsets on the exhausted pool.
3. Determine the temporally distinct roles of IL-2 in structuring the exhausted pool.
Our studies take advantage of innovative and technically robust approaches to deconvolute the roles of distinct
cytokine producing subsets of anti-viral T cells during chronic infections. They are designed to impact the field
by advancing our understanding of how intrinsic cytokine production and extrinsic cytokine and cellular signals
integrate to configure the exhausted CD8 T cell pool and contribute to the control of chronic viral infections."

Department of Anesthesiology at Duke University Medical Center has intensively invested its
resources in the development of multidisciplinary laboratory and clinical research environments
to offer state-of-the-art research training experiences. We have also innovated in
anesthesiology residency training to provide a research continuum that provides a highly
effective preparatory phase prior to T32 enrollment. This proposal outlines the credentials of a
distinguished training faculty who are willing and prepared to meet our goal. The training
program involves a 2-3 year continuum when the trainees work under the close and direct
supervision of a program faculty member on research projects of mutual interest. Emphasis is
placed on learning responsible research skills, achieving mastery of the literature, independent
hypothesis generation, experimental design, data analysis, presentation and publication of
research findings and competition for extramural funding. All trainees are encouraged to exploit
relationships established with members of the program faculty for both enrichment of research
skill repertoires and development of long-term collaborative relationships. The program is
directed by the Program Director and an Oversight Committee consisting of 8 senior scientists
and the departmental chair. Trainees formally report to the program leadership at quarterly
intervals to allow assessment of trainee performance and progress in achieving program goals.
Trainees are sought from a national pool of eligible candidates with emphasis placed on
recruitment of under-represented minority trainees. The primary focus of this program is the
research training of select post-doctoral fellows. However, the program also is the cornerstone
of our departmental research training endeavor setting high standards for investigative training
offered to medical students, residents, junior faculty, and visiting scholars who participate in the

10817026,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Non-healing wounds in patients with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality and
are increasing at an alarming rate. Failure of wound healing in T2D patients represents the most common cause
of amputation in the US with a 5-year mortality rate of nearly 50%. Thus, a critical need exists for understanding
the wound healing defects in T2D in order to develop targeted therapies. We will utilize both genetic (db/db) and
dietary (diet-induced obese) murine models of T2D as well as human wound tissue and blood samples collected
from T2D patients to explore mechanisms of impaired wound healing. We present data using human single cell
RNA sequencing and murine diabetic wound models, that the repressive histone methyltransferase, SETDB2,
is decreased in diabetic wound keratinocytes resulting in increased production of inflammatory genes, namely
TNFα. Further, we have identified that interferon-beta (IFNꞵ), via a janus kinase (JAK1) / signal transducer and
activator of transcription (STAT) mechanism induces SETDB2 in wound keratinocytes. Our preliminary data also
identified that IL-17A is increased in diabetic wounds and may, in addition to reduced levels of IFNꞵ in diabetic
wounds, suppress SETDB2 in diabetic wound keratinocytes. These results have led to our hypothesis that
induction of SETDB2 in wound keratinocytes represses expression of NFkB-mediated genes (i.e., TNFα) that
maintain wound inflammation and directly impair keratinocyte migration, thereby promoting tissue repair. We
postulate that in diabetic wounds, it is the failure to induce SETDB2 and repress NFκB-mediated inflammatory
(Tnfα) genes in keratinocytes that prevents resolution of inflammation and impairs keratinocyte migration and
results in poor wound healing. We will test our hypotheses through three specific aims: Aim 1: To define the in
vivo regulation of NFκB-mediated gene expression by SETDB2 in normal and diabetic wound keratinocytes. Aim
2: To determine the JAK/STAT-mediated mechanism(s) that regulate keratinocyte-specific SETDB2 expression
in normal and diabetic wound tissue. Aim 3: To examine the therapeutic efficacy and timing of SETDB2-regulated
TNFα inhibition on keratinocyte migration and inflammatory wound Mφ phenotype. In this translational approach,
our data will pave the way for the development of promising therapeutic agents aimed at the targeting of
epigenetic pathways that mediate diabetic wound keratinocyte function and thereby promote diabetic wound
repair."
10892040,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Addictive drug use is highly prevalent among college-aged young adults and is linked to the development of substance use
disorders and other negative health outcomes later in life. Thus, understanding factors driving use is a critical public health
concern. While prior work has linked use to psycho-social factors, increased reliance on technological devices (e.g., mobile
phones, computers, gaming consoles), has introduced new risk-factors that cannot be ignored. As digital media delivers a
consistent stream of rewarding stimuli, heavy use has the potential to dysregulate neurobiological, reward processing
systems implicated in drug use, and result in withdrawal symptoms when prevented. Digital withdrawal symptoms may
intensify digital media craving, and craving for other rewards (e.g., drugs), in turn, leading to an increased risk for addictive
digital media and drug use. Identifying symptoms of maladaptive technology use that may predispose young adults to
escalating drug use is critical. The main objective of the proposed project is to characterize individual differences in
neurocognitive digital withdrawal symptoms and drug craving, following a period of digital media abstinence, and assess
associations with digital and drug use behaviors. Brain function, and withdrawal symptomology among drug using young
adults will be examined before and after a period of digital media abstinence in which participants will surrender their
mobile phone over-night and agree to not engage in any screen-time. Specifically, alterations in reinforcement processing
brain function and responsivity to drug and technology cues, following acute digital abstinence, will be characterized (Aim
1). Drug craving and digital withdrawal symptoms (physiological, affective, cognitive) linked to acute digital media
abstinence will be examined (Aim2). Finally, relations between individual differences in substance and digital media use
history, observed digital withdrawal symptoms, and altered brain function will be examined (Aim3). The proposed aims
will expand the PI’s existing experience in addiction neuroscience by allowing her to study comorbid risk for addictive
digital and substance use and gain new training in, peripheral physiology measurement, high-resolution neuroimaging, and
subcortical segmentation techniques."
10839314,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pediatric high grade gliomas (pHGGs) represent 10-15% of all brain tumors diagnosed in children. One subtype
of pHGGs, diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), is especially deadly, with a five-year survival rate of < 1%.
Current treatment options are non-curative; surgical resection, localized radiation, and chemotherapy are com-
plicated by the brainstem location of the tumor and accompanying negative side-effects. Thus, more effective
strategies are urgently needed. Approximately 70-80% of all DIPG tumors are marked by a dominant heterozy-
gous point mutation in H3F3A, which codes for the non-canonical histone H3.3. This toxic gain-of-function mu-
tation replaces lysine 27 with methionine (K27M), preventing trimethylation of lysine 27 (H3K27me3). H3K27M
has also been shown to interfere with Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), leading to global reduction of di-
and tri-methylation on histone proteins. This mutant H3.3 histone is predicted to be a major driver of tumorigen-
esis in H3K27M-mutated DIPG by disrupting normal neural differentiation. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs)
offer a unique method to target mRNA through Watson-Crick base pairing with high specificity and low toxicity.
In a recently submitted manuscript, my lab developed a “gapmer” ASO which targets H3F3A for RNaseH deg-
radation, inducing neural differentiation and prolonging survival. To further these results by pursuing a parallel
ASO modality, I will develop a splice-switching ASO that reduces translation of mutant H3K27M RNA by inducing
skipping of H3F3A exon 2, which contains the only in-frame start codon for H3F3A and the K27M mutation. This
splice-switching modality is significant because uniformly-modified ASOs, unlike “gapmer” ASOs, exhibit longer
half-lives and reduced off-target liability in the central nervous system, and ASOs of this chemistry are already
FDA-approved treatments. Furthermore, H3F3A and its paralogous gene H3F3B both encode identical H3.3
histone proteins, H3F3B is sufficient to compensate for loss of H3F3A, and H3F3B should remain unaffected by
my ASO strategy due to sequence dissimilarities. I hypothesize that the reduction of H3K27M will limit DIPG
tumor growth and prolong survival by promoting differentiation of the tumor cells. The aims of my pro-
posal are to identify a lead splice-switching ASO that reduces H3K27M and restores H3K27me3 and to charac-
terize the role of the RNA-binding protein RBFOX3 in reinforcing neural differentiation and H3F3A exon 2 skip-
ping following ASO injection. Methods to achieve will include establishing a preclinical in vivo mouse model with
H3.3K27M DIPG xenografts to study splicing changes of H3F3A and H3F3B through RT-PCR, protein expres-
sion of H3K27M and H3K27me3 through immunoblot, and neural cell differentiation through immunofluores-
cence following ASO injection. Additionally, splicing and analytical RNA-protein binding assays will be used to
characterize the role and binding kinetics of RBFOX3 with H3F3A RNA. The proposed research is significant
because it will: (i) help identify and provide mechanistic explanation for a new clinical candidate for drug devel-
opment; and (ii) provide further justification for use of ASOs in the treatment of neuro-oncological disorders."
10849662,"PROJECT SUMMARY
BCL-2 family proteins are critical regulators of apoptosis and deregulation of their protein interaction network
drives oncogenesis and chemoresistance. BAX is a pro-apoptotic BCL-2 protein that serves as a cardinal
executioner of the death pathway. During homeostasis, BAX resides as a latent monomer in the cytosol until
triggered by cellular stress to undergo a major conformational change, leading to its translocation to the
mitochondria and self-assembly into oligomeric species that permeabilize the mitochondrial outer membrane.
Cancer cells usurp the survival arm of the pathway, overexpressing anti-apoptotic members such as BCL-2 and
MCL-1, which can trap activated monomers of BAX, prevent oligomeric assembly, and thereby preserve
mitochondrial integrity. A critical missing link in our understanding of BAX-mediated apoptosis during
homeostasis and cancer is the structure of oligomeric BAX, referred to as the “holy grail” of apoptosis research.
The Walensky laboratory has recently generated the first stable and homogeneous oligomeric species of full-
length BAX amenable to structure-function analyses. Having characterized this BAX oligomer, termed BAXo, by
small-angle X-ray scattering, negative stain electron microscopy (EM) of BAX-porated liposomes, and
comparative functional studies of wild-type and BAX mutants in liposomes, mitochondria, and cells, a critical next
step is to deploy BAXo to solve a definitive structure and interrogate its functional interfaces. I hypothesize that
by generating diverse nanobodies against BAXo, I will be able to obtain high-resolution structures of this elusive
“death channel” and generate fresh insight into the mechanism of BAX-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis.
Specifically, I aim to (1) develop and characterize nanobodies that bind to oligomeric BAX and (2) harness BAXo-
binding nanobodies to determine the structure of oligomeric BAX and the interfaces critical to membrane-
permeabilizing function. To accomplish my goals, I will pursue a multidisciplinary workflow that incorporates a
yeast display nanobody discovery platform, protein engineering, biochemical assays in model membranes and
mitochondria, hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, X-ray crystallography, cryo- EM microscopy,
and mechanistic analyses of apoptosis in cancer cells. Thus, by developing and deploying BAXo-binding
nanobodies in comprehensive structure-function studies with built-in alternative approaches, I aim to both
characterize the execution-phase of BAX-mediated apoptosis and uncover novel and potentially druggable
surfaces for therapeutic benefit in cancer. I am excited to be pursuing a rigorous graduate training program in
the laboratory of Dr. Loren Walensky at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, and look
forward to developing as an independent and innovative physician-scientist at the interface of biochemistry,
structural biology, cancer biology, and clinical oncology."
10824349,"Project Summary
Neurons throughout the auditory system are remarkably plastic, allowing auditory circuits to flexibly adapt to
changing task demands and context. Flexible auditory behavior is the result of a dynamic interaction between
several auditory regions including upstream and downstream areas. The auditory cortex (AC) is modulated by
many behavioral factors including expectation, enagagement, and reward supporting the view that it is a hub for
perception. However, AC does not operate in isolation receiving direct top-down inputs from frontal-motor cortex
(M2) and bottom-up inputs from auditory thalamus (MGB) forming a central auditory axis important for auditory
perception and behavior.
The canonical view of auditory circuits has exclusively focused on the role of classically responsive neurons.
Thus, non-classically responsive neurons with highly variable trial-to-trial firing patterns have typically been
excluded from analysis despite being widely reported for decades. Thus, the mechanisms by which non-classically responsive neurons contribute to auditory processing, perception, and behavior is unclear. The goal
of this proposal is to directly investigate how local circuits in AC comprised of diverse ensembles interact with
downstream and upstream auditory brain regions to flexibly gate auditory behavior. We will take an unbiased,
inclusive approach by considering the entire spectrum of classically to non-classically responsive neurons, to
auditory perception and learning. We will record spiking and synaptic responses from adult mouse AC (Aim1),
record simultaneously from AC and an auditory domain of frontal-motor cortex (M2; Aim 2), and record spiking
responses from auditory thalamus (vMGB; Aim 3) during learning and perform optogenetic experiments to reveal
synaptic mechanisms and network dynamics involved in perceptual learning. These experiments will provide
unique insight into the neural basis of flexible auditory behaviors, and help identity novel therapeutic targets for
improving hearing disorders."
10795064,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Infants who are hard-of-hearing (IHH) are at significantly increased risk for poor auditory development and
speech perception (e.g., perceiving cat versus hat), despite early hearing detection and intervention. For
infants with normal hearing (INH), the first year of life is a seminal period for refining speech perception abilities
shaped by exposure to language. During this early developmental period, perceptual skills become more
narrowly tuned to spectral and temporal features, or cues, that favor discrimination of behaviorally relevant
information. Thus, early perceptual skill development is driven by the dynamic interplay between language
experiences and the concurrent maturation of auditory sensory pathways. Because refinement of speech
discrimination abilities depends on an infant's exposure to speech sounds, IHH are susceptible to atypical
development during this period. What remains poorly understood is the impact of inconsistent auditory cue
access and poor speech perception among IHH. There is a critical need to map auditory development among
IHH and to understand the long-term impacts of auditory cue processing on speech perception abilities. Filling
this need will lay the foundation for developing clinical tools that will aid in personalization of intervention
strategies.
Our overall objectives in this application are to 1) map the emergence of speech perception among IHH
compared to a cohort of age-matched INH; 2) describe the effects of auditory speech cue access on speech
discrimination in noise, and 3) to assess the relationship between attunement of speech perception and
functional auditory skills. By comparing these groups at 3, 6, and 12 months of age, we can describe the extent
to which maturation and experience contribute to the emergence and attunement of speech perception
abilities. To document speech perception development, we will use scalp-recorded electroencephalography
(EEG) measured in response to native and non-native speech sounds. Our hypotheses are: 1) INH will
demonstrate attunement for vowel and consonant speech sounds, but IHH will not; 2) speech perception
abilities measured at 12 months of age will be positively correlated with discrimination abilities; and 3) auditory
development scores will be higher for infants who demonstrate attunement to English consonant sounds.
Results will inform our understanding of speech perception and auditory skill development among IHH. Our
long-term goal is to improve speech and language outcomes in children with hearing loss. This project is
relevant to NIDCD's mission of understanding the mechanisms of hearing loss which impact the emergence of
speech perception and functional auditory skill development."
10817682,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The 24-hour cycles of endogenous regulation of physiology, known as circadian rhythms, align organisms
to the inherent rotation of the earth. Circadian rhythms influence the regulation of many essential processes,
including sleep regulation. Sleep is regulated by circadian rhythms in combination with sleep homeostatic
mechanisms in the two-component sleep model. This proposal aims to further our understanding of sleep
regulation by investigating key gaps that remain in the molecular mechanism of circadian rhythms, so that we
may understand the underlying mechanisms of circadian-based sleep disorders. Filling these gaps will therefore
enable us to develop therapies for sleep disorders. Circadian rhythms are defined in part by a ~24-hour period
length, and their ability to maintain a consistent period across changes in ambient temperature (temperature
compensation – TC). Despite the fundamentality of these properties, questions remain regarding their underlying
mechanisms. We will investigate how the feedback loop powering the molecular clock completes a cycle
(determining period length) in Aim 1, and the role for kinases and specific phosphorylation events in the TC
mechanism in Aim 2. Current evidence suggests that both of these properties are ultimately regulated by
phosphorylation. We hypothesize that the mechanism underlying period determination is conserved from
Neurospora to mammals, and hence the feedback loop of the mammalian clock is closed by
hyperphosphorylation of negative elements, rather than degradation, matching what our lab found in Neurospora.
Aim 1 tests our hypothesis that phosphorylation status and not stability of the clock protein PER2 determines
period length in mammalian cells. We hypothesize that TC involves precise and dynamic phosphorylation of key
clock components by Casein Kinase I and II. Aim 2 uses a combination of phosphoproteomics and epistasis
experiments with novel Neurospora strains to establish an integrative TC model that we will then test in
mammalian cells in culture, again expecting mechanistic conservation. Overall, this project will shed light on
fundamental aspects of circadian rhythms yet to be elucidated, ultimately establishing new models for
both period determination and TC. Therefore, successful completion of this work will inform the understanding
of all circadian-based disorders, including disorders such as Familial Advanced Sleep Phase Syndrome
(FASPS). This fellowship will enable me to fill gaps in my training to become an independent academic scientist.
Training will include participation in international conferences, mass spectrometry and modeling courses,
meetings with my advisors, thesis committee, and collaborators, and training in teaching techniques, among
others. I will take advantage of the rigorous environment at Dartmouth through departmental seminars and be
supported in my technical training by our excellent core facilities. My immediate research environment will be
the Dunlap/Loros lab that has for decades been a center for studying the molecular basis of circadian rhythms."
10835052,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Patients with chronic pain on opioids frequently experience loneliness, which is associated with poorer
health outcomes and higher risks for opioid misuse and opioid use disorder. Given that almost half of opioids
are prescribed in primary care, a critical need exists for the development and testing of interventions to reduce
loneliness in primary care patients at risk for opioid misuse. The long-term goal of our study is to reduce opioid
misuse and opioid use disorder by addressing loneliness in primary care patients on chronic opioids.
Interventions addressing maladaptive social cognition through cognitive behavioral therapy and improving
social support through social navigation have been shown to be effective in reducing loneliness and improving
outcomes in other fields but have not been tested in patients at risk for substance use disorder.
 In our study, which responds to RFA-DA-23-010 (Enhancing Social Connectedness and Ameliorating
Loneliness to Prevent and Treat SUD and Support Recovery), we propose a pilot 3-arm randomized clinical
effectiveness trial that will adapt and test the feasibility of implementing two efficacious interventions: (1) a
psychological intervention using cognitive behavioral therapy to address maladaptive thought patterns around
social connection and (2) a social navigation intervention to connect participants with social opportunities and
develop supportive social networks. Our proposed study would take place in primary care practices from the
Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana and Idaho region Practice and Research Network, a practice-based
research network of over 100 practices. Our specific aims are: (1) to refine and adapt both the social
navigation and psychological loneliness interventions for primary care patients on chronic opioids by engaging
patients and clinicians in a series of stakeholder group meetings, (2) to assess the feasibility of implementing a
3-arm randomized clinical effectiveness trial with 102 patients using the RE-AIM framework, and (3) to
determine the distribution and variability in the mediating outcome (loneliness), the primary outcome (opioid
misuse) and secondary outcomes including opioid dose, functional status and patient-reported pain at three
time points -- baseline, post-intervention and 3 months post-intervention.
 Our study is innovative because we are testing evidence-based interventions for loneliness in patients
at high risk for opioid misuse where they are already receiving care and where most patients with chronic pain
receive their pain related care. We expect that, consistent with the purpose of the R34 mechanism, this project
will prepare us for larger scale pragmatic trial, where we can leverage embedded or remote behavioral health
professionals within a diverse set of primary care practices, that tests patient outcomes, clinic-level feasibility,
and sustainability. The project is expected to have a positive impact in reducing opioid misuse and potentially
development of substance use disorder, as well as improve health outcomes, functionality, and quality of life."

The overarching goal of ET is to develop and test new therapies for solid tumors and hematologic malignancies
based on innovative preclinical research. The emphasis is on bringing basic and preclinical discoveries from ET
members to early-stage clinical testing and also on providing platforms for investigators in other programs to
evaluate their findings in clinical settings. To achieve this mission, the program focuses on three specific aims:
Aim 1: Target detection and measurement—Investigate diagnostic advances, including molecular early
detection, liquid biopsy and imaging, to guide new treatment approaches and assessments of response; Aim 2:
Molecular targeting: Development and preclinical and clinical testing—Investigate new cancer therapies
based on novel molecular targets in in vitro and in vivo laboratory studies as well as early phase clinical trials;
and Aim 3: Treatment delivery: Novel delivery strategies—Investigate the development of new technologies
for therapy delivery, including molecular carriers, nanotechnology, and novel radiation therapy and radiation
protection approaches. To achieve these three aims, members of ET are supported by extensive expertise
available in other University of Maryland Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center
(UMGCCC) Programs to translate basic research findings to the clinic and by the availability of exceptional
shared services. The ET Program has 56 members, including 31 full members and 25 associate members, who

10902069,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a common and lethal hematologic malignancy. Treatments of MM have been rapidly
evolving. While these new treatments improve survival considerably, the median survival still ranges from 43-
83 months at diagnosis. Among all cancer sites, the management of MM is the most costly, which in part can
be attributable to guideline recommended multidrug regimens. Despite such significant health and economic
burdens and rapid changing landscape for MM treatments, MM is not one of the cancer sites in the Cancer
Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET). Therefore, MM lacks comparative modeling to set
goals and policy prioritization in MM prevention and control. Moreover, unlike breast cancer or colorectal
cancer, there exists no population-based screening for MM or risk managed strategies for those with
premalignant conditions (MGUS and smoldering MM). MM requires comparative modeling to evaluate
promising intervention strategies, particularly at premalignant stages. To prevent/control this devastating
disease, it is imperative to demonstrate the potentials of these interventions before implementation. Moreover,
marked racial disparities in MM (both incidence and survival) is long-established. Without any value-based
strategies for prevention and treatment, MM health disparities will continue to worsen. This Incubator Program
will include two modeling groups to conduct comparative modeling under the coordination of the coordinating
center. Our Program will evaluate novel strategies in preventing or treating MM with the goals of reducing the
burden of MM and mitigating MM disparities. We plan to comparatively build, calibrate, and validate evidence-
based MM modeling across the MM care continuum (Aim 1). Using the proposed comparatively modeling, we
will (1) assess the impacts of novel MM prevention strategies in high-risk patients diagnosed with MGUS (Aim
2); (2) evaluate the cost-effectiveness of novel treatment regimens as well as guideline-recommended
treatments in patients diagnosed with MM (Aim 3); and (3) assess whether, under what conditions, and in
which ways the goal of eliminating racial disparities can be achieved through the proposed novel intervention
strategies (Aim 4). The proposed MM Incubator Program is significant in its capability to 1) build evidence-
based comparative modeling for MM, a disease area that lacks of such modeling, relative to the areas of solid
tumors already with such modeling, to guide interventions and policies; 2) provide evidence-based evaluation
before implementation of any costly clinical trial; 3) explore novel interventions/treatments at various stages of
MM; and 4) examine the value of guideline-recommended therapies, providing evidence to inform changes in
guidelines and thus a shift in current clinical practice of MGUS and MM management. The proposed
intervention strategies for MGUS and MM patients are innovative, with the goals to prevent and control MM
and reduce MM disparities. Successful completion of this study will provide evidence in tangible metrics to urge
a paradigm shift from current MGUS/MM management. It is therefore a vital step to move the field forward."
10914177,"Program Summary Alaska Native (AN) youth suicide is a public health crisis across the 229 rural villages of Alaska. Alcohol and other substance use disorders also disproportionately impact AN people and are a leading cause of death among AN adults. In response, the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium (ANTHC) established a Behavioral Health Aide (BHA) Program in 2008. The goals of the BHA Program are to provide culturally relevant training and education for village-based counselors to promote behavioral health and wellness in AN individuals, families and communities. A BHA is an Indigenous community health worker with the requisite skills, relevant training and appropriate placement within their Tribe or health organization to provide chemical dependency assessment and counseling, health education, crisis management and advocacy services. BHAs help address individual and community behavioral health needs, including grief, trauma, depression, suicide and substance misuse. While the BHA training and service model shows promise for increasing access to quality behavioral health care, no research has examined its process or outcomes. The Indian Health Service (IHS) has embraced the BHA model for replication in Tribal health settings across the U.S., and BHA candidates are currently being employed and trained in multiple Tribal health systems across the U.S. utilizing the ANTHC curriculum and certification program. The objective for this application is to test the scope of BHA practice, and the feasibility and acceptability of the BHA program in addressing this practice scope. There is a critical need for place-based, culturally congruent behavioral health services in rural and remote AIAN settings to address current access to care challenges. This need has only intensified as the behavioral health disparities crises with the COVID-19 pandemic. Promising practices such as the BHA model in AK need to be accelerated along the translational science pathway to evidence-based reimbursable service model status for tribal health systems."

The overarching goal of the Proteomics Core (Core 3) is to provide state-of-the-art, mass spectrometry-based-
proteomics and phosphoproteomics data and analyses in support of Projects 1-3. Genetic alterations in human
cancer have been systematically mapped by genomics landscape studies in the past decade, however, the direct
consequences of these alterations on the functional proteome are poorly understood. Deep scale, mass
spectrometry (MS)-based proteomic data when integrated with genomic data (`proteogenomics') have been
shown to improve specificity for identifying cancer-relevant pathways triggered by somatic DNA variants or DNA
copy number alterations (CNAs) compared to genomic characterization alone, and help to narrow target
selection for potential therapeutic intervention. Proteomics alone, especially with deep, quantitative profiling of
posttranslational modifications (PTM) provides information on signaling related to disease pathophysiology that
are largely opaque to genomics.
Core 3 will apply micro-scaled mass spectrometry-based proteomics technologies we have developed that utilize
highly multiplexed stable-isotope mass tagging (TMT 16-plex) for precise relative quantification of the proteome
and phosphoproteome of very small amounts with very deep coverage for the study of transformation of chronic
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) to Richter's Syndrome (RS). The resulting proteomic data, including the critical
quantitative and site-specific modification information, will be integrated with personalized genomic data using
bioinformatics tools that have been integrated into the cloud-based pipeline PANOPLY. Multi-omics clustering
and analysis will be done to define the intrinsic structure of the integrated proteogenomes across baseline and
treated samples. We will extract proteogenomic features that drive the underlying cluster structure and will
perform pathway-level analysis to further characterize each cluster in CLL and RS samples. Copy number to
mRNA, protein, and phosphoprotein correlations will be done to determine cis- and trans-regulated genes.
Pathways and molecular mechanisms underlying treatment response in patient and mouse models will be
explored using single sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA), and PTM Signature Enrichment Analysis
(PTM-SEA) will be used to perform pathway analysis on phosphorylation data generated.
To enable more rapid and specific analyses of proteins and phosphopeptides targets of interest emerging from
the discovery experiments, the proteomics core will develop high sensitivity targeted MS assays, to be utilized
in Projects 1-3. Assays developed will use stable isotope-labeled standards for unambiguous identification and
quantification and applied to human biospecimens and preclinical samples in native and drug-perturbed states."
10926958,"ABSTRACT – Project 1
 An ongoing and pressing cancer prevention challenge in the US is low HPV vaccine coverage, due in part
to infrequent and low-quality provider recommendations. Our 1-hour Announcement Approach Training (AAT)
teaches providers to use presumptive announcements that presume the child will receive vaccines and to use
best practices for respectfully addressing parent concerns when they arise. The AAT increases HPV vaccine
initiation and is an NCI-designated Research-Tested Intervention Program. To increase the impact of the AAT,
we propose to leverage the whole primary care team, including registered nurses (RNs) and medical assistants
(MAs), by supporting the implementation of existing standing orders. Standing orders are widely available but
often underused. As part of the P01 Program Project, “Improving Provider Announcement Communication
Training (IMPACT),” Project 1 will focus on AAT enhanced with standing orders support to expand the whole
primary care team's involvement in HPV vaccine recommendations. We will do this work in healthcare systems
serving rural and nonrural areas. Aim 1 is to characterize the role of RNs and MAs and standing orders in
HPV vaccination. We will conduct formative interviews (n=20) and then a national primary care team survey
(n=2,500) with our P01's Data Core to better understand how to expand the role of RNs and MAs in
recommending HPV vaccine and to implement existing standing orders for HPV vaccine. Aim 2 is to evaluate
the impact of supporting the implementation of existing standing orders for the whole primary care
team on HPV vaccine communication and uptake in an RCT. The standing orders support will be a series
of activation meetings that use persuasion and skills building with system leaders, clinic leaders and clinic staff.
We will conduct a trial in 40 primary care clinics in Mississippi, Missouri, and Texas that have HPV vaccination
standing orders, serve patients from rural and nonrural areas, and are part of a healthcare system. Clinics will
be randomized to AAT or AAT enhanced with standing orders support. The primary trial outcome will be clinic-
verified HPV vaccine initiation among children ages 11-12. We hypothesize that AAT with standing orders
support increases HPV vaccine uptake by improving HPV vaccine communication. Aim 3 is to generate
guidance for healthcare systems to support implementation of HPV vaccine standing orders to leverage
the whole primary care team. We will gather and share intervention data (cost, impact, and implementation
data) with Project 4 to support cost-effectiveness analyses and development of their decision support tool. We
will examine intervention implementation determinants and outcomes with our P01's Intervention Core. Finally,
we will contribute modules to the AAT Intervention Package that provides guidance to healthcare systems for
improving HPV vaccination. Project 1 addresses the IMPACT Program Project theme by building capacity for
HPV vaccine communication interventions among primary care teams in healthcare systems."

 Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination is effective and recommended to protect against six types of
cancer, but HPV vaccine coverage remains low. Provider communication has a powerful influence on HPV
vaccine uptake. Our program team has demonstrated that Announcement Approach Training (AAT) effectively
improves provider communication and increases HPV vaccination uptake. A promising tool to expand the
impact of AAT is clinic-level financial incentives, which can motivate providers to apply what they learn in the
AAT workshop. Financial incentives are increasingly a central part of payment reform efforts focusing on better
aligning financial incentives in healthcare systems with quality of care. No studies have adequately established
whether financial incentives motivate providers to recommend HPV vaccination. As part of the proposed P01
Program Project, “Improving Provider Announcement Communication Training (IMPACT),” the goal of this
randomized clinical trial (RCT) is to test promising alternatives to motivate providers to improve HPV vaccine
communication. We propose to examine whether financial incentives tied to clinic-level improvement in HPV
vaccination rates can improve HPV vaccine communication and uptake. To achieve this goal, in Aim 1, we
will characterize providers’ perceptions of financial incentives tied to HPV vaccination and behavioral
nudges via a national primary care team survey. We will also refine a feedback report to track HPV
vaccination rates paired with improvement targets to providers and clinics. In Aim 2, we will conduct the
RCT, randomizing clinics to one of two arms: 1) AAT and 2) AAT plus financial incentive tied to clinic-level
improvement in HPV vaccination rates. In Aim 3, we will evaluate intervention implementation, including
cost per additional adolescent initiating HPV vaccine. This RCT is significant because it will demonstrate
whether and how financial incentives improve provider communication and increase vaccine uptake to achieve
HPV vaccination goals. The proposed research addresses the IMPACT Program Project theme of amplifying
the impact of a Research-Tested Intervention Program to improve HPV vaccine communication in healthcare
systems via financial incentives to motivate providers to make needed recommendations."
10926964,"ABSTRACT – Project 3
 Widespread HPV vaccination could prevent most HPV cancers, but uptake among US adolescents
remains far below national goals. To increase uptake, we developed Announcement Approach Training (AAT).
AAT is a 1-hour communication workshop in which our physician facilitators train primary care teams to
address the most critical barrier to HPV vaccination: infrequent and ineffective recommendations. AAT is
effective for increasing HPV vaccine uptake among adolescents and is certified as an NCI Research-Tested
Intervention Program. One of the most promising opportunities for scaling up AAT is to implement the
intervention in healthcare systems, where most US pediatricians and family physicians now work. However,
new approaches to delivering AAT will be needed to bring the intervention to scale effectively in these settings.
Thus, as part of the P01 Program Project, “Improving Provider Announcement Communication Training
(IMPACT),” Project 3 will enhance AAT to train systems' own clinical champions to deliver AAT, thereby
building capacity for HPV vaccine communication training. In Aim 1, we will identify opportunities to
engage clinical champions in delivering AAT within their own healthcare systems. Working with 6
partnering healthcare systems, we will interview 24 champions to understand: anticipated barriers and
facilitators to AAT delivery; opportunities to extend AAT activities to increase reach and sustainability; and
preferences for receiving training on how to deliver AAT. In Aim 2, we will compare the impact of Champion
AAT to Traditional AAT on HPV vaccine uptake and communication. Using Aim 1 findings, we will adapt
our existing intervention package to train champions to deliver AAT to clinics in their own systems. In a 2-arm
non-inferiority trial, we will randomize 40 clinics in our 6 systems to receive Champion AAT or Traditional AAT.
We will compare interventions on the primary outcome of HPV vaccine initiation, among adolescents ages 11-
12, at 12-month follow-up. We hypothesize that Champion AAT will be non-inferior to (i.e., as effective as)
Traditional AAT. We will also compare our interventions on intermediate outcomes, including changes in
workshop participants' communication, to identify mechanisms that may explain improvements in HPV vaccine
uptake. In Aim 3, we will generate guidance to help healthcare systems compare and implement
Champion AAT and Traditional AAT. We will compare our interventions on implementation measures to
understand whether Champion AAT offers advantages, such as higher reach to primary care professionals,
compared to Traditional AAT. Lastly, to integrate Project 3 with other IMPACT projects, we will share data to
support cost-effectiveness modeling in Project 4 and contribute the Champion AAT module to the P01-wide
AAT Intervention Package. In this way, we will prepare our highly scalable intervention for national
dissemination. Project 3 addresses the IMPACT Program Project theme by engaging clinical champions to
build capacity for HPV vaccine communication interventions among primary care teams in healthcare systems."

 Human papillomavirus (HPV) cancers are preventable through vaccination. Yet HPV vaccine coverage is
well below the national goal of 80%, especially in rural areas where HPV cancers are more common. HPV
vaccine communication interventions are a promising approach to address low uptake. As part of the P01
Program Project, “Improving Provider Announcement Communication Training (IMPACT),” Projects 1-3 will
test novel enhancements of the Announcement Approach Training (AAT) intervention in healthcare systems to
improve primary care team members' HPV vaccine communication. The overall objective of Project 4 is to
facilitate decision makers' selection and adoption of AAT and other effective HPV vaccination
interventions, by quantifying tradeoffs in their comparative cost and health impact in rural and nonrural areas.
Aim 1 is to identify differences in contextual factors in rural and nonrural clinical settings that may
influence the implementation and effectiveness of enhanced AAT interventions. Using a mixed-methods
approach, we will conduct semi-structured interviews in rural (n=20) and nonrural areas (n=20) among primary
care team members, quality improvement decision makers, and health administrators, as well as survey a
national sample of primary care team members (n=2,500) to examine contextual differences across rural and
nonrural clinical settings. Aim 2 is to evaluate the budget impact, cost-effectiveness, and population
outcomes of HPV vaccine communication and other evidence-based interventions in rural and nonrural
clinical settings, including the enhanced AAT interventions studied in Projects 1-3, to facilitate comparisons for
decision making. We will develop a national county-specific HPV microsimulation model that overlays
interventions onto populations reflecting patterns of baseline HPV vaccination, HPV transmission, and
progression to HPV cancers to project the anticipated budget impact, cost-effectiveness, and population
outcomes of HPV vaccine interventions in rural and nonrural clinical settings. Aim 3 is to aid stakeholder
implementation planning by developing a web-based interactive decision support tool illustrating the
value and implementation outcomes of HPV vaccine interventions in rural and nonrural clinical settings. We will
engage stakeholders to evaluate the usability of the decision support tool for decision making and add to the
AAT Intervention Package. Project 4 addresses the IMPACT Program Project theme of amplifying HPV
vaccine communication interventions' impact in healthcare systems. Our project findings will translate the
health impact and cost of interventions tested in Projects 1-3 in rural and nonrural areas into a dissemination
format well-suited to the needs of decision makers in healthcare systems to accelerate the adoption of
promising HPV vaccine communication interventions to prevent cancer in diverse geographic contexts."

 Insufficient knowledge of brain-based risk factors for problem cannabis use is a key barrier to identifying
individuals at risk for cannabis-related harm and designing targeted prevention and early intervention
approaches to promote positive development for persons at risk. The current proposal combines multiple, large-
scale, neuroimaging datasets with novel densely-sampled fMRI data to identify a neuromarker of problem
cannabis use and characterize its development prior to cannabis use onset, and in the context of current
cannabis use in adolescence. We will apply a whole-brain, machine-learning method – connectome-based
predictive modeling – to identify a neural network predictive of problem cannabis use in a large sample of college
students (Brain and Alcohol Research in College Students study; BARCS), and compare this network to
canonical neural networks previously implicated in risk for cannabis use: frontoparietal, salience, and default
mode networks. We will then examine the developmental trajectory of these cannabis risk networks in relation
to other known risk factors for addiction prior to cannabis use onset in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive
Development (ABCD) dataset, a nationally-representative sample of 11,875 children. We will examine whether
individuals at high-risk for substance use problems (family history of substance use and exposure to early
adversity) display a delay in the typical trajectory of network stabilization within cannabis risk networks. Finally,
we will collect densely-sampled fMRI data (4 scans in 6 months) from 20 adolescents (age 15-17) who regularly
use cannabis and 20 age- and sex-matched typically-developing adolescents. This study design will enable us
to examine cannabis effects on short-term neural network dynamics and evaluate whether cannabis using
adolescents are characterized by reduced stability of cannabis risk networks relative to their typically-developing
peers. By combining multiple existing large-scale neuroimaging datasets with original, longitudinal, densely-
sampled fMRI data, the proposed study design offers a unique opportunity to examine the interplay between
neural mechanisms of risk for problem use and cannabis exposure effects on the developing adolescent brain
and promises to yield important insights into the neural mechanisms of risk for problem cannabis use that can
foster novel prevention and intervention initiatives to mitigate cannabis-related harms for individuals at high risk.
 The current proposal also aims to provide Dr. Sarah Lichenstein with expert mentorship by Drs. Pearlson,
Casey, Yip, Scheinost and Stevens to build the skills necessary to develop into an independent clinical scientist
applying multimodal neuroimaging methods to study the pathophysiology of addiction. Dr. Lichenstein will pursue
specialized training in studying cannabis effects on brain and behavior, big data science, and the conduct of
research with adolescent participants. Furthermore, the collection of novel, densely-sampled, adolescent fMRI
data will also provide Dr. Lichenstein with a rich and unique pilot dataset to support the submission of a R01
application by the end of the award period and facilitate her transition to an independent investigator."

multilayers of cells, and three dimensional tube/duct structures. Proper formation and homeostasis of the
epithelium is critical for tissue and organ function; dysregulation of the epithelium is associated with epithelial
barrier loss (including sepsis), defective wound healing, and development and progression of cancer. Strong
cell-cell junctions are critical to the integrity of the epithelium, including cell cohesion, barrier function, and
ability to resist mechanical stress. Loss of junctions is associated with epithelial dysfunction including
inflammatory-induced increases in permeability and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Although
formation cell-cell adhesions have been shown to be critical regulators of cell proliferation, migration, and
tissue organization, very little is known how cell-cell junction forces contribute to these processes. In addition,
the nucleus, which is physically connected to the cytoskeleton by the LINC (Linker of Nucleoskeleton and
Cytoskeleton) complex also experiences mechanical force resulting from both actomyosin contractility and
externally applied forces across cell-cell contacts and cell-matrix adhesions. Nuclear forces have been shown
to regulate the cell cycle, nuclear pore complex, and chromatin. Recent work by my group has also shown that
the LINC complex is a critical structure for epithelial homeostasis. This proposal examines the role of force
across proteins in both cell-cell junctions and the nucleus as mediators of epithelial homeostasis. The major
research goals of this R35 MIRA renewal are to 1) examine how mechanical forces regulate epithelial
homeostasis and morphogenesis, 2) identify the role of the LINC complex in epithelial homeostasis and
mesenchymal stem cell differentiation, and 3) investigate how forces across nuclear lamins and nuclear pore
complexes regulate epithelial physiology. Proposed experiments include in vitro models of ductal/glandular
epithelium using FRET-based tension biosensors to directly measure forces across tight junctions, adherens
junctions, and desmosomes, as well as the LINC complex, nuclear pores, and the nuclear lamina. New and
existing technical approaches will be used to modulate these structures, with the objective of identifying both
the upstream regulators of force and the downstream processes regulated by force. Additionally, in vivo
mouse models will be used to assess the role of the LINC complex and desmosomes in 3D epithelial tissue
homeostasis. This comprehensive study of cell adhesion and nuclear forces will greatly advance the
understanding of how epithelial homeostasis is regulated, which is relevant to the processes of wound repair,
inflammation, and epithelial tissue development and organization, as well as epithelial diseases, including
cancer, fibrosis, and chronic inflammation. Furthermore, results from this study concerning the role of forces
on the nuclear lamina and nuclear pore complexes will be relevant to nearly all cell types and tissues."

The neuronal pathways that connect the ear to the brain are not well understood. For decades, work has
focused on understanding how damage to hair cells (the sensory receptors in the inner ear) impacts hearing.
We now know that the neuronal circuits that transmit auditory information detected by the hair cells are even
more vulnerable to damage. Further, this damage is permanent and has lasting impact on quality of life.
Deepening our understanding of how neuronal circuits are established and maintained in normal hearing will
be a critical to better understand disease and improve prevention and treatment strategies.
The perception of sound begins in the cochlea, where hair cells detect and transmit auditory input to the
brainstem via afferent neurons. Efferent neurons provide feedback control allowing tuning of this input. These
neurons are born early in development and following differentiation send projections to the cochlea sensory
epithelium where they make highly specific connections with two types of hair cell: the inner and outer hair
cells (IHCs and OHCs). How these projections track to the appropriate location within the cochlea (either along
the cochlear duct, or between inner and outer compartments) is not well understood.
The goal of this proposal is to obtain a comprehensive picture of how afferent and efferent innervation patterns
are set up in the organ of Corti. Using a recently described Insm1 mouse model, in which IHCs are
intermingled with OHCs in the outer compartment (oc-IHCs), I will test the hypothesis that there is a
hierarchical model of innervation such that hair cell type dictates afferent innervation which in turn determines
the type of efferent innervation received (aim 1). Additionally, using a combination of mouse genetics and
cochlear explant cultures combined with viral vectors, I will test novel candidate genes for roles in axonal
pathfinding and branching in the cochlea (aim 2 and alternative aim 2/future goals). I believe these aims will
materially advance our understanding of the neuronal circuits within the ear and ultimately lead to the
development new and improved treatments for hearing loss.
My long term career goal is to establish myself as an independent investigator at a top research institution.
Given I have recently moved research field (and model system) from transcriptional regulation to neurobiology,
this award would allow me to a) gain depth and breadth of knowledge, and technical expertise in the auditory
field b) publish my work in reputable journals and c) develop an independent project that can be used to obtain
my own independent funding and tenure track position. With the combination of this grant, the expert guidance
by my mentoring team and the expertise and resources available to me through the broader auditory
community established here at Northwestern University means that I will have every chance of success."

Age-dependent degenerative diseases, such as ALS, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease, are reaching
epidemic proportions and no viable treatment options exist to halt or reverse the course of the disease. The
lack of disease-modifying treatments is in large part due to our lack of knowledge about the molecular disease
pathology. An early hallmark of most degenerative diseases is an accumulation of protein aggregates and
damaged organelles, implying that proteostasis defects are an underlying molecular cause of degeneration.
Lysosomes are digestive organelles that clear damaged proteins and are also critical regulators of cellular
metabolism. Thus, it is not surprising that lysosome impairment is linked to a broad spectrum of degenerative
and metabolic diseases. Revealing novel ways to improve or maintain lysosome function in various biological
contexts could open promising therapeutic avenues to treat a wide range of metabolic and degenerative
diseases. We recently discovered a unique class of degradative tubular lysosomes (TLs) that are conserved in
flies, worms and mammals. Significantly, mutation of two genes required for TL maintenance are linked with
human degenerative diseases, underscoring the potential biomedical relevance of TLs. Our recent work has
demonstrated that TLs are exceptionally digestive, tissue specific and in some cases even stimulus dependent.
For example, TLs are stimulated in gut cells during starvation, a major cue that stimulates the autophagy-
lysosome system to increase nutrient recycling. We hypothesize that TLs might be deployed under certain
conditions when autophagic demand is high. This context dependency also suggests that TLs have the
capacity to be stimulated and opens the possibility that TLs could be induced in other tissues where they do
not exist naturally, such as neurons. Using worm and fly model systems, we aim to understand fundamental
aspects of TL biology in health animals and their connection to human degenerative diseases. Three major
research questions we are tackling in my lab include: (1) what are the control mechanisms for starvation-
induced TLs in the gut? (2) are TLs functionally distinct from vesicular lysosomes? and (3) is TL dysfunction an
underlying cause for age-dependent degenerative diseases? We anticipate that these studies will reveal novel
aspects of lysosome biology and might inform strategies to co-opt these mechanisms to boost lysosome
function in healthy animals or repair lysosomes in disease states."

 The long-term goal of this proposal is to study mechanism(s) of pathogenicity of Cryptococcus neoformans (Cn)
focusing on how Cn glycolipids regulate fungal virulence and the host immune response.
 Cn is a fungal pathogen that, upon entering the lung and disseminating through the bloodstream, causes a life-
threatening meningo-encephalitis in susceptible patients, leading to high morbidity and mortality. Current therapies for this
disease can have intolerable and dose-limiting side effects.1 Thus, new treatment strategies are warranted to better control
the high mortality associated with cryptococcosis.
 Although vaccines have been hailed as one of the greatest achievements in public health during the past century, the
development of safe and efficacious vaccines against cryptococcosis, and fungal infections in general, has been a major
hurdle mainly due to the lack of knowledge about the mechanisms that underpin protective immunity. Additionally, fungal
vaccines need to be effective also in conditions of immunodeficiency, such as CD4+ T cell lymphopenia in AIDS patients,
because immunodeficient patients are the most susceptible to cryptococcosis and other invasive fungal infections.
 In previous studies, we deleted the sterol-glucosidase 1 (Sgl1) gene and the resulting mutant (Dsgl1) is highly enriched
in sterol glucosides (SGs), which are otherwise not detectable in wild-type (WT) Cn cells.2 SGs are glycolipids present in a
variety of fungi and other microorganisms and are prone to stimulate host immunity.3-5 During the previous funding cycle,
we showed that Cn Dsgl1 mutant is not pathogenic in a mouse model and, upon intranasal administration, the mutant cells
are rapidly eliminated in the lung environment.2 Very interestingly, mice receiving Cn Dsgl1 mutant are now protected when
challenged with virulent Cn WT and this protection is achieved even when mice are CD4+ or CD8+ T cell depleted,
mimicking the HIV+ host (Fig.12 and2). We validated the role of Sgl1 in second fungal pathogen, Aspergillus fumigatus
(Af). The Af DsglA is also not virulent (Fig. 9) and able to protect against a secondary Af WT infection (Fig. 11). Importantly,
we initiated a high throughput screening and found small molecules that inhibit Sgl1 or SglA activity in vitro, accumulates
SGs in fungal cells (Fig. 6), exert in vitro antifungal activity against Cn and Af in minimum media with low glucose
concentrations (Figs. 2 and 3), and block the dissemination of Cn to the brain (Fig. 5), mimicking the phenotypes observed
with the respective Dsgl1 or DsglA mutants.
 In addition, a key characteristic of Cn is its polysaccharide capsule, mainly made of glucuronic acid, xylose and
mannose (GXM). Very interestingly, we found that deletion of GXM totally abrogates the protective phenotype of Cn Dsgl1.6
In fact, the administration of the Cn Dcap59/Dsgl1 double mutant does not protect against a secondary infection (Fig. 8).
 Based on these observations, we hypothesize that Cn Sgl1 is a major regulator of fungal virulence by modulating
the level of SGs, which, through GXM, stimulate the host immune response against cryptococcosis (Fig. 1). To
test this hypothesis, we propose the following aims:
 Aim 1. To determine the role of Cn Sgl1 and Af SglA on fungal virulence.
 Aim 2. To study the host immune response against Cn accumulating SGs.
This proposal will provide novel insights on the role and mechanisms by which fungal SGs regulate the pathobiology in Cn.
Importantly, these studies will also potentially lead to the development of novel antifungal strategies to prevent and/or treat
invasive fungal infections, such as cryptococcosis and aspergillosis, in immunocompromised hosts."

Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is a major health problem and can lead to liver failure, liver cancer, and
death, incurring enormous healthcare expenditures annually in the US. Few specific treatments are available for
patients with ALD. Abstinence is difficult to achieve in many patients and cannot prevent the progression at later
stages of ALD. Deciphering molecular mechanisms and identifying novel markers of ALD can lead to new
therapeutic avenues and is of substantial interest to public health and welfare. Mitochondria, the central location
for alcohol-metabolizing enzymes, are active mediators in response to alcohol toxicity. Mitochondrial alterations
induced by alcohol are a hallmark of ALD, which have profound impacts on cell metabolism and associate with
activation of inflammation, underlying the pathogenesis of ALD. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4)
inactivates pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) in the mitochondrial matrix, thus suppressing the conversion
of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. PDK4 maintains mitochondrial homeostasis and has been implicated in the
development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and apoptotic liver injury. However, little is known about the role
of PDK4 in ALD. This proposal is to reveal how PDK4 coordinates mitochondrial dysfunction with activation of
inflammation in the face of ethanol-induced liver injury. Our central hypothesis is that loss of PDK4 function
impairs alcohol metabolism/detoxification and enhances pro-inflammatory response to promote the development
of ALD. We aim to: (1) define the role PDK4 in liver injury in mouse models of ethanol feeding; (2) unravel the
molecular mechanisms of PDK4 in ethanol-induced liver injury. Our proposed studies will conceptually and
mechanistically reveal the connection between mitochondrial ethanol metabolism and inflammasome activation,
which helps to open novel therapeutic avenues for the treatment of ALD. This K01 application will allow the
applicant to acquire advanced knowledge and research skills in ALD by integrating interdisciplinary resources.
The applicant has assembled an advisory committee composed of outstanding members, including Drs. Laura
Nagy (mentor), Srinivasan Dasarathy, and Xiaoxia Li, who are renowned hepatologists or well-recognized
scientists in fields of alcohol metabolism, inflammation, mitochondrial biology, gene expression and regulation,
immunology, etc., with a formidable record of training junior scientists to be independent and successful in
academia. They will direct the applicant's academic career development and provide full support to the
implementation of proposed experiments."

Research: RNA binding proteins (RBPs) regulate diverse cellular processes including transcription,
translation, and regulation of gene expression, and are frequently dysregulated in cancers. Through an
unbiased genetic screen aimed at identifying cancer-specific RBP dependencies, we recently identified
a specific requirement for RBM39 in malignant myeloid cancers and that cancers bearing RNA splicing
factor mutations as being particularly sensitive to the anti-cancer sulfonamides. RBM39 is an RBP that
functions in RNA splicing and recently, a class of clinical-grade “anti-cancer sulfonamide” compounds
were demonstrated to degrade RBM39 protein by co-opting the Ddb1/CUL4 ubiquitin-ligase complex as
their mechanism of action. Thus, the primary goal of this project is to assess differential and
tissue-specific requirements for RBM39 in normal hematopoiesis versus myeloid malignancies,
and to assess requirements for RBM39 for leukemia initiation and maintenance. This proposal will
utilize a novel conditional knockout (cKO) mouse for Rbm39 and several associated newly developed in
vitro and in vivo murine models to pursue this goal. We expect these investigations to further our
understanding of the role of RBM39 in normal physiology and cancer as well as provide new
therapeutic insights into the on- and off-target toxicities of the anti-cancer sulfonamides. These goals
are particularly timely given that several of these molecules have already proven excellent safety in
multiple phase I/II trials and are now ripe for therapeutic testing in a patient population most likely to
benefit from RBM39 degradation. Candidate: Dr. Sydney X. Lu is a graduating hematology & medical
oncology fellow in the Department of Medicine at MSKCC. He aims to become an independent, tenure-
track physician-scientist investigating the molecular pathogenesis of hematological malignancies through
a combination of genetics, functional genomics, and murine modeling. Dr.Lu has outlined a five-year period
of mentored training to strengthen his skills in functional genomics and disease modeling. This training
period will be carried out under the mentorship of Dr. Omar Abdel-Wahab, a leader in the functional
genomics of hematopoietic malignancies. Dr. Lu has also assembled an advisory committee composed of
Drs. Ross Levine, Martin Tallman, Michael Kharas, and Christine Mayr who will help guide his training
and research. Environment: MSKCC is the world's oldest and largest private cancer center, devoting
more than 130 years to exceptional patient care, innovative research, and outstanding educational

The Arrestin superfamily of proteins controls the trafficking, turnover and signaling of trans-
membrane receptors, as well as other intracellular signaling functions. Several members of the
family, including ARRDC3 and TXNIP, are now known to have important roles in metabolism.
ARRDC4 is an understudied protein that has been shown to inhibit glucose uptake in vitro,
interact with ubiquitin ligases and plays a role in membrane receptor trafficking. The in vivo
functions and the molecular mechanisms of ARRDC4 are unknown. My preliminary experiments
reveal that mice with systemic deletion of ARRDC4 are glucagon resistant compared to wildtype
controls. Decreased hepatic gluconeogenesis and glucagon signaling and defects in hepatic
glucose production suppression were also observed in the liver tissues of ARRDC4KO mice. I
have now generated a new conditional deletion ARRDC4 mouse model for this project.
The glucagon receptor is a GPCR, and therefore a potential target to interact with arrestin family
proteins. As ARRDC4 interacts with membrane proteins and 7TM receptors, an important goal
of my research is to answer if ARRDC4 controls glucagon signaling by interacting with glucagon
receptors or its downstream mediators. The specific aims of this project will focus on unraveling
the functions of ARRDC4 in hepatic glucose metabolism in vivo and the mechanism of ARRDC4
regulation at the molecular level. Because ARRDC4 is itself regulated by glucose and insulin,
defining the metabolic functions of ARRDC4 has the potential to reveal a metabolic feedback
loop in glucose metabolism that interfaces with glucagon signaling."

It has long been observed that certain diseases may be diagnosed by smell alone. There is mounting evidence
supporting these observations, showing that the metabolic changes brought about by disease, expressed in
biospecimens such as sweat, breath, urine and blood, can be accurately identified through olfaction. This is the
case not only for metabolic diseases such as diabetes, but most notably cancer, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and
many types of infection, including COVID-19. But it remains a mystery how olfactory systems achieve this ability,
especially when faced with the stark levels of variance in healthy populations, and the challenge of identifying a
complex odor object against irrelevant background components. This project will investigate the neural
mechanisms of odor-based disease diagnostics in the olfactory system of the mouse.
Initial experiments will image the responses of olfactory sensory neurons in the olfactory bulb of the awake
mouse. Using mouse models of disease, we will collect urine samples corresponding to both disease and healthy
states, with controlled between-sample variability. We will image glomeruli, with each glomerulus aggregating
the axons of sensory neurons expressing the same class of receptor. Linear and nonlinear dimensionality
reduction methods will be developed to analyze the complex spatiotemporal patterns of glomerular activity
elicited by disease and healthy control samples. From this analysis, the key features of neural activity that
underpin disease detection will be identified, and related to specific glomeruli. Glomeruli of interest will then be
used to isolate the volatile organic compounds of relevance, through gas chromatography-olfactometry in parallel
with gas-chromatography/mass-spectrometry. Additionally, quantitative methods will be developed for the
alignment of neural spaces across multiple mice, using a minimal number of odors. This will render odor features
translatable across animals, allowing for the decoding of disease in mice without extensive training data
collection. The developed experimental and computational pipeline will be then applied to detect and decipher
odorprints of multiple human diseases.
Understanding how olfactory systems detect disease has the potential to revolutionize medical diagnostics,
particularly with respect to early and noninvasive screening. But it will also constitute progress in ‘cracking the
olfactory code’, with our understanding of olfaction currently lagging behind vision and audition. From an
evolutionary perspective, the natural stimuli of olfaction were the metabolic states of food, mates, peers, and
predators, rarely the monomolecular odorants commonly used in olfaction research today. While this project has
an applied aim of medical diagnostics, the path to that aim proceeds via a deep understanding of some of the
fundamental, yet still mysterious, principles of olfaction."

This K23 award will support the candidate’s growth toward an independent clinical research career focused on developing and testing psychosocially-oriented mind-body interventions to improve the quality-of-life and treatment outcomes of chronic pain and postsurgical pain populations. Lumbar spine pain affects over 50 million individuals in the United States (US). The rate of spine surgeries performed in the US is the highest in the world. Yet, up to 40% of patients experience poor pain-related, functional, or quality of life outcomes after surgery. Despite the limited efficacy and high risks associated with long term opioid use, up to 50% of patients are prescribed opioids for up to 12 months following lumbar spine surgery. Nonpharmacological approaches addressing psychosocial risk factors for poor post-surgical outcomes are understudied and underutilized during postsurgical recovery. The proposed project aims to 1) adapt and refine a mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) for one-on-one telehealth delivery (live videoconference) to patients recovering from lumbar spine surgery by conducting a preliminary test of the MBI and collecting patient feedback using mixed methods; 2) conduct a two-arm pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the postsurgical telehealth MBI vs. an education control to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the interventions and research procedures; and 3) summarize trajectories of pain-related outcomes (pain interference, opioid usage) and treatment targets (pain-related beliefs, mindfulness, psychophysical measures), within intervention groups and within key patient subgroups (levels of preoperative negative affect and opioid use status). The proposal targets career development in several areas: 1) developing and testing mind-body interventions utilizing mixed methods and longitudinal data collection and analysis; 2) randomized clinical trial design and methodology; 3) psychophysical testing of pain modulatory systems; 4) content knowledge in postoperative orthopaedic pain and opioid use; and 5) grant-writing skills. The candidate’s training goals will be achieved with the support of a multidisciplinary team of accomplished mentors and contributors, through targeted course work and seminars, culminating in completion of the proposed research project and dissemination of results. Training will take place in a resource-rich academic medical center with a top-performing surgical center and existing infrastructure for the prospective study of patients undergoing lumbar spine surgery. The findings will help tailor a telehealth MBI for an orthopaedic postsurgical population and provide preliminary data to optimize a well-powered RCT. This K23 award will promote the early career candidate in establishing an independent research program focused on optimizing telehealth mindfulness interventions in postsurgical and pain populations to inform the science and delivery of personalized pain management practices. The goals of this project are strongly aligned with NCCIH scientific priorities to address the widespread burden of chronic pain and the ongoing opioid epidemic."

Glaucomatous optic neuropathy (GON) remains the world’s leading cause of irreversible blindness. At present

with topical eye drop monotherapy is generally the initial treatment of choice for patients with GON. Of the
available medication classes, Prostaglandin F2 analogues (PGF2α) such as latanoprost are often used as first-

effects limit its use in other patients. Furthermore, some studies estimate that less than half of patients use
glaucoma eye drops as prescribed. Additionally, because of the pharmacokinetics and dosing regimens,
fluctuation in IOP is common which also contributes to GON. We recently identified a peptide hormone,
Stanniocalcin-1 (STC-1) that lowers IOP when applied topically and can be expressed in a sustained fashion
with a viral vector to provide sustained IOP reduction. STC-1 was identified in our laboratory’s search of
downstream effector molecules in latanoprost-mediated IOP reduction. To date, we have demonstrated that: 1)
STC-1 is required for the IOP-lowering effects of latanoprost; 2) Topical STC-1 lowers IOP as a stand-alone
drug and is equivalent to latanoprost for IOP reduction in normotensive mice; 3) IOP-lowering effects of STC-1
are independent of the FP receptor; 4) STC-1 lowers IOP in ocular hypertensive mice; 5) STC-1 lowers IOP in
the domestic cat; and 6) STC-1 delivered by adeno-associated virus (AAV-STC-1) lowers IOP in a sustained
fashion in normotensive mice. Our central hypothesis for this application is that expression of STC-1 with a
viral vector will provide an effective, safe, and sustained treatment for IOP reduction that has potential to
benefit the 80 million people worldwide afflicted by glaucoma. Aim 1 will confirm and optimize our
preliminary data that STC-1 can be delivered with a viral vector to provide sustained IOP reduction in
normotensive mice. The data will determine the optimal viral vector for IOP reduction and correlate with tissue
expression, define minimal therapeutic dose of virus, and evaluate safety using histologic methods. Aim 2 will
utilize the optimized viral construct and evaluate IOP reduction in models of ocular hypertension. A steroid-
induced ocular hypertension model as well as the DBA/2J model of pigment dispersion will be used. Additional
measures will include assessment of aqueous outflow parameters. Aim 3 will evaluate viral expression of STC-1
in domestic and primary congenital glaucoma cats as well as to evaluate aqueous humor outflow and safety.
Combined with strong preliminary data and an expert mentorship panel, these aims will support our long-
term goal of developing a novel, targeted, sustained delivery of an IOP-lowering agent for the estimated 80
million people worldwide with GON."

 Epilepsy is the most prevalent neurological diseases after migraines. Current antiepileptic drug treatments
mainly attempt to reduce excitation or enhance inhibition in order to control seizures. Unfortunately, such
therapeutics result in a number of undesirable side-effects, and demonstrate limited efficacy against drug-
resistant cases of epilepsy. So far, no treatment has been developed as an anti-epileptogenic agent, in part
because of the limited understanding of the processes involved in the development of epilepsy. It is generally
accepted that up to 50% of all epileptic patients become epileptic as a result of a triggering initial injury such as
status epilepticus, stroke or traumatic brain injury. This initial triggering injury has been postulated to activate a
cascade of events leading to further seizures, increased brain damage and self-propagation. Calpains are a
family of soluble calcium-dependent proteases, which have been implicated in epilepsy, since they are activated
by seizures and participate in neuronal damage. Recent studies have also indicated that during early
epileptogenesis, seizure occurrence, calpain activity and neuronal damage are correlated, and that treatment
with a non-selective calpain inhibitor reduces the development of spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) in the
pilocarpine model of epilepsy in rats. Our laboratory has demonstrated that calpain-1 and calpain-2, two of the
major calpain isoforms in the brain, have opposite functions in the brain. We have also found that calpain-2
conditional knock-out mice with calpain-2 deletion in excitatory neurons from the forebrain show normal seizure
activity following injections of repeated low doses of kainic acid (KA) but exhibit no brain inflammation,
degeneration and cognitive impairment in hippocampus-dependent learning 7 days after seizures. Similar
protective results were obtained when wild-type mice were treated daily and for seven days after seizures with
a selective calpain-2 inhibitor. These results strongly support the hypothesis that calpain-2 might represent a
potential therapeutic target to prevent various pathological consequences of seizures. This Phase I STTR is
directed at first determining whether a selective calpain-2 inhibitor, NA-184, might prevent the appearance of
SRSs or reduce their frequency in two mouse models of epilepsy, the repeated low doses of kainic acid (KA) or
of pilocarpine models (Aim #1). In Aim # 2, we will test the effects of intranasal administration of NA-184 on KA-
and pilocarpine-induced neuropathology, as intranasal delivery of a variety of anti-epileptic drugs is increasingly
used in the clinic. In Phase II of this STTR, we will further pursue the development of intranasal delivery of NA-
184 as an anti-epileptic treatment. NeurAegis is a small biotech company focusing on the development of
selective calpain-2 inhibitors for the treatment of acute neuronal injury, including traumatic brain injury and
repeated concussions. This proposal is directed at expanding the potential applications of these calpain-2
inhibitors by determining whether they could also be developed as potential therapeutic treatment for epilepsy."

Novel genomic technology, such as microarray analyses and next-generation sequencing, have improved the
understanding of prostate cancer biology and prognosis. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network
(NCCN), in 2016, recommended that patients and clinicians consider tissue-based genetic tests for localized
prostate cancer. However, while much enthusiasm currently exits for the rapidly increasing field of genomic
medicine, the use of multi-gene mRNA expression panels raises the potential for further divergence in prostate
cancer treatment outcomes by race and low socioeconomic status. We know that health disparities persist in
low income groups despite the existence of evidence-based guidelines and that adoption of state-of-the-art
methods often lag behind in these groups.
The goals of this NCI K01 application are to (1) explore how men with localized prostate cancer and their
caregivers comprehend prognostic genetic technology, and (2) examine how an educational video about
genetics impacts patient-caregiver communication of prognostic genetic technology. The study rationale is that
without direct attention to genomic comprehension, the enthusiasm that exists in the rapidly increasing field of
prostate cancer genomic medicine may not translate into health benefits for men with localized prostate
cancer. The central hypotheses are (1) men and caregivers with lower levels of education will demonstrate a
severe lack of genomic comprehension of tissue-based genetic tests for localized prostate cancer; and (2)
tailored prostate cancer education, communication coaching, and a genomic literacy educational video will
significantly improve patient-caregiver communication in a low literacy population.
The study approach is innovative because it applies a mixed-methods community-engagement research
framework to explore how African American and rural White men with localized prostate cancer,
comprehend and interpret data generated from genetic technology. The proposed research is significant
because of its potential to improve public health by (1) improving the understanding of prognostic genetics in
minority, low income, and rural populations, and (2) engage and educate these diverse communities about
genomics. The proposed research, in combination with a structured mentoring and training plan that includes
didactic course and workshops, is designed to facilitate Dr. Ewan Cobran’s long term goal of developing an
independently-funded research program in prostate cancer disparities, consistent with the mission of the
NCI."

The reactive oxygen species (ROS) including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) are key signaling molecules that
mediate diverse biological processes, including cell migration involved in tissue repair, immune response, and
cancers. The central molecular targets of ROS are protein cysteine residues that form various thiol oxoforms,
including S-glutathionylated cysteines, termed as S-glutathionylation. This protein S-glutathionylation regulates
protein activity in a number of signaling pathways. Despite the continuing advance on identification of
glutathionylated proteins, identification of the specific glutathionylated cysteines that control definite biological
functions has been challenging. To provide the insights into the glutathionylation-susceptibility of global cysteines,
we have developed a chemical proteomic approach, termed clickable glutathione, that enables to study S-
glutathionylation. In this proposal, we will develop an integrative strategy combining our chemical proteomic
platforms with functional biological analyses to streamline identification of glutathionylation-susceptible cysteines
that control cell migration. First, we aim to identify glutathionylation-sensitive cysteines in mammalian cell lines
during cell migration induced by D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) with D-Ala, which produces spatiotemporal and
magnitude-controlled levels of H2O2. We will use our quantitative proteomics and bioinformatic analyses to
identify a group of cysteines highly susceptible to glutathionylation and functionally related to migration. Because
of the importance of localized H2O2 production, the strategy will be extended to the use of localized DAAO/D-Ala
systems to determine localization-dependent glutathionylation of global cysteines. Second, we aim to determine
regulatory roles of the identified glutathionylated cysteines in cell migration. In preliminary studies, we identified
the redox-active glutathionylated cysteines in three proteins, PP2Cα, ARHGEF7, and NISCH, which increase
cell migration in functional analyses. We will investigate glutathionylation-susceptibility of three proteins and their
downstream signaling pathways mediated by glutathionylation. Lastly, we will apply a combination of chemical
proteomics, bioinformatics, and functional screening analyses to find new glutathionylation-susceptible proteins
that regulate cell migration."

Compelling evidence has emerged to implicate cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation as a causal contributor to
morbidity and mortality in sepsis-associated respiratory failure. A phase 3 randomized placebo-controlled trial
called “GRAIL Phase 3” is planned to determine whether the use of an antiviral drug called ganciclovir can
safely and effectively prevent reactivation of CMV and improve clinical outcomes in adults with sepsis-
associated acute respiratory failure.
As a companion to the UG3 GRAIL Phase 3 Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC) application, this U24
application proposes to establish and operate a U24 GRAIL Phase 3 Data Coordinating Center (DCC) to
provide statistical and data management support for the proposed GRAIL Phase 3 trial. The DCC application
has four aims:
• Aim 1. Overall trial administration and coordination. The DCC will assist the CCC with overall trial
 operations, interactions and functions, including communication and coordination among the CCC, trial
 sites, and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).
• Aim 2. Protocol development, data management, and statistical Support. The DCC will collaborate in
 protocol development for GRAIL Phase 3. It will provide statistical leadership in trial design, choice of
 endpoint, power/sample size calculation, interim safety monitoring plan, and statistical analysis plan. The
 DCC will also use state-of-the-art electronic tools for flexible and reliable data collection and management.
• Aim 3. Quality assurance, Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) service, and document
 management. The DCC will assist with reviewing and establishing the required NHLBI processes for
 quality assurance. Working with the GRAIL Phase 3 DSMB, the DCC will assist with developing the DSMB
 Charter, and preparing open and closed DSMB reports. The DCC will establish a procedure for
 documenting and handling protocol deviations/violations during the GRAIL Phase 3 trial.
• Aim 4. Close-out activities and post GRAIL Phase 3 data management. The DCC will assist with the
 CCC for trial close-out activities. It will assist with preparing, reviewing, and submitting GRAIL Phase 3
 manuscripts and presentations for timely dissemination of trial results. The DCC will also prepare final
 annotated datasets for resource sharing."

Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic autoimmune condition whose only currently available treatment is a strict,
burdensome gluten-free diet (GFD). The current proposal uses a theory-driven empirical approach for
optimizing the GFD for teens and their parents by targeting knowledge, behavior, and coping skills through
educational and cognitive behavioral techniques. Integration with telehealth and SMS (short-message service;
“text”) technology for delivering the intervention has the potential reduce barriers to specialized treatment at
both early and later stages of implementation. This mentored K23 award aligns with NIDDK's mission to
“conduct and support medical research and research training and to disseminate science-based information” to
conditions such as digestive diseases to improve people's health and quality of life. The proposed training and
research plan will provide the necessary experience and training opportunities for the candidate to achieve a
long-term career as an independent clinical researcher in optimizing CD treatment for youth and their families.
The proposed K23 project and training plan is designed achieve this goal through advanced training in (1)
Developing and evaluating patient-centered family interventions in real-world settings; (2) Utilization and
statistical analysis of technology for behavioral interventions; (3) Measuring self-management in youth with
chronic GI illness; and (4) Enhancing intervention-based grant writing skills and research dissemination. The
proposed research and training plan is fully supported by the institution (Children's National Hospital) and will
be guided by a multidisciplinary team of two co-mentors and four scientific advisors with expertise in family
interventions for pediatric chronic illness (Dr. Streisand, Primary Mentor, Dr. Hinds, Co-Mentor, and Dr.
Opipari-Arrigan, Advisor), CD treatment and evaluation of GFD management (Drs. Kerzner and Liu), and
advanced research methods (Dr. Bost). The proposed research will refine and test a behavioral intervention for
teens with CD and their parents using an iterative stakeholder-centered design. It will consist of refinement of a
behavioral intervention for use with teens (ages 12-16) and their parents through a series of focus groups (n=5
dyads), followed by proof of concept testing (n=5 dyads) and a small pilot RCT (n=60 dyads). Proof of concept
testing will examine intervention feasibility, acceptability, impact, and lead to further refinements based on
feedback. The RCT will examine preliminary efficacy of the intervention and its impact on QOL and GFD
management by targeting self-efficacy, illness identity, and food-related activities. The innovative and
significant data resulting from this K23 will directly position the candidate to secure future funding as an
independent investigator. This research would provide preliminary data to support a large-scale RCT of the
intervention, with continued leveraging of technology such as telehealth and text messaging to facilitate access
and reach. This work has the potential to make a lasting impact on the standards of care and available
treatments to optimize CD management in youth and their families."

Cirrhosis is a highly morbid and resource intensive condition that afflicts an increasing number of individuals in
the US. The epidemiology of cirrhosis, however is changing, with demographic shifts and increasing
prevalence of metabolic and alcohol associated liver disease. We lack sufficient tools for risk stratification of
the changing population of patients with cirrhosis, as our current prognostic models for compensated cirrhosis
lack adequate discrimination. Furthermore, patients with cirrhosis have symptoms and quality of life deficits
that are not routinely addressed in clinical practice. Patient reported outcomes (PROs) can be incorporated into
risk models with excellent prognostic discrimination. Patients with cirrhosis have a risk of deadly complications
such as hepatic decompensation or hepatocellular carcinoma, however we lack disease modifying agents that
can forestall the development of these complication. Several epidemiological studies suggest statins may be
associated with a decreased risk of cirrhosis related decompensation, however we lack prospective data to
support its use for this indication. In Aim 1 of this proposal, as part of a multicenter consortium, we aim to
recruit a large contemporary longitudinal cohort of patients with compensated cirrhosis from our Hepatology
practice at the University of Michigan, which follows over 1,900 patients with cirrhosis longitudinally. We will
perform serial measurements of clinical, liver fibrosis, PRO, functional, and laboratory parameters over the
study period. As part of the PRO measurement, will develop automated alerts with care pathways within the
electronic medical record to alert providers for alcohol use disorder in patients enrolled in the cohort. In Aim 2,
we will develop and validate multidimensional risk models, incorporating the longitudinal parameters measured
in Aim 1, in order to predict outcomes, including survival, hepatic decompensation, cardiovascular events, and
disability. In Aim 3 we will perform a randomized placebo control trial of statins in patients with compensated
cirrhosis. The primary outcome will be overall survival, with secondary outcomes of hepatic
decompensation/hepatocellular carcinoma development and cardiovascular events. We will perform additional
exploratory analyses to determine the impact of statins on fibrosis progression. This proposal will provide
critical information that will have profound clinical impact on the management of patients with cirrhosis. We are
well positioned to conduct this study given our Hepatology and clinical research infrastructure."

multimodal neuroimaging and clinical research methods skills to support his career objective of establishing a
line of research investigating reward brain circuitry as a shared etiological vulnerability to substance use
disorder and major mood disorder co-occurrence. With this award, the applicant will investigate the structure
and function of reward brain circuitry in co-occurring alcohol use disorder (AUD) and bipolar disorder
(AUD+BD) which remains largely unknown to support the development of more precise neurobiological targets
for the treatment of AUD+BD. The proposed career development and training plan is directly aligned with his
prior experience in child/family clinical psychology, social reward and decision-making, utilization of high-risk
designs, and ongoing adult AUD(+/-BD) neuroimaging research. With the support of this renowned mentorship
team, the applicant will: 1) gain advanced knowledge and proficiency in functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI), diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), and sophisticated analyses with these data; 2) develop a deep
understanding of the neurobiology of AUD and BD from adolescence into adulthood; 3) become highly adept at
conducting family-related alcohol and BD clinical research; and 4) improve his grantsmanship for a smooth
transition to research independence. These goals will be achieved through rigorous hands-on training in fMRI
and DKI; the successful completion of neuroimaging statistics coursework with expert consultation support;
guided reading series on AUD and BD neurobiology, assessment, and treatment; intensive mentorship in
conducting neuroimaging research with families; and the successful completion of various on-campus
grantsmanship trainings. The objective of the proposed multimodal neuroimaging study is to define reward
brain circuitry structure and function among sets of parents with AUD+BD and their unaffected adolescent
offspring (dyads) against dyads defined by parental AUD alone (n=25 per group). This study is directly aligned
with two foremost NIAAA initiatives through focus on increasing understanding of AUD neurobiology in the
context of co-occurring psychopathology across age groups. The proposed aims will measure reward circuitry
brain function using social reward and decision-making fMRI tasks paired with DKI for measurement of white
matter (WM) pathway microstructure. The central hypotheses are: 1) sets of adults and their unaffected
offspring (dyads) with AUD+BD relative to AUD alone will exhibit hyperactivation to reward (with perturbed
functional connectivity) due to BD co-occurrence, and 2) WM microstructural integrity will be reduced in sets of
AUD+BD dyads relative to AUD dyads. The results of this K23 study will generate important preliminary data
for a longitudinal R01 establishing reward-related endophenotypes for AUD+BD patients who are currently
underserved by existing clinical treatments. The applicant will receive support and guidance from expert
mentors successfully conducting AUD+BD studies for the past 10+ years."

Oral mucositis, a severe oral ulceration, is a common toxic effect of radio- or chemoradio-therapy (RT or CRT)
and a limiting factor to using the optimal dose of radiation for effective cancer treatment. Intensity modulated RT
(IMRT) and stereotactic Body RT (SBRT) spare more normal tissues and lessen chronic side effects, but not
oral mucosa in head and neck cancer patients. To date, Palifermin, a protein derived from keratinocyte growth
factor, is the only targeted therapy approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for preventing oral
mucositis in patients with hematopoietic malignancy followed by bone marrow transplant (4% of the at-risk
population), but it has no effect on existing mucositis. Allander Biotechnologies has developed a proprietary
biologic that shows prophylactic and therapeutic effects on radiation-induced oral mucositis in mice and dogs
upon topical application to oral mucosa. Our biologic possesses multiple functions needed for oral mucositis
healing. Under the previous SBIR Phase II funding supporting Allander’s drug development, we have 1) identified
the lead drug and formulated it as oral gel; established the manufacture platform and quality control (QC) panels
ready to be implemented for quality assurance (QA) for certified Good Manufacture Practice (cGMP); 2)
established efficacy dose range in dogs that be scaled to the treatment dose in human oral mucositis patients;
3) defined pharmacodynamics (PD) based on mechanisms of actions; 4) de-risked toxicity and oncogenic
potential; 5) developed pharmacokinetics (PK) PK/Toxicokinetic (TK) and immunogenic assays needed for
toxicology studies and clinical trial. Under this Commercialization Readiness Program (CRP) application, we will:
a) manufacture our drug under Good Engineering Practice (GEP) conditions to supply the Good Lab Practice
(GLP) toxicology studies; b) perform in-use dose formulation tests of our drug in toxicology studies and finalize
dose-formulation analyses to be used in clinical trial; c) perform systemic GLP toxicology studies in small and
large animal species with the safety data to support future maximum clinical dose. The milestones under this
funding are to apply for Investigational New Drug (IND) of our drug and receive approval from the FDA to initiate
our Phase I clinical trial. Our ultimate goal is to complete the first-in-human Phase I trial and initiate Phase II/III
trials afterwards and file a New Drug Application (NDA) after completing clinical trials."
10831836,"In sexually reproducing organisms, the flow of genetic information from parent to offspring relies on
meiosis, a specialized cell division where haploid gametes are produced from diploid cells. Successful
chromosome segregation in meiosis requires pairing, synapsis, and crossover formation between homologous
chromosomes during prophase I. Synapsis involves the assembly of a zipper-like protein structure called the
synaptonemal complex (SC) that forms between two paired homologs and functions as a scaffold for crossover
recombination. Recent evidence shows that the SC has liquid crystalline properties, allowing for chromosome-
wide signal transduction to regulate the number and distribution of crossovers. In C. elegans, SC materials form
spherical aggregates in the absence of chromosome axes, called polycomplexes, and recruit factors required
for crossover formation as a single focus, recapitulating its robust crossover control in normal meiosis. Despite
the conserved structure and function of the SC, it remains unknown what drives phase separation of the SC and
how its liquid-like properties are regulated during meiotic progression. Polo-like kinases (PLKs) are a family of
conserved cell-cycle kinases that orchestrate meiotic prophase events via waves of phosphorylation. This
proposal is based on my preliminary data hinting that PLKs provide the liquid-like properties of the SC and its
affinity to crossover factors in the genetically tractable model organism C. elegans. Here I propose to further
elucidate the role of PLKs by combining C. elegans genetics, live imaging, biochemical purification, and
quantitative phosphoproteomics. In Aim 1, I will use a strain lacking chromosome axes as an experimental
platform and perform time-lapse microscopy of SC polycomplexes to determine how PLKs modulate their fusion,
sphericity, and turnover. Liquid-liquid phase separation is often regulated in space and time by phosphorylation.
In Aim 2, I will test the hypothesis that PLKs regulate dynamic properties of the SC by phosphorylating its
components during meiotic progression. I will purify biochemical quantities of SC materials from C. elegans
lysates with or without PLK-2 and map PLK-mediated phosphorylation sites by comparing levels of
phosphopeptides within the SC using mass spectrometry and chemical labeling. This effort will be complemented
by my ongoing work using phospho-specific antibodies, which I have raised against several PLK consensus
motifs within the disordered C-terminal tails of two paralogous SC components, SYP-5 and SYP-6. SYP-5 and
SYP-6 are robustly phosphorylated upon meiotic entry in a PLK-dependent manner, and this is critical for
initiating SC assembly in early meiotic prophase. I will continue to characterize PLK phosphosites within the SC
by raising phospho-specific antibodies. I will determine the biological significance of conserved PLK
phosphorylation sites by targeted mutagenesis. Overall, this work will provide insights into the mechanisms by
which conserved cell cycle kinases regulate SC dynamics and will be broadly applicable across species,
including humans."
10870203,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Mitochondrial diseases are caused by mutations in genes that encode structural mitochondrial proteins or
proteins involved in mitochondrial function. Mitochondrial function abnormalities are among the most common
genetic neurological disorders, making them an ideal therapeutic target. The growing knowledge of links between
aberrant mitochondrial gene transcription and human diseases critically necessitates an effective approach to
controlling mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) transcription. To this end, developing a method to modulate mtDNA
transcription sites specifically is vital for understanding and treating mitochondria-related diseases. However, the
Inefficient delivery of DNA binding motifs into mitochondria and difficulty activating mitochondria genes with
current technologies limit mitochondrial genome editing/gene manipulation. Advanced techniques for regulating
mtDNA transcription have relied on the delivery of exogenous transcription factors, such as mitochondrial
transcription factor A (TFAM), DNA oligomers, or DNA-base editing nucleases. Furthermore, translating these
advanced tools into therapeutics would require substantial advances in their targeted delivery into mitochondria,
as most mitochondrial transcription factors (TFs) and base editing tools face significant hurdles during circulation
in blood or other biofluids. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel methods to achieve selective and
efficient gene activation in the mitochondria.
 Addressing the above challenges, the main goal of this proposal is to develop a nanoparticle-based
synthetic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) transcription regulator to investigate mitochondrial dysfunction in
neurodegeneration. The modular MitoScript platform will be assembled from: i) ultra-small fluorescent gold
nanoclusters (NC) as scaffolds for assembly of biomolecular ligands; ii) synthetic PIP oligomers as mtDNA
binding domains (DBDs) for site-specific mitochondrial transcription regulation; iii) mitochondria-penetrating
peptides (MPPs) as mitochondrial localization domains; and iv) a mitochondrial transcription factor motif derived
from TFAM as an activation domain (AD). By doing so, we aim to construct an artificial/synthetic mitochondrial
TF that can: i) efficiently target mitochondria genes with no cytotoxic effects or immunogenic (e.g., viral vectors)
carriers; ii) selectively bind to any target DNA sequences in the mitochondria genome, and iii) controllably
downregulate and upregulate mitochondria genes that can eventually alter neural cell fates.
 We propose to objectively test our central hypothesis and achieve our objectives by addressing the following
specific aims: AIM #1 − Construct ND6-targeting MitoScript (ND6-MitoScript) to regulate ND6 genes in mitochondria
efficiently; AIM #2 − Validate ND6-MitoScript for ND6 gene overexpression and improved survival in PD patient iPSC-
derived neurons; Collectively, we anticipate that our proposed studies will provide an innovative, highly effective,
and selective method for developing therapeutic interventions for mtDNA-mediated neurological disorders."
10831834,"PROPOSAL SUMMARY
For years, nature has been the source for health remedies in traditional medicine, using plants and fungi for their
curative benefits for over 2000 years. We can now attribute the benefits of these traditional treatments to natural
products generated in their biosynthetic pathways. Moreover, natural products have been a consistent source of
inspiration and resource in the development of alternative therapeutics. However, studies show that there is a
gap in knowledge on these alternatives which is rooted in a lack of evidence-based information on their efficacy,
hindering their application in mainstream medicine. Therefore, it is imperative to develop strategies that could
allow to reach the valuable molecules that give these sources their medicinal power. A subset of natural products
contains tropolone rings in their structures and have shown to have great therapeutic potential for treating cancer,
malaria, bacterial and fungal infections as well as cardiovascular, renal, and inflammatory diseases. The
tropolone moiety commonly acts as a pharmacophore, making it a valuable target to synthetically access and
evaluate. However, the complex nature of the aromatic seven-membered tropolone ring limits the sustainability
of their large-scale production, this reflected in common synthetic methods being hindered by low yields, diverse
functional group tolerance, and the need for hazardous and costly reagents. Conversely, nature has evolved
biocatalysts that enable direct routes to diversely functionalized tropolones such as the fungal α-ketoglutarate
dependent non-heme iron dioxygenase XenC, bypassing the general setbacks of traditional synthetic methods.
Nonetheless, the applicability of this enzymatic method remains hindered by the concentration of substrate that
XenC can tolerate, the required two-step reaction sequence, and the limited substrate scope that prevents the
practical applications of this approach to access a plethora of tropolone natural products. In the efforts of
improving the scalability, sustainability, and broader applicability of this biocatalytic method towards accessing
bioactive tropolones, I aim to engineer XenC into an enzyme that tolerates higher substrate loadings, works in a
sustainable one-pot cascaded at pH 8, and has a broader non-native substrate scope. The successfully evolved
enzymes and the developed biocatalytic platform will enable novel chemoenzymatic syntheses of tropolone
sesquiterpenes, fungal marine tropolones, and tropolone alkaloids, providing a scalable and sustainable strategy
that allows to reach diverse tropolones and analogs to facilitate their in-depth pharmacological studies. In turn,
this will impulse the development of novel medicine alternatives with the purpose of treating human-health
concerns including infections, inflammation, malaria, and cancer."
10954706,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is the 4th leading cause of cancer related deaths and has a dismal 5-year survival rate of 10%. Lethality is attributed to early metastasis, late detection, and therapeutic resistance. Cytotoxic CD8 T cells are the principal mediators of immune surveillance and critical for cancer eradication. However, in PDA and other cancers, CD8 T cells progressively lose their cytotoxic function, and are thus characterized as exhausted. Immune checkpoint blockade aims to correct T cell exhaustion by blocking inhibitory signaling and has revolutionized the treatment of many malignancies. However, PDA is largely resistant. As such, this grant seeks to understand the mechanisms driving CD8 T cell exhaustion in PDA and how PDA evades an activated immune response after immunotherapy treatment. Additionally, this grant will study cancer cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic mechanisms of PDA metastasis, to develop rational therapies. My lab derived new cancer cell lines from immunotherapy resistant tumors, termed escape variants, to study mechanisms of immune evasion. I found that orthotopic implantation of escape variant cells into immunocompetent mice yields multi-organ metastatic disease, which is not seen with the immunotherapy na·1ve cell line. Thus, escape variant tumors can model metastatic disease of PDA patients. Bulk RNA sequencing identified a single gene, Ddr2, that was significantly upregulated across multiple escape variant lines compared to immunotherapy na""ive cells. Ddr2 encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase, is linked to metastasis in other malignancies, and is correlated with reduced patient survival in PDA. Investigation into the tumor microenvironment of escape variant tumors identified an accumulation of intratumoral regulatory T cells (Tregs). I found that Treg depletion significantly reduced tumor burden and metastasis and reduced the development of CD8 T cell exhaustion. I will test the central hypothesis that immunotherapy selects for metastatic cancer cells that promote intratumoral Tregs that cause CD8 T cell dysfunction. In the first Aim, I will investigate how immunotherapy escape drives Treg accumulation and metastasis. First, I will test if Treg accumulation occurs through conventional CD4 T cell differentiation within the tumor. Next, I will test if forced expression of Ddr2 drives metastasis and ablation of Ddr2 prevents metastasis. In the second Aim, I will identify the CD8 T cell subset critical for preventing PDA metastasis. First, I will determine if CD8 T cells are required for the reduction in tumor burden and abrogation of metastasis seen with Treg depletion. Next, I will use single cell RNA sequencing to identify the transcriptional signature of anti-metastatic CD8 T cells enriched with Treg depletion. Completion of the proposed research strategy will reveal mechanisms of metastasis and CD8 T cell dysfunction in PDA and identify a therapeutic target(s) in the hope of reducing PDA lethality."

 Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) establishes lifelong infection in 95% of adults worldwide. EBV
causes multiple cancers, particularly in hosts with HIV co-infection. EBV is transmitted between
hosts through saliva, from which it translocates across the oral cavity and tonsillar epithelium to
reach the B-cell compartment. In persons with AIDS, EBV lytic replication causes oral hairy
leukoplakia. Upon B-cell infection, the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) EBV genome is delivered
to the nucleus. Much remains to be learned about host pathways that sense incoming EBV
genomes, as well as viral genomes in cells undergoing lytic replication, and how EBV interacts
with these restriction pathways. We used RNAseq and multiplexed tandem mass tag (TMT)
mass spectrometry to create temporal proteomic maps of primary human B-cell infection and of
EBV lytic replication. Each highlighted that EBV strongly and specifically downmodulates the
SMC5/6 cohesin complex within 1 day of primary B-cell infection, prior to the expression of most
viral genes, and again upon lytic reactivation. We identified that the EBV major tegument protein
BNRF1 assembles a Cullin-7 based ubiquitin ligase that targets SMC5/6 for proteasomal
degradation. In the absence of BNRF1, SMC5/6 shuts down EBV lytic replication compartments
and blocks EBV lytic DNA synthesis. CRISPR SMC6 knockout rescues replication compartment
formation in Burkitt cells carrying BNRF1 knockout EBV. To our knowledge, SMC5/6 is therefore
the first host factor that can restrict EBV replication compartments. However, little is known
about how SMC5/6 recognizes EBV genomes as foreign. This important question has remained
open across double stranded DNA viral genomes, where focus has instead been on how
viruses evade SMC5/6. Our central hypothesis is that the SMC5/6 cohesin recognizes and
restricts viral non-B-form DNA structures necessary for EBV latency establishment and
lytic DNA replication in a manner modulated by BNRF1. Our Aims are to (1) Identify how
SMC5/6 senses and restricts latent EBV DNA in newly infected cells and to (2) Identify how
SMC5/6 senses and restricts lytic EBV DNA upon reactivation. Collectively, these studies
address the key open question about how SMC5/6 functions in order to discriminate viral from
host DNA, which has remained nearly unstudied despite growing recognition of SMC5/6 roles in
regulation of double stranded viral DNA."
10916400,"COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT CORE: PROJECT SUMMARY
The Community Outreach and Engagement Core nurtures and disseminates innovative work at the
intersection of diabetes prevention and treatment and American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) within a
translational framework. Two distinct, but related strategies characterize our approach to achieving this goal.
The first strategy entails strengthening current collaborations and establishing new ones with Native advocacy
groups, tribal communities and their leaders, providers and administrators in the Indian Health Service, tribal,
and urban Indian health care system, policymakers, and other research intensive universities. Our purpose is
to sustain a research agenda of this nature, and to subsequently apply the resulting knowledge to the benefit
of Native people at risk of or suffering from diabetes. The second strategy recognizes that health research
benefits patients and communities only if scientists and health professionals use effective ways to
communicate new findings across community settings and into clinical practices. Thus, we consider how
health information is consumed in Native communities and explore creative ways to disseminate such
information and research findings to community members, the health professionals providing their care, the
systems responsible for these healthcare needs, organizations advocating for relevant policy, as well as
interested researchers. These activities will build capacity for advancing diabetes translation research in AI/AN
communities. Our vision is to promote the Center for American Indian and Alaska Native Diabetes Translation
Research as a national resource that contributes to developing new methods, technologies, and approaches
to disseminating innovative, goal-directed diabetes translation research specific to Native people."
10916405,"NATIONAL RESOURCE CORE: PROJECT SUMMARY
American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) communities are at substantial risk of diabetes. Consequently, In
1997, Congress created the Special Diabetes Program for Indians to fund diabetes prevention and treatment
programs throughout Indian Country. This initiative led to substantial improvement in blood glucose, blood
pressure, and cholesterol levels among AI/ANs with diabetes, accompanied by significant decline in diabetes-
related end-stage renal disease. Yet the lessons from this exciting work have been slow to be learned. The
Center for American Indian and Alaska Native Diabetes Translation Research (CAIANDTR) at the University of
Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus (UC/AMC) addresses this problem by extending the knowledge, skills,
and experience of our Research Base – drawing from UC/AMC faculty and those at our 7 Satellite Centers –
that emphasizes 6 specialty areas, including cultural adaptations of intervention, health literacy, health
technologies, dissemination and implementation science, sustainability, and qualitative research methods -- to
facilitate a multidisciplinary, culturally grounded, problem-oriented translational research program of major
scientific and programmatic importance. This Core promotes the dissemination of such work and rigorously
evaluates the impact of the training, technical assistance, and consultations provided to external investigators,
programs, and institutional partners in the U.S. work with AI/AN communities to advance diabetes translational
research and reduce resulting disparities."
10697478,"Interleukin (IL)-33 and its receptor, ST2, centrally control a remarkable variety of inflammatory and fibrotic
diseases. The IL-33 – ST2 axis relies mostly on the proteolytically mature form of IL-33 cytokine (MIL33), with
less attention usually devoted to the full-length precursor (FLIL33), which is a nuclear factor. The MIL33 – ST2
axis serves diverse functions, among which one of the most prominent is induction of the Th2 phenotype, with
an overt elevation of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, leading to eosinophilia, mucus production, and clinical manifestation
of allergy. It remains unclear how the MIL33 – ST2 pathway, while certainly contributing to inflammation and
fibrosis, mediates its proinflammatory and profibrotic effects without always eliciting the Th2 phenotype. Our
preliminary data strongly suggest that IL-33, particularly in its FLIL33 form, may promote inflammation and
fibrosis in an ST2-independent fashion, and reciprocally, ST2 may control inflammation and fibrosis without
requiring IL-33. Thus, we proposed, for the first time, that IL-33 and ST2 may contribute to inflammation and
fibrosis in an “off-axis” fashion. FLIL33 behaves distinctly from MIL33. Some earlier studies suggested that as
a basally and inducibly expressed nuclear factor, FLIL33 modulates inflammatory responses, wound healing,
chromatin stability, and transcriptional regulation in a non-Th2 and receptor-independent manner. Yet, the
pathophysiology of the understudied FLIL33 requires more attention in general and is nearly completely
unknown in fibrosis specifically. Our published and preliminary data suggest that: FLIL33 but not MIL33
potentiates fibrosis without inducing the Th2 phenotype; such distinct effect is partially mediated by ST2 and
also occurs in the absence of ST2; FLIL33 acts so at the levels of both transcriptional and post-transcriptional
regulation; ST2 by itself controls fibrosis; and such regulation involves IL-9.
Based on these findings, the Hypothesis of this study is that in addition to the commonly acknowledged role of
the MIL33 – ST2 axis, FLIL33 contributes to fibrosis both with and without engaging ST2, through both
transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation, and that ST2 itself may regulate fibrosis through a
mechanism that in part involves IL-9. To challenge this hypothesis, the following Specific Aims will be pursued.
Aim 1 is to define ST2-independent, Th2-independent, post-transcriptional, mechanisms through which full-
length IL-33 potentiates fibrosis. Aim 2 is to define ST2-dependent, Th2-independent, transcriptional,
mechanisms through which full-length IL-33 potentiates fibrosis. Aim 3 is to determine the role of IL-9 in
controlling fibrosis in an ST2-dependent fashion and identify the mechanisms through which both full-length
and mature IL-33 forms attenuate IL-9. A successful completion of these studies will form the basis for better
therapeutic targeting of IL-33 and ST2 is inflammatory and fibrotic diseases. Inflammation and fibrosis are
distinct yet frequently co-occurring processes contributing to a remarkably broad variety of diseases of every
organ and tissue. The inflammatory fibrotic diseases affect the general population; but are particularly
prevalent in Veterans because of their military service-related exposures as well as their often-unhealthy post-
service lifestyles. The central regulatory role of interleukin (IL)-33 as a potent inducer of inflammation and
fibrosis has been solidly established, but the molecular mechanisms of IL-33 biology and pathology are not
fully understood - a limitation that will be addressed by the planned work based on our innovative, paradigm-
shifting, hypothesis. Importantly, both FLIL33 and MIL33 become pathophysiologically engaged under stress,
but IL-33-null mice have no noticeable basal phenotype, suggesting that depletion of IL-33 levels and/or
attenuation of its functions are a safe therapeutic approach. Altogether, the results of this work will uncover
novel aspects of IL-33 biology and form the basis for the development of novel, precise therapeutic modalities
for Veterans with inflammatory and fibrotic diseases."
10813046,"Research in the Chen lab focuses on alleviating the neurological sequelae of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and
ischemic stroke, which diminish our veterans’ quality of life. Our goals are to help identify and/or develop
pharmacologic agents that can leverage phylogenetically conserved tissue-repair mechanisms to alleviate acute
and secondary brain damage and sustain functional recovery.
TBI is a major concern for US military veterans. In TBI survivors, white matter injury is associated with long-term
functional deficits, including sensorimotor, cognitive, and psychiatric impairments. The Chen lab will continue to
develop restorative therapies that augment endogenous repair processes. Supported by VA Merit Review, we
found that the functional phenotypes of brain innate immune cells, including resident microglia and infiltrating
blood-borne macrophages, critically regulate the microenvironment in white matter and impact both white matter
injury and repair. We have recently identified salt-inducible kinase-1 (SIK1), an evolutionarily conserved protein
kinase, as a key molecular switch that governs the functional states of innate immune brain cells after TBI. Thus,
in the next four years, we will test the new hypotheses that genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of SIK1
improves white matter restoration and long-term TBI outcomes through dual mechanisms: 1) protecting against
early synaptic and axonal injury by inflammation-resolving microglia/macrophage responses, and 2) enhancing
chronic-stage white matter repair. Our preliminary data suggest that SIK1 inhibition not only reduces TBI-induced
sensorimotor and cognitive deficits, but also the psychiatric symptoms relevant to post-traumatic stress disorder
(PTSD). We believe that continued positive outcomes of this research will accelerate the development of novel
therapies to promote successful rehabilitation of veterans with TBI.
Stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability in elderly US veterans. Approximately 11,000 veterans are
hospitalized annually with new strokes. Although survival has increased with improvements in emergency care
and new recanalization therapy, the population with disabilities continues to climb. Optimal care of our veterans
will require therapies that not only ameliorate brain injury—but also lead to regeneration of brain tissue and
restoration of neurological function. Post-stroke immune responses have a substantial impact on the progression
of ischemic brain injury and brain recovery, but there are no clinical treatments that successfully harness the
restorative power of the immune system while also tempering inflammation-induced secondary injuries. The
reasons for this gap are multifactorial, but include a preclinical overemphasis on young adult animals, which do
not display the same pathophysiological mechanisms underlying brain ischemia as the aged. Using a clinically
relevant stroke model in 20-month old aging mice, our VA-funded research helped us make two key discoveries:
1) the remarkably reduced ability of aged brains to recover from stroke is, at least in part, due to microglial aging
and the impaired reparative functions of microglia; 2) aged microglia and post-stroke brain-repair functions of
microglia can be rejuvenated by activating the retinoid X receptor (RXR) in the aged brain. In the new VA-funded
research, we will test the ability of bexarotene, an FDA-approved RXR agonist with excellent safety profiles, to
reactivate the brain repair-enhancing functions of microglia, thereby improving long-term stroke outcomes and
functional recovery in aged animals. Thus, our long-term goals are to improve veterans’ lives after stroke and
reduce the socioeconomic burden of their disabilities."
10887482,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Structural biology is a field with a goal to delineate the physical architecture of biological
macromolecules; a primary structural method employed in this endeavor is macromolecular X-
ray crystallography (MX). MX methods account for nearly 90% of the greater than 165,000
structures deposited to the Protein Data Bank, but a primary challenge to successful MX structure
determination is finding conditions in which a macromolecule will crystallize. To address this
obstacle, an arsenal of chemical cocktail screens and high-throughput screening methods,
coupled with specialized imaging, have been brought to bear on the problem of determining the
conditions in which a macromolecular target will form a crystal that is of sufficient quality to be
amenable to X-ray diffraction structure determination. This proposal focuses on continuing and
extending the capabilities of a central resource providing critical high-throughput crystallization
screening to the scientific community, the High-Throughput Crystallization Screening Center
(HTX) at Hauptman-Woodward Medical Research Institute. The HTX Center has been in
operation for two decades, providing a unique national crystallization resource specifically geared
to help overcome the obstacle of coaxing a macromolecule to crystallize. The HTX Center
provides a high-throughput screening format designed to minimize sample requirements via use
of small volume liquid-handling robotics, a unique experimental set-up, and state-of-the-art
imaging for screening. Notably, the technologies, instruments, and expertise available at the HTX
Center are not widely available. This proposal focuses on extending the capabilities of the HTX
Center by developing an expanded repertoire of experimental screening options and improved
image analysis and processing, while performing instrumentation upgrades to maintain the HTX
Center as a premier resource for crystallization screening for the scientific user community. We
propose developing and implementing the necessary computational infrastructure and software
to accommodate new screening plate definitions and optimization of successful crystallization
hits, and improved user interfaces to maximize the information accessibility from screening
experiment outcomes. A major goal of this proposal is to increase access to the state-of-the-art
crystallization screening instrumentation and expertise to researchers from a wide array of
laboratories in academic, non-profit and government institutes, with an objective to ensure access
that enables a broad range of biomedically important research."

Critical illness leads to incident mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) in many older adults. Roughly 2.5 million older adults are admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) annually in the United States; of those, 1 in 4 have a degree of impairment similar in severity to mild ADRD 12 months after their ICU stay. Recognizing MCI or ADRD following critical illness is crucial for connecting patients and their caregivers with support, providing care recommendations known to decrease the progression of MCI to Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and ultimately improving our understanding of modifiable risk factors that lead to this complication. As such, experts across disciplines recommend screening for MCI or AD following critical illness in high-risk patients; however, this has not been widely adopted. The overall objective of this mentored career development award is to obtain additional training in cognitive assessment and implementation science and use a mixed-methods approach to develop and pilot-test an implementation program to support screening for incident MCI or ADRD following critical illness in older adults. Aim 1 will develop and test a prediction model for incident MCI or AD following critical illness using Medicare claims data and then re-calibrate that model for use in the electronic health record (EHR), providing experiential learning in integrating prediction modeling with EHR data. In Aim 2, I will learn to use qualitative data to inform implementation by identifying facilitators and barriers to implementing cognitive screening specifically in the post-ICU population. In Aim 3, I will gain experience with the design and conduct of a pilot implementation trial and determine the feasibility and potential impact of Anticipating Dementia and Providing Therapy (ADAPT), an implementation program designed to support screening for MCI or ADRD following critical illness in our health system. I will capitalize on the outstanding research environment at Wake Forest School of Medicine as well as the support and guidance of an exceptionally qualified mentorship team (Drs. Williamson, Houston, Hanchate, Birken, Files, Meyer). Through didactic coursework, dedicated mentorship, and hands-on experience, I will obtain the necessary training in the integration of prediction modeling with EHR data, the use of qualitative data to inform implementation, and the design and conduct of a pilot implementation trial. I will also pursue additional training in cognitive assessment methods and geriatric principles, establishing an area of expertise linking critical illness, aging and cognition, and implementation science. This Mentored Patient-Oriented Research K23 will advance our understanding of how best to identify and support older adults with MCI or ADRD after critical illness and it will help me to achieve my long-term goal of becoming an independent physician-scientist dedicated to improving the care we deliver to older adults during and after critical illness."
10698453,"ABSTRACT
Perinatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is one of the most serious birth complications in infants.
Hypoxic ischemia affects 30.6 cases per 1000 live births. The majority (43.5%) have mild HIE, and 34.8 and
21.7% experience moderate to severe HIE. The acute phase of HIE is caused by reduced blood flow and a deficit
in oxygen and glucose in the brain, resulting in neonatal neurologic sequelae (seizures, coma, and hypotonia),
and involves multiple organs (kidney, liver, heart, and intestines). However, approximately 25% of survivors
suffer significant long-term disability including impaired mental and motor development, cerebral palsy, epilepsy,
respiratory difficulties, depressed tone/reflexes, cortical blindness, sensorineural hearing loss, and death.
 Hypothermia has been used to reduce mortality and developmental complications in term infants with
HIE, but it is effective in only 50% of cases, for unclear reasons. Thus, currently, no prophylactic drug or inter-
vention is available to prevent HIE in all cases. The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
reported an urgent need to develop neuroprotective combination therapies to be used hours to days after the
insult in combination with hypothermia. Several known neuroprotective compounds (erythropoietin, stem cells,
xenon, etc.) are being investigated alone or in combination with hypothermia, but, to date, none have emerged
as a more effective treatment for HIE, suggesting an urgent need for new adjuvant therapies to counteract HIE.
 We recently awarded a phase 1 study (STTR) to test the efficacy of moderate hypothermia plus an
immunomodulatory compound, synthetic PreImplantation Factor (sPIF), in a rat model of HIE. We proposed to
examine a short-term dose-ranging study with sPIF plus hypothermia to determine which dose is most effective,
as well as to perform a longer-term comparison of the selected sPIF dose plus hypothermia combination and
compare the results to hypothermia alone. As proposed, we performed sPIF dose (1 mg/kg) both for acute and
longer-term effects with and without moderate hypothermia. Our studies on histology and neurobehavioral test
with sPIF 1 mg/kg plus hypothermia are promising (Please see Significance and Research Design sections for
progress report). Due to a limited time window during the pandemic, we were unable to complete the dose-
ranging study with sPIF plus hypothermia.
 Accordingly, in this phase II study, we will first complete, 1) a dose-response, 2) additional behavioral
and cognitive function tests, and 3) functional MRI. We will then use the same murine model and injury system
to determine 4) the frequency and duration of sPIF exposure, in the presence and absence of hypothermia. We
will then determine 5) the basis of neuroprotection against HII and 6) prepare materials for submission to the
FDA for a type C meeting. BioIncept received Fast-Track FDA designation for sPIF and a safety trial in patients
with autoimmune hepatitis was completed successfully."
10914113,"Oral cancer patients suffer severe chronic and mechanically-induced pain. Opioids are initially
effective, but dose escalation is required and side effects reduce quality of life. The long-term
goal is to improve management of oral cancer and oral cancer pain. Oral cancer pain is initiated
and maintained in the cancer microenvironment. Some overexpressed cancer genes,
oncogenes, can function in an autocrine manner to promote cancer and in a paracrine manner
as cancer pain mediators. The ensemble of altered genes/pathways in a cancer dictates
response to treatment, which motivates the use of combinatorial therapies tailored to the
individual (precision medicine) to both treat the cancer and pain. The overall objectives of this
application are to determine (a) whether artemin (ARTN), a gene overexpressed in oral cancer
is an oral cancer oncogene, (b) whether ARTN is an oral cancer pain mediator and (c) whether
antagonizing ARTN stops oral cancer and alleviates oral cancer pain. The central hypothesis is
that there are oral cancer oncogenes that promote cancer and induce oral cancer pain. The
rationale for this project is that proalgesic oncogenes could be targeted to treat cancer and pain.
The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) Determine if ARTN is a
proalgesic oncogene in human cancer; (2) Determine whether ARTN is an oncogene and a
nociceptive mediator; and (3) Determine the potential to stop oral cancer and alleviate oral
cancer pain by antagonizing proalgesic oncogenes. In the first aim, expression of ARTN will be
assessed by immunohistochemistry in archival specimens from patients who completed the
UCSF Oral Cancer Pain Questionnaire (UCSFOCPQ) to determine if expression is correlated
with pain. The second aim will evaluate the function of ARTN as an oncogene by manipulating
expression in cultured cells in vitro and in human xenograft mouse models. Whether ARTN is a
pain mediator will be assessed by measuring nociception induced by manipulating expression of
ARTN in animal models in the absence of cancer growth. For the third aim, the potential of
antagonizing ARTN to stop cancer and cancer pain will be evaluated by anti-ARTN treatment of
mouse xenograft and carcinogenesis models. The proposed research is innovative in the
applicants' opinion, because it uses information gained from genomic analysis of oral cancers to
identify putative oral cancer proalgesic oncogenes. The research is significant because it is
expected to lay the foundation for future clinical trials assessing the utility of targeting ARTN for
cancer treatment and attenuation of cancer pain. The work will motivate identification of
additional proalgesic oncogenes to improve precision cancer pain management."
10908555,"Project Summary 
The interoceptive link between the lung and CNS carries mechanical and irritant information to its first-order synapse in the brainstem. This information is critical in the newborn and adult for maintenance of pulmonary gas exchange in the face of behavioral changes and environmental stressors, and in orchestrating immune responses to viral, bacterial, and allergic pathogens. Although the fetal lung is richly innervated during development, the connectivity to the central nervous system (CNS), the extent to which these neurons help orchestrate lung and CNS formation over the course of development, and the role they play in function at birth remain largely unknown. This R01 application proposes to address this knowledge gap using a novel fetal sheep model. 
We hypothesize that intrinsic and extrinsic lung interoceptive units play a role in the normal development of the lung and central respiratory control centers. We will test this in the following aims: Aim 1: Traditional dye and novel viral track tracer techniques will be used in fetal sheep at various stages of lung development to delineate the location and connectivity of the interoceptive units within the lung, as well as first- and second-order central circuitry to and above the brainstem. The effect of surgical denervation on lung developmental morphology and the prevalence of various neural populations involved in chemo- and irritant sensation, including A- and C-fiber neurons involved in breathing control, and pulmonary neuroendocrine cells involved in pulmonary mechano- and chemosensation. Finally, single neuron RNAseq will be used to phenotypically characterize neurons within the fetal jugular and nodose ganglia at various stages of development. Aim 2: To test the necessity of interroception on fetal lung development and respiratory function after birth, fetuses in the canalicular stage will be subjected to either bilateral denervation of the lungs or periodic hyperstimulation of mechanoreceptors via overinflation for the remainder of gestation. Pulmonary vascular function, airway mechanics, and gas exchange will then be monitored following c-section delivery and in response to acute hypoxia and methacholine challenges, and responses will be compared to both sham and naive controls. Aim 3: Vagal ascending and descending nerve traffic will be recorded in fetuses instrumented with state-of-the-art cuff electrodes throughout fetal development and at birth. Custom time-series and spectral analysis software will be used to quantify changes in afferent/efferent vagal nerve signaling in response to pulmonary denervation, birth, and mechano- and chemosensory stimulations. 
The outcomes of these studies will fill in critical knowledge gaps of the role of interoception in lung development and function in a sheep model that has been a historically signature model of human perinatal lung development and physiology. Our proposed foundational work will inform future efforts focused on a variety of lung diseases in humans that originate during development, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, apnea of prematurity, sudden infant death syndrome, and asthma."
10814285,"ABSTRACT - Overall
New perinatal HIV infections continue, at a rate of about one every 3-4 minutes, 400 every day, and 3000
every week. For children living with HIV (CLWH), antiretroviral therapy (ART) greatly reduces mortality and
morbidity; however, viral rebound quickly ensues if ART is stopped. HIV persistence in a latent reservoir in
CD4+ T cells that can give rise to rebound viremia is the major barrier to a cure. However, there remains a
significant knowledge gap regarding how the establishment and maintenance of HIV reservoirs are regulated
by the neonatal and childhood immune system. The overall objective of this Program project application is to
generate a comprehensive understanding of the complex host-pathogen interactions critical for HIV reservoir
seeding and persistence such that novel cure strategies truly targeted for the unique immune environment of
CLWH can be created. Our central hypothesis is that the host immune environment during the perinatal
period and throughout childhood and adolescence, influenced by host/microbial metabolites and thymic output,
determines the efficacy of HIV-specific immunity and the nature of reservoir establishment and maintenance.
To test this hypothesis, we have compiled an outstanding team of experienced scientists and early-stage
investigators (ESIs) from the Departments of Pediatrics and Pathology at Emory School of Medicine, with
collaborators from the NIH, Kirby Institute, and the Université de Montréal. The research proposed builds upon
the strong existing collaborations that generated the rigorous foundational research in support of each Project
and develops links between new collaborators. Program oversight, communication plans, and mentoring of
ESIs will be coordinated through the Administrative Core. We propose multiomic experiments in Projects 1-3
with data centralization in the Bioinformatics Core. The overall Specific Aims of our Program are: 1) To
investigate the impact of IL-10, TGF-β, and thymic output on immune function and reservoir establishment and
maintenance in perinatal HIV/SIV infection; 2) To determine the role of CD8+ T cells in reservoir establishment
and maintenance in perinatal HIV/SIV infection; 3) To generate integrative models that define the host immune
determinants of HIV/SIV reservoir establishment and maintenance and predict the size and nature of the HIV
reservoir in CLWH. This deep dive into pediatric immunology will allow for insights to emerge that would not be
possible if each Project were performed in isolation. A better understanding of the vulnerability of HIV
reservoirs to innate and adaptive immune pressure will drive informed approaches to a cure for CLWH. The
research proposed builds on our team’s expertise, the rich resources available at Emory School of Medicine,
Emory National Primate Research Center, Emory Center for AIDS Research, and generous access to
biospecimens from two cohorts of CLWH. We are confident that this Program will lead to important discoveries
regarding immune regulation of the pediatric HIV reservoir and immune dysfunction. It is our mission to turn
these discoveries into clinical trial protocols to advance research towards a cure for children with HIV."
10814286,"ABSTRACT – Administrative Core
This proposed Program’s overarching scientific goal is to understand the immune determinants of pediatric HIV
reservoir establishment and maintenance. To ensure successful completion of the scientific Aims, the
Administrative Core will coordinate oversight of all Program activities, create regulatory and NIH compliance
documentation, and manage data and communication. The Core will serve as the Program hub for ensuring
adherence to biorepository and institutional animal use policies and for coordinating the transfer of specimens
and data. The Core will drive the Program’s focus on regular, consistent communication and will coordinate
meetings to ensure extensive integration across Projects and Cores and to solicit feedback from the external
Advisory Committee. The Administrative Core will also play a key role in ensuring the mentoring of early-stage
investigators (ESIs) in Project Leadership roles, with support from the overall Program PI, Project Co-Leads,
and the Emory Center for AIDS Research (CFAR). The Administrative Core will ensure fiscal accountability
and proactively identify areas in which funds may need to be reallocated. This will be a key service of the
Administrative Core that will help determine study directions in the later years of the project period. This
function will be complemented by purposeful engagement of additional funding opportunities and strategic
planning for future studies based on the results of the Program. The Administrative Core will also serve as the
main contact for financial and data management with the Emory CFAR Cores that will be leveraged in this
Program. Finally, the Core will contribute to Program synergy through the use of collaborative, cloud-based
software that ensures the results generated across Projects are efficiently communicated and can be easily
tracked and updated through the utilization of cloud-based computing outlined in the Bioinformatics Core.
Regular maintenance of shared documents, experimental progress, and milestone achievement will allow for
timely communication with the scientific community including the production of abstracts and manuscripts. The
communication services provided by the Administrative Core will be critical in ensuring the objectives of each
Research Project are met and that findings are disseminated to a broad public. By harnessing Emory’s existing
research support environment and history of collaboration, this Core will ensure rapid Program start-up,
including structure, efficiency, and expertise to support the proposed work."
10814288,"ABSTRACT – Bioinformatics Core
This proposed Program’s overarching scientific goal is to understand the immune determinants of pediatric HIV
reservoir establishment and maintenance. The objective of the Bioinformatics Core is to provide the backbone
structure for this Program for comprehensive large scale multiomic data integration, enabling granular yet
systems-wide analyses to understand pediatric HIV reservoirs. The advent of cutting-edge high-dimensional
single cell technologies - that rely on low blood or tissue input - is quickly aiding the development of tools that
can provide mechanistic insight into HIV in children and identify therapeutic targets for future curative
interventions. The Bioinformatics Core proposes three Specific Aims in support of this research Program. In
Aim 1, the Core will provide biostatistical support and sample/data management and tracking to the Project
members. The Core will leverage the Lab Inventory Management System (LIMS) – OpenSpecimen) offered via
the Emory University information technology infrastructure. In Aim 2, the Core will process and analyze
multiomic data generated by Program investigators using bioinformatics pipelines implementing best-practice
workflow for each omic. In Aim 3, the Bioinformatics Core will integrate multiomic datasets generated in
Projects 1-3. We will then be in a position to build host response network models that depict the metabolic and
immune response cascades that support the establishment and/or maintenance of HIV/SIV reservoirs. These
cascades will be used to build models that predict ways to perturb HIV persistence that can be confirmed in
independent test datasets. Each of the three Projects, while unique in focus, will employ similar and synergistic
methodology to generate big data on the pediatric immune environment. The Bioinformatics Core provides
expertise to combine these immunological, virological, and molecular datasets in meta-analyses and use
machine learning to develop models that give expansive insight into host immune determinants of viral
reservoirs. Altogether the Bioinformatics Core will provide a platform that will guide the identification and
experimental validation of therapeutic interventions that can help limit HIV reservoirs during childhood."
10814292,"ABSTRACT – Project 1
The overall objective of this Program project application is to generate a comprehensive understanding of the
complex host-pathogen interactions critical for HIV reservoir seeding and persistence such that novel cure
strategies truly targeted for the unique immune environment of children living with HIV (CLWH) can be created.
The knowledge gap we address in Project 1 is how the establishment and maintenance of HIV reservoirs are
regulated by the neonatal and childhood immune system, with specific focus on the role of IL-10 and TGF-β on
innate and adaptive immune function, thymic output, survival of infected cells, and virus rebound. Multiple
features of the early life immune environment differ from that of adults, including the active thymus and the
tolerogenic/regulatory bias, with prominent T helper 2 and regulatory CD4+ T cells. The anti-inflammatory
cytokines IL-10 and TGF-β are increased in infants and IL-10 is known to suppress antigen presentation, T cell
effector function, and cell proliferation, while promoting survival of central memory CD4+ T cells. We have
shown that lymph node CD4+ T cells from a subset of SHIV-infected infant rhesus macaques (RMs) that
controlled viremia after analytical treatment interruption (ATI) were notable for an anti-IL-10 gene signature.
The hypothesis to be tested in Project 1 is that IL-10 and TGF-β influence the magnitude of the HIV
reservoir in infants and viral rebound post-ATI, while targeted modulation of IL-10/TGF-β signaling pathways
will impair reservoir persistence and boost the immune responses that lead to post-ATI viral control. In Aim 1,
we will evaluate how the cytokine milieu in infants impacts intact reservoir size, viral rebound, and antiviral
immunity. In Aim 2, we will perform IL-10 blockade using an anti-IL-10 monoclonal antibody in vivo in SIV-
infected infant RMs at the time of ART initiation to define the role of the IL-10 signaling pathway on reservoir
establishment. In Aim 3, we will perform IL-10 blockade in vivo in SIV-infected infant RMs on long-term ART to
determine the impact of IL-10 signaling on reservoir maintenance. Bulk and single-cell multiomic approaches
will be applied in all Aims to identify and validate major immune pathways associated with HIV/SIV reservoirs
and/or viral rebound and to advance our understanding of host-pathogen interactions that dictate virus
persistence in early life. A better understanding of the vulnerability of HIV reservoirs to innate and adaptive
immune pressure will drive informed approaches to a cure for CLWH. The research proposed builds on our
expertise with infant RM models and cutting-edge systems immunology approaches to deeply interrogate
pediatric HIV/SIV. With multidisciplinary approaches, synergies across Projects and Cores, and our highly
collaborative group of established and early-stage investigators, we are confident that Project 1 will lead to
important discoveries regarding immune regulation of the pediatric HIV reservoir and immune dysfunction. It is
our mission to turn these discoveries into clinical trial protocols to advance research towards a cure for children
with HIV."

The overall objective of this Program project application is to generate a comprehensive understanding of the
complex host-pathogen interactions critical for HIV reservoir seeding and persistence such that novel cure
strategies truly targeted for the unique immune environment of children living with HIV (CLWH) can be created.
The knowledge gap we address in Project 2 is how the establishment and maintenance of HIV reservoirs are
regulated by the neonatal and childhood immune system, with specific focus on the cytolytic and non-cytolytic
antiviral role of CD8+ T cells. The drivers of reservoir persistence in CLWH are incompletely understood and
the complexity of the pediatric innate and adaptive immune system across developmental stages contributes to
the challenge of a finding cure for HIV. Mounting evidence in adult models implicates CD8+ T cells as being
required for maintaining HIV suppression under antiretroviral therapy (ART) and we have recently found that
the viral reservoir seeded after infection does not depend on the classical cytolytic function of antigen-specific
CD8+ T cells. The hypothesis to be tested in Project 2 is that the CD8+ T cell-mediated HIV/SIV pro-latency
effect will be reproducible in pediatric models; however, distinct features of this non-classical role for CD8+ T
cells may be influenced by the regulatory immune environment in early life. In Aim 1, we will develop pediatric
in vitro models to thoroughly investigate the mechanisms involved in CD8+ T cell-mediated control of HIV/SIV
latency in infants and children via comparative immunophenotyping, transcriptomic, and virological analyses in
presence or absence of CD8+ T cells. In Aim 2, we will conduct a proof-of-principle in vivo study using
experimental antibody mediated CD8+ cell depletion in rhesus macaque (RM) infants prior to infection with
SIVmac239M. To assess the role of CD8+ T cells in SIV reservoir establishment we will compare viral dynamics
and viral reservoir size/diversity/integration sites on ART and virus rebound after ART interruption between
CD8-depleted and undepleted RM infants. In Aim 3, antibody-mediated CD8+ cell depletion will be performed
in SIVmac239M-infected RM infants after long-term ART with and without an LRA to test the extent to which
removal of CD8+ T cells disrupts reservoir maintenance. CD8+ T cell-mediated mechanisms involved in latency
reversal will be further assessed through multiomic analyses. A better understanding of the vulnerability of HIV
reservoirs to innate and adaptive immune pressure will drive informed approaches to a cure for CLWH. The
research proposed builds on our expertise with infant RM models, state-of-the-art reservoir assays, and T cell
immunology to deeply interrogate pediatric HIV/SIV. With multidisciplinary approaches, synergies across
Projects and Cores, and our highly collaborative group of established and early-stage investigators, we are
confident that Project 2 will lead to important discoveries regarding immune regulation of the pediatric HIV
reservoir and immune dysfunction. It is our mission to turn these discoveries into clinical trial protocols to
advance research towards a cure for children with HIV."
10814304,"ABSTRACT – Project 3
The overall objective of this Program project application is to generate a comprehensive understanding of the
complex host-pathogen interactions critical for HIV reservoir seeding and persistence such that novel cure
strategies truly targeted for the unique immune environment of children living with HIV (CLWH) can be created.
The knowledge gap we address in Project 3 is how the establishment and maintenance of HIV reservoirs are
regulated by the neonatal and childhood immune system, with specific focus on host and bacterial metabolites,
immunoregulatory cytokines, and thymic output. HIV persistence in adults is driven by recognizable
metabolomic and microbial profiles that include metabolites modulating epigenetic changes in genes regulating
innate/adaptive immune cell function and HIV latency. Studies in CLWH clearly demonstrate that the size of
the HIV reservoir is variable with a high dynamic range. The hypothesis to be tested in Project 3 is that age-
associated changes in HIV reservoir size and stability are driven by specific metabolites that influence CD4+
and CD8+ T cell function, cytokine production (e.g., IL-10 and TGF-β), and the level of HIV-infected recent
thymic emigrants (RTEs). In Aim 1, we will quantify the contribution of thymic output and infected RTEs to
changes in the size of the intact HIV reservoir. We will test the impact of the anti-inflammatory cytokine
environment prevalent in younger age groups on thymic output and HIV reservoir seeding. In Aim 2, we will
address how innate and adaptive cellular immune homeostasis and HIV-specific immune function are
influenced by the host environment and thymic output using high-dimensional flow cytometry, cytokine
analyses and transcriptional/epigenetic profiling on single cells. In Aim 3, we will decipher the impact of
microbial/host metabolites on production of IL-10 and TGF-β, establishment and maintenance of HIV
reservoirs, and innate/adaptive immune functions. Targeted metabolomics to quantify short chain fatty acids
and primary/secondary bile acids will be used to define and validate relationships with levels of intact and
translation competent HIV DNA. Finally, immunological, virological, and molecular data will be integrated, and
machine learning algorithms will be used to develop models to predict the magnitude and features of HIV
reservoirs. Longitudinal samples from two cohorts of CLWH (IMPAACT biorepository and EPIC4 study) allow
us to monitor dynamics of HIV reservoirs across childhood. A better understanding of the vulnerability of HIV
reservoirs to innate and adaptive immune pressure will drive informed approaches to a cure for CLWH. The
research proposed builds on our expertise with cutting-edge systems immunology to deeply interrogate HIV.
With multidisciplinary approaches, synergies across Projects and Cores, and our highly collaborative group of
established and early-stage investigators, we are confident that Project 3 will lead to important discoveries
regarding immune regulation of the pediatric HIV reservoir and immune dysfunction. It is our mission to turn
these discoveries into clinical trial protocols to advance research towards a cure for children with HIV."
10857306,"Project Summary/Abstract (Overall Component, RFA-CA-22-040)
 We propose to develop a blood-based test whose indicated use is to complement mammography in the early
detection of breast cancers. Although mammography saves lives through early detection, it is imperfect.
Approximately one in seven breast cancers goes undetected despite screening mammography, and interval
cancers that manifest within a year of a normal mammogram remain a vexing problem, especially (although not
exclusively) for the >27 million women in the United States with heterogeneously or extremely dense breasts at
high risk for interval cancers. We propose to develop a blood test that could be used as an adjunct to
mammography to improve early detection by improving sensitivity and/or specificity of mammography. Using a
novel biomarker discovery approach leveraging human-in-mouse breast cancer patient-derived xenograft
models and state-of-the-art mass spectrometry methods, we prioritized 162 candidate breast cancer protein
biomarkers for validation studies.
 Our BCC will perform EDRN Phase 2 biomarker validation studies of our prioritized 162 candidate plasma
protein biomarkers of breast cancer. We have an experienced multidisciplinary team (including two junior
investigators) with a strong track record of productive collaboration and representing expertise in clinical
oncology, cancer biomarkers, pathology, CLIA/CAP/GLP assays, epidemiology, radiology/breast imaging,
cancer screening, ‘omics data generation, and biostatistics. Our team includes 2 industry partners, encompasses
3 CLIA laboratories, and can provide expertise and access to multiple quantitative platforms in a CLIA/CAP/GLP
environment to support EDRN Network Collaborations for biomarker validation studies with other BCCs.
 The Biomarker Development Laboratory will contribute to the biomarker validation studies by: (i) developing
qualified reagents & methods for quantifying 162 candidate protein biomarkers, (ii) procuring plasma
biospecimens (compliant with EDRN PRoBE study design) for phase 2 biomarker validation studies, (iii)
delivering plasma aliquots to our BRL CLIA labs in a blinded fashion, and (iv) analyzing EDRN phase 2 validation
data generated by the BRL, providing statistical, epidemiological, and breast imaging expertise to set and
evaluate performance metrics to ensure biomarkers are adequate to provide clinical utility for early detection.
 The Biomarker Reference Laboratory will contribute to the proposed validation studies by: (i) validating a CLIA-
compliant standard operating procedure for an immuno-MRM assay to quantify up to 162 candidate protein
biomarkers of early-stage breast cancer that will serve as the basis for our biomarker validation studies, (ii)
performing phase 2 biomarker validation studies, and (iii) providing reference laboratory support for the EDRN
network (e.g., mass spectrometric analyses, flow cytometry, NextGen sequencing and ELISA assays.
 The Administrative Core will support all aspects of the BCC, including managing all administrative and project
management aspects of the BCC as well as managing all center logistics and communication."
10917122,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Most children treated for cancer in the US will achieve long-term survival, and survivorship presents unique
challenges for this growing population. Pediatric brain tumor survivors, in particular, are at risk for
neurocognitive impairments, educational difficulties, social problems, and medical disabilities. Cranial radiation
therapy is an essential lifesaving treatment but is associated with cognitive decline. Proton beam radiation
therapy (PBRT) is one of the most promising recent advances in pediatric brain tumor treatment. The proposed
medical advantage of PBRT lies in the precision of radiation delivery with proton beams, depositing maximum
dose to clinical targets while minimizing radiation to surrounding tissues. By reducing dose to healthy brain
tissue, PBRT may spare cognitive functioning and reduce symptom burden better than conventional photon or
x-ray irradiation (XRT) leading to greater functional independence in survivorship.
 Using a model-based, accelerated longitudinal cohort comparison design, we will compare symptom
burden/toxicity, neurocognitive change, and functional outcomes at multiple data points from start of radiation
through late survivorship in patients treated with PBRT versus XRT. The following aims are proposed: (1) to
compare symptom burden and toxicity by RT type in pediatric brain tumor patients and survivors, (2) to
compare change in neurocognitive outcomes over time by RT type, (3) to compare functional outcomes in
early and late survivorship by RT type, and (4) to examine relations among symptom burden/toxicity,
neurocognitive function, and functional outcomes as a function of RT type.
 This proposal is consistent with NCI’s objective to “reduce the long-term adverse effects of cancer and its
treatment” in children and to “improve the quality of life for cancer patients, survivors, and their families.”
Neurocognitive late effects lead to significant educational, social, and occupational limitations for many
survivors, greatly affecting their quality of life and functional independence long-term. Research is needed to
determine which treatments are best able to limit the suffering associated with symptom burden and post-
treatment neurocognitive decline. Our results will have clinical value, providing a timely comparison of
symptoms, neurocognitive changes, and functional outcomes between PBRT and XRT groups that will guide
clinicians and families on the range of outcomes to expect after PBRT."

10873165,"Project Summary / Abstract
As colorectal cancer (CRC) remains one of the leading causes of cancer death new approaches are of vital
importance to make critical inroads in reducing the burden of this lethal disease. Precision medicine holds
enormous promise as advances in genomic research that were previously unimaginable now offer vast
commercial potential and are rapidly being moved into clinical practice, even though critical questions remain to
be addressed. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) that aggregate common genetic risk variants into a single score to
predict disease are a key example. Broad accessibility, plummeting genotyping costs, and the need to account
for the patient's individual risk profile to improve screening have provided transformative opportunities in
personalized prevention. However, wide-scale clinical adoption of PRS raises key ethical and scientific
challenges. Arguably one of the most critical challenge is the fact that current PRS are substantially more
effective in predicting risk in individuals of European ancestry compared with other populations due to the Euro-
centric bias in genetic research. Accordingly, we need to develop an unbiased PRS that predicts CRC risk in all
major racial/ethnic groups. However, this is only the first step towards implementation, which also requires the
evaluation of the optimal risk-stratified screening approach and development of risk communication tool among
others. To address these needs, we will develop and validate an unbiased PRS for CRC across ethnic/racial
minority groups to inform risk-stratified CRC screening (Aim 1a). We will augment the PRS with an environmental/
lifestyle risk score (ERS) to account for other risk factors (Aim 1b) and examine differential effects by age of
onset (Aim 1c), given the alarming increase of early onset CRC. In Aim 2a we will determine the optimal CRC
screening strategy given an individual's risk defined in Aim 1 using our microsimulation modeling by incorporating
differences in CRC incidence and mortality rates by age, sex and race/ethnicity, and in risk factor distributions
across racial/ethnic groups. In Aim 2b we will evaluate the cost-effectiveness of risk stratified screening
compared with current screening guidelines. Finally, we will develop a risk communication tool (Aim 3a) and
investigate potential dissemination issues of risk-stratified CRC screening across ethnic/racial minority groups
(Aim 3b). Our trans-disciplinary research team, which includes a community advisory board, is uniquely set up
to address these critical questions as we 1) have brought together all known racially/ethnically diverse CRC
studies totaling to over 120,000 CRC cases and controls, 2) have strong expertise in developing comprehensive
genetic and environmental risk scores in racially/ethnically diverse populations, 3) lead one of the most
comprehensive decision models for cost-effectiveness analysis which has consistently been used to inform US
screening guidelines and 4) have expertise in implementation science for genetic research in minorities.
Addressing all aims is critical to avoid a sequential science in this rapidly moving field of precision medicine."

 This is an application for renewal of grant T32CA009110-42 to support the training of predoctoral students
and postdoctoral fellows in the conduct of research aimed at understanding the fundamental biochemical,
molecular and cellular processes underlying the development and progression of cancer. During the next funding
period, we are requesting continued support for 7 predoctoral and 3 postdoctoral trainees per year. The
administration of this program is centered in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology in the Johns
Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health. However, training faculty associated with the program
represent 13 different departments across the Bloomberg School of Public Health and the Johns Hopkins
University School of Medicine, and include faculty affiliated with the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer
Center (SKCCC). The addition of more than 25 new training faculty to the program over the past several years,
including 14 new additions with this renewal application, dramatically expands the opportunities available for
trainees to receive mentoring and training in productive, well-funded laboratories performing cutting edge cancer
research. Major research themes explored by training faculty affiliated with the program span a broad spectrum
of cancer biology including the tumor microenvironment, cell migration and metastasis, post-transcriptional and
epigenetic regulation of gene expression, and regulation of genome integrity. In addition to laboratory research,
all trainees are required to participate in cancer training courses offered by the SKCCC, as well as a cancer-
focused seminar series, journal club and monthly research colloquium, all designed to build core knowledge,
effective reasoning, and communication skills. Additionally, and as one of the unique aspects of this training
program, trainees receive instruction in the public health aspects of cancer research, in areas such as cancer
prevention and control, cancer epidemiology, and advocacy and awareness. Predoctoral students are admitted
to the program after demonstrating strong academic abilities and laboratory research potential during their first
year of training. Postdoctoral trainees showing strong substantiated interests in cancer research are selected
through a competitive review of applications. In this renewal application we aim to strengthen our commitment
to providing outstanding training through proposed changes to the curriculum that include enhanced training in
rigor, reproducibility and experimental design, quantitative sciences and biostatistics, and career planning. We
will also introduce formal training for faculty to develop mentoring skills and strengthen existing efforts to promote
diversity and inclusion. The program has a long history of attracting talented young trainees who remain active
in science and develop distinguished careers in cancer research. We aim to continue this tradition by equipping
trainees with the essential knowledge and skills needed for careers in cancer research, with a unique focus on
how this can both inform and be informed by public health practices."

cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a heritable cause of heart failure and the leading indication for heart transplantation
worldwide. While studies regarding the genetic causes of DCM have focused on rare, large-effect
(“monogenic”) mutations, these account for < 40% of DCM cases referred for genetic testing. The PI will
leverage multiple large databases (Total N > 1,000,000) with robust phenotypic and genotypic data to identify
common, small-effect genetic variants associated with DCM which, in aggregate, contribute to a “polygenic”
susceptibility to disease. First, the PI will conduct EHR-based phenotyping to permit a common variant
association study and meta-analysis of DCM, and then derive a DCM polygenic risk score. Second, he will
assess the longitudinal risk associated with established, monogenic DCM mutations in a population-based
cohort, and perform rare variant association analyses with clinical and subclinical DCM. Third, he will
determine how rare, monogenic mutations interact with polygenic risk, and non-genetic factors (including
clinical, lifestyle and environmental factors) to influence disease penetrance. Successful completion of the
proposed studies will yield a comprehensive assessment of the polygenic basis of DCM and the relative,
population-wide contributions of monogenic and polygenic risk to disease pathogenesis. Finally, completion of
this proposal will allow the PI to acquire new skills in several important domains (clinical informatics, advanced
statistical genetics, NGS analyses, computational biology, cloud computing, and trans-omics investigation) that
will facilitate his transition to a role as an independent physician-scientist."

While environmental entities instigate T1D development, their identity is unknown. Genetics greatly increases
risk, but the discordance between identical twins proves an equally critical role for exogenous factors. To identify
causal entities, sampling must occur before clinical disease develops. Although labor intensive and costly,
prospective longitudinal testing is the only way to illuminate the mysterious events that precede disease. Results
from our recent collaboration with the TrialNet Pathway to Prevention study point to a role for CMV
infection in T1D development. We found a striking expansion of terminally-differentiated short lived effector
CD8 T cells (SLEC) in seroconverted (AA+) at-risk subjects. The frequencies of SLEC are highest in
seroconverted subjects that progress to disease. This SLEC subset is identical to the well-characterized
CD8 response to CMV. Importantly, we found the SLEC expansion is strongly associated with CMV
seropositivity. Our findings demonstrate that an expanded, exhausted antiviral response occurs one
year before autoimmune T1D develops. We also determined that SLEC levels correlate strongly with IA-2
autoantibodies, demonstrating a connection between CMV and autoimmunity. T1D results from autoreactive
CD8 T cell-mediated attack on pancreatic islets. These autoreactive T cells may arise as a byproduct of the anti-
viral response. Our overarching hypothesis is that CMV is an important environmental factor accelerating T1D
development in children with genetic risk. The objective of this application is to longitudinally probe the
preclinical disease process and unravel the mechanisms connecting CMV and T1D. In Aim 1 we propose
to derive kinetic measurements through a longitudinal study. We hypothesize that genetically susceptible
pre-T1D children show increased levels of exhausted CD8 T cells prior to the development of
autoantibodies and/or clinical autoimmunity. In aim 2 we will measure CMV replication and persistence in at
risk subjects that develop autoimmunity. We hypothesize that the accumulation of exhausted CD8 T cells
causes viral persistence. In aim 3 we will test mechanisms whereby the virus activates islet specific CD8 T
cells. We hypothesize that CMV infection induces the expansion of islet antigen-specific CD8 T cells. An
established connection between CMV replication and T1D will point to antiviral therapies as efficacious in
subjects with high genetic risk. Furthermore, levels of CMV replication and SLEC represent interlocking
biomarkers for stratifying subjects for antiviral and/or vaccine trials. Several CMV vaccines are currently being
tested in the clinic. Our results will also facilitate the understanding of other CMV-related human diseases."
10689165,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Epidemic Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) is an HIV-1 associated tumor, and remains one of the highest incidence
neoplasms in sub-Saharan African men and women despite effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) programs.
The fundamental mechanism driving KS appears to be KSHV infection, but it is clear that KSHV infection alone
is insufficient for KS development since most infected individuals do not develop KS. HIV-1 co-infection or
therapeutic immune suppression induces, exacerbates, or accelerates KS disease. How HIV-1 co-infection
synergizes with KSHV to form or maintain the tumor niche is largely unexplored in tissue.
In many cancers, a clear understanding of the tumor microenvironment including the presence, antigen-
specificity and functionality of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) is revolutionizing therapeutic approaches.
Yet for KS we have a dearth of information about the nature of TILs and whether the tumor microenvironment
is suppressing their anti-neoplastic function in an HIV-1 dependent manner. This project seeks to rectify this
knowledge gap in a Case (HIV-1+/KS+) versus Control ((HIV-1+/KS-) design by comparatively investigating
the phenotypes and the functionality of TILs in comparison to the same cells in the peripheral immune system
and by comparing the tumor and peripheral immune cell expression patterns.
Our hypothesis is that even in the face of a detectable KSHV-reactive peripheral T cell response and effective
HIV-1 suppression, there are insufficient numbers of KSHV Ag-specifc tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TILs)
and these cells are non-responsive to antigen in KS tumors. Our approach is 1) to functionally compare the
peripheral CD4 and CD8 T cell responses to KSHV and ubiquitous immunodominant antigens in KS with
differential HIV-1 disease duration; 2) to isolate, and immunophenotypically and functionally characterize KS
tumor infiltrating leukocytes; and 3) to compare the transcriptomes of TILs with autologous peripheral cells or
those from KS asymptomatic controls.
From these comparative investigations, we anticipate deriving a more robust understanding of the expression
programs and immune responsiveness of adaptive immune cells in the KS tumor niche and more complete
understanding of the role of HIV-1, immune suppression, anergy, exhaustion, and senescence in defining that
niche. This understanding will direct interventional strategies including the design of immunotherapeutics and
potentially vaccines against KS."

 Our long-term goal is to employ innovative community based participatory research to establish a
community advisory board, to collaborate with our community partners to recruit, enroll, and retain a cohort of
Black participants and, then, to examine causal mechanisms that increase the risk of Alzheimer disease (AD)
within the community cohort. The long preclinical stage of AD, as reflected in biomarkers among adults, is a
key risk factor of symptomatic AD. However, despite Blacks having a higher risk of developing AD, recent
studies suggest that they have less abnormal levels of biomarkers than Whites in cognitively normal samples.
This study aims to examine other risk factors of cognitive decline and AD such as depression, stress, and
social determinants of health (SDOH) in a representative sample of Black participants.
 This research is significant because there are nearly 46 million Black Americans, comprising 13% of the
population in the United States. The Black older adult population is expected to increase, from 4.4 million older
adults in 2016 to 12.1 million by 2060. Despite these demographic projections, Blacks are significantly
underrepresented in AD research. An almost exclusive focus on Whites has created a knowledge gap in
understanding how SDOH mechanisms affect diverse populations. Closing this knowledge gap soon is critical
since epidemiological studies suggest that Blacks are at twice the risk of AD compared to Whites.
 Our Specific Aims will (1) Establish a cohort of middle-to-older age Black adults (N=300) using community-
based participatory research to understand the unique social, environmental, and economic barriers related to
AD risk, (2) Determine the impact of depression, stress, and a novel, theory-based SDOH composite index (CI)
on cognitive functioning in participants who are cognitively normal with and without preclinical AD, and (3) Test
the association between white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and hippocampal volume (HV) with the SDOH-CI
in a subset of participants (N=150) with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data.
 To test our Aims, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team with expertise in AD, SDOH, community-
based participatory research and system dynamics, community mobilization, stress and depression, plasma
biomarkers, genetics, neuroimaging, neuropsychology, and biostatistical methods. Participants will undergo a
one-time blood draw for AD biomarker profiling, cognitive assessment using a neuropsychological battery, and
participate in one MRI scan session. Participants will also participate in workshops, complete a comprehensive
battery of SDOH measures mapped onto the National Institute of Aging’s Health Research Disparities
Framework, and clinical, neurological, and neuropsychological tests annually for up to five years.
 Once obtained, this knowledge of how within-group heterogeneity in cognitive functioning and AD risk is
impacted by SDOH may better support effective AD intervention and treatment for Black Americans."

Positron emission tomography (PET) is unrivaled as a highly specific and sensitive means for tomographic
imaging of molecular interactions and pathways in humans, offering great utility for translational medicine.
Recently, long axial field-of-view PET scanners, which provide excellent geometric coverage, giving much better
detection sensitivity, have been developed. However, cost and performance issues are raised as concerns. To
resolve both cost and performance issues, next generation long axial field-of-view PET detector modules should
employ new scintillators to realize the full performance capabilities of PET at a viable price point.
 A proposed ceramic scintillator has extremely high stopping power and density, better than any currently used
scintillator for PET. The proposed scintillator has a high light yield and an excellent energy resolution. Moreover,
we achieved a very good coincidence timing resolution. In addition, it has a cubic crystal structure allowing
fabrication by ceramic processing, with potential for a major reduction in cost compared with L(Y)SO.
 This proposal is 1) to develop the new ceramic scintillator for PET with large volumes and high clarity, 2) to
characterize the new scintillator as a PET scintillator, 3) to apply the new scintillator array blocks into well-
designed existing PET detector modules to evaluate performance of the new scintillator at the module level, and
finally 4) to develop novel time-of-flight (TOF)-PET detector modules by combining the new ceramic scintillator
and advanced PET readout methods for next-generation PET scanners.
 The proposed ceramic scintillator and PET detector modules are not limited to long axial field-of-view PET
scanners and will be widely usable. The impact of this proposal is that it provides a pathway to 1) realizing long
axial field-of-view scanners with unprecedented sensitivity without a proportional increase in scanner cost and
2) enabling performance advantages in shorter scintillators in terms of reducing DOI effect and improving timing
and energy resolution without losing detection efficiency for next-generation TOF-PET scanners."

13 Master’s and PhD students and achieving a robust publications record. However, our updated needs
assessment has indicated that better career support, increased mentoring and more outreach to historically
disadvantaged institutions is needed to achieve our overarching goal of creating sustainable centers of
excellence in HIV-related transfusion medicine and hematology research enterprise in South Africa. For this
renewal, we propose these Specific Aims: 1) Train the next generation of clinical researchers in HIV hematology
and transfusion medicine to become independent researchers who will address emerging health challenges in
these areas; 2) Strengthen institutional research capacity in applied HIV research at the SANBS Research and
Development Academy and clinical and translational HIV research at the UCT Haematology Division; and 3)
Develop a South African center of excellence in HIV hematology and transfusion medicine that will reach out to
historically disadvantaged institutions and address inequities in research opportunity. We plan a four-tiered
educational approach for trainees at various levels: in-country short courses on clinical research methodology,
protocol design and manuscript preparation will reach a large number of trainees; for a smaller number lacking
skills in study design, biostatistics and data analysis we propose medium-term course work in Cape Town and
San Francisco; for the most promising, Master’s and PhD degree enrollment at the UCT School of Health
Sciences; and for graduates of the program, a new early-stage investigator tier providing career mentorship and
grantsmanship training. All trainees will be mentored as they accomplish research projects, compete for mini-
grants funded by the program and publish manuscripts. Research resources include the HIV lymphoma registry
and clinical resources at UCT, archived data and specimens from the REDS-III HIV research network and real-
time HIV testing data from blood centers. High impact research topics include: HIV lymphoma biology, clinical
course and treatment; HIV-related anemias and malignancies; HIV prevalence and incidence using novel lab

10902103,"Short gut syndrome (SGS) results from the treatment of multiple conditions in adults and children. In children, the mortality associated with SGS is roughly 25%, making it one of the most lethal conditions in infancy and childhood. Morbidity among survivors is high with another 25% of children requiring a small bowel transplant. The current 5-year patient survival following a small bowel transplant is still roughly 58%. Intestinal failure associated liver disease (IFALD) represents a spectrum of liver injury including steatosis, cholestasis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis. IFALD is the leading indication for intestinal and/or multivisceral transplantation in children with SGS. The incidence of IFALD is roughly 50% in pediatric patients who receive parenteral nutrition (PN). The pathogenesis of IFALD is unique because SGS patients are enterally starved, have no insulin resistance, and are not obese. Using a PN-independent murine model of small bowel resection (SBR), we demonstrate perturbed gut barrier function and significant alterations in intestinal lipid signaling, severe hepatitis, cholestasis, necrosis, and regenerative nodules. In one mouse, we confirmed the development of HCC. Accordingly, our overarching hypothesis is that IFALD reflects a proinflammatory milieu within the remnant bowel along with profound alterations in lipid signaling within both intestine and liver to initiate hepatic injury, fibrosis, and ultimate progression to advanced liver injury. For this project, we have developed a multiple-PI proposal embracing world class expertise in intestinal adaptation responses to massive SBR (Warner/Rubin), intestinal and hepatic lipid signaling (Davidson) and genomics and metabolomics (Ding). In the first Specific Aim, we will focus on the intestinal contribution to liver injury and fibrosis. First, genetically altered mice will undergo SBR to determine the effect of impaired intestinal chylomicron assembly, disrupted intestinal expression of a major transcription factor involved with lipid sensing and signaling, and perturbed expression of an enterocyte cytoplasmic protein involved with absorption of long chain fatty acids on liver injury. We will then delineate the effects of varied dietary fat on liver injury, intestinal permeability, and portal venous cytokine production. Finally, we will determine the most important intestinal site of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activity in the pathogenesis of altered gut permeability and resection-associated liver injury. The next Specific Aim will focus on the hepatic component of injury, steatosis, and fibrosis after SBR. We will delineate a temporal profile of lipidomic and lipogenic gene expression within the liver at multiple time points after SBR. We will determine whether alteration of the omega-6 to omega-3 ratio as well as disrupted expression of a major regulator of lipid synthesis contributes to advanced liver injury. Finally, we will elucidate a genomic and metabolomic profile in the liver of evolving liver injury in mice as well as in human patients with end stage IFALD. These findings may provide novel mechanistic insight into the etiology of IFALD."
10799700,"ABSTRACT. With enhanced access to antiretroviral therapy, a higher prevalence of risk factors (e.g., tobacco
use) for noncommunicable diseases (NCD) and direct effects of HIV infection, the burden of NCD-related
morbidity and mortality among PWH is growing in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), including
Vietnam. This increase presents a significant threat to the progress achieved in reducing global mortality
attributable to HIV in LMICs. Despite strong evidence for WHO-endorsed interventions that can prevent and
effectively treat NCDs, implementation of NCD-related evidence-based interventions (EBI) in HIV care has
lagged. There is an opportunity to leverage the substantial investments in HIV health systems in Vietnam to
deliver NCD-related EBIs. Achieving this goal will require building capacity to conduct research that can
generate actionable data to inform implementation and scale-up of EBIs in the context of HIV care.
Implementation Science (IS) provides a set of methods that can accelerate the translation of research into
policy and practice to improve population health outcomes. This application builds on well-established
relationships between the PIs in at New York University’s School of Global Public Health and Vietnam’s Hanoi
University of Public Health (HUPH), forged through over a decade of collaboration on NIH-funded
implementation research. The “Advancing Implementation Research Capacity in Vietnam” (ARC) training
program will establish a sustainable HUPH Implementation Science Program that will offer didactic training and
practical research experiences with established HIV/AIDS, NCD and IS investigators to prepare individuals
from diverse professional backgrounds to contribute to implementation research teams. Our aims are to: (1)
Provide training to 48 graduate students, early career research faculty, policymakers and health care system
leaders that equips trainees with implementation research methods skills and knowledge through coursework,
mentoring, and experiential learning in global health implementation science. We will also enroll trainees from
the University of Health Sciences in Laos to build the foundation for regional IS collaboration. (2) Build a
network of multidisciplinary mentors from the global north and south to promote equitable bi-directional
learning and collaboration, and implement a culturally-informed mentor training program to optimize mentor
and mentee relationships and enhance career advancement for promising investigators and public health
professionals committed to reversing the growing burden of NCD-related health disparities among PWH. (3)
Evaluate multilevel short-and long-term outcomes and explore factors that can inform effective mentorship and
training. The project aims to institutionalize model curriculum for IS training focused on priorities relevant to
advancing health outcomes among PWH at a leading institution in Vietnam. Engaging both academia, public
health professionals and policymakers in IS training enhances the potential for immediate and future
translation of EBIs into policies and practices system wide to reduce the burden of NCDs among PWH."
10807044,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The nation of Zambia has a generalized HIV epidemic with adult prevalence of 11.0%, but now stands on cusp
of reaching HIV epidemic control. As the HIV epidemic evolves, Zambia needs to develop local implementation
science capacity to address key and vulnerable populations for the last mile epidemic control. To train this
cadre of implementation scientists, we propose the Zambia Education Network for Implementation Science
Training in Health (ZENITH), a partnership between University Teaching Hospital, the premier medical training
site in Zambia, and the University of Maryland Baltimore (UMB), an implementation partner with nearly 20
years of HIV capacity building and medical/technical assistance in Zambia.
The goal of ZENITH is to develop Zambian short, medium, and long-term implementation science capacity at
UTH to address the unmet need of key and vulnerable populations towards attaining sustainable epidemic
control.
 Aim1 : We will build short-term, immediate research capacity by having 25 students (5 per year)
 participate in a new Implementation Science Institute (ISI) in Lusaka to learn basic approaches to
 implementation science research, including methods, biostatistics, qualitative methods, and introduction
 to grant & manuscript writing. This will be a one-month intensive course taught at UTH in January.
 Aim 2: We will build medium-term research capacity by supporting 8 students (2 per year) via the two-
 year Master in Health Sciences (MHS) in Implementation & Dissemination Science at UMB. Virtual
 courses done online in Zambia.
 Aim 3: We will build long-term independent research capacity by supporting 2 students for PhD studies at
UMB, including Epidemiology at UMB Graduate School, and qualitative social science. It is expected that
PhD mentees will take over the ISI by end of the project.
All trainees will be supported by one-on-one mentor meetings, using a twinned mentor model whereby senior
and junior mentors co-supervise the mentee, which will also build mentorship capacity in local junior mentors.
Building on Zambia's deep experience with using ECHO platform to build clinical capacity in HIV, ZENITH
students will participate in a monthly research ECHO seminar to share research progress, journal clubs, and
mentorship."

This application seeks to renew our D43 HIV research training grant by building on longstanding Kenyatta
National Hospital (KNH) collaborations with University of Washington (UW) and our first 10 years of successful
training under the grant titled, “Improving the HIV Care Cascade in Kenya through Implementation Science
Training”. From September 2013 to the present, the program has focused on increasing research capacity at
KNH, the largest teaching and referral hospital in Kenya, and at the Kenya Ministry of Health (MOH) to improve
HIV testing, linkage to care, antiretroviral initiation and viral suppression, a continuum known as the HIV care
cascade. With evolution of the HIV epidemic in Kenya, we are shifting focus to preventing and treating non-
communicable diseases (NCDs), including cardiovascular and metabolic disease, chronic lung disease, mental
health problems, and cancer among people living with HIV (PLWH), to enable PLWH to live longer and healthier
lives. During the last two grant periods, 18 KNH Care Cascade (KNHCC) trainees have earned MPH or PhD
degrees and this provides a solid foundation for KNH and our partners at MOH to continue providing critical
support for the training, teaching, and research activities needed to realize this vision. The renewal application
will be based at KNH and led by Dr. John Kinuthia, Head of the Department of Research and Programs at KNH,
and co-led by Dr. Carey Farquhar, Interim Chair of the Department of Global Health at UW. A majority of the
training will take place in Kenya and KNH will be the prime awardee. Titled “Integrating prevention and treatment
of non-communicable diseases and HIV care through research training in Kenya-INTEGRATE,” the program will
offer long-term training through an MPH/PhD program in implementation science and epidemiology which
includes PhD training at University of Nairobi (UoN) (3 years) and MPH training in Seattle (1 year). The program
will also offer a 1-year mentored post-doctoral fellowship in Kenya to bridge PhD trainees as they develop
proposals for independent research and career development awards. We will also offer short-term in-person and
online training in Kenya, teaching 1 to 2-week courses on implementation science and other research methods
that have been taught successfully at KNH over the last decade. We will leverage the UW Department of Global
Health’s e-learning platform (eDGH) to reach large numbers of KNH and MOH professional staff. Short-course
trainings will build broader institutional capacity and identify the best candidates for future degree and post-
doctoral training. A Steering Committee comprised of leading researchers, educators, and public health
professionals from all 4 institutions (KNH, UoN, UW, and MOH) will work closely with the Program Director and
Co-director and receive regular input from an external Training Advisory Committee (TAC) to ensure success of
each trainee and the overall program. This success will translate into producing high-quality and locally relevant
research, training the next generation of Kenyan researchers, and influencing national guidelines and policies to
prevent and treat NCDs among PLWH."
10922711,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is a powerful tool that can measure population health in
communities with centralized sewer treatment systems and is particularly relevant for Tribes who wish
to assess health disparities such as COVID and substance abuse. In WBE, chemical metabolites,
bacteria and viruses, and other health indicators are measured in excreted human waste products in
wastewater. The wastewater flow rate and population load into the sewershed allow for calculation of
community-level human health indicators present in water. WBE has not been documented in Tribal
communities prior to the PI’s efforts, and there are knowledge gaps related to the execution,
acceptability, and applicability of this tool to assess Tribal population health. Our specific aims are to
(1) develop a framework for conducting responsible WBE research and surveillance in Tribal
communities, which will address data sovereignty, Tribal sewer infrastructure and personnel, and
handling of environmental biospecimens; (2) assess the perceptions of using WBE by Tribal leaders,
health administrators, and community members through surveys; and (3) determine and quantify
relevant health metrics that can be measured by WBE, including infectious disease, pollutant
exposure, the gut microbiome, and substance abuse. This faculty enhancement award under ITCA’s
NARCH XI will provide directed mentorship and training to the PI from ITCA staff. This collaborative
project will develop research capacity for ITCA, partner Tribes in Arizona and the faculty member
through collection of preliminary data, leading to development of larger projects with ITCA and the
partner intertribal consortia for future WBE studies."
10828919,"Project Summary
Respiratory infections are the most common reason for doctor visits and the third leading cause
of deaths. Viruses are the causative agents of most respiratory tract infections. Knowledge of
the transmission modes for pathogenic respiratory viruses is critical for improving mitigation
strategies that safeguard public health, but understanding their transmission mechanisms is
hampered by existing sampling methods. So far, no method has been recommended by the
public health organizations for the collection and detection of airborne viruses. The lack of
standard protocols results from the fact that no sampling procedure is appropriate for sampling
of all bioaerosols. During sampling, it is necessary to minimize inactivation of microbes, such as
incapacitating desiccation and destructive impaction upon collection onto a collection surface.
When collecting samples for detection of viral genomic RNA or DNA, maintaining the viability of
the virus is not necessary, but maintaining nucleic acid integrity is essential, especially for RNA,
which is rapidly degraded upon exposure to the environment. For assessing infectivity, the
pathogen needs to be viable. In both cases, gentle collection methods are required.
 Although previous efforts have tried to separate virus-containing particles by aerodynamic
size, maintaining their infectivity during sampling remains challenging. Here, we aim to develop
a novel sampling system, the BioCascade, that will allow the collection of airborne viruses within
four different bioaerosol particle size-fractions: >10 um, PM4-10, PM1.5-4 and PM1.5 into liquid
medium, while maintaining infectivity of the viruses that are collected. In Phase I, we built a
BioCascade prototype. Its particle size-range cut-off and the collection efficiency of each stage
were modeled and designed by numerical simulations followed by validation through laboratory
experiments using National Institutes of Science and Technology (NIST)-certified standard-
sized particles. Its ability to collect and maintain the infectivity of bioaerosol was then assessed
using microorganisms that were representative of the size ranges that would be encountered in
bioaerosols. All Phase-I aims were successfully achieved. In Phase II, we aim to improve our
prototype by expanding its capabilities, such as a cold collection chamber for providing a better
environment for the collected pathogens, and a control system to maintain the liquid level that
enables increased sampling time to several hours. By providing size-fractionated air samples
that contain infectious pathogens, the Biocascade is envisioned as a powerful tool, not available
before, that can transform our current disease-control paradigm from a reactive approach (to an
outbreak after its fact) to a proactive approach (inform us the forthcoming viruses)."
10864953,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a common and burdensome neurodegenerative disease. Apolipoprotein E
(APOE) is the most prevalent risk factor for developing AD. APOE genotype may contribute to disease
pathogenesis and risk by impacting astrocyte molecular profiles and subsequent biological functions. Data from
my lab in human post-mortem AD and control brain proteomes identified a module of co-expressed astrocytic
and microglial proteins in APOE ε4 individuals that were involved in sugar metabolism and inflammation and
strongly correlated with the MAPK/ERK pathway. Because astrocytes are abundant throughout the brain,
produce high levels of apoE protein, and play a critical role in brain homeostasis, they are more likely to contribute
to disease vulnerability and pathogenesis of AD in the context of APOE risk. To address how APOE genotype
impacts astrocyte function, my laboratory recently developed cell type-specific in vivo biotinylation of proteins
(CIBOP) as a novel approach to quantify the total and phospho-proteomes of astrocytes in their native state
without the need for cell isolation. In this approach, the biotin ligase, TurboID, is selectively expressed in the cell
type of interest using a conditional Cre/lox genetic strategy. Using astrocyte-CIBOP in our preliminary studies,
we have successfully obtained native-state proteomes of astrocytes from mouse brain, and quantified astrocyte-
derived cytokines and MAPK/ERK signaling phospho-proteins. Leveraging this highly innovative methodology,
my goal in the current study is to for the first time define the astrocyte-like immune response to APOE ε4 genotype
and determine if the MAPK/ERK pathway is a mechanism of this response. My central hypothesis is that APOE
ε4 genotype augments pro-inflammatory profiles of astrocytes via increased cytokine and complement
production in an ERK signaling-dependent manner. I will use the astrocyte-CIBOP mice derived on homozygous
human APOE 4/4 and APOE 3/3 knock-in genetic backgrounds to determine the differential impacts of APOE
genetic risk on molecular signatures of astrocytes in vivo. In Aim 1, I will test the hypothesis that APOE 4/4
astrocytes, compared to APOE 3/3, will exhibit elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, increased
complement protein production, amplified MAPK/ERK signaling, and aberrant changes in lipid metabolism. In
Aim 2, I will test the hypothesis that the exaggerated pro-inflammatory response of APOE4 astrocytes, initiated
by systemic inflammatory challenge (LPS), is mediated via ERK signaling. Using bioinformatic approaches on
proteomic and transcriptomic data and validation IHC approaches in mouse and human brain tissues, I will
identify molecular changes in reactivity states of APOE 4/4 and 3/3 astrocytes in vivo and identify ERK-
dependent and ERK-independent mechanisms of APOE. My work will lay the foundation to further investigate
astrocyte-mediated mechanisms of AD pathogenesis to employ CIBOP in future studies to explore cell type-
specific mechanisms of neurodegeneration, beyond AD and astrocytes."
10813161,"SIGNIFICANCE: G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a large family of membrane proteins that initiate
cellular responses to a wide range of extracellular signals, like neurotransmitters or hormones, by activating
heterotrimeric G proteins inside cells. This makes GPCRs critical for many physiological processes and their
dysregulation is frequently associated with disease. GPCRs are not only the family of proteins most widely
targeted by clinically approved drugs, with an estimated market value of hundreds of billions of dollars per
year, but also the subject of many ongoing campaigns towards novel therapeutics. Moreover, many GPCRs
still remain understudied and “undrugged”, which has great untapped potential for future drug discovery.
 Despite the biomedical importance of these receptors in physiology and pharmacology, the methodologies
currently used to measure GPCR signaling activity in cells have limitations that hinder progress. One
significant limitation is the use of approaches that compromise the fidelity of the readout because they are too
indirect and/or distort the natural stoichiometry of signaling components. Another significant limitation is that
many of the approaches are only feasible in cells in which gene delivery is easy, limiting their implementation
to a few cell lines instead of more physiologically relevant systems like primary cell cultures.
GOAL: Here, we propose to develop technologies that will allow to measure GPCR signaling activity directly
and in diverse, physiologically-relevant cell systems without introducing major perturbations on the natural
stoichiometry of signaling components. The tools and resources generated in this project will be made
available to other investigators without restrictions.
SYNOPSIS OF AIMS: We will develop two complementary assay platforms based on optical biosensors that
directly detect the activity of heterotrimeric G proteins. In Aim1, we will establish a suite of broadly applicable
“compact” vectors compatible with simple transfection or with viral packaging for the expression of G protein
activity biosensors. In Aim 2, we will validate mouse transgenic lines for the conditional expression of
biosensors of endogenous G protein activity. Collectively, these two platforms will allow the direct assessment
of GPCR signaling activity under native expression conditions, in physiologically relevant cellular systems, and
in formats that enable increased throughput to permit the parallel interrogation of the druggable GPCR-ome.
IMPACT: The achievement of our goal could transform how the large field of research interested in GPCR-
mediated cell communication approaches something as fundamental as measuring signaling activity. The
technologies to be developed here would advance the field by:
 (i) enabling the direct characterization of GPCR signaling in systems in which it is currently not possible,
 (ii) revealing mechanisms of GPCR signaling with unprecedented fidelity in diverse contexts, and/or
 (iii) facilitating pharmacological or mechanistic interrogation in formats compatible with increased throughput."
10808892,"Abstract
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a rapidly emerging public health risk. Approximately 35% of
Americans have NAFLD, and if left untreated, NAFLD can progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH),
cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Although obesity and Type II diabetes have emerged as risk factors,
disease pathogenesis is poorly understood. Accordingly, there are no FDA-approved pharmacotherapies
currently available for patients with NAFLD/NASH. An ideal therapeutic would target multiple hepatic lipid
homeostatic processes, including de novo lipogenesis (DNL), fatty acid oxidation (FAO), and very-low-density
lipoprotein (VLDL)-triglyceride (TG) secretion, as attempts to modulate a single lipid homeostatic process have
often led to undesirable compensation from the remaining pathways. Our lab has identified the protein folliculin
(FLCN) as a potential therapeutic target. Mice with hepatic deletion of FLCN are robustly protected against
steatosis when challenged with NAFLD-inducing diets via an FLCN-mTORC1-TFE3 signaling axis. TFE3
suppresses DNL and induces genes involved in FAO to decrease hepatic TG content in FLCN-null livers. Given
that VLDL-TG secretion is heavily regulated by TG availability, we expected to see a compensatory decrease in
VLDL-TG secretion rate in FLCN-null mice. Strikingly, however, we saw marked upregulation of VLDL-TG
secretion in FLCN deficient mice, which makes FLCN even more appealing as a therapeutic target. I hypothesize
that upregulated VLDL-TG secretion is critical to the robust protection against steatosis afforded by liver deletion
of FLCN, and that activated TFE3 is necessary and sufficient for VLDL-TG secretion. To test this, I will generate
FLCN knockout (KO), TFE3 KO, and FLCN/TFE3 double knockout (DKO) mice and assess VLDL-TG secretion
rates. I will overexpress constitutively active TFE3 in wild-type mice to test if TFE3 is sufficient for VLDL-TG
secretion. My preliminary data further lead me to hypothesize that the upregulated VLDL-TG secretion in FLCN-
null livers is mediated by TFE3-dependent transcriptional activation of CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase
alpha (CCTa). CCTa is the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine, a critical necessary
component for VLDL-TG secretion. My preliminary data show increased CCTa mRNA and protein levels in FLCN
knockout mice. I will generate FLCN KO, CCTa KO, FLCN/CCTa DKO mice. I will assess their susceptibility to
NAFLD/NASH and perform VLDL-TG secretion assays. Completion of this work would provide insight into the
regulation of hepatic lipid homeostatic processes affected in NAFLD/NASH, as well as demonstrate FLCN to be
a promising therapeutic target for treatment."
10910867,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Obesity is a primary driver of cardiometabolic disease and a major contributor to American mortality. One
potential mechanism of this is elevated ectopic lipid deposition in highly metabolic organs such as the liver and
skeletal muscle (SKM) leading to local and eventually systemic metabolic dysregulation. Myosteatosis is defined
as the infiltration of fat into skeletal muscle and is characterized by loss of muscle mass and accumulation of
intracellular lipids. These exogenously sourced fats contribute to an elevated lipogenic/lipolytic state whereby
lipid metabolites accumulate and impair insulin signaling, contributing to the development of systemic insulin
resistance and eventually cardiometabolic syndrome (CMS). Exercise is known to reverse insulin resistance and
ameliorate CMS independent of weight loss, though the mechanisms remain incompletely understood.
Moreover, while benefits of exercise are recognized, patient compliance and aging impede exercise utility,
suggesting the need for pharmacological interventions. Because SKM is the principal site of glucose disposal
and the most immediate effector of exercise-mediated adaptation, changes in its physiology provide the most
obvious mechanism for exercise-induced improvements to cardiovascular health seen in obese patients.
Preliminary data from this application establishes that obesity provides potent restraint on the growth of new
blood vessels in the face of ischemia, which is reversed with increased SKM mass due to deletion of MSTN in
mice, suggesting an important in vivo consequence of our prior studies showing profound endothelial
dysfunction. In novel data we show that GAL3 and NOX1 expression in endothelial cells isolated from these mice
are regulated by deletion of MSTN, suggesting that they are also mechanisms of impaired angiogenesis. The
impact of GAL3 and NOX1 deletion on obesity-related vascular diseases in vivo is largely unexplored. In this
application, we will explore the concept that obesity-driven ectopic fat accumulation in SKM drives vascular
dysfunction and impaired angiogenesis in a GAL-3 and NOX1 dependent manner. This goal will be met in two
specific aims. The first will use novel models uniquely developed in our lab to identify potential mechanistic
drivers (GAL3 and NOX1) of impaired vascular function in obesity that have been identified as improved in obese
hypermuscular mice. The second will use a newly made and novel knockout mouse design to resolve steatosis
in a genetic model of obesity and measure cardiovascular and metabolic outcomes to determine if removing
ectopic fat could serve as a viable therapeutic. The project will be directed under the mentorship of Dr. David
Stepp in the Vascular Biology Center at the Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University, which has a rich
history of successful pre- and post-doctoral training. The proposed project is for 3 years of funding with the
planned aims divided amongst the 3 years of funding, concluding with a dissertation defense at the end of the
third year. Taken together, the successful completion of these aims will identify at least three new potential
therapeutic targets in obesity-related vasculopathy that threaten the peripheral vasculature."
10816521,"ABSTRACT
Aberrant hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism is a feature of several prevalent metabolic disorders, including
obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Increased hepatic glucose
production directly contributes to hyperglycemia in patients with T2DM, and hepatic steatosis is the defining
feature of NAFLD. The increased prevalence of T2DM and NAFLD present a significant threat to public health,
and treatment strategies that address the underlying pathological processes are urgently needed. Although Ca2+
signaling in metabolic disease is emerging, the potential reciprocal role of Mg2+ dynamics on mitochondrial
bioenergetics is much less understood and is the focus of the current proposal. In preliminary studies, we
generated a global KO model of the mitochondrial Mg2+ transporter Mrs2 using CRISPR/Cas9 and examined the
impact on hepatic metabolism (Daw et al Cell 2020). Interestingly, loss of Mrs2 impairs mMg2+ uptake and
prevents hepatic steatosis in vivo. This is associated with increased mitochondrial respiratory capacity in
hepatocytes and markedly enhanced browning of white adipose tissue, indicative of increased capacity for
energy expenditure. Using innovative, unbiased RNA-seq, animal physiology studies, molecular, cell biological,
biochemistry and biophysical approaches, we have identified candidate pathways linking Mrs2-mediated mMg2+
uptake to mitochondrial suppression of OXPHOS and fatty acid oxidation under WD. Remarkably, the elevation
of de novo lipogenesis precursor citrate is blunted in Mrs2 KO mice and thus controls diet induced obesity. Based
on these preliminary data, we hypothesize that Mrs2-mediated mMg2+ uptake is a key determinant of
mitochondrial bioenergetic failure in the liver during disease progression, and that mitigating excess mMg2+
uptake using a small molecule blocker of the Mrs2 channel activity will prevent the development of NAFLD
through restoration of signaling and mitochondrial bioenergetics. The overall aim of the current proposal is to
identify molecular signals that are controlled by mMg2+ dynamics, and their impact on bioenergetics and
mitochondrial quality control, and to describe the molecular mechanisms linking Mrs2 to key hepatic metabolic
pathways that are dysregulated in metabolic diseases. Using a combination of integrative in vitro and in vivo
approaches, we will perform mechanistic studies to determine the impact of disrupted intracellular Mg2+ signals
on mitochondrial function, hepatic lipid and glucose metabolism, whole-body energy homeostasis, and the
progression of NAFLD. Given these preliminary findings, in Specific Aim 1 of the proposal we will employ our
unique mouse model to examine the role of Mrs2 and mMg2+ uptake on mitochondrial function in hepatocytes
and will determine the impact of impaired mMg2+ uptake on hepatic and whole-body glucose and lipid metabolism.
In Specific Aim 2, we will investigate the role of citrate in Hif-1α dependent signaling that is altered in Mrs2 KO,
which ultimately restores mitochondrial energetics and quality control. Finally, in Specific Aim 3, we will use both
genetic and pharmacologic interventions to evaluate the significance of MRS2 in NAFLD models."
10798275,"Breast screening has rapidly transitioned in the US to digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), an x-ray technology
in which 3-D images are reconstructed from a limited number of low-dose x-ray source projections. DBT offers
superior tissue visualization allowing for the direct measurement of the actual volume of dense tissue, rather
than an estimated percent or volume (from a 2-D mammogram). Since breast density is a strong predictor of
masking and risk, DBT volumetric density measures, including our recently developed and first of its kind, fully
automated 3-D measure, have the potential to improve individualized breast cancer (BC) risk prediction. No
studies to date have evaluated DBT volumetric density measures in large, diverse cohorts or subpopulations to
understand the impact of these measures to improve prediction of masking and risk in order to tailor prevention
and screening approaches. Our goal is to comprehensively examine DBT volumetric density measures
as risk factors for invasive, interval and advanced BC, and evaluate their impact on clinically relevant
BC risk models and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms across multiple racial groups. We propose this
research in three large breast screening cohorts that perform routine DBT, each with comprehensive clinical
risk factors, multiple DBT per woman, follow-up and BC outcomes. Specifically, we will establish a nested
case-control study of over 3,000 invasive BC cases and 9,000 controls matched on facility, age, race, ethnicity,
date of enrollment DBT and follow-up time and estimate novel research and commercial DBT volumetric
measures as well as ascertain clinical BI-RADS density from DBT screening exams from enrollment up to 6
months prior to diagnosis (or corresponding follow-up for controls). In Aim 1, we will evaluate DBT volumetric
density measures and their combinations as risk factors for invasive, interval and advanced BC, at enrollment
DBT exam, as well as DBT exams within five years of the cancer (or follow-up for controls), using state of the
art commercial and research algorithms. We will also assess differences in associations by time of DBT exam,
age, race, menopausal status and body mass index. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the contribution of DBT
volumetric density measures to clinical BC risk models, including the BCSC 5-year risk model, the novel BCSC
6-year cumulative risk model for advanced cancer, and secondarily, the Tyrer-Cuzick model for both 5 and 10-
year risk. Using these results, we will determine the impact of DBT density measures on high-risk thresholds
for preventative therapy and tailored imaging. Finally, in Aim 3, we will evaluate the contribution of DBT
volumetric density measures to three novel AI algorithms developed for BC risk and detection, with risk of
invasive, advanced and interval BC in the short- and longer-term. Our innovative study will be the largest to
inform how novel DBT volumetric density measures can augment BC risk-stratification and prediction
across multiple races and build a diverse resource to evaluate new DBT measures and risk models as
they evolve. These findings will build an evidence base to inform personalized prevention approaches."

10933413,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 B cell signaling is responsible for the generation of humoral immunity. It is initiated when an antigen binds
to a cell surface B cell receptor (BCR), triggering a signaling pathway that culminates in the secretion of
neutralizing antibodies. A critical aspect underlying the B cell response to an antigen is the strength of the signal
transmitted through the BCR, which is carefully regulated by various co-receptors in the B cell membrane.
Aberrant BCR signaling is closely associated with B cell dysfunction, including autoimmunity, B cell
malignancies, and immunodeficiency. Therefore, studying the regulatory mechanisms of BCR signaling by co-
receptors is needed to understand B cell immunity, how B cell-derived diseases arise, and will enable selective
targeting of malignant, autoreactive B cells to improve current therapeutics that cause severe
immunosuppression through global depletion of both normal and pathological B cells.
 This project will focus on the primary stimulatory B cell co-receptor, CD19, and will elucidate and
characterize the dynamic regulatory components it coordinates with during B cell activation. CD19 has an
essential role in regulating the initiation of B cell signaling, and it is among the most important immunotherapy
targets, meaning the results from this research program will inform both basic B cell biology and the design of
novel B cell targeting therapeutics. A significant challenge in studying B cell signaling is identifying and
characterizing dynamic regulatory complexes. To overcome this, we will leverage our expertise in structural
biology, protein engineering, and cell biology to develop new cell-based and protein tools to study these dynamic
complexes, allowing us to develop a mechanistic understanding of how CD19 coordinates with accessory co-
receptor components to control the strength of the signal transmitted through the BCR. This will be achieved
through three specific aims. First, we will identify and functionally characterize novel regulators of early B cell
signaling through CD19 proximity labeling coupled to quantitative, multiplexed mass spectrometry (Aim 1). Then,
we will determine the structure of a CD21-CD19 complex, which, combined with functional signaling assays, will
elucidate how the strength of BCR signaling is regulated in response to antigen binding (Aim 2). Finally, we will
engineer cell-state-specific, modulatory antibodies that stabilize the CD19-CD81 complex on resting B cells to
attenuate the immune response to antigen (Aim 3). This proposed research will elucidate the biochemical and
structural basis of regulation of CD19 signaling, identify new regulatory signaling proteins, and develop new ways
of selectively targeting and modulating autoreactive B cell function."

Mutations are heritable changes in the cellular genome and are key events in the induction of cancer, birth
defects, and neurological diseases. The lack of a mutagenicity bioassay in human cells is a major data gap in
the genetic toxicology test battery used by regulatory agencies for hazard identification and quantitative risk
assessments. ScitoVation is developing a New Approach Methodologies (NAMs) combining human cells and
Error Corrected Next Generation Sequencing as an in vitro alternative to current regulatory mammalian cell
mutagenicity assessment using rodent cell lines, and as an in vitro alternative to in vivo mutation assays."

11116005,"Over 30% of age-eligible Americans fail to receive recommended screening for colorectal cancer (CRC), the
second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Multilevel barriers explain why so many Americans
fail to receive routine CRC screening. Patients report a lack of knowledge about the need for screening or their
screening options, and many view screening as messy, uncomfortable, or embarrassing. Busy clinicians report
a lack of time to deliver preventive care, and many clinicians only discuss colonoscopy. Lastly, healthcare
systems lack strategies to reach out to patients independent of a scheduled medical visit. Disruptions caused
by COVID19 also have led to a decrease in the use of preventive services. To address these multilevel
barriers, our team has developed and tested a tablet-based digital health navigator for colorectal cancer
screening called mPATH™ (mobile Patient Technology for Health). mPATH™ determines if patients are due
for CRC screening, educates them about their options, and lets them request a screening test directly via the
program. In a randomized controlled trial conducted in primary care practices, mPATH™ doubled the
proportion of patients who completed CRC screening and had excellent usability ratings. However, we have
learned that our tablet-based model of mPATH™ is difficult to scale as it requires on-site training and changes
to workflows. The goal of this Fast Track STTR proposal is to develop and test a cloud-based version of
mPATH™ that patients can use at home independent of a scheduled medical visit. Patients will access
mPATH™ on their own devices using a hyperlink sent via text message or patient portal. The cloud version of
mPATH™ will have the proven effective content of the tablet version, including the ability to request a
screening test directly via the program. mPATH™ will then share this information with the patient’s healthcare
organization so screening can be arranged. This cloud-based version will be highly scalable, have broad
reach, and be easy to support, making it a commercially viable product. To accomplish this goal, the work of
this proposal will: (1) create a culturally appropriate and engaging cloud-based version of mPATH™ by
leveraging input from community members, an expert Scientific Advisory Committee, and feedback from users;
(2) determine the feasibility of the cloud-based mPATH™-CRC web app in a highly pragmatic pilot trial
conducted in a large health system; (3) test the reach and effectiveness of the mPATH™ web app in two
different healthcare settings: a large health system, and an Accountable Care Organization that includes rural
Federally Qualified Health Centers; and (4) determine the value generated by mPATH™ in each healthcare
setting. This Fast Track STTR will provide information that is critical to mPATH™’s future commercialization by
demonstrating its reach into diverse populations, its effectiveness in increasing screening, and the value it
generates to potential future customers. If successful, mPATH™ will fill a critical need for a commercially
available, easily scalable solution for colorectal cancer screening and potentially other preventive services."

Project Summary:
Sepsis is an incompletely understood clinical syndrome characterized by a dysregulated host response to
infection. In partnership with 8 U.S. hospitals, Prenosis amassed one of the world’s largest datasets and biobanks
that combines biomarker and clinical data for patients suspected of infection, housing over 70,000 plasma or
serum samples from over 14,000 patients. We also curated a dataset of dense time-series data from each
patient’s Electronic Medical Record (EMR), including demographics, vitals, lab results, interventions, outcomes,
and many other parameters. To commercialize insights from these data, Prenosis built ImmunixTM, an FHR/HL7
compatible software platform for clinical deployment of diagnostics and clinical decision support tools.
Under a previously awarded NIGMS grant (1R44GM139529), Prenosis built a testing pipeline to measure 40
critical protein biomarkers from biobanked samples. To date, we measured these biomarkers on only the initial
sample per patient for 6,000 patients and combined these data with EMR clinical parameters to construct 8
endotypes of sepsis. The identification and classification of endotypes—groupings of patients with similar
biologic and clinical features—is increasingly becoming recognized as a valuable methodologic approach to
assessing patients with sepsis. To complete work for the existing grant, Prenosis will measure the baseline
sample for additional patients to total about 10,000 patients to refine and validate the endotypes.
In this project, Prenosis proposes to add a critical new dimension to the data by assaying and analyzing
longitudinal, time-series biomarker data. We will leverage our pipeline to measure the 40 core biomarkers from
9,000 follow-up samples from ~3,400 patients that we have already collected and stored in the biobank. We
will assess the additional value of longitudinal time-series biomarker measurements and clinical data. Initial
feasibility data from over 1,000 measured samples demonstrates that longitudinal data provide additional
powerful new biologic and prognostic insights. Analytics built upon these data have the potential to improve
diagnostic and drug development products for sepsis and COVID. The overall hypothesis of this project is that
longitudinal biomarkers will add a valuable biologic and prognostic dimension to endotypes for sepsis; and these
longitudinal endotypes will better classify patients who may have a heterogeneous response to sepsis therapies."
10892116,"Project Summary:
EGFR-mutant lung cancers (LCs) are initially highly responsive to EGFR inhibitors, but cancer adaptation
resulting in drug resistance universally occurs. Acquired resistance mediated by lineage plasticity is particularly
problematic; EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinomas (ACs) can transform into either small cell (SC) or squamous
cell (SQ) lung cancers. Understanding the molecular determinants of histologic transformation is critical to inform
therapeutic strategies to block the emergence of new cell lineage states induced by cancer treatments. We have
established that concurrent alterations in TP53 and RB1 are necessary but not sufficient to induce SC
transformation in EGFR-mutant LCs; EGFR/TP53/RB1-mutant LCs have a 25% likelihood of transformation over
time. In addition, we have assembled a cohort of resected mixed histology tumors (AC/SC and AC/SQ) that
serve as a model of transformation where microdissection by histology isolates paired tumors representing pre-
and post- transformation states. Using these complementary systems directly derived from patients, we will
perform a mechanistic analysis of lineage plasticity utilizing EGFR/TP53/RB1-mutant LCs at high risk for
transformation and mixed histology tumors that represent transformation in progress.
Our central hypothesis is that while the somatic mutational landscape is critical in establishing conditions
permissive of lineage plasticity, actual transformation to an alternative lineage is predominantly epigenetically
driven and associated with consistent globally altered patterns of gene expression. Our first aim is to
comprehensively molecularly characterize lineage plasticity using parallel whole exome, RNA and bisulfite
sequencing focusing on patient samples from before, during (mixed AC/SC and AC/SQ) and after transformation.
Resected mixed histology tumors (AC/SQ) will be microdissected and molecularly characterized as paired
tumors. The second aim of the proposal is to investigate subclonal dynamics contributing to lineage plasticity
using single cell RNA-sequencing. We will interrogate serial samples from our ongoing clinical trial to prevent
transformation in patients with EGFR/TP53/RB1-mutant lung ACs and resected mixed histology AC/SC and
AC/SQ tumors. Finally, we will utilize our patient-derived xenograft models of transformation to genetically and
pharmacologically assess putative drivers of transformation, exploring rational interventional strategies. Our
preliminary work has proposed initial targets (Wnt, EZH2, AKT, NOTCH) that will be expanded with findings from
this proposal. Novel therapeutic interventions will be proposed based on our findings that can be rapidly
translated to the clinical setting for LC and other disease states characterized by lineage plasticity."
10907621,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Despite the importance of β cell failure in the progression of diabetes (type 1, type 2, and multiple monogenic
forms), the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for β cell dysfunction remain incompletely understood.
Release of insulin from the pancreatic β cell occurs in response to dynamic changes in cytosolic calcium (Ca2+)
levels. To date, the majority of studies of β cell physiology have focused on the regulation of Ca2+ influx via
plasma membrane ion channels, which have traditionally been more amenable to study via electrophysiological
approaches. These studies have supported a dominant role for KATP channel-dependent plasma membrane
depolarization and Ca2+ influx via voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in the regulation of insulin release, especially in
response to very high concentrations of glucose. However, recent improvements in high temporal resolution
imaging pioneered by our group have enabled the detection of robust Ca2+ signals in β cells stimulated with more
physiologically relevant glucose concentrations, even in the absence of changes in plasma membrane potential,
pointing to a critical role for the regulated release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. In support of this, our published
and preliminary data show that pharmacological manipulation of the activity of intracellular ryanodine receptors
(RYR) uniquely modulates these ultrafast Ca2+ release events, even in voltage-clamp conditions, while also
impacting glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Together with other groups, we have found that the RYR2 isoform
predominates in pancreatic β cells, and importantly showed using qRT-PCR and mass spectometry-based
proteomics that RYR2 mRNA and protein can be identified in human and mouse islets and purified β cells.
Furthermore, our preliminary data indicate that mice with β cell selective Ryr2 knockout have reduced insulin
secretion and glucose intolerance, while ex vivo studies suggest that ER Ca2+ leak via dysregulated RYR activity
leads to alterations in β cell Ca2+ signalling and accelerated β cell death. Against this background, we
hypothesize that RYR2 channels serve as critical rheostats of β cell health and function and that they play key
roles in diabetes progression. To test this hypothesis, we have assembled a multidisciplinary MPI team with
expertise in β cell biology, diabetes physiology, quantitative imaging, and disease modelling, and three specific
aims are proposed. In Specific Aim 1, we will quantify β cell RYR2 activity and roles in pancreatic slices and in
vivo using intravital imaging. Specific Aim 2 will determine the in vivo role of β cell RYR2 in insulin secretion, β
cell survival, and glucose homeostasis using a highly β cell-specific knockout mouse model. Specific Aim 3 will
utilize mass spectrometry to determine mechanisms underlying ER stress-induced RYR2 dysfunction and in vitro
and in vivo mouse models to define how ER stress-induced RYR2 dysfunction impacts β cell Ca2+ signaling and
survival."

10913336,"ABSTRACT
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides genome-wide information about gene expression at the
resolution of individual cells. The unprecedented scope of these data is revolutionizing our understanding of
development and tissue homeostasis as well as diseases like cancer. A major issue with scRNA-seq, however,
is the shear scale of the data, consisting of ~20,000 gene expression measurements in thousands to millions
of cells. Effective computational approaches are clearly required to translate data of this size and complexity
into actionable biological insights. For instance, scRNA-seq data are approximately 20,000-dimensional, and
as a result all available analysis pipelines rely on multiple dimensionality reduction steps. This usually entails a
combination of linear tools like PCA and non-linear techniques like t-SNE and UMAP. The data is generally
reduced to between 10- and 100-D for data analysis (e.g. clustering into distinct cell types) and 2-D for
visualization. The problem, however, is that dimensionality reduction can lead to loss of information. We
recently showed that this loss of information is dramatic: for any given cell, over 95% of its neighbors are
changed in the process of dimensionality reduction. This complete change in the structure of the data can
introduce significant noise and bias into the analysis, and suggests the critical need for alternative approaches.
The premise of this application is that reducing bias in scRNA-seq data analysis will maximize our ability to
extract meaningful information from the data. In this proposal, we focus on developing new algorithms to
address three specific steps in the typical analysis pipeline: (1) Dimensionality Reduction: Our hypothesis is
that deep neural networks can be explicitly trained to maximize the amount of information that can be retained
for both data analysis and visualization. (2) Feature Selection: Not all genes are equally informative for
downstream analyses, so researchers generally choose a subset of genes based on variation in the
population. We have shown that standard approaches to selecting genes convolve true biological variation with
technical noise from the experiment. We hypothesize that statistical models based on our understanding of
sources of technical noise can be used to select more informative genes. (3) Cell clustering: Clustering the
data to determine cell types is critical, but cells with different identities often form complex, overlapping
geometries in gene expression space that are difficult for existing algorithms to resolve. Our hypothesis is that
new clustering tools, guided by prior knowledge and leveraging innovations in clustering from image
segmentation, can overcome this problem. We will build these new tools and test them against existing
benchmark datasets and novel data generated by our experimental collaborators. We will also integrate these
tools into popular scRNA-seq analysis packages. Successful completion of the proposed work will allow the
field to extract more biologically relevant information from the burgeoning set of scRNA-seq datasets."
10908280,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Opioid use has dramatically increased in the United States since 2000, and disproportionally affects individuals
with co-occurring mental health disorders (COD). Individuals with COD are vulnerable to substance use relapses,
mental health symptom exacerbations, opioid overdoses, suicide, homelessness, and criminal justice
involvement. Although medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) is the gold standard of care, engagement
rates are as low as 18% which negatively impact outcomes. In addition, there is mixed evidence regarding the
incremental therapeutic benefit of adding single behavioral interventions to improve MOUD outcomes, despite
being recommended in clinical practice guidelines. Furthermore, while multi-component interventions exist, little
is known about their incremental therapeutic effect on outcomes in conjunction with MOUD and standard medical
management for those with a COD. Maintaining Independence and Sobriety through Systems Integration,
Outreach and Networking (MISSION) is one such multi-component, cross-disciplinary, team-based treatment
approach, combining 3 evidence-based practices along with MOUD: 1) Dual Recovery Therapy (DRT), which is
integrated group therapy for COD; 2) Peer Support (PS), offering support for people in recovery by people in
recovery; and 3) Critical Time Intervention (CTI), a time-limited form of assertive community treatment. Although
the effectiveness of MISSION is well established, given the difficulty with implementation uptake in large systems
due to its complexity and the need to improve outcomes for those with a COD who receive MOUD, a critical next
step is to understand the incremental therapeutic benefit of MISSION + MOUD, and identify highest value
MISSION components that drive the largest clinical improvement and offer the greatest return on investment.
In response to RFA-MH-21-145, the proposed 4-year study with a half fractional factorial design, “Supporting
Treatment Access and Recovery for Co-occurring Opioid Use and Mental Health Disorders (STAR-COD),” will
randomize 1,000 patients with COD across 9 MOUD programs to the following 5 conditions: 1) MOUD alone; 2)
full MISSION protocol (CTI & DRT & PS) + MOUD; 3) CTI & DRT + MOUD; 4) PS & DRT + MOUD; or 5) CTI &
PS + MOUD. There are four specific aims. Aim 1: To evaluate the effectiveness of MISSION or its components
with MOUD versus MOUD alone, as well as the incremental benefits of MISSION or bundled parts + MOUD to
improve engagement, substance use and mental health symptoms. Aim 2: To examine mechanisms of action
of MISSION in COD. Aim 3: To conduct a comprehensive economic evaluation of MISSION or its parts and
MOUD. Exploratory Aim: 4. To construct a predictive model to match optimum combined use of MISSION parts
with patient needs to improve health outcomes. This proposal is aligned with NIMH’s strategic plan goal 4 “to
increase the public health impact of services studies, investigators test ways to adapt, implement, and scale
effective interventions for varied populations across multiple service settings in a cost-effective manner.” Upon
completion, it could offer more cost effective, robust, personalized treatments."
10884875,"Project Summary
Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) usually express an M2 phenotype which enables them to perform
immunosuppressive and tumor-promoting functions. Reprogramming these TAMs toward an M1 phenotype
could thwart their pro-cancer activities and unleash anti-tumor immunity, but current efforts to accomplish this
are nonspecific and elicit systemic inflammation. Our group at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center has
developed a targeted nanocarrier that can deliver in vitro-transcribed mRNA encoding M1-polarizing
transcription factors to reprogram TAMs without causing systemic toxicity. With the goal of designing the first
clinical trial for treating chemotherapy-resistant ovarian cancer patients with this nanodrug, we propose here
research that will generate the data required for an IND application. Specifically, we will (1) develop a robust
protocol for the scaled-up production of genetic macrophage-programming nanoparticles under GMP-
conditions so they can be carried forward into large primate and human studies, (2) identify potential infusion
reaction risks, with reference to FDA regulations for nanomedicines, and (3) confirm safety of the nanoparticles
for clinical use in a large-animal species. We expect the outcome of the proposed research will help propel this
approach into clinical practice for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer, and provide knowledge to design
a broad repertoire of nanotherapeutics that genetically reprogram TAMs as a strategy to treat other tumor
types."

Despite extensive choice and increasing availability, current contraceptive options are not meeting the needs of
many women, as is evident by high levels of typical-use failure, method non-use, switching, and discontinuation.
Approximately half of all pregnancies (121 million) around the world are unintended and 218 million women have
an unmet need for effective contraception. New technologies having attributes more closely aligned with users’
needs and expectations are urgently needed to fill this critical gap in sexual and reproductive healthcare. The
overall goal of this P50 center is to bring together some of the leading research organizations in the world with
unrivalled expertise and know-how around design, manufacture and testing of intravaginal ring (IVR) technology
– including Population Council (PC), Queen's University Belfast (QUB), and Weill Cornell Medical College
(WCMC) – in a concerted effort to develop a new, practical, easy-to-use, long-acting, multipurpose prevention
technology (MPT) IVR offering both spermicidal activity and broad antibacterial/antiviral activity against various
common sexually transmitted/vaginal infections, including chlamydia, gonorrhea, bacterial vaginosis (BV), and
infection with herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Unlike other
marketed and experimental contraceptive IVR products, we are committed here to the development of a non-
hormonal contraceptive strategy, referred to as the CZL-IVR, in which copper ions or copper salts (C), zinc ions
or zinc salts (Z), and lactide (L) are simultaneously administered to the vagina in a sustained/controlled manner
over at least 30 days. The overarching goal of Project 2, which involves a strategic and highly integrated
partnership between Queen's University Belfast (QUB) and Population Council (PC), is to provide
formulation support for the P50 project. Specifically, this will involve all aspects of CZL-IVR product
design, formulation, manufacture and in vitro testing, according to three key aims: In Aim 1, we will
develop a CZL-IVR that releases copper, zinc and lactide for at least 30 days in quantities sufficient for
clinical efficacy; in Aim 2, we will design, manufacture and characterize non-medicated IVRs and sensor-
embedded IVRs for end-user testing; and in Aim 3, we will complete technology transfer between QUB
and PC and GMP manufacture the IVRs for clinical evaluation for Project 3. Project 1 will be closely
coordinated with Projects 2 and 3 to inform IVR loading and selection of the lead IVR. Our multidisciplinary
collaborative team is uniquely qualified to advance the development of this novel MPT IVR. The CZL-IVR will
address a critical gap in the non-hormonal contraceptive landscape, fill a niche that users want and deliver an
important public health intervention."
10867329,"Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases in the United States. There is mounting evidence
that medications that inhibit the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism are linked to
new onset asthma, strongly suggesting that COX metabolic products inhibit the development of asthma.
These data are supported by numerous mechanistic animal studies published by the Principal Investigator (PI)
which revealed that COX inhibition increased lung expression of the CD4 T helper 2 (Th2) cytokines IL-5 and
IL-13 that are important in airway eosinophilia, mucus expression, and airway responsiveness (AR), all
hallmarks of allergic asthma. Several studies by the PI and other groups revealed that the COX product
prostaglandin (PG)I2 restrains the development of allergic inflammation by inhibiting proinflammatory cytokine
secretion by CD4 Th2 cells; however, the mechanisms by which PGI2 exerts these anti-inflammatory effects
are not completely defined. Our novel, unpublished preliminary data reveals that
PGI2
signaling inhibited
glycolysis, glycolytic capacity, and glycolytic reserve in CD4 Th2 cells, suggesting that PGI2 has a
critical role in CD4 T cell immunometabolism. We provide evidence in our preliminary data that PGI2
decreases CD4 Th2 expression of Glut1, the glucose transporter that is essential for the uptake of glucose and
amino acids into the cell and which is required for glycolysis. Additional preliminary data of targeted
metabolomics identified the glutamine metabolism pathway as being substantially regulated when CD4
Th2 cells were polarized in the presence or absence of the PGI2 analog cicaprost. However, the
mechanisms by which
PGI2
signaling inhibits glycolysis and the glutamine metabolic pathway are not known.
In this application, we will test the overall hypothesis that PGI2 restrains allergen-induced airway
inflammation by inhibiting glucose and glutamine metabolism in Th2 effector cells, thus defining the
immunometabolic mechanisms by which PGI2 restrains allergic inflammation in the lung.
 In this application, we will use complementary genetic and pharmacologic approaches, both in vivo and
in in vitro experiments using primary CD4 T lymphocytes. We will create novel model organisms to definitively
determine how regulates glycolysis and glutamine metabolism using conditional mice floxed for the PGI2
receptor IP, that were specifically created through funding of the last cycle of this Merit Award. This current
Merit proposal is clinically relevant in defining the immunometabolic mechanisms by which PGI2 inhibits CD4
differentiation and function in allergic airway inflammation, thus providing support for the use of PGI2 in the
treatment of allergic diseases such as asthma. The proposed experiments will be paradigm shifting by being
the first to define how a prostaglandin regulates immunometabolism and will advance the field and the health
of our nation's Veterans by discovering new therapeutic pathways for diseases that are exacerbated by
increases in the glycolytic and glutaminolysis pathways. Further, these studies may define new mechanisms
by which PGI2 is beneficial in other diseases states, such as pulmonary hypertension, for which CD4 T
lymphocytes are becoming increasingly recognized as having a pathogenic role. Thus, this application
provides an opportunity for basic science discovery, as well as having important treatment implications for
hypersensitivity diseases, including asthma.

This Phase II SBIR will develop and demonstrate the efficacy of the Opioid Rapid Response System (ORRS) to
improve responses to opioid overdoses. Opioid overdoses exact a tremendous cost in lives and expenditures.
Naloxone has been developed to counteract overdoses; however, the nature of these events requires a rapid
response, a situation that challenges emergency responders in both lightly populated rural areas as well as
densely populated urban communities. Apps now exist with the potential to obviate timing concerns by linking
lay citizen responders to events through the 911 system. One such app, PulsePoint, is already in place in 4,100
communities throughout the U.S. for cardiac events, while two other potential partners, OpiSafe and Brave,
focus on overdoses and have expanding customer bases. Other communities simply distribute naloxone as
widely as possible. Neither naloxone distribution nor the apps can accomplish their goals without effectively
recruiting and training many citizen responders who are both able to administer life-saving naloxone and
confident in their ability to do so. To date, there are no evidence-based programs to accomplish these goals.
This project is designed to develop innovative and effective recruitment and training strategies to fill this gap.
ORRS was based on a pilot project demonstrating that lay citizen responders could utilize the PulsePoint app to
respond to overdose events. In Phase I, we developed an effective recruitment protocol based on identity theory
that uses appeals to individuals (personal identity appeals) and others (communal appeals) and administered it
through multi-modalities. We also developed a prototype of ORRS online training and demonstrated usability
and feasibility through a study in five Indiana counties. In Phase II, ORRS recruitment will be refined to
improve the performance of the social media component, the training platform will be enhanced to focus on
CPR and stigma reduction as well as enhanced engagement, and a national RCT will be conducted in 8
communities. Recruitment and training effects on psychological and behavioral outcomes will be evaluated.
The project has great promise for rapid and wide dissemination through the PulsePoint, OpiSafe, and Brave
Technology Coop networks of communities as well as public health departments. The project has the potential
to develop a model for community responses to similar public health events."
10817774,"Project Summary / Abstract
Significance
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality with a 5-year survival rate of less than 20% following
standard of care therapy.
Problem
Despite the use of aggressive surgery, combination chemotherapy and immunotherapy, a major limitation in the
control of primary and metastatic non-small cell pulmonary tumors with the use of the systemic administration of
drugs is the low drug concentration in the lungs due to blood volume dilution and metabolism. There is a critical
unmet medical need to develop new strategies to improve patient treatment outcomes.
Innovation
In contrast to systemic delivery of chemotherapy, inhalation delivers a chemotherapeutic drug directly to tumor
tissues in the lung thereby enhancing its efficacy and safety due to increased local drug concentration in the
lung, decreased systemic drug levels in the circulation, and decreased systemic toxicity.
Gap
Preliminary pre-clinical in-vivo studies using nebulized chemotherapy drugs has demonstrated efficacy and
established the feasibility of delivery via aerosol, but nebulization of toxic drugs has major drawbacks. These
drawbacks include a lack of efficient peripheral airway penetration, high mouth-throat deposition, contamination
of equipment, and collateral aerosol risk to medical staff.
Project Objective
To address these drawbacks, we are developing a new method of delivering a chemotherapeutic drug via
inhalation to reach pulmonary tumors directly in order to maximize the effectiveness and safety of the aerosol
treatment with a fraction of the standard dose. We will create a novel dry powder chemotherapeutic formulation
containing an FDA approved chemotherapy medication for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.
Aims
Aims of this proposal will be 1) scale-up the lead Quench EEG formulation and conduct characterization, stability,
and performance studies, and 2) conduct IND-enabling toxicology studies in an established inhalation toxicology
rodent model for regulatory submission.
Commercial Potential
Translation of this technology into a clinically beneficial inhalable chemotherapy product has the potential to
significantly improve the treatment of pulmonary tumors in lung cancer patients by delivering targeted lower
doses of medicine directly to the lung while minimizing systemic toxicity."
10814296,"Our proposal is in direct response to the special Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) PAR-21-068
“Multidisciplinary Studies of HIV/AIDS and Aging (R01)”. A frailty phenotype is frequently observed in HIV
patients on long term antiretroviral therapy (ART), and both osteoporosis and sarcopenia are now recognized as
co-morbidities among older people with HIV. Loss of muscle mass and strength are in turn associated with poor
health outcomes ranging from falls and fractures to accelerated disease progression and increased mortality.
Our goal is to address this problem by providing critical, new information on the cellular and molecular
mechanisms underlying musculoskeletal dysfunction with HIV infection and ART, and thereby improve scientific
knowledge, technical capability, and eventually clinical practice. Recent studies identify the aryl hydrocarbon
receptor (AhR) as playing a key role in regulating organismal aging and lifespan. Our group has found that AhR
activation can induce senescence in bone marrow stem cells, and others have observed that AhR
overexpression induces muscle atrophy. Uniting these observations, our central hypothesis is that muscle- and
bone-specific AhR activation are key drivers of muscle and bone loss in patients with HIV on ART. Our
preliminary data provide a strong rationale for this hypothesis and indicate that 1) markers of muscle atrophy,
bone loss, and AhR activation are increased in our mouse model of HIV infection, 2) AhR is highly expressed in
muscle and bone, and targeted knockout of AhR in these tissues increases lean mass and trabecular bone mass,
3) pharmacological inhibition of AhR increases muscle strength and markers of bone formation in mice, and 4)
the antiretroviral emtricitabine (FTC) increases AhR activation and senescence in muscle cells and these effects
are attenuated by AhR silencing. Specific Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that AhR activation is a key factor driving
muscle and bone loss with aging and HIV infection. Specific Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that AhR activation is a
key factor driving muscle and bone loss with aging and antiretroviral therapy. Our expected outcomes include 1)
defining the role of AhR in skeletal muscle and bone with HIV infection and ART so that it can be targeted
therapeutically, and 2) characterizing the impact of aging and ART on AhR activation in skeletal muscle and
bone. In the future this knowledge may be critical in the diagnosis, treatment and management of vulnerable
patient populations debilitated by the vast array of HIV- and age-induced pathologies. Ultimately, these data will
enable clinicians to improve disease outcomes and, consequently, public health."
11113670,"Project Summary:
This is a fast-track SBIR grant proposal. As effective gene therapy (GT) products using adeno-associated
viral (AAV) vectors advance to clinical applications, the translation faces critical challenge of high prevalence
of αAA) antibodies (Abs) in humans. Currently, only individuals negative of αAAV-Abs are eligible for AAV GT
treatment. The goal of this SBIR project is to develop a therapeutic product capable of effectively depleting
Abs towards clinical application and commercialization, in order to make potentially life-saving AAV GT
products available to all patients in need of administration and re-administration.
To address the challenge of pre-existing αAAV-Abs, we have developed a new effective Ab-depleting protein
product, antibody cleaver (AbC), based on the demonstrated IgG degrading enzymes of Streptococci (IdeS).
IdeS specifically cleaves IgG of humans, primate, sheep and rabbit (but not mouse) origin. Numerous studies
demonstrate effective transient IgG degradation by IdeS in animals and humans, with no detectable dose
limiting toxicity. Our preliminary studies showed effective Ab depletion by an IV AbC infusion, leading to the
transient clearance of pre-existing αAAV9-Abs and allowing effective transduction in rabbitized αAAV9-Abs-
positive MPS IIIA mice after an IV scAAV9-hSGSH delivery. We believe that IV AbC administration offers a
great tool to overcome the pre-existing αAAV-Abs for the translation of rAAV GT to treat diseases in humans.
This proposal is to further develop and establish an optimal AbC Ab-depletion regimen for systemic rAAV9
gene delivery. In Phase I studies, we will identify optimal AbC product. Once validated, in Phase II, the
optimal Ab-C product will be evaluated in pre-clinical studies in animal models (Aim #2, 3), to assess the
efficacy and therapeutic potential of transient Ab-depletion by AbC. In Phase II, we will also optimize the
AbC production procedures for scale-up manufacture towards clinical application and commercialization (Aim
#4). Notably, The Phase II studies will lead to an IND and subsequent clinical trials to bridge the AbC
administration with systemic scAAV9-hSGSH gene replacement therapy clinical trials in patients with MPS
IIIA, for which an IND were recently submitted. More importantly, the AbC Ab depletion may offer the answer
to the challenge posed by pre-existing Abs to gene therapy products using AAV and other viral vectors in
general."

10907690,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Barth syndrome (BTHS) is a genetic disorder due to mutations in the X-linked tafazzin (TAZ) gene
encoding an enzyme required for the functioning of mitochondria, the energy powerhouses of our cells. Patients
with inherited TAZ mutations suffer from a wide range of clinical manifestations, from neutropenia to severe left
ventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy and skeletal muscle weakness. Other mitochondrial diseases
produce similar but not identical symptoms, possibly reflecting distinct types of mitochondrial impairment in
different tissues. Thus, understanding of molecular pathogenesis of BTHS and other mitochondriopathies is
highly significant for the health of the general public. However, it is not mechanistically clear how and why faulty
TAZ function produces impairment of largely the male heart, immune and musculoskeletal systems.
Furthermore, the establishment of proper mouse models of BTHS, as in other human genetic diseases, is
imperative to study BTHS in vivo and test potential therapies. Although the work of others has shown an
important role for tafazzin in the heart, this has necessitated the use of alternative mouse models, including
inducible shRNA Taz knockdown and “mixed Taz chimeras”, that are unable to mirror BTHS pathogenesis nor
phenocopy its progressive clinical manifestations. In preliminary studies, we overcame this crucial limitation of
in vivo BTHS syndrome research by editing a BTHS patient’s TAZ mutation into the orthologous conserved
residue of murine Taz gene by CRISPR/CAS technology. Preliminary data show our novel patient-specific Taz
point mutant male mice (TazPM that express mutant Taz at normal levels) display all key indicators of BTHS, from
impaired granulopoiesis to lethal fetal and postnatal non-compaction cardiomyopathy and impaired cardiolipin
biosynthesis. In order test which lineages are primarily affected, we generated a cardiomyocyte-restricted floxed
(TazcKO) mutant that develops postnatal cardiomyopathy with mitochondria and cardiolipin defects. We will test
our hypothesis that lack of cardiolipin and mitochondrial immaturity impedes in utero trabeculation whilst loss of
Taz catalytic activity dictates the timing and severity of postnatal hypoglycemic heart pathology, glycolytic
reprogramming and survival. Therefore, we are actively pursuing multidisciplinary pre- and postnatal longitudinal
cardiovascular phenotyping and metabolic testing of these unique mouse models to understand the in vivo
course of disease in comparison to humans, and testing whether TAFAZZIN replacement therapy and in vivo
pharmacological amelioration can mitigate the life-threatening BTHS birth defects in our patient-specific mouse
model. Together, this precision medicine-based proposal will provide mechanistic insights into the molecular
pathogenesis of the various cardiomyopathies resulting from TAZ disruption, unravel novel leads for evidence-
driven candidate therapies and help create patient-specific platforms to test personalized therapeutic strategies
for BTHS in future studies."
10815562,"Most individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) retain spared neural activity at and below the site of
injury, activating these neural circuits may enhance neural plasticity to promote recovery of motor,
sensory, and autonomic function. Individuals with SCI struggle with life-long autonomic nervous
system (ANS) dysfunction with serious adverse consequences. The dynamic balance between the
sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the ANS is impaired in individuals with SCI at or above
T6, which negatively impacts internal homeostasis during daily activities such as transferring from the
supine to the seated position, regulating core body temperature (Tcore), and exercise performance.
For the estimated millions of people living with SCI globally, impaired ANS regulation is common, and
has been implicated in widespread cardiovascular complications, which are a leading cause of
morbidity and mortality in this population. One of the most prominent consequences of cardiovascular
ANS impairment is blood pressure (BP) instability, which includes hypotension, orthostatic
hypotension (OH), and autonomic dysreflexia (AD). These BP impairments lead to an absence or
reversal of the nocturnal BP dip, and increased daytime sleepiness, which detract from
wellbeing, independence, social engagement and quality of life. Further, ANS cardiovascular
impairment in athletes with SCI limits the heart rate (HR) response during competition, lowers BP,
and increases fatigue, thereby compromising endurance and sports performance. In fact, some
athletes with SCI enhance their performance in competition by self-inducing AD, a practice
known as “boosting,” to increase BP and create a generalized efferent sympathetic response.
In addition to cardiovascular complications, ANS deficits post-SCI also contribute to abnormal
sudomotor function and dysregulation of Tcore. With climate change becoming increasingly
apparent, the effects of wide variation in environmental conditions are anticipated to be more
severe and more devastating to overall health, independence, and quality of life in individuals
with SCI who lack adequate ANS thermoregulatory control. For these reasons, individuals with
SCI prioritize restoration of ANS functions higher than regaining the ability to walk; however, there are
no clinical interventions proven to be safe and effective for managing widespread ANS dysfunction
following SCI. This project will focus on using non-invasive, transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation
(TSCS) to restore intrinsic ANS control of BP and determine the effects on exercise endurance and
Tcore. A recent report found that the use of TSCS in 6 individuals with cervical SCI (C3-C5)
improved ANS regulation of HR, sudomotor, thermoregulation, and bladder control and a separate
team found that TSCS restored ANS control of orthostatic BP, cardiac contractility, and cerebral blood
flow velocity in 5 individuals with chronic motor-complete SCI (C5-T2). Most recently, the safety and
efficacy of TSCS was reported during digital anal rectal stimulation (DARS), a known trigger of AD, in
one individual with chronic, motor-complete SCI (C4). The results indicate that TSCS parameters
targeted for BP control restored baseline BP after AD was induced during DARS, and prevented the
BP rise when TSCS was administered before DARS onset. Thus, TSCS does not merely increase
BP, rather targeted stimulation parameters appear to restore intrinsic ANS regulation of BP. Herein,
we propose to test TSCS parameters targeted for BP control (active TSCS) on exercise endurance,
HR recovery from exercise, Tcore responses and subjective reporting of thermal comport during
exposure to a cool ambient environment, in a cohort of participants with chronic SCI, during well
controlled trials compared to a sham TSCS stimulation paradigm."
10892668,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease of the central nervous system that affects approximately 1 million
people in the US and is the #1 cause of non-traumatic disability in young adults. Cognitive dysfunction,
including deficits in processing speed, visual memory, verbal fluency, working memory, and executive
functioning, is one of the most common problems in MS. Cognitive dysfunction in MS exerts a dire impact on
many aspects of health-related quality of life. Unfortunately, progress in developing preventative,
compensatory and restorative interventions for cognitive dysfunction in MS is stymied by major gaps in our
knowledge of its natural history, mechanisms, and impacts where it matters most – in the everyday lives of
people with MS. Our understanding of cognitive function in MS is restricted by two major factors:
measurement limitations and lack of scientific attention to potential contributors to and consequences of
declines in cognition. This study leverages advances in technology-assisted ambulatory assessment
techniques to provide a unique and multidimensional window onto the experience of cognitive dysfunction in
the everyday lives of people with MS. In this study, we will use multiple complementary ambulatory
assessment strategies to better understand cognitive dysfunction in MS. A customized smartphone app will
be used to administer a battery of ambulatory cognitive tests that are designed specifically for serial
administration in the lived environment as well as ecological momentary assessments (real-time assessment)
of self-reported symptoms and functioning as a person goes about daily life. The smartphone app will be
paired with accelerometer technology, which will provide objective, continuous, and unobtrusive measures of
physical activity. Ambulatory assessments will be administered in a “measurement burst design,”
incorporating bursts of intensive repeated assessment over two weeks, with bursts repeated longitudinally, at
baseline, and 1- and 2- year follow-up. Using these innovative assessment measures and methods, we will
test whether ambulatory measures of subjective and objective cognitive function are more sensitive to
longitudinal changes (over 2 years) in cognitive functioning than conventional “snapshot” clinic-based
assessments. We will also examine short- (days) and long-term (years) temporal associations between
potentially modifiable factors - physical activity, sleep, fatigue, pain, mood, and stress – and changes in
cognitive functioning. Finally, we will examine the association between cognitive functioning and other key
outcomes - social and physical functioning. This work is designed to better characterize the natural history of
cognitive dysfunction in MS, to identify factors that contribute to cognitive functioning in daily life, and to
highlight functional domains that might be impacted by changes in cognitive function. Ultimately, this work will
indicate optimal methods for assessing cognitive functioning and will guide development and testing of
preventative, compensatory, and/or restorative treatments for cognitive dysfunction in MS."
10916370,"Abstract
Diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HTN) are two prototypical vascular diseases associated with
microscopic pathological changes in retinal capillary structure. These changes ultimately lead to capillary
dysfunction, capillary closure, ischemia and vision loss. Current clinical methods and diagnostics for staging
these diseases are neither effective in detecting the earliest capillary changes nor in detecting incremental
capillary changes (improvement or worsening) in later stages of the disease. For example, clinical detection of
capillary loss is generally not possible by clinical examination alone. Fluorescein angiography (FA) is an
invasive test that has been traditionally used to assess retinal perfusion but human studies show that the
resolution and technical limitations of FA is only effective in detecting capillary loss after ~50% or more of
capillaries are already non-perfused. In addition, FA is not clinically indicated unless there are already clinical
signs of late stage disease and neovascularization. Therefore, reliably detecting and characterizing subclinical
retinal capillary changes in DM and HTN represents an important opportunity to decrease disease burden and
cost by enabling early diagnosis, clinical trials and interventions before irreversible tissue damage. Optical
coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a safe, non-invasive and FDA approved method that provides a
unique opportunity to achieve these goals. Our group of physicians, scientists and engineers have been
pioneers in the development and application of OCTA technology. In this proposal, we seek to shift the current
research and clinical practice paradigms in assessment of retinal vascular disease by utilizing cutting-edge
commercially available OCTA technology and novel image acquisition methods to identify and measure
subclinical changes in capillary structure and function. Our preliminary data shows that subclinical capillary
loss occurs in all stages of DR. In this proposal we will (1) further characterize capillary changes in well
controlled, non-interventional clinical trial of human subjects across race, age, gender and other possible
confounding variables by taking advantage of well-characterized subjects from NIH-funded population based
studies. (2) Assess the feasibility and reliability of novel OCTA measures of retinal capillary function. (3) To
further characterize the magnitude and physiological relevance of these capillary changes we will use a custom
built functional swept-source OCTA (FOCTA) to assess real time and in vivo retinal vascular responses during
a focal physiologic light stimulus. The successful outcome of this proposal will develop and implement novel
SD- and SS-OCTA based technology in human subjects to identify novel biomarkers of capillary loss or closure
in DM and HTN. Application of these biomarkers will improve the diagnosis and management of disease by
allowing direct evaluation of capillary changes and ischemia in a clinical setting. Our proposal uses spectral
domain (SD) and swept-source (SS)-OCTA devices that are FDA approved so our results will be directly
transferable to patient care."
10907584,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Human visual object recognition is remarkable in its ability to recognize individual objects in challenging
circumstances and to rapidly recognize even novel instances of tens of thousands of everyday categories.
Although a great deal is known about these processes at maturity, very little is known about their development
especially with respect to common everyday objects and the experiences that support robust object recognition
and categorization. This gap is critical because object recognition and categorization support early word
learning, physical problem solving, and the later learning of orthographies and mathematical symbols. This
research projects focuses on visual object learning in 1 year old toddlers, a developmental period that at the
front end of marked advances in visual object recognition and a period in which children with multiple risk factors
begin to fall behind the normative developmental trajectory. The approach focuses on the properties of real-
world visual experiences that support learning to recognize individual objects in challenging visual contexts and
generalizing that learning to same category members. The method uses head-mounted eye-trackers to capture
field-of-view images from 100 infants 17 to 22 months of age as they spontaneously interact and play with
objects. Through active interactions with objects infants generates their own packets of visual data for learning.
Multiple visual properties relevant to object perception will be algorithmically measured and quantified. Toddlers’
recognition of the actively-engaged object and a novel object from the same category will be measured in
challenging benchmark contexts including clutter, occlusion, and different views. Category generalization will
be measured in a name generalization task. Advanced statistics and machine learning will determine the visual
properties of self-generated experiences that support infants object recognition and categorization. The research
will provide the first characterization of the natural visual statistics of toddlers’ active interactions with objects
and potentially transformative evidence that the developmental foundation for human prowess in visual object
categorization lies not in experiences with many different instances of a single category, the standard
assumption, but in active visual experiences with individual objects. Moreover, infants at risk for Developmental
Language Delay and Autism show disruptions in early object name learning that have been recently linked to
disruptions in visual learning about objects. The project includes preliminary analyses of infants at risk in
preparation for the next step in the long-term research program."
10909240,"Chronic liver disease, primarily cirrhosis, remains the 6th leading cause of death in adults younger than 65y in
the United States. Despite advances in diagnostics and therapies, mortality in cirrhosis has not changed
significantly over the last 40y and remains a major significant public health burden. We and others have used
modeling and database evaluations to show that alcohol related liver disease (ALD) and non-alcoholic fatty
liver disease (NAFLD) are the 2 major causes of cirrhosis in the United States. Treating the underlying etiology
of cirrhosis may help fibrosis regress but whether cirrhosis is reversible is not yet established. Whether fibrosis
progresses once a diagnosis of cirrhosis is established and if such a progression is related to decompensation
or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are also not known. Of the various complications of cirrhosis, sarcopenia
and physical frailty due to impaired contractile function are frequent, progressive and adversely impact clinical
outcomes. Despite the high clinical significance, there are no prospective studies on development, progression
and predictors of sarcopenia and frailty in cirrhosis. Co-morbidities especially infection with human immune-
deficiency virus (HIV) places patients with cirrhosis at high risk of progression of fibrosis, decompensation, and
sarcopenia/frailty syndrome. The gut microbiome and their metabolites (xenometabolites) play a mechanistic
role in hepatic injury and complications of cirrhosis including HCC and sarcopenia but there are very limited
prospective studies in human patients. Most studies on the progression, long term complications, impact of co-
morbidities and outcomes in cirrhosis are cross-sectional, have small number of subjects, and do not translate
advances in mechanistic understanding of development of cirrhosis or its complications into clinical practice.
Therefore, prospective studies in well characterized cirrhosis are critical to develop effective management
strategies and improve outcomes. There is increasing interest in the use of statins in the management of
cirrhosis due to anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects that may prevent decompensation and HCC. The
Cleveland Clinic Health System is one of the largest clinical programs with a large population of patients with
cirrhosis who are referred for long-term management including liver transplantation, because of our expertise
in innovative approaches to patient care including televisits and applications of digital health incorporated into
integrated electronic medical records. In response to the RFA PAR DK-20-003, we propose to be a part of a
Liver Cirrhosis Network to establish a longitudinal cohort of patients with cirrhosis, primarily alcohol related and
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease with co-morbidities including HIV infection. We will develop a database of well
characterized patients and a biorepository from these patients to advance our mechanistic understanding of
progression of cirrhosis, development of complications and identify novel biomarkers and therapies to improve
clinical outcomes. We will also conduct a prospective randomized clinical trial using simvastatin/placebo in well
characterized patients with cirrhosis as part of the network to determine clinical responses and safety."
10828322,"Project Summary
The selective activation and functionalization of C–H bonds is one of the most important and challenging
chemical transformations. The ability to activate any targeted C–H bond in a given molecule would immensely
expand the scope of synthetically accessible chemical transformations and would be a powerful method of late-
stage functionalization of complex molecules such pharmaceuticals, natural products, and commodity chemicals.
Furthermore, carrying out these reactions using abundant, non-toxic catalysts and renewable energy sources
(e.g., solar energy) is critical for the development of sustainable chemical processes. Achieving selectivity in C–
H activation is often difficult due to the presence of numerous C–H bonds of similar strength in a given molecule.
Even more challenging is discriminately functionalizing strong C–H bonds in proximity to weaker C–H bonds.
Selectivity for C–H activation is often dictated by properties of the substrate, and in such cases, reactivity may
be limited to the weakest or most acidic C–H bond. However, catalyst-control of selectivity, wherein the structure
of the H-atom abstractor dictates selectivity, offers a powerful method of predictably introducing chemical
diversity from hydrocarbon feedstocks. Amidyl radicals are potent H-atom abstractors (BDE(N–H) > 100 kcal
mol-1) that are capable of cleaving strong C–H bonds, but their applications in intermolecular C–H activation
reactions often rely on pre-functionalized amidyl sources, rendering them stoichiometric reagents. The direct
activation of amide N–H bonds to generate amidyl radicals would provide catalytic access to these reactive
intermediates and would dramatically improve their utility in C–H functionalization reactions. This proposed
research strategy aims to develop new electro- and photocatalytic methods for direct N–H bond activation via
proton-coupled electron transfer to generate amidyl radicals for selective C–H activation. By exploiting these
modes of N–H bond activation in sterically shielded amide catalysts, the steric pressures imposed the amidyl
radicals can dictate site-selectivity. A combination of electrochemical kinetics and photophysical studies,
including time-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy and photocrystallography, will be employed to
delineate the key structural and electronic features that govern selectivity. Overall, these studies will expand our
ability to perform catalytic, site-selective C–H functionalization reactivity using sustainable energy sources."
10888901,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic pain (CP), a highly prevalent, costly, and disabling biopsychosocial condition, is being increasingly
addressed with cognitive behavioral interventions such as Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) and
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). Such interventions seek to maximize physical, social, and occupational
functioning by changing how one manages pain via addressing pain-related thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors.
The current CP literature is limited by the use of between-subject designs and self-report measures that lack
ecological validity and may be subject to bias. One component of function, physical activity, is able to be
objectively measured in an ecologically valid way using accelerometry. In fact, prior research has combined
accelerometry and pain ratings collected using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to better reflect the
real-time, real-world relationship between pain and physical activity. Such research has indicated cross-
sectionally a dynamic within-person pain-physical activity relationship. We hypothesize that this dynamic
relationship is alterable by cognitive behavioral intervention and seek to examine this research question in
Veterans with CP, as they represent an underserved and apt population for CP research given
disproportionately high rates of this condition. In Aim 1, we model the relationship between EMA-assessed
pain and objective physical activity over a 7-day baseline period, within-person, using parallel latent growth
curve modelling (LGCM). We hypothesize that at baseline, the growth trajectories of pain and physical activity
will be related such that increases in pain will be associated with decreases in physical activity. In Aim 2, we
use multigroup analysis to examine if participation in a cognitive behavioral intervention alters the relationship
between the growth trajectories of EMA pain and objective physical activity. We hypothesize that, post-
intervention, the relationship between the growth trajectories of pain and physical activity will be significantly
altered compared to baseline. In our Exploratory Aim, we conduct follow-up interviews to qualitatively explore
how treatment impacts how individuals relate to their pain. Therefore, the proposed research will examine the
relationship between pain and physical activity and if and how it changes after cognitive behavioral
intervention. The use of structural equation modelling (i.e., LGCM) and qualitative methods will be combined to
portray a more complete picture of the experience of CP and treatment. Thus, findings from this study will
address existing limitations in the understanding and conceptualization of function in CP, provide information
on how to improve function in individuals with CP, and promote the improvement and refinement of cognitive
behavioral interventions for the treatment of CP. Importantly, this project will advance the applicant’s long-term
goal of becoming an independent clinical researcher committed to applying advanced technological and
statistical tools to the improvement of treatments for CP."
10932114,"Project Summary
Worldwide, more than a third of congenital birth defects are classified as craniofacial disorders. These
disorders present diversely, from abnormal formation of facial features such as the jaw or palate, to impaired
sensory function. Despite advances in surgical reconstruction, there is still a poor understanding of the
molecular pathophysiology that underlies distinct phenotypes. Four multipotent cell lineages are the precursors
to all craniofacial cell types, forming in an anterior region of the embryo known as the neural plate border. The
central-most lineages— pre-placodal and neural crest— are especially key to craniofacial development, with
pre-placodal cells giving rise to supporting and sensorineural cell types, while neural crest cells become the
neurons and glia of the peripheral nervous system and the bones and cartilage of all facial structures. Yet
identifying the factors responsible for the initial segregation of pre-placodal and neural crest lineages has been
difficult, given that the two populations intermingle closely. This study thus aims to use a genetic lineage-
tracing approach to isolate the pre-placodal and crest lineages and investigate the roles of two candidate
molecules in pre-placodal specification. Our lab previously discovered that the Foxi3 transcription factor is
transiently expressed in border cells and that genetic deletion of Foxi3 primarily affects placode-derived
structures, including loss of the inner ear. Preliminary lineage tracing with a Foxi3CreER conditional reporter
mouse line generated in the lab revealed that normal Foxi3-expressing border cells mostly become placode
derivatives, but some mutant cells take on alternative border lineage fates. From this data, we hypothesize that
Foxi3 directly specifies the pre-placodal lineage. We will test this hypothesis by further analyzing the fate of
Foxi3 mutant border cells, using lineage tracing with our Foxi3CreER mice. We will also use a single-cell
multiomic approach to assess concurrent transcriptional and epigenetic changes in Foxi3 functionally null
border cells. Extracellular signaling also influences border lineages: notably, BMP signals are known to induce
neural crest cells. Given the similar BMP levels to which crest and pre-placodal cells are exposed, we
hypothesize that BMP also affects placode cell specification. We will test this hypothesis by an in vivo, genetic
manipulation of BMP targeted to pre-placodal (Foxi3CreER) versus crest (Zic5CreER) border cells. Our work
introduces the first method to isolate and study the mammalian pre-placodal lineage and will shed light on
critical factors that direct neural plate border cell fate. We will also gain insight to molecular changes that
facilitate fate transitions at the border, with the potential to identify genes whose mutation could result in
specific kinds of disruption to craniofacial development."
10900443,"Project Summary: Age-related disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) present urgent issues to the aging
population. Given the lack of universally effective treatments, novel approaches must be developed to reduce
the impact of aging, the greatest risk factor for development of AD. Recent work has shown rejuvenation of age-
sensitive organs, including the brain, through exposure to young blood. Our lab identified a loss of tissue
inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 (TIMP2) expression with age, and its restoration is critical in mediating the
rejuvenating effects of young blood in aged animals. Despite these findings, the precise mechanism and cellular
targets of TIMP2 have yet to be identified. It is currently unknown whether the positive effects of TIMP2 in aging
generalize to the context of AD pathology. However, aging and AD present similar environmental challenges to
the brain (e.g., inflammation, cellular debris from dying cells, toxic proteins). Based on the role of microglia in
rapidly responding to debris (e.g., dying cells, amyloid, etc), we hypothesize that TIMP2 modulates microglial
function. Consistent with this hypothesis, we have found that treatment with TIMP2 reduces microglial activation
in the aged brain. Upon exposure to the debris of aging and AD, a subset of microglia acquires a disease-
associated microglia (DAM) phenotype to respond to these challenges. This phenotype is initially protective by
allowing microglia to effectively respond to environmental challenges, but unbridled activation can cause
dysfunction or senescence of microglia and damage to surrounding tissue. Restoration of an effective response
to debris may be critical to limit pathology. TIMP2 has been found to be a marker of the DAM transcriptional
profile, and our preliminary data indicate that cell-intrinsic TIMP2 can regulate microglial state. This proposal
aims to characterize microglial response to TIMP2 treatment and the cell-intrinsic role of microglial TIMP2 in
enabling an effective response to debris in differing pathological contexts. Aim 1 will assess the morphological
and inflammatory responses of microglia following treatment with TIMP2 in aged and AD pathological contexts
to determine how microglia respond to damage following treatment. Furthermore, we will examine microglial-
neuronal interactions in hippocampus using super-resolution microscopy and RNAscope. To probe the cell-
intrinsic role of microglial TIMP2, Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that microglial TIMP2 rejuvenates response to
aging and AD-associated pathology. We developed a mouse model that allows us to conditionally delete TIMP2
within microglia in diverse contexts. Upon deletion, we will examine response to debris by analyzing changes in
pathology, morphology, cytokine release, and microglia-neuron interactions. The innovative methods employed
in this proposal will provide insights into the role of TIMP2 acting as an extracellular protein on the function of
microglia, while also probing cell-intrinsic effects of its activity in the context of debris associated with aging and
AD. Characterization of the neuroimmune response to debris in different pathological conditions may facilitate
development of therapies that slow down the aging process to limit onset of neurodegenerative diseases."
10824300,"PROJECT SUMMARY
As the state-of-the-art method to assess consumers’ preferences for new products, discrete choice experiments
(DCEs) have been increasingly applied to study the impacts of potential policies on tobacco use behaviors,
particularly in the areas of product standards and messaging development (e.g., warnings and campaigns).
Compared to observational survey data, DCEs have the advantage of providing nimble evidence on emerging
products with low prevalence and predicting the impacts of potential policies on behaviors before they are
implemented in the real world. However, their potential in guiding and defending FDA policies has not been fully
realized due to several methodological challenges. The first challenge is the lack of consistency in tobacco DCE
design and reporting. Researchers often adopt different design features (e.g., whether to include an opt-out
option) and use different measures in reporting, such as willingness to pay (WTP) vs. relative importance scores.
Therefore, it is important to review current practices, explore how to synthesize existing DCE evidence, and
propose guidelines for future DCE design and reporting. The second challenge is hypothetical bias – the bias
between stated preferences (SP) or “what people claim that they would do” and revealed preferences (RP) or
“what people actually do in the real world.” Recent method development has combined DCEs and RP data (e.g.,
retail and survey data) to mitigate hypothetical bias, providing us a unique opportunity to revisit existing DCEs
and improve their accuracy in policy impact prediction. The overarching goal of this project is to inform the
impact of FDA regulatory policies on tobacco use behaviors using existing DCE evidence. We will conduct
systematic reviews to synthesize evidence on product standards and messaging development by assessing the
ranking of policy importance and WTP. Moreover, we will combine existing DCEs with Nielsen Retail Scanner
data and nationally representative surveys to mitigate the hypothetical bias in DCEs, which improves the
accuracy of using existing data to predict the impact of potential regulatory policies that have not been
implemented yet. The specific aims are to 1) Conduct a systematic review of tobacco DCEs manipulating
product attributes. 2) Conduct a systematic review of tobacco DCEs manipulating product messaging. 3)
Combine stated-preference DCEs and revealed-preference real-world retail and survey data to predict the
impacts of FDA regulatory policies on product market shares and tobacco use. This project will provide the first
systematic review of tobacco DCEs in the context of informing FDA regulatory policies, further improving the
accuracy of DCE in predicting policy impacts. In summary, this project uses existing data to address priority

10847385,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Opioid use disorder (OUD) has proven to be a debilitating and deadly disease. Vulnerable populations
including the homeless; racial and ethnic minority groups; people in poverty; and rural residents often bear the
highest burden. Previous research suggests that localized sub-county analyses are necessary to understand
the patterns and determinants of opiate overdoses. However, most local public health departments do not have
the resources to laboriously collect, clean, and analyze the required data. We aim to provide sub-county
analyses of opioid overdose hotspots and opioid treatment deserts that will reveal actionable patterns for
California public health officials to directly address their county’s needs. Specific Aims: (1) to use
hospitalizations from 2005-2022 to detect opioid overdose hotspots using SaTScan and Bayesian spatial
modeling, (2) to use emergency medical services and treatment center location data to map opioid treatment
deserts defined by long travel times to treatment centers, and (3) to apply qualitative research methods with
county officials identifying additional local determinants of hotspots and treatment deserts not obvious from
quantitative analyses of population-level data. We will use our web platform, the Public Health Data
Ecosystem, to visualize our conclusions about the link between hotspots; treatment deserts; and the social,
economic, and environmental determinants of health. These relevant and easily comprehendible dashboards
will lend themselves directly to resource allocation, policy changes, and development of targeted interventions.
The training plan provides the skills needed for the fellowship applicant to begin a successful career as an
independent investigator in translational public health research on opioid use disorder. He will undertake
training in clinical opioid use and treatment; advanced geospatial methods and modeling; and qualitative
methods to apply and tailor research findings for public health impact. The candidate will be mentored by
faculty from across disciplines including epidemiology, psychiatry, data science, geospatial analyses, and
statistics. Dr. Nelson, the primary sponsor, leads the T32 training grant in behavioral, social, and population
health research that the candidate will continue to benefit from, and a fellow T32 director at Emory University,
Dr. Waller, will serve an important mentoring role for the application of advanced geospatial analyses. Other
mentors include leading researchers in opiate addiction from the Department of Psychiatry Drs. Humphries and
McGovern; two social epidemiology research mentors Drs. Rehkopf and Kiang; and a health psychologist
specializing in qualitative methods and citizen science Dr. King. Through this fellowship, the applicant will
advance translational methods in opioid use disorder, receive training and mentorship from world-class
sponsors and collaborators, and be prepared for independent public health research in his postdoctoral work."
10866383,"Project Summary:
 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a growing public health threat that places an immense burden on patients,
caregivers, and the economy. Despite a century of research and over 2,000 clinical trials, AD has limited
treatment options and no cure. The failure to develop effective therapeutics likely stems from an incomplete
understanding of AD etiology—highlighting the crucial need to identify and better understand modifiable disease
risk factors. Recent evidence suggests that, in addition to brain pathology, AD patients also display alterations
in the gut microbiome that may contribute to disease. Manipulation of the gut microbiome is sufficient to improve
or exacerbate AD-like symptoms and pathology in mouse models, suggesting that the microbiome may directly
contribute to disease development and progression. The mechanism by which the microbiome impacts disease
etiology is currently unknown, however, one possibility is through modulation of inflammatory responses. The
gut microbiome has been shown to influence the development and activation states of both peripheral and brain-
resident immune cells that are critical for amyloid clearance and neuronal health. However, the contribution of
individual AD-associated microbial species to neuroinflammatory and disease outcomes is unknown, and the
mechanisms of this gut-to-brain communication have yet to be explored. The present NRSA will address this
gap, determining the consequences of, and mechanisms by which, specific AD-associated gut microbes shape
neuroinflammatory and disease outcomes. Aim 1 will establish the effects of individual AD-associated gut
microbes on microglia functional state and response to stimulation (1.1). Furthermore, it will determine whether
these gut-to-brain signals are mediated by specific peripheral immune signals triggered by discrete bacterial
molecules (1.2). Aim 2 will concurrently determine the pathophysiological impacts of specific AD-associated
bacteria on disease outcomes (2.1) and evaluate whether microglia and specific bacterial inflammogens are
necessary for these effects. This innovative, interdisciplinary approach will provide key mechanistic links
between gut dysbiosis and AD outcomes. In addition, by identifying both microbe and host-derived cellular
pathways that impact disease state, it will identify novel and specific treatment targets for AD."
10911167,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Bloomer Tech is advancing development of the Bloomer Augmented Garment Platform, a wearable bra with
embedded sensors to address cardiovascular healthcare disparities in women. Cardiovascular disease is the
leading cause of death in women, resulting in nearly 315,000 deaths in the U.S. in 2020, where women generally
experience worse outcomes than men including increased disability, hospitalization, and earlier mortality.
Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is strongly recommended by the American Heart Association and the American
College of Cardiology for a variety of indications based on evidence for reduced mortality and morbidity and
increased quality of life. Unfortunately, only ~15% to 20% of eligible women participate in this life saving program,
compared to 22% to 30% of men. Critically, barriers to participation may differ between women and men and
different interventions may therefore be required to increase adherence. Research suggests that supporting
women through expanded access to safe, remote access of CR-related exercise routines holds significant
potential to improve adherence and broadly improve cardiovascular outcomes in women. Specifically for women,
there is an opportunity to increase adherence by catalyzing their motivation and increasing frequency of
reinforcing conditions that provide reassurance, supervision, and validation to her achievements in the program
and support her adherence within the care continuum. A continuous remote sensing platform that women felt
safe and comfortable in holds significant potential to promote adoption and adherence to CR. To address this
need, Bloomer Tech has developed the Bloomer Augmented Garment Platform, a female bra with embedded
textile sensors that are washable and designed specifically for collecting cardiac biomarker information from
women. Bloomer Tech has demonstrated Phase I equivalent proof-of-concept by creating an MVP software
platform, establishing device manufacturing best practices, and demonstrating reproducible sensor signal quality
in a variety of different bra sizes necessary for continuous monitoring. The goal of this project will be to
demonstrate that the Bloomer Tech Platform increases adherence to CR compared to the current standard of
care through a robust randomized clinical trial in women prescribed CR at the University of Florida Medical
Center and Lakeland Regional Health in Florida. Furthermore, the trial will assess overall participant perception
of safety and comfort using the Bloomer Tech bra. Success with these goals will support commercial adoption
by both clinicians and patients by demonstrating that patients can safely and comfortably participate in CR both
in the clinic and during at-home exercises that are not directly supervised by a clinician."
10932153,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Microglia are the long-lived resident macrophages of the brain and spinal cord, which constantly
survey the microenvironment to respond rapidly to injury and infection. Unlike neurons or other
glia, microglia are transplantable, making them ideal candidates for targeted therapies to treat
neurological diseases. A major barrier to creating and refining such treatments is an inability to
genetically engineer microglia with lentiviruses. This proposal aims to identify and overcome
microglia restriction factors to enable gene editing with lentiviruses and gain insights into
microglia-mediated antiviral immunity. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that cGAS/STING, a
known anti-viral pathway, underlies microglial viral restriction using inhibitors and transgenic
mouse microglia in vitro, with in vivo validation using a new microglia-specific Cre mouse. In Aim
2, I will perform an unbiased microglia-focused CRISPR knockout screen using newly created
AAVs with microglia tropism to discover new anti-viral pathways that prevent lentiviral infection.
Aim 2 demonstrates the first CRISPR screen in primary microglia. This Early Independence
application offers a vision for my independent research program. It is based on a platform of
microglia-based discovery tools I created over the last decade, and driven by my work as a
pediatric neurologist who cares for children with neuroimmunological conditions including
leukodystrophies and interferonopathies. It will provide new approaches to genetic targeting of
microglia for neurotherapeutics, direct testing of microglia antiviral immunity, and will influence
future directions related to the neurological sequelae of HIV latency and the pathogenesis of
neuroimmunological disease."
10931919,"Project summary: It is estimated that 40 to 50% of known enzymes can be characterized as metalloenzymes,
while currently only 7% of FDA-approved drugs in the United States target this class of protein. This is despite
the fact that there are many dozens of already identified metalloenzyme targets involved in virtually every
therapeutic area, including anti-inflammatory, antibiotics, antivirals, anticancer drugs, and more. This is in large
part because the already very difficult drug design requirement to maintain/increase the potency of an initial
ligand (drug-like molecule) while improving/maintaining its target selectivity and pharmacokinetic properties,
is made even harder by the complicated and often non-intuitive nature of metal-ligand and metal-protein
interactions. Accurate molecular modeling predictions of metalloenzyme-ligand binding affinities, then, would
be highly impactful in pharmaceutical industry drug research and development programs, because they would
allow R&D scientists to carry out computational experiments drastically reducing the number of expensive and
time-consuming bench experiments required to overcome the difficult metalloenzyme inhibitor design
challenges they face. However, currently available molecular modeling approaches are unable to make
predictions reliable enough to do this. Docking and scoring methods are able to determine, in many cases, the
pose of inhibitors in metalloenzyme active sites, but they cannot correctly rank candidate inhibitors in order of
binding affinity as they lack the required detail in their energy models. Recently, free energy-based methods have
advanced to the point of providing reliable binding affinity predictions for many non-metal protein-ligand series
and can, therefore, help speed ligand discovery efforts for these systems. They cannot provide good binding
affinities for metalloenzyme-ligand systems though, because to-date they are all entirely based on classical
forcefields, which fundamentally limits the accuracy of their descriptions of metal-ligand and metal-protein
interactions. This is due, in part, to lack of inclusion of important polarization and charge transfer effects, but it
is also because the complex electronic structure, which metals often exhibit, is intrinsically quantum mechanical.
This fast-track SBIR proposal will address this by developing a new and unique molecular modeling software
tool called Mzyme-QM-VM2, which will provide reliably accurate binding free energies for metalloenzyme-
inhibitor complexes by a novel combination of statistical mechanics and highly scalable quantum chemistry
methods. This software will be based on mining minima free energy calculation methodology and will be
developed as an extension of VeraChem's VM2 free energy software platform."
10696298,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic disease that affects nearly 25% of U.S. Veterans, a prevalence that
exceeds that among the civilian population, and represents a growing challenge to the VA healthcare system.
T2D comprises a heterogeneous set of metabolic disorders that commonly arises from obesity-associated
insulin resistance, inadequate insulin production and secretion from pancreatic islet beta cells, and
dysregulated (often increased) secretion of glucagon from pancreatic islet alpha cells that collectively lead to
hyperglycemia. Although it has been recognized for decades that diabetes is a bi-hormonal disease reflecting
pathology in both pancreatic islet beta and alpha cells, the mechanisms governing human alpha cell function in
physiological or pathological settings are virtually unknown. Therefore, discovery of molecular mechanisms
that control human alpha cell gene regulation and hormone secretion are urgently needed. Islet-enriched
transcription factors (TF) are critical regulators of alpha and beta cell development and function, with
alterations in their activity leading to diabetes. One such TF, MAFB, was shown to be compromised early on in
human islets in response to diabetes-relevant cellular stressors, including oxidative stress, high fat dietinduced
insulin resistance, and hyperglycemia. Furthermore, both type 1 diabetes and T2D are associated with
marked downregulation of MAFB expression in human alpha and beta cells, implicating compromised MAFB
activity with islet cell dysfunction. I hypothesize that MAFB is a critical regulator in human alpha cells, with its
loss contributing to dysregulated g/ucagon secretion and glucose homeostasis pathophysiologically. To test
this hypothesis, I will use genetic manipulation of MAFB levels in a human pseudoislet system combined with
advanced transplantation, functional, and transcriptomic analyses to determine how loss of MAFB impacts
human alpha cell gene regulation and function in vitro and in vivo (Aim 1 ). In addition, I will comprehensively
define the functional and molecular changes that occur in transplanted human alpha cells in vivo under
conditions of chronic insulin resistance, an acquired pathological state that impacts MAFB (Aim 2). A key
component of my strategy is use of a new transplant-tolerant glucagon knockout mouse model (i.e., GKONSG),
allowing for the first-time longitudinal examination of (patho)physiologic changes in human alpha cells
and glucagon secretion in vivo in response to conditions that mimic the genetic and metabolic milieu of human
T2D. These experiments should provide fundamental new insights into the physiologic and genetic
mechanisms controlling human alpha cell activity in healthy and diseased pancreatic islets and may lead to
new clinically actionable information to treat the underlying causes of T2D. Additionally, the structured training
and mentored research of this career development award will form a strong foundation for my independent
research program as a basic science investigator with the VA Research Service and will facilitate my efforts to
improve the health of Veterans with diabetes."
10698735,"ABSTRACT
 Multidrug resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii is a significant global health problem responsible for
approximately 2 million infections and 450,000 deaths annually worldwide. In fact, A. baumannii's most severe
infections, ventilator-associated pneumonia and septicemia, result in morbidity and mortality rates of 30-
50% with few, if any, therapeutic treatment options available. This burden has caused the Centers for Disease
Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) to designate MDR A. baumannii as critical priority
pathogen for new antimicrobial development. In response, researchers are pushing for a deeper understanding
of the mechanisms responsible for cellular adaptation, antibiotic resistance and pathogenesis.
 One major antibiotic resistance mechanism is the expression of β-lactamases. In fact, stable
overexpression of at least one β-lactamase in A. baumannii is reported in 70-98.5% of modern clinical isolates.
One of these β-lactamases, AmpC, is universally present in the chromosome of A. baumannii suggesting it may
have yet-to-be-identified cellular functions beyond antibiotic resistance. However, the cellular impact associated
with β-lactamase overexpression is not well understood and often conflicting results are reported across different
bacterial species. Some studies have implied links between antibiotic resistance, energetic cost and bacterial
fitness, whereas other publications provide evidence that β-lactamases may maintain residual peptidoglycan
crosslinking activity and contribute to cell shape maintenance. Based on current knowledge in other bacteria, I
hypothesize that overexpression of AmpC β-lactamase in A. baumannii results in collateral changes that
create new cellular vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities will result in certain genes now becoming essential
in AmpC overexpressing A. baumannii, but not in wild-type bacteria. Therefore, the identified conditionally
essential genes may represent novel antimicrobial targets which we can exploit for finding new antimicrobial
compounds and will limit off-target effects on the host microbiome. Additionally, AmpC is highly conserved in
Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae suggesting that results from this proposal may reveal broad-spectrum
antimicrobial targets and putative housekeeping functions for other MDR pathogens, such as Escherichia
coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae.
 To test this hypothesis, I propose to: (i) identify conditional essential genes in response to AmpC β-
lactamase overexpression in A. baumannii cells in vitro in human serum and in vivo in a murine pneumonia
model to identify conserved conditional essential genes and genes unique to the host infection required for AmpC
overexpression adaptation and (ii) identify small molecule inhibitors of gene products that are conditionally
essential in AmpC overexpressing A. baumannii using both whole cell and CRISPRi targeted methods to find
compounds that inhibit AmpC overexpressing A. baumannii but not wild-type A. baumannii.
 The overarching goals of this CDA-2 proposal are to: (i) illuminate the consequences of AmpC β-
lactamase overexpression on A. baumannii physiology and viability in physiological relevant conditions, (ii)
strengthen my professional and career development skills to enhance my standing in the scientific community,
and (iii) provide the foundation for independent merit review and extramural funding applications. Achievement
of these goals will fortify my career goal of becoming an independent investigator with joint appointments as a
VA Research Scientist and a Research Assistant Professor at the Emory University School of
Medicine. Moreover, the scope of this project has been designed with significant input from my mentor and
scientific advisory committee to combine my current skills with the unique expertise and resources at the Atlanta
VAMC as well as Emory University School of Medicine to advance my path toward becoming an independent
researcher."
10847420,"The placenta is one of the least understood organs of the human body. Acting as a barrier between
mother and fetus, the placenta mediates transport of oxygen, nutrients, fetal waste products and other
compounds present in maternal circulation. Full term placental explants are currently the most widely
used models for assessing transport and barrier function. Unfortunately, these models are dependent
upon the availability of fresh placentas. There is a critical need for standardized tools that quantitatively
assess placental barrier transport to enable prediction of maternal and fetal pharmacokinetics (PK) and
placental and fetal toxicity. In Phase I, we developed and demonstrated a physiologically relevant,
microfluidic model of the placental barrier, comprising the maternal vasculature, placenta and fetal
vasculature. Immortalized cytotrophoblasts were differentiated in the device into syncytiotrophoblasts,
as verified by extensive characterization. Barrier function in the model was demonstrated by showing
size-dependent permeability of compounds across the device. In parallel, we developed and validated
an in vitro model of the microfluidic device, as a first step toward development of a physiologically-
based, high-resolution model of transplacental species transport. In Phase II, we will continue to
develop and integrate our in vitro and in silico components of this tool kit. We will extend the microfluidic
model to comprise primary cells (trophoblasts and endothelial cells) and determine morphological,
genetic and phenotypic differences between it and the Phase I cell line-based model. Further, we will
test transplacental transport for a panel of compounds including xenobiotics, endogenous molecules,
lipids, antibodies and toxins, for thorough evaluation of barrier function and replication of species
transport in vivo. In parallel, we will develop a physiologically-based (PB), high-resolution model of the
placenta to support mechanistic modeling of transplacental species transport. This model will be
integrated with maternal and fetal PBPK models to enable prediction of maternal and fetal PK. Data
obtained from in vitro experiments will be used to characterize drug transport at the level of the whole
placenta using the integrated toolkit. The computational model will account for passive and active
transport. The development of this platform will aide in the prediction of chemicals’ negative health
effects in humans and address key limitations of current in vitro barrier test systems. A multidisciplinary
team with expertise in microfluidic cell-based assays and placental biology has been assembled for the
successful completion of the proposed project. By providing a more realistic representation of the
placental barrier both in vitro and in silico, the toolkit promises to establish a new paradigm for
assessment of the placenta as a barrier."
10698744,"Ischemic stroke (or Stroke) is one of the major causes of death and disability in our Veterans, and a huge
economic burden in the U.S. While Veterans in all age groups are affected by stroke, recent studies suggest that
the prevalence of stroke is higher in middle-aged Veterans returning from combat. The most common artery that
is blocked and causes stroke is the middle cerebral artery (MCA). Blockade of MCA causes ischemia that affects
major brain regions, including cortex, striatum and hippocampus. While patients suffering from stroke display
multitude of symptoms, including hemiplegia or hemiparesis, dysphagia, cognitive impairments, the most
persistent and debilitating symptoms observed in stroke patients are sleep disturbances, including insomnia,
excessive daytime sleepiness and reduced REM sleep. In addition, these sleep disturbances are associated with
worse motor outcomes and slower functional recovery post-stroke. In contrast, attenuation of sleep disturbances
in stroke patients is associated with faster recovery and promotes neurorehabilitation. Overall, sleep
disturbances are unique, novel, and modifiable treatment target that can potentially improve outcomes in stroke
patients, provided that we understand the neuroanatomical substrates responsible for sleep disturbances.
However, the paucity of animal models mimicking sleep disturbances in human stroke is the major limiting factor.
Development of appropriate animal models will enhance our understanding towards the underlying sleep-wake
substrates and mechanisms affected by stroke and help in the development of novel and targeted therapeutic
strategies to treat sleep disturbances and accelerate recovery and rehabilitation post-stroke.
Recently, we have observed that 1h of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in middle-aged (9 - 12 months)
C57BL/6J mice mimics major symptoms of human stroke including altered sleep-wake rhythm along with
sensorimotor and cognitive deficits. We propose to use this mouse model along with a combination of
multidisciplinary approaches, such as behavioral (sleep deprivation), pharmacological (orexin receptor
antagonist) and novel non-traditional (Designer Receptor Exclusively Activated by Designer Drug; DREADD), to
test our hypothesis “Stroke disrupts sleep homeostasis and circadian processes to cause chronic sleep
disturbances that are responsible for preventing post-stroke recovery and rehabilitation.”
Two aims are designed:
Aim 1: proposes that stroke in mice will disrupt sleep homeostasis and altered circadian genes expression in
select brain regions (but not in suprachiasmatic nucleus) to cause circadian desynchrony resulting in a) sleep
disturbances observed in human stroke patients as evident by excessive daytime sleepiness during the active
(dark) period coupled with insomnia-like symptoms (reduced quality and quantity of sleep) and reduced REM
sleep during the light (sleep) period, b) sensorimotor, memory and cognitive deficits and c) altered synaptic
plasticity and inflammation in the affected brain regions (cortex, striatum and hippocampus).
Aim 2: proposes that correcting sleep deficits via sleep restriction (similar to cognitive behavioral therapy for
insomnia in clinics), administration of orexin antagonist (FDA approved) and DREADD-induced activation of
melanin concentrating hormones-containing neurons (novel non-traditional techniques) will accelerate stroke
recovery.
Overall, our project is innovative, translational and relevant to VA care and mission."
10889097,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The goal of this Phase II SBIR program is to advance the commercialization of a serological diagnostic test
for hepcidin, the hormone master regulator of iron metabolism that is now the target of several therapeutics in
advanced stages of clinical testing. Hepcidin is produced in response to elevated systemic iron levels and
subsequently blocks dietary iron absorption. The hormone triggers the ubiquitylation of the iron transporter
protein ferroportin, thereby reducing both cellular uptake and efflux of iron and encouraging its systemic
clearance until reaching a healthy equilibrium. Hepcidin's function is at the center of inherited iron metabolism
disorders including hemochromatosis and -thalassemia, rendering it an intriguing target for new drug
development efforts. Antisense oligonucleotides, siRNAs, and small molecules targeting hepcidin regulators
are currently in clinical trials to modulate hepcidin expression to ameliorate both iron overload and anemia in
various clinical indications. An acute need for hepcidin diagnostic tests has therefore emerged, and once
available, would likely be used by clinicians as not only a companion diagnostic for these next generation
therapeutics, but also monitoring tools for patients with iron dysregulation and hematopoietic disorders.
Currently there is no FDA-approved diagnostic test for quantifying hepcidin in patients, largely due to the
hormone's low antigenicity and the presence of multiple isoforms, many of which are inactive and therefore
clinically irrelevant. Affinergy has developed a unique peptide-based sandwich assay that will enable
frequent, simple, and affordable monitoring of bioactive hepcidin-25 levels in plasma. Through a
previously funded Phase I program and further internal development, Affinergy has used its core competency,
phage display biopanning, to identify proprietary hepcidin-binding peptides (HBPs), unique in both sequence
and structure, that specifically recognize hepcidin. Further phage display biopanning has identified a phage
which uniquely recognizes the HBP-hepcidin-25 complex at nanomolar concentrations. Plate-based assays
using these reagents revealed a lower-limit of detection of 4 nM, consistent with the low end of normal hepcidin
levels which is generally reported as 15 ng/mL or 5 nM. The sensitivity and accuracy of the assay was shown
to strongly correlate with mass spectrometry-based detection of hepcidin-25. Based on these data, the Phase
II program will focus on optimizing a peptide-based assay, scaling up manufacturing of these proprietary
reagents, testing for the impact of contaminants (medications, common toxicants, etc.) on assay performance,
and validating the assay prior to assembling a de novo 510(k) premarketing clearance application for
submission to the FDA."
10913343,"We seek to understand how the process of transthyretin (TTR) aggregation, and which aggregate structures
lead to the dysfunction and ultimately the death of post-mitotic tissue in the TTR amyloid diseases.
Understanding this structure-proteotoxicity relationship would enable the development of novel therapeutic
strategies, and the establishment of early diagnostic biomarkers that quantify response to therapy. A mutation
in one TTR allele results in destabilized heterotetramers comprising mutant and wild type (WT) TTR subunits
being secreted from the liver, which exhibit faster rate-limiting tetramer dissociation and monomer misfolding,
affording a spectrum of aggregate structures, including amyloid fibrils linked to autosomal dominant familial
TTR amyloid cardiomyopathy. There is also sporadic WT TTR cardiomyopathy, affecting as much as 10% of
the elderly male population. In a clinical trial assessing the potential of tafamidis (a drug that binds to and
stabilizes the native TTR tetramer preventing misfolding and aggregation of newly synthesized TTR) for
treating TTR cardiomyopathy, the amyloid load in the heart did not detectably change on the timescale of the
tafamidis clinical response, rendering it unlikely that amyloid infiltration of the heart is the main driver of
mortality. In Specific Aim 1, we will take a fresh look at the pathology of the human heart using the CLARITY
method to probe the 3D relationships between the non-native TTR structures present, the host molecules to
which the aggregates are colocalized, discern whether aggregates are inside or outside heart cells,
characterize infiltration by immune cells such as macrophages, and probe whether there are any discernable
autonomic nervous system deficiencies. Another key question is why does WT TTR aggregate? We will test
the hypothesis that a minor population of a less kinetically stable, alternatively folded TTR tetramer forms
during non-optimal cellular folding or is produced during failed lysosomal degradation, affording a TTR
tetramer that is unstable and leads to aggregation. In Specific Aim 2, we will use antibodies and peptide
probes to isolate non-native TTR from polyneuropathy patient plasma to characterize the circulating non-
native structure(s) by atomic force microscopy and cryo-electron microscopy in collaboration with the Lander
Lab, to test the hypothesis that distinct aggregate structures drive tissue tropism. We will compare the
structure of aggregates from V30M plasma (a pure polyneuropathy) vs aggregates from a pure
cardiomyopathy to assess their relative cytotoxicities to DRG neurons vs cardiomyocytes, to test the idea that
the tissue tropism of these diseases is aggregate structure-based. With the Coelho group, we will continue to
improve early polyneuropathy diagnosis by studying V30M carriers as they progress to polyneuropathy
patients using unbiased plasma proteomics. Proteomics will also be used to attempt to understand why ≈ 30%
of TTR polyneuropathy patients do not respond to any approved therapies, focusing on inflammatory and
immune-modulatory molecules and cells that may become drivers of polyneuropathy."
10911916,"Abstract
 Affecting >100,000 persons each year in the United States, primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a
common disorder that leads to significant morbidity. For PHPT patients, surgically removing the affected
parathyroid gland is the only curative option. The current state of the art is to use preoperative imaging to locate
abnormal parathyroid glands, aiming to perform a focused surgical approach that can limit unnecessary
dissection. In addition, localization can reveal abnormal locations of the parathyroid glands outside the neck
which can prevent fruitless neck exploration and guide alternative surgical approaches. Despite the progress,
current imaging techniques have several limitations on detecting small glands (especially in unusual locations)
and multiple abnormal parathyroids (occurs in 15-20% of cases). This application proposes to develop new
imaging agents that can efficiently detect parathyroid glands preoperatively, and be used intraoperatively to
guide exploration. In detail, we will construct innovative positron emission tomography (PET) agents targeting
markers specific for parathyroid glands, and PET/near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) dual modality agents that
seamlessly integrate parathyroid detection and image-guided surgery. This project is built upon our recent
advances on radiofluorination, PET probe development and dual modality imaging. In detail, calcium sensing
receptor (CSR) is a Class C G-protein coupled receptor that is highly expressed in the parathyroid gland and the
kidneys. The development of CSR-specific pharmaceuticals for imaging could potentially lead to novel PET
agents that are highly specific for parathyroid (kidneys are located far away from our area of interest, which will
not interfere with PHPT detection). The use of a dual tracer (optical and PET) would not only introduce high
sensitivity for parathyroid detection, but also facilitate subsequent gland localization during surgery. There are
three aims for this project. Aim 1 will develop PET agents for parathyroid imaging based on novel ligands of CSR.
Aim 2 will develop a robust radiofluorination method to generate 18F labeled NIRF dyes that could localize at
parathyroid gland selectively. Aim 3 will evaluate our lead agents in rodent model bearing transplanted human
hyperparathyroidism tissue. The lead agent will be further characterized in nonhuman primates.
 In our preliminary study, we have successfully introduced 18F (radio tag) into cinacalcet (a small molecule
targeting CSR) using photoredox radiofluorination. The resulting agent could be preferentially taken up by
parathyroid gland in rats. Initial study in non-human primate also suggested the great potential of using 18F-
cinacalcet for parathyroid imaging. In aim 2, we successfully generated 18F labeled NIRF dyes for specific
parathyroid and thyroid gland targeting. This approach would address the clinical need by integrating PET with
image-guided surgery. In summary, the overarching goal of this multi-disciplinary research is to develop novel
imaging agents that are highly sensitive and specific for parathyroid, which would greatly benefit the
management of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism."

health department partnerships to actualize the power of biomedical advances in HIV prevention and care for
the most vulnerable populations. Our Center evolves with each renewal – refocusing and bringing in new
collaborators to meet current HIV/AIDS scientific and public health challenges. In the next five years, guided by
the theme, Reducing HIV and Mental Health Disparities to End the HIV Epidemic (EHE), we will bring
together an expanding group of investigators and clinical and community partners working at the forefront of HIV
behavioral, social, biomedical, and implementation sciences. The renewed HIV Center will provide a rigorous,
theoretically grounded behavioral and social science foundation that catalyzes and supports robust, innovative
HIV research to maximize the benefit of biomedical advances for vulnerable US and global populations by
addressing the following three Specific Aims: (1) To advance our understanding of individual, social, and

maximum equitable public health impact; and (3) To expand the cadre of HIV researchers by engaging an
inclusive pipeline of emerging investigators – particularly those from groups under-represented in research. Our
Cores ensure methodological and theoretical rigor, rapidly respond to new trends in the epidemic, support critical
research-practice partnerships, and train new scientists. Three Research Cores will complement the
Administrative and Development Cores: (1) Statistics, Data Science, and Data Management Core, promoting
state-of-the-art approaches to study design, data science, and data analytic methods; (2) Clinical Translation

The principal investigator is a physician scientist who has contributed significant discoveries to the cancer
epigenetics field. He has published > 220 scientific papers, 130 of them in the past five years - many of them in
high profile journals, and 30 of which were cited by the Faculty of 1000. He has been continuously NCI funded
since completing his clinical training in 1997. His proposal will elucidate how B-cell lymphomas arise through
disruption of an intricate network of epigenetic mechanisms that regulate and control the humoral immune
response. In the generally accepted model for malignant transformation, somatic mutations cause normal cells
to manifest aberrant phenotypic hallmarks that define them as malignant tumor cells. However, the PI proposes
that malignant transformation occurs in a fundamentally different way in the germinal center (GC) B-cells that
give rise to follicular lymphoma (FL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL). Specifically, he notes that
upon their activation, GC B-cells surprisingly manifest many canonical cancer phenotypes (e.g. massive
proliferation, tolerating genomic instability, etc.), which enables them to undergo rapid clonal evolution and
immunoglobulin affinity maturation. Strikingly the GC reaction is a transient process after which B-cells
extinguish this “pseudo-malignant” phenotype and undergo terminal differentiation, which highlights the PIs
critical point that cancer phenotypes are not inherently irreversible. He proposes the novel hypothesis that FLs
and DLBCLs arise from a failure of the GC B-cell phenotype to resolve due to disruption in the dynamic
equilibrium between histone readers and writers. More specifically, he proposes that the immune synapse
between T-follicular helper and GC B-cells normally signals to the epigenome to re-instate the B-cell
differentiation program that is epigenetically silenced while B-cells undergo the GC reaction. He hypothesizes
that the immune synapse fails to erase GC epigenetic marks and restore B-cell epigenetic marks in the presence
of somatic mutations of the histone acetyltransferases CREBBP and EP300, and histone methyltransferases
KMT2D and EZH2, which occur early during pathogenesis in ~80% of FL and DLBCL patients suggesting that
lymphomas in essence represent uncontrolled GC reactions. Finally he predicts that FLs and DLBCLs with these
mutations can be selectively treated using epigenetic-targeted drugs that counteract the effect of these mutations
on the epigenome. This latter notion is supported for example by his finding that CREBBP mutant lymphomas
are specifically biologically dependent on HDAC3, and that HDAC3 inhibitors reverse the epigenetic,
transcriptional and biological effects of CREBBP mutation. For this research he has assembled unique and novel
technologies such as GC organoids that allow precise, temporal observation of immune synapse signaling, the
necessary genetically engineered mouse models, and extensive libraries of epigenomic profiles in primary
human and murine lymphomas. The PI has a track record of translating his findings to the clinic and this proposal
will lead to novel rationally designed clinical trials for lymphoma patients."

Louisiana Occupational Health and Injury Surveillance Program
Project Summary/Abstract
Over the past 16 years a strong occupational health surveillance program has been established in Louisiana
with the long-term objective of improving the health and well-being of Louisiana workers. Housed in the
Louisiana Department of Health, the Louisiana Occupational Health & Injury Surveillance Program
(Occupational Health Program) aims to strengthen and expand its occupational health surveillance capacity
through an Expanded Program consisting of three complementary surveillance programs that will share staff,
data sources, funding, and other resources. The Enhanced Fundamental Program will compile, analyze, and
interpret occupational health surveillance data from multiple data sources to identify trends and high-risk
occupations and industries; utilize health informatics to expand program capacity to perform occupational
health surveillance; identify, evaluate and respond to emerging and emergent occupational issues; and identify
and develop new data sources. The Fatality Assessment and Control Evaluation Program will develop,
implement, and maintain a multi-source system of work-related injury fatalities; perform select case-based
investigations to identify fatality risks; and develop recommendations to control or eliminate risks. The
Occupational Heat-Related Illness (HRI) Prevention Program will expand and maintain a multi-source
occupational HRI surveillance system of heat-related morbidity and mortality data; conduct case follow-back
investigations to capture exposure and work-related information; develop linkages between climate and health
data in partnership with climate agencies, and educate and train targeted audiences through a diverse and
established state-wide partner network. All three Occupational Health Program components will engage and
collaborate with a diverse range of local and state partners and stakeholders to develop procedures, policies,
recommendations and practices that protect workers; present findings in a variety of formats using various
communication channels; and implement an evaluation plan to determine the effectiveness and efficiency of
program activities and efforts."
10911263,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The purpose of this project is to optimize a smoking cessation program for PWH in South Africa by evaluating
the efficacy, implementation, and cost-effectiveness of evidence-based smoking cessation interventions with
demonstrated success in other low-resource settings. South Africa is home to 7.5 million people with HIV (PWH),
nearly 20% of the global burden. South Africa also has one of the highest annual tuberculosis (TB) incidences
globally (520/100,000) and an increasing burden of cardiovascular disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD). Smoking is a risk factor for TB, the leading cause of death among PWH. Further, PWH are at
high risk for other smoking-related diseases, including cardiovascular disease and pulmonary comorbidities in
addition to TB. In South Africa, tobacco smoking is prolific; we have found 52% of men and 13% of women with
HIV to be current smokers. South African policy supports screening for smoking and smoking cessation efforts
for PWH; these are included in the South African National antiretroviral therapy (ART) guidelines, the South
African STG-EML, and the South African clinical practice guidelines. Currently, screening for smoking in primary
care settings is low and delivery of smoking cessation interventions even lower. Effective strategies to support
smoking cessation among PWH are necessary to reduce the burden of HIV- and smoking-associated
comorbidities. We have found that social and interpersonal stressors and difficulty managing cravings are
barriers to cessation among PWH who smoke in South Africa. Interventions developed for low-resourced settings
often address these proximal predictors and mediators of cessation, and can be easily adapted for South Africa,
provided they result in meaningful smoking abstinence rates and are feasible to implement. We will evaluate four
evidence-based smoking cessation interventions that address these identified challenges: (1) intensive
behavioral counseling, (2) peer counseling, (3) combination nicotine replacement therapy, and (4) varenicline.
Intervention development is guided by the Multiphase Optimization Treatment Strategy (MOST), a framework
for developing, optimizing, and evaluating interventions with consideration of time and financial resources, as
well as feasibility of implementation and cost. During this optimization phase of MOST, our first aim will evaluate
the main and interaction effects of these interventions among PWH. The second aim will characterize
implementation determinants of delivery of these smoking cessation interventions using the Reach,
Effectiveness, Adoptions, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework to inform scale-up and
sustainability. The third aim will compare the costs, cost-effectiveness, and budget impact of smoking cessation
interventions implemented as a routine program. Results will inform the development of a smoking cessation
treatment package optimized for PWH engaged in the South African HIV program."
10927284,"Effective treatment of lung cancer remains a formidable clinical challenge. The advent of molecularly-
targeted therapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors has shown promise in lung cancer treatment. However,
only a subset of lung cancer patients benefit from these therapies. Further, inefficient delivery and
accumulation of anticancer drugs in tumor depots combined with dose-limiting toxicity contributes to disease
relapse, drug resistance, and metastasis culminating in patient death. As a result, the overall survival rate of
lung cancer patients is <16%. Thus, testing of new therapeutics and novel drug delivery systems that can
efficiently transport anticancer drugs to tumor depots and kill cancer cells are necessary for improving
treatment outcomes.
 In the present application, we propose testing “exosomes” as drug carriers for cancer therapy. The
exosomes derived from normal human lung fibroblast and murine fibroblast cell-derived exosomes (Exo) are
loaded with iron-oxide nanoparticles (IONP) carrying an anticancer drug [Doxorubicin (Dox), Cisplatin (CDDP)].
The release of the chemodrug from the IONP is controlled by a pH responsive linker thereby minimizing drug-
related toxicity to normal cells. Further, the drug-IONP loaded exosome is decorated with a tumor-targeted
ligand for enhancing tumor-specific drug delivery and reducing cytotoxicity to normal cells. Finally, inclusion of
IONP enables monitoring tumor growth and treatment response by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
 Pilot studies demonstrated exosomes could be successfully loaded with Dox-, and CDDP-conjugated IONP.
Further, excellent drug loading efficiency and drug release kinetics was demonstrated from the exosomes. In
vitro studies showed chemodrug-loaded exosomes exerted significant cytotoxicity towards cancer cells but not
normal cells. MRI and SQUID studies showed drug-loaded exosomes provided good contrast image without
losing the superparamagnetic properties of IONP. Furthermore, tumor-targeted (tt) exosomes directed towards
transferrin receptor (TfR) overexpressing lung cancer cells exhibited greater cytotoxicity compared to non-
targeted exosomes and accumulated in the tumor xenograft resulting in in vivo efficacy. Based on our
compelling preliminary data, we hypothesize that tt-exosomes will efficiently deliver chemotherapeutics to
tumor cells and concurrently enable measurement of treatment response by MRI with minimal toxicity to
normal cell when tested both, in vitro and in vivo. We will conduct the proposed studies under the following two
specific aims.
Aim 1a. Physico-biological characterization of tt-exosome as drug carriers for use in in vitro and in vivo studies.
Aim 1b. Determine the efficacy of tt-exosome against human and mouse lung cancer and normal cells,
spheroids and organoids in vitro.
Aim 2. Investigate the in vivo antitumor activity of tt-exosome against lung tumor models."
10918308,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cellular therapies are a cornerstone in the field of cancer immunotherapy, and many consider them the next
frontier in cancer treatment. Despite the success of adoptive cell therapies for the treatment of hematologic
cancers, the question of its effective use against solid tumors remains unresolved. The extremely complex
biology of solid tumors driven by tumor heterogeneity amongst and within patients is largely the source of failure.
New approaches are needed to inform the engineering adoptive T cells and to monitor a patient’s T cell capacity
to circumvent the multitude of barriers present in solid tumors. The ability of a cell to dynamically adjust proteome
composition is essential during stress. For that reason, protein turnover rates are optimized to balance energy-
saving stability and dynamic flexibility serving as a rapid mechanism for activation or inhibition of signaling
pathways when cells respond to environmental changes. While it is common to ask the question “how do T cells
respond to stress?” we intend to shift the paradigm to asking a fundamentally different question “how are T cells
prepared for encountering stress?” The precise set of proteins T cells depend on to ensure adequate plasticity
remains elusive. We have conceived and developed a novel integrative multi-omic technique for the analysis of
proteome turnover dynamics. This technique integrates proteome, transcriptome, and protein dynamic profiling
approaches for the identification of protein “operating points”, a measure of protein dynamic nature. We
hypothesize that the ability of a T cell to adapt, through dynamic proteome control, determines persistence and
function in solid tumors. Unveiling mechanisms that endow T cells with superior adaptability and the capacity to
overcome solid tumors will be of great clinical interest in cellular therapy development. Further, identifying new
ways to determine T cell fitness in immune monitoring will not only have implications in the treatment of cancer
but, many other immune driven conditions as well. The aims of the study are 1) Define proteome turnover
changes in response to co-stimulation and exhaustion, 2) Manipulate protein turnover rates to enhance T cell
persistence, and 3) Utilize protein turnover rate measurements in patient immune monitoring."
10914844,"PROJECT II – ABSTRACT
Globally, 85 million unintended pregnancies occur per year and more than 1 million sexually transmitted
infections (STIs) are acquired every day, emphasizing a clear unmet need for improved contraception and
protection against STIs. Currently available multipurpose prevention technology (MPT) products for women that
combine contraception and anti-HIV/STI prevention are limited to female and male condoms. The contraception
options within MPTs are dominated by hormonal methods. Given the side effects of hormonal contraceptives
and high rates of many STIs, non-hormonal MPT may be appealing for some women and would be a new and
critically needed area of innovation in the MPT development pipeline to better provide a range of options and
increase uptake. In collaboration with several university partners, the Population Council is developing a novel
30-day intravaginal ring (IVR) to prevent unintended pregnancy and STIs (herpes simplex virus, gonorrhea,
chlamydia, and possibly HIV) while promoting vaginal health. The IVR releases Copper, Zinc acetate (ZA) and
Lactide (CZL-IVR). The overarching goal of Project 2 is to complete preclinical testing for this unique
product to determine the target API release and the overall safety and efficacy of our CZL-IVR. This project
will define the critical clinical indications that we will pursue and the optimal dosing for this novel triple-API
combination. The CZL-IVR will utilize three APIs, enabling Project 2 to calibrate dosages to minimize toxicity and
maximize efficacy. The APIs are low-cost, easy-to-obtain chemicals with existing safety profiles, which will
mitigate the regulatory challenges associated with products containing multiple APIs. Project 2 includes
contraceptive and anti-STI activity testing in vitro (Aim 1) and in vivo in mice and rabbits (Aim 2);
pharmacokinetics (PK) and local toxicity studies in vivo in sheep (Aim 3); and in-depth safety/PK and anti-
bacterial vaginosis effect assessments (vaginal microbiota, transcriptome and immune mediators) in vivo in
rhesus macaques (Aim 4). This project will be closely coordinated with Project 1 to inform IVR loading and
selection of the lead IVR. Our multidisciplinary collaborative team is uniquely qualified to advance the
development of this novel MPT IVR. The CZL-IVR will address a critical gap in the non-hormonal contraceptive
landscape, fill a niche that users want and deliver an important public health intervention. While pregnancy
prevention will be the primary indication defining the regulatory approach for our CZL-IVR, the triple-active API
strategy offers broader antimicrobial benefits, distinguishes our TPP from others under development, and opens
avenues for pursuing regulatory approval for indications beyond contraception. While our ideal product will
provide protection from a broad range of STIs, the specific secondary indications we chose to pursue will be
based on our preclinical data, regulatory considerations, and advice from our advisory committees."
10914852,"PROJECT III – ABSTRACT
Women of reproductive age need multipurpose prevention technology (MPT) products to address unintended
pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) which have a significant impact on their health and well-
being. MPTs in development include intravaginal rings (IVRs), most of which contain hormones. To meet the
needs of women who want a non-hormonal method, the Population Council (PC) P50 Center will develop the
CZL-IVR, containing three active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs)—copper (C), zinc (Z), and lactide (L)—that
collectively have contraceptive, anti-STI, and anti-bacterial vaginosis activity. End-user research is critical for
designing an MPT IVR that users will find acceptable to increase the likelihood of uptake and consistent use.
The PC P50 Center Project 3 is driven by a conceptual framework informed by the Theory of Planned Behavior.
We will use novel and mixed research approaches to evaluate user-centered (e.g., attitudes, subjective norms
and perceived control over IVR use) and product-centered (e.g., physical characteristics, dosing regimen,
benefits/risks of APIs) factors influencing IVR acceptability and intention-to-use a non-hormonal MPT IVR. In
Aim 1, we will conduct a randomized, open-label, parallel group, crossover study among 60 18-49-year-old
women at Emory University (Atlanta, Georgia) who will be randomly assigned to the sequence of using four non-
medicated IVRs of differing compression strengths, across two visits. Women will respond to an IVR Acceptability
Measurement Tool (IAMT) questionnaire to assess the impact of differing compressive strengths on ease of use
(insertion/removal), sensation and involuntary expulsions during routine activities (walking, running, squatting,
etc.) when wearing each of the IVRs in a controlled setting. After using all four IVRs, women will have a semi-
structured interview with a card-sorting exercise regarding their opinions about the ideal characteristics of an
MPT IVR. In Aim 2, we will conduct an exploratory single arm, noncomparative clinical trial of a non-medicated
prototype IVR with an embedded temperature sensor among 64 18-49-year-old sexually active women at Emory
(half parous, half nulliparous) instructed to wear the IVR continuously for 30 days, including during sexual
intercourse, toileting, and menstruation. We will measure adherence to IVR use via daily text messages, a weekly
online questionnaire, and the embedded temperature sensor, which will record deviations from core body
temperature as a biomarker of adherence. We will assess acceptability with the IAMT questionnaire, expanded
to include the impact of the IVR on sexual acceptability. We will also compare temperature sensor data and self-
reports to identify the best questions for assessing adherence in future CZL-IVR trials. We will also conduct one-
on-one interviews with a subsample of women and male partners to gather in-depth opinions about IVR
acceptability. In Aim 3, via a national survey in 1,000 18-49-year-old women, we will implement a discrete choice
experiment to determine preferred product characteristics and trade-offs users would make in selecting a non-
hormonal MPT IVR and conduct a latent class analysis to identify the women most likely to use the CZL-IVR."

10908349,"An emerging understanding of the natural history of rheumatic disease where a ‘pre-disease’ state can be
identified has led to completed prevention studies in several rheumatic and autoimmune diseases (e.g. type 1
diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis), with many other trials underway. The emergence of potential prevention
strategies in rheumatic and autoimmune diseases highlights the importance of fully understanding the
mechanisms underlying the development of these diseases, from their initiation with being positive for a
predictive biomarker yet without target organ involvement through to the phase(s) of clinically-apparent disease
and extensive organ damage. Importantly, as a result of research advances over the past several years,
including a number made by members of this University of Colorado (CU) Rheumatic Disease Research
Resource Center (RDRRC) proposal, a hypothesis now exists for a key role of chronic inflammation and
dysbiosis within the mucosal immune system as a catalyst for both the initial break in self-tolerance in
asymptomatic individuals as well as a continued driver to clinical disease development and increasing target
organ damage. Exploration of this hypothesis across rheumatic and autoimmune diseases through multiple
evolving stages of disease, and the integration of multiple sites within the body (e.g. blood, mucosal sites, and
joints), requires special skill sets in study design, assessments such as subject-reported outcomes (e.g. pain,
well-being) and environmental exposures (e.g. dietary intake, tobacco use), biospecimen collection and
processing (including blood and mucosal samples), and analyses. To address these important issues, the role
of the RDRRC Resource Core 1: Population and Data Sciences is to provide advisory support for high-quality
studies in rheumatic disease as well as unique access to banked data and biospecimens as well as ‘living
biorepositories’ of informative subjects. These activities will facilitate research into the natural history of
rheumatic disease around the role of mucosal processes. Importantly, the Core’s activities are also expected to
recruit new investigators into this area by providing the support and materials necessary to facilitate their
awareness and research opportunities. In aggregate, these activities as well as the other RDRRC activities
should advance the field in terms of understanding disease pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment, as well as
actionable prevention of rheumatic disease."
10908354,"Summary: Resource Core 2: Mucosal Immunobiology Core (MIC)
Compounding evidence exists for the role of microbiota and mucosal immunology in the pathogenesis of
rheumatic diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and spondyloarthritis (SpA). The Mucosal Immunobiology
Core (MIC) aims to provide consultation, discounted services, and development of enhanced capabilities to
support the prediction and validation of mechanisms of host:microbe interactions in biospecimens of importance
to rheumatic disease pathogenesis. The MIC will facilitate collaboration between individuals with expertise in
microbiome, metabolome/lipidome, immunology, statistical data analysis, and rheumatic disease, which is
essential for conducting this multidisciplinary research. Taken together, this core will support research into
host:microbe interactions through 1) assembling individuals with diverse and complimentary expertise for
promoting team science approaches focused on mucosal phenotypes and systemic consequences; 2) educating
young investigators and those new to the field; 3) providing discounted services; and 4) novel methods
development. More specifically, the MIC will support discounted services for the characterization of the
microbiome and metabolome of biospecimens and tissues of importance in rheumatic disease pathogenesis,
including feces, sputum, oral cavity, lower respiratory tract, intestinal mucosa, and cervicovaginal mucosa. Since
challenges in data analysis can often be a bottleneck in conducting productive research in mucosal
immunobiology, the MIC will also support free and discounted services and training in integrated ‘omic data
analysis. The MIC will also support experimental validation of microbe:metabolite:immune phenotype
relationships via in vitro cell stimulations, by providing services, consultation, and support in the expansion of
anaerobic and aerobic bacteria and flow cytometry and density gradient based isolation of bacteria, and isolation
of immune cells of interest. The MIC will develop enhanced capabilities in use of RNASeq to characterize both
host and microbial gene expression simultaneously in intestinal tissue and associated multi’omic integrated data
analyses. The MIC will also develop enhanced capabilities in annotation of metabolomic data through the
creation of tissue specific databases for annotation of untargeted LC/MS data from feces and sputum samples.
Finally, the MIC will invest in developing novel methods for isolating cell populations of interest for use in in vitro
interrogations of host:microbe interactions. By integrating individuals with diverse expertise and providing
discounted services, training and support, the MIC will support both early career and established investigators
in the University of Colorado (CU) Rheumatic Disease Research Resource Center (RDRRC), as well as assist
investigators new to the field of rheumatic disease to enhance overall research implementation and productivity."

10930875,"ABSTRACT (Project 1)
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting over 10 million people world-
wide. It can be a debilitating disorder and although studied for decades the physiological changes in the basal
ganglia thalamocortical (BGTC) circuit that underlie its development remain under debate. Deep brain stimulation
(DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and internal globus pallidus (GPi) has been a highly effective therapy
for many patients with PD, however, the results have been highly variable and may be associated with cognitive
compromise in some patients. To advance DBS therapies for PD we require a deeper understanding of the local
and network-wide circuit dynamics and their relationship to motor signs and cognitive function. This
understanding will provide the rationale for optimizing STN and GPi DBS, targeting specific regions within the
STN and GPi, and development of patient-specific DBS based on the patients’ motor signs and cognitive profile.
The goals of this study are to advance our understanding of the role of BGTC (subcortical-cortical) and
cortical-cortical circuits in the development of PD, the changes that occur with DBS and L-dopa, and to
use this understanding to advance current and develop new DBS approaches for its treatment. We will
define the relationship between synchronized oscillations, coherence and connectivity within the broader BGTC
circuit (STN, GPi, sensory, motor, premotor and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices) to the development of PD motor
signs, define their role in motor performance (SA1,2), cognitive function (SA1,2,3), and corresponding changes
with DBS, L-dopa and DBS+L-dopa (SA2). By defining the strength and direction of connectivity patterns at rest
and during movement we will characterize the role of individual circuits within the BGTC network and define their
respective roles in motor performance and cognitive function paving the way for future development of
optimization algorithms for DBS that take advantage of this understanding (SA1,2,3,4). By correlating the degree
of coherence between multiple single cells and local field potential (LFP) activity we will also advance our
understanding of the role of spike-phase locking to the development of motor signs. Through high resolution
imaging techniques and parcellation analyses we will define the optimal site for DBS within the STN and GPi
(SA2,3,4) correlating motor and cognitive outcomes to biomarker activity and lead location, leading to patient-
specific DBS and development of automated programming algorithms based on each patient’s phenotype and
lead location. The proposed aims will be conducted using directional DBS leads, multiple independent current
controlled (MICC) devices, high resolution imaging and electrophysiological recordings in PD patients with
electrocorticography (ECoG) arrays undergoing microelectrode mapping (SA1,3), postoperatively in patients
with ECoG arrays and externalized leads (SA2,3), and following optimization of DBS parameters (SA4)."
10930881,"Project Summary/Abstract
A large percentage of people with Parkinson’s disease (PD) will develop debilitating levodopa-resistant
impairment in postural stability and gait disturbances, including freezing of gait, over the course of disease. Many
of these individuals will be become candidates for treatment with deep brain stimulation (DBS) due to disease
progression and adverse effects associated with prolonged use of dopamine replacement therapy. While
subthalamic nucleus (STN) and globus pallidus (GP) DBS using standard clinical targets and stimulation
parameters can be highly effective for the treatment of the cardinal motor symptoms of PD, both treatments often
fail to control levodopa-resistant motor features of PD. Previous studies, and our ongoing research, have
provided evidence that the most effective site for alleviating akinesia and bradykinesia was the
posterolaterodorsal region of the GPi, near the border between the internal and external (GPe) segments, dorsal
to the region typically targeted for GPi DBS. Moreover, DBS in this region can be effective for levodopa-resistant
motor signs. Currently, the mechanisms mediating the prokinetic effects of stimulation near the GPi-GPe border
(GPi/e-DBS) are poorly understood. The primary goal of this project is to gain a better understanding of the
pathways mediating the benefits of GPi/e-DBS on levodopa-resistant motor signs. The project will leverage
technical advances in DBS lead design that allow current steering and adjustment of electric field orientation, in
conjunction with patient-specific computational models, to tune stimulation to preferentially activate prokinetic
axonal pathways (Aims 1 and 3). In addition, we will wirelessly record local field potentials from leads chronically
implanted in people with GP DBS (Aim 2), and use wearable technology to monitor gait and mobility during
chronic stimulation in the home environment (Aim 2). Aim 1 will examine the effects of altering the orientation of
the electric field induced by GPi/e-DBS to be either parallel or orthogonal (lowest or highest net axonal activation
thresholds, repectively) to putative striato-GPi and GPe to GPi afferent pathways (prokinetic connections of the
basal ganglia). Aim 2 will use the Medtronic Percept™ PC DBS system with active sensing to study: (i) pallidal
oscillations associated with the re-emergence (wash-out) and suppression (wash-in) of gait impairment with
GPi/e-DBS, (2) the up- and down-stream effects of GP DBS on motor network activity using 3T fMRI, and (iii)
the relationship between fluctuations in gait and GP LFPs during activities of daily living (recorded over 4 weeks).
Aim 3 will examine the effects of stimulation in the associative/limbic region of the GPe on gait and postural
control with and without an increased cognitive load (dual-task). Together, these experiments will provide critical
insight into the mechanisms and effects of GPi/e-DBS on basal ganglia and cortical-subcortical circuitry and
measures of gait and postural control. This could lead to a new approach to using GP DBS to treat levodopa-
resistant motor signs of PD."
10930886,"Abstract:
Neuroanatomical studies have shown globus pallidus internus (GPi) projection neurons strongly innervate the
mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR), centromedian / parafascicular complex (CM/Pf), and lateral habenula
(LHb). Abnormal activity patterns within these pallidofugal output nuclei has been hypothesized to contribute to
several cognitive-motor signs of Parkinson's disease (PD), including levodopa-resistant gait dysfunction,
behavioral set shifting difficulties, and deficits in goal-oriented motivation, respectively. However, little is known
about the actual pathophysiological changes that occur in these nuclei with the emergence of Parkinson's
disease. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) targeting regions in and around the GPi and subthalamic nucleus (STN)
can be highly effective for treating motor signs of PD, but how such targeting affects MLR, CM/Pf, and LHb
nuclei and how those effects relate to improvement or worsening of cognitive-motor signs of PD is not well
understood. In the preclinical MPTP-treated non-human primate model of PD, Project 3 will investigate the
contribution of (1) the GPi ↔ MLR network to parkinsonian gait dysfunction, (2) the GPi → CM/Pf network to
difficulties with behavioral set shifting, and (3) the GPi → LHb network to deficits in goal-oriented motivation.
This project will leverage our capacity to perform wireless spike and LFP recordings from chronic microdrives
during untethered movement and during cognitive-motor tasks relevant to PD. The project will also develop a
novel response surface optimization algorithm that uses real-time feature assessments of spike and LFP
responses in the MLR, CM/Pf, and LHb to drive DBS targeting of the STN/lenticular fasciculus or GPe/GPi.
The settings within the multi-dimensional DBS parameter space that generate the most robust changes in
spike rate, spike pattern, spectral power, and/or information encoding within the MLR, CM/Pf, and LHb will be
tested in cognitive-motor behavioral tasks that introduce obstacles and vary levels of effort and reward. This
study will be critically important for not only better understanding the neural circuitry underlying cognitive-motor
symptoms of PD but also to refine DBS methodologies to provide more consistent clinical outcomes with DBS
therapies for PD."

Abstract
 Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic and often life-threatening multisystem autoimmune
disorder characterized by autoantibody production and immune-complex–mediated tissue damage.
Unfortunately, although efficacious in some patients, current immunotherapies, e.g., rituximab, belimumab, leave
the plasma cell factories of offending autoantibodies untouched. Furthermore, these therapies are predicated on
B-cell depletion, which is problematic from a safety standpoint. B cells are critical for generation of protective
immunity against newly emergent infections such as COVID-19 and Monkey Pox, and, for those unvaccinated,
Polio. We live is a world where pandemics caused by newly emerged pathogens is increasingly becoming the
norm. It is incumbent upon us to develop therapeutic strategies that do not render patient immunity permanently
compromised.
 We have developed an alternative, non-cell-depleting and reversible approach to B cell silencing involving
the targeting of CD79a, the transducer subunit of the B cell antigen receptor (BCR). The effects of CD79a-
targeted mAbs do not require Fc region effector functions; rather, the mAbs act as inverse agonists by
stimulating inhibitory signaling circuitry that suppresses BCR responses to antigen. Importantly,
treatment with anti-79a antibodies that lack Fc effector function also silences antibody production by
plasmablasts and plasma cells suggesting a novel, well-differentiated and lower risk approach for
therapy of SLE and other auto-inflammatory conditions. Furthermore CD79a is expressed only in B cells,
eliminating risk of off-target effects. In the murine MRL/lpr model of SLE, anti-CD79 antibodies effectively
decreased inflammation and improved animal survival, and in a collagen-induced arthritis model of rheumatoid
arthritis a single injection of antibody prevented the onset of arthritis and decreased arthritis scores until antibody
levels had waned.
 We have generated, humanized and affinity matured a monoclonal anti-human CD79a antibody, and
demonstrated that in an ADCC and C’ fixation incompetent formulation it is able to prevent development of
autoimmunity by induction of a transient and reversible state of polyclonal B cell anergy. Aided by transgenic
knock-in mice in which murine extracellular domains of CD79a or b, or both, have been replaced with human
counterparts, we now seek in AIM 1 to further define the spectrum of B cells whose activity is targeted by the
antibody, and to prolong antibody T1/2 in order to allow less frequent treatment. In AIM 2 we will determine the
ability of antibody to cure disease in the pristane-induced SLE model using our human CD79 knock-in mice. In
AIM 3 will extend these results to a huSCID model of SLE.
 We expect our anti-CD79a antibody to provide a best-in-class immunomodulatory therapeutic with a
significantly greater safety and efficacy profile than existing B cell-depleting therapies. Overall, these studies
should yield a next generation therapy for SLE and other autoimmune diseases."

Candida auris is a multidrug-resistant yeast that can cause invasive infection and death. It spreads easily
between hospitalized patients and nursing home residents. C. auris is especially hazardous to
immunosuppressed patients and those hospitalized with Covid‐19. Particularly concerning, some strains of C.
auris are resistant to all three major classes of antifungal drugs. As a result, this deadly pathogen has been
classified as an Urgent Threat by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and new antifungal drugs are
desperately needed.
 Most antifungal drugs are derived from natural compounds produced by environmental microorganisms.
However, screening for antifungals from this source has fallen into disfavor, as the readily culturable
microorganisms have been overmined. However, 99% of environmental microorganisms have never been
screened because they will not grow under normal laboratory conditions. To address this problem, we used our
iChip culturing technology to assemble a large collection of previously uncultured microorganisms. The iChip
enables microorganisms to grow in their natural environment (e.g., soils), giving them access to essential growth
factors. As a result, we screen microorganisms that are inaccessible to other drug discovery programs. We have
used the iChip technology to discover several new antibacterial compounds such as teixobactin, which is
currently in IND-enabling studies to treat drug-resistant bacterial infections. In this project we will screen our
unique microbe collection for compounds that kill C. auris.
 In preliminary studies, we screened a small number of our iChip isolates (3,000) against C. auris. From this
limited screening, we have already found five potentially novel antifungals, which we will pursue in this project.
In addition, we will screen a much larger number of our isolates (30,000) to obtain additional promising
compounds. Crude extracts will first be produced from fermentations and screened against C. auris. The
compounds producing the antifungal activity will then be isolated from the extracts to determine their chemical
novelty, potency against other important fungi (including drug-resistant strains), cytotoxicity, and frequency of
resistance. Promising compounds will then be tested in a mouse efficacy model of fungal infection (disseminated
candidiasis). Compounds that show good animal efficacy will be considered lead compounds and their full
chemical structure will be elucidated. Our goal at the end of this project is to discover 1-2 novel lead compounds
for preclinical development to combat C. auris and potentially other fungal infections."

Human genetic studies provide a powerful approach to identify genes and pathways associated with Alzheimer's
disease (AD). Apolipoprotein E isoform 4 (APOE4) is the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's
disease. Despite the strong effect of APOE4 on AD risk, a wide range of clinical outcomes exist within APOE4
carriers: some can develop cognitive impairment as early as 30 years of age while other carriers remain
cognitively normal beyond 100 years. The large range in clinical manifestation amongst APOE4 carriers suggests
that there are genetic variants that modulate APOE-associated risk. To investigate this hypothesis, we conducted
stratified genome-wide association studies of APOE4 carriers at the extremes of age at onset distribution to
identify variants that modify risk. We identified a single variant in EIF2B3 encoding the amino acid substitution
S404A as a candidate risk modifier. eIF2B3 is a subunit of eIF2B, a guanine exchange factor (GEF) for eIF2 that
is involved in translational control and the integrated stress response. Our lab has recently shown that APOE4
induces a constitutively upregulated ISR and aberrant protein translation in murine and human iPSC-derived
microglia, demonstrating that APOE4 alone can lead to increased levels of cellular stress1,2. Furthermore,
EIF2B2, another eIF2B subunit, is an AD risk gene identified in AD GWAS3. The overall goal of this proposal is
to directly test the hypothesis that EIF2B3 variants modulate APOE4-associated risk by dysregulating the ISR
and thus alter microglial cell function in the context of disease. In Aim 1, I will combine cell-free in vitro fluorescent
GEF assays and structural chemistry to determine the effects of EIF2B3S404A directly on eIF2B structural integrity
and enzymatic activity, in the absence of cellular stress. Aim 2 will determine the impact of EIF2B3S404A on
APOE4 microglia cell function in vitro using human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSCs)- derived microglia and
live-cell imaging in the context of disease-related stressors. Lastly, in Aim 3, I will employ novel
xenotransplantation methods involving direct injection of human microglia precursor cells into the mouse brain
to evaluate the effect of EIF2B3S404A on APOE4 microglia cell function in vivo and in the context of disease.
Together, the results here will confirm or refute the hypothesis that EIF2B3 variants modulate APOE4-associated
risk by altering microglial cell function. Throughout the project, I will test the efficacy of an ISR inhibitor (ISRIB)
drug at alleviating EIF2B3S404A -induced effects on EIF2B activity in vitro and in microglia in vitro and in vivo. The
work here has the potential to greatly impact public health through understanding the way in which variants affect
immune cell function and modify disease risk and by potentially identifying a novel drug for the treatment of AD.
The fellowship training plan proposed here will provide me with the technical skills, scientific knowledge, critical
thinking skills gained from Dr. Alison Goate's mentorship and the collaborative environment at the Icahn School
of Medicine at Mount Sinai at large, equipping me with the necessary skills for a successful transition to a career
as an independent scientist."
10933408,"Project Summary
Accurate shape perception is crucial to identifying and manipulating objects in our environment. Among our
senses, vision and touch are unique in that they both convey geometric shape. Although haptic and visual
sensory inputs are initially processed along distinct sensory pathways, we experience an object’s shape as a
unified, modality-independent percept. How the brain generates modality-independent representations of
shape remains unknown. Human fMRI studies have identified the lateral occipital complex (LOC) as a key area
for visuo-haptic integration, yet the low spatial resolution of fMRI has failed to reveal the neural code used for
representing object shape. To address this knowledge gap, I propose to study the representations of haptic
and visual shapes in macaque inferotemporal cortex (IT), the homologue of human LOC. Specifically, I will test
the hypothesis that macaque IT creates modality-independent representations of haptic and visual shapes. To
this end, I will record the simultaneous activity of multiple neurons in IT while macaques are exposed to objects
presented as visual images or as 3D-printed haptic objects. First, I will identify if and how IT neurons represent
haptic shapes. Second, I will explore the neural basis of visuo-haptic shape representations in IT. By
elucidating the neural mechanisms by which IT generates modality-independent shape representations, this
research will shed light on how the brain is able to recognize shapes across sensory modalities. Furthermore,
the findings of this project will support the development of next-generation neuroprosthetic implants that can
leverage both haptic and visual sensory input."
10805473,"Project Summary/Abstract
The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a bHLH-PAS protein that in vertebrate animals is a ligand-activated
transcription factor that plays essential roles in the regulation of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes and in the
mechanisms of toxicity of numerous environmental contaminants, including chlorinated dioxins such as
2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), some polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polynuclear aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs), and some emerging contaminants. The AHR is also involved in a variety of
physiological processes including development, hematopoiesis, immunity, host-microbiome interactions, and
barrier organ function. In contrast to most ligand-activated transcription factors that have narrow ligand-
specificity, the vertebrate AHR is highly promiscuous, recognizing a diverse array of chemicals. In addition to
the well-known xenobiotics, AHR ligands include dietary phytochemicals, microbiome-derived microbial
metabolites, and endogenous metabolites such as tryptophan catabolites, all of which collectively contribute to
the internal chemical exposome. A comprehensive mechanistic understanding of AHR’s role in the response to
environmental exposures has been hindered by the complexity of its physiological functions and the
bewildering diversity of its ligands. Here, we propose a set of innovative molecular studies to elucidate the
sequence-structure-function determinants of AHR ligand-dependence and the origin of its ligand diversity.
Evidence suggests that the AHR evolved from a ligand-independent (constitutively active) ancestor. The
proposed basic research will experimentally determine the evolutionary trajectory and underlying genetic and
structural mechanisms that drove the evolution of AHR ligand-dependence and promiscuity. In Aim 1, we will
establish the ligand-specificity of AHRs from present-day species through a systematic experimental
assessment of phylogenetically diverse metazoan AHRs, including new invertebrate and early vertebrate
AHRs. In Aim 2, we will use ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) to “resurrect” ancestral AHR proteins
and then determine their ligand-binding sensitivity and specificity, revealing the identities of ancestral and
derived ligands. In Aim 3, we will use phylogenetic and protein structural analysis to identify candidate
historical amino acid changes that caused the acquisition of ligand-binding and evolution of promiscuity. We
will test these hypotheses by engineering ancestral and extant proteins containing these substitutions and
experimentally assessing their function. Understanding the ancestral properties of the primordial ligand-
activated AHR and the mechanisms that drove the evolution of promiscuity will provide essential new insights
into the natural physiological ligands and biological functions of extant AHR, reveal the genetic and structural
mechanisms underlying AHR ligand recognition, and elucidate how and why AHR function is disrupted by
anthropogenic environmental contaminants."
10885008,"PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic diseases are a significant problem in aging population causing immense
economic burden to healthcare systems around the world. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of
dementia, affecting as many as 5.8 million Americans who are aged 65 and older and is the sixth leading cause of
death in the United States. As age is the greatest risk factor in developing AD, there is great interest in the possibility
of targeting AD through interventions that slow or delay aging. Calorie restriction (CR) can slow or prevent AD in
animal models, but reduced calorie diets are notoriously difficult to sustain. In this proposal, I will examine if dietary
regimens and drugs that mimic aspects of a traditional CR diet, but which are easier to adhere to, can slow or
prevent the development and progression of AD.
 Studies from the Lamming lab and others have shown that protein restriction (PR) improves many aspects
of metabolic health in both humans and mice, and extends mouse lifespan, likely in part through reducing the
activity of the amino acid sensitive kinase mechanistic Target Of Rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), which is a
key regulator of autophagy. In preliminary studies, I have found that PR reduces brain mTORC1 activity and
activates autophagy, and slows or prevents cognitive decline and the progression of AD pathology in the 3xTg
mouse model of AD. Our lab has shown that restriction of the branched chain amino acids (BCAAs; leucine,
isoleucine, valine) recapitulates the metabolic benefits of PR and extends lifespan. Defects in BCAA catabolism,
or excess dietary BCAAs, may drive the pathogenesis of AD by increasing BCAA levels in the brain, activating
mTORC1, and inhibiting autophagy. However, the role of individual BCAAs in these effects are unknown.
 I will determine the effects of restricting protein or leucine, the essential amino acid that most strong
agonizes mTORC1, on metabolic health, cognition, AD pathology, and autophagy in the APP/PS1 mouse model
of AD, which develops cognitive deficits later in life than the 3xTg mice. I will also test if reducing levels of BCAAs
via pharmacological stimulation of BCAA catabolism reduces brain levels of BCAAs, inhibiting brain mTORC1
signaling and boost autophagy, recapitulating the beneficial effects of restrictive diets. Finally, utilizing distinct
feeding regimens I will determine if prolonged daily fasting, which CR animals are subjected to in laboratory
experiments, can recapitulate the beneficial effects of a CR diet on the development and progression of AD.
 Together, these proposed aims will address long-standing questions about how dietary interventions can
affect the development and progression of AD. I will be completing this fellowship under the mentorship of my
sponsor, Dr. Dudley Lamming, an expert in aging biology, metabolism, and mTOR signaling, and my co-sponsor,
Dr. Luigi Puglielli, a world-leading expert in Alzheimer’s disease. Completing these aims and the accompanying
individualized training plan will help me develop the skills necessary to become a successful tenure track faculty
member focused on the biology of aging and Alzheimer’s disease."

The overarching goal of NCI's Pediatric In Vivo Testing Program (Ped-In Vivo-TP) is to improve outcomes of
pediatric cancer patients and to satisfy the requirements of the Research to Accelerate Cures and Equity
(RACE) for Children Act to assess the efficacy of targeted anti-cancer agents developed for adults in pediatric
contexts. To coordinate the activities of the new Ped-In Vivo-TP initiative, we have assembled a team of
investigators from The Jackson Laboratory (JAX) and Seven Bridges Genomics (SB) with unique combined
expertise and experience with in vivo cancer models, scalable cloud-based data management and analysis
systems, informatics resource development, and multi-site project coordination. Combining the complementary
strengths of JAX and SB provides the ideal foundation for a coordinating center to maximize the short- and
long-term impacts of the Pediatric In Vivo Testing Program for advancing the application of precision medicine
in pediatric oncology. We will manage a comprehensive and cohesive testing program to advance precision
medicine in pediatric oncology through effective public-private partnerships among pharmaceutical companies,
regulatory agencies, funders, and research organizations. We will achieve this goal through the following aims:
Aim 1: Establish and maintain the Pediatric In Vivo Testing Coordinating Center (PIVOT CC) to provide
administrative and logistical support for diverse stakeholders in the Pediatric in Vivo Testing Program
consortium. We will draw on our team's combined decades of experience with multi-site program
management, cancer model development, standardized testing of in vivo cancer models, data management
and analysis, and informatics resource development to ensure timely decision making, conformance to
standard protocols, resource tracking, and effective communications within the Ped-In Vivo-TP. Aim 2:
Provide data management, statistical, and bioinformatics support to ensure data security and integrity.
We will leverage existing protocols and software systems at JAX and SB to identify relevant in vivo cancer
models and to collect, analyze, and securely manage data generated from testing centers within the
consortium. We will perform statistical and bioinformatic analyses on consortium data to reliably inform the
evaluation of the efficacy of novel therapeutic agents in a pediatric oncology setting. We will develop a public-
facing data portal for sharing of data and methods with the broader scientific community. Aim 3: Provide
scientific coordination to maintain an efficient and effective preclinical testing pipeline. We will draw
from the extensive experience of our team with in vivo pharmacology and coordination of similar consortia to
manage and coordinate the testing of agents by the Ped-In Vivo-TP centers at all stages of the process, from
the identification of relevant in vivo models to the generation of final technical reports and publication of results.
We will develop, record, and track performance metrics for the consortium to inform the evaluation of the

10925267,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Fundamental to the goals of surgery are functional preservation of critical nerves and minimization of post-
operative patient morbidity. Unfortunately, inadvertent nerve injury during surgery continues to be a major cause
of post-surgical patient morbidity due to the inability of surgeons to visualize nerves during surgery. Nerve injury
is a frequent postoperative complication of minimally invasive surgeries, leading to significant patient morbidity
and long-term consequences that can include chronic pain, numbness, urinary and defecatory dysfunction,
sexual dysfunction, and paralysis. Inadvertent intraoperative ureteral injuries additionally contribute to the high
rate of postoperative complications in this patient population. Current nerve identification strategies utilize non-
quantifiable criteria such as anatomy, texture, color, and relationship to surrounding structures to distinguish
nerve or ureter from non-nerve tissues. In instances of trauma, tumor invasion, or infection, nerve identification
using the above criteria is especially challenging and often fails to prevent nerve damage. Using white light
reflectance, which is the standard mode of illumination in operating rooms, the visual difference between small
nerves and adjacent tissue can be imperceptible. There is an unmet need to improve the intraoperative
visualization of nerves and ureters to preserve their function and minimize patient morbidity following surgery.
There are currently no clinically approved agents that enhance nerve and ureter contrast in the same surgery.
Alume Biosciences has developed a first-in-class IV-administered agent for nerve visualization. This candidate,
ALM-488, is a peptide dye conjugate that binds motor, sensory, and autonomic nerves in vivo and enables nerve
visualization with high nerve to non-nerve contrast with no inherent toxicity. ALM-488 fluoresces at a wavelength
that is compatible for potential dual use with Near-infrared (NIR) tumor agents, and thus, is well suited to deliver
on the complimentary goals of enhancing tumor tissue and nerve visualization during resections. In preclinical
studies, ALM-488 labels both nerve and ureter with high selectivity, both of which can be easily visualized using
existing clinically approved endoscopes. Critically, ALM-488 has recently completed clinical testing for nerve
delineation in open head and neck surgeries, which demonstrated that ALM-488 is safe and has potential to
significantly improve intraoperative, real time nerve identification. In this Direct to Phase II SBIR, Alume
Biosciences proposes to evaluate ALM-488 for efficacy to improve nerve and ureter visualization in abdominal
laparoscopic surgeries including tumor resection using FDA cleared instrumentation. They will accomplish this
with a Phase 2 multi-center trial at the University of California San Diego Health and at Stanford University
Medical Center to 1) define the ALM-488 dose in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgeries involving dissection
of the 1) diaphragmatic hiatus (Nissen, Toupet, Heller, hiatal hernia repair) and 2) pelvic dissection for colorectal
surgery (abdominal perineal resection, rectopexy, proctectomy); and 2) evaluate ALM-488 for efficacy to improve
intraoperative nerve and ureter conspicuity. Alume anticipates that clinical translation of ALM-488 will be
transformative for minimally invasive surgeries to prevent inadvertent injury and improve post-operative patient
outcomes."
10699288,"Over the past decade splice-blocking anti-sense oligonucleotides (SBASO) have been developed and approved
for the treatment of uncommon human genetic diseases. This proposal describes a pilot study to validate the
novel approach of SBASO against a novel target, myosin phosphatase (MP), as a novel therapy for US Veterans
with hypertension (HTN) and its sequelae heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). HTN affects up
to one-half of US Veterans and despite available therapies is still not optimally controlled in ~50%, accounting
for much cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. HFpEF is increasing in prevalence but only a single therapy
was recently shown to be modestly effective. MP by de-phosphorylating myosin causes vascular smooth muscle
(VSM) relaxation; it is also the target of and integrates upstream vaso-dilator/constrictor signals thereby setting
vascular tone and controlling blood pressure (BP). MP regulatory subunit Mypt1 has an alternative exon (E24) that tunes
vascular smooth muscle sensitivity (VSM) to vasodilators (NO, ANP) signaling through cGMP. Skipping
(exclusion) of E24 from mature Mypt1 mRNA codes for an isoform containing a C-terminal leucine zipper (LZ)
motif required for cGMP-dependent kinase (PKG1 activation of MP and vasorelaxation. Inclusion of 31 nt E24
into mature Mypt1 mRNA shifts the reading frame and thus encodes an isoform of Mypt1 lacking the C-terminal
LZ motif. This isoform of MP is not activated by cGMP. In small arteries of rodents and humans ~20-40% of the
MP pool is the E24-/LZ+ isoform activated by cGMP signaling. HTN and HFpEF are driven by an imbalance of
constrictor vs dilator signals resulting in increased systemic vascular resistance to blood flow. Here we propose
to test the novel approach of treatment with SBASO to specifically suppress splicing of E24, thereby shifting
expression to the naturally occurring Mypt1 E24-/LZ+ Mypt1 isoform. This will (re)-sensitize blood vessels to
endogenous vasodilator signals (NO/ANP/cGMP) consequently lowering BP and improving blood flow in HTN
and HFPEF. In proof-of-principle experiments we used the non-translatable Cre-Lox approach to achieve the
same effect - this reduced BP in the AngII/ high salt model of HTN. Here we will test SBASOE24 against the
same target. Preliminary data shows that injection of SBASOE24 is effective in suppression of E24 splicing and
the hypertensive response to AngII. Experiments proposed here will validate efficacy of SBASOE24 in mouse
models of HTN/HFpEF thus de-risking this product for further clinical and commercial development.
Aim 1 will define the dose-response and kinetics of SBASOE24 in normal mice
Mice will be administered: a) SBASOE24 over a 100-fold dose range and inhibition of the target measured by
PCR/qPCR and Western blot; and b) administered the effective dose of 12.5 mg/kg qod x 3 and time to recovery
to baseline of Mypt1 E24+/LZ- isoform measured over the ensuing weeks-months.
Aim 2 will test SBASOE24 in the slow pressor AngII/ high salt (HS) diet model of hypertension
Mice will be administered SBASOE24 at the established effective dose of 12.5 mg/kg qod while receiving AngII
by Alzet osmotic mini-pump and HS diet. Primary endpoints are changes in blood pressure (BP) and Mypt1
isoforms; secondary endpoints include vascular function, inflammatory markers, and blood chemistries.
Aim 3 will test SBASOE24 in mouse models of HFpEF
Male and female mice will be subject to the 3-hit model of advanced age, obesity and hypertension to induce
HFpEF, and then treated with SBASOE24. Primary readouts include BP and indices of heart failure: treadmill
run time and echocardiographic parameters of diastolic function. Secondary endpoints are as in Aim 2.
This SBASO gene therapy could have significant advantages over current approaches for treating HTN/HFpEF:
precision targeting of a specific defect, effect at a terminal effector of multiple upstream signaling pathways, and
prolonged effect simplifying dosing and improving compliance. This novel SBASOE24 therapy could improve
and prolong the lives of the many US Veterans living with HTN/HFpEF."
11060671,"Abstract
Sepsis, a heterogeneous syndrome characterized by whole-body inflammation caused by the body's
response to an infection, is the most expensive and deadly condition treated in hospitals, with over 270,000
cases of sepsis-related deaths in the U.S. alone. The cornerstones of optimal sepsis care are early
recognition accompanied by appropriate antimicrobial therapy, and use of evidence-based hemodynamic
therapies such as fluid resuscitation and vasoactive medications. While data-driven approaches based on
machine learning (ML) have shown promise in finding patterns in high-dimensional clinical data to forecast
sepsis among hospitalized patients, there are no clinically validated and FDA-approved clinical decision
support (CDS) system that can reliably identify patients at risk of developing sepsis. Moreover, existing
ML-based solutions are as good as the quality of the data presented to them, and the presence of outliers
and missingness can have deleterious effects on their performance. For instance, it has been suggested
that such systems are essentially looking over clinician's shoulders-using clinical behavior as the expression
of preexisting intuition and suspicion to generate a prediction. As such, there is a critical need for sepsis
prediction tools that can effectively use the routinely collected EHR data, assess prediction confidence, and
if needed, take necessary steps to gather additional information to reduce prediction uncertainty and
improve diagnostic accuracy without significant demand on the end-users.
This project aims to assess the clinical utility, safety, and efficacy of a novel uncertainty-aware sepsis
prediction system designed and developed in collaboration between UC San Diego Health and Healcisio
Inc., a UCSD start-up focused on scalable development and commercialization of advanced analytical
systems in critically care settings. The Healcisio system is explicitly designed to improve compliance with
the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) care protocol for sepsis (the SEP1 bundle) and to
address the existing delays and variabilities in determining the sepsis onset time, so that life-saving
antibiotics and hemodynamic support can be delivered in a timely fashion. To maintain software quality
assurance a quality management system (QMS) will be developed to accompany a 510(k) FDA submission
package to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. To enhance hospital quality improvement (QI) teams’
ability to measure impact of earlier recognition and SEP-1 bundle compliance, a novel quality measure
(SEP1+) and a causal impact analysis tool is introduced. Ultimately, the novel technologies developed and
tested under this project will enhance our ability to use advanced analytics to predict adverse events,
assess patients’ response to therapy, and optimize and personalize care at the beside through a rapid-cycle
‘learning healthcare system’ framework."

ABSTRACT
 Adjunctive antithrombotic treatment with dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin + P2Y12 antagonist) plus
anticoagulant (heparin or bivalirudin) is an established treatment regimen for percutaneous coronary intervention
(PCI) patients. Despite aggressive antithrombotic therapy, myocardial perfusion after PCI remains inadequate
in many patients. Recurrent thrombosis and dose-limiting bleeding complications continue to occur in a
significant number of patients. Attempts to further improve clinical outcomes have led to the development of
more potent platelet P2Y12 inhibitors including prasugrel and ticagrelor, and direct factor Xa inhibitors,
rivaroxaban and apixaban (not approved for PCI), but increase bleeding complications. Moreover, none of the
current antithrombotics provide effective protection against coronary microvascular obstruction. This results in
microinfarcts accompanied by inflammation, which is a determinant of patient prognosis, independent from
infarct size. Clearly, the next milestones for acute AMI treatment are to break the link between antithrombotic
potency and bleeding risk and to protect the myocardium and coronary microcirculation against reperfusion injury
that causes chronic adverse left ventricle remodeling and heart failure.
 APT402 is a novel therapeutic fusion protein of an optimized human apyrase and annexin V that provides
antiplatelet, anticoagulant, and cardioprotective activities. We hypothesize that the fusion will target the
antithrombotic effect to the site of coronary thrombosis and synergistically attenuate thrombosis and reperfusion
injury with minimal bleeding risk. In a rabbit carotid artery electrical injury model, APT402 preferably bound to
the injured site and to the thrombus. Treatment with clopidogrel, ticagrelor, low molecular weight heparin, or
bivalirudin alone failed to fully prevent occlusion with significantly increased bleeding. In contrast, APT402
maintained 100% patency without increasing bleeding time, PT, or aPTT. Strikingly, APT402 more effectively
attenuated arterial thrombosis than ticagrelor plus bivalirudin. In this direct Phase II SBIR application, we propose
to determine whether acute treatment with APT402 more effectively protects microvascular circulation and
improves heart function in a clinically relevant model of thrombogenic myocardial infarction, while reducing
bleeding risks compared to ticagrelor plus heparin, the standard-of-care treatment during PCI in the
contemporary era of radial access. We have also assembled an experienced drug development team and will
advance critical activities necessary to enable IND filing.
 Specific Aim 1. Using a porcine model of thrombogenic coronary microembolization, determine whether
APT402 more effectively reduces coronary microvascular obstruction and improves LV function 60 days after
reperfusion with less bleeding compared to ticagrelor plus heparin.
 Specific Aim 2. Manufacture cGMP grade APT402.
 Specific Aim 3. Evaluate nonclinical safety of APT402.
 Successful completion of the proposed studies will strongly support IND filing and clinical trials to improve
outcomes for millions of patients with acute myocardial infarction and other thrombotic diseases."

10834830,"ABSTRACT
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is considered by the World Health Organization as one of the
greatest global threats to human health in recent times and limits achievement of several of the
Sustainable Development goals, in particular SDG3 (Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being
for all at all ages). Although the burden of AMR disproportionately affects western sub-Saharan
Africa, research capacity in the sub-region is very low and not well positioned to tackle the current
demands of the problem. There is an acute shortage of professionals in West Africa in crucial
areas that are essential to impact research, policy and disease control. There is a dearth of
expertise for an array of crucial specialization relevant to AMR such as genomics, bioinformatics
and population genetics compared to other African regions. These research capacity deficiencies
could be addressed by focusing on long-term institutional training of junior scientists locally.
However, currently, there are hardly any academic training programs in West Africa countries that
focus on AMR. The objective of the proposed training programme is to increase research into the
detection, prevention and treatment of drug-resistant infections in West Africa, expand knowledge
and skills in clinical microbiology, and help junior scientists find a viable career path in AMR
research. The long-term goal is to establish a core of West African scientists who advance the
understanding and management of AMR and to support them to be competitive in obtaining
research grants from international funding agencies such as the National Institutes of Health, USA
and The Wellcome Trust, UK."

 Rather than a homogeneous national epidemic, the HIV epidemic in the United States is a collection of diverse local
microepidemics concentrated primarily in the South, hotspot counties, and large urban centers, with fundamental differences
in health system infrastructure, funding and HIV-related laws and policies across jurisdictions. Recognizing these facts, the
US OaXQcKed WKe aPbLWLRXV µEQdLQJ WKe HIV ESLdePLc (EHE) LQLWLaWLYe LQ FebUXaU\ 2019. TKe SOaQ caOOed IRU an initial
focus on 48 counties accounting for more than 50% of all new HIV diagnoses plus Washington, DC, San Juan, Puerto Rico
and seven states with substantial rural burden to reduce new infections by 75% within 5 years and by 90% within 10 years.
These goals are now challenged by the onset of the global COVID-19 pandemic, which may have severe consequences for
people living with HIV and on HIV microepidemics across the US. Further, with widespread civil protest demanding racial
justice across the US, a value-based approach that accounts for the pervasive racial/ethnic inequities in healthcare access
and explicating key elements of the implementation process needed to reach optimal levels of service delivery are now more
critical than ever in reaching the ambitious targets of the EHE initiative.
 We propose to renew our previously-funded R01 JUaQW eQWLWOed ³Localized economic modeling for the treatment
and prevention of HIV/AIDS´ (R01-DA0041747). In this competitive renewal application, we propose an integrated set of
aims, executed in parallel, with the goal of establishing a decision-making platform that considers all strategies relevant to
communities and decision-makers in EHE-targeted jurisdictions, acknowledges COVID-19-related disruptions in access to
services, and integrates new evidence as it emerges. We propose to expand our focal set of evidence-based interventions to
Diagnose, Treat and Prevent HIV infection to also consider the potential impact of the Respond pillar of the EHE initiative;
to work with local communities and public health officials to refine and tailor our analysis to local needs and constraints;
and to extend our geographic focus to cover each of the jurisdictions targeted in phase 1 of the EHE initiative, applying a
novel approach, distributional cost-effectiveness analysis, to simultaneously maximize the impact of local HIV responses
and reduce racial/ethnic inequities in healthcare access."
10895480,"Abstract
Congenital heart disease (CHD) remains the most common congenital malformation. Therefore,
attaining a mechanistic understanding of cardiomyocyte formation is crucial for improving
outcomes to structural heart disease. Though much emphasis in the last few years has been
placed on transcription factor networks that control cardiomyocyte differentiation, these studies
have mainly focused on transcriptional activation. However, there is growing recognition that
alterations in transcriptional repression also lead to CHDs. Transcriptional repression involves
not only cardiac transcription factors but also broadly expressed multiprotein machines that
modify and remodel chromatin. Prominent among these is the Nucleosome Remodeling and
Deacetylase (NuRD) complex. In this proposal we address the role of chromodomain helicase
DNA-binding protein 4 (CHD4), the catalytic core component of the NuRD complex. The critical
nature of CHD4 is highlighted by mutations in Chd4 being causative to CHDs. The goal of the
current application is to test the central hypothesis that CHD4 functions with the NuRD complex
to regulate cardiac chromatin architecture. This will be achieved by: 1) Determine whether CHD4
both represses and activates cardiac gene expression. 2) Delineate how CHD4 and NuRD are
recruited to cardiac loci. 3) Establish how the human Chd4 missense mutations lead to cardiac
disease."
10795905,"Five to 10% of patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot (rTOF) die before age 30, but our ability to predict
which patients will experience death, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation (DVTF) is limited. The
optimal timing of pulmonary valve replacement (PVR), which may delay DVTF, is also not clear. The current
best predictors of DVTF and guidance for PVR timing rely on “traditional” measures such as right ventricular
volume and ejection fraction, which are derived from cardiac MRI (CMR). However, even the best DVTF
models have limited predictive power, and these “traditional” volumetric measures fail to predict appropriate
response to PVR for 30-40% of patients. This proposal aims to address the critical need for CMR based-
metrics that correlate with DVTF and predict response to PVR better than traditional ventricular volumetrics.
This will be accomplished through the development of ventricular deformation-, kinematic-, and geometry-
based mechanics metrics for rTOF patients from routinely acquired, standard of care CMR datasets, which
would allow rapid implementation in clinical practice. The critical need will be addressed through two Specific
Aims. Specific Aim 1: Develop and evaluate novel CMR-based predictors of clinical outcomes in patients with
rTOF. Specific Aim 2: Prospectively assess ventricular geometry-based predictors of response to pulmonary
valve replacement in rTOF patients. The rationale is that if computational modeling techniques can generate
metrics that outperform traditional markers, they can be used to change current patient management with the
eventual goal to delay DVTF. The failure to develop improved metrics will lead to continued excess mortality
and suboptimal clinical outcomes for patients with rTOF. The combination of cross-sectional and longitudinal
approaches allows a more comprehensive assessment of CMR metrics in a population where randomized
controlled trials are not feasible. This work has the potential for rapid implementation and thus to mark a
paradigm shift in the use of computational modeling in clinical cardiology.
The candidate’s career goal is to be an independent investigator leading multidisciplinary research teams to
develop new, more accurate, and easily applied outcome predictors for congenital heart disease (CHD). This
would place him at the nexus of clinical pediatric cardiology, biomedical engineering, and computer science. To
achieve this goal, he will learn about machine learning and kinematic analyses, their strengths and pitfalls, and
the data characteristics needed for these analyses. He will learn how to bring his findings to clinical practice
and design studies using the newly developed metrics. He will then design R01-funded research to
prospectively assess the performance of the ventricular mechanical metrics to guide PVR and predict DVTF.
This will all be accomplished through a dedicated, multi-disciplinary mentor/advisor team, a supportive
academic environment, and didactic and hands-on training. At the completion of this training, the applicant
plans to be a world leader in the application of advanced imaging analytics for congenital heart disease."

Gender-based violence (GBV) affects one out of three women in the world, with long-term welfare consequences
for victims and families, and indirect costs to the health sector, the legal system, and the economy. Yet there
has been little rigorous research on the efficacy of interventions that aim to reduce or prevent GBV. As a result,
policymaking has been guided by “best-practice” manuals and little robust evidence. An emerging consensus
centers on multi-level and gender transformative approaches, but there is a lack of systematic research on the
effectiveness of this approach or insight into key components of programming. The goal of this project is to
deliver new rigorous evidence to the scientific and policy community by experimentally evaluating the impact of
alternative versions of a state-run GBV intervention in Peru. Our evaluation will provide evidence on the
effectiveness of distinct program components, assess their cost-effectiveness and potential to scale, and shed
light on mechanisms underlying changes in GBV. This project takes advantage of a long-standing partnership
with the Peruvian Ministry of Women (MOW) to conduct an experimental evaluation randomized across 250
villages of Leaders in Action (LIA), the MOW’s flagship GBV program that trains local leaders on gender violence
and norms. We experimentally assess the impact of its two main components: a household-based module (HT),
consisting of household visits by trained leaders, and a group-based module (GT) with education sessions in
small gender-segregated groups organized by trained facilitators. We will cross-randomize each approach to
assess their efficiency in reducing domestic violence and changing social norms around tolerance toward
violence and gender roles. The study disentangles the impact of the two modules separately, as well as their
interaction, while explicitly addressing methodological concerns of previous studies. Reporting bias from self-
reported measures will be addressed with a fully private self-administrated instrument, and a large clustered
sample will address statistical power limitations of previous studies. In addition, comprehensive male and female
survey instruments are designed to shed light on the potential mechanisms and theoretical framework underlying
GBV. Finally, our experimental design will allow us to disentangle short and long-term effects, and the efficacy
of separate delivery modes. This is a unique opportunity to evaluate government programs to guide GBV
programming in Peru and worldwide, estimate their cost effectiveness, and bring scientific evidence on GBV
reduction and prevention. The MOW is eager to incorporate the results to its programming of the Peruvian
National Plan Against GBV. The project includes policy outreach activities to guide MOW’s policymaking through
workshops, policy briefs and capacity building sessions. We expect future research to address the accuracy of
extrapolating our findings to other Latin American countries and contrast them to experiences in Africa and Asia."
10840469,"Project Description
Adolescents in residential substance use (SU) treatment have the most serious SU disorders and the highest
rates of psychological, behavioral, legal, environmental, and vocational problems. Adolescents in residential
SU treatment are also at high risk of relapse, with follow-up studies demonstrating that 60% of discharged
adolescents relapse within 90 days. Parenting practices, including parental monitoring and parent-adolescent
communication, have been established as key predictors of adolescent SU outcomes and likelihood of relapse,
but parents are notoriously difficult to engage in adolescent SU treatment. Accordingly, there is a clear need for
effective, accessible, and scalable interventions for parents of adolescents receiving residential SU treatment.
Building upon our successful NIDA-funded R34, this study evaluates a technology-assisted parenting
intervention called Parent SMART (Substance Misuse among Adolescents in Residential Treatment), which
has evidence of high feasibility and acceptability, as well as preliminary evidence of effectiveness, as an
adjunct to short-term residential treatment as usual (TAU). Parent SMART centers around an off-the-shelf
computerized intervention, Parenting Wisely (PW), which has demonstrated robust evidence of improving
parenting skills and reducing youth behavior problems in multiple clinical trials. We conducted extensive
formative research with parents, adolescents, and residential staff to guide the development and delivery of
two highly scalable enhancements: 1) access to a state-of-the-art mobile networking app; and 2) up to four
telehealth coaching sessions to tailor PW content. Our networking app allows parents to submit questions to
an SU expert and connect with other parents of adolescents in residential SU treatment in real-time, while
reinforcing parenting skills via “Tip of the Day!” push notifications. In our pilot trial, Parent SMART was highly
feasible and acceptable, and demonstrated evidence of effectiveness in improving parental monitoring and
communication, reducing days of adolescent binge drinking and all other drug use, and reducing school-related
problems, among parents in short-term residential treatment. This R01 proposes a fully powered evaluation of
Parent SMART. Adolescent-parent dyads (n = 220 dyads; 440 in total) will be randomized to receive either
TAU only or Parent SMART + TAU. Multi-method follow-up assessments (i.e., self-report parent and
adolescent measures, parent-adolescent in vivo interaction task, 8-panel urine screens) will be conducted 6-,
12-, and 24-weeks post-discharge, to examine parenting skills, adolescent SU, and adolescent problem
behaviors. Exploratory analyses will test whether improvements in parenting skills partially mediate reductions
in adolescent SU. The proposed research has the potential to advance the field by: serving a high-need,
underserved population during a vital treatment juncture; targeting parenting practices (putative mediators) that
have been shown to predict adolescent SU outcomes; addressing barriers to accessing continuing care; and
testing a highly scalable intervention model informed by extensive formative research."
10914088,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Chimeric Antigen Receptors (CAR) are engineered receptors that direct the killing activity of T cells to targets of
interest and have had dramatic results in the treatment of B cell leukemia. However, the application of this
technology to lung tumor remains challenging in part due to inhibitory tumor microenvironments (TME). An
immunosuppressive TME is seen even at the earliest stages of human lung cancer. These tumors are infiltrated
with immunosuppressive cells including macrophages and T regulatory cells, and have a reduction in effector T
cells. Clinical trials using large doses of solid-tumor directed CAR T cells did not find clear radiographic
responses. While numerous approaches to improve CAR T cell persistence and killing of solid tumors have been
developed, to-date, it remains unclear why clinical responses to second-generation CAR T cells have not
reproduced the dramatic success seen in the treatment of B cell malignancies. Evidently, this challenge requires
mechanistic studies that are only possible in clinically meaningful solid tumor models. This proposal aims to
define the factors what have limited CAR T cell efficacy against solid tumors by building an immunocompetent
tumor model and testing novel therapeutic strategies. We propose to develop the first autochthonous solid tumor
model targeted by CAR T cells. This model will allow us to test CAR T cells on tumors that faithfully recapitulate
the immunosuppressive TME. Prior studies have suggested that radiation can alter the TME. We will use this
model to determine if and how radiotherapy can augment CAR T cell killing of solid tumors. Furthermore, recent
gene editing and delivery advances in CAR T cells have created new avenues to develop novel CAR T cell
therapies that require immunocompetent models for preclinical validation and safety testing. We will use this
platform to test different therapeutic strategies to overcome the immunosuppressive TME that include tumor-
directed radiotherapy, CAR T cell expansion, and gene editing of CAR T cells with CRISPR/Cas9 to avoid
immunosuppressive interactions or reverse them. These experiments will aid in the advancement of CAR T cell
therapy for solid tumors and provide a foundation to determine the applicability of TME-directed approaches to
other targetable solid malignancies."
10925821,"Project Summary/Abstract
Extreme heat is the leading cause of weather-related deaths in the United States (more than hurricanes and
tornadoes combined), and the heat island effect intensifies these health risks, often in low-resource urban
areas. Our research team has previously piloted heat island measurement projects for citizen science research
involving college students and as STEM learning experiences at the high school level. Through the pilot
projects, our team has identified key usability hurdles that limit the wide-spread scalability and applicability of
these activities. This SBIR Fast-Track Phase I/II proposal (called Heat Viz) aims to build and test an interactive
digital media platform to enable heat island projects to be implementable by high schools across the country.
The goal of the project is focused on improvements of four student outcomes
 1. Content knowledge of relevant disciplinary core ideas around weather, climate, biogeology, and human
 impacts on the Earth
 2. Increased proficiency with the scientific and engineering practices: planning and carrying out
 investigations, analyzing and interpreting data, and arguing from evidence
 3. Improved understanding of the health-risks of heat islands, how these are inequitably distributed among
 different groups, and what might be done to address these risks
 4. Increased student interest in STEM and efficacy about how STEM can improve the lives of themselves
 and their communities
The commercial outcome of the Heat Viz project would be to create a program that integrates sensors,
software, lesson materials, and professional development into a modular instructional unit that educators can
implement into their biology or Earth science curriculum. PocketLab will market and sell the Heat Viz program
through our online store and through our network of 30+ resellers in the US and internationally. PocketLab will
disseminate the research findings and market the Heat Viz program through our Science is Cool learning
community which has engagements with 100K+ science educators."

10914808,"Project Summary
Degraders are chemical dimerizers that recruit a target protein (TP) to an E3 Ubiquitin
(Ub) ligase. In favorable cases, this results in TP poly-Ubiquitylation and subsequent
destruction by the proteasome. Degraders are difficult to develop because of the
requirement that the degrader promote significant protein-protein interactions between
the TP and E3 Ub ligase in such a way that a TP lysine residue is placed appropriately to
attack the activated Ub molecule. Here we propose to develop a new class of degraders
that will recruit TP directly to the proteasome. We anticipate that this mechanism of
action will result in potent TP destruction without the need for Ubiquitylation, which, in
turn, will make the development of these degraders far more straightforward."
10976167,"Project Summary
Low back pain (LBP) is one of the most common reasons for physician visits in the USA. A substantial number
of chronic LBP (cLBP) patients do not adequately respond to current treatment options. Thus, the development
of new treatments for cLBP is urgently needed.
The use of imagery to treat illness, including chronic pain, is one of the oldest medical practices. Although still
under investigation, literature suggests that the brain responds to imagined experience similarly to the way it
responds to actual experience. Acupuncture is an ancient invasive therapeutic method and has been
recommended for treating cLBP by the American College of Physicians. Previous studies have shown that
both the experience of acupuncture needle stimulation and the visualization of acupuncture needle stimulation
can provoke overlapping brain activation, which suggests that visualizing or imagining acupuncture may
achieve therapeutic effects through a brain pathway similar to actual acupuncture treatment.
Combining acupuncture and imagery, the PI (co-founder of Massachusetts Neuro Technology (MNT) and a
research investigator at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH)) and his team developed a new treatment
modality, 2-dimensional (2D) video-guided acupuncture imagery treatment (2D-VGAIT). We found that 2D-
VGAIT can 1) produce an analgesic effect in healthy subjects and 2) produce comparable symptom relief to
real acupuncture after a 1-month (6 treatments) intervention in cLBP patients. Nevertheless, 2D-video is limited
in its ability to simulate real experience. Recently, Virtual Reality (VR) has drawn the attention of researchers.
Studies have shown that VR is a powerful tool for studying body representation and creating perceptual body-
ownership transfer illusions. These unique properties of VR will advance 2D-VGAIT to the next level.
Thus, the aim of this Phase I R41 (STTR) application is to develop a novel mind-body treatment modality /
system (VR-guided acupuncture imagery treatment (VRGAIT)) that leverages the power of VR, imagery, and
acupuncture to enhance the experiential simulation of video-guided acupuncture imagery and reduce chronic
low back pain. Specifically, we will first develop a functional VRGAIT system / platform (prototype) (Aim 1).
Next, we will perform a feasibility study that treats cLBP with the VRGAIT system (Aim 2). This application, if
successful, will provide a cost-effective and easily accessible treatment option for cLBP and other chronic pain
disorders, particularly for those who may have limited access to acupuncture treatment and medical care."
10933436,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
 Internalizing disorders such as major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder show marked
sex differences in prevalence, presentation, and trajectory. For example, depression and anxiety disorders are
more prevalent in females than males. The neural mechanisms underlying such sex differences, however, are
not well understood. Previous studies have suggested sex differences in internalizing symptoms may be due to
abnormalities of the default mode network (DMN), a functional network that is critical for internally-directed
cognition and emotional processes. The vast majority of studies on functional networks use methods that assume
that the DMN is in the same anatomic location in every individual. However, evidence from multiple independent
groups has recently shown that there is significant inter-individual variation in the spatial distribution of functional
networks on the anatomic cortex and that person-specific networks predict aspects of cognition and
psychopathology. We recently provided the first evidence of sex differences in such personalized functional
networks and showed that sex differences in personalized networks are greatest in the DMN. Preliminary data
demonstrate that DMN representation — a measure of normalized surface area — is greater in females.
However, it is unknown if sex differences in personalized DMNs 1) evolve during development or 2) underly sex
differences in internalizing symptoms.
 The over-arching hypothesis of this proposal is that DMN representation is greater in females, which
confers a vulnerability to internalizing symptoms. Given that these symptoms typically emerge during childhood
and adolescence, this hypothesis will be evaluated using three large developmental data resources: the Healthy
Brain Network (HBN; n=5,000), the Human Connectome Project: Development (HCP-D; n=1,300), and the
Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development Study (ABCD, n=11,572). Aim 1 will characterize developmental
sex differences in the spatial distribution of personalized functional networks, while Aim 2 will delineate how
personalized networks relates to sex differences in internalizing symptoms. Finally, Aim 3 will use baseline
variation in personalized functional networks to predict the longitudinal course of internalizing psychopathology.
 This innovative research project will establish that sex differences in personalized functional networks
underly sex differences in internalizing psychopathology. Results will help inform targeted early interventions
and trials of personalized neuromodulatory therapies. Successful completion of the proposed aims as an
independent investigator will accelerate the candidate’s ability to exert a sustained impact on the field and
advance our understanding of the contribution of sex as a biological variable to the development of internalizing
psychopathology."
10695659,"This project will explore calcium-release-activated calcium channels (CRAC) as a potential
therapeutic target in a laboratory model of traumatic brain injury (TBI). TBI is a common problem in
the Veteran and civilian populations but definitive treatments are few. Microglia are the brain’s
resident immune cell, and many studies have now shown that when activated, they contribute
negatively to neurological outcome. Thus, strategies to inhibit microglial functions could prove
therapeutic. Recent work has focused on the role of CRAC channels in inflammatory cells such as T
cells, mast cells and neutrophils, and other inflammatory conditions such as autoimmune disease and
acute pancreatitis; however, very little work has been published on CRAC channels as they pertain to
microglia or inflammation in the brain. Past work has focused on calcineurin inhibitors such as
cyclosporine A and FK 506 which act downstream of the CRAC channel, but have many off target
effects and clinical toxicities which limit their use. These CRAC channel inhibitors are already being
studied at the clinical level for other indications, and do not appear to have the same toxicities as the
CNIs. In fact, a similar inhibitor produced by the same company was recently shown to improve
outcome from severe COVID-19 pneumonia following infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and was
well tolerated in this patient population. Prior work in our lab showed that these specific CRAC
channel inhibitors block microglial activation and that at least one of these inhibitors protects the brain
from experimental TBI. This project will study CRAC channel inhibitors in a model of TBI to further
define the conditions where neuroprotection may be observed. The first Aim will determine the more
protective of two such novel CRAC channel inhibitors, and determine the optimal dosing required for
maximum neurological benefit. This aim will also validate the specificity of the inhibitors and the
expected mechanism of action of downstream calcium and inflammatory signaling. The second aim
will then determine whether treatment can be delayed by hours and still show improvement in
neurological outcomes. The third aim will then use the optimal dose and dosing regimen determined
from the first two aims to see if any benefit is long lasting. In vivo experiments will include studies in
female animals as well as comparing these novel, specific inhibitors to currently available, but less
specific inhibitors."

Genomic variation underlies almost all human disease. Technological advances have made variant detection
across the human genome commonplace in medical care, sparking an expansion of basic and clinical research.
To accurately assess the impact of any given genomic variant on human health, clinicians and researchers must
have quick, easy access to high-quality knowledge sources. Since 2013, the Clinical Genome Resource
(ClinGen) has been dedicated to creating such knowledge bases, defining the clinical relevance of genes and
variants for use in medicine and research. This proposal builds upon ClinGen’s successful foundation, using
existing tools and approaches while developing new ones, to expand and scale our efforts. We will work closely
with our colleagues submitting linked U24 grant proposals (Baylor/Stanford; University of North Carolina/Kaiser),
as our work is highly integrated and synergistic for achieving our shared goals, which are embodied by our
specific aims: 1) Develop and implement standards to support clinical annotation and interpretation of genes and
variants; 2) Share genomic and phenotypic data between clinicians, researchers, and patients through enhanced
knowledge bases for clinical and research use; 3) Enhance and accelerate expert review of the clinical relevance
of genes and variants; and 4) Disseminate and integrate ClinGen knowledge and resources to the broader
community. ClinGen’s approach to providing curated clinical genomic resources to aid the interpretation of
individual genomes involves curating genes to understand which have been validly implicated in disease (and
through what mutational mechanisms), and curating variants (and the evidence supporting claims of
pathogenicity) to identify which are causal for existing disease or predictive of risk for future disease. To address
these needs, we have organized gene and variant curation expert panels by clinical domains to curate claims of
gene-disease association and variant pathogenicity. In addition, we curate the dosage sensitivity for each gene
to aid in the interpretation of structural variants, as well as the actionability of gene-disease pairs to guide the
use of this information for determining disease risk. To support variant interpretation, we develop standards to
enable the global community to classify variants with the same rigorous standards as ClinGen. We continue to
improve global data sharing of genomic knowledge through our successful partnership with ClinVar, the National
Center for Biotechnology Information’s repository for genomic variants and their relationships to human health,
as well as through direct data sharing from patients via Genome Connect, ClinGen’s patient registry. We will
continue to solicit and support ClinVar submissions, with particular focus on global and diverse data sources,
allowing transparency, comparison of results, and crowdsourcing variant classification. Finally, we disseminate
ClinGen’s work through multiple modalities, enabling web-based and computational data access, while educating
the community on its availability and utility. ClinGen has become an invaluable community resource for
genomics; continued efforts will allow us to realize the full promise for precision medicine."

Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a rare and aggressive non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Unfortunately limited
therapies for MCL are currently available suggesting a need to further unravel molecular mechanisms
regulating transformation and progression of the disease. The majority of MCL patients have a t(11;14)
translocation leading to overexpression of CyclinD1 resulting in extensive proliferation and block in
differentiation originating in the mantle zone of the lymph node, however additional mutations are necessary for
transformation. Next generation sequencing has identified a number of novel mutations in MCL patients
including the ubiquitin E3 ligase UBR5. E3 ubiquitin ligases serve as the substrate-recognizing component for
protein degradation by the ubiquitin proteasome system. In a cohort of 196 MCL patients UBR5 was the 3rd
most frequently mutated gene and ~60% of the mutations were found within the HECT domain of UBR5, which
can accept and transfer ubiquitin molecules to the substrate. In order to understand the role of UBR5 HECT
domain in B-lymphoid development we generated a conditional mouse using novel CRISPR/Cas 9 technology.
Loss of the HECT domain leads to a block in pre-germinal center B cells in the spleen with a reduction of both
B1 and marginal B cell subsets. In addition, follicular B cells in the spleen are phenotypically abnormal and fail
to terminally differentiate to anti-body secreting plasma cells. Proteomic studies reveal up-regulation of proteins
associated with mRNA splicing via the spliceosome in B cells lacking the HECT domain of UBR5. These
studies suggest that 1) cooperation of UBR5 mutations along with expression of cyclinD1 may led to disease
progression of mantle cell lymphoma (Aim 1), 2) understanding molecular mechanism of UBR5 mutations
could provide potential therapeutic targets in MCL (Aim 2), and 3) aberrant expression of U5 spliceosome
proteins block B cell maturation and promote lymphomagenesis (Aim 3). In this application we propose studies
to understand the role of UBR5 and its interacting proteins in B-cell lymphomagenesis and define molecular
pathways regulated by UBR5 in B-cells. Our goal of the proposed studies is to provide insights to mantle cell
lymphoma transformation, progression and potential future therapeutics targets."
10815537,"Project Summary/Abstract
Total syntheses of novel azetidine-containing metabolites (azetidomonamide A, azetidopyridone, and
diazetidomonapyridone) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa do not exist, and are sorely needed so their biological
functions in quorum-sensing behavior can be evaluated. In particular, the exact mode of their production from
the non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) enzymatic cluster is unknown; furthermore, elucidating the exact
role of these metabolites in modulating quorum-sensing behavior in P. aeruginosa is not currently possible due
to the minute quantities of metabolites produced in the natural bacterial system. Additionally, these metabolites
affect overall bacterial biofilm formation and the production of redox-active metabolites, which are partially
implicated in adverse outcomes for cystic fibrosis patients infected with P. aeruginosa. Thus, total syntheses of
these metabolites are highly needed and will have a broader impact on human health through expanding our
understanding of biofilm formation by P. aeruginosa, and potentially allowing for development of anti-virulence
treatments for it in the long term.
 The studies described in this proposal seek to develop strategies for synthesis of these novel azetidine-
containing metabolites. Importantly, we propose orthogonal approaches that mitigate the risk of the overall goal
while still pushing chemical boundaries by leveraging modern chemistry in complex contexts. For the synthesis
of azetidomonamide A (Aim1), our design involves accessing and employing a unique ynamide cascade to
cyclize the system; a second approach utilizes enzymatic biocatalysis to install the alcohol stereocenter.
 For the synthesis of diazetidomonapyridone (Aim 2), we first propose strategies for accessing the
azetidopyridone precursor. The initial approach would build on existing chemistry by utilizing a Pd-catalyzed
cascade cyclization with CO in a complex setting; an alternative approach alleviates the risk of the former
approach by employing condensation reactivity to install the requisite cyclic system. To access
diazetidomonapyridone from the azetidopyridone, we envision two approaches. The first employs a biomimetic
reflection of literature precedent by directly subjecting azetidopyridone to azetidomonamide A, which undergo
spontaneous reaction under basic conditions to access the target metabolite. Additionally, we propose accessing
diazetidomonapyridone via a bio-inspired approach that leverages ring formation to control alkene geometry.
 Overall, the proposed research is significant because it provides creative strategies to establish the first
total syntheses of azetidomonamide A, azetidopyridone, which will enable their biological study. More broadly,
these strategies can be used to access similar scaffolds in other bacterial metabolites that have yet to be
synthesized. Performing this research in Prof. Reisman’s group at Caltech aligns well with their current success
in the efficient total synthesis of complex natural products and will augment my prior training in organometallic
chemistry to prepare me for a future academic career as a professor."

Stress can induce long-lasting behavioral changes that result in psychiatric illnesses, such as post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD). Some of these changes include avoidance of future situations that may be stress-
inducing or ignoring one’s own basic needs, such as eating. In mice, stress can manifest in similar ways: after
a stress-inducing experience, mice will not explore for food or eat in a novel, brightly lit environment in spite of
hunger. This phenomenon of avoidant behavior is known as novelty-suppressed feeding or hyponeophagia.
The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is a region of the extended amygdala that regulates behavioral
responses to stress. BNST neural activity is also enhanced in response to uncontrollable stress in humans.
Using a mouse model of stressor controllability, our preliminary data establishes that both GABA and
glutamate neuron activity within the BNST is increased during uncontrollable stress, extending the previously
aforementioned finding in humans to specific BNST neurons. We have also found that BNST neurons form
synapses onto key hypothalamic brain regions that play a role in feeding and stress regulation: the arcuate
nucleus (ARC) and the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH). Using RNAscope in situ
hybridization, we discovered that the majority of glutamatergic BNST neurons co-express the genetic
machinery to vesicularly package both GABA and glutamate. The goal of this proposed project is to determine
the synaptic functionality of GABA and glutamate co-transmission from BNST neurons to ARC and PVH in the
context of stress-induced avoidance. The principal hypothesis is that there is an increase in co-transmission of
GABA and glutamate after uncontrollable stress on downstream ARC and PVH neurons. Therefore, we
hypothesize that the GABA-glutamate BNST to hypothalamus pathways are necessary for uncontrollable
stress to cause avoidant behavior. A combination of optogenetics, whole-cell electrophysiology, behavioral
analyses of stress, and intersectional viral strategies will be used to target and investigate the BNST circuitry to
ARC and PVH. In Aim 1, we will evaluate stress-induced changes in GABA and glutamate release from BNST
neurons to ARC and PVH. In Aim 2, we will manipulate GABA and glutamate transmission from BNST to ARC
and PVH during uncontrollable stress and identify changes in novelty-suppressed feeding. The data generated
from this proposed project may identify novel mechanisms of neurotransmitter co-transmission that may be
used to reduce the effects of stress on avoidance."

 Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) plays a key role during ovarian follicular development. We have advanced
our understanding of the dynamic expression, direct action, and physiological role of AMH during
folliculogenesis in rhesus macaques since the initial award of the project. Data suggest that AMH is produced
heterogeneously by developing follicles and exhibits stage-dependent regulatory effects by promoting preantral
follicle growth and preventing antral follicle maturation. Stage-specific AMH modulation improves follicle growth
and maturation in vitro to generate competent oocytes. Therefore, further research is warranted to elucidate
the downstream molecular and cellular events regulated by AMH at the specific stages of follicular
development, as well as the potential for modulation of AMH actions to improve ovarian function and female
fertility. Our preliminary studies show that (a) AMH administration in vivo promotes preantral follicle growth,
resulting in the increased number of antral follicles in the ovary; (b) primordial follicle activation and growth to
the preantral stage is achieved by ovarian tissue culture after cryopreservation; and (c) preantral follicles are
maintained in a state of physiological hypoxia. AMH has the potential to regulate cell cycle progression by
limiting actions of hypoxia-inducible factor, and to control cellular energy production by inducing creatine
biosynthesis and metabolism under hypoxia. Thus, studies will be performed to test the hypothesis that stage-
specific modulation of AMH actions facilitates follicular development in vivo and in vitro, which in turn improves
fertility outcomes. Aim 1 will evaluate the impact of AMH priming on ovarian response to gonadotropin
stimulation during IVF (in vitro fertilization). AMH will be administered in vivo in macaques at advanced
reproductive age or with poor response to controlled ovarian stimulation (COS). The COS protocol will then be
performed to evaluate IVF efficacy. Aim 2 will examine the effect of AMH modulation on in vitro maturation of
follicles from cryopreserved macaque and human ovarian tissue. Vitrified-warmed ovarian cortex will be
cultured to induce primordial follicle activation and growth to the preantral stage. Preantral follicles will then be
isolated and cultured with AMH modulation for oocyte maturation. Aim 3 will determine the molecular
mechanisms whereby AMH regulates cell proliferation and energy production during follicular development.
Macaque preantral follicles will be cultured at 5% O2 with AMH supplementation or knockdown. Factors
regulating cell cycle progression and creatine biosynthesis/metabolic pathway components will be analyzed.
 The proposed studies will provide important insight into the mechanism of stage-dependent AMH actions
in regulating follicular development and ovarian function using a nonhuman primate model that is an excellent
surrogate for understanding reproductive processes in women. The findings will allow for developing protocols
for optimizing IVF process, advancing options for female fertility preservation, and defining AMH-mediated
regulation of cell cycle and energy metabolism during folliculogenesis."
10904729,"ABSTRACT
The introduction of small molecule inhibitors of kinases downstream of the B-cell receptor (BCR) or its oncogenic
mimics substantially improved outcomes for patients with B-cell malignancies. However, treatment with kinase-
inhibitors alone invariably selects for drug-resistant clones. The development of subsequent relapse remains a
central problem in the treatment of patients with B-ALL, CLL and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), which continue
to have poor outcomes or remain incurable diseases.
Over the past five years, our R35-supported research led to a new paradigm for the treatment of B-cell tumors:
Unlike other cancer-types, B-cell malignancies are highly susceptible to targeted engagement of negative
selection, a B-cell-intrinsic mechanism to protect against harmful autoantibodies and autoimmune disease.
Contrary to established dogma, mechanisms of negative selection are not only active in preventing autoimmune
disease but also represent an entirely novel class of therapeutic targets in B-cell malignancies. The main impetus
of this renewal application is now to leverage these new concepts for the development of treatment strategies
that will overcome conventional mechanisms of drug-resistance in B-ALL, CLL and MCL.
One of these approaches is based on pharmacological hyperactivation of BCR-downstream kinases to mimic
excessive signaling-strength from an autoreactive BCR. Targeted cancer-therapy is traditionally focused on
kinase-inhibitors to suppress oncogenic signaling. Our concept of kinase-hyperactivation effectively represents
the opposite.
We pursue the new paradigm that negative selection is predicated on a B-lymphoid transcriptional program to
restrict energy-abundance, a mechanism we termed `metabolic gatekeeper'. Given that transformed B-cells have
higher energy-demands than their normal counterparts, we hypothesize that metabolic gatekeeper mechanisms
to limit energy-supply will prevent B-cell transformation by setting low thresholds for elimination of pre-malignant
clones based on energy-stress.
Our laboratory recently developed genetic systems to identify factors that dictate the unique morphology of B-
cells, i.e. that B-cells have a smaller cell size and fewer mitochondria than any other somatic cell type. We
examine how maintenance of a small cell-size affects B-cell selection and how B-cells engineered to inducibly
increase cell size and mitochondrial mass become more prone to malignant transformation.
Long-term biomass-measurements of single B-cell lymphoma cells revealed periodic phases of shrinking
(quiescence, BCL6+) and expanding (proliferation, MYC+) cell mass. We will examine the new paradigm that
BCL6 and MYC mark iterative cycles of dormancy and activation. In analogy to sleep-wake phases, we
hypothesize that the quiescent BCL6-phase is essential for recovery and regeneration. These and other
observations will lead to new concepts for the understanding of how cell-size and the length of recovery-periods
regulate energy-supply and survival of transformed B-cells and create new opportunities for therapeutic
intervention in B-cell malignancies with a focus on B-ALL, CLL and MCL."

Despite advances in the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV), the number of liver disease-related deaths has
increased annually since 2009 due to: 1) liver disease from non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and alcohol-
induced liver disease; and 2) mortality from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The time course to progress from
compensated to decompensated cirrhosis varies based on many factors, such as race/ethnicity, etiology of
liver disease, and medical co-morbidities. Hispanics have the highest age-adjusted cirrhosis mortality rates yet
are underrepresented in the largest US cirrhosis cohort studies. To disentangle whether disparities for
underrepresented populations are due to biological, cultural, and/or socioeconomic factors requires a
prospective study in a racially and ethnically diverse population. Given that genetic variants may be associated
with cirrhosis-related complications and the frequency of these variants likely differ across populations,
analyses cannot simply focus on self-reported race/ethnicity, but rather must incorporate genetic ancestry
information due to the variable genetic admixture of the US population. Another population that has been
shown to have increased risk of hepatic decompensation, and worse survival are HIV-infected patients.
However, these data have been largely restricted to patients with HIV and viral hepatitis. In addition to
identifying the trajectory of compensated cirrhosis, there is a need to identify therapeutics to slow progression.
There are several lines of evidence to suggest that statins slow cirrhosis progression and/or decrease the risk
of decompensation. There are genetic variants/haplotypes in HMGCR associated with clinical responses to
statins that are more prevalent in certain racial/ethnic groups. How these genetic variants might impact the
response to statin therapy among patients with cirrhosis is unknown, and data from other populations may not
apply due to the diversity of the US population. This underscores the need to establish the safety and efficacy
of statins to prevent hepatic decompensation in a US population, and to assess if there are variable responses
to statin therapy that depend in part on underlying genetic variation. Our overarching goal is to develop a
longitudinal prospective cohort study of patients with compensated cirrhosis to assess trajectories of hepatic
stiffness and time to hepatic decompensation. We will enroll a subset with clinically significant portal
hypertension in a randomized controlled trial of simvastatin. By targeting a racially and ethnically diverse cohort
of patients with cirrhosis, with targeted enrollment of patients with HIV, we seek to address these aims to: 1)
determine whether changes in hepatic stiffness and time to hepatic decompensation or death differ based on
genetic ancestry and HIV status in a diverse cohort of patients with cirrhosis; 2) determine whether simvastatin
decreases the risk of hepatic decompensation or death in patients with compensated cirrhosis and clinically
significant portal hypertension (CSPH); and 3) assess whether there are interactions between a) genetic
ancestry or b) HIV status and response to simvastatin."

 The HIV, HCV, and opioid epidemics disparately impact populations in different regions of the US, with
higher burden (51% of new HIV diagnoses in the US) and poorer outcomes (highest HIV mortality in the US, at
6-10 per 1,000 persons with HIV) in the South, particularly largely rural states. Southern states also rank
among those with the highest rates of acute and chronic Hepatitis C virus (HCV), with massive increases in
HCV infections due to injected opioid use in Tennessee, Kentucky, Virginia, and West Virginia between 2006
and 2012 (from 1 to nearly 4 per 100,000). The region has also seen a dramatic increase in overdose mortality
during the COVID-19 pandemic (West Virginia and Tennessee ranked 1st and 3rd in the US, respectively, with
≥50 deaths per 100,000), with opioid abuse a continued driver of the regional HIV/HCV syndemic.
 With the relatively recent HIV/HCV outbreak in Scott County, Indiana in mind, the CDC assessed
county-level vulnerabilities to an HIV outbreak based on acute HCV infection. Acute HCV infection was used
as a proxy of high HIV risk due to the proximal cause of shared injection drug use, an increasingly common
practice in areas afflicted with high rates of opioid use and overdose. The research directly informed the
initiation of the Tennessee Prescription Drug Overdose Program, a CDC-funded surveillance system to monitor
both fatal and non-fatal drug overdoses. Reporting requirements have also been revamped and a new
informatics infrastructure has been created to accommodate automated laboratory uploads of viral hepatide
antibody, antigen, and nucleic acid testing to ascertain acute HCV infection, alongside the state’s already
robust HIV surveillance program. Similar programs now exist in 32 states. In addition, over the past several
years, syringe service programs and expanded access to non-prescription naloxone were made legal under
Public Chapters 413 and 596 in Tennessee, while the state’s “fetal assault” law, along with similar ones in
Alabama and South Carolina, penalized expectant mothers with opioid addictions until recently.
 The proposed research will therefore harmonize, link, and analyze readily available “big data” sources
to enhance the epidemiology of HIV, HIV/HCV co-infection, and opioid overdose mortality outcomes which will
inform HIV/HCV and overdose prevention and treatment activities by improving the targeting of highest-
risk/highest-reward populations for their receipt (Aims 1 and 2). Assessing the impact of individual behavior
and environmental context (neighborhood characteristics such as structural poverty and disorder, lack of
transportation, etc.) as well as policy changes on these outcomes will be an essential addition to the literature,
and as importantly, to data dissemination platforms (e.g., dashboards) which will improve deployment of
prevention and treatment activities in southern states (Aims 1, 2, and 3). Using epidemiologic research to
inform policy, while creating dissemination platforms which may be updated and re-deployed in future for
regional pandemic preparedness, means this work will remain a valuable resource for years to come."
10813199,"The proposed Phase I SBIR will conduct IND-enabling studies to establish the pharmacokinetics
(PK) and SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2) antiviral efficacy of sangivamycin (Sang) in Golden Syrian
hamsters. Sang is an adenosine nucleoside analog that we discovered to be a potent, dose-
dependent inhibitor of CoV-2 during in vitro viral infectivity studies conducted at the NIAID-
Integrated Research Facility (IRF) at Fort Detrick. Sang had significantly superior efficacy against
multiple variants of CoV-2 compared with Remdesivir but Sang also was additive with Remdesivir
when used in combination. CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19, which was first
documented in China in December 2019 and has since rapidly spread across the globe, leading
the World Health Organization to declare a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. CoV-2 has
infected greater than 600 million individuals worldwide with at least 6.4 million attributable deaths
to date. OyaGen has held type B preIND meetings with the FDA (PIND 150794). Historically,
Sang was safely tested in 88 human subjects during NCI cancer clinical trials but was abandoned
due to its lack of efficacy against cancers in human subjects. In this Phase I SBIR OyaGen seeks
to complete preclinical development of Sang as a therapeutic candidate for COVID-19 to facilitate
an IND application to conduct appropriate clinical trials leading to regulatory approval and
commercialization. In response to FDA guidance and comments to our preIND filing (150794) the
goal of this proposal is to conduct PK of Sang in a hamster animal model (Aim 1) as well as to
determine in vivo antiviral efficacy of Sang in the hamster COVID-19 model (Aim 2). The
development of Sang as a therapeutic for infected patients is a medical countermeasure for
immunocompromised people who may not benefit from immunization as well as a stop gap
therapeutic for new strains of CoV for which current vaccines may be less effective. Importantly,
our data support that Sang has the potential to enhance the efficacy of other therapeutics as a
combination therapy option in the future."

Despite increasing access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) in pregnancy, the >1 million children born annually to
pregnant people with HIV (PPHIV) who are HIV-exposed but uninfected (HEU) remain at >2-fold higher risk of
growth stunting and infectious morbidity than HIV-unexposed children. Though the origins of adverse HEU child
health outcomes are poorly understood, mounting evidence suggests that abnormal microbiome development
may play a key role. However, the mechanisms remain elusive, and a better mechanistic understanding is
essential to improve care. Our overarching goals are to identify clinical, environmental, diet, and epidemiologic
features associated with growth stunting in HEU children, characterize mechanisms of host-microbe
communication, and link gut microbiome profiles to immune development in growth stunted HEU children using
a multi’omics approach. To do so, we will leverage data, biobanked, and newly collected samples from an
ongoing prospective longitudinal birth cohort in Uganda to relate growth stunting, diarrheal disease burden, and
adverse clinical outcomes to microbiome-driven changes in HEU child immunity. Innovation: Our disease model
examining and characterizing relationships between transferred maternal immunity, child gut microbiome and
immune profile development, and childhood growth stunting is novel, highly relevant, and conceptually innovative.
Distinct advantages of our proposed research include 1) simultaneous comparison of samples from HIV-exposed
and -unexposed groups to minimize confounding, 2) rich clinical, epidemiologic, and environmental exposure
data in a well-characterized longitudinal cohort, 3) integrated multi’omics approach leveraging metagenomics,
metabolomics, and immun’omics, to identify novel mechanisms of growth stunting and immune development.
Investigators: Our interdisciplinary team with expertise in epidemiology, birth cohorts and infectious diseases
(Bebell); immunology (Alter, Bernshtein), multi’omics (Mehta, Chan, Huttenhower) is well-poised to complete this
work. Approach: We will leverage biobanked samples and extend follow-up of enrolled mother-child dyads in
Dr. Bebell’s (K23AI138856) birth cohort, Dr. Bernstein’s adaptations of the Systems Serology platform to enteric
organisms, and Dr. Mehta’s established multi’omics laboratory and data pipeline infrastructure to elucidate the
effects of maternal HIV exposure and microbiome composition on child growth and immune development through
age 5 via these Specific Aims: 1) Identify clinical metadata features associated with growth stunting in HEU
children with fine resolution; 2) Characterize gut microbiome features associated with growth stunting in HEU
children and establish mechanisms of host-microbe communication using metabolomics; 3) Define alterations in
transplacental antibody transfer and breast milk antibody composition specific to pathogenic and non-pathogenic
gut organisms in PPHIV and growth-stunted HEU children. Identifying HIV-related microbiome abnormalities and
immune mechanisms of growth faltering has great potential to improve child health outcomes by informing
vaccine strategies, microbiome therapy, and early intervention for children at high risk of poor growth outcomes."

Vestibulodynia (VBD) is a chronic pain condition that occurs when pressure is applied to the vestibule, the area
around the opening of the vagina. The condition is characterized by burning, stinging, and stabbing sensations
upon touch, as well as tenderness, redness, and dryness of the vestibule. Activities known to commonly cause
pain include physical touch, tampon use, intercourse, and exercise (e.g., running); wearing tight clothing is also
found to cause pain. VBD is the most common cause of sexual pain and is estimated to affect 11 to 28% of
reproductive aged women in the United States. As further evidence of its public health significance, VBD and
related vulvar pain conditions cost the US economy over $70 billion annually. There is no single effective
treatment for all women with VBD and existing treatments are focused on managing the symptoms of VBD.
First-line treatment for both groups include the application of a lidocaine ointment, cream or gel to the vulvar
vestibule once or twice daily prior to vulvovaginal manipulation. Topical lidocaine 5% ointment, cream or gel, is
difficult to apply due to the content and lack of a directed delivery. The inability to apply a consistent dose of the
topical treatment to the vulva and short duration of treatment make this an important focus in delivery system
development. Innovative vestibule medication delivery systems are needed to permit efficient, localized therapy
that does not interfere with sexual intercourse or the sexual partner. To overcome the challenges associated
with the application of topical lidocaine, AnelleO's research team developed two unique flexible, mucoadhesive
biodissolvable films to be used as a drug delivery system for VBD. While the vagina has been the site for local
delivery of various therapeutic agents, there have been no drug delivery systems designed for application to the
vestibule. AnelleO has conducted two clinical studies in parallel with pre-clinical work. The team completed a
survey of 21 women with VBD to evaluate barriers to available treatment, personal satisfaction with current
treatment, and preferences for future treatment. Building on these data, the following aims are proposed: 1)
conduct in-depth assessment of patient preferences and attributes about the vulvar film physical characteristics
of texture/thickness/flexibility, size/shape, appearance, application, and feel/comfort, 2) implement and optimize
the final product design based on patient preferences input (Aim 1) and finalize quality control tolerances of the
5% lidocaine film, 3) schedule a pre-IND meeting with the FDA and conduct IND-enabling studies for 5%
lidocaine film, and 4) draft and submit an IND application to the FDA. This work will assist AnelleO in bringing
longer-lasting comfort to women with VBD, addressing a highly unmet need in the area of women's sexual
health."

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) give rise to all terminally differentiated cells in the blood. The ability of HSCs
to reconstitute these blood cell lineages for life underlies the efficacy of bone marrow transplantation therapy for
treatment of various blood disorders, including leukemias, anemia, and autoimmunity. Although this is an
established and effective treatment, two-thirds of patients in need of a transplant lack a matched donor.
Therefore, alternative sources of therapeutic HSCs would be a boon to the field. Human pluripotent stem cells
(hPSCs) represent a potential source for cell-based therapies, including the derivation of patient-specific
transplantable HSCs, which would additionally circumvent immune rejection and alloreactivity, both major issues
in the clinic.
The proposed collaborative research leverages the expertise of two Principal Investigators with complementary
research interests and skills in stem cell biology, zebrafish genetics and development, murine HSC biology,
hematopoietic development, and Wnt biology and biochemistry. Using zebrafish and hPSCs as model systems,
they seek to identify and characterize the molecular cues that direct hematopoietic development during early
embryonic stages, with an emphasis on the role of Wnt signaling. The proposed studies will build on their finding
that a signaling axis regulated by Wnt9a/Frizzled9/EGFR is specifically required for HSC emergence and
expansion across vertebrate phyla. This proposal will leverage lineage tracing methods in zebrafish and in vitro
differentiation protocols of hPSCs combined with single-cell sequencing approaches to determine the molecular
mechanisms of this requirement, and to provide a new level of understanding of how posterior lateral mesoderm
is instructed to generate HSCs.
The long-term goal of these studies is to gain a better understanding of how HSCs develop in the embryo in
order to translate this information to hPSCs. Successful completion of this research will have a profound impact
on HSC derivation and expansion, and thereby will be instrumental in overcoming current obstacles to the
effective treatment of diseases requiring bone marrow transplant therapy."

 This proposal describes a unique SUPRA CAR system in human T cells to address in vivo off-tumor toxici-
ty, using an established liver transgene expression mouse model. We will use our recently developed split,
universal and programmable (SUPRA) CAR system that simultaneously encompasses multiple critical up-
grades, such as the ability to finely tune T cell activation strength, sense and logically respond to multiple
antigens, and independently regulate two T cell subtypes simultaneously. Specifically, we will evaluate two
types of circuits: (1) AND and (2) NIMPLY (A AND NOT B) logic CAR circuits, which have been determined
bioinformatically as the best type for circuits for discriminating tumors from healthy cells. The proposed exper-
iments will test the hypotheses that (1) our modular and tunable logic CAR T systems are uniquely
suited for preventing on-target off-tumor toxicity in vivo, even when healthy tissues expressing a tar-
get antigen are near the tumor, and (2) the tumor specificity and activity of our SUPRA CAR systems is
enhanced by controlled delivery. Importantly, preliminary data support these hypotheses, and well-
characterized materials and rigorous experimental designs are established in this proposal with essential
cross-disciplinary collaborations and expertise that encompass synthetic biology, immunology, animal tumor
biology, and biomaterials. The specific aims of this five-year proposal are as follows: Aim 1 evaluates AND log-
ic SUPRA CAR specificity in vivo. Aim 2 investigate the tumor specificity and toxicity of NIMPLY logic SUPRA
CAR in vivo. Aim 3 determine the effect of adaptor protein delivery mechanism on tumor-targeting specificity.
Outcomes from this work will establish the clinical potential of logic CAR systems and expand their use to addi-
tional cancers, including solid tumors."

Significance: Neural circuit assembly requires activity-dependent refinement of circuit architecture (e.g.
plasticity) to produce stereotyped behavior. Neurons are particularly susceptible to functional and structural
plasticity during early developmental windows called critical periods. It is clear that failure to terminate critical
period plasticity adversely affects mature circuit function in both animal models and humans (e.g. autism and
epilepsy), yet the mechanisms that close critical periods are largely unknown. This Pathway to Independence
Award proposal seeks to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms that promote critical period
closure, and to define how critical periods shape circuit architecture to ensure proper locomotor behavior.

neuroscience in the laboratory of Dr. Kelly Monk at WashU School of Medicine, where she used forward and
reverse genetic strategies to uncover regulators of myelination (NS087801). She then joined the laboratory of
the renowned neurobiologist Dr. Chris Doe (UO, HHMI/NAS). Here, she defined a novel critical period of
plasticity in the developing Drosophila motor circuit, and uncovered a series of astrocyte-derived molecular
regulators of critical period closure (NS098690). In this proposal, Dr. Ackerman will extend her current skills in
molecular genetics, live imaging, and circuit analysis to include training in electrophysiology and single cell
RNAseq (scRNAseq), two completely new techniques for her. Further, she will use two model systems (fly and
zebrafish) to determine how these novel, astrocyte-derived factors restrict motor circuit plasticity (Aim 1), to
define how the critical period contributes to motor circuit connectivity, function, and behavior (Aim 2), and to
determine how motor circuit plasticity is developmentally constrained in vertebrates (Aim 3).
Career development: In addition to continued mentorship by Dr. Doe, the candidate has assembled an
exceptional team of mentors and collaborators from the University of Oregon and beyond. During the mentored
phase, the candidate will train in NMJ electrophysiology from Dr. Dion Dickman (USC) in order to define how
the level of activity experienced by motor neurons during the critical period shapes motor output and behavior.
This training is essential for future studies of motor circuit function in the candidate's own lab. Further, she has
gathered a local team of advisors from the zebrafish community, Dr. Judith Eisen and Dr. Adam Miller, who
have a combined 40 years of experience in zebrafish motor circuits. Drs. Eisen and Miller will facilitate training
in scRNAseq, and will provide critical career development advice from the complementary perspectives of a
seasoned (Dr. Eisen) and recently-established (Dr. Miller) principal investigator. Funding of this proposal will
equip Dr. Ackerman with the unique skillset required to launch a robust and successful research program that
pushes the boundaries of our understanding of circuit plasticity, from molecules to behavior."

 Botswana has been one of the countries most affected by HIV-1 and has always been in the top 3
countries by HIV-1 prevalence for the past 20 years. The country has responded gallantly by providing free
antiretroviral therapy (ART) to persons living with HIV-1 (PLWH) in 2002 and an aggressive combination of
prevention strategies. This has resulted in reduced HIV-1 incidence and associated mortality and the country
was the third globally to reach the UNAIDS 95-95-95 targets of HIV-1 diagnosis, treatment, and viral
suppression. Since its inception in 1996, the Botswana Harvard AIDS Institute Partnership (BHP) has
conducted investigator-initiated clinical trials, observational and epidemiologic studies, laboratory-based
studies, and implementation science research. BHP laboratory also carries out molecular virology research
on HIV and this research has been instrumental in molecular characterizing HIV-1 subtype C, which
predominates in Botswana and Southern Africa. We draw upon the depth and breadth of the experience
gained over more than 2 decades of investigator-initiated research, training, and capacity building to increase
access to HIV-1 genomics training. Since 2017, we have invested in implementing pathogen agnostic next-
generation sequencing which was critical in the first sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant of
concern in Botswana. Working with our collaborators we have also established cohorts of very early treated
infants and adolescents for understanding HIV-1 reservoirs.
 We, therefore, aim through this application to strengthen BHP in HIV-1 genomics and molecular virology
capacity in Botswana and increase access to pathogen genomics in the sub-Saharan Africa region as a
center of excellence. The capacity developed here will be crosscutting for virologic studies and will thus be
instrumental in BHP lab’s continued diversification into research on other emerging pathogens of global public
health interest. To achieve this, we aim to 1) develop and advance BHP as an HIV-1 genomics regional
center of excellence. We will leverage the expertise in pathogen genomics developed over the past 20 years
to facilitate capacity building by hosting courses in HIV-1 sequencing, bioinformatic analysis, and sequence
data interpretation. Building on our collaboration with the University of Botswana, Harvard T.H. Chan School
of Public Health (HSPH), and the Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT & Harvard, we will target students and faculty
from local and regional Institutions for the training. We will facilitate the development of HIV genomics, make
them accessible to local universities and other countries in the region, and 2) To establish HIV-1 Reservoir
assays in support of the ongoing and planned HIV-1 cure studies at BHP. We plan to set up assays for the
assessment of HIV-1 reservoirs in PLWH in Botswana. Laboratory scientists will be trained on a number of
these assays at the collaborator’s laboratory in Boston (Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT & Harvard). We will
also train and establish capacity for the bioinformatic analysis for HIV-1 reservoir characterization.

success of antiretroviral therapy (ART), there is no approved HIV vaccine or cure. Research and development
(R&D) of gene and cell therapies has made progress e.g. innovative strategies to induce host resistance,
immunoreactivity against HIV or making host cells unable to produce viable virions. On-going efforts include
≈40 clinical trials but none include Africa. Given the high genetic diversity of populations in SSA and the fact
that the brunt of the burden is in SSA, it is critical that SSA should be involved in ongoing R&D. In 2020, the
Joint Clinical Research Center (JCRC), Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center (Fred Hutch) and Caring Cross
founded the Global Gene Therapy Initiative (GGTI) to include low-and-middle income countries e.g. Uganda
in ongoing HIV cell and gene therapy R&D. A preliminary assessment at JCRC showed health workforce
capacity gaps in almost all stages of R&D of gene and cell therapies including translational research. This is
also the case at other premier research and tertiary institutions in Uganda. To address this, JCRC has sent
her scientists for training in the US, and hereby propose a D71 planning process titled Leveraging North-
South Partnerships to Advance Gene and cell Therapy Research Training for HIV in Uganda (G&CT-Uganda)
in collaboration with Makerere University (Mak) and Fred Hutch. The goal is to prepare a D43 application for
an HIV research training program in Gene and cell Therapy at JCRC and Mak. Specific Aim 1 (develop a
robust strategic plan for efficiently leveraging JCRC’s North-South partnerships to plan for a research training
program in Gene and cell Therapy for HIV) will be achieved through face-to-face/virtual meetings,
consultations and a workshop with leaders from collaborating institutions. Specific Aim 2 (assess the critical
faculty development needs in Gene and cell Therapy for HIV research at Ugandan institutions), and Specific
Aim 3 (assess the training needs of potential trainees that are interested Gene and cell Therapy for HIV
research in Uganda) will be achieved through a training needs assessment i.e. desk review of current training
curricular, programs, faculty and resources at collaborating institutions; ii) key informant interviews and on-
line surveys among trainers, admissions officers and leaders at collaborating institutions; and iii) focus group
discussion among prospective trainees i.e. undergraduate and graduate students and Mak and Mbarara
University of Science and Technology. Specific Aim 4 (describe the envisioned research training program in
Gene and cell Therapy for HIV and identify/develop new training modules and courses to include), and
Specific Aim 5 (describe trainee recruitment approaches) will be achieved through meetings, consultations
and workshops with trainers, curriculum developers and leaders at collaborating institutions. Specific Aim 6
(develop and submit a D43 application to the National Institutes of Health) will be achieved through weekly

10932872,"Project Summary/Abstract
Impaired social motivation, or “asociality,” is a negative symptom of schizophrenia and a cause of significant
functional impairment in the illness. Whereas many symptoms of schizophrenia can be treated with
antipsychotic medications, deficits in social motivation persist, leading to significant social disability in patients.
There is currently no effective treatment for this symptom of the illness. One promising and unexplored avenue
to enhance social motivation in schizophrenia is ± 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). MDMA is a
psychostimulant that shares some pharmacological properties with amphetamines, but in addition, has
pronounced pro-social effects, increasing the motivation to engage socially. In healthy volunteers, it produces
feelings of empathy and closeness with others and increases attention to positive social cues, perhaps partly
through its effects on the social bonding hormone, oxytocin. MDMA has shown promise in other psychiatric
conditions such as PTSD. Thus, MDMA could offer a unique therapeutic benefit in patients with schizophrenia
who suffer from impaired social motivation. We plan to test the hypothesis that MDMA enhances social
motivation in patients with schizophrenia by conducting a two-phase study. The first phase (Aim 1) will be an
open-label, ascending-dose, within-subject trial in which participants will receive 40mg, 80mg, or 120mg of
MDMA. The doses will be administered in ascending order, but doses will be stopped if subjects experience
moderate or greater psychotic symptoms at 24 hours. This trial will assess the tolerability of the drug in this
population and guide in the selection of a maximum well-tolerated dose for the second phase. The primary
tolerability measure will be clinician-rated psychotic symptoms (disorganized speech, delusions, hallucinations)
collected at 24 hours after MDMA administration. Phase 2 (Aim 2) will be a randomized, placebo-controlled
trial using a crossover design to test the acute effects of MDMA on social motivation and plasma oxytocin in
patients with schizophrenia. Social motivation will be assessed using a social attention bias task (ABT), which
has been validated in MDMA trials with healthy volunteers, in addition to secondary behavioral and self-report
measures of social motivation. The results of this project will lay the foundation for further investigations of
MDMA and other psychoactive compounds as a treatment for debilitating and difficult-to-treat social deficits in
schizophrenia. Future studies will examine interactions between the effects of psychoactive compounds and
nonpharmacologic psychosocial interventions targeting social symptoms."

Since 1998, the NIH-funded Centers for AIDS Research (CFAR) have hosted an annual one day National
CFAR Scientific Symposium in conjunction with the annual CFAR Directors’/Administrators’ meeting. The
purpose of the CFAR scientific symposium is to present, in a public forum, recent “cutting edge” advances in
HIV research for an average attendance of approximately 250-300. Whenever possible, topics will reflect
issues related to the OAR HIV/AIDS Priorities. The intimate size of the meeting promotes opportunities for
interactions between young and more senior investigators that would not be available at the larger annual
scientific meetings related to HIV/AIDS. A key innovation in the last ten years is the addition of a peer
mentoring workshop for attending early-stage investigators. The meeting location rotates so that it is hosted
each year by a different CFAR site. This provides geographic diversity for the venue and opportunities for a
broader array of participants than for similar research symposia. As in the past, each hosting CFAR site has
the flexibility to design the scientific agenda of the conference to meet the current interests and needs of the
CFAR scientific community. Each hosting CFAR will ensure that there is representation of individuals from
diverse backgrounds across the selection and the makeup of the organizing committee, speakers, invited
participants, and, in particular, the selected early-stage investigators receiving travel scholarships from this
grant.
Speakers are selected from the various NIH-funded Centers for AIDS Research leadership, their scientific
membership, and from nationally and internationally recognized research institutions. In addition to the
participating CFAR Directors and invited leaders in the field, the remaining participants for the annual National
CFAR Symposia are chosen based on specific criteria. First preference is given to young investigators who
have received developmental funds from an NIH-funded CFAR program; second preference to young
investigators with demonstrable potential in HIV/AIDS research; third preference is to other senior investigators
engaged in HIV/AIDS research. In all cases women and individuals from underrepresented ethnic groups are
encouraged to attend through targeted advertising and travel scholarships. Access to childcare is provided by
the hosting CFAR and webcasts of the symposia are available for interested investigators who are not able to
attend."

 Nucleases are a class of enzyme that hydrolyze nucleic acid substrate in a variety of cellular processes.
Their activity is a requirement for the maintenance of genomic integrity in DNA replication, repair, and
recombination. Understanding nuclease regulation and specificity in these processes is critical for modeling
these fundamental pathways and human diseases linked to dysregulation. This includes Lynch syndrome, a
cancer predisposition syndrome linked to colorectal and endometrial cancers, Huntington’s disease, and
infertility. Nucleases unique to bacteria are also potential targets for antibiotics and a complete understanding of
nuclease biochemistry paves the way for the discovery of new drug targets and exploiting nucleases as new
biotechnological tools and therapeutic agents. Characterizing and developing novel nucleases is a future area
of interest for my research program.
 We will use proteins in DNA repair processes to model nuclease activity and determine regulation and
specificity steps. Using the tractable DNA mismatch repair pathway which spellchecks newly replicated DNA, we
will identify how inherently nonspecific nucleases can be given specificity. Proteins in this process have been
co-opted for meiotic recombination and also play a role in the regulation of trinucleotide repeat expansions
indicating that the associated nuclease activity is modular. This work addresses the origins of this co-option and
provides missing mechanistic detail for how all of these pathways communicate substrate specificity to
nucleolytic sites. In bacteria, homologous recombination is a method for acquiring antibiotic resistance. MutS2,
a homolog to mismatch recognition complexes, has been implicated in several bacteria as being involved in this
pathway. Its mechanisms of action and whether it follows paradigms established by canonical mismatch repair
proteins are not clear and are addressed by mechanistic work described here. The nuclease domain of MutS2
is found throughout biology as a fusion to proteins with diverse specificities and functions. We will determine the
modularity of this nuclease domain, how it achieves specificity by other domains, and test its potential for
adaptation as a gene editing tool. We will also investigate the specificity and regulatory mechanisms of the newly
discovered NucS protein which is multi-functional, and is implicated in multiple DNA repair processes in archaea
and mycobacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacteria that causes tuberculosis. This will provide
key evidence for adaptation processes of organisms that utilize NucS in DNA repair processes.
 Our work will provide an underpinning for complex mechanistic models that can be ultimately used to detect
and develop therapeutics for human disease. In addition, this work provides general insight into how nucleases
are regulated and will guide future studies in other cellular pathways."

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways. Asthma prevalence has increased markedly in the
United States, with 19 million adults reporting current asthma and 62% of them with uncontrolled asthma. Poor
diet quality is an important risk factor implicated in this alarming trend as a typical western diet features
processed, energy-dense, nutrient-deficient foods, promoting a proinflammatory host environment. Diet quality in
asthma is an emerging area of research; few interventional trials have investigated healthy dietary patterns in
adults with asthma, none was adequately powered to determine efficacy, and underlying mechanisms are poorly
understood. OBJECTIVE: To fill this gap, the current 2-phase, milestone-driven ALOHA trial will rigorously
evaluate the efficacy and mechanisms of a behavioral intervention promoting the Dietary Approaches to Stop
Hypertension (DASH). This behavioral intervention showed promising results in a pilot trial among adults with
uncontrolled asthma. METHODS: The R61 phase (1 year) will focus on finalizing trial planning and preparation
and begin early enrollment; in the R33 phase (4 years) we will conduct a 2-arm randomized clinical trial over 12
months. Adults with uncontrolled asthma (n=320) on standard controller therapy will be equally randomized and
assessed at baseline (0), 3, 6 and 12 months. The control and intervention groups will be matched on the
number, frequency, and format of sessions over 12 months while the length of each session is proportional to the
content delivered. Control participants will receive education on lung health, asthma, and other general health
topics using American Lung Association and UpToDate materials. The intervention group will receive the same
health education and materials in addition to DASH behavioral counseling. Central hypothesis: Compared with
the education-only control, the DASH behavioral intervention will lead to significantly more participants with a
clinically significant improvement (responders) in asthma-specific quality of life (primary outcome) and
significantly greater improvements in related asthma and non-asthma outcomes, which will be mechanistically
linked to improved diet quality. SPECIFIC AIMS: First, to determine intervention efficacy on the primary outcome
of clinically significant improvement in asthma-specific quality of life at 12 months and secondary outcomes
(asthma control, lung function, generic qualify of life, blood pressure, mental health, sleep health). Second, to
examine the intervention effects on metabolomic (circulating short-chain fatty acids: propionate, butyrate,
acetate), immune response (interferon-gamma, IL-5, IL-17A, IL-10, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNFα), and physiologic
(bronchodilator responsiveness) biomarkers of asthma. Third, to examine the intervention effects on self-
reported and objective indices of diet quality (DASH score, dietary inflammatory index, serum carotenoids). We
also will conduct exploratory analyses of causal mediation linking diet quality, biomarkers, and asthma outcomes
as well as effect modification by sex and other biological variables (age of asthma onset, atopy). IMPACT: This
trial has high potential to advance the clinical and mechanistic understandings of diet quality in asthma."

The prevalence of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) is on the rise and represents a health
concern for women of childbearing age. Over an 8 year period, a major increase in the prevalence of births
complicated by pre-gestational diabetes increased by 50% .Pre-gestational diabetes is one of the most common
maternal risk factors for maternal, fetal, and infant complications. Preliminary evidence by our group evaluated
inflammatory biomarkers in pregnant subjects longitudinally during gestation. Several inflammatory cytokines
including C-reactive protein (CRP) were significantly elevated in T2D relative to non-diabetic controls, and this
effect was more evident in the third trimester. Thus, maternal inflammation later in pregnancy may represent an
important mechanistic link associated with health risks for mother an infant in diabetic pregnancy. Infants and
children from diabetic mothers are more likely to suffer neurological impairments compared to offspring of non-
diabetic mothers. Thus, we hypothesized that the increase in third trimester inflammation found in diabetic
pregnancy could adversely impact fetal brain development, a significant period of brain growth in humans. A
majority of the studies to date have linked poor infant outcome with various maternal risk factors. However, these
studies were limited in that the assessments did not occur in real time. The world’s first biomagnetic sensing
system at UAMS was built specifically to track and understand the process of fetal brain development. The SARA
(SQUID Array for Reproductive Assessment) system consists of 151 primary superconducting sensors which
detect biomagnetic fields generated in the body including fetal heart, and fetal brain. SARA is based on the non-
invasive magnetoencephalography (MEG) technique that permits the investigation of fetal parameters from early
gestation until delivery. We developed an optimized combination of recording parameters using auditory and
visual stimuli and spontaneous brain activity for a multimodal approach to understand fetal neurological
development trajectory. The overall goal is to correlate fetal and infant brain development with inflammatory
markers in mothers with pre-gestational T1D and T2D. We will obtain maternal blood samples for cytokine
assessment at their regularly scheduled third trimester SARA visit. We will also collect maternal and cord blood
samples at delivery. Aim 1: Implement an integrated multimodal approach to investigate fetal and neonatal brain
activity along with assessment of blood inflammatory biomarkers in pre-gestational diabetic mothers. Aim 2:
Track and quantify brain activity using MEG signals during fetal and neonatal stage of life. Aim 3: Correlate the
inflammatory biomarkers to fetal and neonatal brain activity."

Tick-borne rickettsial diseases (TBRDs) are ubiquitously present throughout the world and case fatality rates in
disease clusters can range up to 100% despite the availability of effective treatment. Thus, there is a need to
increase the “tool box” for TBRD control by supplementing existing strategies with promising novel approaches
that focus on interrupting the Rickettsia transmission cycle in the tick vector. Our recent studies demonstrated
that the non-pathogenic Candidatus Rickettsia andeanae is secreted in tick saliva during feeding, but at a lower
level when compared to pathogenic Rickettsia parkeri, raising questions regarding the underlying mechanisms
that mediate rickettsial pathogenicity. The likelihood that rickettsiae manipulate the arthropod host to enhance
horizontal transmission has been recognized, yet the specific interactions between Rickettsia and ticks remains
unknown. Unfortunately, significant knowledge gaps exist regarding the basic transmission biology of tick-borne
Rickettsia and the specific interactions between Rickettsia and tick physiology that enable transmission, which
represents a significant barrier to the field and has limited the development of novel approaches to control
TBRDs. Thus, the premise of this proposal is that pathogenic Rickettsia, but not non-pathogenic strains of
Rickettsia, alter regulation of tick-derived proteins to enhance salivary gland physiology and increase the
secretory activity of the gland, which facilitates increased horizontal transmission. Salivary gland function is
dependent on strict regulation of acini membrane physiology and thus, we hypothesize that Rickettsia alter
mechanisms for ionic homeostasis to facilitate horizontal transmission. Correspondingly, we hypothesize that
inhibition of ion flux will negate the rickettsial-mediated enhancement of salivary gland activity to prevent tick
bloodmeal feeding and horizontal transmission of Rickettsia. In Specific Aim 1, we will employ a
multidisciplinary approach to measure the influence pathogenic Rickettsia has to secretory activity and
membrane physiology (e.g. membrane potential) of an R. parkeri infected tick salivary gland compared to non-
pathogenic Rickettsia infected ticks. These data will delineate the mechanism by which Rickettsia influences
tick salivary gland physiology to drive pathogenicity. In Specific Aim 2, we will test if dysregulation of K+
homeostasis across salivary gland epithelia will inhibit salivary gland function of rickettsemic ticks to alter blood
feeding biology and reduce R. parkeri virulence in vertebrate disease models. Combined, the experiments
outlined in his proposal will define unique aspects of rickettsial influence on tick physiology that enhance
pathogenicity of Rickettsia, which will assist in resolving the epidemiology of SFG Rickettsia and reveal
intervention points to reduce the health burden of TBRDs."
10923811,"Proposal Summary 
Breathing is a vital function constantly regulated by the interoceptive signals from the body, and breathing patterns are known to impact emotional and cognitive processes. Breathing patterns with essential pulmonary interoception functions, such as sighing and coughing, are relevant to many pathological conditions, including sleep apnea, sudden infant death syndrome, excessive coughing, COVID-19, and various nervous system disorders, such as panic disorder, phobias, post-traumatic stress disorder, drug abuse, and even brain death. Therefore, there is a critical need to identify the neural mechanisms underlying the interoceptive control of breathing and how they fail under pathological conditions, to develop more effective treatments to breathing abnormalities. Sighing is an augmented breath with a deep, double-size inspiration that is dramatically induced in hypoxia. In contrast, coughing is a protective breathing pattern with a characteristic enlarged expiration phase triggered by tussive agents exposed in the airways. However, the neural circuits underlying these essential and discrete breathing patterns and how the brain interprets and integrates these different interoceptive sensory stimuli are largely unknown. In our preliminary studies, we identified two neuronal populations with distinct gene expression, connectivity, neural activity, and function, in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), the first relay center in the brain that receives interoceptive afferent signals from the visceral organs. These neurons respectively mediate hypoxia induced sighing and tussive challenge induced coughing, two discrete breathing patterns associated with different interoceptive signals. Based on these findings, we propose to test our hypothesis that these two distinct NTS neurons are the key nodes in two segregated interoceptive neural circuits for controlling discrete breathing patterns and for representing these internal states, by receiving distinct afferent inputs and differently activating downstream brain circuits. We will integrate state-of-the-art techniques, including genetic targeting, viral-based neural circuit tracing, activity dependent neuron targeting, optogenetics and chemogenetics, genetic ablation, respiratory physiology, single molecule fluorescent RNA in situ hybridization, and in vivo calcium recording, to identify the neural circuits and pathways underlying these two interoceptive processes in vivo in freely moving mice. By focusing on these two distinct NTS neuron populations and neural circuits, we will delineate the distinct interoceptive afferent pathways from the periphery to the brain, identify the brain regions that mediate sighing and coughing, and define the higher brain regions for interpreting and integrating these distinct interoceptive signals. This work will provide novel molecular and cellular specificity for the interoceptive neural circuits for sighing and coughing respectively, and reveal the organizing principles of the NTS and the brain to ascertain differential interoceptive signals and inputs through the vagal afferent pathways. Furthermore, the proposed studies will also build the foundation for future clinical studies on the role of interoception in neuropathological conditions."

Cancer and treatment-related cognitive changes cause distress, hinder resumption of normal routine and roles,
and worsen quality of life. Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is a potentially life-prolonging treatment for
patients with hematological malignancies. HCT differs from the delivery of chemotherapy in other cancer settings
due to the intensity of chemotherapy and severity of toxicity. Previously reserved for younger patients, in the past
decade a growing number of adults 60 years of age and older have received this intense treatment. Our
preliminary data shows that post-HCT, 35% of older patients experience significant cognitive impairment
compared to 19% pre-HCT. Physical activity improves cognitive function in older adults and survivors of other
cancers. While untested in older adults undergoing HCT, we hypothesize that increasing physical activity can
also improve cognitive function in this vulnerable population. The objective of this proposal is to adapt and test
an evidence-based physical activity intervention, The Community Health Activities Model Program for Seniors II
(CHAMPS II), in the HCT setting to improve cognitive function for adults 60 years and older. This program is
effective in increasing physical activity for sedentary community-dwelling older adults with multiple chronic health
conditions. We will iteratively adapt and implement CHAMPS-II in three waves. During each wave, 2-4
patient/care-partner dyads will participate in a multi-phase, light- to moderate-intensity physical activity program.
We will use a Type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation design to determine the preliminary effectiveness of
the adapted intervention to improve cognitive function compared to an active control condition (N = 34 per group).
This novel trial design spans the effectiveness and implementation research to accelerate the translation of
physical activity interventions into practice for older adults with cancer. The translation of physical activity
interventions into clinical practice remains challenging within cancer survivorship, despite promising evidence of
efficacy in improving functional outcomes and quality of life. To become an independent researcher who
develops, implements, and disseminates interventions that prevent cognitive decline and improve functional
outcomes for older patients with cancer, Dr. Koll requires additional training and experience in: 1) physical activity
promotion and principles of exercise training; 2) design and conduct of hybrid effectiveness-implementation
clinical trials; and 3) leadership and project management skills needed to execute translational studies requiring
collaboration between researchers and clinicians. An outstanding team of mentors and advisors support this
proposal with expertise in geriatrics (Fisher), behavioral and implementation science (Estabrooks), clinical
exercise trials in older adult and cancer populations (Ehlers), geriatric oncology (Wildes), cognitive disorders and
cognitive aging (Murman), and mixed methods (Jones). The training and research plan will position Dr. Koll to
become one of the few geriatricians with expertise in cognition and cognition-enhancing interventions in older
adults with cancer."

 Breast tumor cells metastasize to distant organs through non-adherent microenvironments, such as the
bloodstream or lymphatics. However, very little is known about the dynamic behavior and drug responses of
non-adherent tumor cells, due to the challenges of imaging non-adherent cells without blurring from cell drift.
 The PI’s lab discovered unique microtentacles (McTNs) on the surface of non-adherent tumor cells that
promote the aggregation and retention of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the lung capillaries of living mice.
 This project will test the hypothesis that actin cortical contraction regulates molecular mechanisms underlying
McTNs and can be targeted through independent pathways to reduce the clustering and reattachment of CTCs
during metastasis. Predictions of this hypothesis will be tested in the following specific aims.
Specific Aim 1: Inhibit kinases regulating actin cortical contraction to impact McTNs.
A) Define impact of pathway inhibitors on microtentacles and supporting molecular mechanisms.
B) Analyze inhibitor impacts on tumor cell mechanical properties (Brillouin microscopy, AFM).
C) Test prioritized drugs in zebrafish (CTC reattachment), mice (orthotopic, PDX) and live patient tumor cells.
Specific Aim 2: Test role of X-ROS mechanotransduction on McTN mechanisms and function.
A) Chemically inhibit TRPM8 and calcium signaling to influence McTN mechanisms.
B) Gauge effects of pathway inhibitors on MCAM and genetically regulating MCAM or TRPM8 (CRISPR).
C) Test prioritized mechanotransduction genes and drugs in zebrafish, mice and patient tumor cells.
Specific Aim 3: Target mechanisms of McTN-mediated tumor clustering.
A) Define McTN mechanisms that inhibit homotypic/heterotypic clustering with Digitoxin or Ouabain.
B) Downregulate desmosomal protein DSG3 to reduce McTN-mediated tumor cell clustering.
C) Test prioritized anti-clustering mechanisms in zebrafish, mice and live patient tumor cells.
This project will use innovative bioengineering techniques (TetherChip, Brillouin microscopy) and examine
highly-conserved mechanotransduction principles (X-ROS), recently identified by the PI’s lab in epithelial tumor
cells. Inclusion of FDA-approved therapies and drugs in current clinical trials will increase the potential to rapidly
translate the outcomes of this project to impact the clinical treatment of metastatic breast cancer."

 Loss of the breast cancer susceptibility (BRCA1 or BRCA2) genes in hereditary breast and ovarian
cancer (HBOC) is characterized by defects DNA repair by homologous recombination (HR) and in the
protection of replication forks (known as fork protection (FP)). It is thought that HR and FP deficiencies produce
points of vulnerability in cancer cells because they cannot fix or prevent DNA double stranded breaks (DSBs)
and therefore cells are sensitive to DNA damaging agents such as to cisplatin and Poly (ADP-ribose)
polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (PARPi). Our recent findings provide a counter model in which these therapies
induce single stranded DNA (ssDNA) gaps that sensitize BRCA deficient cells due to a defect in gap
suppression (GS). Several BRCA mutant cell models support gaps in mediating response, however, each
model of resistance maintains at least two functions. Thus, it is not certain which function underlies the
resistance, leaving a knowledge gap that limits clinical insight. The development of effective therapies requires
identifying whether HR, FP, and/or GS is the fundamental mediator of response. This goal of this study is to
systematically disrupt and retain each function (HR, FP, GS) within BRCA2 to define what function is critical for
therapy resistance, elucidate a unified mechanism of resistance, and provide insight into inhibiting pathways of
resistance to inform therapeutic choices. To do this we aim to determine the molecular mechanism of GS
through mapping the GS domain(s) in BRCA2 (Specific Aim 1). In BRCA2 deficient cells complemented with
wild-type vs a series of BRCA mutants that either delete or selectively target well-characterized domains (i.e.,
HR or FP), protein interacting regions, or DNA binding sites, we will analyze gap induction in our routine DNA
fiber and immunofluorescence assays. If not already well characterized, we will assess mutants for HR
proficiency in standard assays and FP via examination of nascent strand degradation in DNA fiber assays. We
will use CRISPR/CAS9 to make additional mutants in the identified GS domain(s) to further characterize the
critical residues mediating GS. We will also test PARPi sensitivity of these mutant expressing cells in order to
assess the link of HR, FP, or GS to response. We also aim to determine if apoptosis underlies loss of cell
viability in BRCA2 deficient cells following genotoxins (Specific Aim 2). Apoptosis will be measured using
standard assays in BRCA2 mutants following treatment with cisplatin or PARPi. In addition, we will treat cells
with apoptosis inhibitors and determine if sensitivity to PARPi or cisplatin is suppressed. We will verify the time
and dose in which DSBs are induced compared to apoptosis and assess if inhibition of apoptosis reduces DSB
formation. The rationale for the proposed research is that BRCA2 deficiency will be most effectively treated by
therapies that form gaps, gap formation will be a biomarker of tumor response, and to maximize therapy
response, pathways limiting gap formation should be targeted. The insight gained from the experiments
proposed will have implications for cancer and provide new opportunities for therapeutic intervention."

Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is responsible for nearly half of all deaths from liver disease. Despite
the severity of this disease, there remain no FDA-approved treatments for any stage of the disease,
highlighting the critical need to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of ALD progression to develop new
therapies. Mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 1 (MKP-1) is the archetypal member of the dual-
specificity phosphatases with a pivotal role in organ inflammation and injury, including in the liver. Earlier work
showed that decreased MKP-1 levels are associated with the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK),
which triggers an apoptotic cascade leading to alcohol induced liver injury. However, the exact mechanisms of
how MKP-1 downregulation leads to hepatocyte injury and/or inflammation in ALD are known. Moreover, the
role of MKP-1 in macrophages and MAPK-driven inflammation in ALD has never been examined. Our
preliminary studies show that MKP-1 deletion in hepatocytes augments alcohol-induced liver injury is a NIAAA
chronic plus binge model of ALD. Data also suggest that MKP-1 deletion in hepatocytes sensitizes them to
TNFα induced toxicity. As an aspiring scientist whose goal is to pursue a career in alcohol-related multi-organ
pathology, investigating new players in ALD pathogenesis would not only help fill this medical need but also
serve as an excellent platform from which to learn how to become a successful scientist. With the help and
supervision of my mentors Dr. Gobejishvili (an expert in basic research on ALD) and Dr. McClain (an expert on
clinical aspects of the disease) as well as several knowledgeable collaborators, I will investigate the role of
alcohol-associated downregulation of MKP-1 in the pathogenesis of ALD. The first aim of this study is to further
characterize the role of MKP-1 deletion in hepatocytes using hepatocyte specific MKP-1 knpockout mice in two
different mouse models of ALD. I will isolate hepatocytes and immune cells from these models, examine the
effect of MKP-1 deletion on pro-inflammatory chemokine production and immune cell phenotype and describe
changes in hepatocyte and immune cell health and function. The second aim will determine the role of MKP-1
specifically in macrophages using RAW 264.7 macrophage cell line, primary Kupffer cells and macrophage-
specific knockout mice. To complete this research, I will follow a detailed training plan laid out for me by my co-
mentors and pursue my career goals. These include, among others, continuing my didactic training in areas
relevant to my research, gaining experience in new laboratory techniques, developing effective written and oral
communication skills, and building a professional network of scientists. Collectively, the training and research
proposed here will not only fill a significant need for the development of ALD treatments but will also foster my
development from a young scientist to a successful, independent investigator in the field of alcohol-induced
organ disease."
10913308,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The DNA damage sensor kinase ATR is essential for human cell viability and plays a crucial role in cell tolerance
to DNA replication stress1–3. Cancer cells often feature elevated levels of replication stress due to oncogene
action and are therefore susceptible to inhibitors of ATR, making ATR a prime target in anti-cancer therapies4–7.
While ATR inhibitors have been shown to be particularly effective in combination with replication stress-inducing
agents, the molecular mechanisms behind these drug synergies remain poorly understood, primarily due to the
sheer complexity of the ATR signaling network5,8–11. To uncover the signaling events that underlie these
therapeutic synergies, I will utilize mass spectrometry to perform both unbiased and targeted phosphoproteomic
screens in cancer cells lines treated with different chemotherapeutic agents shown to synergize with ATR
inhibitors. Pilot unbiased screens I conducted in HCT116 cancer cells have begun to identify and quantify ATR
signaling in response to chemotherapies CPT and Olaparib, allowing each response to be barcoded for direct
comparison. Comparing pilot barcodes revealed dramatic differences in ATR signaling induced by each drug,
also raising questions regarding whether such ATR signaling varies further between cancers resistant to these
chemotherapies8,12. Moreover, when investigating CPT-induced ATR signaling, we uncovered a set of non-
canonical signaling events that are independent of DNA resection, a process required for the activation of
canonical ATR signaling1,13. These non-canonical signaling substrates include proteins involved in the dissolution
of R-loops: DNA:RNA hybrids that increase in abundance upon CPT treatment and contribute to genome
instability14–16. Faced with these data, I hypothesize that ATR signaling varies between drug treatments
and cancer cell types, and that non-canonical ATR signaling contributes to CPT resistance via regulation
of DNA:RNA hybrid processing. I aim to expand signaling barcodes for CPT and Olaparib-induced ATR
responses several fold via scaled up phosphoproteomic screens, curating a synthetic peptide library from events
uncovered. This library will enable high-throughput targeted barcoding of ATR signaling responses across
cancers differentially resistant to CPT, Olaparib, and ATR inhibitor combination therapy, allowing for correlation
of chemotherapy resistance with cancer-specific ATR signaling. I also aim to investigate the role of novel
resection-independent ATR signaling events in cancer resistance to CPT by using genetic, biochemical, and cell
biological techniques. Overall, results will delineate drug- and cancer-specific ATR responses and establish the
contribution of a new mode of ATR signaling to chemotherapy outcomes. Generated knowledge will serve as a
framework for systems-wide dissection of the mechanisms underlying ATR inhibitor chemotherapeutic synergies
and resistances, potentially revealing drug targets and opportunities for more selective combination therapies."
10831082,"Systemic inflammation and oxidative stress are common in patients with AF. In atrial cardiomyocytes (CMs),
AF can be precipitated by NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1β secretion. Since we have established
cardiac NLRP3 activation and IL-1β can lead to AF, we will study upstream modulators of the cardiac NLRP3
inflammasome that can be manipulated to reduce AF risk in DM.
 We have found that enzymes producing pro-inflammatory molecules are elevated and inflammation resolving
molecules are reduced in atria from humans and mice with DM. Specifically, we have found increased 12-
lipoxygenase (12-LOX, encoded by ALOX12), an enzyme that processes arachidonic acid (AA) to pro-
inflammatory metabolites in humans and mice. In humans and mice, we have found that cardiac pro-resolving
lipid mediators (SPMs) are reduced, leucine-rich repeat containing G protein-coupled receptor 6 (LGR6, encoded
by LGR6), a recently described receptor of SPMs, is downregulated, and 15-hydroxyprostaglandin
dehydrogenase (15-PGDH; encoded by HPGD), an enzyme in the inactivation of SPMs, is increased in DM atria.
Hypotheses to be tested: Since SPMs can reduce NLRP3 activation, this application explores whether DM-
associated AF risk can be mitigated by enhancing SPM signaling by reducing inflammatory lipid mediator
production (12-LOX inhibition), enhancing SPM signaling (upregulation of LGR6), or reducing SPM degradation
(downregulating of 15-PGDH).
Specific aims:
Aim 1: Determine whether inhibition of cardiac 12-LOX upregulation can reduce atrial NLRP3 activation
and AF burden in DM.
Specific Aim 2: Determine whether upregulation of cardiac LGR6 can reduce atrial NLRP3 activation and
AF burden in DM.
Specific Aim 3: Determine whether downregulation of cardiac 15-PGDH can reduce atrial NLRP3
activation and AF burden in DM.
Significance: This application explores new treatment paradigms of encouraging inflammation resolution to
prevent DM-induced AF. Using parallel experiments in humans and mice will provide mechanistic insights and
strengthen clinical relevance. A focus on prevention rather than treatment is novel and could prevent significant
morbidity associated with AF onset."
10809696,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a prototypical autoimmune disease. Lupus nephritis is the renal
involvement in SLE with predominate glomerulus damage and exhibits a wide variety of symptoms from
asymptomatic proteinuria to end-stage renal disease. Lupus nephritis requires aggressive immunosuppressive
therapy, however, unfortunately most of these medications are associated with severe side effects. Therefore,
development of new treatment strategies is essential.
 The goal of this proposal is to develop a nanoparticle delivery system that enables targeted drug delivery with
stable and sustained release of prednisolone at the glomeruli as a novel therapeutic approach for lupus nephritis.
Collagen IV (Col4)-α3,4 and 5 are expressed in the glomerular basement membrane (GBM), which is the only
site in the body that Col4 has direct contact with blood via fenestrated capillary endothelium. Liposomes are one
of the most widely used carriers due to their excellent biocompatibility and non-immunogenicity, but are lack of
stability in terms of leakage of the encapsulated contents. Tripolyphosphate (TPP) cross-linked chitosan
nanoparticles are characterized with controlled release of the loaded contents. Consequently, we hypothesize
that by coupling Col4 binding peptides on the shell of liposomes filled with TPP-chitosan nanoparticles, we would
make a kidney glomerulus selective delivery system with stable and sustained release of the loaded contents.
We further hypothesize that this system loaded with prednisolone exhibits highly therapeutic efficiency due to
the locally sustained drug release at a high concentration, meanwhile, it significantly minimizes the systemic side
effects due to the very low dose of total prednisolone administered."
10817692,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, multisystem autoimmune disease that can result in a serious
renal manifestation known as lupus nephritis (LN) and eventually, LN-associated end-stage kidney disease
(LN-ESKD). The development of LN-ESKD among patients with SLE is of particular concern due to its high risk
of premature death and its disproportionate impact on younger patients and patients of minority race and lower
socioeconomic status. There are only two treatment options for patients with LN-ESKD, and research suggests
that kidney transplantation provides a greater survival benefit compared to long-term dialysis. Despite this, the
majority of LN-ESKD patients are initiated on dialysis and it is largely unknown how soon after progression to
ESKD that the kidney transplant process is initiated and what socioeconomic and health system barriers may
hinder this treatment transition in this population. The kidney transplant process is complex for patients and
requires coordinated communication across multiple providers and health systems, including primary care
providers, nephrologists, dialysis facilities, and transplant centers. The overarching goal of this research
proposal is to characterize early access to kidney transplantation among adult (≥18 years) patients with LN-
ESKD in the U.S. by evaluating the impact of socioeconomic and health systems processes on the first step in
the kidney transplant process, referral for an evaluation at a transplant center. This research will leverage
national surveillance data of ESKD patients from the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) linked with
novel patient referral information from the Early Transplant Access Registry that is not collected in national or
regional surveillance systems to examine this critical and necessary first step to accessing a transplant. Aim 1
will estimate the timing of 1) kidney transplant referral from ESKD start comparing LN-ESKD patients to
patients with ESKD unrelated to LN, using Cox proportional hazards models. Aim 2 will evaluate the
association between neighborhood poverty and referral for kidney transplant in patients with LN-ESKD and the
potential mediating effect of visiting a kidney specialist prior to ESKD start. Aim 3 will use cross-classified
logistic multilevel models to determine the influence of health system factors (including dialysis facility and
transplant center characteristics) on referral for kidney transplant in patients with ESKD. The results from this
proposed research project will provide insight into the epidemiology of referral for kidney transplant in LN-
ESKD patients. Furthermore, it will inform clinical practice among clinicians treating patients with LN-ESKD by
emphasizing the importance of timely referral for kidney transplant to reduce patients’ time spent on dialysis
and death from other causes while on the waitlist. These results will also inform development of targeted
interventions to improve access to a nephrologist prior to progressing into ESKD and to enhance patient care
coordination across healthcare systems between dialysis facilities and transplant centers."
10934345,"Our objective is develop and rigorously validate a transformative technology that integrates cellular
functions/activities with their deep molecular signatures at single-cell resolution, in high-throughput.
Immunotherapy has emerged as a highly effective approach for the treatment of human cancer, and works by
harnessing the power of the immune system and its ability to recognize and eliminate cancer cells.
Immunotherapy has distinct advantages, including: (i) sustained and durable responses; (ii) defined mechanisms
of action; and (iii) higher specificity and fewer-off target effects than traditional approaches. Along with antibody
immunotherapy, genetically engineering T cells for redirecting immune responses has recently received Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. Adoptive cell therapy (ACT), based on infusing in vitro expanded T
cells bearing either T-cell receptors (TCR), or chimeric antigen receptors (CAR), have demonstrated dramatic
and durable responses, even in heavily pretreated patients. Despite these initial clinical successes, patient
responses vary widely. Recent correlative data indicate that variability in the manufactured T cell products may
be the primary determinant of clinical success. Since cellular infusion products are a heterogeneous mixture of
cells, mapping the complexity of the population requires the ability to identify the function and molecular profiles
of cells at single-cell resolution. There is an essential need for technologies that are able to map this complexity
in T-cell functionality and being able to link function to molecular profiles at single-cell resolution. We propose
the development and validation of Multiscale Intelligent Convergence (MusIC). MusIC will provide multi-scale
data from molecules to subcellular dynamics to cell-cell interaction biology on the same cells across thousands
of cells. Given the heterogeneity in the composition of cells being used for ACT, it serves as the ideal system for
the development and validation of MusIC. Our team of investigators has expertise in single-cell technology
development and immunotherapy, machine learning, and image analysis and data modeling. We anticipate that
the successful implementation of this proposal will enable the validation of MusIC as a platform for studying
multi-scale cell biology. This in turn, will lead to the more reliable biomanufacturing of T-cell infusion products,
and the engineering of more potent immune cells can have a broad impact on immunotherapy."
10806242,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Several aspects of early HIV-1 infection are both unusual and still poorly understood. In particular, HIV-1's
cone-shaped viral core consists of pentamers and hexamers of capsid (CA) protein and is known to be
metastable, undergoing restructuring and CA loss that is driven by and facilitates reverse transcription of the
viral genome. Yet only a relatively small number of host proteins have been both structurally and functionally
well-characterized in terms of how they bind to and influence core stability, and to date their binding strategies
all center around recognition of hexamers. This includes microtubule motor adaptor proteins, which HIV-1
exploits to indirectly engage motor proteins to regulate both capsid stability and transport to the nucleus. Our
recent work was at the forefront in identifying the Kinesin-1 adaptor for HIV-1 as Fasiculation and Elongation
Factor Zeta-1 (FEZ1) and determining that negatively charged amino acids in one of FEZ1's coiled-coil
domains mediate binding to the positively charged central pore of CA hexamers. While the structural basis of
its interactions have yet to be determined, others subsequently found that another coiled-coil domain protein,
Bicaudal D Homolog 2 (BICD2) acts as HIV-1's Dynein adaptor. Independently, we discovered that the
specialized microtubule regulatory protein, Cytoplasmic Linker Protein 170 (CLIP170) binds to HIV-1 cores and
in vitro assembled CA structures in a unique manner that is distinct from currently known co-factors.
Specifically, unlike hexamer-binding co-factors, CLIP170 binds to the extreme ends of wildtype CA assemblies
and also has a unique ability to bind and stabilize CA-R18L mutant assemblies, which form pentamer-rich
rather than hexamer-rich structures. Moreover, CLIP170 binds to the Major Homology Region (MHR) of CA,
which is structurally oriented inward and predicted to be inaccessible to cytosolic co-factors. However, cryoEM
imaging reveals that native HIV-1 cores contain breaks while we reveal unusual pentamer organizations in
R18-derived CA assemblies that create a pore which makes the MHR domain accessible from outside the
capsid. From this, we hypothesize that CLIP170 recognizes the MHR upon exposure by natural breaks in the
CA lattice of native cores or WT CA assemblies, or through previously unrecognized pores that form in R18-
derived assemblies, and functions to then control the HIV-1 metastable state. Furthermore, our data shows
that Dynactin 1 (DCTN1), a key component of the primary Dynein adaptor complex, Dynactin, also functions
independently to negatively regulate the pro-viral functions of CLIP170. We hypothesize that this makes
DCTN1 incompatible with HIV-1's goal of separately engaging motors through its hexamers while using
CLIP170 to regulate core metastability, and that this was an evolutionary driver for HIV-1 to instead use BICD2
to engage Dynein. In this proposal, we employ cutting-edge cryoEM, biochemical and functional approaches to
test these hypotheses and anticipate that our findings will provide new insights into host co-factors that control
capsid metastability along with a better understanding of why HIV-1 exploits less conventional motor adaptors."

Monoclonal antibody therapies now account for the majority of blockbuster drugs and the number and breadth
of diseases tackled by this therapeutic modality are expected to rapidly grow in the coming decade. However,
existing discovery technologies force users to choose between performance and cost. There is a need for
advanced discovery tools that provide a better functional picture of performance during initial high-throughput
screening. An ideal solution that can democratize antibody discovery would also be easily accessible, leveraging
existing equipment in pharmaceutical, biotech, and research laboratories. Partillion is developing and
commercializing a specialized hydrogel microparticle reagent (“nanovials”) that enables ultra high-throughput
sorting of single antibody secreting cells based on functional properties of secreted antibodies, all using standard
lab equipment and widely-available flow cytometers. Expanding on Phase I work and successful demonstration
of antibody discovery from plasma cells based on antigen-specific binding, in this Phase II proposal Partillion will
develop nanovial workflows to enable single-cell functional assays (binding of secreted antibodies to cell-surface
expressed targets and receptors that triggers signaling pathway activation) for our end users. These capabilities
can provide dramatic improvements in discovery workflows by minimizing the number of non-functional
sequences that have to be synthesized, introduced into cell lines, produced, and tested in large well-plate formats
downstream. Here we propose to develop on-nanovial functional screening assays for (i) binding to cell-surface-
expressed targets and (ii) receptor agonism, and benchmark the antibody sequences discovered with these
approaches against sequences recovered using standard hybridoma, and direct B cell Receptor (BCR) antigen
baiting workflows. Enabling more companies and institutes to access cutting-edge drug discovery capabilities
economically will also drive further development of therapeutic candidates for rare diseases and more crowded
“common diseases”, which ultimately will yield cost savings to the health systems and better outcomes for more
patients."

10804684,"7. Project Summary/Abstract
The encephalitic New World alphaviruses (NWAVs), consisting of Eastern, Venezuelan and Western Equine
Encephalitis Viruses (EEEV, VEEV and WEEV, respectively), are transmitted by mosquitoes through rodent
or bird hosts and have caused significant periodic epizootic outbreaks in equines and humans in the Americas.
NWAVs can cause severe neurological disease, with fatal encephalitis in up to 70% of cases, and significant
long-term sequelae in survivors. With recent climate changes, geological redistribution of mosquitoes carrying
NWAVs further enhances the potential for future outbreaks. Moreover, concern over their potential use as
bioweapons is well-founded due to their ease of production, high infectivity, ability for aerosolization, and
capacity to induce disease, resulting in select agent classification for E/VEEV. Despite awareness of these
viruses for nearly 100 years, licensed human vaccines against E/V/WEEV remain unavailable for general use.
The development of next-generation vaccines that can safely and effectively protect humans against these
pathogenic alphavirus infections are urgently needed. This project seeks to develop a cross-protective
recombinant subunit E/V/WEEV vaccine based on the linked ectodomain portions of Envelope 2 (E2) and E1
proteins of each NWAV adjuvanted with SLA-LSQ, a novel TLR4 agonist combined with the saponin QS-21
in a liposomal formulation. The proposed approach provides a means to deliver a safe and stable vaccine to
protect against infection by all three NWAVs using a scalable manufacturing platform that, in combination with
a proven Th1/Th2 balanced adjuvant, elicits a robust, efficacious and durable immune response through both
neutralizing and non-neutralizing means. The proposed NWAV vaccine is based on our highly immunogenic
and fully protective pre-clinical E2/E1 candidate vaccine for the closely related Chikungunya virus (CHIKV).
New preliminary data demonstrates that mice immunized with the NWAV E2/E1 subunits generate high NAb
titers to non-select agent strains of E/V/WEEV. The Specific Aims of this project are: 1) evaluate the
immunogenicity and optimize formulations of individual and combined recombinant E/V/WEEV subunit
proteins with SLA-LSQ adjuvant; 2) demonstrate the ability of the candidate vaccine to induce a durable
immune response in mice; and 3) demonstrate the cross-protective efficacy of the candidate vaccine in mice
upon NWAV challenge. Hawaii Biotech and the Baylor College of Medicine will collaborate to develop,
evaluate and advance this novel trivalent NWAV vaccine candidate. The development of a cross-protective
recombinant subunit vaccine to protect against all three pathogenic NWAVs would provide a valuable medical
countermeasure to safeguard against the considerable threat posed by these encephalitic alphaviruses."
10699009,"Pulmonary hypertension (PH), an increasingly common condition characterized by progressive remodeling of
the pulmonary vasculature, is an incurable disorder associated with significant morbidity and mortality. In a
large retrospective cohort of >100,000 veterans diagnosed with PH, we recently reported that PH related to
underlying heart (Group 2), or lung (Group 3) disease was most common and associated with the worst
prognosis. Strikingly, existing therapies for PH are neither effective nor indicated in these common PH
subgroups. Our preliminary studies highlight broad metabolic dysregulation in mice, rats, and subjects with
Group 3 PH. Because existing therapies fail to reverse underlying metabolic derangements that cause
pulmonary vascular cell proliferation and remodeling, this proposal seeks to better defining underlying
mechanisms of metabolic dysregulation in PH. Circulating platelets will be used as a unique biosensor to
study mitochondrial and metabolic dysfunction in PH. The PI will use bioinformatics to integrate the
experimental results with PH clinical features. We hypothesize that analysis of platelet bioenergetics and
metabolic function will reflect similar alterations in pulmonary vascular cells and serve as a metabolic
biosensor for evaluation of PH pathogenesis, progression, and treatment. This hypothesis will be examined in
two specific aims using sera, platelets, and pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMC) from
experimental and clinical samples. Aim 1 will explore critical hubs of metabolic dysregulation in
PASMCs and platelets isolated from PH rats. The Sugen 5416-hypoxia rat model will be employed to
isolate PASMCs and platelets from control and PH animals. The PI will be trained to characterize PH in this
model measuring hemodynamics, vascular remodeling, and right ventricular hypertrophy. Mitochondrial
function will be defined in PASMCs and platelets using an array of assays established in the mentor's lab.
Advanced metabolomics and isotope tracing for targeted metabolite analysis will be conducted under the
training of the Co-Mentor. Temporal changes in these parameters over time will be integrated with
hemodynamics and vascular remodeling. Aim 2 will examine mitochondrial and metabolic dysregulation
in de-identified platelets and plasma from clinically phenotype Group 3 PH patients. Platelets and
plasma from Group 3 PH, and age-matched controls will be subjected to mitochondrial and metabolomic
studies described in Aim 1. Bioinformatics approaches will elucidate if co-morbidities correlate with alterations
in metabolic hubs using multi-scale associations between participant characteristics, bioenergetic, and
metabolomic data. These findings will inform critical pathways of metabolic dysregulation that may be
therapeutically targeted to improve outcomes in PH. These studies and career development activities will
provide an exceptional foundation for the PI to become a successful, independently funded VA scientist to
improve the care and outcomes of veterans diagnosed with PH."

The threat of HIV among people who inject drugs (PWID) in the United States (US) is not over. Multiple HIV
outbreaks among PWID in rural and urban areas of the US have occurred recently, from 2015 in rural Indiana
to 2018 in Boston, Massachusetts. PWID who are racial/ethnic minorities continue to be disproportionately
infected with HIV. Among these, Puerto Rican (PR) PWID who started injecting drugs in Puerto Rico (PR) and
continue to inject drugs in New York City (NYC) remain vulnerable not only to HIV, but also to hepatitis C
(HCV) and fatal opioid overdose. Analyses conducted in NYC found PR PWID, especially those who migrated
from PR, are the most HIV-vulnerable ethnic group. In 2017, the US overdose mortality rate for US-born and
PR-born Puerto Rican PWID exceeded the rate for Non-Hispanic Whites, and the same holds true in NYC.
Recent research showed that PR PWID have significantly higher prevalence of HCV than non-PR-PWID, and
that PR-born migrant PWID have the highest HCV prevalence (86%) of all three groups. Helping PR-born
PWID avoid HIV will help prevent HIV outbreaks in NYC. Lowering their HCV and overdose risk will help
reduce overall HCV prevalence (67%) and overdose mortality rates (21.2 per 100,000) in NYC’s PWID.
In this 3-year study, we will develop an innovative and culturally tailored HIV, HCV, and overdose risk-
reduction intervention for migrant PR PWID in NYC that leverages the key migrant PWID role of the Ganchero,
frequently used “injection doctors,” and migrants’ strong social network ties. The intervention will be twofold: 1)
it will train Gancheros on the foundational HIV, HCV, and overdose knowledge required to, 2) deploy
Gancheros to disseminate evidence-based risk-reduction messages and resources and to implement safer
injection practices as they deliver their regular services to migrant PWID clients. The intervention will use a
wait-list control design with 10 Gancheros and 60 clients in two Bronx neighborhoods. Across two time-lagged
intervention implementation cycles (one per neighborhood, each consisting of a 6-session, small-group
Ganchero training and a 4-month deployment period) and five assessment time points, we will measure the
intervention’s feasibility (via Ganchero and client participation rates), acceptability (via Ganchero and client
Visual Analog Scale [VAS] ratings and qualitative feedback) and preliminary effectiveness in increasing
migrant clients’ rates of sterile syringe use (primary effectiveness outcome) and naloxone carriage (secondary
effectiveness outcome). Changes in Gancheros’ HIV, HCV, and overdose knowledge and personal drug use
behaviors will also be assessed before and after the training component. Ethnographic observations of
Gancheros deploying intervention strategies will assess fidelity of implementation, barriers, and Gancheros’
responses to barriers, to inform refinements of the intervention and its implementation strategy. If successful,
this intervention will reduce the high rates of HCV and overdose, and the significant potential for an HIV
outbreak. We will then evaluate the Ganchero intervention in a hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial (R01)."

10908456,"PROJECT SUMMARY: FULL PROJECT 1
Each year ~12,000 women ages 18-45 are diagnosed with breast cancer in the United States (US).
Overrepresentation of aggressive cancers, advanced stage disease at diagnosis, and inferior outcomes are seen
in this population of young women. Further, breast cancer mortality disparities in young women result in
increased early loss of life amongst women from low socioeconomic status (SES), those dwelling in rural areas,
and those from racial minority groups. Access to care, delays in diagnosis and treatment, and differences in
tumor biology partially explain these disparities. Identifying racially, geographically, and socioeconomically
diverse young women at high risk for breast cancer offers an opportunity to reduce cancer disparities
through early screening and detection of breast cancer. Integrating the use of existing breast cancer risk
assessment (RA) tools into clinical care is a means to identify these young women.
While RA is recommended for all women no later than age 30, this has not yet been translated to clinical practice
and thus women are not receiving RA prior to the age of 50 years when screening is recommended for those at
average risk. Women at high risk, in contrast, should start screening as young as age 25 (e.g., for those identified
to have a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation). As most women ages 25-49 years of age do not now receive RA, and
breast cancer in these women presents with a more aggressive phenotype at later stage associated with inferior
outcomes, implementation strategies for RA in this age group should be developed. If women ages 25-49 receive
RA and are identified as high-risk, they can be screened earlier than age 50 to diagnose cancer at an earlier
stage, when the disease is most successfully treated.
The central goal of the Breast cancer Risk Assessment: achieVing Equity (BRAVE) study is to reduce breast
cancer disparities by testing strategies to implement evidence-based breast cancer RA in a state-level public
health program that serves a racially and ethnically diverse population of low-income women. The BRAVE study
aims to assess the feasibility, reach, acceptability, and appropriateness of select customized strategies to
increase uptake of breast cancer RA. We will achieve these aims through conducting a novel, stepped-wedge
trial employing a mixed methods study design. The primary outcome is the proportion of women aged 25-49
having RA. Secondary outcomes include the numbers of women: 1) identified as high-risk; 2) pursuing risk-
adherent screening; and 3) diagnosed with breast cancer. Implementation outcomes include reach, feasibility,
acceptability, and appropriateness. Data collected will inform a future multi-site cluster randomized clinical trial
to test the implementation strategies on a larger scale over a longer duration, enriched for underserved
populations such as minority and rural dwellers."

Even though the growth of prostate cancer (PCa) is largely driven by androgens, a subset usually develops that
is refractory to androgen ablation (also known as castration resistant PCa; CRPC) with potential for metastasis.
Preliminary data from our laboratory has implicated fetuin-A, also known as alpha 2-Heremans-Schmid
glycoprotein (AHSG), in the growth of PCa cells and in the production of “uptake-competent” exosomes. The
objective of the proposed studies is to define the role and significance of fetuin-A in prostate cancer progression.
We hypothesize that PCa cells express ectopic fetuin-A which is secreted and taken up by the cells via TLR4 to
mediate the biogenesis of `uptake-competent' exosomes that promote PCa growth via activation of pAKT/pERK;
moreover, we postulate that elevated fetuin-A expression serves as a prognostic biomarker for PCa. Three
specific aims are proposed: Aim 1. To determine if fetuin-A expression is higher in AA PCa tissues relative
to Caucasian American (CA) PCa tissues and whether high fetuin-A expression is associated with high
Gleason Scores (>6) and enhanced pAKT and pERK. We will analyze mRNA expression of fetuin-A using
NanoString as well as pAKT/pERK protein levels using immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of human PCa
tissues. Multivariable linear regression analysis will be used to determine the correlation between fetuin-A, pAKT,
pERK and Gleason scores in PCa tissues of AA and CA patients, as well as other progression parameters such
as positive margins and spread of PCa. It is expected that fetuin-A, pAKT and pERK will be expressed at high
levels in PCa tissues of AA patients particularly those with high Gleason scores (>6). Aim 2. To determine the
role of ectopic fetuin-A in exosome biogenesis, promotion of 2-D and 3-D growth, motility and invasive
capacity of PCa cells. In this aim, we will overexpress and knockout fetuin-A in two PCa cell lines to determine
whether fetuin-A plays a causal role in the biogenesis of `uptake competent' exosomes that transmit growth
signals in recipient cells. We expect to demonstrate that exosomes from fetuin-A overexpressing cells will
promote 2-D, 3-D growth and motility and invasion of PCa cells while exosomes from fetuin-A null cells will not.
Aim 3. To investigate the efficacy of targeting fetuin-A mediated signaling on the suppression of prostate
tumor initiation and growth in mice. In this aim, we will utilize the Pten-null mouse model for PCa to determine
whether Pten loss requires intact fetuin-A gene to mediate its tumorigenic role and whether loss of fetuin-A in
Pten-/-/fetuin-A-/- double mutant mice attenuates the tumorigenic role of Pten-null. We expect reduced tumor
growth in the double mutant mice compared to Pten-null fetuin-A+/+ mice. Significance: There is an urgent need
to identify biomarkers that can differentiate CRPC from indolent PCa and this proposal addresses that need and
evaluates the process by which fetuin-A enhances PCa tumor growth."
10908462,"PROJECT SUMMARY: PILOT RESEARCH PROJECT
Immunotherapies can provide effective cancer therapy, but only in a minority of patients. The clinical success of
immune checkpoint inhibitors in some malignancies has not translated to ovarian cancer. Objective response
rates for single-agent immune checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) immunotherapy clinical trials in ovarian cancer are 6-
15%. Also, treated patients experience the consequences of dysregulated immunity from systemic administration
of these agents. For cancers in which primary disease is accessible/resected, or in metastatic disease in which
lesions are accessible, controlled release immunotherapy delivered locally may provide powerful – and systemic
– anti-cancer immunity. Most anti-cancer therapies, including CPI immunotherapies, possess dose-limiting
toxicities in non-target tissues that compromise outcomes. Restricting delivery of these therapeutic agents has
demonstrated benefit with the reduction in cardiotoxicity and significant improvement in therapy through
formulation of paclitaxel into Abraxane as a clinically powerful example. We propose to develop the first
controlled release biomaterials to enable local delivery of high dose immunotherapies that would be intolerable
if systemically administered. We aim to significantly improve the frequency and durability of response following
CPI immunotherapy. We hypothesize that lower intraperitoneal immune checkpoint inhibitor concentration in
humans, relative to rodents, contributes to the low efficacy observed for ovarian cancer immunotherapies in
clinical trials. Our proposed controlled-release CPI will allow assessment in mice of the intraperitoneal dosing
concentrations relevant to humans using a novel core/shell delivery system for sustained and controlled release.
The overarching objective of this pilot project is to test improved response to cancer immunotherapy through
sustained release of immune checkpoint ligands from biomaterials that are applied locally/regionally (not
systemically). Our multi-PI complementary team aims to test this hypothesis in a rodent model of human ovarian
cancer that aligns with the exploratory and feasibility objectives of this Pilot Research Project mechanism and
appropriate to lead to a full competitive project within 3 years. Aim 1 will synthesize and characterize biomaterials
that enable the sustained release of anti-PD-L1 and can be retained locally following intraperitoneal injection to
improve immunotherapy while minimizing undesirable side effects. Aim 2 will characterize ovarian cancer
progression, immune responses, toxicity and overall survival from the sustained release of anti-PD-L1 in the
intraperitoneal cavity of rodent models that replicate aspects of human disease."
10908463,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: PLANNING AND EVALUATION CORE
The Planning and Evaluation Core (PEC) will ensure that planning, monitoring, evaluation, and tracking of
partnership activities will be comprehensive to the needs of the Meharry Medical College/Vanderbilt-Ingram
Cancer Center/Tennessee State University Cancer Partnership (MVTCP), and utilize evaluation activities to
ensure that the MVTCP is successful in contributing to the broad goals of the Comprehensive Partnerships to
Advance Cancer Health Equity (CPACHE) program. The information we garner through our evaluation
processes will be used to guide the investment of resources into projects, programs, and institutional-level
strategies such as recruitment and leveraging of resources that support the goals of the Partnership. At a time
in which cancer health disparities and inequities in research and education remain as major barriers to improving
health and quality-of-life for all, ensuring that the efforts of the MVTCP are successful is paramount. Conducting
high-quality, continuous evaluation of the MVTCP provides the opportunity to document our efforts, measure our
successes, and attend to our weaknesses for the purposes of program improvement. During the past funding
cycle, the PEC worked with all cores of the MVTCP to develop logic models that are used to identify program
theory, as well as the measurable outputs and outcomes of each core. The metrics identified through this process
were then harmonized with the CPACHE-wide evaluation indicators to create an integrated outcome framework
designed to capture the broader impact of the MVTCP. In the next funding cycle, we will build on this work to
develop evaluation tools and processes to ensure high-quality implementation of funded projects, integration
among projects and cores, and dissemination of methods and findings that demonstrate the impact of the
MVTCP. The work of PEC will be guided by the following aims: 1) foster on-going coordination facilitated by the
Administrative Core, with the Internal Advisory Committee and Program Steering Committee to ensure the
MVTCP is receiving expert feedback and guidance on cores, projects, and the performance of the MVTCP as a
whole; 2) use a combination of established and innovative evaluation techniques to assess the MVTCP and its
accomplishment of short- and long-term goals; 3) develop a culture of evaluation within the MVTCP that is
committed to the use of data to support decision making, drive quality improvement, and inform dissemination."
10908467,"PROJECT SUMMARY: RESEARCH EDUCATION CORE
The goal of the Meharry Medical College/Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center/Tennessee State Cancer Partnership
(MVTCP) Research Education Program is to facilitate the growth and career development of a new population
of outstanding underrepresented minority (URM) cancer researchers. Our current Pathway to Discovery program
begins with cancer research education for high school students, continues for undergraduate Biology/Chemistry
majors at Tennessee State University (TSU) and culminates with support for graduate students (PhD, MSPH
and MPH) at Meharry Medical College (MMC) and TSU. The program also includes research support for medical
students at MMC and Vanderbilt University (VU). This program has proven to be very successful in supporting
the progression of a diverse population of students into cancer research careers. We propose to enhance the
efficacy of the Pathway to Discovery program by including psychosocial resources derived from social cognitive
career theory (SCCT). Research experience will engage students in the development and evolution of self-
efficacy (SE) as well as a sense of being part of the scientific research community [science identity (SI)]. SCCT
research shows that strong SE and SI are especially crucial to URM students entering and completing the
necessary programs to pursue research careers, including cancer research. We propose a program grounded
in SCCT that provides psychosocial resources and research experiences needed to develop and sustain SE and
SI. MVTCP is particularly suited to target African American and Latinx undergraduate students (at TSU),
graduate (at TSU and MMC) and medical students (at MMC). High school students come from two local STEM
magnet schools with predominant URM student populations. To achieve our goals, we propose the following
aims: 1) Provide psychosocial resources for high school (8 students, 4 juniors and 4 seniors) and undergraduate
students (12 students, 3 at each level freshmen through seniors) engaged in continuous academic year and
summer cancer research experiences to ensure development of SI and SE by leveraging the cancer research
and support resources at our Partnership institutions. Development of SE and SI will be accomplished by
providing opportunities for laboratory research and communities of practice (CoP) and a series of workshops
based in SCCT. 2) Recruit and support a diverse population of graduate students (2 MPH/3 PhD students each
year) who will evolve, strengthen and maintain a strong SI and SE as they engage in cancer research with the
ultimate goal of enhancing the diversity of the cancer research workforce. SCCT-based workshops and
resources targeted at the evolution and maintenance of SE and SI in our graduate students will be implemented.
3) Provide educational research opportunities, workshops and CoP to medical students (4 students each year
at MMC/4 at VU) to ensure successful evolution, strengthening and maintenance of their SI and SE and to
sustain their interest in clinical population sciences and translational cancer research with a focus on disparities."
10908474,"PROJECT SUMMARY: CANCER OUTREACH CORE
The Cancer Outreach Core (COC) will apply a community-engaged research (CEnR) framework to facilitate and
nurture integration and partnership between the institutions in our Meharry Medical College/Vanderbilt-Ingram
Cancer Center/Tennessee State University Cancer Partnership (MVTCP). The COC will engage with our
community partners to incorporate meaningful community engagement into research and outreach to ensure
that MVTCP activities are reflecting the needs and concerns of those populations that are most affected by
cancer health disparities in the 14-county Nashville Metropolitan Statistical Area. The overarching goal of the
COC is to facilitate the reduction of cancer health disparities by leveraging the strengths of community partners to
support and enhance cancer research and outreach efforts which will be addressed by the following Specific Aims:
1) enhance community collaborations to accelerate research and implementation of programs and policy
designed to reduce cancer burden and disparities; 2) facilitate strategic research and diverse/inclusive clinical
trial participation relevant to community needs; and 3) develop innovative outreach and education strategies to
support capacity building of MVTCP stakeholders. These aims will be achieved through the collaboration of the
COC with other MVTCP cores, through a robust Community Advisory Board (CAB), and through regularly
consulting with MVTCP research projects. Given the significant regional mortality disparity among Black (compared
to white) men with prostate cancer, a CAB member representing the Prostate Cancer Coalition of Tennessee
collaborated on the pilot work that led to the submission of a full project in this renewal on prostate cancer. The higher
regional rates of ovarian cancer led to the formation of an ovarian cancer support group established through a CAB
member, enabling ongoing support of a pilot project focused on ovarian cancer. During the last grant period, COC
helped to foster incorporation of dissemination and implementation science into the CEnR which contributed to the
full project in this renewal focused on breast cancer risk assessment. The COC will facilitate bi-directional
communications, bringing community input to the projects and disseminating results to the community. Furthermore,
MVTCP investigators leading research projects will provide presentations to the CAB and receive feedback on
presenting to lay audiences. With coordination through the Administrative Core, the COC will collaborate with
the Translational Pathology and Population Research and Clinical Trials in Cancer Equity Shared Resource
Cores to develop an educational module about biospecimen donation. With the Research Education Core
students will be engaged in community outreach utilizing new technologies aiming to reduce cancer disparities.

10908482,"PROJECT SUMMARY: PRACTICE SHARED RESOURCE CORE
The proposed Population Research And Clinical Trials In Cancer Equity (PRACTICE) Shared Resource Core
will build upon the infrastructure of the existing Clinical Trials Core (CTC) that has provided support to the
Meharry/Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center/Tennessee State Cancer Partnership (MVTCP) since its
inception. While the CTC has been instrumental in bringing clinical trials to the patient base at Nashville
General Hospital (NGH) at Meharry Medical College (MMC), to more completely address cancer health
disparities, we must augment these efforts with studies in prevention, early detection, treatment,
survivorship and palliative care in the Nashville Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), served by our
Partnership. We propose to establish the PRACTICE Shared Resource Core to further benefit the NGH
patient base, promote investigator-initiated research and extend the Partnership's reach to the underserved
in the Nashville MSA. The MVTCP has great strength in population sciences research that will enhance the
existing strength in clinical research. Examples include studies led by MMC, Tennessee State University
and Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center (VICC) investigators working with statewide cancer registries to recruit
for etiologic studies of breast cancer, lung cancer screening trials for early detection, a tobacco control trial in
the underserved, enhancing participant recruitment to cancer research and collection of biospecimens in
collaboration with the Cancer Outreach Core and Translational Pathology Shared Resource Core. There is a
rich history of conducting therapeutic clinical trials with interactions between the Clinical Trials Office (CTO) at
VICC and the CTO at NGH. The overarching mission of the PRACTICE Shared Resource Core is to enhance
accrual to therapeutic clinical trials while expanding access for minority and underserved patients to research
studies across the cancer care continuum. The PRACTICE Core worked extensively with Lucy Spalluto, MD
in the genesis of her proposed project examining the implementation of breast cancer risk assessment in
underserved women. We will assist with implementation of this study and dissemination of the results. Our Core
will also support other clinical and population-based science research across the cancer care continuum,
illustrated in three thematic domains focused on decreasing cancer health disparities: prevention and early
detection; interventional trials and observational studies during and following treatment; implementation of
healthcare interventions to improve cancer care delivery. The PRACTICE Core will address the following aims:
1) expand the portfolio of therapeutic clinical trials and cancer control studies relevant to the patient base of
NGH at Meharry and the Nashville MSA; 2) develop a cancer cohort at NGH at Meharry to serve as a resource
for future studies across the cancer care continuum; and 3) provide training and mentorship for clinical trainees
in the conduct of clinical trials and in the recruitment and retention of underserved populations in research."

Yale TMC aims to map cellular senescence in primary (bone marrow and thymus) and secondary (tonsil and
lymph node) lymphoid organs, which requires assembling a highly multidisciplinary team with diverse expertise
to characterize and understand cellular senescence and associated environments in human tissues. The
Administrative Core is led by Drs. Fan and Halene, whose have a long-standing record of active collaboration,
extensive experience in NIH consortium activities, and the management of large team projects. A program
manager will coordinate all administrative activities within Yale TMC and the communications with NIH SenNet
program staff. Specifically, the Administrative Core will fulfill the following key functions: (1) establish a
leadership plan and the operation structure to supervise and manage all research activities, set up a decision-
making procedure for the TMC’s governance, establish supervisory mechanisms to ensure effective internal
management of ongoing research and participation in SenNet activities; (2) establish the TMC coordination
plan including communications and collaborations between the Cores within Yale TMC, define and monitor
specific responsibilities of each Core, manage the pilot grant projects, evaluate progress and milestones, and
develop strategies to minimize confounding factors in data generation and sharing; (3) develop a SenNet
consortium coordination plan including participation in the steering committee to improve and implement
operation protocols, joining or creating new interest groups such as “spatial omics” and “immune cell
senescence”, make commitment to work with CODCC and other TMCs for protocol and data integration and
sharing, and mange trans-network collaborations. We will adhere to Network-wide policies and procedures
established by the NIH and the SenNet Steering Committee, including data access, publication, and intellectual
property policies. We will also abide by, Memoranda of Understanding and other sharing agreements
potentially needed for data and biospecimen sharing within the Network and other related programs. The
Administrative Core will develop outreach activities to enhance data dissemination and utilization by the large
research community to improve our understanding of cellular senescence, heterogeneity and associated
environments in development, aging, and disease."
10904916,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Core B (Biospecimen Core)
Primary (bone marrow and thymus) and secondary (tonsil, lymph node, spleen and others) lymphoid organs
are among the most dynamic tissues throughout an individual’s lifetime. The bone marrow gives rise to
hundreds of billions of cells each day, the thymus educates T-cells to recognize self and non-self and tonsils,
lymph nodes, spleen and others are key to daily defense against invading organisms and maintenance of
cellular homeostasis. Cellular senescence in these lymphoid tissues have been observed and presumably
associated with stress-induced or age-related functional impairment. However, what types or subtypes of
senescent cells are present and their spatial heterogeneity in in the tissue context as well as how these cells
impact the tissue environments remain poorly understood, highlighting a pressing need to map senescent cells
and the surround environments in these tissues and generate biomarkers to define spatial and phenotypic
heterogeneity in cellular senescence. The Biospecimen Core will fulfill a critical role in the Yale SenNet TMC to
procure, process, and histologically annotate lymphoid tissue specimens for further analysis in the Biological
Analysis Core to generate molecular and cellular maps of senescent cells. It will leverage and significantly
expand upon the Yale Hematology Tissue Bank’s existing structure and further leverage the existing
collaborations between Hematology (Dr. Halene), Pathology (Dr. Xu), Immunobiology (Dr. Craft), Laboratory
Medicine and YNHH Health Data Science (Dr. Schulz), and Surgery (Dr. Kodadek) to collect lymphoid tissue
and concurrent and longitudinal multi-specimen blood samples from healthy individuals. The Biospecimen
Core will collect, process, aliquot, catalog, annotate high quality tissue samples and distribute these to the Yale
SenNET Biological Analysis Core and SenNET investigators. The Biospecimen Core will leverage its existing
Freezerworks database to integrate all data from patient to tissue aliquot and link this data to clinical and
research databases in a HIPAA compliant and auditable fashion. The tissue specimens including tissue
sections and biofluids are further analyzed by the Biological Analysis Core and the specimen metadata will be
managed in the Data Analysis Core for integrated analysis and sharing."
10904919,"Project Summary – Core D (Data Analysis Core)
The Data Analysis Core (DAC) will build on available computational infrastructure to fulfill all the needs for
advanced data analysis and informatics of the Yale SenNet TMC. It will also provide support for data storage
and sharing, metadata management and referencing, web-based data portable and query, and rigorous
statistical analyses to accomplish the center’s missions. The DAC will be led by Dr. Yuval Kluger, who provides
prominent expertise bioinformatics and computational analysis of multi-dimensional data including sequencing
and imaging data. He has an extensive track record of methodology development and collaborative work in
studies analyzing data generated by genomics and proteomics technologies in major NIH consortia. Co-I
Gershkovich is directing Yale Clinical Pathology data infrastructure and management. He will provide prominent
expertise in building pipelines, frameworks and portals for integrating biospecimen metadata with biological
analysis data from multiple modalities including omics and images. He will develop a workflow tracking system
for specimen collection, annotation, analytic data, and sharing. The DAC will develop pipelines to analyze data
from 4 assay modalities in the Biological Analysis Core (BAC). Specifically, the DAC will carry out the key
functions for (1) data processing – to set up a set of multiscale and multimodal data processing pipelines and
quality assurance protocols, (2) data analysis – to establish an integrated single-cell & spatial data analysis
workflow and biomarker signature inference, (3) map construction – to construct tissue molecular and cellular
maps via image co-registration and multi-omics co-referencing, and (4) consortium coordination – to work with
the CODCC and other TMCs to develop common database, visualization, and query. The DAC will generate the
Molecular Maps and Cellular Maps of cellular senescence in human lymphoid organs, define cell type-specific
senescence biomarkers, dissect senescent cell heterogeneity, and delineate the interactions with senescence-
associated tissue environments. It will also assemble data standards, facilitate dissemination, and integrate our
data with existing or newly generated atlases and maps from SenNet and other NIH Consortia. These are highly
valuable next-generation biomedical data resources for a broad community of basic, translational, and clinical
research."

Cellular senescence in human primary lymphoid organs such as bone marrow (BM) and thymus, and
secondary lymphoid organs such as tonsil and lymph nodes (LNs) have been reported to show complex roles
in normal hematopoiesis, immune function, aging, and disease development. These organs are among the
most active, dynamic, and plastic physiologic systems. How cellular senescence is associated with stress-
induced or age-related functional impairment, what types or subtypes of senescent cells are present and their
spatial heterogeneity in the lymphoid tissues and how these cells impact the tissue environments remain poorly
understood, precluding the development of strategies to target these cells to improve healthspan/lifespan or
harnessing these cells or secreted factors to promote tissue remodeling and repair. Yale TMC Core C:
Biological Analysis Core (BAC) will deploy a suite of high-resolution, high-content and high-throughput single-
cell & spatial omics technologies to construct comprehensive maps of cellular senescence and the associated
environments in primary human cells and human lymphoid tissues. Four major biological analyses will be
performed: single-cell high-plex protein secretome profiling, single-cell proteo-transcriptomic sequencing
(scCITE-seq), spatial proteo-transcriptomic sequencing at cellular level (DBiT-seq), and spatial molecular
imaging (SMI) at single molecule resolution. Specifically, we will conduct (1) single-cell protein secretome
profiling of SAPS heterogeneity using induced senescent cell models and body fluids, (2) single-cell and spatial
proteo-transcriptomic sequencing to map senescent cells and environments in human lymphoid tissues. (3)
high-plex proteo-transcriptomic spatial molecular imaging of lymphoid tissues. We envision that the proposed
project will generate extensive multiscale, multimodality, and multifaceted data to characterize phenotypic,
functional and spatial heterogeneity of senescent cells in response to multiple inducers or modifiers, identify
biomarkers of senescent cell subtypes and neighborhoods, and construct maps and atlases of cellular
senescence and environments in primary and secondary lymphoid organs of humans over longitudinal time
frames, representing a highly valuable resource for a wide range of biomedical research."

10922706,"Acute respiratory illness is a major cause of hospitalizations in the pediatric population with over 75% of
admissions occurring in community–based (non-children's) hospitals. Focusing inpatient quality improvement
(QI) efforts on these conditions is likely to have a significant impact on outcomes. The Pediatric Respiratory
Illness Measurement System-Short Version (PRIMES-SV) tool is an abbreviated version of the previously
developed and validated PRIMES quality assessment tool. Using medical records data, PRIMES-SV
generates quality scores for both asthma and bronchiolitis, two of the most common conditions diagnosed in
children admitted to community hospitals. The overall goals of this study are to demonstrate the sensitivity of
PRIMES-SV measures to quality improvement (QI) interventions in community hospital settings, and to better
understand the contextual and provider-level factors associated with both the ability to improve performance
and to sustain those improvements.
 The specific aims of the study are: Aim 1. To implement the PRIMES-SV tool in six geographically diverse
community hospitals to a) examine the degree of variation in performance across the hospitals and b) identify
implementation barriers to high performance using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research
(CFIR); Aim 2.To a) conduct a QI collaborative and improve overall performance on a sub-set of PRIMES-SV
measures among the six hospitals by targeting CFIR-linked barriers with aligned strategies, and b) assess
whether improved performance is associated with decreased LOS and costs; and Aim 3. To a) assess whether
observed performance improvements are sustained on the targeted PRIMES-SV measures and b) determine
which CFIR factors are linked with sustainment.
 These aims will be accomplished by bringing together a diverse group of experts in the fields of QI
evaluation research, implementation science, and pediatric community-based hospital medicine. If using the
proposed approach to QI is successful and improvements are sustained, the PRIMES-SV quality assessment
tool used in combination with CFIR barrier-strategy matching could be widely disseminated to both community
and children's hospitals to facilitate quality improvement for these common and high cost pediatric conditions."

Abstract: Technical batch effects pose a fundamental challenge to quality control and reproducibility of even
single-laboratory research projects, but the possibilities for serious error are greatly magnified in complex, multi-
institutional enterprises such as the cancer molecular profiling projects being undertaken by the NCI Center for
Cancer Genomics (CCG). To aid in detection, quantitation, interpretation, and (when appropriate) correction for
technical batch effects in such data, we have developed the MBatch software system. MBatch proved
indispensable for quality-control “surveillance” of data in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and ongoing CCG
projects. But detecting and quantitating batch effects (or trend effects or statistical outliers) are just the first steps
in a process. The next steps involve detective work in collaboration with those who generated the data, drawing
upon expertise in integrative analysis across data types, pathways, and systems-level biology. That detective
work usually succeeds in diagnosing the cause of a batch effect as technical or biological. If technical, then
computational methods to ameliorate the batch effect can be applied (judiciously).
 The primary aim of the proposed Genome Data Analysis Center (GDAC) is to continue to translate that
successful quality-control model to the CCG’s other current and future large-scale molecular profiling projects
We will be ready to do that on Day 1. We will continue to enhance and extend the power of MBatch and
incorporate a number of innovative new algorithms, tools, and interactive visualizations into it (OmicPioneer-sc,
MutBatch, CarDEC, and CorNet). Evaluating and correcting batch effects is a complex process, so we will
collaborate with other GDACs and data generating centers to determine the influence of artifacts on any analysis
results they produce. The second aim is to contribute and enhance additional competencies. We are prepared
to (i) provide integrated cluster solutions to segregate cases into biologically relevant groups; (ii) provide tools
and expertise for high-level visualization of omic data (including single-cell data); and (iii) analyze RPPA
proteomic data from the subset of projects that generate such data. Our final aim is to communicate results and
distribute corrected data back to other network members, project stakeholders, and the scientific community.
 We bring a number of assets to the table, including multidisciplinary expertise in bioinformatics, biostatistics,
software engineering, cancer biology and cancer medicine; PIs with a combined 40+ years of experience in
molecular profiling of cancers; expertise gained in 10 years of doing the batch effects surveillance for TCGA and
other CCG projects; a highly professional software engineering team with a track record of producing high-end
bioinformatics tools; extensive computing resources, including one of the most powerful academic clusters in the
world; and close working relationships with first-class basic, translational, and clinical researchers across MD
Anderson, one of the foremost cancer centers in the U.S. The bottom-line mission of the GDAC will be to aid the
research community’s effort to understand cancer and to prevent, detect, diagnose, and treat it more effectively."
10872253,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Almost half of the over 1.5 million Medicare beneficiaries who enroll in hospice each year have Alzheimer’s
Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). Yet, hospice is poorly suited to the needs of persons with dementia
(PWD) and remains stuck in a model of care designed around the needs of people with cancer. This poor fit
has resulted in worrisome patterns of hospice use among PWD, including very long length of stay (LOS) and
high rates of disenrollment. Long stays are a problem because they increase Medicare expenditures on
hospice, which has skyrocketed from $2 billion to almost $20 billion between 2000 and 2018. Disenrollment is
a problem because it disrupts continuity of care, creating burdensome transitions for patients and caregivers.
PWD, in whom prognosis is notoriously difficult to predict, have the longest average LOS in hospice (151 days
versus 53 days in cancer) and are four times more likely to experience disenrollment after long stays in
hospice than enrollees with cancer. Hospice Payment Reform of 2016—the first change to Medicare hospice
reimbursement structure since its inception—changed hospice reimbursement from a single per diem rate to a
tiered model and was intended to de-incentivize long stays in hospice. While qualitative evidence suggests that
Payment Reform and other regulatory approaches have disproportionately impacted hospice use patterns in
PWD, the specific impact of Payment Reform on length of stay and disenrollment in PWD is unknown. The
objective of this proposal is to evaluate the impact of Payment Reform on LOS and disenrollment in PWD, key
outcomes of interest to both payors and patients. We will build upon our longitudinal 100% cohort of almost 1
million Medicare Beneficiaries with dementia enrolled in hospice between 2012-2017 to add a cohort of people
with cancer and additional years following Payment Reform. We will complement these quantitative analyses
with qualitative interviews with dementia caregivers and hospice staff. The aims are: 1) Assess the impact of
2016 Payment Reform on hospice length of stay and hospice Medicare expenditures in persons with dementia
versus cancer; 2) Assess the impact of 2016 Payment Reform on hospice disenrollment patterns and
outcomes in persons with dementia versus cancer; and 3) Characterize experiences and views of hospice care
for PWD in a diverse set of caregivers of PWD and hospice staff from a variety of organizational roles.
Knowledge from this study is necessary to the continued refinement of hospice policies and transforming end-
of-life care to meet the needs and trajectories of PWD and their caregivers, and will provide critical training for
Dr. Lauren Hunt’s development as a leading researcher in hospice and end-of-life care for PWD."

We seek support to continue our NW NARCH program, building upon successful experience with our earlier
rounds of NARCH funding for various research and trainee development projects. We bring many years of
collaborative experiences to the NARCH—including collaborations among Board-based investigators, OHSU
investigators (our primary academic partner), and Portland State University. Our Administrative core will help
facilitate activities among the three partners, and is organized to support the overall success of the Northwest
NARCH. Our NARCH activities are housed within the NW Tribal Epidemiology Center at the Northwest
Portland Area Indian Health Board, and the many years of experience of the EpiCenter will serve the success
of our NARCH program.
Our Administrative Core’s major activities will include:
1. To provide administrative leadership and oversight for the component NARCH 11 projects
 described in this application and align activities with existing NARCH training and research
projects;
2. To provide process and outcome evaluations for component projects within our NARCH 11 application;
3. To report NARCH progress to the delegates from the 43 NW tribes, to national NARCH project officers,
 to upper level administrators (deans and provosts) at the partner universities, and to Community and
 Scientific Advisors;
4. To seek out and disseminate information to collaborators on research and training opportunities for
 investigators, students, tribal health workers; and
5. To support investigators’ travel to the annual NARCH director meetings and scientific meetings.
Our administrative core team has worked together for many years on projects that have addressed regional and
national AI/AN health issues, and we look forward to collaborating again on the NW NARCH 11 grant. The
program that we have planned is consistent with the NARCH PAR, as well as the NIH Strategic Plan for
Tribal Health Research FY 2019-2023. We are excited to contribute to the health-related priorities

10902013,"Cancer Prevention and Control in American Indians and Alaska Natives: Project Summary
Few studies of cancer prevention and control or of cancer etiology among American Indians and Alaska
Natives (AI/ANs) in the US have included AI/AN people as investigators. AI/ANs in Principal Investigator roles
in cancer research have been particularly uncommon. Although many cancer control studies by non-AI/ANs
in tribal communities have been conducted with good intentions toward reduction of cancer incidence and
mortality, they have often failed to achieve a reduction in cancer-related disparities among tribal populations.
This lack of progress is partly related to the many challenges that 'outsiders' experience in working with AI/AN
communities, including the lack of trust that may take many years to establish. AI/AN investigators in key roles
in cancer control projects are clearly needed to more effectively address the cancer burden in AI/AN
communities, both reservation-based and urban. The rationale for the project is that well-trained AI/AN
researchers will have cultural competency and will be viewed as trustworthy and credible researchers by
community members who will participate in, or be affected by, research projects implemented by the AI/AN
participants in this program. Not only are the trainees likely to be working and living in their respective
communities, but they are more likely than non-AI/ANs to know the indigenous language and are more
motivated to stay in their communities long-term. Building on our earlier success in this area, our aims are:
1 ) to recruit and retain 40 qualified AI/AN researchers who seek additional training in cancer control research
and in the implementation of cancer control projects;
2) to design and offer a tailored three-week cancer control research curriculum using experienced and qualified
faculty and consultants, leading to a capstone cancer prevention research project for each trainee;
3) to provide follow-up support, including field support, distance learning opportunities, and mentoring to the
trainees after they complete the formal curriculum in cancer control research; and
4) to provide thorough evaluation of the program, and of each trainee as they work to achieve specific

graduate studies focused on cancer prevention.
We clearly need a larger federal investment in well trained AI/AN cancer control researchers who can bring

10902015,"Summer Research Training Institute for AI /AN Health Professionals: Project Summary
The overall goal of this project is to increase the research skill set of American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN)
health researchers who are capable of conducting biomedical, clinical, behavioral, or population-based
research in diverse settings. For this program, we will build on our successful record of research career
development implemented in the first, third, and fourth, sixth, and seventh cycles of NARCH funding. In this
grant, we will continue our innovative research training program and recruit AI/AN trainees, and provide long
term support for research projects, manuscripts, and grant applications that the trainees may submit during the
course of this grant.
Our proposal includes the following aims:
1. Recruit AI/AN health professionals, post-doctoral students, graduate students, advanced undergraduate
 students, health professions students, health-related researchers, and NPAIHB research staff into the
 Summer Institute, using already established advertising strategies.
2. Provide annual summer institute courses and workshops that will foster trainee research skills, adding
 new short courses each year and two new topic-driven, intensive training experiences each year, with
 topics depending on results of needs assessments.
3. Provide AI/AN role models for the AI/AN research trainees, including many new tribal faculty.
4. Provide financial and writing/editing support for attendance at local, regional, and national scientific
 meetings (new activity for special track students).
5. Provide outreach support for all Summer Institute graduate trainees in their development of research
 protocols and in submission of grants and manuscripts (new activity).
6. Evaluate the short and intermediate term success of the project and track the trainees as they progress in
 their careers.
Building on the success of our existing training programs for AI/AN students at the NPAIHB, Oregon Health &
Science University (OHSU), and Portland State University (PSU), we expect to meet our aims and further
promote AI/AN researchers in careers that are responsive to AI/AN health concerns. Thus, within the next
decade, a larger cadre of Native researchers will be better prepared to take a major role in research that will
lead to reduction in health disparities among tribal groups. In addition, the career development that the
summer program will provide to existing NPAIHB researchers will help to further establish our NARCH as a
regional resource center for tribal health issues and for meeting professional development needs."

 Social wellbeing and cognitive health are two pillars of successful aging, and they are interrelated. Three
decades of research have consistently shown that social isolation is associated with declines in cognitive
functioning. Although existing literature has explored the individual-level risk and protective factors, researchers'
attention has been less paid to the extent to which physical and social characteristics of the living environment
affect social isolation and cognitive health. The Ecological Theory of Aging (ETA) posits environmental factors
have significant influences on health and social wellbeing. Negative physical characteristics of the environment
were hypothesized to be related to increased social isolation and cognitive decline longitudinally. An increasing
amount of research investigated the association between ICT use and social isolation, yet whether ICT use
would interact with the effect of environmental factors on the risk of social isolation has not yet been empirically
tested. Besides, the influence of ICT use on cognitive health has not been well understood. Promoting social
interaction using technology-based approaches have the potential to alleviate social isolation among older
people and prevent cognitive decline. The proposed dissertation work (F99) will examine the effect of physical
and social environments of living on social isolation and cognitive health. The effects of ICT use will be
investigated within living contexts. Multi-level modeling and structural equation modeling methods will be
employed to conduct secondary data analysis using data from the National Health & Aging Trend Study (NHATS)
wave 5 to 9. The postdoctoral stage (K00) is guided by the overarching aim of building knowledge on the
behavioral and contextual pathways that could explain the association between social isolation and cognitive
decline and developing a community-based behavioral health intervention. At the K00 phase, the PI will increase
understanding of the social isolation and cognitive health research landscape by conducting a systematic review.
Longitudinal data from the ongoing Internet-based Conversational Engagement Clinical Trial (I-CONECT) will be
analyzed to examine the association between social isolation and change in neuropsychological outcomes. The
PI will utilize the longitudinal data collected with the Collaborative Aging Research Using Technology (CART)
platform to investigate the relationships between daily activities, social engagement, and the cognitive health of
older participants. Knowledge to be built at F99 and K00 stages will be synthesized to inform the participatory
co-design of a technology-facilitated intervention program for social isolation and cognitive decline. The proposed
research will produce knowledge on the influence of environmental factors on social isolation and cognitive
health, and achieve the PI’s long-term professional goal of developing behavioral health intervention to address
social isolation and prevent the onset of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias."

This D43 application “Building Research Capacity in Sociobehavioral Sciences in HIV Infection
in Tanzania” is a competitive renewal of two previous D43 awards to Duke University, now
transitioned to the Kilimanjaro Clinical Research Institute (KCRI) with Dr. Blandina Mmbaga
serving as Program Director. The objectives of this Program include assembly of an
interdisciplinary team of sociobehavioral and related scientists who study HIV infection. Past
and future trainees are gaining expertise in cross-cutting approaches to prevention strategies,
HIV testing, retention in care, adherence to antiretroviral therapy, related co-morbidities
especially mental illness, the needs of vulnerable populations such as children and adolescents
with HIV, and an aging population of persons with HIV in Tanzania. These topics are aligned
with priority areas identified by the US National Institutes of Health, the Tanzanian Ministry of
Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children, and the 2021 PEPFAR
Country Operating Plan for Tanzania.
Social determinants and human behavior including mental illness represent primary obstacles to
successful HIV prevention and treatment, and our team has and will continue to expand the
evidence base to address these obstacles. In the previous two funding cycles, this Program
has trained 23 researchers who returned to KCRI including 18 in degree-awarding programs,
and trainees have published 128 manuscripts and received numerous fellowships and research
awards.
Given the evolving Tanzanian HIV epidemic and institutional needs, in the next cycle, the
Program will add seven new members and further diversify the KCRI research team through
subspecialty training in Child and Adolescent and Geriatric Psychiatry for two physicians trained
in General Psychiatry, two PhD level Psychologists, and strengthen the team's ability to address
social determinants and community outreach capacity with two psychiatric social workers and
one occupational therapist. At the completion of the next cycle, this interdisciplinary team will
be a formidable enterprise with the expertise to research sociobehavioral sciences and HIV
infection at the vanguard of contemporary knowledge. In addition to these trainings, an annual
Sociobehavioral Sciences in HIV Infection Symposia will enhance interest across KCRI, the
Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Center (KCMC), the Kilimanjaro Christian Medical University
College (KCMU Co) and the community. In order to support former D43 trainees who have
completed their didactic training, this cycle will offer funds to support competitive mentored pilot
projects. Prevailing methods to strengthen team science including peer-to-peer and faculty
mentoring will be enhanced, and competitive mentored pilot grants, leading to an
interdisciplinary collaboration with robust and sustainable capacity compete for external funding
to address Tanzanian priorities in sociobehavioral sciences in HIV infection."

11124986,"Background
Cancer cachexia (CC) is a systemic, metabolic wasting syndrome featuring body weight loss due to skeletal muscle and adipose tissue wasting. CC is suffered by ~80% of cancer patients that causes reduced performance status, intolerance to chemotherapy, and increased mortality. This debilitating condition is poorly understood and has no effective treatment. If CC therapy existed, it would improve treatment responses, increase quality of life, and prolong survival. With 50 years of study, the field has focused on defining pathways that promote atrophy in the end-organs most affected by cachexia. While this work has been fruitful, it has not led to identification of the upstream mediators of CC, nor has it generated effective therapies. There is an urgent need for high-quality discovery science and more detailed clinical phenotyping. We have created a virtual institute comprised of diverse, international, multidisciplinary scientists and clinicians with expertise in cancer, metabolism, neuroendocrine function, immunology, human metabolic diseases, preclinical models, and clinical phenotyping. We hypothesize that CC is driven by tumor-intrinsic factors that activate neurohormonal sickness pathways, which then induce anorexia, metabolic dysfunction, and tissue atrophy.
Methods
Our approach involves sophisticated measures of host-tumor interactions including innovative investigation of (1) systemic metabolic flux in mice using isotope tracing, imaging mass spectroscopy, dynamic nuclear imaging, and dietary and pharmacologic interventions; (2) cellular components and secreted factors from the tumor microenvironment using imaging mass cytometry, patient-derived organoid xenografts, microbial toxins, and CRISPR-based manipulations; (3) central pathways regulating appetite, behavior, and peripheral organ metabolism using human metabolic phenotyping, optogenetic, and pharmacological methods. We will perform the largest, most comprehensive observational study in CC subjects to thoroughly define CC subtypes and their clinical biomarkers using epidemiologic tools, novel image segmentation algorithms, and cluster analyses.
Project Goals
Our vision is to develop mechanistically informed treatments for cancer cachexia (CC) to improve quality of life and life expectancy for patients. Working as a multidisciplinary team with expertise in basic science, clinical research, and epidemiology, we will establish a therapeutically relevant classification of molecular and clinical subtypes of CC. We will build therapies to normalize metabolism and neuroendocrine dysregulation in CC to enable successful anti-cancer treatment and systemic recovery for patients. In 5 years, we will have laid the foundation for a new generation of CC treatment trials and strategies that will, for the first time, deliver practice-changing evidence for improved outcomes for patients with cancer who are at risk of or suffer from CC."

Current treatments fail to cure many children with solid cancers. Recent advances in adult cancers such as checkpoint blockade and targeted small molecules have made little impact in childhood disease. Engineered T-cell therapies can achieve durable responses in refractory lymphoid cancers without long-term toxicity. These are precisely the characteristics required for new treatments for pediatric solid cancers. In contrast to hematologic malignancies, solid cancers are challenging due to a lack of targets, tumor heterogeneity, and hostile tumor microenvironment (TME). We posit that through advanced cellular engineering we can overcome these challenges. Our vision is that engineered T-cell therapy for childhood solid cancers will become routine within a decade. Our central hypothesis is that coupling of advanced cellular engineering along with progressive clinical development is the fastest route to developing effective T-cell therapies for pediatric solid tumors. In NexTGen, we combine detailed studies of primary tumors to discover new targets and understand how the TME subverts T- cell function. This, along with a closely coupled clinical development program will guide the progressive engineering of T-cells to result in transformative therapies. NexTGen is composed of 6 inter-connected work-packages (WPs) with work initially focused on pediatric sarcomas and brain tumors. AIMS: WP1: To identify suitable targets for engineered T-cells. WP2: To understand the TME in pediatric solid cancers. WP3: To develop receptors and other engineering components which target tumor cells and resist or modulate the TME. WP4: To evaluate the function of engineered T-cells developed in WP3. WP5: To translate approaches from WP4 and test them in clinical studies designed for maximal impact. Cancer Grand Challenges - Full Application - 2021 WP6: To promote data sharing across all WPs.

To model engineered cell function, WP4 will mostly use intact tumor models such as immune PDXs. In WP5, clinical product generation will involve autologous closed system semi-automated manufacturing. WP6 uses standard and custom databases and data sharing platforms. USE OF RESULTS: Tumor target and TME data from WP1 and 2 will be uploaded to databases developed by WP6 for widespread distribution. Engineering components from WP3 and functional data from WP4 will be available for incorporation into therapeutic T-cell strategies by the entire community.

10922710,"Understanding the contribution of copy number variants (CNVs) to human pathology remains challenging, in
part because of the complex and varied influence of loci within them. In some cases, a single dosage-sensitive
locus drives pathology. In other examples, multiple genes contribute to phenotypes through additive effects
and through complex genetic interactions. In the previous funding period, we focused on deletion syndromes
and reciprocal CNVs and asked whether we could develop tools to aid the identification of driver genes.
Progress in that work has informed several areas of pathology. For example, the identification of SIN3B as a
driver of a non-recurrent 230 kb deletion on 19p13.1 that causes a complex neurodevelopmental phenotype
reinforced the role of the Sin3/HDAC transcriptional corepressor complex in neurodevelopment and facilitated
the identification of Mendelian mutations that phenocopy the CNV. In the case of the 17q24.2 CNV, we learned
about the synthetic CNV phenotype likely caused by dosage imbalance of both BPTF and PSMD12. Finally,
modeling of multiple phenotypes associated with the 16p11.2 CNV showed how: (a) key neurodevelopmental
and craniofacial pathologies were conserved from humans, to mice, to rats, to zebrafish; (b) demonstrated
discrete epistatic interactions between loci; and (c) generated a host of surrogate model organisms in which to
perform both pathway analysis and drug discovery. Overall, the genetic and functional dissection of CNV
exemplars has underscored three observations: (a) not all genes in a CNV are dosage sensitive (suspected,
but now supported by experimental evidence); (b) some genes are dosage sensitive in one direction (gain,
loss, but not both); and (c) non-driver genes can participate in distinct genetic interactions. The knowledge and
experimental tools gained affords us the opportunity to expand our ambition. We still do not understand how
intra-CNV combinatorial dosage influences phenotype, and whether the lessons learned from prior work are
broadly generalizable. Moreover, given the non-trivial contribution of CNVs to disease burden, it is crucial that
we pay attention to the development of therapeutic avenues. We propose three Aims: (1) We will dissect a
unique set of CNVs, in which the phenotype is driven only by duplication to identify triplosensitive genes and
ask whether disease susceptibility is driven by a threshold effect as a means to understanding why only a
subset of human genes are dosage sensitive. (2) We will harness our existing zebrafish models to characterize
the molecular properties of epistatic effects using the neuronal and facial cartilage phenotypes of the 16p11.2
CNV and ask whether we can detect epistasis at the level of transcriptional regulation. (3) We will combine our
extensive repertoire of zebrafish models of CNV drivers with the Connectivity Map (CMap) Touchstone dataset
and a newly developed safety/efficacy protocol to identify candidate therapeutics. Together, our studies will
refine the genetic architecture of genomic disorders, inform the molecular basic of genetic interactions, and
chart a systematic path toward therapeutics for neurodevelopmental traits."
10917144,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This project aims to develop a culturally responsive technology tool for collaborative health research results
dissemination with diverse American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) communities. New methods and
technologies for respectful and culturally responsive research results dissemination are urgently needed both to
help researchers engage diverse participants and to serve those communities better. For many researchers, the
primary methods of disseminating research results are to submit manuscripts to peer-reviewed journals or
abstracts for conference presentations which essentially limits their audience to academic scholars. Limiting
dialogue between community stakeholders and researchers, many of whom may be unacquainted with
community perceptions of health or community systems of sharing information, decreases the likelihood that
study results will be implemented at a community level which can have a negative impact on community health
outcomes. Reliable health research information supports wellness but if that information is not presented using
methods that are understandable and contextualized, they have less benefit. AIAN people have experienced a
history of distrustful health research practice such as being exposed to procedures without informed consent
and having research results disseminated without community input or approval. Oversights like these increase
the need for transparency and accountability in research at all stages from project conceptualization to results
dissemination. Moreover, AIAN have been under-represented in large national health research initiatives—such
as NIH’s All of Us research program—or have not been consulted in meaningful ways about how best to
implement health research or disseminate actionable findings relevant to local community context. Though there
has been progress with community engagement in health research, only limited research has explored
collaboration specific to the results dissemination process. This study involves the co-design, co-development,
and evaluation of a stakeholder collaboration tool for health research results dissemination with AIAN
communities. For Aim 1, we will use value-sensitive design and user-centered design approaches to establish
value informed criteria to support activities for Aim 2A. In Aim 2A, we will integrate digital storytelling techniques
with participatory design methods to co-design low fidelity prototypes for collaborative results dissemination. Aim
2B will involve pilot implementation of a prototype designed with data obtained from Aim 2A which will be
evaluated for feasibility and acceptability in AIAN communities. Success in this research will result in improved
research communication and enhanced trust in health research which will increase the impact of health research
overall by ensuring that research outcomes are effectively disseminated to AIAN communities. This will support
the community in understanding and possibly incorporating research recommendations."
10874443,"Bioprosthetic heart valves (BHV), fabricated from heterograft biomaterials such as glutaraldehyde-fixed bovine
pericardium (BP), are widely used as a replacement for patients who have severe heart valve disease (HVD),
which affects millions of people worldwide. Despite being effective, a limitation of BHV fabricated from BP is
that they undergo structural valve degeneration (SVD) which limits durability. Although most commonly
attributed to calcification, recent research has shown that advanced glycation end products (AGE) and serum
protein infiltration also contributes to SVD. AGE mechanisms impair endothelial cell growth and may
mechanistically contribute to lack of endothelialization of BHV experimentally and clinically. Many studies to
inhibit calcification of BP have been done; however, strategies to mitigate AGE-serum protein accumulation
have just begun to be explored. Through our studies we have recently identified, the AGE-inhibitor
pyridoxamine (PYR), a vitamin B6 vitamer, to be a leading model compound that is effective in significantly
reducing AGE accumulation and serum protein uptake of BP both in vitro and in vivo in rat subdermal implant
studies. Furthermore, we have also established an innovative modification of BP with Poly-2-methyl-2-
oxazoline (POZ), which significantly reduced serum protein uptake both in vitro and in rat subdermal explants.
The central hypothesis of both my dissertation and this proposal is: Pretreatment of BP with PYR and POZ can
mitigate AGE and serum protein pathophysiology that contributes to noncalcific SVD mechanisms. Ethanol
(EtOH) pretreatment of BP, an FDA approved anti-calcification methodology, will be a mechanistically based
experimental intervention in my study design, that will help explore the interactions between calcific and non-
calcific SVD mechanisms. Aim 1: Investigate in vitro the mechanism and efficacy of inhibition of AGE and
serum protein infiltration to enhance heterograft biocompatibility by studying endothelial cell-BP interactions.
Subaim 1a: Evaluate the effects of PYR pretreatment of BP to mitigate AGE and serum protein mechanisms:
blood outgrowth endothelial cell (BOEC) culture studies with high shear flow simulation. Subaim 1b: To
determine the effect of POZ mediated serum protein exclusion on promotion of BOEC adhesion and reduction
of endothelial activation. Aim 2: To investigate the mechanism and efficacy of inhibition of AGE and serum
protein SVD pathology, and interactions with calcification using rat subdermal BP implants: PYR and POZ
studies. Subaim 2a: To study the efficacy of PYR pretreated BP, with or without ethanol pretreatment, on
mitigating AGE-serum protein pathophysiology and calcification using a rat subdermal implant model. Subaim
2b: To study the efficacy of POZ alone, and the combined BP pretreatment with PYR, POZ, and ethanol for
mitigating AGE, serum protein uptake and calcification in the rat subdermal implant model. The findings from
this proposal will advance my research training and contribute to advances in our knowledge of SVD of BHV."
10809735,"Project summary:
 Chimeric antigen receptor T (CART) cells have transformed the cancer therapy paradigm by genetically
engineering a patient's own T cells to specifically kill cells expressing the targeted antigen, such as CD19 for B
cell malignancies. CART cell proliferation and formation of memory CART cells result in complete B cell
depletion and durable remission of otherwise refractory B cell cancers. We re-designed CART technology for
autoimmune disease therapy by utilizing an autoantigen as the extracellular domain of a chimeric autoantibody
receptor (CAAR), linked to cytoplasmic T cell receptor costimulatory and activation domains. CAARs direct T
cell cytotoxicity against autoantigen-specific B cells by targeting their B cell receptor, a surface-bound
autoantibody identical in specificity to the autoantibody the B cell will secrete once activated to mature into a
plasmablast. We established proof-of-concept for CAAR safety and efficacy in experimental models of
pemphigus vulgaris (PV), a potentially fatal blistering disease caused by autoantibodies to the epithelial
adhesion protein desmoglein 3 (DSG3). If CAARs for autoimmunity prove to be as effective as CARs for B cell
cancers, CAAR T cells could represent a one-time treatment leading to autoimmune disease cure.
 An open-label, dose-escalation, first-in-human phase 1 trial to determine the safety and tolerability of
DSG3 CAAR T cell therapy (DSG3-CAART) in mucosal-dominant pemphigus vulgaris has been initiated.
DSG3-CAART is the first precision cellular immunotherapy for autoimmune disease to enter clinical trials,
which presents a unique opportunity to define the immunomodulatory effects of this novel therapeutic approach
in humans. DSG3-CAART is designed to specifically eliminate DSG3-reactive memory B cells that replenish
the autoantibody-producing plasmablasts in PV. Depletion of anti-DSG3 memory B cells could remove a key
driver of DSG3-specific T cell activation, and DSG3-CAART persistence may induce changes in global T cell
subset composition and/or cytokine milieu, resulting in dual mechanisms for disease remission through both
the B and T cell compartments. The proposal will evaluate the hypothesis that DSG3-CAART will reset immune
tolerance in PV by depleting DSG3-reactive B cells and normalizing pathologic T cell subsets, potentially
leading to safe and lasting disease remission."
10873722,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) are a growing concern in industrialized and newly developing countries as
the environment, lifestyles, and diets change. IBD involves a complex interplay between the host's
environment, diet, genetics, and gut microbiota, each necessary but insufficient to cause disease. However, it
is unclear what initiates these diseases, what the relative contributions of these factors play in the
pathogenesis of IBD, and what makes these diseases chronic. Current therapies are still imprecise, and
preventative disease strategies for high-risk patients are non-existent. Some evidence suggests that changes
in the gut microbiota can influence the risk and trigger IBD. Our lab uses a human model involving ulcerative
colitis(UC) patients who undergo colectomy followed by creating an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA). In
theory, IPAA should be curative, but nearly half of these patients develop an inflammatory condition of the ileal
pouch called pouchitis, whereas non-IBD patients undergoing the same procedure rarely develop pouchitis.
These patients were followed and sampled longitudinally, and metagenomic data shows blooms of pathobionts
such as Bacteroides fragilis before and during the development of pouchitis. Upon antibiotic-induced
remission, the relative abundance of B. fragilis decreased, implicating it as a potential trigger and sustainer of
pouchitis. The proposed research strategy tests the hypothesis that pouchitis-associated pathobionts (PAP)
like Bacteroides fragilis cause in IPAA-associated pouchitis. Notably all the B. fragilis strains cultivated from
UC pouchitis patients are non-enterotoxigenic strains that were present even before the IPAA was
performed. Thus, we believe that insight gained through these studies will directly relate to the
etiopathogenesis of human IBD. As a counterpart to the human pouchitis model, we employ germ-free (GF)
and SPF (specific pathogen-free) wild-type (WT) and IL10 knockout (IL10-/-) mice where engraftment of PAP B.
fragilis in the latter is associated with increased incidence and severity of colitis. I will determine whether B.
fragilis promotes colitis directly and/or indirectly by causing perturbations in the membership and function of the
indigenous colonic microbiota. SPF, but not GF, IL10-/- mice are genetically predisposed to developing IBD.
Human PAP B. fragilis strains readily engraft into SPF IL10-/- mouse microbiota, but not that of WT mice, and
promote the development of colitis. Using Bulk-RNA Sequencing analysis and flow cytometry, I will evaluate
how the presence of B. fragilis alters the host's immune responses and gene expression in the GI tract of GF
and SPF IL-10-/- mice. Fecal samples, regional intestinal luminal, and mucosal content will be subjected to 16S
rRNA, metagenomic, and metabolomic analyses to assess if B. fragilis leads to dysbiosis–promoting chronic
colitis in the IL10-/- mouse model. This study provides critical insight into the events prior to the development of
chronic inflammation in an IBD-susceptible host. In addition, these studies will shed light on potential
biomarkers that can predict risk, help define preventative strategies, and guide therapeutic management."
10884191,"Project Summary
Bidirectional transport is essential for cargo trafficking in cells and is required for proper growth and cell division.
Kinesin and dynein are microtubule motors responsible for bidirectional cargo transport in cells. Defects in
microtubule motor-based transport are linked to many neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s,
Parkinson’s, spinal muscular atrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington’s disease; thus,
understanding the mechanisms underlying bidirectional transport is crucial to understanding transport
deficiencies in disease states and developing potential treatments. Despite important advances in understanding
the mechanochemical properties of individual motors, many questions remain regarding how motors work as
teams, and how kinesins and dyneins coordinate with one another. A widely supported model for bidirectional
transport is the ‘tug-of-war’ model in which teams of dynein and kinesin pull in opposite directions and the winning
team determines the direction of transport. However, this model cannot account for the motor coordination and
other regulatory factors involved. Previous modeling work identified the load-dependent detachment rate as the
key parameter that determines whether kinesin or dynein wins in a motor tug-of-war, and recent experimental
and theoretical work showed that vertical force inherent to widely used single-bead optical tweezer geometry
significantly accelerates motor detachment rates. Consistent with this, when kinesin and dynein were connected
through DNA linkages such that forces are only parallel to the microtubule, these two-motor complexes remained
attached for much longer times than seen in optical tweezer experiments. The first goal of this project is to
establish a novel technique that uses ssDNA as a pN-scale spring, to accurately determine motor stepping
characteristics in the absence of vertical forces, mimicking physiological conditions. Aim1 will test the ability of
transport kinesins and the dynein-dynactin-BicD2 complex to maintain stepping against a hindering load oriented
solely parallel to the microtubule. Initially, motors will be tracked with a fluorescent probe via TIRF microscopy,
and later a gold nanoparticle will be used to track in high resolution the load-dependent transitions in the kinesin
stepping cycle. Aim 2 will use a DNA origami scaffold to pair gold nanoparticle-labeled kinesin and dynein
together and track them via Interferometric Scattering (iSCAT) microscopy. The motor dynamics underlying the
bidirectional transport trajectories will be interpreted using a computational model of kinesin-dynein transport. In
Aim 3, teams of motors will be tracked to test how assisting and hindering loads inherent to multimotor
geometries affect the competition between kinesin and dynein teams. Uncovering the motor dynamics underlying
these complex multimotor systems is essential for understanding how intracellular bidirectional transport ensures
that specific cargoes are reliably transported to their proper locations in neurons and other cells."

Optimal decision-making requires a delicate balance of stability and flexibility. On the one hand, stability is
required to exploit learned contingencies between environmental features, instrumental actions, and goals. On
the other, flexibility is required for the acquisition of a new behavioral strategy when the contingencies change.
Dopamine (DA) neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) have been implicated as important regulators of
this balance. Conditions associated with DA dysfunction–most notably schizophrenia, Parkinson’s, and
Huntington’s disease–profoundly disrupt performance on tasks requiring behavioral flexibility, such as the
Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, typically by increasing “perseverative” responses that track a previously learned
feature that is no longer relevant. Numerous animal studies have also directly implicated DA in the capacity to
shift strategies, using pharmacological interventions, DA depletion, and microdialysis in important projection
targets of VTADA neurons. Moreover, VTADA stimulation can promote either the maintenance or reorganization
of behavioral strategy depending on whether it is timed to mimic tonic or phasic modes of firing. However,
little is known about the endogenous neural activity patterns that underlie the acquisition of a new strategy–in
part, because its anatomical location deep within the brain has kept the VTA inaccessible to large-scale
recording during behavior. We have developed a decision making paradigm for mice that requires a strategy
shift and can be performed under a two-photon microscope, allowing the use of state-of-the-art deep-brain
imaging techniques to simultaneously monitor VTADA activity at cellular resolution. In this task, subjects
navigate a T-maze within a virtual reality environment. The reward location is determined by one of two rules:
a sensory rule guided by visuospatial cues, or an alternation rule guided by the previous choice. After initial
training on one rule, subjects are challenged with a rule shift that enforces the acquisition of a new strategy.
The recent discovery of heterogeneous task-feature representations within the VTADA population–a finding that
contradicts the standard view that VTADA broadcasts a global reward prediction error signal–has inspired us to
use this paradigm to test an intriguing hypothesis: that the RPE is represented in multiple feature-specific
components–rather than as a global signal–and that subsets of the VTADA population track specific features
based on their relevance to the current task strategy. Thus, the research plan outlined in this proposal will
allow the first characterization of endogenous VTADA activity during a shift in behavioral strategy, and may help
to clarify the link between DA and theories of reinforcement learning. The results are expected to have broad
relevance to decision-making, and may uncover specific mechanisms that link dopamine dysfunction to deficits
in flexibility."
10817690,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Signaling pathways pattern cell fate choices in the developing embryo, but how do only a limited number of
pathways control the complex events of development? Spatial signaling gradients as well as temporal signaling
dynamics are known to be important for directing multiple fates with the same pathway, yet the mechanisms
cells use to interpret these signaling events remains largely uncharacterized. One pathway which plays diverse
roles throughout embryogenesis, wound healing, and cancer progression is the highly conserved extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (Erk) signaling network. The early Drosophila embryo is a classic in vivo model of
tissue patterning by Erk signaling: a spatial gradient of Erk signal at the poles specifies anterior and posterior
structure and dictates endoderm versus ectoderm fate decisions. Although these patterns are well-defined,
recent work in the Toettcher laboratory using an optogenetic tool to manipulate the Erk signal in vivo with
exquisite spatial and temporal precision has revealed major open questions about the mechanisms by which
Erk signals are interpreted. Here, I propose to define the mechanisms by which the Drosophila embryo
interprets differences in Erk dose to create spatial patterns of gene expression and make decisions about cell
fate. To address this question, I will use a combination of cutting-edge optogenetic tools, live-cell biosensors,
genomic analysis, and classical genetic perturbations. In Aim 1, I will examine how spatial patterns of gene
expression are robust to major corruption of the Erk gradient. In Aim 2, I will explore how only two transcription
factors can control multiple distinct fates over a wide range of Erk signal strength. Altogether, using precision
tools for manipulating signaling inputs and quantifying expression outputs, this proposal will reveal how Erk
signals are measured and interpreted by downstream genes, addressing a fundamental question in
developmental biology which will surely have relevance for other signaling pathways and cellular contexts for
Erk signaling. Through this research and the accompanying training plan I will obtain exceptional training in
optogenetics, advanced microscopy, and genomics, positioning me for an impactful career at the interface of
cell and developmental biology."
10861746,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is characterized by problematic alcohol consumption that evolves over an
individual’s drinking history. While initial alcohol use is thought to be driven by its positive reinforcing effects,
following long-term drinking, negative affective states emerge during withdrawal. These states are associated
with increases in alcohol seeking, tolerance, and levels of consumption that follow repeated bouts of
abstinence. This has led to the hypothesis that negative reinforcement becomes the primary motivational
drive – where individuals consume alcohol to alleviate these negative states. However, the circuit-based
mechanisms that control this switch to negative reinforcement are unclear. The goal of this proposal is to
outline how alcohol-associated cues recruit circuits that control negative reinforcement before and after chronic
alcohol exposure. Our preliminary data show that D2 medium spiny neurons (MSNs) are a critical a negative
reinforcement circuit and control the motivational drive to avoid aversive stimuli in an environment. This
proposal will test the hypothesis, that alcohol-associated cues recruit D2 MSNs activation in vivo and drive
drinking after chronic exposure to alcohol. By combining optical approaches to record from and bidirectionally
modulate D2 MSNs in the NAc during alcohol drinking I will define exactly when and how their activity is
recruited over a history of drinking and how it controls drinking behavior. In Aim 1& 2, I will optically inhibit or
activate D2 MSN activity at the time of an alcohol-predictive cue to determine how this controls operant
drinking before and after chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) exposure. In Aim 3, I will determine if the dynamics
of D2 MSNs during operant alcohol drinking are predictive of specific drinking patterns by combining fiber
photometry with operant behavior and doing deep-phenotyping analysis. I hypothesize that D2 MSNs – which
function as a negative reinforcement signal – are recruited by alcohol associated cues only after a history of
CIE exposure, when alcohol use is driven by negative reinforcement.
 Taken together, the experiments in this proposal will determine the negative reinforcement circuits that
are recruited in the later phases of alcohol drinking and whether the dynamics of these neuronal circuits could
be predictive of alcohol drinking phenotypes. This proposal encompasses technical and theoretical training that
will provide the foundational expertise and conceptual thinking needed to address larger questions regarding
how long-term exposure of alcohol changes the brain and drives continued alcohol use. Additionally, these
findings can ultimately inform our understanding of underlying reward and learning process and lead to more
efficacious treatment interventions for AUD."

Neonatal hypoxia/ischemia can result in severe damage to the infant brain. Reestablishing blood flow and
oxygen delivery (reperfusion) is crucial for survival. However, reperfusion induces an accumulation of reactive
oxygen species (ROS) produced by the mitochondria, culminating in oxidative stress and irreversible tissue
damage. Current studies suggest that cardiolipin (CL) and its remodeling via oxidative injury to
monolysocardiolipin (MLCL) directly participate in activation of mitophagy and lipidic pore formation to regulate
cytochrome c release and facilitate induction of programmed cell death. The objectives of this research proposal
are to investigate of the roles of CL and CL modification as molecular mechanisms in hypoxic brain injury. Aim
1 will focus on establishing the clinical relevance of CL modification and investigate the role of CL modification
in brain injury following HIE. Utilizing the cutting-edge technology of cyclic ion mobility spectrometry mass
spectrometry (cIMS-MS) CL and its isoforms will be quantitatively analyzed following hypoxia/ischemia in a
neonatal piglet model of HIE. Unlike traditional mass spectrometry, cIMS-MS separates molecules based on
structure as well as mass to charge ratio (m/z) allowing detailed analysis of CL species and to directly investigate
its remodeling in I/R injury. Several novel transgenic mouse-lines will also be used to manipulate CL biosynthesis
and remodeling in vivo. Mouse pups will be exposed to hypoxia/ischemia, then brains will be analyzed for injury
to evaluate the contribution of CL modification on outcomes following HIE. Aim 2 will further explore the
mechanisms regulated by CL modification following hypoxia/ischemia, including disruption to the mitochondrial
network through mitophagy and mitochondrial dynamics. Mitophagic flux will be characterized in primary culture
from mice possessing the mitochondrial quality control (mitoQC) reporter and disruptions to mitochondrial
morphology will be assessed with our cutting-edge machine learning based quantification methodology. Finally,
the mitochondrial specific antioxidant mitoTEMPO and phospholipase inhibitors will be used in combination with
our genetic mouse models to define the contribution of oxidative modification and lipolysis to CL modification
following hypoxia/ischemia. Together, these experiments will establish the mechanism of post-hypoxic CL
modification, interrogated the casual role of CL and MLCL in the progression of brain injury , and define potential
therapeutic targets. With exceptional scientific mentorship and rigorous academic study, this research will
develop a deeper understanding of the role lipidomics play in HIE. This project will allow extensive training and
allow me to gain expertise in a diverse range of animal models and molecular analysis of mechanisms of brain
damage. The proposed project creates a unique environment to foster the development and critical thinking of a
young scientist."
10820140,"Project Summary
The goal of this proposal is to elucidate the molecular mechanism of eukaryotic divergent transcription at
bidirectional promoters. Divergent transcription, defined as sense and antisense transcripts generated from a
common promoter, offers an additional mode of transcriptional regulation. This phenomenon has been observed
to be nearly ubiquitous and necessary for cell survival. Strand-specific sequencing methods such as global run
on sequencing and nascent elongation transcription sequencing have estimated that over 70% of active
promoters from yeast to humans exhibit divergent transcription. This is likely an underestimate as divergent
transcript pairs have been shown to be regulated and thus appear unidirectional. Additionally, of the divergent
transcript pairs, knockdown of non-coding antisense transcripts results in improper lung, heart, and brain
development. The current model for divergent transcription is that an active promoter generates a transcription
permissible state where a single Med-PIC assembles, releases a single pol II which produces a sense or
antisense transcript and then disassembles, thereby clearing space for assembly of another single PIC to repeat
the process. This model is supported by previous structural studies of Med-PIC that utilized a shortened DNA
template lacking a complete and endogenous complement of upstream activating sequences (UAS) or in the
absence of activator proteins. In my initial study, I investigated the assembly of the PIC on a natural bidirectional
promoter by utilizing a DNA template comprising an entire nucleosome-free promoter region (NFR) with UAS(s)
and flanking core promoters. Importantly, this promoter architecture is where divergent transcription typically
occurs. Interestingly, I observed that two PICs dimerize in vitro via the coactivator Mediator, hereinafter called
dMed-PIC in an activator protein dependent manner. In Aim 1, I will resolve a structurally comprehensive view
of dMed-PIC using a novel and hybrid approach of cryo-electron microscopy single particle analysis (cryo-EM
SPA) and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET). I will determine the assembly pathway towards divergent
transcription and thereby reveal possible regulatory mechanisms by solving the structure of dMed-PIC. In Aim
2, I will investigate transcription by dMed-PIC in vitro by yeast whole cell extract transcription assays. These
proposed experiments will use technically innovative approaches to advance our understanding of the novel
dMed-PIC and its function in divergent transcription."

Intranasal vaccination and respiratory virus infection induces populations of antigen specific B cells and T cells
in mucosal tissues. The resulting memory T cells recognize internal epitopes that are conserved across viral
strains and can provide protection against antigenically novel, potentially pandemic variants. One subset of
memory T cells includes tissue resident memory T cells (TRM) which are poised to provide rapid immune
responses at the site of pathogen entry. Numerous studies using direct intranasal inoculation have demonstrated
that CD8 TRM in the respiratory tract can mediate protection against heterosubtypic influenza strains. However,
the ability of CD8 TRM to limit natural respiratory virus transmission has not been defined. Because murine
adapted influenza viruses do not readily transmit between mice and immunological reagents for ferret and guinea
pig models are limited, studying the immunological mechanisms behind transmission has been significantly
hindered. To bridge this gap in knowledge, we developed a murine model using Sendai virus, a mouse
parainfluenza virus which naturally transmits between mice. Through the use of a Luciferase encoding Sendai
virus, transmission dynamics can be evaluated by in vivo imaging. Our preliminary data demonstrates that
Sendai virus specific CD8 TRM in the respiratory tract limit transmission of Sendai virus to immunized contacts.
We seek to further define the mechanisms underlying this TRM mediated protection against transmission by
evaluating relative contributions of TRM in different anatomical compartments of the respiratory tract. Because
studies have demonstrated that a decline in lung and airway TRM corresponds to a loss of heterosubtypic
immunity, we will evaluate the durability of TRM mediated protection following various vaccination strategies.
Furthermore, we will investigate the TRM antiviral mechanisms that limit transmission with a focus on cytokines
and cytolytic proteins. Understanding cellular immune mechanisms in respiratory virus transmission will impact
future vaccine development designed to prevent respiratory virus outbreaks."

Epitranscritomics is the study of RNA modifications, which include more than 170 naturally occurring chemical
alternations to the nucleotides. More than 60 are found in human RNA of all types: mRNA, tRNA, rRNA, lncRNA,
and the others. These modifications are dynamic; their global quantities change in development and during
disease progression. They are installed by writer enzymes, read by reader proteins and removed by eraser
enzymes, and they have an intrinsic capacity to alter RNA structure and dynamics. They influence translation
initiation and termination, translation fidelity, alternative splicing, trafficking between cellular compartments, and
regulate RNA degradation. RNA reader, writer and eraser proteins are promising drug targets of high current
interest to pharma. In this project, we will develop and commercialize a new approach to detecting, identifying,
and mapping, RNA modifications in a multiplex and with high sensitivity—suitable for clinical samples (e.g.
needle biopsies, FFPE samples) in which only sub-nanogram quantities of RNA may be available. This
technology will be significant because it will provide the first commercial method for profiling and correlating
changes of multiple RNA modification types across the entire transcriptome using low sample input."
10767365,"Certain broadly HIV-neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) are being actively investigated as agents for HIV/AIDS
treatment, functional cure and/or prevention. These bnAbs are classified according to cognate epitopes clusters
on the HIV envelope (Env). Rigorous preclinical studies evince several potential advantages of bnAbs over
currently used antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) in various settings. Currently, optimization of breadth, potency, and
virus escape resistance are primary goals for clinical development. A major issue is that all single bnAbs exhibit
limited coverage of epitope variability/mutability among HIV strains, allowing virus escape. A lead mitigation
strategy proposes triple combinations of bnAb classes for clinical intervention under the premise that polyspecific
reactivity will boost potency and breadth. However, the identification of promising combinations is challenging.
Screening through all possible triple combinations; bnAb class members; and engineered class members via
clinical trials or animal models is an expensive and lengthy process. Therefore, the advancement of bnAb
combinations requires a rational, preclinical selection process based on in vitro analytical systems that inform
prospects for efficacy. Standardized neutralization assays will continue to play an important role; however, the
data can overestimate in vivo potency and escape resistance, fail to capture important determinants of
combination bnAb action, and appear incongruous with clinical outcomes in bnAb prevention or therapy trials.
Past trials of mono or dual bnAb therapy did not achieve sustained virus suppression of viremia; in some cases,
viral rebound occurred via resistance to only one bnAb. This experience reinforces the need for new analytical
techniques that capture additional determinants of potency and escape resistance more thoroughly. Such efforts
should focus on bnAb interactions with wild type virus swarms in plasma, as these are targets for infused bnAbs
and mediate transmission and disease. The development of combination ARV therapies points to instantaneous
inhibition and concurrent bnAb class action as highly relevant measures of potency, breadth, and escape
resistance. The goal of this project is to introduce new capacities to take these measures for various bnAb
combination and test settings, including wild type virus populations in plasma. In ongoing studies, we developed
novel quantitative single molecule and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) detection methods that can
directly measure qualitative and quantitative aspects of triple bnAb class binding to virus populations in plasma.
We hypothesize that our goals will be met by innovative applications of these techniques toward analyses of
bnAb combinations and plasma viruses. Two Specific Aims are: 1) Establish and interpret the interactions of
bnAb combinations with single virions or Env trimers measured by FCS techniques. 2) Characterize interactions
of bnAbs and bnAb combinations with single virions in HIV+ plasma. This project will yield innovative new tools
for evaluating the potency, breadth, and escape resistance of bnAb combination in highly relevant settings of
wild type viruses in plasma that are not efficiently explored by current methods."

Significance: EMPATHIE is a unique learning system that introduces healthcare and science concepts in an
imaginative and engaging platform. The system combines an innovative motion-based game interface with
software that provides an immersive experience into motor control disorders and promotes inquiry-based
challenges. Importantly, lesson modules are presented to the student with a focus on design thinking and
empathy to enable a positive experience for students of diverse of abilities and backgrounds.
Problem to be Addressed: U.S. students rank poorly for performance in science, technology, engineering, and
math (STEM) fields; the number of students who pursue STEM and healthcare careers is not sufficient to meet
the needs of the modern workplace. Interactive digital media (IDM) targeted towards STEM education provide
students with engaging experiences that improve learning and interest in the STEM fields. However, design of
software that is effective for learning and readily applicable to classrooms is a challenging task, particularly
when the goal is to engage a range of socioeconomic groups.
Long-Term Goal: Improve STEM learning and interest in K-12 students from diverse backgrounds.
Phase I Results: During the Phase I effort, a prototype EMPATHIE system was developed and verified to be
functional with electromyography sensors in a classroom setting. Evaluation with middle school students
demonstrated a statistically significant increase in science learning following the EMPATHIE lesson.
Phase II Hypotheses: The SBIR Phase II program will test the hypotheses that students who complete
EMPATHIE lessons, expanded for middle school life science, physical science, and engineering design, will see
statistically significant increases in both science interest and learning compared to a control lesson.
Phase II Summary: Barron Associates, Inc. (award-winning innovators in the field of serious video games) has
partnered with educational leaders who champion design thinking and diversity in STEM for this SBIR Phase II
program. The specific objectives of the Phase II program are to: (1) develop the Phase II commercial-ready
electromyography game-control hardware; (2) conduct participatory design sessions to inform updated game
story frameworks and engagement mechanisms targeted towards a variety of student populations and obtain
feedback from teachers; (3) create lesson content, which expands the Phase I lessons for use in additional science
classrooms, along with teacher training materials; (4) develop the Phase II EMPATHIE game software comprised
of expanded lesson content and learning challenges; (5) perform usability testing; and (6) conduct formal
assessment of learning and engagement levels with middle school students following sessions with the
expanded EMPATHIE game.
Impact: The system will have a significant impact on STEM education by increasing student learning and
promoting interest in healthcare careers."
10925193,"CREST-2 (clinicaltrials.gov number: NCT02089217) is a pair of parallel, actively recruiting procedural trials to prevent stroke comparing: 1) carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and intensive medical management (IMM) to IMM alone, and 2) carotid artery stenting (CAS) and IMM to IMM alone. CREST-2 is designed to have ≈3-year average follow-up (maximum, 4 years). 1,735 patients have been randomized as of 10/29/2020. CREST-2 IMM involves centralized iterative titration to maximum tolerated effect of medications to treat hypertension and hyperlipidemia. We have already demonstrated that CREST-2 IMM results in significant improvements in rates of vascular risk factor control. We propose a highly cost-efficient, centralized process involving telephone and telehealth visits and review of medical records to monitor for stroke endpoints and home health visits to monitor control of vascular risk factors after patients graduate from CREST-2 to assess rigorously the transferability and real-world long-term effectiveness of intensive medical management with or without carotid revascularization. Our proposed long-term observational extension (LOE) is significant regardless of the CREST-2 results. If revascularization fails to show superiority (i.e., if IMM-only treatment is superior or not significantly different), proponents of revascularization will argue that the average follow-up was not sufficiently long to document the benefit of the procedure. The intersection of risk curves in the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study, which supported benefit of CEA compared to medical management, was noted at ≈2 years following study entry. Contemporary IMM likely pushes the point of intersection outward. If revascularization is shown to be superior in CREST-2, then the durability of the benefit of revascularization beyond the 3-year average follow-up will be questioned due to possible restenosis. We propose obtaining written informed consent on all CREST-2 patients for continued follow-up for an additional 5 years, providing a 7.5-year average follow-up, with a subset of patients followed to >10 years. Cost-effectiveness will be achieved through innovative follow-up methodology. Our approach is also designed to minimize patient burden and maximize retention. The primary aim of this proposal is estimation of post- procedure treatment differences between revascularization and IMM vs. IMM alone. The currently funded CREST-2 trial will provide data on post-procedure treatment differences up to ≈3 years. Extending follow-up will enable us to assess whether post-procedure benefit is maintained during intermediate (4-6 years) and long-term follow-up (7-10 years); thereby, testing durability. The primary outcome for the CREST-2 LOE is the composite of stroke and death within 44 days after randomization and ischemic stroke ipsilateral to the randomized vessel thereafter. Our LOE approach is significant because it can be applied to a wide variety of stroke prevention trials where the therapeutic intervention is a device or procedure."

The STAR Program completed its ninth year of funding in 2019 with 91% of program
participants enrolled in or completed biomedical graduate or health professional degrees.
The program has been an integral contributor in effectively training underrepresented
minority, first generation, and economically disadvantaged, students to pursue health,
biomedical, and biobehavioral research pathways. The long-term objective of the
Program’s next five years is to expand its initiatives to increase from 71% to 80% the
number of participants, entering and completing biomedical and behavioral majors and
eventually matriculating into professional/graduate programs. To fulfill this objective, the
UW STAR Program team proposes to bring together an expanded set of activities and a
collaborative team of faculty and staff to implement its initiative. While continuing to
strengthen students’ academic and technical skills, the Program will also focus on helping
participants understand the role of heart, lung, and blood-related research and the
subsequent impact of this research in addressing health disparities in underrepresented
communities. The overarching objective of the University of Washington STAR Program
is to develop innovative programming that will provide underrepresented minority (URM)
students, first generation students, economically and educationally disadvantaged
students, and/or students with disabilities with the conceptual underpinnings and
laboratory experiences that support their goals of pursuing post-undergraduate studies
leading to MD, MD/PhD, PhD, and Masters’ degrees. To fulfill this objective, the STAR
Program will consist of four (4) major components: Teach Lab: a 10 week program that
will introduce rising sophomore and junior level students, without any formal
biomedical/behavioral laboratory experience, to the required, fundamental techniques
and methods of research. The Research Laboratory component will place sophomore
through non-graduating senior/1st year graduate/rising 2nd year medical students for 10
weeks, in mentored laboratory experiences with University of Washington staff involved
in NHLBI-focused research. Retention Activities to keep participants excited about
NHLBI-focused research through researcher-led lectures; encouraging participation in
academic-year laboratory experiences at students’ respective institutions using skills
learned in Teach Lab; and, on-going, holistic advising by program staff. And finally, an
annual Evaluation that will lead to fine-tuning/refinement of Program activities, based on

10915596,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Focal laryngeal dystonia (LD) is a rare neurological voice disorder that interrupts speaking with intermittent
onset of a strained-strangled voice quality or causes voicing to stop or produce sudden breathiness. Those
suffering from LD commonly report onset of symptoms 5 years prior to achieving an accurate diagnosis,
despite seeing multiple experts. Voice tremor (VT) is another neurological voice disorder that is perceived by
listeners as a shaky voice quality. Severe VT can result in voice interruptions that sound similar to LD resulting
in misdiagnosis by experts. Recent research shows poor reliability in distinguishing those with LD from other
voice disorders, largely due to the reliance on perceptual assessment methods and a wide range of clinical
criteria without evidence to guide accurate diagnostic approaches. This is particularly true of VT, a voice
disorder without clearly documented clinical features such that classification is not possible using current
movement disorder consensus-based tremor syndrome criteria. Accurate differential diagnosis of LD from VT
is essential to effective treatment planning and management as well as for accurate clinical and epidemiologic
characterization and classification. The goal of this project is to systematically characterize individuals
with LD and VT using currently available and novel clinical tools to determine distinguishing clinical
features highly predictive of their correct diagnosis. Three studies will be conducted with 65 individuals
each diagnosed by multi-disciplinary consensus to meet criteria for LD and VT as well as 35 neurotypical
normal controls. All participants will undergo thorough screening and testing to assure consensus regarding
their group assignment by experts from speech-language pathology, neurology, and otolaryngology.
Thereafter, clinical phenotypic features will be compared between groups using acoustic, aerodynamic,
laryngeal EMG, and nasoendoscopy to quantify periodicity and task-specificity of voice patterns. Novel
assessment tools and measures will also be used to study body distribution, condition of speech symptoms,
and regularity or intermittency/phoneme-specificity of speech structure movement (kinematic) patterns using
high speed videoendoscopy (HSV), real-time magnetic resonance imaging (rtMRI), and nasoendoscopy
recordings during sustained phonation compared to voice- and voiceless-loaded sentences. Computational
modeling will be used to assess aerodynamic, laryngeal EMG and speech structure kinematic patterns to
simulate patient-specific acoustic output predictive of group membership as VT or LD. Outcomes of this
research will significantly advance our clinical and scientific knowledge regarding optimal clinical tools and
measures of LD and VT clinical features that result in precise diagnosis of these neurological speech
disorders."
10915598,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Laryngeal dysphonia (LD) and Voice Tremor (VT) are neurological voice disorders that impair speech
production. The characteristic feature of LD (i.e., occurring during speaking but not laughing or crying) and the
lack of physical laryngeal abnormalities suggests that LD is likely a disorder affecting the task-specific control
of phonation by the central nervous system (CNS). Similarly, VT is often observed without any clear peripheral
laryngeal etiology, also suggesting a central origin but distinct from that affected in LD. The overall goal of
this project is to characterize the common and distinct features of CNS pathophysiology in the
neurological voice disorders, LD and VT. The act of speech is a dynamic process, including initial glottal
movement, voice onset, and compensatory responses to sensory feedback fluctuations during sustained
phonation. Identifying specific functional impairments in LD and VT requires a clear understanding of when in
the process of phonation, as well as where in the CNS, aberrant activity occurs. Due to their poor temporal
resolution, prior neuroimaging studies have not been able to address the question of when abnormal CNS
activation occurs relative to specific phonation events. As a result, critical clues about the underlying etiologies
in these disorders have likely been missed. Here, we propose a multimodal brain imaging assessment of CNS
abnormalities associated with LD and VT. The specific aims are to examine: 1) Spatial and temporal CNS
pathophysiology during speech and other vocal tasks; 2) Sensorimotor modulations on CNS pathophysiology;
and 3) Motor learning and CNS pathophysiology. Future treatments for LD and VT can be developed by
targeting CNS pathophysiological mechanisms identified in this project. For example, this project will help
identify neural targets that have a therapeutic potential based on disorder-specific pathophysiology for both
invasive and non-invasive brain stimulation."
10915599,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Loss of voice control, which is critical for conveying effective spoken communication, is often a significant
feature in patients with movement disorders, such as dystonia and essential tremor. Voice dysfunction,
however, has been overshadowed clinically by a focus on limb motor symptoms. For example, deep brain
stimulation (DBS) effectively reduces limb dystonia and tremor in these patients, but the modulation of voice
symptoms by DBS has been vastly understudied. It is assumed that the production and modulation of voice are
regulated by the basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical network in a loop architecture that is common to all motor
behaviors. There is, however, little empirical data to inform our specific understanding of how voice function is
encoded in basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical interactions. The overall goal of this Project is to use a
combination of invasive and non-invasive human neuroscience to improve our understanding of the
incidence and neural correlates of neurological voice disorders (laryngeal dystonia and voice tremor)
in patients with isolated dystonia and essential tremor undergoing DBS surgery. We will use
simultaneous electrocorticography (ECoG) and subcortical activity recording in dystonia and tremor patients
who are awake and speaking during DBS implantation surgery. We will supplement these data with non-
invasive, multimodal scalp magneto/electroencephalography (M/EEG) and functional MRI (fMRI) recordings
before DBS surgery and longitudinal M/EEG recordings within one year after surgery to enhance our
understanding of DBS-induced neural network modulation relevant to voice motor symptoms in dystonia and
tremor patients. This work will be facilitated by the fact that all participating Center sites already use the same
equipment and techniques for DBS implantation and will follow standardized experimental protocols. The
disorder-specific intracranial neurophysiological signatures will be correlated with non-invasive imaging
findings, stimulation location defined connectivity maps, and voice outcomes. The results of this Project will
inform the development of strategies for closed-loop brain stimulation specifically to treat neurological voice
dysfunction that can be tested in a subsequent clinical trial."
